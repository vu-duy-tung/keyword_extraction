    "text": "this freaked me out. It was just like the Munich location. Inside and out. I seriously had the creeps the whole time. The only thing different was of course the taste of the food and the language. Both places are full of American tourists!   I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art which is a huge think breaded and fried pork cutlet with a side of cranberry. It also came with potato salad. The pork was bland and really needed the cranberry. The potato salad was standard grocery store variety. My bf had the Jagerschnitzel and we both really liked it. It is the same breaded and fried pork as mine but it was smothered in a gravy of bacon, mushrooms and onions. Its \"hunter style\". It came with Spatzle which was also really creamy and good. My bf has German heritage so if he says the Spatzle tastes like his mom's cooking, then it must be good. We also had potato dumplings and apple sauce on the side, both of which were just ok.   I was pretty happy with the atmosphere and the service, though it is really no contest which Hofbrauhaus I prefer....Munich can't be duplicated completely.",

    "text": "i LOVE this place. Its a bit pricey, but I try to make it every time I'm in vegas. The best nights to go are on a friday or saturday and it really is an authentic german drinking hall. I've been to one in Munic and I really can say this place was like a smaller replica. Seating is similar to that of lunch halls/cafeterias.  The beers are delicious, bigger than my head too. This place is very interactive. They have a live band, servers passing around shots and drinking beers. The pretzels are AMAZING here, but beware. They offer them to you, but they are not free!   Food isn't bad. I always go for the pig knuckle. And those potatoe balls. I dream about potatoe balls everytime I come here.   There's a host also. He's very funny. He pulled me and my girlfriend up on stage sat me on her lap. He then continuted to um.. blow into a giant 10 ft horn, whilst the other end rest at my crotch. It was pretty hilarious. He put the mic in my boobs also, but considering my bosom isn't plentiful I just had to hold it. Then all my girlfriends got to come up and play with the tamborines.  The only shocker of the night was when we got our check. I don't know how we ate and drank so much, but dammit we were drunk and we had a blast!",

    "text": "Good food, good beer.  The liter beers are huge, about the size of my head.  You could kill someone w/ the mug, it was so heavy.  We ordered the chicken bratwurst, veal bratwurst, weiners (kekeke -_-), and pork cutlet entrees along with two pretzel apeptizers - one was some garlic type tip, and the other was chicken liver.  I was surprised the chicken liver didnt taste bad, but I dont think i'd recommend it.  The pretzels were awesome though, with the other dips.  The chicken bratwurst seemed too dense and was really filling - it's like they packed a whole chicken into the two bratwursts.  The weiners were soo good, wish we had some buns to put them in (thats what she said).  But really, we all thought they'd be amazing with buns and ketchup.  The pork cutlet was huge, took up the entire plate and was also really good with the spicy mustard.  All the entrees came w/ a side, like mashed potatoes.  I had the liter hef to drink (it was great), and i was surprised i left standing (lightweight, i know O_o).  All the entrees are large portions, so you'll definitely leave feeling full.  The dining area was cool, felt kind of like a cafeteria.  We came around 2pm so there weren't that many people there, but I bet it would be so fun eating and drinking there when its packed, with live music going on.  Next time I come i want to try some of their fish specials, but being my first time there, it just didn't sound right not getting bratwurst.  The service was great, really attentive and gave us recommendations on what people liked.  The manager also said it was cool for us to leave the car parked in their private lot and walk across the street to the hard rock too.  I'll be back.",

Food was great, beer a bit pricey but it is Vegas. We felt like the server pushed a $13 Bretzel on us even before we had a chance to look at the menu and the Oktoberfest beer, it was like it was going bad and they were trying to sell it before it went bad. Beer was good and being vegetarian we ordered 5 side dishes to split. We each had a masse (Litre stein/32 oz of beer) our bill came to around $100. Expect to spend between $35-$50 per person if you eat and have a drink or two. Great spot to take a large group to drink if you want something different.",

Trick them into thinking they can have all this beer and once they are woozy you can trick them into getting a Yager shot/Paddle spanking!

Since then I've been dying to go and relive the experience I had at the Hofbrauhaus in Munchen last summer but I'm not too sure about it after reading the reviews!! In Germany, even though the conversion rate from dollar to euro is crap, our meal was still inexpensive. I'm a vegetarian so I ordered the mushroom soup. Which probably had chicken broth in it, but eh, what you don't know won't hurt you and I was starving. And in Germany. Not many options for a strict vegetarian anyway. it was delicious and pretzels were..hmm. about 1.50 euro if my memory serves me correctly?? So with last year's conversion rate of $1.35 = 1 euro, it would have been under $3 for one pretzel!   Paying $13 for one pretzel is going to be a bummer...maybe I won't check this out when i head to vegas on Monday, maybe I'll let it wait for when we go in August...",

On the other hand one has to admit that even the original Hofbrauhaus is not really a decent place to begin with. It lives as a legend and ain't a place where locals go to anymore.   First time we went there was with a group of international guests from all over the world, including some real Germans and specifically Bavarians. For me as a German I did not find the place to be very accurate but instead it was simply a selection of certain stero types most of the world thinks are typical German qualities. It starts with the music (an Austrian band played that evening), goes on with the beer (which is indeed the same beer as served here) and finishes with the wannabe German food. Very few of the available dishes were really German, most seemed to be americanized variations which is understandable since most Americans would probably dislike real German food to begin with.   The waitress who took care of our group was simply overwhelmed and in a place like that I would expect the staff to at least understand you if you order from the menu in properly pronounced German. Not that evening, she placed several orders incorrectly and had troubles getting the drinks in the right order.   Would I go there again? Unlikely. Do I think most Americans would enjoy the place? Sure, no question about that. ;)",

Awesome German grub, pretty blond waitresses in authentic German garb (and they're nice, too!), and pretty much all the weiners and spaetzel you can eat. Cheap for the amount of everything you get, too.   There's a live band most evenings, and it can be a little hard to hear, but that's why they serve massive quantities of beer. They WANT you to yell at the top of your lungs, get all red in the face, overheat, and then barf in the bathroom. Yes, yes, I did. But the bathrooms are right next to the lovely beer garden, so be sure to poke your head in there for a peek.   Love this place. Love it!",

We dined in the beer garden which is made to look like your outside With the blue sky and trees etc. You think your outside but your not. Being a Saturday night the place was jumping with great live music. They had a beerstein holding contest which was fun to watch. The whole atmosphere is like one big party for both young and old.  As for the food and beer it's very good and I've been to Germany many times. We tried the Nuenberer Rostbratwurst (3 sausages with sauerkaut and mashed potatoes ) $13:95 yum. The Wiener Schnitzel (breaded pork culets with cranberries and homemade Bavarian potato salad ) $18:95 was Huge and enough for two. Almost every table ordered the Jumbo pretzel ( with cheese and two kinds of mustard) $12:95 pricy but so good and a great starter to share. All the beer is imported from German and served in huge beersteins. The staff and servers all dress in old time german outfits that look cool. I've saved the best for last the ( PADDLE GIRLS ). The paddle girls are servers who bring you a shot that someone has sent you and after drinking it you bend over and get spanked. This goes on all night with screams and cheers from the crowds of guest enjoying the fun. Hofbrauhaus will be opening their first California restaurant in cupertino. It will open  this coming June in the Valco mall . I can't wait !",

Tasted like the other German food I've had before albeit a bit processed? Ok price for a strip based meal ( it's across from hard rock hotel but treated as if on Strip price wise.) Didn't get the 'get your ass paddled' thing at all- bf wanted a shot of fireball and once he had it , the girl paddled his behind (hard I may add) ?

Convenient to the airport this is a great place for groups who want to have a fun night out-especially a group of guys that want to get spanked by a sexy waitress after doing a shot.  Surprisingly a mix crowd and lucky for us we were not sitting near any spanking!   We had a whole table to ourselves since it was early-big large size benches and tables, vaulted painted ceilings and a huge stage with a large band playing German music which kept the crowd singing along.  Food and beer yummy.  We had this place bookmarked for a while and it was nice to come in and order some Spaetzel, beer, pretzels, potato soup, hot dogs, schnitzel and salad.  Service from start to finish was excellent.  We were seated right away from the friendly hostess and waitress was very attentive. Fun place to come and have some fun.",

I recommend the Jager Schniztel and spatzle. I wish I'd had room for dessert, but the portions are quite large. If you have a larger group you can share a cheese plate and a dessert. Enjoy!",

The service, the entertainment, and the beer were great! I'd highly recommend to people who enjoy German food and are looking to have fun as it is a high energy, loud, casual, fun environment (restaurant is very spacious). If you order a shot you can get spanked with a large paddle (very themed). It's also conveniently located, just a block or two behind LV Blvd.  Parking is pretty limited so if you catch it on a busy night, your kinda SOL.",

    "text": "I had completely forgotten about this place until I saw this on my feed recently. Although it's been a while, seeing the name brought back some random memories.   Not by choice, I was taken here by some people I was staying with while visiting Las Vegas. From what I recall, I believe this was part of a business get-together, obviously off the clock. First thing I thought of when we walked into the vast dining room was an ivy league university cafeteria of years past. There were long dark-wooded tables (or they were pushed together, it's a blur) and the acoustics were terrible, meaning the singing/music that would come later on would fill the room to the extreme. If you were trashed, either you were covering your ears from the noise with your head down on that table, or better yet, you were joining in the singing although you didn't speak a word of German (don't worry, most there probably don't either).   German food is not my specialty (I can only think of things I tolerate, like Black Forest Cake and pretzels, and then a bunch of other things I don't eat). Pretty much made this a pretzel-night and damn, they obviously do these treats proud. Normally not one to slather this in mustard, they had this amazing mustard that really blended the flavor. There were a couple other dipping sauces provided but I stayed faithful to that mustard.   Definitely not a place I would select myself, but I made the most of it. The company was certainly interesting, and I do have to admit, everyone seemed to be having a grand time, whether slapping each other on the back, clinking beer mugs, or just laughing in general. God, I might have actually had fun. I imagine a fight would be epic here, if one were to break out (none did while I was there, thankfully).",

    "text": "We came out here for a friend's birthday on Friday night.  Being an avid yelper, I decided to read up on some reviews.  After reading the reviews, I was a little nervous about going, to be honest.  I was really worried that  I wouldn't like any of the food...especially after reading the menu...I'm not really big on pork products, and there is a lot of pork on the menu. lol  So...we got there, and walked in, and were seated... What a HUGE hall!   At first, I was uncomfortable...it felt like it was a million and a half degrees in that place.  Oddly enough, the more I ate and drank, the better I felt. ;)  The atmosphere here is definitely one of carefree partying.   Its loud.  There is lots of singing, music, shouting, chanting, and spanking. I had a blast.  I personally did not have any shots...something about being spanked by a stranger with a paddle is not super appealing to me.  Maybe in the bedroom with someone I know, but not in public...those ladies looked pretty strong too. :)  Now onto what was ordered:  Beer: I ordered the Hefeweizen, which was awesome.  The half liter was $8...it lasted me the whole time we were there, so it was a good value, but...I'm a slow beer drinker.  The other beers were really good too.  (I tasted everyone's.)  Food: I ordered: A pretzel:  Pretty good.  Salty, but not overly so.   The potato pancakes with smoked salmon:  THIS was delicious.  I'm a sucker for potato pancakes, but there were divine.  The salmon was delicious, and the presentation was great.  (I'll upload a picture as soon as I can.) German Potato Soup:  This was DELICIOUS!  My favorite of the night. :) The Majoram/ (Veal sausages):  Since I'm not a big fan of pork products, I had intended on getting fish or chicken...but when I saw that there were veal sausages for the same price as the chicken...I opted for those.  They were tasty.  2 sausages served over mashed potatoes, with a red cabbage sauerkraut.  (I wasn't a fan of the red cabbage.)  All in all the quality of the food was good.   However... Between myself and my roommate, we spent $85 on 3 beers, two entrees, and two small starters.   I could have eaten better food for half that cost elsewhere, but all in all, for a fun night out for a friend's birthday, it was a fun place to go.",

I was really enjoying it before the food came.   I was less than impressed with our stale pretzel, thankfully we had beer cheese to soften it otherwise I probably would have just spit it out.   My meal was down right awful. I ordered the frankfurter and nearly gagged when they brought it out to me. The hot dogs were served in a giant bowl full of wiener water and looked bey unappetizing. The potato salad was the saving grace because that was delicious. The frankfurter tasted like boiled hot dogs. Nothing fancy and certainly not worth the money.   I left with an uneasy feeling in my stomach and a nasty taste in my mouth. Yuck.",

We had a party of 10 and friends wanted to go but I had never been. There was a German band that also sang some American songs and makes sure to keep the crowds upbeat. One side of the floor had large tvs and a game on. The other side had a band to keep us entertained. The shots/schatz are hilarious. Don't order if you don't know.",

    "text": "Got a big group and a ton of money burning a hole in your pocket? Like legit beer? Too tired to make sauerbraten at home? Don't mind not being able to hear your dinner partner and sitting next to strangers? If you answered \"Ja\" then Hofbrauhaus is your next stop in Vegas!  I've been to Hofbrauhaus four times now, twice during the day and twice at night, and I can say that Hofbrauhaus is so fun. I've been here three times with my sister, once with my aunt and uncle who lived in Germany and once with Beau S., and regardless of the company, I have a great time. If you have a large group, this is definitely the place to check out.   I've never once had to wait for a table. I've only eaten in the beer garden and it gets LOUD. Between the musicians, the chants of \"Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi,\" the ambient noise, and the steins clinking or crashing to the ground, it gets so loud, having a conversation is a bit pointless.   If you're not an agoraphobic recluse that's cool with sitting next to strangers, you'll love this place. I highly recommend the obatzter cheese appetizer and the potato soup. Also, the sauerbraten is good, but I'd not order the gigantic fried chicken cutlet (I forgot the name and IDK if they even serve it anymore) stick to the super German stuff and you'll be fine.   Oh, and sign up for their newsletter because you immediately get a coupon for a free 10 oz beer with the purchase of an entree.",

Which- fine- we'll live. but it was WAY too hot in their. they kept shoving more people in there and with all the lights and movement it was uncomfortable. I ended up sitting at the bar in the lobby for the entire time. i couldn't sit with my party because it was so unbearable. the gift shop staff was friendly, but the bartender was extremely rude and short with me, and the hostess acted like she didn't even work there.

Variety of sausages ... unfortunately they are not made in their kitchen. My favorite item is from the dinner menu: The Hunter's Platter, varieties of meats and sausages, mashed potatoes and red cabbage. They don't serve it at lunchtime! Don't even try to ask!  I ended up ordering a pretzel! Over priced! My friend ordered a sausage platter. Asked to switch some of the sides, and the waitress said NO. She didn't offer to order separate sides from the menu. She just said \"No substitution\". Well, not liking what the original order was, we decided to ask for the check. Paid for the drinks and the pretzel, and left! The waitress didn't care less ...  Well, I did care, because I always had excellent experience here, and I wanted to introduce this place to my friend, who was a first time guest here! Also I love their apple strudel, and I wanted to eat it! Instead of that we left with a bittersweet taste in the mouth!  The place has a great atmosphere, excellent entertainment (live bands most of the time) with authentic music. Very loud, but very original! Being a local, 24 years, I am very spoiled with good food and service! Based on our last experience, I won't break my leg to hurry up to come back, especially with new friends!",

The kind of sliced bread you buy at the grocery store to make sandwiches. When I said \"we only get one piece of bread?\" The bar tender, Joey, replied sarcastically  \"I only put in an order for one, do you want another order put in?\" Apparently, you have to pay $1.29 for each slice of bread to eat with your meal.

I get that this is a Vegas themed resturant but they should try to come at least close to the original. The jager scnitzel I had was bland and chewy and at $20 should have been way more flavorful than it was considering it was a small piece of meat with a tiny portion of spatzle. The spatzle wasn't bad and was pretty close to what I had in Germany but had the taste like it was made a few days ago and not fresh.  The real negative part of this is that we had a group of 16 and even though we had a reservation got slammed into a table that had a bunch of dudes on a bachelor party snuggled up way too close.  The worst part was at the end somehow with an average price of about $30 per person spent on food and drink (pre-tax and tip) we all ended up needing to throw in $60 each to make it work after tax and tip (they wouldn't split the tab). Seems like we got over charged but with a group that size it was hard to determine how that happened.  I will say the music was fun and the decor was right on point so it does have the german vibe going for it.",

The beers are huge and light's not an option so if you're going to order a beer be prepared to drink. It sounds like lately the entertainment has mostly been a one-man band but I've seen a full band play here in the past. All the gals are wearing German Bar Maid outfits (which become a bit more revealing in the later hours in the evening versus coming in for lunch) which is definitely a sight to see and they'll give ya a shot of whatever liquor is available if you'll let one of them paddle your arse.  Decided to go with the Bavarian equivalent to Bangers and Mash (Sausage, Mashed Potatoes, and Sauerkraut rather than peas) which was delicious and considering how filling the beer was, just the right amount for me.  If you've got about $25/head and are debating whether to stop in, go. You'll have a great time. They also have a private photographer offering photos for $15 and $20. If you have a digital camera, their frame isn't worth the $15, but if not, go for it.",

The beer is unreal and the you have to have at least a liter of something. Next time I am for sure bringing a large group and I will tackle a 2  liter Das Boot myself. The prices are probably 15-10% higher than they should be but again this is something you need to experience for sure!",

    "text": "Worthy of zero or negative stars--but gotta pick one to leave a warning for others... We visited the Vegas location this past Sunday evening during our first trip to Vegas. I'm sorry to report that we actually walked out during ordering due to the no substitution policy. I have never ever been mad enough to walk out of a restaurant. This was a first for me.    My daughter wanted a schnitzel with something other than vinegar based german potato salad. We were told that substitutions were not allowed! When I asked the waitress to clarify that (ridiculous) statement--she smugly said that it is right there on the menu!! Are you kidding me? My kid is supposed to eat something she dislikes? Here is where I rant a little--   If I agree to pay for the unwanted potato salad will the cooks be kind enough to scrape it in the trash for me so the vinegar won't get on my daughter's $20 pork cutlet?! Are these TV dinners where the cooks just heat them in the oven and rip the plastic off the top? Is it permitted that I purchase an additional side of mashed or fried potatoes; or does my daughter first have to plug her nose and eat the potato salad?! This was the only bad experience we had in Vegas. All the other restaurants were great--especially the two Wolfgang Puck ones. (Wolfgang Puck Bar and  Grill at the MGM was beyond awesome. Best wings ever!)    We have eaten at the Hofbrauhaus in Pittsburgh on several occasions. In fact, every time we visit Pittsburgh from Virginia. Never once did they question what sides we wanted. The experiences in Pittsburgh are why we visited in Las Vegas, but Vegas location really was shameful. I can't believe they seriously expect customers to sit there shut up and eat what they are told to eat? Shame on the customers for not walking out as well. Damn sheep...   I was looking for the hidden cameras and waiting for someone to stop us as we stormed out the door. No one gave us a second look. The only employees that seemed concerned in any way was the valet parking crew which apologized profusely. What does that tell you about the staff inside the place?    What a truly awful experience. It was the only unpleasant memory from an otherwise awesome vacation. My stomach hurts just sitting here and recounting our experience.",

Environment: As expected, this place is very loud. We were the furthest from the stage but still couldn't hear everyone at our table.   Overall I would NOT recommend this place. The staff was very pretentious and cold. The food wasn't very good at any price and while the live entertainment was fun, the pretentious waitresses took away too much from the environment.   I would not recommend this place under any circumstances.",

The entire table looked down at me as my salad headed my way.  I knew I was hungry so I also ordered the creamy mushrooms since the waitress said that the serving size was like that of a side dish and would go perfectly with the salad. Now...either she lied or she has one hell of an appetite.  My salad was rather blah and nor did it feel healthy as the chicken was kinda greasy.  And the creamy mushrooms....well, there were less mushrooms than cream.  And in between it all was this like huge ball of stuffing.  It was actually pretty good, but definitely not healthy.  And my non-beer drinking self...well, I washed it down with some good ol' iced tea :-)  The atmosphere was loud....pretty loud, but still exciting and fun.  Don't expect to hold any type of conversation while there, but do expect to get an opportunity to be spanked.  Yes...literally.  With a big paddle.  I think you get a free shot with every spank.  Oh yeah, and they take your picture as well.  Oooo...their hot pretzel....EXCELLENT!",

I ordered the chicken sausage to eat, but after a total of 3 liters of beer I can't give an honest, sober review of the food, but I loved it.

We walked into the enormous beer hall with people dancing on the tables, weaving around the room in dancing chains and singing at the tops of their lungs. The band looked like a traditional German band, but instead of belting out the German classics that no one knows, they were belting out Neil Diamond and other classic American hits that we all know and can sing too.   There were chugging contests and the lederhosen clad star waiter laid down on his back, on a table and played a 10 foot  Ricola style horn - I am not kidding.  The beer is awesome and the food is yummy and authentic, albeit a little mass-produced.  If you want some good ol' Bavarian beer hall fan, I can't think of a better place to go outside of the real thing. They really went all out replicating the original.",

The cheese noodles were not as bad, but they would not be ordered again.    One warning...we ordered a jumbo pretzel (highlight of the meal) and we were 'encouraged' to order beer cheese with it...for $4.50.  The beer cheese was good, but completely unnecessary since the $14 pretzel came with delicious mustards.  Have the pretzel and mustard and skip the cheese.  Again, have dinner, come here for beer, music, and pretzels and you will be a happy camper.",

Let me start by saying that! I actually got pretty disgusted with the size of the schnitzel as it got pretty sickening after awhile. I wanted to have this as I really missed it from Germany. It didn't quite live up to my standards.   Great for groups as it's a beer hall type of venue with lots of long tables, super high ceilings with intricate paintings on it, and musical performers.   The funny thing was watching different tables order shots. They come on a paddle and basically the person takes the shot then gets a smack in the butt. Looked so painful! Especially the looks on all the guys faces. Only guys have the guts and the butt to withstand that I guess. The waitresses are also all dressed in the German dresses which further adds to the ambiance. Would have given more stars had the food been better.",

It wasn't a crowded night and yet I still had a good time.  The music was blaring, the spankings were being dolled out, the beer was flowing and those there were having a great time.   The beer was good, the food was just alright imo, and the schnapps were weak and generic and should be avoided.  I did take place in the stein holding competition and although I didn't win, it was a blast!  The staff were very kind and entertaining and if you want, you can get a spanking if you order a shot.  They have a bar which is away from the music but I would suggest going inside with the fun.  It's louder but worth it.  They also have a back garden room where you can play beer pong and large games which is a bit quitter if you are into that. Go here to have a good time and revel in a little bit of German tradition!",

    "text": "Came here a few months ago (around Oktoberfest) and yelp reminded me I needed to review it! So I came with some friends and I ordered the Jagerschnitzel. In my opinion you don't come here for the food but more of the atmosphere. The dish as a whole was a little bland to me...but I'm not too familiar with German food and what's considered quality. The best part was the bacon...which is hard to make bland haha...but surprisingly, the cranberry added a nice (and different) flavor to the dish. But again, I wasn't satisfied with the taste of the dish and I think its quite expensive (boo!). However, the atmosphere is fun. Most know that there is dancing on tables, live music, some of the employees will come around and give spankings with wooden paddles, etc. The crowd is typically older I've noticed (we were all late 20's and early 30's) but its still a hilarious time seeing everyone enjoying themselves. We did take a shot-ski (a line of shots on a ski) which was pretty cool! So again, its more of the atmosphere and beer/drinks that makes this place so great, but I won't come here with an empty stomach and hoping to have a savory dinner.",

They offer something called a \"shot and a swat\" where one of their waitresses will spank you with a wooden paddle three times if you order a shot. I didn't partake in this, but several members of my table did. They each ended up with bruised butt cheeks for days. The food was god awful. Room temperature at best and everything was extremely dry. This is definitely a place to come for a beer but skip the munchies to go with it and pick them up elsewhere.",

    "text": "Great German food and beer. Amazing customer service and entertainment.   This restaurant has 2 sections - the first when you walk in is the main room (pretty big) and a small stage is located at one of the corners; and a second room (also very big) which is called the Biergarten (the beer garden), I will just call it the Garden. Both are closed roof rooms. The first one is louder. The second one is quiter and more romantic, it has a fountain in the middle. I think there is also a second floor in the Garden with terraces overlooking the Garden, but I think it was closed that day, no one was sitting there.  I went with my family - wife and 2 kids. We sat in the Garden, which is recommended for groups with kids. The waitress and bussers are fast, very helpful and super friendly. Our waitress was from the Czech Republic (originally) which is next to Germany and she had a perfect knowledge of the cuisine and suggested us the most amazing dishes. She was great and very helpful.   The appetizers came fast. We ordered  (102) Kartoffelpuffer - 3 potato pancakes and salmon and (111) Gurkensalat - cucumber salad with vinegar dressing. Both were really good and I recommend them to try.  We also ordered their house beer. It was very tasty, but not too heavy.  Next came the kids meals - they do have a kid's menu, but what we did is we ordered the chicken schnitzel dinner and split it in 2 for the kids. It's pretty big. It is (260) Schnitzelelsemmel for $15.99 and instead of bread we substituted for an order of french fries. Plus we orderer another portion of french fries. The fries are very good as well.  My wife ordered the pork schnitzel dinner which comes with the small German pasta and mushroom sauce. It is this one - (375) Jagerschnitzel for $19.99. I ordered a chicken dinner which has the same pasta and mushroom sauce. It is this one - (390) Gegrillte Hahnchenbrust for $18.99. They are both good and almost the same actually, just one is with pork schnitzel, the other is with grilled chicken. I recommend you try one of them.   The food, the beer and the service are all 5 stars. We were very happy how everything tasted. We took a lot of it home cause we couldn't finish it and it tasted good the next as well.  There is also constant entertainment in the restaurant. At least if you go Fri, Sat or Sun - they have live music or other events. There was a band in the main room which plays half of the night when we were there. People jump on their chairs or benches and start dancing. At the Garden it is a bit quiter. There are some sexy dressed women though, which walk around and spank people. You give them a tip and they can spank you or your friend. It's funny. And last, but not least, I love the decor and the traditional German outfits the personnel is wearing. Everything is made so that you really feel you are in a traditional German restaurant.   Come and check it out. You won't regret it!",

The biggest disappointment was the beer. It wasn't even cold, it was room temperature and very overpriced. In Munich a liter costs 9 Euros (about $10 USD) for a cold German beer brewed in Germany. Here it's was $17 for a liter that wasn't even filled to the top liter and not cold.  The bread is not as fresh. The potato soup here doesn't come close to the original one. It was bland and lukewarm. The large pretzel, although double the price, was really good. All in all... I'm glad I experienced it. But my bill was double the price for less food and even less quality than the original. If this is Las Vegas and this Hofbrauhaus is supposed to be a replica... it failed miserably. If ever in Munich, Germany give Hofbrauhaus a real chance and you'll see what it's supposed to be about.",

The place is set up beer hall style using long tables and benches instead of individual chairs.   Hofbrau brews a delicious beer and you can't go wrong with the hefeweizen. Recommend getting the large pretzel to snack on whether your group is small or large.  I took one star off because of an issue I had with a gift card. While working in southern Ohio, I visited the northern Kentucky location and purchased a gift card for a friend's birthday, knowing we would be going to the Vegas restaurant while out here.  What I wasn't told when purchasing, is that if you purchase a gift card at a location, you have to use it at that particular location.  Management, please inform your patrons of this fact.",

Since it wasn't busy, they let it slide this time, said by a not so friendly hostess. It wasn't even half full and yet it took 15min at least for a waitress to come by. Just got some beers for now. That eventually came back with a lot of foam head. I let mine settle and it looked about 3oz was missing. Eventually ordered some appetizers and then a desert. Food was ok. Desert was great. Came time to leave, I paid in cash with tip already factored in, no change needed. The minute we stand up which was about 10min later, the waitress runs over and in between us damn near knocking us down to get the bill and open it to make sure we paid. Too bad she didn't run over to take our order when we first got there and welcome us. Not sure if I'll be back.",

While it's not an exact replica (and the food isn't quite the same), the True German essence is captured through the boisterous atmosphere, authentic imported beer and decidedly German menu. I love to take out of town visitors here, and I visit a couple of times a year when I'm missing the gorgeous country of Germany -- one of my favorites I've ever visited.  You'll find the as-big-as-your-head pretzels and all sizes of cold beer (from bashfully mini to \"holy cow\" huge), and and certain times during the year there will be a good German band playing live. Even if you aren't a beer drinker, it's just crazy to come here and not order a beer! It's so good and there's something for everyone from super light to the darkest of the dark. Come during Oktoberfest and you can drink their truly exceptional imported specialty beer. Don't forget a designated driver!  This is a great restaurant for large groups as the venue is equipped to handle them. Patrons sit at long, shared tables (just like in Munich), so be prepared to make friends! Kids seem to love the place too because they can dance around and jump to the music.      The German food is authentic and tasty. Not fantastic but good (and overpriced). There's a great tiny gift shop in the lobby with cool beer steins, stuffed bear toys, funny hats and lederhosen. The waitresses wear just sexy enough drindls, a big plus for the men in your party. I know my husband and his buddy enjoyed taking a shot and getting paddled by one of the ample-bosomed girls on our last visit. Yes, you can get bent over a table and paddled. It's a gimmick but it's funny to watch guys whoop and holler.    The mostly concrete beer hall is huge and cavernous (just like in Germany), so be warned that this is not a place to come for an intimate dinner or soft conversation. It is loud, loud, LOUD in there. When the crowds get heavy, the band gets even louder. Pounding on tables, stomping on the floor, drunken singing and shouting out toasts is not only tolerated but openly encouraged. If you know the chicken dance you will have a blast.   While the noise is to be expected, the biggest negative is the service; I don't think I've ever had good service here but that's okay. You'll most likely be too busy stuffing your face with pretzels and beer to worry about that!",

    "text": "We love the Hofbrauhaus after visiting the one in Munich several times. I was pleasantly surprised to learn that there was one in Las Vegas. My wife and I made reservations for Thanksgiving dinner. We were seated quickly and enjoyed the festive atmosphere as the musicians played traditional German music. Although they had special Thanksgiving turkey dinner, were craving German food. I ordered the sausage platter with sauerkraut and potato salad. My wife had the Weinersnitzel plate and we both had a large house beer.  For dessert we had the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream. Everything tasted delicious, much the same as the Hofbrauhaus restaurants in Germany. The service was great and the prices were good for being in Vegas. Can't wait to visit again when I'm in town.",

Large group benches in the main dining area and a Biergarten in the back. It's definitely on the touristy side.  Service is very friendly and efficient.  Food - I really don't love German food to be honest.  With that said, who doesn't love a great soft pretzel? These are flown in from Germany and you can tell.  They are excellent.  The sausages are also very authentic (I went with a group of Germans who confirmed this) and I think they hit the mark for quality, authentic execution.    Options are limited as 90% of the menu is pork based.  So know what you are coming for.  The German draft beers were very good and come in liters and half liters.    Overall I'm glad we came and is a great spot for large groups.",

    "text": "I always pass by this place on Paradise on my way to the airport and now I can finally say I've stepped foot in this German beer hall. Apparently this was a recreation of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich. Everyone comes for the beer, which is served in three different sizes, but let's be real - you want the one served in the giant one liter stein. Of the beers to choose from, they have the classic Bavarian lager, a darker lager, and a hefe weizen.   The menu consists of some traditional Bavarian fare such as sausage, sauerkraut, potatoes, schnitzel, and the giant pretzel. I was quite disappointed by the \"freshly baked\" pretzel as it was very dry and tough. The cold \"Obazter\" cheese dip didn't help matters. If you're a fan of sausage, try the Hofbrauhaus wurstplatte for a combination of Vienna style frankfurters, pork, and chicken sausages with sides of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. Personally, I loved the Jagerschnitzel. Nothing says you're hungry like a big pork cutlet topped with mushrooms, bacon, and onions with a side of spatzle. If you're still hungry for dessert, the apple strudel with vanilla ice cream was delicious.   There's live entertainment that comes on at night, which makes this place even more fun. But, you can always start your own entertainment at your very own table. This is the perfect place for a large group. If you find yourself in such a situation, be sure to order shots for that one naughty boy or girl. Each shot comes on a paddle. After that unfortunate guy or gal downs the shot, the beer maid gives that person a thunderclap paddling that echoes throughout the hall (why do you think they built the ceilings to be so high?). I'm still sore just thinking about it.   Come one, come all. You will enter sober and leave with a headache, no memory of what happened, and unsure why your left buttcheek hurts so much.",

Weekends tend to get a little crowded (around 730-8pm), so making a reservation (inside the beer hall) is what i recommend!  All the servers have been awesome, except for when they litterally chase you down in the gift shop and remind you that if you buy something it HAS to be under their name... strange and annoying, but other then that, the food and atmosphere is amazing!

We were looking for a place to eat that would accommodate of all us at a reasonable price. One of my friends had been to the real Hofbrauhaus in Germany and thought it would be a a good place to go.   It was a huge dinning hall. Live music, that played all sorts of German music along with 70's and 80's cover songs. Random but so cool. Every few minutes they yelled,   \"Ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy,\"  While raising the Stein and toasting to the evening.   Of coarse having German heritage and my last name being Kriege, I felt at home in this place. I loved everything about it. The atmosphere is one in a million. The food was great and authentic German food. They have 3 different house beers to choose from. Tried all of them but the Hefe is still my favorite.   OK, I didn't want to spoil it but the best part was there is a Jager girl who walks around with shots. But the catch is you have to get spanked by her wooden paddle after you take your shot. And she's a feisty one.   Jager girl+ steins of beer+ good food + amazing atmosphere= the best experience ever!",

I was here for my friend's bachelor party and we had a blast. The Hofbrauhaus reminds so much of my time in Munich. You have people standing up on the benches swaying, chugging and singing German songs.  The music is arguably as much a part of the festival as the liquid gold itself.  The place is filled with happy, merry and drunken people.   Since we had a big party, we made reservation and were seated right away. The food was very authentic. I decide to go with the Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte, which came with 3 different types of sausages (Vienna Style Frankfuters, Pork and Chicken) with Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes. The sausages were DELICIOUS but I was left still hungry. I was able to fill my hunger with the 1 L of Hef beer. It pretty much HIT the spot!  The service was EXCELLENT!  Our waitresses, dressed in traditional Bavarian clothing, carried ten 1-liter beer steins in their hands. It's astounding how they can handle the weight.   I came in sober and left tipsy and violated. What a night at the Hofbrauhaus!!!",

We had the Jager girl come by a few time to give the bachelor a few shots and a few slaps with the paddle.

Have plenty of friends who rave about it and it lived up to my expectations.   Service was great, staff were friendly and helpful. Food was great. I along with a few friends ordered #365. They always order that and after checking the menu I decided to give it a try. Loved it.   This is not for a quiet dinner. If that is what you were looking for then you chose wrong and it's not their fault. That's like saying you go to Oktoberfest to read books and relax. No, you go to have fun and drink. That is what Hofbrauhaus provides. A fun place for drinking and good German food. Very simple formula and since it's been here for quite a few years now, they must be doing it right.   Look forward to going back again soon!",

Huge steins of beer, a German girl dishing out shots and then punishing your friends with a wooden paddle, fun music, contests and an overall great atmosphere. Even if you aren't a polka fan (like me) you will find yourself clanking your beer glasses together and singing along with the other patrons.

Their Jaggersnitzel is to die for!  I also tried sides of their spatzle and potato salad.  Spatzle is always never as good as I hope it sounds it will be but, it was ok and their potato salad was really good.  I love a good potato salad and those Germans know how to make it!  My boyfriend got a sausage plate and he did enjoy it although he's not a fatty food fan!  I also got a small Das Boot!!  It was small and plastic and I really wanted the larger glass one but, those were over 70$ and too much beer for me!  But, my small Das Boot was all I needed and it was filled with the most delicious Hefeweizen I have ever put my lips on!! Holy Cow I dream about that beer to this day!! When I'm in Vegas it's a guarantee I will be headed back here!!  The atmosphere is awesome, large vaulted ceilings and picnic table style seating.  It is an exact replica of the one in Munich Germany.  So cool felt like a travel without leaving Las Vegas!!",

It's an excellent replica of the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and it maintains the lively and robust, fun atmosphere.  The main room are filled with benches, situated very close to one another.  Beers come in Liter steins, and if you go during Oktoberfest, there's a special brew!    Off the menu are 3.0 liter acrylic boots.  They'll fill it up about 2.0 L or 2.5 L of beer, and you get to keep the boot afterwards.  Or you can drink the little girl's sippy cup (0.3L) and be ridiculed by all your friends.  :)  Also off the menu, but available, are pork knuckles (only on Saturday).  This is a change from when I went last time, when they didn't have it; however, go early, they tend to run out.  It's German food, so for the most part your \"variety\" is limited to different meats in sausages, or some kind of veal or pork cutlet.   In addition to the food, there is a live band (or at least one performer, depending on when you go) who contribute to the liveliness.  Winners of little contests (pretzel eating contest, beer stein-carrying contests, name that song contests) receive a wrapped 1.0 L stein to take home ($16.99 value, purchasable from the gift shop).    A fun place to socialize, drink with strangers, and have a grand old time!",

    "text": "Visited: May 29th, 2011  My friend Kerri made a reservation for 3pm for this place they day before. Ania, one of Isabel's friends suggested that we go to this place. I do believe that Isabel had taken her then boyfriend (now husband) to this place on their anniversary (as an unmarried couple late last year). I was down to try a German/Bavarian restaurant and see what foods they had to offer. Ania, Kerri (went to the Munich location), and Isabel said that this place was good. Of course, I don't know what \"good\" German/Bavarian food is supposed to taste like.   We went to Hofbrauhaus after our windy and cold experience at Marquee Dayclub. It was still windy as we were walking in, but inside was nice and toasty. :) I absolutely loved the architecture in this building as well as the artwork and the long, wooden \"family style\" tables.  We were sat down and within a few minutes we were ready to order. Our server was pretty friendly.  I ended up ordering the Creamy Bavarian Potato Soup w/ sliced sausage and the Obazter Classic Bavarian Appetizer while everyone else ordered meat items. None of us ordered any beer, although I was pretty tempted to order a stein. Isabel ordered the shot that came with a paddle spanking, and ordered it for that reason. I know a few people in the restaurant ordered it, and when I saw the spankings and how much they hurt those people, I was not about to order it. When Isabel got her spanking, she was a freakin' champ, only a little hop. lol....   Anyway, our food took a little while to come to our table, but it was well worth it. My soup was creamy and tasty, and not salty and my appetizer was so good. The pretzel was soft and it was perfect with the seasoned brie & cream cheese dip, however, I consumed the pretzel before I even finished the two mounds of cheese dip. I ended up having to order another pretzel to finish it off. The girls seemed to enjoy the food and the festivities, which included the chicken dance. This occurred after the beer holding contest (the beer was in a stein and the arm had to be straight with no leaning back for leverage). In the end, two guys ended up in a tie and each got a free stein as a souvenir. Us girls got a free stein after doing the chicken dance, and that stein went to Isabel because it was her bachelorette party weekend. I hate the chicken dance, but it was worth getting kicked and stepped on to get a free stein. lol.....  Hofbrauhaus is a good place to drink tons of German-crafted beer, sing along with the host, get a spanking after taking shots (not for people with a low threshold for pain), eat delicious food, and do the chicken dance.",

In addition, we ate and drank at the Hoffbrau in Munich.  Based on those qualifications, I wouldn't recommend spending your money here.    Everything is way overpriced, and they aren't embarrassed by it.  The pretzel appetizer was good, and the sausage platter my wife had was good, but my jaeger schnitzel was terrible.  There wasn't any thing schnitzel about it.  It was just a breaded pork cutlet sauced jaeger style.  It's not schnitzel until it is pounded flat.  That cutlet didn't experience hammer blow one.  The beer was excellent.  It was very fresh.  We were fortunate enough to be there for the tapping of the dunkel wheat, which was done by a Vegas performer, and 15 minutes later had a glass at our table.  I had the maibock, which was still very good for this late in the year (June).    The place didn't look anything like Munich and the beer garden looked kind of stupid being indoors.  I understand why it's hard to have an outdoor beer garden in Vegas,  but it just looked ridiculous.  No offense to the people who did the actual work, it was just a bad idea from the start.  Our waitress was very nice and timely, the servers seemed busy and the bus boys were also working hard.  I would go back for a beer, as expensive as even the beer is, if I was in the area, but I wouldn't pay for a cab ride to go there.  Avoid the food, and know you are going to pay considerably more than you want to.",

The location is pretty much spot on to what you'd find in Munich, it's just a slight bit smaller (and virtually everyone speaks English).  The food is pretty good, it's just not something you'll want to go over board if you're watching your cholesterol levels.  I had a chicken with mushroom sauce and spatzel which was pretty tasty.  Our table also had the apple strudel with ice cream.  The beers aren't priced the same as Germany - 1/2 liter was $7.50, a full liter was $13 if I remember correctly.  But go for the full liter - trust me, you can finish it all.  We avoided the shots which came with a complimentary whack of the shot paddle (think of frat house hazing, it's pretty much the same thing).  The entertainment was pretty good and it's a fun place to hang out at for a few hours.  My only complaint is that it was so loud, that you're literally yelling at the people sitting at your table to talk.",

If you want fun & loudness make sure to sit in front, otherwise they have a garden in the back to enjoy the food quietly. If really busy and you don't have reservations they may try to seat you in the garden, if you don't want to miss out on the fun just find a table that isn't full and ask those people if you can sit at their table, worked for us several times!",

    "text": "To be perfectly honest- I thought this was a horrible representation of the German branded beer destination in Munich. I know it's two different countries, but the feeling was just- eh. If you're going to slap the name Hofbrauhaus on a venue to lure people in, at least give a similar experience- especially since you're charging a lot for it. I'm actually surprised that this restaurant got as high of ratings as it did. Maybe I should have started drinking before coming?  The location in Munich was a warm and friendly atmosphere while the Las Vegas felt like an afterthought. We ordered two dinners, a beer, an iced tea and dessert and it came out to a little over $80. Wowza. I kinda felt ripped off. There are a ton of great German places in Orange County/LA that charge significantly less and have a way better vibe. Jaime P and I actually joked that there were more servers than customers, yet everyone had to try and flag someone down for attention.  I ordered the nurnberger rostbratwurst which was three pork sausages, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and the meal was washed down with a mug of the Hofbrau Maibock. The sausages and sauerkraut were cooked okay, but lacked any real flavor. Same went for the mashed potatoes. The beer was good, you can't go wrong with that. I should have ordered more of those and it would have probably still been cheaper in the long run. At least I would have been drunk and satisfied.  Went the extra mile to fill the void in my stomach and ordered the apfelstrudel that came out warm with a side of ice cream. I can't say anything bad about the dish. Between this and the beer, it was the only reason I chose to give this place two stars.  There was a one man band singing some German tunes. He did his best with the crowd in the beer hall to keep them entertained. I think there were seven total in this massive space, but he did what he could to get the audience excited with beer drinking games and off the wall jokes. It was funny because when I called for hours, I was told I should make reservations because it's on a first-come basis. Maybe the other 500-people or so were on their way?  This could have just been an off day- unfortunately, I'll never know an on day because I wont be coming back.",

They seemed to really enjoy what they were doing and made it fun to sing along.  I had a half chicken with potato salad. The chicken was really good... cooked well and enough meat to fill me up. The potato salad wasn't as good, though... it was cold and sort of slimy. Perhaps that's the way the style should be, but I didn't like it.  They have a couple of beers in traditional German styles, and they're very good.  Seating is a bit communal with long benches that can hold multiple parties, which really isn't my thing but for the style of this place, it really does fit.",

Always wanted to get to the Cincinnati location when I was living in Louisville, but never did.  We walked in around 9 p.m.  Early enough that it wasn't crazy, but late enough that the super majority had dos boots of beer and were schammered.  And we tried to catch up!  But those German girls are a lot more woman than me.  After one ginormous beer, I was done!    Great touristy atmosphere.  Very interactive.  Most of the servers were very friendly.  A total drunken, German party -- dancing, singing and drinking.  I can't wait to go back and try the food because nothing says party time like beer and kraut! hehe.",

    "text": "The owners of one of Munich's most famous institutions, the historic Hofbrauhaus, have lovingly recreated it - across from the Hard Rock Hotel - down to the last detail, complete with beers, steins, and brass bands. Stepping through the front door, you leave behind the arid desert air and glitzy casinos of Vegas as you're transported into a world of schnitzel, ale, and strudel, served in a beer hall with ornately painted columns and ceilings, or an indoor garden with chestnut trees and a fountain, by buxom dirndl-clad waitresses with rosy cheeks. Having been to the original, I can attest to the autheniticy of the look, the feel, and the extensive Bavarian menu here. Liver mousse is served with a pretzel baked with dough flown in from the fatherland on a daily basis. If you like sausage, you must indulge in a wurstplatte, overloaded with Viennese franks, chicken and pork links, creamy mashed potatoes, and imported sauerkraut. Pork roast with dark beer sauce and bread dumplings, fried filet of cod with warm German potato salad, and breaded pork cutlet with cranberries are among the other specialties. Three versions of hofbrau - lager, a premium dark wheat, and a seasonal version - are on tap, and German, Australian, and California wines are available by the bottle or glass. Naturally the atmosphere is loud and festive, as if it's Oktoberfest every day of the year. If you're not part of a group, you probably will be before the night is over. As highly recommended as it is totally unexpected for Vegas.",

I fell in love with bratwurst, schnitzel, sauerkraut, potato dumplings, potato pancakes, brotchen etc. Germany also introduced me to anomalies such as mezzo mix (coke with an orangey lemony twist), nutella, eating fries with mayonnaise, room temperature beer, cola weisen (beer mixed with cola) and Birkenstocks. It was an experience indeed. The Hofbrauhaus reminds me of those days. Germany, Vegas style. The food is authentic enough to be called German cuisine. I recommend the different types of wursts or the schnitzel. Quite expensive if you ask me. Warning: when the band is playing in the hall it gets really loud! Make sure to watch your beer intake because the alcohol will sneak up on you.",

The purpose of the visit was to watch the live music and sit at one of the long shared tables just like Germany.  We were told reservation needed for that part (empty seats all over when we walked in) so we were away from the music.   Beer and food WAY overpriced!  8.00 for a 10 ounce beer??  Can't even cough up the extra 2 ounces and fill the glass to the top?   I chose not to eat out of aggrevation but my bf did.  He got some ugly white sausage that came in boiling water and smelled gross with a soft pretzel that appeared to be a rock like texture.   Spare yourself this place. Too many other great places to go in Vegas!  Hit the real one in Munich if you want a great time!  The only good part about this place was the waitress.  She was really nice.",

Hofbra is the perfect combo of goodness. A plentiful bounty of traditional German fare meets vomit-inducing mugs of the finest brew. Leave your inhibitions at the door and strap on those nut-huggin lederhosen, because it's a straight throw down at the Hofrba. Those Germans sure know how to throw a party. Animal style is an understatement. Where else can you don a mammoth pint of the richest sap in one hand and gobble a charred wiener in the other, all whilst doing the chicken dance in a circle? You wanna get paddled by a buxom blonde or cheeky little boy? Hofbra can deliver. You wanna stomp and bang on the table and scream DASSSS BOOOT at the top of your lungs till you cream in your pants? Go ahead!...Cause that's how they do at Hofbra. It's hedonism at it's finest and everyone's playing along. Good fun!  Nuff about the party - let's discuss Hofbra's shining star...THE BEER. Flown miles n miles to get here, the beer is 100% grade A, German syyzurp. It's tapped on the regular so you know that juice is fresh. That juice, that juice...that whirling, seductive betty will set your feet a flurry! She'll whisk you away to a blissfully fuzzy place you can call home. Watching that beer maid clad-in-plaid carrying over those bubbling Steins makes my heart skip a beat. It never gets old. I fell in love with the wench right there. Ohh that foamy dome peeking up at you with those pretty eyes! The food is damn near perfection to boot. They do meats. Big, succulent ones, like schnitzels, stuffed baby chickens and assorted snausages...and those moon sized coarsely salted pretzels! - they're the death of me. Horbrauhaus is that silly old bitch you can't kick. There I said it. I have her on speed dial and when I'm sad and alone, she's the only lady I call. Hofbra, Ich Liebe dich always and forever.",

After wandering around without a concrete idea of where we were going, the Hofbrauhaus finally greeted us as an oasis of German-themed refreshments. We were quickly seated, beered and pretzeled. I got the HB Hef, which was surprisingly memorable, and the pretzel, which the waitress pretty much pushed on us, was actually a highlight of our meal. Aside from these staples, the menu is fairly homogenous: most dishes involve a sausage, mustard, and potato in one form or another.  Though our meal ended up being surprisingly pricey, I would say it was worth it. At least until I get the chance to actually make it to Germany.",

The food also came quickly and it was delicious. Unless I missed something, the only parking available is through valet which is free but be prepared to tip. The service was mediocre. We barely saw our waitress and had a tough time getting a refill on water or even getting the check at times. Even with that said I'd still recommend this place to anyone craving German beer.",

That said I got the Bavarian specialties plate. I'm not a big fan of sauerkraut, but I tried it since it had been awhile, I still don't. If you do however, the plate has a good portion. The potatoes were okay, I've definitely had better. The sauce and meats were where things got amazing, the flavors were great and the meat was very tender. I wish the plate just had a bit more.  Ally (vegan): Vegan options were clearly labeled on the menu which is always nice! I ordered the vegan schnitzel which was made with soy protein, spices and bread crumbs. Personally I think it could've used more spices. However this dish came with a salad that was super flavorful! There were potatoes, cucumbers, cherry tomatoes, and cranberries. If I could've ordered just a big version of this salad, I would have.  We went here for Valentine's Day - they weren't too busy and got us seated quickly. All staff members were really nice. There was live music - two musicians going around each table singing German songs and playing a couple of instruments. The German dining hall decor made for a unique experience!",

If you are feeling super daring and over the top, you can get a nice paddling for $5! Yep, $5 gets you a spanking.   Not a place for children, it's a little rowdy and the paddling isn't appropriate for the littles but definitely an awesome spot for large groups, bachelor parties etc..",

On 01/03/2019, we celebrated a 21st birthday and enjoyed lunch here.  Our birthday diner was not carded for her first alcoholic beverage (large beer) she ordered.  There was plenty of parking and seating during a Thursday afternoon but no live music.  The waitress was friendly and attentive as she constantly came by to check on our table.    I ordered one of the winter lunch specials which was a meatloaf for $12.  This dish came with peas, carrots and mashed potatoes.  The meatloaf was not what expected because it was two thin ground beef cutlets with a mushroom sauce on top.  The meatloaf was a bit bland for me.  Also for an appetizer, we ordered a large salted pretzel with cheese which came to the table warm.  The cheese was thick and taste of the cheese was mediocre.  The Blue Fish bottled riesling was a bit chilled and dry which I like.  There are a wide range of German specialities on the menu.  I would recommend making a reservation for dinner when there is live music and to get the full experience of the German culture and Hofbrauhaus House.",

Quite good and light.   Main course was the Weiner Snitzel accompanied with cranberries and German potato solid.   Very good but not great. Slight taste of oil. Best Snitzel was Vienna Austria.   I would had of preferred the swinenshanxen. (Roasted pork shank) but it is only served on Friday and Saturday's.   Will possibly return   Seating is communal as in all German bier halls.

They have food as well, and I would say that was the one difference between 5 and 4 stars. Most of it was good but and seemingly authentic but salty. Very salty.   Check it out.

Get there in the evening, when everything is happening; ask for a spanking for your husband. You know he deserves it... (Oh, did I mention spankings??)",

However, the plates were delicious either way and the Bier was amazingly the same as Munich. The pretzel were warm with three Bavarian dips that were delicious. Highly recommend for family and the entertainment was funny. This place is reasonably priced for the amount of food and the home plates that resemble Bavarian food.

Within your first 10 minutes here, you'll already witness people getting spanked with a paddle for buying a shot. But I'm really into the music. The musicians played the keys and sang, and some would occasionally walk around playing the accordion or alpine horn (SUPER HUGE horn I thought was just on display). When they played Chicken Dance, everyone joined. When they played Amazing Grace, we stood up and sang along...immediately after, a group of people got into a choir and sang the Canadian national anthem...Wait, WHAT?!  But the food was bad (maybe drink first...because free 10oz with Yelp check-in). 3 of us shared 2 plates: Poached Mncher Weisswrste (2 sausages + pretzel) and Jgerschnitzel (pork cutlet, mushroom sauce, noodle) - and still had leftovers. We had to peel the skin off the poached sausages. I liked the well-seasoned flavor but didn't like that it was way too soft, almost like tofu. The pretzel was entirely bland and had a stale texture, but I liked the honey mustard dipping sauce. I preferred the Jgerschnitzel, but everything in it was too salty to even enjoy.   Given that we're in Vegas, there's plenty of other food to try for dinner...",

Beer was good but nothing special when you can find good beer pretty much anywhere nowadays. Pretzel was a pretzel. A couple of jarred sauces for dipping. No big whoop.   After we finished the waitress came back and was really pushing us to buy gift shop merchandise which I declined. She got all butt hurt like I killed her cat. Sorry, not into pressure from a waitress.   Funny thing is, before we sat down I was looking at the t shirts in the gift shop. I would have probably bought one if the waitress hadn't tried to shove one down my throat.   Sorry Hofbrau. In a world of tourist traps you win the grand prize.",

I enjoyed the atmosphere with a few clients and had a great time here, as he was German and i know and miss the food from growing up. Its hearty, good portions and consistent. Its not the cheapest dinner in town but its certainly one of the most entertaining as there is always something to watch or look at while here. Band on stage cuttin it up to the beer stein holding strength contest that guests participate in. Being outgoing and entertaining is very much encouraged here so dont be shy, order a plate and a pint and make friends with the people sitting at your table.

That was super aggravating!  We ordered the jager schnitzel and it wasn't schnitzel at all but a dried out pork chop that I been Americanized.  German food doesn't come with so many toppings or garnishes and the pork is pounded thin.  It was also cold...and pricey!  We had a reservation for 4, but two were running late.  They only gave us space at a table for two.  The keg tapping for Oktoberfest was also lackluster.  Maybe if you haven't been to Munich you'd find it mildly entertaining. If you have, keep those memories and skip the vegas location.",

German beerhall fashion tables, live music a liter beers.  What more could you possibly want?  There's more.   During our hour or so long visit, (plus a short wait), many, many people were spanked, yes spanked, by the more than willing females servers.  We did not partake, but it was fun to watch.   In addition, the cheerful dancing on benches, live music, and stein holding contests were all exciting, fun happenings to keep us entertained.  We went for the pretzels and sausages and the food was quite good as well.   Prost!",

    "text": "Loud, boisterous, and full of drunken fun!  That's the Hofbrauhaus for ya (sorry guys, I'm not sure how to make the a with the umlauts, but that's what I intended fyi).  Hofbrauhaus is the quintessential rowdy restaurant where you can get some tasty beers and good eats.  I always find myself here in a party-type situation; mostly of the birthday type.  Honestly, the atmosphere fits and doesn't disappoint!  They have a live band playing both American and German folks songs while you get your drink or grub on and it keeps the lively atmosphere going.  As for the beer, they have 1/4, 1/2, and full liter mugs available depending on your thirst level.  IMO the best time to come in and funnel some beer into your gullet is around Oktoberfest.  Their Oktoberfest beer is awesome and highly recommended.  But, in the \"off-season\", the dunkel and hefe do just fine.  I've only had a few dishes here but I usually gravitate toward the veggie options.  They have a few veggie items available including the veggie brautwurst that comes complete with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  I've also tried the chicken braut here and they're similar enough to go either or, really.  The side salad is a healthy sized plate as well so if you're looking for something a little smaller to snack on, the side is a good option.  Also, before I forget, the soft pretzel here is really nice.  It's especially nice when it's fresh out and pieced off with a dab of the cheese or mustard sauce 'shmeared' on.. yummyyy.  Pro tip: alternate sauces when going in on the pretzel... trust me, it's a good time.  Good times, good beers, and pretty good food here at the Hof!  I don't come here often but definitely lookin' toward Oktoberfest for more seasonal German beer goodness.",

    "text": "You really have to be in the mood for this place.  And if you are in the mood, be prepared to face a monster bill.    I've been here 4 times, and every time the main hall has been super noisy.  Partly because of the band and partly because of the general rowdiness.  The beer garden is much more subdued, but kind of defeats the point.    Usually I only come here for going away parties or because out of towners want to celebrate all that is Vegas.  In my experience, the servers really push the large beers and shots, with spankings, which are about $7 a piece.  Let me explain.  A shot girl, or your server if you prefer, will bring you a shot of apple schnapps or Jager on a paddle.  You drink the shot and then they hit you in the ass with the paddle a few times.    It's actually more organized than you would think.  The servers have always been meticulous about how the \"patron\" bends over to take their spanking, arm position, no wallets, etc. So, if the person is drunk, it takes a good five minutes to get them in the right position to get them spanked.  Usually about three spankings are given, but I've seen them do more if they don't think they hit you hard enough.  If everyone is in a fun-loving and/or abusive mood, then the spankings will add up (and the tips given to the spankers) pretty quickly.  Lots of songs, lots of singing, lots of stein holding contests and beer chugging contests.  Things can get ugly fast.  The restrooms are small, which seems incompatible with the excessive alcohol consumption encouraged, but I haven't seen any mishaps either.   Food is ok.  We usually get the giant pretzels with cheese whiz.  Nothing special.   Gratuity is always added onto the bill.  It's pretty obvious on the bill and the servers have always let us know, but that's something to remember in case your party is too drunk to listen or read.  Only go here if you are in a good mood and ready to have a good time.  Poopy pants will ruin it for everyone.",

The rest of the party ordered boots of beer (like in the movie Beerfest).  Oh boy!  I also ordered their Bierkutscher (Beer Truckers) Steak, which was pretty good.  It's a 10 oz Rib Eye (which of course, I ordered medium rare).  However, the sauce on top of the steak was super salty... but my coworkers say that German food in general is pretty salty.

Pretzels were pretty ordinary, but I liked their potato pancakes.  It wasn't greasy and came with apple sauce.  YUM.  Definitely a good place to come to with a bunch of guys to hang out.  It's really entertaining to watch the guys get wacked by paddles from the waitresses (which happens whenever they order a shot).  Woot.  Great memories!",

I ordered Bavarian Liver Mousse & \"Obazda\" (Cheese Specialty) as an appetizer. It was very good. I would recommend ordering an extra pretzel because there is a good amount of liver mousse and Obazda. For dinner I ordered Marjoram (Veal Bratwurst) which was amazing! It comes with a side of red cabbage which was so tasty. For desert I ordered Schwarzwalder Kirschtorte (Black Forest Chocolate Cake). The plate was decorated so beautifully I almost didn't want to ruin it by digging in. The cake was so rich I wish they had milk, but my water worked fine. All in all the food was amazing. The atmosphere is very upbeat and loud. I almost forgot! When you order a shot of Jagermeister your waitress or the Jager girl gets to spank you with a wooden paddle. From the looks on the various guys who I witnessed getting spanked, it seemed to hurt.",

The verdict: it does a great job of offering 2/3 of the party in a much more convenient location.  It's communal seating, and my wife and I were seated next to a quartet of German guys on a road trip throughout the western US.  At one point they went to talk to the Swiss band leader in German for a few minutes, and came back telling us they convinced him to play some conventional Oktoberfest music.  The band struck up a stirring, heavily accented rendition of Sweet Caroline, followed immediately by Take Me Home, Country Roads.  Our table mates lead the sing-along, swinging their liters of beer from side to side.  \"This is exactly what we sing at Oktoberfest!\" they exclaimed.    Also, if you order a shot, the waitress delivers your spirit, then delivers a spirited paddle to your rear... as hard as she can muster.  My wife and I did not try it, but our German table mates partook at least 3 times (each).  They insisted paddling is NOT a German tradition, but is actually an American misperception of how scary and severe Germans are.  (True to this claim, we saw no paddling at the Munich Hofbrauhaus.)  Then the band played The Star Spangled Banner, and the Germans stood on top of the table chanting \"USA! USA! USA!\"  So they were interesting to sit next to, and pretty drunk.  Also the first time I've ever heard the national anthem in a bar.  In terms of food, we tried the cheese spaetzel and chicken bratwurst - both were very good.  The pretzel was just OK -- too hard and not served warm.  I had a radler (beer cut with lemonade) since I wasn't trying to get too drunk -- also just OK, it was cloyingly sweet (I know, it's half lemonade, but an authentic radler has a subtler flavor).",

Granted this is a tourist spot, so the pricing is to be expected. I wouldn't recommend taking your kids here. This is basically the \"German experience\" of drinking and having fun with a little food thrown in. The beer hall smells terrible, like stale beer and sweat. Gross.  Now, on to the more important item. The service was so-so and my waiter tried to cheat me when we paid the bill. If you read nothing else in this review, read this - NEVER leave a cash tip if paying by card at this place! I charged our dinner, but left a cash tip and the waiter chased us down in the parking lot saying that he accidentally charged our card twice. This was a complete lie because while he went back inside with my card, I checked my bank app and it showed the exact amount I signed for on the receipt. He came back out a few minutes later and we went on our way. The next day I checked the bank and noticed the charge from the HB was for a higher amount and NOT the amount I signed for on the receipt. I called the HB and spoke to a very nice young lady in the accounting department who handled this whole mess after the fact. I sent her a copy of my signature and what do you know, it did not match the receipt. Hence, this waiter assumed I was a tourist visiting Las Vegas and not a resident, and he figured he could just steal from me and I wouldn't do anything about it. He took my generous cash tip and then tried to steal more money from me by charging my card for an second tip. It took nearly TWO WEEKS of my calling the HB to get the amount that I was owed refunded to me. This waiter committed fraud and, at the very least, should have been FIRED. That didn't happen. They told me that they've never had problems with him. Yeah, well, just because actual tourists don't complain when they sober up doesn't mean it isn't happening. He tried to steal from me and he'll try to steal from you too.  My overall suggestion is to avoid this place, but if you feel you just have to have the experience, pay with cash only.",

I'm part German, and I can't think of a better way to celebrate that than a visit to Hofbrauhaus.  The food is very rich and filling.  Everything is amazingly tasty, so don't be afraid to order something random off the menu.  The portions are big, but be prepared to be even more full than you think.  This is because you will be drinking at least a liter of dark (or light) German beer.  Every time I've visited Hofbrauhaus, there has been some authentic German beer hall entertainment.  Along with a band, a dude in lederhosen will be cruising around and keeping the party going.  Last time I was there, the band made their way around the restaurant with their instruments, and one of the guys hopped up on a table and played spoons like nobody's business.  If you're so inclined, a girl will come around and offer shots of Jager (or you can order them from your waitress).  The waitress will bring the shots out on a serving board, which doubles as a paddle.  After taking your shot, it's customary to get spanked with the paddle.  Here's a video of my spanking.  Watch out for this waitress..  She hits HARD: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DBAjl_-cnE2s&s=e5374c4a469c04be5788d88a189a90c71eaede7c6a38f47c0c5b89902906b76e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=BAjl...</a>  Hofbrauhaus is a lot of fun, especially when going with a group.  The party atmosphere is also conducive to merging your group with others.  It's not hard to make new friends at Hofbrauhaus.  Everyone is always happy and having a great time!  Ziggi zaggi ziggi zaggi hoi hoi hoi!",

    "text": "For me, the main bonus of staying so off the Strip at the Hard Rock was how close the Hofbrauhaus was.  While living in Germany, this was a main stop for giant beers and plates of schnitzel.  It was nice to relive that experience at the Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas and we even got sat with a boisterous man from Munich at one of the many communal tables.  We didn't get the big beers but I forgot how much I loved the HB Hefeweizen.   The only downside for me was the \"German\" potato salad which was much less German and more backyard American barbecue.  I was really looking forward to it but ended up disappointed.    Despite that one hiccup, we had a good time and after going from one smokey casino to the next, I really appreciated the smoke free environment.",

    "text": "Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas wasn't too bad at all. It was about half a mile away from our hotel so that was convenient. Another great convenience was the fact that they had complimentary valet. Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas is nowhere near as authentic as the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich but it was pretty good. The food servings sizes are outrageous. I had a jagerschnitzel big enough to feed three. We went during Oktoberfest so the pretzels were shipped from Germany and they had the Seasonal Oktoberfest beer. Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas also has tv's throughout the place so you can watch you're favorite sports games. My only issues were the fact that it took over 20 minutes for our group of 5 to be seated and when we were finally seated we could tell that there was a lot of open seats so we shouldn't have had to wait to be seated. Also it gets extremely loud inside so be prepared to shout at the top of your lungs in order to hear the person next to you. Other than that, it was great.",

    "text": "I totally don't care if the Hofbrauhaus is worlds away from being authentic or anything like the real Oktoberfest events that occur in Germany...newsflash, folks...no Oktoberfest or beer garden you've ever been to here is.  I automatically assume that since we're in America, it's going to be cheesy and touristy, and it totally is, right down to being able to order fake lederhosen from the gift shop catalog at your dinner table, but their food is delicious, and being a sucker for yummy German eats, these ones are fine by me.    I'm not sure if the Hofbrauhaus here is expensive because it's in Las Vegas or because it's such a ridiculous tourist destination, but it's a bit pricey.  Good news is, you're getting a ton of meat and for this fat Austrian girl, I'm happy about that.  My absolute favorite, favorite must-have here is the schweinehauxen plate--a whole mallet of roast pig, creamy and fatty to perfection, with vinegary warm potato salad, and red cabbage...oh my yes.  I really have never had anything bad here, but I usually end up getting some sort of plate involving a huge bratwurst, ham, and pork cutlets (most plates being in the $15-$20 range each).  The leibekase is also one of our favorites as is the cold cucumber salad.  Beer is, of course, served in get-you-drunk steins and it is nice that they have rotating seasonal varieties to choose from as well as several flavors of schnapps as your after-dinner apertif True to German custom.    Don't expect to come here and be able to hear yourself think or even have a conversation with your table mates that's above shouting level.  The band is loud and constant, as is yelling and stupid antics by all the drunk douchebags that will inevitably be surrounding you.  Needless to say, it's like going to Oktoberfest inside a restaurant...tons of frat boys who can't hold their beers trying to dance on tables or harrass the waitresses or fighting over who won the stein-holding competition at the end of the evening.  Luckily, the space is huge (yet unfortunately echoey) and there are tons of long, family style tables with benches where you can get away from the stage and the band if you want.  There usually seems to be some sort of conference or wedding or birthday party happening here when we come to eat, especially because it stays open fairly late for dinner hours, but does close at 11 PM.    If you're coming with a big group, you might have to wait for a bit...there is sometimes a line and people usually stay for quite awhile to party.  Luckily, there's a tiny bar in the lobby you can have a drink in while you wait if you want and you can always peruse the gift shop to buy that blue lederhosen you've had your eye on!",

The best part is the food. I have been here for more meals than I should tell you. I have tried almost everything and I have never found anything bad.

The food kind of sucked, some of the worst wurst I've had in my life (and it looked gross too), but forget about that. It's all about the beer... the giant steins of beer... and getting wasted enough to get spanked with a wooden paddle (warning, the more diesel you look, the harder you'll get wacked)...it's about doing the chicken dance (my favorite!) and singing along to classics like Sweet Caroline.

The food was just mediocre and is the main basis of this rating as everything on their Hofbrauhaus Platte (which samples most of the classic Bavarian entrees) was oversalted.",

    "text": "Ok, maybe over excited about this place... so my expectations were pretty high, since this is the ONLY \"German\" place that boast to be like Oktoberfest, but was almost the opposite.  Like Brittany B. said, \"I was expecting such an experience.... I [also] will never return\"  I feel like I HAVE TO go into the whole meal for you to get why this is a 1 star..... so heeeeere-we-go!  We came in 7 people deep looking to get a free beer each (We had coupons from online) so we were prepping for some drunkin debauchery and were excited to get a few liters of beer each... well after we were seated in the hall and ordered our free beer we were serenaded by a pretty good umpapa band so we were feeling pretty good. When our beers came they were little 8 oz beers... I think a can of hofbrau was bigger than this beer; and I know that head is expected but it was half the glass.... ok it's free, what do you expect? Then when we tried it it was flat, like disgustingly flat. So we told the waitress who was surprised and told us that they hadn't had any complaints all day. They then brought over the manager Scott who proceeded to tell us that he's been drinking it all day and it's fine, and that the owner was drinking to and \"he's from Germany\", so our german friend who was with us asked if she could talk to him... Scott then told us that \"He's not here\".... after he left another waitress came over and asked which beers are flat, I pointed to the one in front of me... she picked it up, looked at it, then proceeded to take a swig of it... I told our waitress to pore it out. I later ordered a liter of my own... unbeknownst to me it cost $15... at least $3 more than at Oktoberfest and $7 more than Brats Brothers where I go to in LA.  After that we got our food which was pretty good, but was not as flavourful as I think it is when there's a high turnover rate, cause it was kinda slow so I imagine the less popular items had been sitting for a while, because it didn't taste fresh.   Pluses are we had a friendly waitress Kathy, the Umpapa band was a good trio, but I was upset because they couldn't (note not wouldn't) play it because it was not on their play list, even though they knew it and I was willing to play it. I mean c'mon it was the song to play Oktoberfest 2011, just the Fliegan Song! They also stopped playing at 10:45pm, when the place closed at 11 and the staff were just staring at us the last 15 minutes as to eyeball us as to say (get the F* out we want to go home).... While I remember staying till the waiters were drinking with us after Oktoberfest...   Over all felt really unwanted. Expensive. And not like Oktoberfest.   I'm sure that during Oktoberfest this place is hoping, but what do you do for the other 340 days of the year? Give poor service and expect us to tip 20%?   I won't be visiting again, nor will I be telling anyone to go OR tell anyone it's \"Just like Oktoberfest\"....",

Later she returned to explain that it is because the dumplings that go with the sauerbraten take all day to cook. She offered to replace those dumplings with another side, but my brother stuck with the pork that he had ordered.

We were seated promptly in their dinning/beer hall that looks pretty close to the original, just a bit smaller.  Hearing the live German band playing traditional drinking songs inspired us all to order the Liters of their original beer. I was super glad to read that they follow the German beer laws in this joint too.  In Germany it is against the law to add preservatives or sugar to the beer, which means you can drink all the liters you want and feel great the next morning.   I was a bit disappointed that they were not serving the Pork Knuckle ( pork shoulder on the bone) because I had a hard on for the dish in Munich. Yet, the fact that they do serve it on other nights made me feel OK with it. Obviously I have to come back on my next visit to this crazy city.  After going over the mouthwatering menu a couple times, my eyes locked in on the Schnitzel (spelling?). A fried slab of pork smothered in a fucking awesome brown gravey, mashed potatoes and some veggies. Just enough to fill you up but not to the point of vomiting.  After a few more liters it was time to head back to the strip.  No doubt in my mind I will be back on my next trip for that pork knuckle, and the shirt I was to drunk to remember to buy!",

    "text": "This review maybe a little biased because of how much fun I was having on this night, but I must say, this place is A GREAT TIME!  I had been once before for lunch with my parents when there was no band, no crowds, and hardly any beer drinking.   On Saturday night, my girlfriend and I came here with a friend not knowing what to expect. We were wandering the gift shop waiting to be seated and all we could hear were screams and cheers and loud music and grown men screaming in pain as they are paddle spanked by adult women. WILLINGLY spanked by women with a large paddle. Hysterical.   We were seated at a table right in front of the band where a group of four were already sitting, drinking, and having a great time. Immediately upon our entrance, the band asked everyone to stand up or stand on the tables for the National Anthem. Drunk people swinging their mugs around and shouting out their American pride! Such a funny experience!   We immediately ordered beers and a pretzel. The Hofbrau Original beer was delicious! I am not a huge beer drinker, but this beer was smooth and had a wonderful light taste to it. We must have ordered at least 8 of them throughout the night. When the pretzel came out, it was huge and salty and soft and delicious. The dipping sauces (there were two different mustard and one cheese) tasted great, especially the cheese! It may have been because we were feeling a bit tipsy, but we really enjoyed the pretzel and the three of us ate it up in a hurry.   My girlfriend and I shared the HB Riesenbratwurst, which was a slightly small sausage on a roll with sauerkraut and onion mustard. It tasted delicious! The sausage was a bit smaller than I expected, especially for the price, but the overall flavor combinations were wonderful. Again, this may be attributed to my buzzed taste buds, who knows?   As the night progressed, there were many toasts made and many people brought up to the stage for chugging contests and songs and dances. People watching was the greatest and everyone was really friendly and excited to be there.   Bottom line: it's impossible to not have a good time here on a Friday or Saturday night UNLESS you do not enjoy the following: making friends, loud music, toasts and drinking delicious beer, German horns, and some good old fashioned comradery.",

I haven't been here before because  I'm not real familiar with german/bavarian food..I mean I love their chocolate cake BUT I know nothing else they make  This place is mistakenly believed to be a German establishment but their website & twitter say its a Bavarian/German Hybrid.  What the difference is you'll have to Wikipedia that sh#*.  The meetup was scheduled to be from 11-12 and of course I showed up a little late so I wouldn't be the 1st one BUT not only was I the 1st one.  The restaurant has a gift shop when you enter then a large beer hall with wood tables and benches with arched painted ceilings a stage for the band and all the staff dressed in authentic garb. Ever a Beer Wench:)  The folks from @Urbanspoon were quite gracious and provided a spread of pretzels and sausages to eat. The pretzels has sweet or spicy mustard and a pimento-like spread to dip.  The assortment of brats and sausages was NOT on the menu so we got to try alot of different ones.  The food was good I liked the pretzel & the meat was good but nothing really jumped out at me. Definitely not a fan of Vienna sausage.  Looking at the menu they have more than sausages. Also pork,chicken a few steaks and of course Black Forest Chocolate Cake:)   Prices are under $20 an entree.",

Giant Pretzel $14 (it was not worth $14 maybe $7 or $8), beer's $8 ok,  lemonade $3 and the zinger is you can't get a glass of water with your beer or mixed coctail, you have to pay $3.49 for a bottle of water (that is just lame especially when you are buying a drink).",

The food was OK, not great but worthy of returning.  Cafe Berlin is much better.  One main reason why will be writing this place off: when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  According to Visa's rules this is supposed to be displayed at the entrance and printed on each Receipt.  I didn't notice anything at the entrance and it definitely isn't on the receipt.     So, this *very smart* businessman just lost regular customers, plus us referring Las Vegas visitors here, over about a $5 decision.  Idiot--you'll make that up with just one more beer sale to me.  Good bye.",

The beer was nothing to write home about but I'm partial to a different style.  The endless loud boring live music killed it for me.  No plans to go back.  Fun to watch but no one at our table wanted a welt on their butt to get a shot.  Apparently no \"opt out\" option there.  Parking lot is smallish.  Didn't experience the \"complimentary\" valet.",

Ok the food was good, real good.. The beer was great.. I had another..and by my second one I realized this is the most fun I've had in a while..it was crazy in there, they were nuts! It was loud and so much stuff goin on.. Singing and dancing most I didn't understand yet I was having a great time.. Just wished I had the pretzels before the beers..it was one hell of a time..

It is definitely not a quiet dinner and conversation type of place, so don't come here expecting to really carry on any deep and meaningful conversations. The strength lies in the beer and the experience. The food is really marginal at best and the prices are at about $20 a plate. I probably won't have food when I go back, but will indulge in a liter stein of beer..or four!",

We were sat in the beer garden area, you could not hear the live music at all, it was like going to any other restaurant in Las Vegas for any regular dinner.  We had 2 beers, 2 apple strudels, and 1 pretzel and our bill was $62... which to be honest wouldn't have hurt so bad if we had at least been a little entertained.  I will say this, the strudel was amazing! I just felt very let down by the atmosphere.  I have been to the Hofbrauhaus on other occasions and felt like I was transported to some other place, but tonight extremely under impressed.",

    "text": "Sit down, buy a round of shots, and brace yourself for a great time. If you want to get away from the strip and looking for good food, beer, and entertainment then you need to seek out the Hofbrauhaus.  They serve tasty authentic German food as you would expect, but their beer is why I keep going back.  Their Hefeweizen is still the best beer I've ever had.  I like to order it by the liter, but they do serve it by the pint you lightweights.  Their Hofbrau Original is not bad either and they have seasonal beers too.   After you've had your meal and a couple of beers order your friends a shot of Jagermeister or apple sours(taste like apple juice, but kicks like a mule) and when the drink arrive pull out your camera and record as your friends get spanked.  The waitresses and JagerGirl will paddle you right at your table for all to see.   Once the you've had a few shots you'll be sing along with the polka band and you'll be throwing change from across the hall into the tuba (totally expectable  behavior).   When you get ready to pay make sure you brought enough cash because the prices are on the high side. My party of four was there just about an hour and spent about $200, and that was on a light drinking night.   Yes it's expensive, but I think its well worth the money. You're not just pay for a meal and drinks your paying for an experience and a really good time.",

    "text": "Ok... I will just say this. I am of German descent. I love German grub. I love German culture. I love German beer halls. One of the last three things was not on target here =\\  The guy playing the horns, downing beer, singing, while wearing traditional German leather pants was awesome. He definitely helped to liven up the atmosphere. However what made him even better was that he was having people play quarters for prizes, having contests for free beers (I won one, but was about to drive to LA and thus couldn't drink it) and I am sure he has many other things of a similar nature that I missed since we were there at lunch on a Sunday.  Pro Tip: I know Oktoberfest is going to be awesome here. Bavarian brau haus... ohhh yeah...  The murals, architecture, beer are all authentic. The food is a bit off though to me. I ordered the Oktoberfest Bratenteller. This is a double dish sauerbraten and pork roast. They each had a different gravy. The sauerbraten comes with a dark brown gravy with a slightly sour note due to the vinegar marinade that it left in for a few days. The meat is tenderized due to the marinating process and is done well. However the taste of the gravy seemed off to me. The pork roast was in a traditional German mushroom gravy. The pork was also tender but the taste wasn't on point to me again. It seemed that the gravy again wasn't like I am used to for most German food.  The pork roast mushroom gravy was also a much lighter shade than I am used to. However what had me crushed as that the spatzle wasn't that good. Spatzle is my most favorite part of German food. It is a noodle that when smothered in gravy is phenomenal. However here I felt it was anything but. =\\     Pro Tip #2: Most of the items in the gift shop are a weee bit overpriced ;)   so unless money is no object, I bet you can find that stuff cheaper elsewhere.  Service was kind of funky as well. The fraulein who was serving us, was somewhat inattentive and missed some basic things that the other waitresses did not. The details are what will make or break ya, and she forgot to ask if we wanted straws or lemon in our water when every other table had them delivered that way. She had a preoccupied air and was almost mentally checked out it seemed.   Pro Tip #3: If you sign up for their online newsletter (on their website), you get free beer coupons!  Overall, I would come here for the bier, camaraderie, German culture, drinking songs... Heard the pretzels were good as well, but the grub perhaps would be better on a different day/night or perhaps I ordered the wrong item. I also disliked that we got there during lunch time and didn't receive a lunch menu but a dinner menu =\\",

After spending a bunch of time in Munich and going to that one it is awesome to be able to experience the Hofbrahaus here in the states.  The Bier is amazing just like in Munich.  I especially like the Jumbo Complete (great to share) and the sausages are wonderful.  The environment is so much fun and can get pretty crowded.  It is on the more expensive side so know that when you go you'll be spending a bit of money but I always take that into account.  For the most part have pretty good service but at times have been pretty slow.  But since I love the environment I'm usually ok with it.  Can't wait to be back!",

    "text": "Wow, tough to give it four stars, but I am going to do that. I will explain why. Beer should never be $16 for a draught beer. Sure it is one liter in size, but really who came up with that price? You almost feel obligated to spend it because the smaller beers are $9 so you might as well splurge and get the full Bavarian experience.  So why 4 stars? The food. Let me tell you after spending five years in Germany and knowing what Bavarian food should taste like, it is spot on. Really rich and authentic. I had the Cheese Plate appetizer which had American cheese on it, but don't let that bother you, it was done well and you get the same plate in Bavaria anyway.   The Bratenteller is a mixture of Pork and beef with red cabbage and Spatzle. Authentic in every way and so good every bite was made with some sort of noise like umm, yumm, mmm, etc.   Entertainment is good but in my opinion it should be louder.   You will be seated with total strangers unless you indicate your comfort is not there, but sitting with strangers is the Bavarian way and I met some of the most fantastic people including a family from Ireland.   So money aside, bring a hundred so you can get just a little of everything and at least 2 beers to get the full effect. This is a great place to celebrate someone's birthday or anniversary or whatever. Just make sure you tell your waiter and they may do something special for you.",

I asked the waitress if we can sit somewhere but she kindly rejected. The strangers were guys from Toronto and they were pretty funny and photo bombed us. The food was good, I remember having the famous Bavarian sausage. The price was high though. My friend ordered chicken salad and it was something like $16 she read the menu wrong. There is a section below the entree where it says chicken add this price shrimp add this price . Anyways she thought she could have a better dinner elsewhere. The place is huge with high ceiling. It was very entertaining and loud. A man comes around with big horn and put it on each table and people put money inside and ladies walk around selling shot and the men get paddled. There is German music and every now and then they would cheer and everyone on the table cheered \"Ein Prosit! Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi, Zicke, zacke, zicke, zacke, hoi, hoi, hoi. Prosit.\" LOL! Good times!!",

My gf and I ordered the Meat Salad (awesome bologna salad btw), and the Bratwurst with saurkrat (which was tasty as well).    At first I ordered the half liter beer.  I looked over to my right and saw a tiny blonde girl drinking a HUGE liter mug.  I felt so much like a weaksauce, especially since my gf was taunting me, that I HAD to order the one-liter mug.  There was no choice.  Needless to say, I enjoyed every drop of their Hefeweizen (they use a LOT of bananas and cloves if your into the sweeter hefs).    I'd love to see how they party down here during dinner time.  The host guy was hilarious, going around each table drinking his one liter mug of beer and one liter mug of Bloody mary simultaneously.    Cheers!",

Ordered the \"wurst\" special a carousel of weiners and pretzels. You really can't go wrong with anything that you order. I guarantee a FUN TIME. The performers are excited and the joke mans are very interactive. Employees are dressed everyday for the part. Make it a point to stop in. Definitely, memorable and a LV staple.

We got there as soon as they opened (11am), so we were able to be seated right away. Our server greeted us promptly and took our drink order. She was very nice and took care of us in a timely manner.   When ordering beer, you have the option of a liter or half liter. On tap year round are the original Hofbrau, Dunkel, and Hefe Weizen. The seasonal beers are the Oktoberfest, Maibock, and Hefe Weizen Dunkel. I had a half liter of the Original. It was refeshing, as always.   The food here is definitely authentic German cuisine. And is it delicious! For my meal, I had the Jaeger Schnitzel, which is one of my absolute favorite German dishes. It is a large pork cutlet that is topped with an amazing mushroom sauce, bacon and onions. It is served with a side of spatzle and cranberries. I was not disappointed. The schnitzel was slathered in the mushroom sauce, which is how I like it. My husband had the Riesen Fleischpflanzerl, which is a giant burger made with both beef and pork (Bavarian style). It is served on a kaiser roll with traditional garnish. Cheese can be added. I was able to sample some of the burger, and it was amazing! It reminded me of my mother's meatloaf, to a degree.   I have made an executive decision: future trips to Vegas will definitely include a stop at Hofbrauhaus.",

Went at about 445 on a Monday and there was no wait.  Waiter was very helpful explaining beers and food and specials. We decided to share a plate and a pretzel and he graciously provided an extra place setting for us. Schnitzel was heaven and pretzel with mustard and cheese dipping sauces was gorgeous. Couldn't have been happier, even if the prices are a bit high. Still worth it.  Also, they have a family restroom to make changing the little ones a breeze. Always gonna give points for that.",

For a person longing for a taste of Germany, I was disappointed.  I was even more disappointed when I received the response from the manager.  I have been in all parts of Germany as I was stationed in Europe for six years in the Air Force.  Never would any of them fry their snitzel a in rancid oil, nor would their Hagar sauce be this bland.  Whoever was cooking for you that day didn't have a clue what they were about.

We thought it would be a good idea because we love the one in Germany and we're hoping the food would be similar but we were very wrong.  When we first got there, the hostess was super rude and cranky. That's ok, it's earlier than they're normally open, we get it. Then we sit down and the waiter doesn't even come or acknowledge us for about 10 mins. Finally we order the pretzel, brat sandwich, and a side of the potato salad which I loved in Germany. The food came quickly (which is why 2 instead of one star) but the pretzel was ice cold, not freshly baked. The sandwich didn't come with any condiments and it took ages before we got it, and the potato salad was a very bizarre potato cucumber salad. I took a bite and it was just too off to keep going. She finally came back and I thought they gave me the wrong salad (there were two on the menu; potato salad and potato cucumber salad) but she said there was only one type of salad. I sent it back but she wouldn't take it off the bill. If you're looking for similar food to the one in Germany or good service, you will be disappointed.",

    "text": "As a native German, I have to say that the beer is definitely authentic, and the food is pretty close, but with American touches and overpriced...   I did enjoy a Weizen and it was as it should be, cold but not half frozen like beer seems to be served here.   I had a Wiener Schnitzel and some Potato salad. The Schnitzel was rather big and was served with a lemon, which is good, and some sort of berry concoction, which I have no idea what that was all about... Never seen such a thing, it is not something that goes with a Schnitzel. The potato salad was cold, thank you Lord. This hot potato salad thing is just unnatural.  Then there was the great German Polka Band, absolutely German, you could tell by the accents.   The hostesses, uhm, well if you have nothing nice to say, then keep your mouth shut... so, no comment.  Their idea of communal seating here is that they will bring to you a table they pick out for you. After what criteria remains to be the great  unknown. While the hostesses talk a lot, they don't seem to talk to the guests or answer questions of any kind, oops, I wasn't going to say anything.   Only encountered one German waiter (most of the wait staff is female and American). Nice if you have some folks that actually speak German in a German establishment.   Something really weird is going on here. Apparently folks are happy to bend over the table to receive a whack on the behind with a paddle... Why? What is that all about? I know for sure this is not a typical German thing. Try to have me pay for a meal and then whack me on the behind and there will be a fight... good grief and people are asking for this?   To sum it all up: Food, beer, music, decor, German waiter (very cute btw)... all great  Prices, butt smacking, hostesses... no thank you",

The service was excellent and food was served timely! The best however was the entertainment. They had a duo playing from Germany and Austria. Alpindoc and Mountain Mexx put on a fantastic show with Accordion Guitar, Cowbells, Alpine Horn, wooden spoons. They really went out of their way to play requests for birthdays, anniversaries etc. And sang the national anthem perfectly at 8pm. Thats why we give this place 5+ stars and will come back again on oir next visit to Las Vegas",

    "text": "If you like to get off the Strip for meals, I definitely recommend coming here for lunch or dinner next time you are in Vegas. The interior of the restaurant is very similar to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich AND, even though they don't have an actual outdoor beirgarten, their back room, in typical Vegas style, makes you feel like you are in an outdoor beirgarten.  My only one real complaint about this place was the music. When we came in around 9 pm on a Saturday, non-German rock and roll music was blasting so loud I couldn't hear myself read a menu. This issue was quickly resolved when a kind waitress moved us to the back room, aka the \"outdoor\" beirgarten. Later on in the evening the music switched back to a German duo that played traditional polka music.  As far as German food goes, I think this place does a really good job of coming close to food at the actual HBH in Munich. The sausages (wurste) were all wonderful, as were all of the main dishes that we ordered. The only thing that none of us liked was the rotkohl (red cabbage). It was way too sweet and had cinnamon in it. This is definitely not the way its cooked in Germany and not something I want to eat with a savory meal.  The beers are served in either liter or half liter sizes. We saw some people ordering shots, which come with swats, and that was pretty entertaining to watch. The waitresses really feel free to let out all of their pent up food service industry frustrations, as they smack the drunk guy who ordered the shot HARD with a wooden paddle.",

Conversation with anyone not sitting immediately adjacent to you consists of yelling, shrugging, and smiling in a slightly confused way because you don't know if your table mate said something funny or tragic.  God bless the poor musicians on stage doing the most thankless gig in Vegas. But the music they were playing was not in any way conducive to a German vibe. Painful renditions of \"Margaritaville\" and such just exacerbated the disconnected wierdness of the whole experience. Performed through what must be the worst sound system in town in the boomiest room in North America - well... there was nothing that they could do, really.  Call me crazy, but in this kind of place, I want a barely amplified German polka band. Strolling, perhaps.   The staff - from Greeters to Servers - were fun and friendly. They deserve hazard pay for dealing with the drunken shenanigans that happen in this place.  The food - fine. Simple and filling. This is not the place to come for fine dining. It did indeed remind me of the many meals that I have eaten in the Hofbrauhaus in Munich. So, pretty authentic in that area.  The Beer - also authentic and fine. This is good, standard German beer done well. Nothing to knock your socks off. Nothing Micro-brewery fancy schmancy here. Just traditional brews with a relatively low alcohol content. Perfect if you plan to drink a few liters (and remember that a liter is a WHOLE LOT more than a pint).   After all of that... I admit that I did have a good time - mainly because of the company. Would I go back? Only if I had some out-of-town guests who wanted that experience. I'll just bring earplugs, and get my best smile-and-shrug game on.",

I have to preface my review by stating that I don't eat pork or drink beer - which is their main thing being a German beer establishment. Still, they had several dinner options with chicken, fish, beef, and vegetables for me to choose from.   Food quality: Super duper mediocre. I tried their fish and potato salad, and ate about 30% of my food. Also had a pretzel with cheese dip for an appetizer. Wetzels pretzels or any other mall shop does a way better job!   Atmosphere: This is their main thing- People come here to take shots and get smacked in their butts with wooden paddles and then getting hugged by their waitresses. Most people looked like their butts were hurting, or they were going to be hurting soon from drinking too much. It was totally entertaining to watch.   Service: All the waitresses were super relaxed and still pretty attentive. One of them just took a seat next to a gentleman in my party and watched the hockey game for a few minutes. Just a really chill vibe overall from everyone here. I could see myself being a patron if their food tasted better.",

The hostess was not the friendliest of the bunch, but this alone could not ruin my spirits for this experience here. It was quite empty except a few Beer Hall tables with groups at 3pm. Ordered a traditional OktoberfestBier and their Weisswurste (White Sausages). These are Munchen's famous veal and pork sausages poached and served with a freshly baked pretzel.

The female servers all wear dirndl dresses and the men have on lederhosen.   I thought the food was rather authentic in terms of offerings and taste. It wasn't just sausages like at most local German restaurants I've been to. The dishes reminded me of what I used to be able to get at old The Black Forest restaurant in Santa Monica.  Here, you can order schnitzel, sauerbraten, and schweinebraten. I chose the pork schnitzel which came with real spaetzle and cabbage. It was so yummy. My friend got the sauerbraten and it tasted like what I had in Germany. The meat was so tender and seasoned authentically. We also had pretzel to start and it was also delicious.   A few minutes after sitting down, we heard a loud noise. We thought someone dropped a dish or something. We came to find out that the sound was from the waitress paddling a patron after the patron downed a jaeger. Apparently it's a thing here. That smack was loud. It's something you have to witness for yourself.  There's also a dude who goes around blowing the alphorn. You tip him when he comes to your table.   It was a fun experience.",

The oktoberfest seasonal is great and so is the original! Pretzels are pretty good too especially with the sauce. Beer literally goes down easier than water so I definitely recommend the larger portions.",

    "text": "A small piece of German culture here in Las Vegas, who knew. I attended an event here which was located in one of their halls in the back of the restaurant. This large meeting room was huge and even had tables like that in their main dining hall. The decor was something that would fit right along side a small German village. The staff was extremely sweet and their clothing was a throw back to the bar maid type of dress.  One cannot truly experience a German restaurant without trying the beer. The beer I had was a darker ale and had spicy undertones, but was very smooth. I ordered a sausage dish with sauerkraut and eating them together was so delicious. My favorite was the large pretzel with cheese that was as a big as the dinner plate.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was very loud, but not in a negative way at all. It was small little parties at individual tables that fed in one big huge celebration that a German band was the head of. There was one customer that was even being spanked by the server. So much merriment that one has to raise your glass to congratulate one another again and again.",

Our server was Victoria.  She made you feel welcome and was very patient with us. The party I was with weren't  ready to order main courses until a little later, she completely understood and kept coming back and asking if we needed anything.  The food: I got the veal sausages. I personally didn't enjoy it as much as I thought I would.  It was good, but it wasn't great. The cabbage and mashed potato it came with was delicious though. I am not sure if this kind of entertainment always happens here or if it was just for Oktoberfest but I recommend this place if you want to come in and have a good time with friends.",

    "text": "Leave it to the Americans to ruin things! I've been to the OG Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany. Think of the Vegas location as an overpriced American knock-off. This place is more like a frat house than a restaurant. They've got plenty of entertainment to fit the \"What Happens in Vegas\" theme of the city.   There are no frills at the Munich location - just hard-working Germans who can somehow carry 24 full steins in one hand across a jam-packed hall. I will give credit where credit is due, when you walk into the Vegas location, you do kinda feel like you've been transported to Munich. They've done a decent imitation of the beer hall, complete with plenty of German swag.   As for food, we went family style and shared a bunch of stuff amongst us four dudes. Half chicken with potato salad, pork cutlet in mushroom gravy with spatzle, some sort of beef roast in a ton of gravy, a tower of different sausages (beef, pork, chicken) with various mustard dips, and a big pretzel with a side of mustard. I found the food to be flavorful, but in an artery-clogging way, of course. If I was sober, I would probably find the food to be pretty gross, but after one stein down, your appetite spikes and everything tastes delicious. They really do over-do it on the sauces. The pretzel was also too dry and tasted stale. But overall I enjoyed the meats, potatoes and sauerkraut.   Our main server was good but the Jager lady had a knack for disappearing for long periods. We ordered a round of shots and didn't get them poured for at least 20 minutes.   As for entertainment, there was a \"band\" with two gents playing fun German tunes, a stein-holding competition, and paddle spanking galore. The sound of solid, unforgiving wood demolishing innocent buttcheeks echoes throughout the hall every 60 seconds. It's definitely loud, so don't meet there to discuss business. 21-35 year old males is definitely the key demographic.   HLV is a good time to be had with your bros, but be prepared for a hefty Vegas price tag and one hell of a bloated stomach, when and if you are able to walk out under your own power. It's no Munich Hofbrau, but it has plenty of Vegas appeal.",

I wish I knew about the beer garden because I would very much rather eat dinner there than the main hall.

We always have a good time here, although probably more so when there is a bigger group of musicians (only 2 playing on this recent week night venture). The food nearly becomes secondary here ,as it's more about the overall experience for us. Pretty quite til they start up with the oompah pah pah music. Food just seems to taste better with a few polka styled songs and a couple of German liter drafts (or is it just us).   That being said ~ we began with some cheezey pretzels and capped them off with Wiener Schnitzel along with some Bavarian mustards . Must I also add we partook in some Jager shots, which meant we received the notorious swat with the huge wooden paddle. So our wives informed us that we were \"Seniors gone Wild\" for the night (and yes it does sting!)....",

    "text": "Average but not great.  It was my husband's turn to pick a place for date night and he had heard about HofBrauhaus from some of his co-workers. He decided to check it out for a couple reasons- 1) we both enjoy German food, esp. after living in Italy and travelling to Germany to see my sister-in-law (stationed in Germany) and 2) we're getting ready to move to Germany in a year and wanted a little German tease.   ATMOSHPERE:  I was not surprised by the decor or the costumes since we had been told about the place. Although the description from one of my husband's co-workers was wrong. He described it \"like a restaurant you would go to in Bavaria.\" To us, it was more like a beer tent one would see at an Oktoberfest. Anyway, the atmosphere was pleasant enough but I would not recommend for a date night.   FOOD & DRINK: For a starter, I had the soup of that day, salmon and asparagus soup and my husband had the Potato Soup. Both were really really good and I could have eaten more! Main dishes- I ordered the  Majoram- veal bratwursts with red cabbage and a side of spatzle. The sausages (2) were good but not great. The cabbage was too sweet and the spatzle too bland. The beer was good but I've had better dark beers.  My husband ordered the Munchner Weisswurste- poached white sausages and a pretzel. He enjoyed his dish but again, it was good not great. Drinks- because I wasn't driving, I ordered the Hofbrau Dunkel (small size). It was okay but I've had better dark german beers.   It's a great place if you're going with a group of friends or family. Otherwise, not ideal for a date night unless you enjoy shouting over the live band and sharing a table with strangers.",

There is something to say about good old German Folk music it has a spring to it and makes the drink and food very exciting. They have a great menu featuring traditional German dishes, I strongly recommend the wiener schnitzel dish it doesn't cost to much and you get to taste the different flavors.

Apparently, this is more common as a bachelor party destination SO do not be surprised if you are a group of ladies and you are descended upon by men immediately upon entry. Once we shooed the guys away we got us some huge steins of beer (I had the lager, it was tasty) and sausage and spaetzle and enjoyed watching everyone getting their Jager paddling and the German band playing, it was  fun scene. I the sausage sampler and it was good, some sausages better than others (one just tasted like a hot dog which was weird, the thicker one was the best...that's what she said!) The bride-to-be is a vegetarian and got the German-style mac and cheese spaetzle thing and we all started chowing on that too because it was delicious, maybe better than the sausage! She also had been to the OG Hoffbrauhaus in Munich and yeah, she said this was a little different but we had a good time all the same!",

Order a shot and get spanked with a paddle, good times. The beer, food and service could not have been better. Can't really ask for more- This place rocks!",

They have two large rooms...the first was the Bier Hall with a stage and a live band plus a \"tummler\" who keeps the crowd involved... and long communal tables filled with people screaming & yelling and downing some pretty good German tap beer. There is a second quieter room with private tables that simulates an outside garden but with large screen TV's all around so you can keep track of all the action in the big hall. The food isn't gourmet cuisine but for the price it's pretty good stuff....besides after a liter of dark ale I couldn't taste the difference. They also have a \"shot lady\"who walks around with shots on a tray ...if you order one ...you \"zupp it down\" then she takes out a huge paddle and smacks you on the \"heinie\" and you get to pay for the abuse!!!...Decent food and a very loud fun atmosphere... all in all a good time!!!",

The atmosphere is lively, with live bands and a paddle lady (and yes, you order the right drink you get a paddlin'). The beers are good, and if you choose, HUGE. The food is typical German food, very tasty. The only downside is that it is off the strip, so if you're not staying at the Hard Rock, you'll need a cab to get there.",

The atmosphere was loud, but that is to be expected when the entertainment is never ending. Going on a Monday night I had thought it would be a smaller crowd, but decided to make a reservation. Glad I made a reservation because the place was packed!!!! I started out with one of their white wines and the pretzel appetizer with cheese. Delicious!  At that point I was already feeling full but decided to try out some other things. I ordered some German weiners but it tasted kind of like over-done Oscar Mayer hot dogs honestly....which is why this place did not get 5 stars from me. The potato salad that came with the meal was absolutely amazing! Never had any potato salad taste that great! Needless to say, it was a great experience but I would probably order a schnitzle or something more authentic next time.",

Since she passed away, I've been trying to find a place that could provide me the food I've missed so much.  Thank you to the Hofbrauhaus for doing so. I was like a kid in a candy store.  Actually, I felt like a child at Christmas.  We ordered the platter to share plus bread and potato dumplings.  The potato dumplings were almost as good as my grandma made.  (she sometimes put meat in the center of hers).  The gravy was perfect on top.  The roast beef and pork chop was just the way I love them.  I wasn't a big fan of the sausage, but it was still good.   The live band sang a mix of Bavarian and American songs calling out for social drinks.  The people stood on the tables singing and drinking.  Others danced the polka.  It was just like Christmas.  The only thing that was annoying was the servers' outfits.  Bavarian women do have other outfits where their cleavage doesn't hang out. If you grew up in a family like mine, the food and the music will definitely make you feel at home.  If you are not familiar with this, you might think this restaurant a little goofy.",

I lived in Munich for several years, and yes, while the Hofbrauhaus is very touristy, I still go there and enjoy the food, beer and ambiance. I find the Vegas branch sometimes tries a little too hard to be like the original, but the customers always seem to have a good time, and if I want a bit of peace, I will sit in the bar and eat there.   The beer is absolutely like the beer in German, the pretzels are great and the bratwurst, while not perfect, are still outstanding. My favorite beer is the Hefeweizen, hard to find the real stuff in the USA.  I highly recommend this place to get your fix of Bavaria.",

One, it's a large gathering hall, which echos a lot - if you're looking for a quieter place to eat, this isn't the place.  We were even here for late lunch/early dinner when there weren't many people around, and it was still bothersome.  Second, the food was just ok.  I had the Grillhendl - chicken was good, but a little salty, and the potato salad was pretty sour/tart - most German potato salads are though.  DH had the Jagerschnitzel, which was not that impressed with.  Service was also just ok - our server seemed pretty bored and seemed like he wished he was somewhere else.  Beer was also ok - I've had better German/Munich Beer from another restaurant in town.  Overall, not impressed, and won't be returning.",

It took about 5 minutes to get seated.   Our server was very slow and generally very inattentive.   When we ordered, the server took it upon herself to upsize the items we ordered.   I ordered the small beer (.3L) she rang up the medium beer (.5L).    We ordered a pretzel, she rang up the fancy pretzel with all the sides($5 more expensive).    When my wife ordered a second drink, it literally took 20 minutes.   When the pretzel arrived, it was barely warm, which indicated to me it was probably supposed to be served hot.   We ordered an entree to share after the pretzel, but the waitress just plopped it down and left.  No extra plate or anything to split it up.  Not a huge deal, but why not try to do what you can easily do for your customers to make their meal more enjoyable.  In addition to the poor food quality and very slow service, this place is very expensive.   It is very obvious they thrive on ripping off tourists.  I strongly encourage you to spend your tourist dollars more wisely and just skip this place all together.  I am a regular tourist to Vegas and i know i will never be back.",

I had the priviledge of hosting about 10 folks from Bavaria and Austria and gave them a choice for their Christmas dinner.  When they chose this place I have to admit to being a little concerned, knowing we Americans way of \"Disney-fying\" everything.    They bring their beer over directly from the HB in Munich so it's REAL German beer, not the recipe-altered imports like Becks and Lowenbrau.  Their variety of schnapps (brandy) is a little limited but plenty enough for fun.  The girl who circulates amongst the tables selling shkts of schnapps is fun and includes a whack with her paddle if you're I. to that kind of thing.  The food was good and seemed authentic to my experience actuall eating Germany for several years.  My guests agreed that the food was authentic and as good as you would get in most gasthauses (The Ochsen in Roost just outside Europa Park being a notable exception).  They even complimented the quality of the cuts used for the schnitzels as being above average.  If you're a foodie snob wannabe please move along, we don't need you here.  The German band was fun and kept up a steady replaying of drinking songs that had everyone swaying back and forth on the picnic bench seats.  Buying them a shot is always appreciated as are tips that get you a ring of the bell.  All in all a great place to come with a group for a couple 1 liter beers (just like in Germany!) and some fun.  Good for a casual night out to enjoy German food.",

The high ceilings, communal tables and benches, live German music make this spot ideal for a family out for lunch, or a group of friends looking to get sloshed and spanked on the butt (which they will do when you order a shot of schnapps, oh yeah!)  I've had German food, but not in Germany, so it would be quite difficult for me to review the meal.  It boiled down to personal preferences for me.. I prefer my sauerkraut cold, not warm, and I prefer my schnitzel not to taste too.. \"porky\".  So if you aren't a full-blooded Bavarian chap, I suggest you stick to the sausages and steaks.  The apfelstrudel is really good with extra vanilla ice cream :)    P.S. If you you aren't feeling the communal main dining hall or the beautiful beer garten with blue skies, there's a tiny sports bar by the entrance where you can watch sports and still enjoy the bier.",

When nothing in Vegas is what it appears it's almost certainly not a surprise to find an authentic Bavarian beer hall and garden there. And of course I was sceptical. It does have that familiar Vegas sheen which sanitises everything the eye can see, but was most remarkable for me was that the beer hall smelled right. Literally. Our sense of smell is potent in evoking memories of past events and the beer hall evoked, well, a German beer hall. Oh yes, and the beer is pretty good too!   Park your cynicism at the door. Enjoy.",

Lots of yummy German food on the menu and dare to be different and try something new. I'm not sure what was up with our server though. He took our drink orders and then disappeared for about 20 minutes. We finally were able to track him down to order and get the drinks and he proceeded to disappear again. When the food came out, he was all friendly and checked up on us a couple of times. After we were finished, we couldn't find him again and it took another 20 minutes to get the check and pay.   One of the band members came around to the tables and was playing an alpenhorn (it's the long horn that's in the Ricola commercials); you are able to place money into the horn end. Another selling point for me was when the band played the Chicken Dance. If you're not German or from Pennsylvania, you probably have no idea what it is.

Recommendation to guys: Make sure you try the Jaegermeister / Butt Paddle action: You get a shot of herb-based liquor with a nice spanking from a busty waitress in a Dirndle outfit all in front of everybody.",

    "text": "I lived in Germany for 6 years, and I love my German food. I know the owners put a lot of effort into the place, but I just can't dig it.  Hofbrauhaus Vegas is a great place to celebrate a birthday raucously. The Jaeger girls will gladly spank birthday boys, and the band usually makes the bachelorettes and birthday girls enjoy a special Alpenhorn (the things from the Ricola commercials) concert up close and personal. If you're up for fun and things that are supposed to be slightly embarrassing, this is the place. Just don't expect to have a conversation - the place echoes like the dickens.  The interior is a good replica of the original, but without the spurs of years of smoke and habitation. There walls are a warm color, and there's German-style painting near and on the ceiling. The stage plays host to German bands on the weekends. It's not unusual to see a few German couples dancing the Disco Fox to \"Living Next Door to Alice\" or \"Ein Bett im Kornfeld.\" The band plays a mix of German and English pop, so don't be scared off by a few German titles.  The \"beer garden\" area doesn't echo as much, and it's a much more relaxed atmosphere. It's not actually outside, though, which is slightly disappointing.  Usually, the food is excellent, but at my most recent meal, the red cabbage, my favorite German food, was spicy, as if someone had added Siracha. I couldn't even eat it. Sad panda! The potato pancakes with salmon were excellent, and the salmon was fresh and sushi-quality.  There's valet parking, but most folks usually park across the street at Walgreens. Between the parking, the noise, and now the spicy red cabbage, I'd recommend other places.",

    "text": "Drinking actual Hofbrau Oktoberfestbier imported from Munich in a 1 liter mug accompanied by traditional Bavarian food and music -- now that is the way to have lunch!      The beer was really good.  It was obviously pure and smooth (German laws demand as much), but it also possessed a nice flavor that paired wonderfully with the food.    I started off with the creamy Bavarian potato soup.  Rich and creamy, I was impressed with the natural flavors that commingled so nicely in the soup.  Carrots added sweetness, fresh chives added soul, and the addition of sausage and croutons made it heartier but not overly so.  Great beginning.    For the main course I had the Wurstplatte which was a plate of 4 sausages served over mashed potatoes  and sauerkraut with a side of spicy mustard.  The sauerkraut was served with caraway seeds (Bavarian style) and was very nicely done, full of flavor and not particularly sour.  The Vienna sausages were good, the pork sausage was incredible, and the chicken sausage was just okay.  This dish was noticeably heavy towards the end, but the lighter beer helped considerably.  Nonetheless, I really enjoyed this selection.  The side of pretzel was fresh and tasty as well.  The mustard really made it come alive.  Service was very attentive, and the girl was so pleasant and friendly.  The ambience was great.  Large, open, really cavernous space with picnic table seating and music pouring through the space.  They really captured the beer hall atmosphere of Germany here.    I understand trying to copy the real Hofbrauhaus could be a disastrous undertaking.  400 years of tradition shouldn't be reduced to a marketing gimmick, but I think they did a nice job in the reproduction without sacrificing too much in the way of tradition.  In a world where gastropubs are coming into their own and are even being rewarded Michelin stars, I think places like the Hofbrauhaus will always prove to be a smarter alternative.  Highly recommend this side of Munich.",

    "text": "Mediocre German food. Overpriced. Infexible with the menu sides.  The Hofbrau House tries to recreate a big beer hall atmosphere, so if you just want to get plastered like it's Oktoberfest and don't really care about the food, then it's probably great. However, if you want good German food, look elsewhere. Almost every non sandwhich type meal is $19.99 which is a high for the smallish portion sizes, and the first German restaurant that we have been to where you absolutely cannot swap a small side item to suit your tastes. My girlfriend got some bratwurst, and found the only mustard option was some generic Guldens, no German mustards; she also isn't a fan of saurkraut but couldn't substitute for red cabbage. If the meals were half the price, then I'd understand their inflexible, tight-fisted policy, but we've had much better German food with much better service for less money way too many times to find this place worth ever going back to.",

Depending on who you're with and what kind of party you're looking for.. starting with a \"boot\" might not be the best idea but it is definitely a bonding experience (insert fun drinking game here).    The Hofbrau Dunkel is my favorite beer.. and I like the Jumbo Complete (Giant Pretzel w/ cheese and mustard) to snack on while i pretend I'm German for a few hours.

I thought it was my error when I ordered and waited until I got a menu to look what happened.   I then tried to flag Amber down, it took several tries but she finally came by.  Then when I calmly asked if this was correct, she yelled at me.  Sure it was loud in there, but there was no need to yell.  Again she made no attempt or effort to fix the problem, but instead insisted that that was my order.  She finally relented and I got what I originally wanted.   Then it got better.  She NEVER returned to our table, 2 other waitresses took care of us, as AMBER S. totally ignored us.

    "text": "The \"Hof\" ( we are going to call it that because Hofbrauhaus is way to hard to say and spell) is located in Las Vegas, Nevada across from the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino off from Harmon Avenue. Its a German Ale House with a great Bavarian menu.  The Hof has family style seating which basically means bring your Family or if you don't have a family to bring, prepare to be introduced to a replacement family for your meal. As luck would have it, Simone and I went for lunch around 2:00pm and the place was almost empty so we didn't have to worry about being social with the sin city natives. After much analyzing of the menu we decided to start with the \"Obatzer\" appetizer. Lucky for my waitress she didn't have to worry about my total butchering of the German language as there were numbers that went along with each menu item for ease of translation. The \"Obtazer\" is a hand made warm German pretzel served with a Brie Cheese and Buttered Onion Dip. The dip was rich and creamy and totally went with the pretzel. There was dip left over after the pretzel was gone so the wife and I very elegantly stuck the rest on top of our knives and proceeded to stick it down our throats. Although the choking seemed to be distracting to the other guests we definitely enjoyed our appetizer down to the last knife full. For the entrees Simone ordered the \"Allgaur Kasespatzle\". It was a German style Mac and Cheese made with mini German Spaetzle dumplings, Swiss, Brie, and again, those luscious buttered onions. It was creamy and rich with just the right amount of onion flavor. Although Simone could not finish it, due to the earlier appetizer gluttony, i gladly helped her out. For my own entree i choose the \"Nurnberger Rostbratwurst\". The dish consisted of 3 grilled Bratwurst resting on a bed of fresh sauerkraut and mashed potatoes with a beer gravy. The flavors went together perfectly and complimented each other well. The Potatoes were creamy with a hint of Garlic , the brats were seasoned perfectly, and the sauerkraut was just sour enough but didn't overpower the dish. I completely cleaned the plate and also finished off my side of fluffy spaetzle drizzled in butter and parsley.  My only regret about this meal is I had no more room in the stomach for German beer or dessert. I will definitely try some when I come back during my next Vegas Visit. This was excellent food in a great and fun setting off from the Vegas Strip.",

This place is as good as Oktoberfest Munich.

Inside the main dining hall is the classic picnic table setup for a communal dining experience.  I was there during the day and it was kinda slow so I decided to grab a seat at the bar.  I got a medium sized house beer which is imported daily from Germany.  It was ok.  Nothing above average.  Also grabbed a pretzel hoping for something semi-authentic.  Instead they brought something out nary 2 minutes later that was cold and hard.  At least warm it up!  I know it's only a pretzel but substandard service will not win a repeat customer.  I can only hope this place is a little more interesting come Oktoberfest.",

Seating is unique in it is literally a beer hall and you sit on really hard benches that line the hall.

    "text": "BEWARE! If you have a larger party (we had 15 guys) you do not need to make a preorder of food, even though they will tell you that you do. They tricked us in to preordering way too much food and making us prepay for it knowing very well how much that we actually would need was way less. They tried to tie their reasoning  to a cost per head instead of the actual amount of food. When we cancelled the last two pieces of the order ($200+) before it were cooked or prepared, they would not credit any of the prepay charge back...not even half. They kept referring to the \"contract.\" Which is ridiculous. It feels like we were duped in to a time share or pyramid scheme that we couldn't get out of. It isn't the money at this point yet the principal that they wouldn't meet us in the middle after leading us to preorder and prepay for way too much food. I will never go back and when it comes up in conversation will encourage everyone that I talk to avoid/pass on Hofbrau House.",

We had a large group of people, but when the server came to our table they told the first person ordering that if we did a family style order, it would be the cheapest with the most variety. He agreed, and without letting any of the other 20 people know, half of whom had already eaten, know what was happening, they put the order in. It turns out the food is about twice as much per person ordering this way, and because half went hungry it ended up being 70 per person, before even adding the cost of beer. I'm certain the servers didn't want to take that many individual orders, so they just did it like this, without letting anyone else know in case the rest of us disagreed.",

Upon walking in on a Sunday afternoon, we were greeted by MC Johann and fellow patrons participating in the Masskrugstemmen competition. After that was over, we engaged in singing some German songs about beer and listened to Johann play the alphorn. Great entertainment and an overall great time!  Now onto the food. We ordered the giant pretzel imported directly from Bavaria with cheese/mustard. It was so tasty especially with the condiments! I had a glass of the original Hofbrauhaus beer which was also top notch. If you're in Vegas and have a passion for beer or German culture (or even just a good time!), stop by at Hofbrauhaus LV!",

The Vegas location does an amazing job of staying True to the experience. You eat at large tables, often with others at your table, the staff is dressed in traditional German lederhosen and dirndl, they have enourmous traditional pretzels, and you still get the HUGE liter beers! The food was very good and it was awesome to hear the traditional German band belt out drinking songs as tables chimed in and danced.

Don't get me wrong.  I love latinas, but they lost that \"look\" they were going for back when they opened.  Also, the hostesses don't care about service and just want to seat you at a table with others sitting across from you.  Now, I understand the concept of communal eating at beer gardens.  I've been to plenty, but when it's empty and there's only 2 people at a table, do I really have to sit right across from them?  Apparently, yes.  I tried sitting with an unobstructed view of the band and was told to scoot down.  Why?  Because of the hoards of customers that would eventually flock to this destination.  Never happened.",

I was the first to arrive, and the hostess said to let her know when we had 10 there, and she'd seat us.  When 10 arrived, I let her know.  They started to lead us to our seats, in the Main Hall as we'd requested.  Then, confusion strikes.  She leads us to a table with people already sitting at it, one of our group says \"uh...we don't know them...\" and she laughs, then realizes he wasn't joking, and says \"really?  no way!\"  They claimed that this other group came in and said they were us, so they gave them our table.  However, I suspect the True story is that they screwed up and gave another party our table, under no fault of the people sitting at the other table.  My proof?  While we were waiting for our 10 to arrive, I heard them call \"Leslie, party of 6.\"  We were Leslie, party of 20.  So, the Leslie party of 6 was seated, then they realized they screwed up and tried to blame them for wrongly taking our seats.  Not cool.  The manager was involved in all of this, and he is the sole person to blame for the mistake, and the failure to fix the mistake.  They sent us back to the lobby and made us wait until a table for 20 was open.  By the time we were seated, it was 45 minutes past our reservation time.  We had just played 3 soccer games before going to dinner, and were all more than starving, and grumpy.  It truly sucked.  He tried telling us that we could just sit in the beer garden if we wanted - anyone who has been here knows that would be lame.  There is no entertainment, and it is not fun like the main hall is.  We came there to party, not have a conversation.  What they should have done:  Admitted it was their mistake, not blame some other customers.  Given us free mini-beers while we waited, or at least offered us water or SOMETHING.  Apologized.  The manager here sucks, I won't be back.  Oh, and our server sucked and was rude to some of the people in our group, but we still had to pay the 18% tip they tacked on.  I hate that rule with a passion you would not believe.",

    "text": "Good food, very good beer, fun atmosphere.  Then why two stars?  The value ruins it.  They want your money and have created lots of ways to charge for it.  This place provides a fun party atmosphere where you can partake in fun German traditions and some new ones this place created, all put to loud German folk music.  If you are not much of a drunk partier, it might be over the top for you.  I don't really want to get spanked, sing songs with drunk people, try to hold up an oversized beer mugs until they drop, etc.  If you do, you will enjoy this place!  I've traveled all over Germany and this place mimics the fun beer halls of Bavaria.  I say mimic because it is fairly authentic but still a reproduction of the True festivals of Deutschland.  The food is very similar to that found in Germany but not quite as freshly prepared.  The flavors are good and most cater to the True meat eaters.  Almost all sausages and cutlets are worth trying.  But let's talk about the value.  A pint of beer costs $8 and their terrible Ice Tea almost as much (Germans don't know Iced Tea).  $20 for an entree, $6 for a salad, $1.50 for a slice of swiss cheese on the schnitzel, $2 for bread, and a whole host of other charges.  Basic food and beverages for 3 people was $78 before the tip.  Then there are all the tips.  Tip the waitress, tip the musicians (they even come around begging with their horns), tip the bathroom attendant that hands you a towell but can't keep the bathroom clean...geez, good thing I didn't valet!  You would never find this kind of pandering in Germany!  (Well, you do need to tip the bathroom attendants in Germany but at least they keep the bathrooms spotless during non-festival times.)  So, while there are good elements to this place, I don't recommend it.  If you are interested in an authentic German meal in a quieter setting, I recommend Cafe Old Heidelberg, with very authentic food (albeit, slow service) for a much better price.  Tchuss!",

She wanted us to seat and share the table with other people. Since the huge front of the restaurant was practically empty. I asked her if could seat there. She says she had to ask... While we waited, again, my father starting feeling weak and tried to seat for a minute. Quickly a waitress came and before he could seat, told us that we could not seat down. She had an attitude and my father is 87 years old!!!! I didn't want to argue!!! So we waited until finally the sat us down! The waitress we got want that bad. The food was ok but I expected a lot more from the place!  I think is over priced! I've had much better breaded chicken in other restaurants and my father wanted the Veal and not the Pork Winnershnitzel but they don't make it here.  I WILL NEVER GO BACK AGAIN!!! I don't recommend this place unless you understand the German culture! It's not a pace to have a relaxed meal.  I do not recommend this place!",

I know this is Vegas and drinks are usually not cheap. But this place was very expensive! Which is the main reason why I really wanted to give this place 2 stars. BUT...this place had great qualities that bumped it to 3 stars instead.   First great quality was our waitress. She was very friendly and attentive. The food was also very tasty..and the portions are pretty big. The main drawback were the prices though.   We had to share the meals because we knew we weren't going to be able to drink and eat without going broke. We got the Hofbrauhaus Plate, which consisted of Smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage with dark beer sauce, side of sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.   The smoked pork loin was my favorite. I loved how tender and delicious it was when you took a bite of it and combine it with the sauerkraut and potatoes. Yummers!   The Grillhendl was also ordered. Which is an Oktoberfest style Roasted Half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions served crispy brown with homemade Bavarian potato salad. The chicken was really good! I mean really good people...order this! The chicken was moist and very well seasoned. I wish they would change the potato salad to mashed potatoes instead because they would go better with the chicken. But I really liked this plate...would have been nice to have enjoyed it on my own instead of sharing it :(   The atmosphere of the place was fun. The bad is very entertaining and of course the people getting spanked is a riot.   So in my future visits to Vegas I'm going to have to go gamble, hopefully be lucky and make some money then hit Hofbrauhaus cause it's expensive.",

I was really wanting a Pretzel but ended up eating a afternoon lunch. As usual the Pretzel does not disappoint it come with several side to smear on the yeasty hot pretzel. We ordered a beer and enjoyed the snack. I also ordered a Sauerbraten which is a German pot roast  the meat has been marinated ( soured) then slow cooked it was also served with Spetzel which is basically a noodle forced through a funnel cut into very short pieces and often served with a gravy or just buttered. The other half had Schnitzel which consider it a German style chicken fried steak also served was the purple hot sauerkraut which has a sweetness along with the tang of the acids in the vinegar. Our server was very nice and no pressure. We have always gone on irregular hours so to be honest I can never say how a dinner or busy time is. This has been my go to place every time Im in Vegas for over 10 years. They did not disappoint and I will be back",

We went on a Wedneday evening and it was busy but not overly crowded.  This place is huge including the dining hall and another room where the bier garten is. This room was really pretty where you can have a private party of just sit around and enjoy some hearty brews with friends and family. They have a life-size version of Jenga to play and a beer pong table for those that are looking to get hammered!  We were greeted warmly by the hostess who seated us at a loooong wooden table, room enough for 16 people comfortably. Our server, darn forgot her name but super sweet and friendly provided us with menus and took our drink order.  She brought us out our drinks which consisted of a 1.0 liter stein of Dunkel and a tasty Hefeweizen. Mom had a glass of her favorite Moscato. We started out with a warm pretzel just perfectly baked served with hot mustard, sweet mustard and this amazing garlic cheese. The pretzel was so yummy. They feature live music going on every night and they definitely encourage participation. The performed a rendition of Edelweiss on german bells, this wasn't easy for this guy but his performance was terrific!   Hubby ordered the Sauerbraten - marinated pot roast  served \"bavarian style\" with red wine sauce, veggie strips, homemade spatzle and red cabbage. This meal went perfect with his Dunkel beer. I enjoyed the Grillhendl - Oktoberfest style roasted half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions, served with Bavarian potato salad. This chicken was so moist and I could taste the beer butter. Mom ordered the Gegrillte Hahnchenbrust - Grilled chicken breast with a creamy mushroom sauce and homemade spatzle garnished with crispy fried onions. Our daughter, trying to go vegan ordered Gegrillte Veganische Frankfurter - two grilled vegan frankfurters served with french fries and curry sauce. Everyone was extremely satisfied with their meals. They were all served hot out of the kitchen and with a smile.  Next came the big surprise, since it was hubby's birthday I ordered him a Take a Shot, Get a Swat. He wasn't overly excited about this, but I thought it would add some pizazz to his birthday. Yeah, pizazz and Pain! The busty server came over looking ready and able. Hubby bent over and she paddled him good.  Thank goodness for the Jagermeister shot! Little did I know, that paddling stung! Sorry hon! All in fun. The band played on and we Chicken danced our way out the door feeling full and happy! Prost to a fabulous time had by all! We shall return!",

There was singing, dancing, spanking, shots,  yelling, screaming, Neil Diamond singalongs, and the Pledge of Allegiance... all in community style seating and LOUD. It was basically a mini Oktoberfest and I loved it. Went with a Chinese friend and black friend and their experience was a kittle different than my drunk Irish ass. I'm used to drinking and partying with this sirt if crowd but my Chinese buddy complained about his damn Asian genes and had to give me half his liter of beer when he started getting too flushed, and my black friend wasn't comfortable the entire time. Something about being the only black guy surrounded by a bunch of loud drunk white folk. I told hin he had nothing to worry about as these are happy drunk loud white folk hahaha   Either way, he wasn't too happy with the experience but at least it was an experience.   The food was good and the service was ok.  If you love Oktoberfest,  then you'll dig this spot.  Not sure how it is on weeknights but Saturday was awesome",

The food was delicious, we got the giant Bavarian pretzel to start, which was what originally brought us in.  They had a game area set up with giant Jenga, Connect Four and Beer Pong.  Herbert was our server, he was friendly, funny and attentive.  Next time we will leave room for desserts",

Great selection of dishes except for lack of pork knuckle (Haxen) on the menu during week nights (I was informed that they only serve that on Saturdays) and chicken Schnitzel (not terribly authentic I know, but a few people in our party preferred that).  Ambiance: Very nice.  A bit noisy, but we were there to have fun, and noise comes with beer and fun!  Experience:  It was fun - saw a lot of guys get slapped on their back side with wooden paddles ... the servers that were doing it were not showing any mercy!  The music was a bit weird:  American music performed by what looked like a German band in German style ... I didn't get that!    Service:  Helpful servers.  She answered all our questions nicely.  Food was served on time.  Food:  Pretty good but I guess it could have been better.  I had their pork in hunter style (a thick sauce with mushrooms) with Spaetzle.    Credit Card:  Why do they want to charge a fee of 3% if you use a credit card?  Why can't they pay around 2% credit card fee like every other restaurant?  Is this a way to push you to pay your bill in cash?  This didn't make sense, and it was not convenient at all.",

The German style food is delicious. Start with the potato soup. Try the pretzel, comes with a cheese dip and two styles of mustard. None better! Last night I had the pork platter (I forget the entrees actual German name). Comes with a smoked pork chop, a pork roast, a German sausage, sauerkraut and mash potatoes. So very good. Best of all is the famous Hofbrauhaus beer. I had a couple liters. There is always a German band playing at night. Makes for a fun and entertaining evening. Talented musicians from Germany. Euopean style seating, so when the place starts filling up with diners, you will have others seated at your large table. Again, makes for a fun-filled evening.",

Nobody could hear a word of what anybody else was saying - the live band in the main hall is a nice feature, but yelling into each other's ears all night was just a pain.   The menu is designed like a newsletter, and items had German names (as this is a German beer hall) with the description of each dish below it. Prices are fair - around $20 per entree. I ordered the sausage platter, and it was disappointing. The sausages weren't warm enough, and the chicken bratwurst was just gross.. My friend's steak came well done, and was smothered in salt and pepper.   When you order Jager shots, the theme here is to get smacked in the ass with a wooden paddle by one of the waitresses. This would be going on all night - men in drunken stupor groping the servers and spilling beer... the whole shazzam.   This place is not my scene at all - the food was terrible and the service wasn't great though kudos to our server for being able to hear our order through all that noise.   With the many restaurant choices in Vegas, I'd say save your ear drums and taste buds by staying away.",

Now having gone a second time we did not experience that at all.  When you first walk into Hofbrauhaus it feels like you have been transported to a beer hall somewhere in Germany or that region. I haven't been to that part of the world but people that have told me it does so I have to say they did a good job on the decoration of the place. Even the employees dress up. They have live music and the tables are more communal with a long bench so you never know who you will end up striking conversation with.  The food is great. I had their platter called Hofbrauhaus Platte. Basically a big plate with different stuff on it. It had Smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage, dark beer sauce, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. Everything was flavorful and tender. I had the seasonal Hofbrau Hefe Weizen Dunkel or a dark wheat beer. It was good though I prefer their Hofbrau Hefe Weizen which is a light wheat beer.  The shots you can do also gets you a spanking! haha  The prices may seem high but for what this place provides which is excellent entertainment and an experience plus great food it is worth going to. I wouldn't go here every day but for special occasions like bachelor parties or birthdays it's worth it.",

I often wonder if they have places like this in Germany for americans.",

I liked the big giant hall and getting seated at a table with other people. And the live music was awesome and fun. 4 stars.  We were seated promptly. But then waited over 20 minutes and still not a single server had even glanced at us. Finally, one of the people sitting at the same table as us went to find the server they had (who had just closed them out because her shift was over) and she then came and took our order. She then even delivered our beers. No clue what had happened to the assigned server. When the assigned server did show, there was no apology, no \"I'll cover this round of drinks\", no nothing. Not the type of service one is accustomed to in Vegas. 1 star.  When weren't super hungry, so we just ordered the pretzel. It was a giant pretzel and came with two mustards and the special cheese dip. It was way over-cooked and not tasty. 2 stars.  The beers were decent. There were 3 options, plus the seasonal. They don't offer samples. 3.5 stars.  Meh. It's basically a tourist trap. I hope the actual food is good. Everything seems overpriced. They're big on pushing the gift shop items. Not sure if I'll return.",

The prices are reasonable and you get a generous amount too!   Throughout your meal there is a live performance and it is interactive and very lively. Expect to sit with random people if you have a small party. The waitresses  are fantastic and really add some spunk to your visit if you're bold enough for the paddle.   Honestly, I think two people can share a plate and make it to dessert too! Their schnitzel is fantastic and the fries extra crispy.   By the way, if you make it to dessert try the icecream with the warm raspberries. It was the highlight of my evening.  The vanilla icecream  was nicely paired with tarty, warm raspberries  that almost resembled a marmalade. It was sweetness for my soul! If you like the mix between hot and hold and tarty fruit definitely check this dessert out!",

    "text": "The best advice I could give you about visiting the Hofbrauhaus is to eat before you get here. Don't just rely on getting food here, unless you like paying for a sampler of sausages that look more like Vienna wieners than sausages. Carb up at home or if you are in a pinch, stick with the Bavarian pretzel. You'll thank me tomorrow morning.  Hofbrahaus though isn't really so much about the food as it is where you take your friends when you want to be loud and drunk and it be acceptable. The steins of beers are massive. No matter what kind you get, those one liter steins are going to kick your ass. It's not a shock, I always have a hangover the day following a Hofbrahaus visit. Even if you tell yourself that you'll only have one (or two) steins, you'll get sucked into drinking more. That'll come either through a chugging contest or a spank shot. Who can resist taking a shot and getting spanked? No man I know.   I can't imagine coming here by myself, lest I want to stumble home drunk and hungry. Friends really do make come together. You want to share the experience of hearing a guy blow the Ricolla horn or singing the ziggy zaggy song. You're not getting that at Applebee's, no danke shun.   If you really want to experience this, come during the month of October. And better yet, bring a bunch of your friends. And even better better yet, bring a bunch of them in October and get them drunk and see what happens. That's the type of fun the Hofrbrahaus brings.",

Perfect for your \"Yeah Dude/Yeah Bro\" comments every three seconds, followed by some sort of handshake/pound.   The food was excellent. Service was excellent. Beer was a tad on the warm side, but I'm not one to be picky. Very much like the one in Munich.  I would say the only deterrent here would be the noise. Other than that, definitely go if you're in Vegas if you like German dishes.",

There were several around us and the kids enjoyed watching adults get whacked! The beer was yummy and I am not an beer drinker. The hefeweizen was so smooth. U can get it in a collectible shoe but we opted not to although cute. I ordered the schnitzel (there were several variations) mine was breaded with mushroom sauce & some interesting pasta. Pasta was meh. Schnitzel was yummy & crisp. (Bird Hunter) I had sauce on the side. My husband ordered a sausage plate (smokehouse) lthat he enjoyed although the potato salad not so much. My son got the kids hamburger which is a pork/beef mix & he liked it. Very great slider portion with crispy fries. We also got a side of cauliflower augratin. Overall the food was pretty good, worth trying of hungry. Generous portions.",

If you want to stand on the chair to sing along with your favorite German song go right ahead.  It serves authentic German food obviously.  You can't go wrong with anything.  Schnitzel, sausage, roast chicken take your pick.  Just keep washing it all down with more beer.",

    "text": "Looking back, I realize I was trying to do the impossible. I went here  hoping that it would be a genuine replica of that famous Bavarian brewery that first introduced me to beer. I went here with visions of pork shoulder, giant soft pretzles, and, of course, liters of delicious beer.  I guess one out of three ain't bad.  This Hofbrauhaus isn't much to look at outside, but once you step in the dining hall, you realize very quickly what you're getting into. The setup is very True to the original: high celings, an oompah band, and short skirted waitresses. Slowly, however, things started seeping in. The closest thing that the band came to a genuine German song was the 'chicken dance'. I looked all around for those big pretzles that compliment their beer so much, only to find out that the pretzle that comes with your meal is of the small, hard variety.  I was very dissapointed at the size of the portions, too. My girlfriend got a sausage entree & it came with a minimum of sides: a pretzle. We had to share my plate, the 'Schweinebraten'.  The food was good, but I really expected more. Aren't German dishes supposed to fill you up?  I was very satisfied with the beer, though. It tasted like it did three years ago, and they stick to the original or dunkel. When it comes to beer, you don't come here for variety, you come for quality.  Also, it was really loud, so don't come here expecting a nice, quiet dinner with your sweetheart.  To recap: The food was good, but a ripoff, the beer was great, & the atmosphere mediocre at best. I know I set the bar high, but even with that factored in it wasn't that great of an experience. Would I come back? Only if someone else is paying.",

My friends band was playing in Vegas, so there was a big group of us out there. We went to Haufbrauhaus on a Saturday night... it was so much fun.   Not sure if the large group contributed to that fun....   But basically its like an iconic German drinking hall, long table benches, GOOD beer, a German band, German food, and lots of smiling faces, and swinging beers from side to side. People go here to get drunk, and its a happy fun drunk time. the place almost exploded when the 20-30 piece band entered the building.. waving what i'm guessing is a Bavarian flag...   Anyways, if your with a big group of people in vegas, go here!!!!! Its a really good time!!!!!",

Step inside the Hofbrauhaus, and you temporary leave Vegas.     This past Saturday,after 7 years in Vegas, l finally experienced the Hofbrauhaus. It is so different from what I expected. I expected a mega bar serving hundreds of varieties of beer. In reality the Hofbrauhaus is a replica of a Bavarian Beer Hall. Beer drinkers share good times at long tables. In the front of the Beer Hall, a Bavarian band leads the good times. On a loudness scale of 1 to 5, it reaches a 4. The servers dress in Bavarian uniforms. A major reason, I give Hofbrauhaus four stars is because the well-done theme makes it a unique place to share good times over beer.     Because Hofbrauhaus is a beer drinker's theme park, the prices are inflated. The feeling of drinking beer in a Bavarian Beer Hall justifies $8.95 for a 17 ounce Octoberfest beer from Munich Germany. $8.95 also pays for a strong beer. By the way, a 34 ounce Octoberfest beer is $15.95.     Hofbrauhaus is more than beer. They serve German food at prices that compare to their beer, which is $$$. From Monday to Friday between 11 to 4, they offer $9.95 specials on German food.     I left the Hofbrauhaus with the impression that it is cool to have a beer in a beer drinker's theme park at the same time that one beer is the limit. After one beer, the noise becomes annoying and it is so obvious you could go across the street and have a few more beers at Firkins On Paradise for the price of one beer at the Hofbrauhaus. And this is where we went after having experienced drinking a beer in the Hofbrauhaus.  Review in a nutshell:  Pros: Entertaining Bavarian Beer Hall theme, strong beer, fun at first, plenty of parking at the nearby Hard Rock  Cons: High priced, very loud environment.",

Years ago I read about monk brewed beer and frische schweins hax'n (crispy pork shank) and have wanted to hop on a plan to try it. Luckily, Hofbrauhaus serves it on Fridays and Saturdays so now I can plan that trip to Munich later. Since there were three of us we signed into yelp and checked in. After we checked in we each got a free 10oz beer of our choice said we tried the Original, the Dunkel and the hefeweizen. My favorite was the dunkel so I ordered a liter of that. We shared the large pretzel which was really good. Soft in the middle and good texture on the out side. It has s served with two types of mustard and a cheese dipping sauce. For the main course I ordered the fried pork shank and I have to say, it didn't disappoint. The flavor was great. It was a combination of moist tender meat and crunchy bacon. This was a fun place to go to and I look forward to eating here again.",

    "text": "To understand the True value of the Hofbrauhaus you have to go at least once to Munich, and then you have the ability to compare to this one. This replica does a good job of giving those a German experience who do not or cannot go all the way to Germany for the real thing. They spent a lot of money inside to cave the ceiling similar to the one in Germany, the music is mostly German bands who have been contracted and play authentic German music, and the beer has been imported from Germany as well. The beer is very good, however some people judge because it is not made in house, but that would also require a brewery so it is understandable.  The food also seems to be mostly imported from Germany, like specific sausages and the sauerkraut. My favorite are the Nuremberger sausages with mashed potatoes and the  obatzter cheese appetizer. Both super German and excellent dishes. I also know a lot of people who ordered the Wurstplatte, a variety of German sausages on one plate. Great for big meat eaters and hungry patrons.   As for the ambiance, think loud, group style seating, would not suggest this for a date place or quiet night out. This is a girls/guys group night out, bachelor party type loud and craziness can sometimes go on here. Tons of tourists come here  as well, and they are usually young people wanting to drink and get spanked or old Germans trying out their known cuisine.   Don't go to this place for the service or food, it is all about the ambiance here. Sitting next to and conversing with strangers from wherever, drinking real German beer, and listening to a German band play super loud music echoing in the beer hall. If you want to check it out but are afraid to sit in the big open loud hall you can always retreat to the beer garden which is enclosed in the back part of the Hofbrauhouse and is usually quieter. During busy times they will seat you there and you can get full service as well.  I would recommend reservations if bringing anymore then 2-3 people with you as night time (especially during Oktoberfest or other holiday times) as it can be packed with a long wait. Monday nights are usually the slowest and day time lunch you never really have to wait to be seated so you can also try a quieter lunch still getting the experience.",

    "text": "Decent-enough German food, gigantic beer steins, live traditional music, and public humiliation. They seem to pride themselves on not being a tourist destination, but let's get real: very few people come here more than once for anything but the novelty.  Considering half of Texas, where I'm from, was settled by Germans, the food here did not live up to my expectations given the price point- but we have few restaurants turning out this cuisine here, so some inflation is to be expected. $60 dinner for two, splitting a plate, an app, and a beer? Not really worth it, IMO. Quality was just not there for the majority of the items.  Kartoffelpuffer - Two crisp and golden brown Potato Pancakes served with smoked Salmon and traditional garnish; it's like going to a Jewish deli for breakfast and being torn between the pancakes and the lox, and deciding to combine them. Not bad, but pancakes aren't seasoned at all.  $15  Special Plate of the Day- pork loin served with two kinds of sausage, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes, sided with gravy and mustard. Sausages weren't bad, one was considerably better than the other. Pork was unremarkable, as were the 'kraut and 'taters. $20  The beer. Good lord, I have no idea which beer my guy opted for, but we got the 36oz stein and it was huge but we drank it all without problem because it was light, smooth, and delicious. Complemented the sausages, as it's supposed to. HB prides itself on only importing beers that meet the traditional purity law, with simple, classic ingredients only. Mad hops, I mean props, to their beer! $16  The reason I can't tell you which sausage was the best is because service is mostly nonexistent. I guess if your basic couple is likely to spend $100, and most people tip 20%, you don't have to do much to get halfway decent pay by default. Our waitress took our order, kitchen staff brought it out and took it away, waitress brought our bill. The end. Gave us a vague and rushed \"you good?\" as she walked by once, but otherwise did the bare minimum. There was a featured dessert trio, but only one sounded appealing. Disappointed that they are unable to accommodate an order for a single dessert without spending $15 on the bunch of them.",

The Oktoberfest beer was yummy enough for a second!    The band was different on this visit. Change is good! It's reasonable that locals might tire of the same ol same ol or maybe all of my visits happened to have been on nights the old band was booked.   Blood sausage caught my dining partners attention. By the time I glanced at his plate to ask for a bite.... It was gone!  As it was a first for him I asked before it was served what his plan was if he didn't find it to his liking!  His response ... \"Eat it !\"  His take on it? It's \"ok\". I don't think he's a fan!   Fun way to spend a late afternoon! I've felt for a very long time that Hofbrau Haus is a gem among many in Vegas. For us tho it's a taste of one of our homes... It's sister location in Newport KY was home to many of our family celebrations.",

Only thing about it that I wish I knew beforehand was that in order for your party to be seated, you had to have half of your party within a 15 minute mark. I wasn't informed of that, so my table was given up and had to fit at a table where 16 people only sat. Kind of hard, but my group made it happen. Overall, I had a great experience with the servers, people nearby enjoying the same atmosphere since we were seated in the main hall. Loud, but great since you can see everything happening and it was a lot of fun! I would recommend it to those who don't mind a crazy atmosphere!",

    "text": "If you judge this place based on the atmosphere of the original location in Munich, this place actually does a pretty good job.  Parking is available in the back, but the lot isn't the biggest.  We ended up parking at the Hyatt next door (signage seemed to indicate it was allowed but I can't be sure).  While waiting in front, there's a bar area where you can chill over a beer or two, or browse the souvenir shop.  The main dining room of this location is noticeably smaller than its German big brother, but they did a lot of work painting the interior to match the real deal.  Special mention goes to the ceiling artwork.  The back of the hall has an \"outdoor\" dining room that is quite stunning.  It's fully indoors, but the sky-painted ceilings and decor really make you think you're dining on a patio.  This outdoor room is reserved for special occasions though.  There was a football match the day we went, so they had TVs wheeled out.  There's this one guy hired to play the alpenhorn, and he was go around making sure everyone was slightly drunk and happy.  Not the same as the real band in Munich, but he kept us all amused.  Beers are available in 0.3L, 0.5L, and 1.0L varieties.  Hopefully you know your metric.  One great thing about weissbier (wheat beer) is that it goes down easy.  There are different varieties for you to try as well.  And for the most authentic experience, you obviously want the biggest glass.  I don't even think they have the smaller ones in Germany, but that was a few years back.  Food is quite delightful and quite authentic, but not for everyone.  Many of the foods are pickled.  The sausages were decent but a bit on the mushy side.  But I really enjoyed their pickled beet salad (mush?) and sauerkraut - both quite good.  Service was prompt and very friendly.  Wi-Fi is available, but it was quite spotty.  The only thing is that this place can get pricey really quickly.  At some $20 a dish and $10 for a beer, you can see how this can get expensive if you have a family.  Of course, at the end, be sure to swing by the souvenir shop if you didn't do so at the beginning.  Much of the swag doesn't say \"Las Vegas\" on it, so if you wanted to trick someone into thinking you went to Germany..  Overall, a fun time.  Not exactly what you'd experience as a tacky tourist in Germany, but actually quite close.",

The sauerkraut was fine but it won't knock your socks off.  No substitutions: what does that say to your overpaying customers? Sorry, some of us have dietary restrictions...

Now I can't even fathom the idea of starting off my annual trip to Vegas with Jenn, Annette and Kristen without your delicious pretzels and ginormous brews!  Just think... after a long 4-5 hour drive in the sun, what could possibly be better than a very large, very cold beer and delicious carbs and wieners? NOTHING.   This time around we just indulged in beer and a pretzel. I always go for the dark, or the dunkel, which is rich but still refreshing and thirst quenching. The pretzel comes out warm, perfectly browned on the outside and fluffy on the inside. The pretzel comes with three dipping mustards - a sweet mustard, a cheesy delish whipped mustard and regular mustard. All three are great, and I don't even like mustard.   The atmosphere couldn't get better. Friendly and welcoming, a very large and spacious room with fun German decor. I love the pretzels and lobsters painted all over the ceiling. Weird, but it seems to work. Plus having activities like playing quarters into your steins and dancing the chicken dance just add to getting one pumped up for being in Vegas!  I'll be back soon Hofbrauhaus!",

Ordered the Radler. It's not on the menu but it's beer with some 7Up. It just makes it taste a little bit better. I actually never eat here just because we wind up drinking. The other thing we order is the giant pretzel. It comes with two types of mustard and this great german cheese. It's like a spicy cream cheese. They have usually a German/Austrian band that does some German sing alongs as well as American classics (Sweet Caroline etc) - It's a fun place to go and NOT very Las Vegas'y at all (which I love).",

The beer comes in gigantic 1-liter steins...yet it's pretty dang good!  Definitely go to the Hofbrauhaus with a group.  Experience it to the fullest: dance, sing, finally put that high school German to use!  And stay for the cowbells!  I would recommend downing a few gut biers ahead of time, though, as each stein-full will set you back as any drink does in Vegas.  The food was pleasantly awesome.  Maybe with those big community tables, I was just Jonesing for some Viking food.  But I ordered the Grillhendl.  This massive half-chicken filled me up after I'd gone most of the day without food.  It was basted with butter and herbs beneath a  crispy brown skin.  On the side: they offer a potato salad that is the best I've ever paid for.  You'll walk out of Hofbrauhaus feeling like Beowulf.",

The sauerbraten was not as tender as it should be, and the veggies uninspired (but German uninspired).  Worst of all, they have about 4 of their own beers and their menu logically says all are available in 3 sizes.  But when we ordered a small (10 oz) hefe, we were told it only comes in liters and half liters.  Now I ask anyone with common sense:  what in the WORLD is the reason for that \"rule\"?  We are there to try beers for heavens sake.  You'd think that with over 10 years at this LV location, they'd know better.  Don't go if you are on the borderline;  find something else.",

    "text": "This is a Vegas ritual for my group.  The only reason to not go while I'm in Vegas is if I'm there with silly \"let's go clubbing! woooo!\" girls... because this is not the place for them.  This is the place for the cool girls who can hold their own in a group of guys, and are more than happy to give up LAX or Rain for a semi-authentic German oompah band playing covers - in German.  It's just plain fun.    On a recent trip with said WOOgirls, my sadness at being kept from my beloved Hofbrauhaus overwhelmed and I had to stop in to pick up some food to take home to LA.  A few pretzels (gotta share with the hubs) and some spaetzle would do me just fine.  I got there 15 minutes before opening (couldn't find their hours online), and they unlocked the doors just for me.  Took my to-go order, churned it out quickly and with a smile.  AND they gave me extra spaetzle, just cuz they're nice like that.  Why not 5 stars?  Well... okay.  The bill for my to-go order came to $43 after tip.  I remember this vividly because it was a money-stressing weekend, and every expenditure's exact value is burned into my retinas.  Checking mint a few days later, I saw that Hofbrauhaus had charged me $48.  Yes, it's $5, but it's shady - and makes me wonder how often this might \"just happen\" here?  Of course, you can't really do much about something like that, because at that point it's their word against yours... so I let it slide, and choose to not let it ruin my love of the Hofbrauhaus.  I will, however, be paying cash from this point forward.",

    "text": "Some colleagues and I visited this location of the Hofbrauhaus on a business trip to Las Vegas. We'd previously visited the location in Newport, KY.  This location was not as good as the Newport version. The beer is not brewed on the premises, and the variety was severely limited (no Maibock!). In fact, there were only two options: dark and light.  The waitress was not able to describe the beer adequately either.  It's not that the beer wasn't bad -- it was very tasty and a good alternative compared to casino offerings -- I was just looking forward to a bock or something else.  The food was also a little disappointing compared to Newport. I didn't order the same item as I had previously, but something about it didn't sing. But it was good nonetheless.  I left full and content.  If you're a German beer/food lover in Vegas, you'd do well to visit this location of the Hofbrauhaus. Just make sure you hit up their location in Newport at some point as well for a better experience.",

We stopped by for lunch. I had the Munchner Schweinerbraten (pork roast). The flavor was wonderful. Slow roasted comfort food at its finest. My only complaint was that the roast was a bit too fatty. The sauerkraut was spectacular! It had the right balance of sour...I hate sauerkraut that makes me pucker! I washed it all down with Hofbrau original beer (yummy).   If you happen to be in Vegas and are looking for a good restaurant off the strip, think about trying Hofbrauhaus. If you go for dinner, they most likely will have a German band which only makes the experience more fun. I recommend this place. The food will not disappoint.",

Oh yes and beer and spankings, yes spankings. If you are the S&M, Christian Grey loving person then this is the place for you. Apparently if you order a shot of this dark liquor (Perhaps Jagermister?) you get a spanking by a waitress in a laderhousen (That Hansel and Gretel outfit with suspenders). This I did not indulge in, but many many men around our table did. We went late in the evening so the giant dinning room was emptying out so I assume we didnt get to see all the possibilities of spanking. Okay so the important stuff- the food. I ordered a white sausage dish at the recommendation of the waitress, interesting. I am not a huge sausage fan, but since I was here the sausage kingdom, figured I should try it. It came with potatoes and sauerkraut. I also of course drank a lot of beer and perhaps if I drank more the food would have tasted better. We also ordered a traditional pretzel with cheese dip and mustards, now that was tasty (The beer probably helped with this). I am not going to lie the German dinners that shared our table and the authentic German band probably helped me like this place more, it certainly wasn't the food.  So all in all, I would come back to drink and eat pretzels, not to eat. So drink up! Das boot!",

It was  hilarious when the guys started singing Neil Diamond and lost their accents.  There was a woman who sold shots of Jager and gave spanks with a paddle.

    "text": "The iconic Hofbrahaus is well known to any long time vegas resident. It's that beautiful white building on the corner of paradise and harmon. For those of you who haven't been there, let me tell you what to expect. It's beautiful on the inside as well-- designed to look like a real german (or Austrian?) beer house. There are large painted pillars abound and a blissfully peaceful looking beer garden in the back. The waitresses all wear authentic german garb and the gift shop offers large glass steins for sale.  First off, let me tell you that the food is not fantastic. Even if you are a bratwurst fan, I don't think you'll be blown away by the cuisine-- but i suppose that depends on your tastes. I'm not impressed with their pretzel or any of their chicken dishes either. It's not terrible but it just isn't that great. Of course, you don't really come to this place for the food. Then there is the service, which again, isn't really that great. The waitresses are a step up above the ones who work at Hooters but not quite as competent as those working at your local family style chain restaurant. They tend to be painfully slow and often mix up orders when bringing them back to the table.  And of course, the actual beer. It's good quality brew but it doesn't really impress me either. I've had their lager, dark ale, and hefeweizen. I'm begrudged to admit that their hefeweizen is hardly better than the Widmer you can buy at your local Albertsons or Wal-Mart. But you could argue that you really don't come here for the beer either-- you're here for the package it comes in.  This is one of the most fun environments for a moderate to large group that you can find in Vegas. The live band plays plenty of recognizable tunes for singing along with,  the birthday boy/girl is encouraged to drink from Das Boot (ala Beer Fest), the drinking games on stage are tons of fun and of course, there is MC Johannes. Johannes may well be the funniest man of german descent ever to grace to earth.  His crude sense of humor tends to play better with the male dominated audience but I'm sure the ladies appreciate him as well. His comedy is mostly off the cuff, as can be observed by the way he interacts with the various patrons. Anytime a member of your partner is interacting with Johannes, you can expect to find yourself bursting out in laughter.  The bill unforunately, is not so funny. You'll find that their food is overpriced and their beer isn't really that affordable either. Still, the birthday boy/girl will be overjoyed that you treated them to this place so it ultimately is worth it. Come here for the beer, stay for the atmosphere.",

The waitresses were very nice, polite and cute and I love their accents.

She does however, like hofbrauhaus beer. This is like someone whose scale of beer is from a 1 (dislike) to 3 (somewhat dislike)...so this is beyond impressive.  Meanwhile, there's lots of singing, dancing, and altogether humorous fake sky-ceiling to go along with everything else.  Food is Bavarian, so mostly meat, but the pretzels are awesome and come with normal mustard along with sweet/spicy mustard.  Meanwhile, the spanking. How does it work?

They supply complimentary parking for guests which is a plus but they can get filled pretty fast.  If you're a fan of sausage this has a multitude of them. From veal, pork, beef, chicken and everything in between these little packages of goodness will not disappoint. I had the veal and pork white sausage that had no taste that you just had to dip it in order to have some kind of movement in your mouth. I also opted for the half chicken which was amazing with their brown gravy like sauce. The potato salad was a bit sour for my taste and not creamy enough. But when it all goes down, nothing beats a cold German lager that are all imported straight from the source.  So if you want a loud, testosterone filled evening with a bunch of loud cheesy karaoke singing, look no further and choose here!",

There are random stand up and sing alongs. It's a loud and lively and feels just like a beer hall.   The place is extremely we'll run and has super clean bathrooms. The server was well trained and attentive.",

    "text": "I usually find when visiting novelty foreign restaurants/bars in Vegas that they are made to be cheesy cliches with sub-par 'versions' of what you could find at the real thing, but this was not the case at Hofbrauhaus!  As a European and having visited a Hofbrauhaus in Germany, you'll get a fun and authentic experience here and a lot of thought has been put in, from the inside, out!  We chose to chill at the bar and service was great! Beer's are aplenty and obviously European, with your choice of by the bottle or on tap!  There's so much on the menu, it's hard to know where to start, but in the end, we tried 320 Leberkase - the sausage meat loaf with potato salad and 306 Weisswurste - the grilled famous white sausages with pretzel. Both came with mustard.  The 320 (sausage meat loaf) was quite heavy, but tasty and the light side it came with balanced it well. 306 was really good too! The sausage was seasoned really well and the pretzel was soft in the middle with a crunch on the outside.   The atmosphere was great too! The bar was bustling but not too loud and the hall itself was warm and inviting with some live Bavarian music playing while we were there.  Definitely worth returning and a place I can imagine spending hours enjoying great food, beer and company!",

This time came with a friend and they had a typical German dish, forget the name,  but gave me some and was tasty but a little dry.   My meal on the other hand, had the half lamb and half beef burger. Had it before here and this time it was immensely better. Moist and not as dense, packed full of flavor.   Didn't have any adult beverages and seems like they had a good selection of German drinks.   For what get I feel is actually a decent price for the quality.   Very pleased! Very tasty!

This is the greatest place I have ever had a beer!   We walked in to people standing on benches, swinging huge mugs of beer in air and singing 80's songs at the top of their lungs. I was home! The beer hall was electric! Some guy with a thick German accent was DJ'ing on stage. Playing the hits of my youth, leading beer conga lines throughout the maze of of communal tables all as the waitress and waiters brought out an endless supply of real German beer to the tables.   But wait, it gets better. A couple of (i assume) German guys in Lederhosen came out to sing and play authentic German music. They came by the tables playing a guitar and accordion. Then they broke out the horn from the Ricola commercials! SO MUCH FUN!!!  Top all of this amazing entertainment off with WONDERFUL food and it just doesn't get any better. Hofbrauhaus is a stand alone reason to come to Vegas. And yes, I will come back to this town just for the Hofbrauhaus.  And this was all done in (fairly) family friendly atmosphere. Prost!",

We ended up ordering for pretzel tower appetizers and family style meals. We allowed the guests to order whatever drinks they wanted and our bill was $1200 before tip. We ended up leaving with plenty of leftovers and full bellies. My favorite parts of the dinner was the shot for a swat experience.

Their beer selection is good, the location is huge and very lively including friendly welcoming staff. I tried their house sausage with a side order of spatzel and a cold beer. I enjoyed the beer but the sausage and spatzel were nothing to write home about , odd texture on both and lack of flavour as well. The location was loud which I expected but it was so loud to the point that you can't even hear yourself  think much less speak to a person sitting right beside you. They have a beer garden in the back that looked more peaceful. This place is good for groups in terms of space but not sure anyone would be able to mingle or have a conversation unless they are right beside you and want to yell the entire time. Not my favourite spot",

    "text": "I had lunch at Hofbrauhaus yesterday. Since my last Vegas visit it seems like the food has improved. I had a sausage plate that was really good. The beer as always is as good as it gets. The prices are slightly higher than other Hofbrauhaus locations that I have dined at but are within reason by Vegas standards.   My waitress, Amanda was exceptional. Service was quick and efficient although it was early afternoon and not very crowded. When I told Amanda that my personal Hofbrauhaus tradition is to get the swat for a swat she provided the service with gusto.   All in all a good meal and a fun time. I will be back the next time I am in Vegas.",

We went on a weeknight and I can imagine how packed it becomes on the weekends.  I would come here if you are looking for a little noise and a good time!  The food and beer was delicious.  We had pretzels, kraut and tons of sausage to start which all was amazing.  Or main entrees were delicious too and the mashed potatoes were to die for!  It was also super entertaining to order jager shots",

    "text": "This has been my fourth trip here and before this last time, I would have rated it a 5, but not this last trip.  I was so disappointed. I brought my entire  family here to celebrate our German heritage and it was so disappointing.  The restaurant was not busy, but we were seated away from at to  the side of the live music. That is part of the great fun of this place. Secondly, even though our waiter was really great, the food was not.  I honestly do not know how other people could have rated the food as good. Maybe they've never had really good German food before? The schnitzel across the board was greasy and not flavorful.  The potato salad wasn't edible.  The only thing that was good was the pretzel and green salad.  Both were very fresh.  The clincher for me was how my husband was treated.  His food came out 20 (yes, 20 minutes) after the rest of ours and it was so greasy, you could see the oil pooling on the plate.  He took 2 bites and couldn't eat it.  The busser  came and took his plate away and we asked to speak to a manager.  After the long wait and the really bad food, we felt we shouldn't have been charged for his food.  The manager was not nice or apologetic.  She said she needed to see his plate to show it to the cook, but it was already removed.  It's not like we were trying to pull something over.  We were a party of 11 and had ordered appetizers, lots of drinks and main courses.  A big bill.  We were just asking for the late and inedible plate to be taken off.  She finally and reluctantly agreed, but made us feel like we did something wrong.  It was very upsetting. I'd also like to state, that my husband is one of the most kindest and polite persons I know. He did not come off in any type of a rude fashion. And as much as I love this place in the past, I don't know if I will ever return. I probably could look past the bad food, but not the service and how my husband was treated. It makes me sad,  because it was one of my favorite places to go every time I visited Vegas.",

    "text": "Bier is beer... not True!  Came here with a few friends to tilt back a few German beers.  We had a great time with the live entertainment and the food.  The crowd was very friendly and enjoying themselves.  You can actually have a great time in Vegas without gambling or clubbing.  From the live band to the chicken dance being performed by the crew... this place was hopping!    Parking is easy but getting here and getting out is difficult as it is very close to the exit of the McCarran Airport.   My favorite of all their beers is the Original.  It's very smooth and refreshing.  As for their food, their pretzel and bratwurst were the perfect combination.  The pretzel was heavily salted but I was able to offset it with the several dipping sauces.  The bratwurst was perfectly cooked and packed with flavor.  If you're into contests and love free beer, volunteer for their games!  You'll get a huge amount of beef for free, win or lose.  If you enjoy yourself, you can buy a little or big keepsake from their storefront.   If you're looking for a place to celebrate any occasion or even get married, this is a great option.  They have a huge beer garden with a fountain as well as a patio.    If you plan on drinking tons, be sure to take a taxi or uber.   If you plan on driving, use Valet.   Cheers!",

I knew going in that it was going to be loud based on other reviews.  When we arrived, we entered the front area that had a small bar, hostess stand, and a gift shop.  We requested seating and the hostess asked if we had reservations.  \"No, we don't\".  She then asked my name - no problem, my phone number - really, and my email address.  I felt like I was undergoing a background check to get a seat.  We were led to an empty table (this is all community seating) that would sit about 8 people.  We were back near the beer glass storage and in front of a wait station.  The seats were fine and it was definitely loud.    Our server came quickly and took our drink orders and our food orders.  While we were waiting on our food, the alpenhorn began its trip around the restaurant.  The guy sets the horn on the table in the diners' faces and tries to play a tune.  I think you are supposed to put money in the horn when he is done.  I watched this for several minutes, and just when I thought it was over, he approached our table.  I shook my head \"no\".  He kept coming.  I looked him in the eye and shook my head \"no\" again.  He just smiled and put the horn directly in my face.  I got up from the table and walked away.  He was not deterred.  He proceeded to play in my wife's face.  I have some hearing issues and that noise that close causes me a lot of discomfort.  This was the point my visit went downhill.  Our food was delivered.  I ordered a chicken sandwich (I am not a big fan of German food).  It was dry and bland, but edible.  The french fries were good.  My drink was empty and did not see the waitress until I was 3/4 finished with my meal.  After that she was able to be more attentive and fill our drinks a couple more times.    If the alpenhorn wasn't enough, someone thinks it is a good idea to plan the National Anthem in a restaurant during supper.  Nothing like having to get up in the middle of a meal to salute the flag.  What are these people thinking?  I can honestly say I will not go back to this place.  It definitely is not for me.  I saw several groups enjoying themselves while drinking beer and taking shots.  It was entertaining to watch the drunks celebrate.  It kind of reminded me of the Strohaus at the 1982 World's Fair, but not done nearly as well.",

I toured Allianz Arena, where FC Bayern Munchen play enjoyable world football. I did the beer tour and the final stop was Hofbrauhaus. I enjoyed the company of a very nice Canadian family and we met a fine group of people, Russian folks. We had some beers/biers, Mas Helles, Eins oder zwei, I think. The place in Vegas reminds me of Munich Hofbrauhaus. Vegas is smaller and quieter. I like the German style pretzel, sausages, wursts and I'm going to go big next week. I hope they have those roasted pork shanks with the crisp outer crust. I'll take a mas Helles too. That is a liter with some foam for bouquet. Beer. Bier. Bitte. Danke.",

Once I heard that this restaurant had it, I knew this was my first stop on my next visit to Vegas. The meat was tender and the skin was crispy, but the flavor wasn't as good as the one in Munich.  The pretzel was just ok but I liked the mustard dipping sauce.  The grilled sausage lacked any sear and was just boring to eat.    Also, if you buy a shot, it comes served on a paddle which the server will spank you with.  I've heard they hit pretty hard.

    "text": "We had our wedding reception here. We had about 30 people and it ended up being buffet. The food was wonderful and the staff were prompt and nice! The pork roast was amazing and so tender!!!!  Originally we requested the beer hall, but it was insane being Oktoberfest, so they moved us to the gardens. I actually think this was a better idea and they gave us a big screen tv to watch the festivities in the beer hall.   Due to a family issue, we initially had 58 people we contracted for, but it ended up being 31 people instead. Although the contract was written that we would lose money on guests 31-48, they offered us some options that made us feel a lot better about our experience.   I would definitely suggest this restaurant for large groups and wedding receptions. It was so much fun!!  Big thanks to Karen K who helped us arrange everything!",

The staff well they made sure we didn't wait for anything. When drinks where 3/4 down. The next one was at your table. Staff kept coming to the table to check on us! The entertainment, well that was just a laugh. They completely make you feel like your at home and feels like your are in Germany. Great place. Great food. Great staff.",

This was our first visit to Hofbrauhaus and were instantly impressed by the design of the building.  We recently visited Germany and it reminded us of some of the towns we visited.  Our waitress, Michelle, was super friendly and helpful.  She was actually from Germany and we talked about some of the places we visited.  The food was great and there is a large selection.  Definitely try the kasespatzle, which was one of my favorite dishes in Germany and they do a great job with it at Hofbrauhaus.  Tip...the Hofbrauhaus website will give you a coupon for a free beer if you sign-up for their newsletter.",

    "text": "I'd first heard of the Hofbrauhaus on the Food Network a few years ago. It was highly recommended for it's authentic food and dining atmosphere from what I remember.  I love, love, love German food, and hadn't had any in several months, plus after skipping lunch in favor of a few pitchers of poolside drinks, my husband and I were really in the mood for some salty, carb-y food...and what could be better than spaetzle!  I was aware of the live entertainment and therefore brought earplugs. I'm glad I did! As we walked in the dining room, there was a lady standing on the bench of her community table, clapping to the Dire Straights cover band. Also, if spankings by dirndl-wearing waitresses is on your bucket list (for some reason) you can get, or watch that done here.  Overall, the food was decent, definitely got the carbs we came for but I've been spoiled by Uwe's in Colorado Springs. Hofbrauhaus doesn't live up, but in all fairness that's a very high bar!  If you're not into the kinda touristy place that has an attached gift shop, I'd skip it.",

The live \"music\" so unnecessarily loud that no one can hear themselves think and the criminally overpriced beer/drinks are tolerable, but the adult-children for staff/management (who take zero responsibility for their own screw-ups) are not.  We were here about a week and a half ago hanging out and having beers. When it was time to pay the tab and leave, the server hands back the receipt with a massive charge for stuff we didn't even order. Then, only when asked what the deal was with the charge, he's like, \"Oh... I messed up.\" We asked to speak with the manager, and he comes over and immediately gets argumentative with my fiancee. \"Well, I really don't see what the problem is. The money's gonna get back to you anyway, isn't it?\" Actually, no. You high school drama teacher-looking moron. The money has STILL not been refunded. Oh, AND they charged the money for the initial tab on top of it. Yeah, because we didn't have rent to pay the following week or anything.  I've heard nothing but terrible things about this place's service, and this just proves it. Hell, they even treat their own employees like garbage. I'm honestly shocked to hell at some of this dump's 4-star/5-star reviews, and I'm wondering which place they were at.",

The waitresses were all super friendly and danced. It's set up like a hall and you sit at long tables with strangers if you're not in a big group but that's part of the fun! As you get drunk off the liter beers maybe take a shot but be warned if you do the waitress will spank your booty with a paddle. Saw one waitress who was at least 6'2\" smacked guy's asses so hard I was thinking they probably couldn't sit for awhile. HA! I opted out of the shots and enjoyed the pain of the other patrons.",

However, I am reviewing and only giving them 3 stars due to an incident at the reception desk last night. The actions and assumptions by the hostess were uncalled for and wrong.  I was coming from a trade show and had been given an aluminum water bottle which was in my hand. I was immediately jumped on by a very rude hostess who emphatically told me that I couldn't bring in outside beer. The bottle is black so you can't tell if it even has anything in it at all. I replied that it was an empty bottle. Again I was emphatically told no outside beer and she pointed to an area by the bar to put my bottle. Again I said it is empty and I wasn't going to drop it off. More lip from this loser so I took the cap off the bottle right in front of her and turned the bottle upside down to empty the contents on the lobby floor. A piece of paper fell out so she finally figured that it was new and didn't contain any liquid including beer. I was about to walk when she wised up and asked how many. I told her I have a reservation, but may not ever again. We were seated up front and enjoyed the rest of the evening. Too bad the first person we talked to was so rude and ignorant. She would be the perfect employee for United Airlines.  And why would I bring in outside beer when theirs is good? This place just lost 5 spots on my list of Vegas restaurants to try to get to when I am in town for trade shows.",

Overall it was a fun evening and I had a good time.  I would go back to this restaurant with a group of friends but the volume is high enough that I would avoid taking anyone I wanted to have a good conversation with.    That said there were some issues.    First:  The music when we showed up was really fun.  It wasn't authentic seeming but it was good party music.  They did have a little tribute with an alphorn that the band members carried from table to table.  Then the band took a break and when they came back the music style swapped from accordions to guitars and they began playing music that really did not fit the pre-break atmosphere.  I also felt it was inappropriate when they asked everyone to stand for the national anthem, it is not Veteran's day or Memorial day and I did not go to a Bavarian/German restaurant to be invaded by US politics.  Really....if you're gonna play an anthem, at least play one from Germany.    Second:  The food was mediocre at best.  There was very little sauerkraut on the plate and the sausages were somewhat bland.  I ordered a pretzel and it came from the kitchen half frozen.  Presentation of the plate was poor and unappealing.  I really did enjoy the darker beer though.    Third:  Price.  At 20$ each, I would expect a lot more in both quality and presentation.",

It is a bit noisy in there, but makes up for it on the food and the entertainment.  There is a band playing some German and American music while you are eating.  We had the Sauerbraten,  Jagerschnitzel and a special sausage dish that came with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  We really loved everything but the Jagerschnitzel.  That was just so-so and would not get that again.  The Sauerbraten was to die for and highly recommend it.  The sausage was also very tasty.  With the sauerkraut and side of red cabbage made everything even more enjoyable.  We had the Apfelstrudel for desert which was excellent and is a must try for the full German experience.  I highly recommend this place.  We definitely will come back.",

The band sounds good, but whenever a person speaks into the microphone it sounds so muffled and garbled its impossible to understand. If they correct that, the atmosphere will be even more party-like and would get much greater participation from customers. As it is, only a couple of tables nearest the stage can understand because they are closest to the stage monitors which are clear and crisp.  It would be nice if everyone, especially those who answer the phone, and the hostesses are informed of what is going on.  I planned to compete in their \"Octoberfest\" competition and even brought seven friends to cheer me on. We had dinner and drinks, but when it came time for the contest, management said they didn't know why it had happened at an earlier time than scheduled.  I had called and checked first for the times, checked their website, and even looked in the newspaper that they put on my table! All three sources had confirmed they have two contests per night on Fridays and Saturdays.  My friends and I left very disappointed, more from management's total lack of customer service than anything else. They did nothing to even attempt to make it right, they just made excuses and blamed others.  I guess they just feel that they are successful so they don't need to even try.",

Food-  The food was average.  Large portions, so expect leftovers or share plates.  They definitely missed the mark on the pretzel, did not taste fresh and it wasn't served warm.

The sauerkraut though was just beautiful. I'd call it new sauerkraut because it was less fermented than normal which made it very pleasant to eat on its own. I think the food is reasonably priced, expect $20 an entree, given the added cost of the semi elaborate accompanying atmosphere.  Now while the atmosphere was fun, I'd prefer if the live music matched the theme of the restaurant a bit more. Hearing songs like the U.S. national anthem and other U.S. classics was kind of odd in a place this strongly German themed. The beers were great, and the waitresses gave out incredibly entertaining paddle spankings with the purchase of a shot. It's fun! -- but it could be better.",

And they don't even pour it, it's all measured out and done for them. Seems like the owners are a bit hard up. Where's the trust for their own employees?",

    "text": "I do my best to stop in at the Hofbrau every time I go to Vegas. It's a fun environment that brings a different style to the table in a town full of hotel bars and clubs.   People have told me that the Hofbrau Las Vegas is an exact replica of the Hofbrau in Munich. I'm not happy to admit that when I was at the Hofbrau in Munich some years ago, things were a little blurry. Lets just say the Deutsch begin the festivities rather early on Easter Sunday. Either way, from my fuzzy memory the Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a very similar feel to the original. The beer is all the original Hofbrau brew, and they serve it in the traditional stein (although I don't remember them having a smaller one in Germany). Last time I went I got the Oktoberfest in Das Boot! I was a little upset that the boot was plastic, but it still turns into an endurance trial toward the end of the beer- which can be fun, or not so fun all depending.  The food is all traditional Bavarian style- so be ready for sausage and potatoes! I still have yet to encounter anything I disliked on the menu but I highly suggest getting a soft pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel is huge and comes with an array of dipping selections- all of which are great.  I think the biggest difference between the original and Vegas location is how the entertainment is catered toward the crowd. The original had a very traditional German brass band sort of playing in the background. The Vegas Hofbrau certainly has a bit more of a 'showy' feel to it. They're constantly playing German drinking songs along with many popular songs to keep the crowd involved. They also play a bunch of games. Such as 'last man holding the stein wins'. Also, if you really want, the waitress will slap you on the ass with a paddle with a sound that will ring out though the entire building. I haven't done it myself. Not gonna lie, I'm afraid of getting tagged in the coin purse.  If you're looking for a different experience in the sometimes overly repetitive town of Las Vegas, I suggest hitting up the Hofbrau. In True fashion of the town, you probably won't leave sober, but you will have a unique experience and not be surrounded by the hotel bar hookers like the rest of the town.  Prost!",

The atmosphere is very similar to a Oktoberfest. The house beer is very good too. The cheesecake is the best I have ever had.   On this trip we started with a beer and jumbo complete pretzel. Everyone loved it, even my girlfriend who does not care for breads. The waiter was very friendly and talked with us for awhile answering all our stupid questions about Germany and it's culture. Before the food was served the band played the chicken dance. Unfortunately that night only my girlfriend and me joined the waiter to do the dance. What is up with that?   I got the Allgauer Kasespatzle which is similar to mac and cheese. My girlfriend ordered the Munchner Weisswurste and Richard ordered the sampler plate which had sausage, pork chop, pork tenderloin, and sauerkraut. He shared the tenderloin and the review was that it is amazing. For dessert we had the cheese cake and apple strudel.   I like to try and visit to place on every trip to Vegas. The more people in the group the better. The restaurant is in it's own building and parking is free and right next to the place. There is a gift shop too.",

The first day we went for lunch, the band played German music giving the place that Bavarian festive atmosphere. Really fun.   We went back two days later at night. How disappointing. The same band was playing American music, catering to the myriads of drunks. I guess that's what they are supposed to do - get customers to drink beer, but the Bavarian feel was gone. Had we known that, we could have gone to eat somewhere we could have enjoyed it. Nicht gut!",

    "text": "So, after finding out that the place that I stayed at had a Bavarian restaurant next door I had to go; there was no question.  The restaurant stays close to its roots with a big dining hall full of long tables and giant 1L beer glasses.  Perfect for a good Bavaian experience.  In my opinion so far of Vegas... A lot of it seems to be for the show and not quite for the quality.  This is kinda one of them.  Sure everyone's in costume, there's  oompa band and all, but the food is merely MEH...  Instinctively, I ordered the sausage platter.  I figured I'd get a good taste of everything.  Plus, I added a order of spatzle on the side (CAUSE I LOVE SPATZLE!!!).  The first thing I noticed that everyone was pronouncing spatzle wrong (whatever...).  Anyways, my platter came with an assortment of sausages (2 vienna frankfurters, 1 chicken and 1 pork with a bunch of sauerkraut  and mash potatoes, mustard and hunter sauce.  After trying everything I came to one conclusion.  This is more about the show than it is about the food.  The vienna franks were terrible.  If you want to try them... go to Costco... they sell them there.  The only good sausage was the pork one.  And even then it was still \"OK\".  The sauerkraut was alright... but definately out of a jar that they bought in bulk.  It wasn't exactly the best sauerkraut I've had.    The spatzle wasn't really made very well either.  I believe they just boiled it and strained it.  Good spatzle is pan fried after... (the best is in butter... MMMMMMMmmmm butter...).  This kinda had the consistency of soggy popcorn.  The flavour was alright (because it had herbs in it), but it would have been much better if it was pan fried afterwards.  The best thing really about this place is the atmosphere.  If you've never been to a bavarian beer/sausage house it's something that you have to experience (without actually having to go to an oktoberfest).  I mean it's not the same, but at least they try and give you the gist of it.  The weirdest thing was that no one knew the german drinking anthem and what to do; they really had to push it whenever they decided to \"lift their steins\".  That and the waitress's were forced to do the chicken dance everytime it came one.  OMG i felt so bad for the waitresses, as if they are made to dance everytime that song came one.  They were like chicken dance robots...  Definitely at least try this place if you haven't been to a bavarian beer/sausage house.  Personally I think even the one at EPCOT centre in Florida is better.  Order a giant beer and have a good time with your friends.  Don't expect the food to be amazing.    PS. They actually sell the 2L Das Boot here... so if you're a collector like me... get one.  Then you can have Boot races...",

Went here this past Wednesday night and the band was playing Oktoberfest type music so it was loud, fun and lively.  And then there was the Jaegermeister girl doling out shots and spankings (for a price of course)...that was entertaining to watch.  The hall itself was about 2/3 full so we had good service.  (The beer garden was closed.)  Family style seating.... we sat at a table with another couple but we had plenty of room to spread out and didn't feel like we were in each other's space.  The food was plentiful and typical German.... hearty and filling.  Good flavor and as I've not been to Germany I would have to assume not as good as the real thing but pretty darn close.  Saw that they have daily lunch specials for $10, so I'll go back since I know I'll come home with leftovers.",

Good thing it wasnt summer time when I visited this place or otherwise I probably would not have eaten there. The portions were huge! I don't think any girl wants to have a food baby during bathing suit season!   This is definitely not a place for a quiet mellow meal.  The waittresses and entertainer were very involved with the crowd. Quite the ruckus! Loved the high energy atmosphere.   i started off with the potato soup. It was good but not anything to swoon over. I had shared the Hofbrauhus Wurstplatte (sampler platter) and Nurnberger Rostbratwurst (pork sausage). My two favorites was the chicken sausage and pork sausage. if i knew how good the chicken was, i would have NOT gotten the sampler platter. I had the original and dunkel beer to chase down on the deliciousness. Definitely some good beer.   Oh and also, when i had visited, they had a beer chugging contest! I got volunteered and won against 5 guys and 4 other girls. I have the 32 oz beer mug as a trophy. ;-)   definitely would return back here!",

Good times!  Who cares if you don't know anyone here.  Bring some friends along and make some new ones while you're there.  The long tables and benches are meant for sharing with others and meeting new people.  Don't be shy!  Who cares if you're not German.  I'm not and definitely could never pass as one, but had a great time nonetheless.  In fact, some German folks were smiling at us because we were having such a great time.  That or they were surprised we knew the lyrics to some of the German drinking songs.  Yeah me and my buddies faked it pretty damn good.  Who cares if you don't speak German.  Drink and sing along at the top of your lungs and mumble something in tune.  Shoot make up your own lyrics if you want.  Just make sure to sway your stein back and forth up in the air.  You'll look stupid if you don't because you'll be the only one.  Who cares if you don't drink beer (WHAT!? Fine I'll drink it for you).  You'll still have a great time laughing at everybody and enjoying the band.  What you do drink beer??  The steins look big and intimidating, but if you do the math you'll realize how many bottles of beer is actually in one.....so order the biggest stein.  It's such a great feeling holding one in your hand.  So much power!  The beer goes down really smooth and its not at all filling.  It's a great feeling of being in a large room set up like an indoor beer garden and feeling like you're part of some big community or party.  Major plus is the band drinking along with everyone and singing at the same time!  Major skills there.  Definite good time.  Waitresses here are awesome....very friendly and there to make sure you have a great time.  By the way, make sure to ask for a round of shots for you and your guests.  Or at least a shot for your best bud you're drinking with.  It's tradition.  Everytime I brought my buddies here we always had a great time enjoying the \"party\" atmosphere, singing, drinking, and laughing the night away.  Oh yeah, make sure you buy a souvenir stein before you leave (they have a gift shop).  It'll make you smile everytime you use it or see it at home.  Buy the big one.  Good times!",

Being by myself on business, I don't like eating by myself. But they have really large tables that they sit out at, family style. So I kind of was sitting next to people in a way. Coupled with the live band and the other stuff going on, I felt like part of the festivities rather than the lone business traveler sitting at dinner.  They have a couple types of beer and a couple sizes. Of course, when the server asked me if I wanted a beer and I replied \"yes\", then I should have been more specific. Because he brought out the large one that made me sheepishly grin that I'd just ordered something that size. But it was delicious.  The food was uninspired, but then again, I think I should have gone with the server's recommendation. I had the meal with the various sausages and they didn't have enough flavor to my liking.   Hopefully coming here again and grabbing something else to eat will elevate my opinion a bit more. But for beer drinkers, this is definitely a nice place to sip on one.",

I honestly would have just been happy splitting one of their delicious pretzels.",

    "text": "\"... you go... I'm never leaving this place.\"  I'd like to say I rocked the Hofbrauhaus, but in truth, the haus rocked me.  The beer at Hofbrauhaus is flown in from Germany.  Their wheat beer is delicious and among one of the better I've tasted.  Like True German wheat beers, it is served sans fruit.  Huge steins of beer come as soon as you can order them.  The beer drinking ensues at your table and on-stage.  I was here during downtime in Las Vegas, Saturday at 2pm, so the place was far from packed.  The band was a husband-wife team and despite the fact that the beer hall was only sparsely populated, they performed like it was a full house.  With interactive songs that ranged from standing on your bench to pounding your stein on the table to the rhythm of the song, they constantly kept all patrons involved.  I could go on with some of the other tricks they have up their sleeves but I'll let you come here to see them for yourself.  Even after a tough session of playing trumpet and flugelhorn, they still make rounds of the hall and chat with you while taking slugs off their steins.  Both talkative and sapient about the tradition of the Hofbrauhaus, they're even willing to get a little personal.    I had to get them a round of apple schnapps shots before I left, it felt mandatory.",

    "text": "This place is truly awful.  As a Las Vegas local I felt compelled to join <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> to write this review.  Living in Las Vegas, I missed some of the small Midwestern German restaurants I used to frequent, so we went to Hofbrauhaus to try a little German food and beer.  Here's what we found:  *The beer was good, but $7.50 for a  1/2-liter?  Well- It is Vegas and they only have to get ya' once... but I'd MUCH rather spend $2 for a 23 oz. on-site microbrew at Ellis Island, and its less than 5 minutes away.  The place was half-full of European tourists - some of which thought $13.50 for a litre was a steal.  *They don't have a shot-ski (imagine a wooden ski with 5 shot glasses bolted down) or the stump (a great bar game involving a 4' stump, a square nail and a hammer) like they do at the Haufbrauhaus in other 'authentic' locations in the US!  *The hall is loud and echoey, but it's to be expected with 30' ceilings and tile floors.  The band is appreciated, but don't plan on carrying on a dinner conversation.  As for the meal...  *My girlfriend ordered the sauerkraut soup which she enjoyed and we we're then going to split an entree.  Then the 'sauerbraten' arrived:  $19 for 3 small pieces of dry, flavorless beef with bland brown gravy that tasted as if it was straight from a can.  There were two potatoe dumplings that tasted neither like potatoes nor dumplings.  They were ice-cream-scooped balls of gritty, mealy tastelessness covered with an unidentifiable blah crust.  Inedible.  A few pieces of over-cooked carrots and celery topped off this masterpiece.  It was truly the worst 'German-themed' (I won't call it German) food I've ever tasted.  I grew up in the restaurant business and eat dinner out 2-3 times/week.  I have never sent food back until this meal.  When we sent our food back the waitress was nice and we asked for her opinion of the food and she said that the owner had never let the servers try the food.  WHAT???  She said that she had tried a few things and didn't care for the food herself.  She told us that she had to get the manager to come to our table to take the meal off our bill and returned to collect the plate after a few minutes.  Expressing my opinion to the straight-from-Germany manager/owner was going to be the sweetest part of this meal, but our waitress returned with the bill sans the 'sauerbraten' and it was time to leave... We were getting hungry.",

Great food - we chose the appetizer sampler which included variety of sausages, sauerkraut, potato salad and pretzels.  Yum!  We also had apfelstrudel for dessert.  There was live entertainment and we were lucky enough to be there at the same time as a bachelor party which made the atmosphere at 2:00 in the afternoon very boisterous!  We totally enjoyed it and loved finding a place off the strip that was so fun and had good food, too.",

Germans in Vegas? kidding) sitting next to us said it wasn't like at home. (They didn't say that it was not as good, just not the same. Ha ha!) Yes, sitting next to us, because seating is beer hall style, at long tables, next to whoever you get planted next to. So if you don't have a big group, your are going to make some new friends.  So what he heck did those two Germans know, anyways? Well, more than me. Besides the food thing, then knew the words to the songs better than I did. At one point the band ... yes you could have guessed it, three guys in leiderhosen ... struck up the national anthem ... we all rose, put our hands over our hearts, and sang ... well the two Germans didn't but hey, it's not their anthem, right? Right after the anthem the band charged straight into John Denver, Johnny Cash, The Monkeys, and Neil Diamond I think. Everyone just kept singing, whether because of the mood or the beer or cause everyone else was. And that's where the two Germans put us to shame because they knew the words better.  The beer is good. And it comes in liter steins. Nuf said.  At to top it off, there's a beautiful blond walking around serving up Jagermeister shots and spankings with a large wooden paddle. (Just to be clear, the paddle was for the spankings ... the shots came from what looked like test tubes.) I don't know if this is a Bavarian thing or a Vegas thing (probably the latter), but it sure got the attention of the spectators and the participants (especially the latter).  Go there!",

I should have bought the plastic one!! The boot they sold us was flimsy and ended up breaking the first time that we set it on the table. It was absurd and even crazier is the waitress and then gift shop girl tried to tell me that I would have to buy a new boot. Obviously, that didn't happen. I kicked a fuss.. they gave me a replacement boot.. and I left in anger with an empty boot. This place may be okay, but I urge extreme caution because they're clearly very interested in extricating as many of your precious dollars from you as they can.",

This place gets loud and isn't really somewhere you go looking for a romantic candle lit dinner. But overall someplace you have to experience at least once. Try getting a shot of their German Apple Schnaups and you will get bent over your table for a paddling by your server along with your shot.. lol",

I have to say after visiting I was pretty pissed at my husband for not sharing this place and embracing his German heritage with us sooner.   I don't understand the complains of this spot.   We went on a Friday night, busy, rowdy, and lots of fun and music.   Can't wait to go back, and maybe skip the kids so we can drink up!   They spankings are hilarious, very brave souls, they appear brutal. Did witness's guy who got at least 3 spankings while we were there.  Overall a great place! Would definitely be taking our guest who visit here!!!",

Also the prices for Hofbrau branded merchandise is pretty reasonable compared to buying it at the original in Germany.",

The steins of beer are where it's at! The Beer is imported straight from Germany and the food is absolutely amazing! I ordered the hefewiezen from munchen. It was delicious and it's served in a True stein! The food is pretty good, I ordered the bratwurst plate.   The entertainment here can get a little wild and crazy! haha which makes the whole experience worth it. I really like the beer stein holding challenges they do here. Pretty fun to watch.

Our waitress was super nice and helped explain the menu to us as most of the items are in German. All of the food we ordered was amazing and very authentic. I especially liked the giant pretzel and all the great mustards that came with it. I am not a beer person usually, but their beer is SO good! If you are brave, order a stein of it!

Plus I'm not really a beer person. It was pretty empty, maybe because it was Sunday afternoon, I don't know. I would say about 3 rows of tables had people at them. Live entertainment was going on. It was hard for me to see unless I got up because of the huge pillars in the way of my view. The inside of this building is pretty plain unless you look up at the cool ceiling. You sit at wooden tables on benches. So if you need back support you might not want to come here. The servers have their themed outfits on. The girls in dresses and the guys in lederhosen shorts. Its cute, but you can tell the guys hate it. lol.  We ordered the giant pretzel. Soooo good!!! Comes with onion mustard, sweet mustard, and a chunky cold cheese. I liked the cheese and the sweet mustard best. He ordered the special pork roast which was the most tender and flavorful roast I've ever tasted. It came with mashed potatoes. I ordered the Jager Shnitzel sooooooooo good. I would suggest all of these to anyone who asked. I tried to eat it all lol and I was supper stuffed.  Our server was really nice and attentive. Actually everyone was nice and attentive. :) I will be back soon!!! Its also great for families. The people with kids, seemed like their kids were having a blast!!!",

Come here for the drinks and the atmosphere!  I'd recommend trying the Fresh Baked Pretzel to start. Love it! All the dipping sauces were great too...and this thing is huge!  Very sharable...  I've tried most of the Sausages, Potatoes, Spatzl and Sauerkraut. My favorites were definitely the sausages and potatoes!  They all have unique tastes...but no extraordinary items to touch base.  And definitely try their Hofbrauhaus Hefeweizen. It is outstanding!   To finish, we tried the Hofbrauhaus Sweet Platter: Kirschtort, Tiramisu & Cheesecake. They were all pretty good, and came with a melted creme cheese like sauce for dipping/pouring :)  Have fun!",

The concept is cool and it's probably an awesome place to have large get togethers and be loud. We enjoyed eating there with our 9 month old son because he wasn't loud considering how large the place was. His babbles were drowned out by others. The beer was typical of German beer - it was good! The food however left me disappointed. I would not recommend the schnitzel wiener art. It was really dry and I found myself dipping it in the cranberry sauce provided to add flavor. I would get one of the other schnitzels with sauce or gravy instead if I returned. The potato salad was pretty tasty though. My husband ordered a special which came with a few types of meat and he liked it. The biggest disappointment was the price of our food at lunch time ($19-20 for an entree). I know it's Vegas but I've had better German food for cheaper prices, especially at lunch.   If you're looking for a huge german dining hall, this is it. Good beer, fun crowd, just be careful what you order for food so you aren't disappointed.",

Besides the drinking, the food is nothing to get excited about. I'm personally not a big German food fan, so paying a high price for food I don't like isn't so appealing. I'm still shocked that a pretzel was $14. How much does it really cost to make a pretzel?! Yes it's large, but not big enough to justify the cost. And it tasted like every other pretzel. I tried one of the sausage dishes, and well, it tasted like sausage. Nothing special.   Bottom line, fun atmosphere, but I'll pass on the food.",

    "text": "Buy a spanking, get a free shot. Or is it the other way around.? This place is a replica of the famous Hofbrauhaus in Munich, but unlike many replicas here in Vegas, Hofbrauhaus was able to also bring the same atmosphere of the original Hofbrauhaus, Live German band playing classic German and American singalong songs, lots of beer, food and loud drunk customers having one hell of a time. This is definitely a great place for celebrations. Also, where else would you get spanked every time you have a shot of jager?... Here!...So I started with a shot of Jager. Now, the food is a different story, although people around me seemed to enjoy it, I'm not really a fan. I ordered the Hofbrauhaus wurstplatte, recommended by my Hispanic looking German waitress, she said it was one of the most popular dishes in the house and the menu says is for sausage lovers. ( I know, it doesn't sound right) it wasn't bad really but it wasn't good either, I wasn't impressed by it, I mean there was the \"wow\" factor but nothing to do with flavor...... So I ordered another shot of jager. (better sausages at Las Vegas grille and also less intimidating) Previously i had ordered the Bavarian appetizer, Obazda, now this is worth ordering again, it was really good. Brie prepared with cream cheese, butter, onions, served with a freshly baked pretzel...... and a shot of Jager. The beers are good of course, who doesn't like German beer? But they are a little bit pricey so we only had one 1 litter Oktoberfest beer each. WOW, when the waitress came back and sat the two beers on the table my friend and I looked at them and we were impressed of how huge they were! Wow! there's something worth coming back for! (by the way, the beers were also big) ....so I had a shot of Jager. For dessert I ordered the apfelstrudel which is their signature dessert and I loved it, accompanied with a shot of Jager is the best. I'm pretty sure I'll be back. Even though this place is a bit pricey and they seem to cater mostly to tourists, this is a good place for birthday parties and any kind of celebration or to bring friends from out of town. German music playing, beer drinking people singing and dancing, fun staff going around entertaining and serving happy customers, eating and huge (beers), shots of jager. I can definitely get used to all this.............spanking.",

It is not what you would normally expect. The Black Forest cake is very good and moist. The sauce is to die for. The Hofbrau beer is a True German beer that is not common to most restaurants. I would recommend this restaurant for anyone to visit. It is a good, close to authentic German meal.",

I did some research before going and found a dish, Octoberfest something, that seemed to have a sample of a lot of the things I wanted to try. When I told the server my order he told me that was too much food and I should pick something lighter. WTF. That's when things went south for me. I asked if there was a smaller dinner that still sampled these items, he said uhhhh and stared at the menu over my should for awhile. He then suggested a sausage sampler from the happy hour menu. Not exactly what I was looking for, so I shared a salad and giant soft with my husband. The soft pretzel was made in Munich and frozen and shipped there. Sure tasted like it was frozen, dry and flavorless, but the dipping sauces saved it. I didn't try any of my husbands sausage sampler, but he didn't even eat the white type because it tasted like dry hot dog. Well, one beer, a salad, soft pretzel, and happy hour sausage sampler came to $46. We could have had a nice dinner for that much. My main problem is being told I shouldn't order something. Also we didn't like what we did have. I've heard mixed reviews from friends, but now I know that it's more of a bar than dinner destination. Won't be returning here. On a side note their original beer is pretty good.",

I have been to Europe but never to Germany so I can't give one of those reviews on how authentic this place is.   The BEER OH the BEER! First of all, if you order anything less than 1 liter then you don't belong at the Hofbrauhaus. Depending on the type of beer each liter runs around $17. Sure it's pricey but you really are paying for the atmosphere and entertainment. The whole place is lined with long tables/benches which help create the ambiance of a German beer house.   A German band complete with tuba normally plays and encourages more drinking. My favorite is when they come around with the tuba and you must hurl your change into it's opening. So much fun with a beer in hand. The band plays traditional German music as well as the occasional cover song. Journey's \"Don't Stop Believing\" with tuba backup= Amazing!  You can volunteer (or a friend can volunteer you) to have your booty paddled by one of the many waitresses. I saw an old man get paddled the other night and thought he may have a heart attack. But he survived!!   The food is pretty descent but is pricey at about $18-$20/dish. I've ordered the traditional wienerschnitzel which is battered pork fried to crispy perfection. I normally don't get a full meal here since my friends and I mainly come here to drink. You can order a large pretzel with assorted mustards and cheese for less than 10 bucks. Also the fries with the cheese are a good beer-soaking snack.   All in all the Hofbrauhaus is a fun place to celebrate birthdays, bachelor parties, and I even saw a group celebrating their 40th high school reunion. Also it's just fun to drink and be belligerent where it is encouraged!",

The food was excellent, reminded me of the days of my youth when I lived in Deutchland for a few years.  The atmosphere was authentic German fest hall and the great beer just topped it all off.  The seating is communal around some large picnic tables.  We were sitting with a nice German family who were very nice but didn't sprecken sie English  Had the Currywurst for my dinner and it was super tasty.  The German family dining next to us was eating the schnitzel and it looked really good as well.  I had trouble making up my mind when it came time to order.  No such difficulty when it came time to order my beverage.  \"I'll have a liter of Hefe bitte\"  They also had a pretty good umpah band playing the night we were there, with all the authentic German beer fest tunes.  Sweet Caroline, Who the F is Alice and so on...    Would not hesitate to go back here the next time I find myself in Vegas.

However, Bavaria is not known for its culinary.  Don't get me wrong, the place is a unique experience: Loud music, Good beer and - if u are lucky, like I was - there will be a few groups of germans standing on the tables while singing and dancing and  you could also share one of the big tables with friendly, talkative bavarian folks.   When it comes to the food: try the brats. The variety is not vast, but they are tasty and a good side of Germany. And the pretzels worth the try too. Don't forget the mustard and the obazda sauce.   The service is not the strongest point: it took over 10 minutes to be greeted by anyone, another 10 minutes to get our beer and about half and hour to get the food. The wait wasn't bothering me much while my 1 liter beer was full and I was enjoining the music and the german bachelor party group next table, but then a sad thing happen: no one asked to refill our beers for the next hour, and when the server did, it took a while to come.   Don't get scared when the bill comes. Just the pretzel itself is about $ 12, the beer $ 15... so... expect to spend from $50-$100 a person.  FINAL SCORE:  FOOD: 3 stars SERVICE: 3 stars  AMBIENCE: 5 star",

The server came around once every 15 minutes; horrible service. I couldn't hear what anyone at the table was saying, including the person sitting right next to me. If I wanted to go to play drinking games and spend my night with loud obnoxious drunks, I would have stopped by UNLV and hung out at a frat house. At least I wouldn't have to pay $20 for a freaking hotdog.   Two stars because the beer was pretty good and the building looks cool.",

The red cabbage was like a sauerkraut made with red cabbage with some sugar and spice added. Interestingly tasty. Generous portions, friendly staff, great atmosphere. I would love to go back.  They had a live polka-style band. I was disappointed there was not a dance floor.  People in our party ordered sausages and a couple of the pork roast style dishes. Everyone enjoyed the food.   One draw back was the seating along the side of the room, where we were seated. The tables can fit up to 8+ people. If you're a party of 4 they will seat another party on the other end of the table which is pushed up against the wall. Which means if you're sitting on the outside you have to get up for the other diners or you have to wait for others to get out of your way if you're seated on the inside. This is okay if you like the other people seated at your table. But if you don't like their conversation or demeanor it could get unpleasant. So I recommend making reservations as I got the impression this was \"overflow\" seating. The rest of the seating areas had easy access to both ends of the table.  I didn't try the beer but the drinks menu also offered some interesting brandy and digestive choices.",

    "text": "Das boot!  Das boot!  (a.k.a. glass boot full of beer)  Hofbrauhaus is cheesy, it's a tourist trap, it's priced for out-of-towners (read: expensive).  That said, on a Friday night, it is one of the best places in town to go if you want an energetic crowd enjoying themselves and lots of good beer.    No, it's not a perfectly authentic German beer hall (then again, the Paris casino is not a perfect replica of French culture).  It's an impersonation.  A frat-boyish impersonation of a German beer hall.  Diners are seated on wooden benches at communal tables and served lots of beer (in massive, heavy mugs or an uber-expensive glass boot).  The polka band plays at night and sparks congo lines, drunken feats of strength and constant sing-alongs.  As for the negative reviews, I will agree that the food is mediocre, consisting mostly of fried meats or some form of sausage.  The prices are at ridiculous \"bilk the tourist\" levels.  That's why such a fun place only ranks at three stars for me.   But Hofbrauhaus isn't built to be a place you'd go on a regular basis.  It's built to throw a drunken party.  A party where you get intoxicated enough to forget how much you're paying.  If you go there, know what you're getting into.  It's loud.  Hella loud.  Fun loud.  Lose yourself loud.  And if you have a designated driver and no responsibilities in the morning, it's a great place to play tourist (i.e. bring a group for drunken antics and lose several years of emotional maturity).",

However, the food is overpriced, and the beer is uninteresting for a craft beer geek like myself.    We went to celebrate the departure of a coworker.  I had a glass of dunkel, and a glass of the lager.  The dunkel just didn't have enough flavor for me.  I preferred the lager.  I also had a $15 poached sausage.  For two sausages and a pretzel, it just wasn't worth it.  Sure, the imported mustard was good, but not worth the price.  In fact, for 14 people, our total bill was $750.    I think next time we will try to go somewhere worth that kind of money to spend.  It is a fun place, that is for sure.  You can buy a shot of Jagger, and you'll get spanked along with it.  All things considered though, I would just rather go somewhere else to drink beer and have a good time with friends.",

Being in a city with such amazing food options, we came here and I am not too thrilled when I reflect upon it.   I don't drink, so I was not enticed by the massive beers they give. The lemonade I had was horrible. I could taste the syrup and I felt as if I was drinking lemon flavored cough syrup. The food was heavy and not good by any means. I ordered a chicken sandwich, but I tried the more traditional meals my friends ordered. Not happy with either.   The only upside was the one man band and the occasional spankings when people would buy shots. My buddy was spanked really HARD and in some way I believe it was the universal paying him back for bringing me here.   Germans might make some cool looking cars, but I'm not impressed by the food. Maybe there is something better in Deutschland, but I have yet to try it.",

But if you are into the music near the band is where to be for singing along with the bands. Excellent selection of typical German dishes. There are enough selections that you can try something new each visit or try the combination plates. Start off with pretzels and beer. No military or senior discount but beer coupons are available at Nellis Air Force Base for active duty and retirees and those visiting Air Force personal from Germany, Italy, Belgium, UK, and other countries that come to Nellis for training. After a few beers invite the paddle girl over and have a shot of jagger and paddle on the butt just for the hell of it. If you have a birthday person have them get the paddle.",

    "text": "When Oktoberfest is done with and it's held in October, where can I get my fix of genuine and authentic german beer with shnitzel and a live band? Well here at Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas is the answer to my yearning question. Not to mention the hot bavairan waitresses at your service. There is a live band that performs here at the Hofbrauhaus on a daily basis. I haven't come here for lunch, but it's always oktoberfest when I come here for dinner. The food ranges from shnitzel to sausages. If you have not the apetite to eat like a Bavarian, there are some side dishes such as french fries and pretzels. The pretzel is also the symbol of eating like a Bavarian. It goes well with the beer as well. If you want something sweet, you can also order there \"biker beer\" The biker beer consists of beer mixed in with sierra mist. Back when I started drinking beer at the age of 26... i wasn't into the whole beer scene, so biker beer did it for me. Yet, as my love grew for the taste of lager... I need to get straight 1 liter of german lager. You don't have to order food to enjoy live entertainment. Some couples just order the beer. But to experience True Bavarian food that you won't be able to experience elsewhere, you should try shnitzel art. If shnitzel is not your thang, than try the bavarian sausages sampler. Its good to drink some soup, too. I would suggest the goulash. For an appetizer, I would suggest the bavarian pretzel. And as for the dessert... I would definitely say get the strudel! You can never go wrong ordering the essentials that I have recommended. Go for it! Enjoy!",

Yes, you heard that right. There are German Mistresses here with paddles, like those wooden ones you see that were meant spanking school girls. The mistresses wear the same exact uniform as the rest of the front staff, so I don't know if SHE was gonna spank me, the HOST was gonna spank me, or the BARTENDER was gonna grab the paddle and get wild on me.  So I asked the guy serving me food and drink, \"Is it normal?\", and he told me it's somehow related to taking shots of Jagermeister that involves being paddled.   Note to newcomers, never, ever, order a shot of Jager unless you are expecting some random female to grab a paddle and start paddling your ass away!",

I was amazed at how many German places I saw around Vegas! Especially since the town is not the biggest. I actually got to try two places and one of them was the fabulous Hofbrahaus!  I know that German food is not one of the most well known cuisines in the world since it is so simple but if you get to try it you will see there is True beauty in its simplicity!  To start with Hofbrauhaus is beautiful inside and out. The building looks like traditional German architecture on the outside and inside. The ceilings are high and they are painted really nicely. They have a stage for live bands too! Seating is on large tables with benches just like you would expect in a Munich beer hall!  My BF and I came here on our last day in Vegas and I decided to treat him with the money I got from the machines!  What is really cool, and even impressive is that some of the food items are actually flown in from Germany!!!! We had a large freshly flown in pretzel to start with and we found out that the red cabbage, bratwurst and sauerkraut are also flown in!!!! We had the veal bratwurst, the chicken bratwurst and two beers. Mine was a incredibly good special seasonal beer! We also tried the apple strudel which was also flown in! Everything was seriously very tasty!  This review, of course, is not truly complete since I did not get to be here during Oktoberfest! The ambience here must be truly incredible when it is that time of year! However, if this place gets five stars without all the excitement of Oktoberfest - it truly must be good and, trust me it is  Service was pretty good! While you wait they give you interesting little newspapers with all kinds of information about the restaurant and its events. Next time we come I will make sure we get to check out one of the live bands! Expect to spend a great deal of what you win at the machines haha! This place is not cheap! I shelled out about $90 for two with tip included!  Parking is no problem as you would expect in most places in Vegas! There is a large lot adjacent to the restaurant.",

Our waitress was SO inattentive, she said that \"the kitchen lost our ticket\" for food after us being there for over 30 minutes at that point.  This is something she should have noticed WAY before that considering I had ordered a side salad, and that should have been up right away.  She dropped our food on the ground, she gave attitude about EVERYTHING.  She wasn't paying attention to us at.all.  We needed to flag her down for everything, and when our order finally did come out, it was wrong.  Oh, and she came running after us after we left because she couldn't find the bill on the table and thought we didn't pay her.  Ummm, it's the black thing RIGHT THERE.    But they have giant beers and really good music.  But that doesn't make up for the fact that the service was some of the worst I have ever had!",

    "text": "More Vegas festivities were held at Hofbrauhaus, a fine purveyor of beer, Germanium grub, and raucous entertainment. We made a reservation for eight of us the same day, and managed to snag a table with ease. Once there I realized we got the worst possible location, for me at least; it was about 5' away from the stage, band, and a large party of drunken, table-dancing idiots.   So after a couple glasses of brew; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA?select=34IhW9hzUkABuxD5YNtK8Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWb...</a>  A couple snacks; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA?select=OknYYAs9YJyO47jKVgMpmw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWb...</a>  We moved our party \"outside\" to the fake courtyard, where we could hear ourselves talk. The calm area was nice and had a painted ceiling to give the illusion of the outdoors. There were TVs to show the shenanigans of the belly of the beast, as well as a Jagermeister shot toting dominatrix, trading paddle driven ass smacks and shots for a few bucks.   I wasn't expecting much from the food, but most of it was pretty good and fairly priced. All the sausages I tried were good and I ended up wishing I got a sausage platter instead of the large fried pork cutlet; <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWbbvGmyhFiBpG_5hf5LA?select=3kbIc_2631KF0YxhUkPQfA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/cJWb...</a>  All in all it was a fun time. If I went back, I would request a table as far from the stage a possible, but I'm old and don't like loud things anymore.",

    "text": "This place was really fun!  All of the other reviewers are right, it is a bit expensive.  Good thing we decided to go for my birthday, which excuses the cost!  We spent $123 with tip but we got a 3 course meal; pretzel, 2 liter glasses of beer, the weinerschniztel plate (the only good one was the chicken sausage!) and then the pork plate with mushroom sauce and spatzel (sp?).  We also got a dessert sampler with bread pudding, apricot strudel and the hot raspberries with vanilla ice cream.  The large beers are the equivalent of two pints, meaning even at $14.50 it's still better than the normal $8 per beer Vegas pricing.  The hefeweisen was really good; not as tasty as my normal Weihenstephaner, but still very good.    We ended up sitting in the mock \"outdoor\" beer garden since we didn't have a reservation.  It was still great!  It's so airy and open, if you don't look directly at the fake sky on the ceiling you could actually believe that you're outside in a place with nice weather (aka not Vegas!).  It's also a bit quieter than inside, but we didn't really care.    On our way out, they were doing a contest to see which out of 10 women could drink their beer the fastest, with the prize being a beer stein. Of course, I didn't win but it was still very fun!  While we were there they also had a girl sitting on top of one of the horns while the guy was playing it... hilarious!!  Overall, we will definitely go back... but this time with more than just the two of us and we'll make a reservation so we can sit in the beer hall!",

There is always live music to add to the atmosphere. Waitresses walk around offering shots of jaeger, but they come with a spanking. This is a fun and entertaining tradition, especially when you buy spankings, er I mean shots, for your friends.   The food is delicious and so is the bier, but the prices are little more than what I pay normally. BUT I do try to temper that knowing that we are in Vegas and everything costs more (even though it did not used to be like that).   If you like German food, bier, music, and atmosphere this is a GREAT night out in Vegas before heading out to party more. I highly recommend.",

Having been to the actual Munchen Hofbrauhaus and I can tell you the decor is quite similar. Big long oak tables, a boisterous band of German singers, and more beer than you should be drinking.   The food while not absolutely authentic \"best German food ever\", I do think that it provides enough of an idea of what German food looks and tastes like for the curious patron.   This particular night that I went, the \"haus\" had a really fun young band of German singers who really knew how to get the crowd into the night. There was drinking songs, blowing the alpine horn game, and drunken dancing. What else do you want from a German restaurant?  The one problem with Hofbrauhaus is the fact that its more like a \"tourist spot\". You just go there not for the food, but for the experience and the \"I just went to Germany feeling\". While I recommend everyone to go once. Going on a regular basis probably means you don't care about money, or you're an alcoholic.  Try it once, order the Leiberkase (don't ask me what it is) and enjoy!",

    "text": "Ever since our first Oktoberfest experience in Munich, Germany, we have been coming to Hofbrauhaus for 11 years, and always have had wonderful service, wonderful food, and a wonderful time.  BUT not this time!  Normally I would rate it 5 stars, but this visit rates 2 stars at the most.  We visited on Dec. 28th, so it's in between Christmas and New Years.  We were there at night for dinner.  It really wasn't  busy at all, and there were many empty tables.  We were seated all the way in the back as we wanted a view of the band (which wasn't very good that night either).  We were waiting and waiting and waiting and waiting and WAITING for someone to at the very least take our beer order!  My husband had to get up and go to the front desk to ask them to PLEASE send someone to our table and help us.  Someone finally came to us and it may have been one of the managers.  She said that they had a large party over there (?!?) to explain the delay.  Whatever.  Like I said, it didn't seem very busy.  We've seen that place filled in the past.  She sent over a complimentary pretzel.  OK (more about that later).   A server came over to take our order.  We ordered full Bavarian style dinners.  Our dinners finally arrived.  Someone else brought the food to our table. He mumbled the names of the dishes.   I had forgotten the German name for my dinner order, but what was on my plate didn't quite fit the description.  So, another server came around and asked us what we had ordered.  Mine was supposed to be half pork roast and half sauerbraten.  I had my husband's dish and he had mine.  We finally got those switched.  The dinners were awful!  I have had Sauerbraten there for years, and that piece of meat was tough and flavorless.  The pork roast was very bland.  My husband ordered one of the \"special dinners\".  It was pork roast as well.  He said it had no flavor either.  Sauce was so so.  We do enjoy German food, and have had much better food served to us at Hofbrauhaus LV prior to our recent visit!  SO WE HOPE THIS IS NOT A NEW TREND FOR A DECLINE IN SERVICE AND FOOD QUALITY.  One last comment about that pretzel:  We took a photo of our steins of beers and the pretzel  right after they were served to us and posted it on one of our Facebook pages right away.  Then we immediately received a comment back about the photo from one of our \"friends\".  She commented:  \"Half of the salt on the pretzel is missing!\"  (It was a little odd looking; like a few sections were rough and not evenly baked and browned like most pretzels are.)  I truly hope that this whole experience was a FLUKE.  We always look forward to our visits of Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas.   We were very disappointed this time.",

I have always wanted to go to the Hofbrauhaus and so when we were over we had to stop in.  We sat down at the bar they have outside the restaurant and he got the hefeweizen and I just got their lager.  I loved the baby mug (10oz or .3L) that I got.  I have to go back one day after work and buy like 2 of them.  I have issues with these baby mugs!  The lager was good and light but I taste the hefeweizen and about had a heart attack!  It was the best hefeweizen I have ever tasted.  My boyfriend was going over the food and was drooling.  He hasn't had German food since he was there so we made reservations to come back that night.  We came back at 7pm and were seated right away.  Ordered each of us a liter of hefeweizen and pretzel and brie cheese app.  OMG the brie cheese concoction, delicious!!!  I just wanted to eat it alone it was sooooo good.  We shared the 3 different sausage plate which came with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  We also ordered potato salad.  German potato salad is different, more vinegar, but still yummy.  The sausage was good too, one was my favorite but don't remember what was in it.  The food came out fast and the waitress are friendly even with crazy drunks around.  While we were eating they had a band playing traditional German music and also some American.  They had girls going around spanking people, had a beer holding contest (1 Liter, not easy) and just a great time.  We have plans to go back again!!!  I need some hefeweizen!!!",

I know that to most that is the charm of the place, its authenticity, German food, music, etc. and what did I expect of a place called Hofbrauhaus! But, I couldn't overcome my English squeamishness about Germanic culture! Yes, the beer was cold and tasty, although the selection was limited to 3 choices. Food was ok, plain and filling. The band was very pleasant and eager to entertain. Some of the band members were so young they couldn't even drink beer (at least not in the US). The crowd was not too into the music so it was a pretty subdued atmosphere. So, go here if you are really into German food and culture otherwise go somewhere else. Should have gone to Crown & Anchor instead!!",

Service is very attentive, but not obtrusive.  What I'm not so happy about is the volume level (hard surfaces + amplified performers + crowd = noisy.) While I appreciate the authentic music, the routines can be disruptive.  It's a long walk from the Strip, but definitely worth a cab ride if you like beer!",

    "text": "Food FAIL. Bartender FAIL. Entertainment - eh.  The only reason I came here was because our friend coordinated our group of 25 and this venue accommodates larger parties because of their bench style seating. However, the food is mediocre and overpriced, the service was just okay, and the sound system was poorly monitored and difficult to hear what the emcee was saying during their random contests.   First I arrived early hoping to catch a hockey game at the bar. I called ahead and a host said there were two screens and it looked like one was showing hockey. Joe the bartender was thoroughly inattentive, slow at pouring (hampered by bottle regulators), and indifferent to my needs. He never said hello when I sat down, never offered a menu or drink list. They only have 3 types of beers, and you can only get certain beers in certain sizes. After 10-15 minutes of waiting, Joe tried searching for the game but it was very clear that he had little experience with a remote control or his bar's service.  Plus having only one bartender at 7pm on a Saturday night didn't help him either. They use Dish service and couldn't find the game. Bar FAIL.  They sat us in the main hall near the band and the band was okay. But why had a drum set on stage if you're not going to have a drummer? Band FAIL. I could barely understand the emcee when he spoke because of either the acoustics of the room or the mic or where we were seated but it just made for a noisy atmosphere.  They've got a gal that walks around selling shots of Jager and paddle whacks on the ass. Having never been in a fraternity, I can't see how either of those can be pleasurable in any way. Plus, this lady was pissed about something someone said or did because she was putting out a really angry vibe to a couple of other guests not at our party.   I don't eat pork so my menu selections were limited. I went for the chicken with mushrooms. Good mushroom sauce, but the chicken was horribly overcooked and tough. Then it was topped with French's onions and came with their German pasta side dish. This was NOT worth $19. Food FAIL.  Not recommended for visitors. There's plenty better food & dining in Vegas.",

I have been told that it is pretty lively in October so I have to go there in October somehow.    There are a few drawbacks to it.   #1.  It's outside the strip, it's like right across from Hard Rock Hotel (Do you see a growing theme of me making lists) #2 If you don't have a car, I have to walk drunk all the way to the Hard Rock Hotel. #3 I got spanked by a wooden panel at the Hofbrauhaus.   Now that I have your attention again and away from me complaining about how far it is from the strip. Let me explain the spanking.   Apparently one of my friends who has been there knew that if you get a shot you get spanked.  My friend asked me if I wanted a shot, to my surprise I was like \"SURRRE!!!!!!\"   My shot comes out and it's in a wooden paddle that has holes in it for the shots to fit in.  I didn't think anything less of it.   So I have my shot of Jager and then the waitress tells me to come over and bend over.  Apparently I will get spanked by her with the paddle.   Now let me say that this chick didn't go easy on me and gave me such a hard spanking that the fat of my butt cheeks went through the holes of the paddle.  I was jumping up and down in pain.    It actually hurt sitting down after that.  I was humiliated, there are pictures somewhere out there of that event and I will get my revenge on that waitress and friends.    In conclusion if you want to impose pain to a friend please take them here.   P.S. they have a lot of beer apparently that you can drink in a 1 liter Stein.",

So, I'm realistic and I know this is Vegas..........granted, the food at Hofbrauhaus has never been German.  The music....not German.  The atmosphere....not even remotely close to a German Festhaus.  What was originally a pretty fun and laid-back beer spot has become another avenue for ridiculous frat parties and bachelorette night-outs.  Besides the fact the music is turned up to 11, for the price of a shot you can get your ass paddled by a \"woman\" who probably has a Y chromosome in addition to being 7 feet tall.    If you want a more authentically German experience, it would be more fun to drive 1200 miles to San Antonio.....yes, San Antonio.........and sample real German fare in Gruene, Pflugerville, Boerne, or Fredricksburg, TX.  That's right....you read that correctly.  Otherwise, if you prefer to hang out here have fun with Helga the Dominatrix and all the other waitresses that make Betty White look like Kate Upton.

The only (and perhaps most important) noteworthy offering was their beer selection.  It was all authentic, fresh, delicious, and served in the proper glasses.  The pretzel was authentic tasting but rather stale (i.e, at least a day old), which is inexcusable.   Furthermore, we had to pay an extra $2 for \"authentic Bavarian\" mustards (sweet and spicy).  Neither was remotely German.  In fact, I saw them use Gulden's for the spicy mustard.  Big, early fail in my book.     The Kasespatzle was mediocre at best.  Very dry and starchy.  The Schweinsbraten lacked the typical richness in both meat and beer sauce, and also tasted about a day old, or as if it came from a cheap buffet steamer tray.  The lentil/sausage soup was quite authentic and rich tasting, but that dish considerably less difficult to mess up.  Ambiance in the bier hall was extremely jovial and loud, making it hard to order or talk - which is expected and entirely OK.  Definitely one of the least enjoyable German dining experiences in the US.",

For the price I was hoping for the best damn schnitzel in town. Didn't happen. I've had plates that tasted like they were ready for hours, sitting under heat lamps.  The beer is good but extremely expensive. I will admit there's something about holding the big liter stein that feels perfect. Just not for the price.  The staff has been somewhat unfriendly. I realize they get busy and the place gets packed. I've felt ignored and they have charged me for more than i ordered multiple times. They have however, got my order right every time. I find that impressive with the amount of customers.  Even with all this, I enjoy when they have live polka/German bands, beer games, and celebrity keg taps. It is the best place to go for the German experience in Vegas.   If your willing to fork out the extra cash, this is a great place to drink some authentic German bier. I'd recommend stopping somewhere else for a couple local priced beverages first though.",

    "text": "I organized our corporate group of appx 45 to come here for a dinner while we were in Vegas last week for a staff retreat. I am so glad we did because we all had a fantastic time!  From the very beginning my experience was a pleasant one. Jennifer in the corporate sales office was extremely helpful in explaining the different dinner options that would work for our group and I felt that our meal options would be able to satisfy the many different dietary needs and restrictions we had in our group.  The process of booking our meal was super simple and stress free. With all the details I had to juggle during our retreat it was nice to have this task be such a simple one!  We even  had to adjust our dinner time last minute and that was no issue at all.  When our group started to arrive the evening of we were set up out back in the beer garden and had designated servers per each of our large tables to wait on us. Within minutes the manager on duty (he might have been the general manager now that I think about it) came back to speak with me and welcome our group which I thought was a sure sign we had picked a great place to dine.  Everyone was so friendly and you could tell that the staff enjoyed their job.  At such a \"novelty\" restaurant as a German festhaus this is really important.  When customers come in to dine they are coming in for having a great wait staff really adds to the whole experience. These folks were just SO NICE....it was awesome!  Our group was large and drank A LOT but the folks who waited on us -- the servers and bussers -- never acted like it was an inconvenience for us to have a cash bar or for everyone to spend so much time changing their minds.  We also added to our banquet order additional food items for the tables and even that was a simple request.  It's easy to say that the folks here know how to take care of their customers.  At the end of our long meal we ended up nixing the separate drink orders and paying on just one tab--the head waitress showed me our bills and the additional charges and I was appreciative of the fact that paying the tab was so easy.    At first we were somewhat bummed that our group was sat in the back away from the band and \"indoor\" entertainment but by the end of the meal we were so happy to have had the whole beer garden to ourselves. The food was delicious -- even if we couldn't finish our dessert trays--and we all had plenty to drink that I think everyone left full and buzzed :)  Before we left the general manager came over again to thank us for having our dinner there--such nice service!--and I have to say that if we come back to Vegas in the future I will make sure we eat here again.   Why go elsewhere when you have such a great experience ?",

Awesome entertainment in the form of German band, host with the most, paddling on the butt, beer drinking contest, etc!!!  I have been here several times, and have never been disappointed. If you are looking for a fun, casual and random night out, do try this little gem! It is especially fun on Saturdays, as they pull out all the stops with their live entertainment, that often includes getting patrons off their butts and on tables and chairs singing together while waving their steins. The food is enjoyable and hearty and the beers are great! I'm obviously not German so I can't say how authentic the food is, but i still think it's yummy. This place is obviously full of cliches and is most likely not what the real Munich is like, but all that matters to me is that I always leave smiling from ear to ear.   I actually booked a few tables here for about  thirty five guests the night before my wedding. The staff took great care of us. My friends loved all the excitement and the preselected catered orders were a feast. Totally worth the money! Many of my friends have gone on to take their friends and spread the word on this place. Btw, do buy a shot, but if you do, be aware that the skinniest waitresses usually paddle the hardiest!",

Some of the noise and electricity comes from the German stay band and singalong a they ensure. The other noise comes from the excitement of the employees as they try to evoke a party atmosphere.  The food is as authentic as the environment with items like Schnitzel and sauerkraut and German sausage. Even the German beer was fantastic.   Abut pricy but so good.",

    "text": "I'm not a huge fan of the food at the Hofbrauhaus, but it has the best beer in town and an atmosphere that can't be duplicated. (Unless, perhaps, you're in Bavaria. And even there, I doubt you'll hear a guy mixing traditional German songs with reggae and the \"Hogan's Heroes\" theme song.)  My husband and I met some friends for lunch on a Saturday. We arrived at noon, and the place was nearly empty. By the time we left at 1:30, however, the place was rocking, no doubt due to the entertainment (a one-man band) that began at 1. It was also extremely loud, so if you're looking to have an intimate meal, this is NOT your place! If you're looking for a good, raucous time, give the Haus a whirl.  As I said, the food is not the draw here; it's the beer. We each had a liter of the Oktoberfest, which is a nice, smooth lager. As much a I enjoyed this seasonal offering (and it was the main reason we all decided to meet here for lunch), I was craving the Hofbrau Original, so I got myself a 0.5-liter mug as well. So tasty! And so pricey -- $17 for the Oktoberfest, and $8 for the Original. (Hey, I said it was tasty. I didn't say it was cheap!)  My friends split a jumbo pretzel, complete with sides of mustard, cheese spread, and liver pate. At around $17.50, this was one expensive appetizer. Although they enjoyed their app, my husband and I skipped straight to the entrees. I had the beer sausage (a bratwurst), which was on \"special\" for $16, and he had his old standby, the leberkase, which is like an upscale grilled Spam loaf. (Sounds bad, but it's oh so good.) My friends had the beer sausage and the giant bratwurst sandwich, and they split of piece of Black Forest cake for dessert. Total damage for lunch (pre-tip): $190. Eek!  There are two dining rooms in the building, and we've sat in both of them. On this occasion, the smaller, indoor beer garden was closed, so we sat in the large beer hall up front. There's usually some sort of entertainment going on, and at night this place can get REALLY loud -- especially during the popular keg-tapping events. So be forewarned. And you'll probably drop a lot of money, if our lunch bill is any indication. But if you're in the mood for a semi-authentic German experience (albeit by Vegas standards), the Hofbrauhaus is the place to go.",

I ordered the pork roast, and it was tender, juice, not too much flavored.  The pretzel was a hit for our big party with bunch of kids. The sausage was bland.  The cheese plate got some complements from our friends. The spanking in the butts were quite famous here.  Each table got at least one spanking.  So be prepared to feel the pressure to get one if you come here.  It was fun though.  We asked our friend if it hurted, he said \"not bad\"... You should come here to check it out once, listen to loud music, get spanked, got to know what Octoberfest is about, but that's about it. I wouldn't come back here again.",

    "text": "Pretty cool place, especially if you are a beer lover. I am not, but I did enjoy myself. It models itself on a German beer garden. There is a huge indoor area that has long benches where you sit and eat and drink. Also, what looks like an \"outdoor\" garden, to do the same I assume. They offer 2 kinds of beer. I went with the lager. It was pretty tasty. Again, I am NOT a beer drinker.  The food was decent. I ordered some snitzel with swiss cheese. They do have 2 (?) vegetarian options, and this was one of them. It was good, but not great. I was here with Ife, Anthony and David, so it was a great time. But I am not sure this would be a place I would frequent. Personally, I think the prices are too high.  Service was good, although can border on slow.",

The Las Vegas location is a lot bigger and not as quaint as Miami, I like the more nostalgic era.   Our visit to the Las Vegas was nice, we came in as Walk In and was seated right away. I really wanted to have the Pork Knuckles, but it was a specialty item that they only serve when it was ordered. I was devastated! But I quickly recovered trying to pick the very next best thing....   The Bavarian Potato Soup- Like a loaded baked potato soup minus bacon, but adding their smoked sausage. It was topped off with croutons and chives.   Sauerbraten- Bavarian style potroast w/red wine. It was good, not as tender as I thought it would be, sauce was dark a bit on salty side which went well with the roast and spatzle. Yes spatzle! They look like gnocci pieces, but its noodles! Love them.   Red Cabbage- Wasnt a fan, I tried it, tasted like caramelized overly sweet and vinegar red cabbage. I guess this is the Bavarian version of our American cranberry to Turkey dinner.   Through our meal, there was a band playing and shouting out and drinking! It was Classic! Love it!    Yes and the dessert! I had to get Apfelstrudel! Apple strudel! It was great! Had to wait for my chantilly cream which made me think about the movie Inglorious Bastard with Hans Landa and the cream for apple strudel.... Reminiscing... It was great, wished the Pork Knuckle was available for us, that was the only reason I would go back for..  Thanks and good vibes!",

OK these aren't soft whacks these are home run hitting whacks. Be a good sport and TAKE IT!!!  When you enter the building you wait in relaxing lobby area where there's a very nice wooden bar with selves filled glass mugs and a fridge filled with beer bottles and kegs, the small ones. There's even a gift shop. Now when youre ready to go in the doors open up and there's a loud roar of craziness. People shouting, cheering, singing, dancing, and laughing. Glass mugs were all up in the air. The whole atmosphere felt like the movie Beerfest but without the teams and Miss Yeast. You sit at these large wooden table that probably fit 20. You order beer served in a 1 liter glass mugs, a plastic shoe, or a smaller glass cup. You order shots from your server and they bring them out in a wooden stick,  very nice looking but watch out cause that stick duals as a whacking paddle. There's also another girl dressed in black going around serving shots in test tubes, she'll really whack you. There's a guy going round looking for girls to hold his very long horn while he plays it. There's a few guys up in the front leading the cheers.  Drinks aren't cheap and food is reasonably priced. Their giant pretzels weren't that giant but came with cheese, mustard, and another dipping sauce. I saw some plates of cutlet and sausages looked nice in portions. Located across the Hard Rock Hotel on Harmon and Paradise, a busy and dangerous intersection for people who stumble out so watch out for your friends. Gather up a dozen or so people and have good time, make new friends there. We need a Yelp event here LOL.",

We had a blonde waitress with alot of black eye makeup(can't remember the name) she ignored us for quite some time. She finally took out drink order after apologizing that she was very busy. Lol. (OK I tried to understand) but my bill was 102. Dollars and I think I deserved good service.. She never asked if we wanted water or how our food was. She didn't know the menu at all(I won't even elaborate on this)  The large beers looks amazing.. well!!! Nope!! They we served almost room temp. Mugs not even chilled . There's a few that walk around with shirts. Specifically saying they are there for quest services. And he ignored us a 's well.  Whoever the manager is !! Really needs to be more proactive and start out by training the servers !. The food was below average, I opted for one of the vegan dishes and it was dry, over cooked and no real flavor. Hubby got the sausages which were ok. But still they seemed to sit out too long all were not juicy. The band was a fun experience!! Although the tip jar was pushed in our face the entire time.  It was a funny experience. And worth talking about.  But as for my stomach and the food. Nonway!! And the horrible service really makes me never want to recommend this place.. If you just want to see people take shots and get spanked!! And u want to drink warm beer and hear Oktoberfest Style music then definitely go just for that but don't go there looking for good customer service and quality food at all",

My family would come here for dinner and always have a good time. So, I chose this place for a work event. We had 350 attendees and reserving the Biergarten through Karen was easy-breezy. Our numbers kept changing but it wasn't a problem. We were well taken care of and everyone had fun. The service was outstanding. We had so much food that we had to take food home.  I personally like their schnitzel and spatzl...and of course their lager and hefeweizen. For dessert, I like their Kirschtort (Black Forest cake).  Take a shot of Jaegermeister and get paddled in public. Good times! Consider the following before setting up an event/ having a huge group here as there are fees if you: use their microphone, bring balloons, put an announcement/marquis, etc.",

    "text": "I did not enjoy the Hofbrauhaus.  I thought it was one of the most overrated, Vegas restaurants in the area.  It was so touristy that I was instantly turned off.  The wait staff all had tradition German clothing and tried to bring about a German vibe, including the German music and the bench seating.  The food was likewise subpar, even for simple things like a sausage or pretzel.    I usually like beer gardens, but there was nothing here to entice me.  I also really love beer, so I know Hofbrau as a legitimate beer brand in Germany, but the prices are astronomical, even for Las Vegas standards.  At about $9 for a pint, of honestly an average German beer brand, this place missed on so many aspects.  I have been to Germany and been to Oktoberfest and been to the Hofbrau tent, and this is such a bad interpretation of that.  If you really want Hofbrau beer, go to a liquor store (it is readily available in the area for about $10 a six pack) or go to a legitimate beer bar.  They will have better options of German beer, better food, and no cheesy, German atmosphere.",

A few friends and family had told me some about it so I had an idea of what is was going to be or what to expect.      Well to be honest i was not very impressed, Its very loud inside, the hall they seat you in amplifies everything. It makes it very hard to hear the people your with let alone your server. The live band was not very good at all. maybe they had to many beers by the time we got there. Its way to open for my liking, I like the concept of long tables and you set with others. The room size is just not appealing.      I will say the food was very good but the menu is very limited compared to others I have visited. Mostly sausages with a few pork and beef options. I guess for a Vegas thing its a place to visit but as a local, its nothing really special.      It was very clean, the staff is very friendly and if you order a shot you can get spanked. This is the kind of place you gather up your trade show buddies and make a night of it drinking and getting spanked.      Its worth checking out but to me it lacks way to much for me to want to go back.",

It is a breaded meat served with mashed potatoes and gravy which was really good. It came with a cucumber potato salad which was a little different for me.  I think if I had it more I would acquire more of a taste for it. The pretzel came with cheese, brown mustard and a sweet mustard which I preferred. Had one of the seasonal beers which was real big and filling. Overall a great meal and will be coming back. Make sure you bring an appetite when you walk through the door.",

Well me and a friend were in Vegas for short weekend getaway from LA and on our first night we decided to go across the street from our hotel (HardRock) and check this place out. Mainly because he is more of a beer guy and big German culture fan. Anyways we got here around 7:15 or so on a Thursday night and it was somewhat busy but at the same time kinda low energyish and meh. Again your in Vegas so don't expect to find a super big German area like Alpine village so go figure lol. We had a sausage platter sampler thing and it was pretty good as well as a few beers and just enjoyed and kinda relaxed while listening to live music and enjoying some people watching. All in all it was ok not the best but cant complain too much either. The sound system ,I will say, is not the best kinda off balanced and somewhat all over the place half of the time you don't know if they are speaking or singing in English, German or just hard to understand muffled something because yea the sound system is not the best. If I was in the area and just wanted sit around drink beers and enjoy somewhat of a German American ambiance I would defiantly think about coming here again. But if your not particularly a beer person or a fan of uncomfortable seating then maybe pass on this place blah.",

One of our friends was celebrating his birthday and chose to go here. I was genuinely excited about it. We showed up and the place looked cool. The music was alright and the atmosphere seemed nice. I am a bit of a beer snob so u was very excited to try a variety of German beer.  They offer 3 choices..... 3 lame ass choices. It's either a light, dark or a hefenweizen(sp). I love dark beer so I ordered that one. At 15 bucks a beer the size of it was beautiful. Large manly glass. The taste on the other hand sucked! I would have paid  maybe 7 bucks tops for it. It wasn't complete crap but I expected better. I ordered a plate consisting of two white sausages and a Bavarian pretzel. Knowing a little about German culture I was expecting manly sized portions. Boy was I wrong. I received two tiny sausages. The average bratwurst one buys at a local grocery store dwarfs these lame tiny links. The taste was okay but nothing special at all. At least I had my fresh Bavarian pretzel to look forward too. Wrong again! It was a decent size but it tasted like it had been sitting in a freezer all week long and had just been popped into a microwave for a minute before being served. I was expecting a large warm fresh soft pretzel. I received a room temperature, stale pretzel that tasted like crap.pretzel time or auntie m's would destroy this place in a pretzel competition. Over all, I am never going back to this sad excuse for a restaurant. If I want good food and beer I'm going to the Chicago brewing company. I feel that real German people would be ashamed of this place.",

Unfortunately, I don't drink, so I was very much sober and aware of what shortcomings the place had.   Drunk or not, there is no denying that this is a fun atmosphere. You won't see anyone at this place not having a good time. Food is surprisingly good, too. All right, I got that out of the way. Don't expect to be able to hold a conversation with all the noise going on, though.  Sadly, it ends there. First and foremost, the service is TERRIBLE. The servers only visit your table every once in a while. Granted, the place usually IS busy, but why not just hire more staff? They clearly are understaffed to accommodate the numbers of people they get in there.  On top of that, the staff are RUDE. The woman waiting on us last time (I believe her name was Maria) WOULD NOT LET ME ORDER OFF OF THE KIDS MENU. She gave me a rude, blank look and just bluntly said I couldn't. I've been to countless restaurants, fast-food and dine-in alike, and this is the only time this has ever happened. I can't always eat the full amount of food in an entree, and this is completely unforgivable that we would receive this kind of treatment. When I come into a place and my party spends $600+, I not only expect no disputes like this, I expect my ass to be kissed.   And if that remark in the last paragraph didn't already tell you, it's EXPENSIVE. Granted, my party consumed a LOT of alcohol, but ANY other place would have been cheaper than this for a similar purpose.  If you want to go out and have a drunken, fun evening with friends, this is the place for you - go for it. Just be prepared to deal with high prices and rude staff that think of themselves more as party planners than servers.  Food: C- Service: D- Atmosphere: D+",

ALWAYS get the Jumbo Complete. Don't pass it up. It's basically a large pretzel with cheese and mustard. Great appetizer, but sometimes I need more than one.  Have a good time, swing your glasses and dance all you like.",

    "text": "5 Stars, this place is a pure masterclass of beer perfection.  It's in Las Vegas and serves as the sister of the infamous Bavarian beer hall (which I have visited on three separate trips).  The main detractor for this place would have to be the prices for the beer which can get pricey if you have a high tolerance or are just extremely thirsty.  I haven't eaten at this particular branch of the Hofbrau but I'm sure the food is tasty and includes an array of German favorites including bratwurst and pretzels.  They have three signature beers which are served on tap-Original, which is a golden lager, Dunkel, which is a dark hoppy beer and a Hefeweizen.  I have had the original and dunkel time and time again, and they never fail to amaze me.  If you enjoy your beer and like a good old fashioned merry German atmosphere then this is definitely a must for your next Vegas trip.  Also the beers are served in liter plus Mass glasses which make the experience all the more enjoyable.  They usually have live German music with guys dressed in traditional outfits and the frauleins look the part too.  Check it out and prepare to drink beer.",

The waiter was rude to begin with and screwed up my order. I ordered pumpkin soup (disgusting) and he brought out potato soup, when i politely told him it wasn't what I had ordered he sighed and said \"why don't you just try it anyway\" ... !! I was realy hungry and I like potato soup but I don't eat pork so I asked him if there was ham or bacon in it.. he rolled his eyes, hesitated and then said \"No.\" I stired it and there were big chunks of ham and sausage in it.. I told him he was wrong and there was ham in it and he was like fine, picked up the bowl and then put it in the middle of the table and was like \"why dont' you just keep it, the kitchen won't take it back\" ....... I seriously thought, for a moment, that we were on some candid camera..  So at the end of the meal after we got the check my friends decided they wanted shots (because they spank you with a paddle if you take a shot- and they thought that was cool), when my friend asked our server how much the server insisted he bring us another bill, but it took forever, so we got up to leave... he then came over and my friend asked how much and he sighed and said  they're \"about 12 dollars each\".... (on the menu they were 5 bucks)  he compeatly made up a number so he could get a tip- jackas*....  The food SUCKED- it was flavorless and the chicken was tough... just gross altogether...",

    "text": "This place is like Chuck E. Cheese for adults.  Adults who like to drink beer (and eat food that doesn't taste like cardboard).  Hofbrauhaus is unabashedly fun.  It's full of busty serving gals who deliver ales (and paddlings - we went for a friend's birthday party, and the gal literally handed his backside to him) with enthusiasm.  Oompah bands round out the music scene.  And you love lederhosen, it'll be like you died and went to Heaven.  The place is designed for good times.  They encourage you to stand on tables.  They want you to have fun.  They prefer you to be loud in your proclaimed enjoyment of beer.  The mood is pretty light and enjoyable.  The food is pretty excellent and decent portions.  There were a lot of things that looked tempting, but I tried the chicken sausages with a generous helping of tasty mashed potatoes.  Prices ran about $15-20 a plate.  The beer steins are huge, and I had even gotten a \"medium\" that led to a comfortable buzz.  If I can finagle a way to come here without driving, I want one of the ridiculous sized ones.  There is a ton of audience participation.  They really want to get the crowd involved whether up on stage, or if they come to you in the crowd.  It wasn't one of those awkward vibes where they will force unwilling restaurant patrons to get involved, but if you want to participate, they most definitely will accommodate.  The only issue that I had during my outing was during the cash handling at the end.  We had a BIG birthday group, and those things always become hectic with a lot of separate checks.  The problem was that due to a miscommunication, the status of whether someone within our party already covered all our expenses versus if we still needed to pay became a back and forth \"yes/no/yes/no\" issue that while resolved, I wasn't sure if it was until credit card statements were checked.  But to her credit, our server was very patient and was trying very hard to get everything sorted out amongst the beer chants and drinking contests.  I think in a smaller group, that won't be an issue.  I will check out Hofbrauhaus again.  Between the lively atmosphere, friendly staff, tasty food and copious amounts of beer, it's a hard place to be bummed out in.  Just keep your party under 40 people, and it should be fine for an unique dining experience.",

The beer was absolutely delicious as was my entree and my friends. Immediately we realized that we found a real gem off the strip! I couldn't leave without purchasing one of the boots for my apartment.   If you are looking for out-of-the-norm fun while in Vegas this is definitely the place to go! Some people are put-off at sharing tables, but since I have been to Europe so many times it really didn't bother me. It's a guaranteed good time at Hofbrauhaus!",

As a huge Taiwanese sausage fan, I am pretty used to eating links and links of sausage.  So as I finished my sausage platter in 2 minutes, my friends were astonished. They couldn't even finish theirs.    Most interesting note: if you buy shots, the girls will spank you. Doesn't matter if your a rookie or a veteran.

You could bring every single craving for German food, and you would leave happy, stuffed, and your pockets wouldn't be too empty.  We came back here a little over a month ago, and the place was almost completely empty!  We couldn't help but wonder why.  Then we got a pretty clear picture.  The prices have greatly increased, they try to majorly upsell you on items in their gift shop, and service was incredibly slow.  Previously, you could order a sausage plate and it would come with sauerkraut, a potato salad, pretzel, etc... Yeah, not anymore.  You still get the pretzel and some pickle slices, but that's pretty much it.  Oh, and you're paying almost double what it used to cost!  I'm not too big on beer, so the option to drink from a giant boot didn't really appeal to me.    It took over 30 minutes for the food to arrive, and we only ordered sausages.  At the end of the lunch, our waitress reminded us to mention her name if we bought anything in the gift shop because it would really help her out.  *sigh*  I get that she's just doing her job, but the price increase on the meal was sufficient enough, TYVM!  We won't be going back.  This makes me very, very sad.",

Now for those who have been to the original in Munich, don't expect the same experience.  The Munich one has been around for a long time and is both a local hangout and a tourist attraction plus the beer isn't quite the same.  Still The LV version provides a taste of the german brew house.  The pretzels are unique to the area and bigger than your head.  The schnitzel is excellent and the portions large.  The beer pricing is reasonable and it is always fun to waive a liter of beer around.  The band always gets the crowd up on the tables and the servers are friendly.  Watch out for the paddle!!!  Great place just across from the HRH in an area that is starting to get a late night crowd as more pubs open nearby.

    "text": "Love their beer!!   I was over the moon when I discovered they had a beer hall in Vegas, so this place was a definite must on places to visit while there.  We had perfect timing as Germany was playing in the World Cup when we happened to swing by.  What an amazingly fun atmosphere.  My husband got the sauerbraten (very tender and not uber sour) and loved it.  I had a bite and definitely wanted more.  I don't tend to like a lot of German food (sorry), just not my flavor palette, but I definitely enjoyed theirs.  I even liked the side of cabbage (my husband didn't as much as another local to us German restaurant).  I had to get the Bavarian Cheese appetizer with pretzel and a caesar salad, both were mouth watering.  But the True highlight for me was their beer.  I was in 7th heaven!!  The downside, they were charging for water - when the bill came they charged us $4 for a bottle of water that normally costs around $1 at a gas station.  This was the most expensive lunch I think I have ever had, but it was worth it for us.  Their hefe weizen is phenomenal!  In case I forgot to mention that before ;P",

    "text": "I was expecting such an experience and while I can say I will never forget my lunch there, I also will never return.    Everything we had was incredibly heavy. Doused in dressing and thick sauces, it all tasted so fattening and yet somehow, flavorless.  The pretzel was probably the best thing we ordered with a \"cheese\" and two mustards. I put the cheese in parentheses because it tasted more like cream cheese than cheese. We shared the curry wurst to start as well. Long hot-dogs covered in a curry sort of ketchup. I liked the flavor of the ketchup, but its all so heavy and greasy that it was hard for me to move beyond that. The fries tasted like something that came out of a bad cafeteria.   The space is pretty impressive and feels like a college dining hall. Long rectangular tables make great fun for large parties ready to embark on a German dining excursion. The best part of the lunch was when our waitress with the board she used to bring us shot glasses paddled my friends. They spank was so hard it echoed throughout the entire place.  Overall, this isn't really the type of experience I want when going to Vegas, so I probably won't return. If you know someone who is found of German food and beer, bring them here and they will love you forever. Bring someone who is on a diet and they will likely try to kill you before the meal is over...",

I got the plate with 4 different sausages and my wife got the Wiener Schnitzel with mashed potatoes and sauerkraut, of course. half a littler of Heffewiesen went down pretty easy after all that food! It was early and kind of empty and the live music was loud, something that I would probably enjoy later in the day and after some more beers. Good for a break from the strip if you have the time or exhausted your options there.",

The food while good was very predictable and authentic.  I had the sauerbraten without cabbage and it was ok but not anything that would cause me to come back.  The staff was friendly and responsive.  If I were a heavy bear drinker I might have enjoyed it more.  Also it was too loud to carry on a good conversation and that is problematic for me.",

For desert..I drank that to.  It came in the form several Apfelkorn shots.  Those are crazy dangerous, especially when you add the element of pain compliance of some paddle welding fraulein.  The architecture and noise create a most festive atmosphere.  Second time around I opted to try some of the food in addition to the beer and shots minus the spanking.  My buddy and I ordered up a sausage sampler which was served on a three tiered plate.  Lot's of sausage, sauerkraut, some mashed potatoes and a couple of pretzels thrown in for good measure.  This was definitely a meal within it's self.  We also ordered up some Schitzel Wiener Art with a side of Jagerschnitzel gravey. The breadeed pork cutlet was delicious.  If you are looking for a loud, social place to eat a little bit and drink a lot this is the place to go.",

Very overpriced, we ordered one combo platter one cheese spaetzl dish, 2 deserts to go ($10 each) and 1 cocktail and soda. Total was almost $90. Another negative, This place is listed as good for kids and I must say that even with my 7 & 9 yr old who love to be around music and noise, but this place is unbearably loud. Can't even talk to one another or hear the waitresses, and I'm not exaggerating either. My kids looked like they were drowning in the noise, both were slumped in their seats almost falling asleep because of the disturbing noise of drunkenness surrounding this large room of hoorah and screaming. You literally feel trapped. Women were being spanked with paddles by the employees, while men cheered on. I wish I could say I enjoyed some kind of aspect here since I insisted on going here and really looked forward to the experience, but instead I felt like a horrible mother and completely ripped off. Never again.   Maybe perfect for a fraternity get together, but not for us.",

Do not go if you do not like sitting at a table with strangers. That's how they seat everyone there. I could barely hear myself talk because it was so loud with the live band and spankings. They also have an alphorn that they play at every table to get you to tip them. No kidding, they will set the horn on top of your table and play the same tune at every table in the restaurant to get tipped. It gets very old, very fast. If that's not enough, they also go around asking if you want your picture taken, which they try to make you buy at the end of your meal. The food was meh. My pretzel was hard and the potato dumplings weren't great. The only reason why this review has two stars rather than one is because of their sausage and apple strudel. The strudel was actually really good. Other than that, I don't have any interest in returning.",

And were they good; they come with a tangy curry and a side of fries (you can sub for a salad if you want).   Spidey and I came here to try out another German restaurant, and this one always comes up, so we thought, why not?  The inside is made out to look like a German hall, complete with long tables were you are forced to sit close to strangers. It's a very nice place, very open and bright, but I can see that when they get busy, it would be very crowded. As it was a weekday afternoon, there weren't that many people there.   So we got the radish dish to start, which is a work of art. They give you a mound of spiral radish and ones shaped like flowers amongst slices of buttered bread with chives. Really good.  Spidey got some meat smothered in gravy with a dumpling that she really liked. For dessert we got the apple strudel and the black forest cake, all very good.  The food was good, but the service lacked a lot here. Like I stated before, there were not many people here (less than 20) but we were there for well over 2 hours, waiting mostly for our things. The dessert was the worst part, because our waitress came over and asked if we had gotten it yet. No. We had not. So she had to go and get it, which took a very long time.   I would go back just to have the vegan furters again, but other than that, I wouldn't.",

That way I could avoid the obnoxiously loud cafeteria-esque dining room and the utterly terrible live music.  And even if the food wasn't extraordinary it was at least decent and decently priced.

The inside is a loud cavernous place which, if you are going somewhere for conversation during your meal, this is not the spot.   The beers and food are good and we must have sampled just about everything they had to offer. Actually, come to think of it the beer and food were the best part.   I gotta say, I'd give this place 4 stars but they had a annoying bathroom attendant in the mens restroom who would engage every.single.person who entered with banter and mediocre jokes galore. I get that they are trying to make the whole experience all the more entertaining but when I hit the head I'm more of a \"get in and get out\" state of mind.",

My husband orders a beer and an ice tea for me. We get our bill, my husband puts a $100 dollar bill in the sleeve, we get our change and its only $6.00 dollars... confused we ask the other frazzled dazzled waitress. Miss we gave you a $100 bill why is our change only $6.00???   Her response: super defensive is her response NO you didn't it was a $20... ok.. hmm our friend sitting right next to us said I saw you put the $100 inside.  She is very sure we gave her a $20, but she can call her manager and they can check the camera. I said YES, please do so..  Few minutes pass her and the manager came by...and the manager states to me we checked the camera and there was no $100 dollars... ok getting more pissed at this rate I say ok show me because I have a second set of eyes who saw what was left.   The manager then states to me....now your calling me a liar and a thief, okay wow this is how you treat your customers???",

The live music is the right instrumentation, but not sure they play songs from the Sound of Music in Munich.  It's almost Americanized German music.  He was also a little loud for the number of people there for lunch, which wasn't very many.  If the place if packed, I'm sure it wouldn't have echoed that much.   In typical German fashion, there are NO substitutions!  Therefore, we ordered a mix of dishes in which we obtained everything we wanted.  However, the food ended up just being OK.  Nothing special to write home to Germany about.    Overall we had a good experience though.  For someone who has never been to Germany, or isn't planning on going, this is definitely worth the visit.",

I was told that all the ones outside of Munich are very close to the one back in the father land, both in decore, food and feeling.  I just didn't get that here, sure they had the silver wear in the cup on the table, and the menu had many of the same items, and they had the beer and the large maB... but it just wasn't the same.  It was way more expensive, the same large pretzel the girls walk around with for 2 euro at HBH, was charged as $15 with some mustards... the wurst plate lacked the 5th wurst, and the ones that were there tasted nothing like the ones in germany (and wtf is with the huge fat wurst... not uniformed in size with the others).  Where is my favorite half roast chicken? Where is my pig knee?   I really wanted to like this place, I wanted direly to find something to love, but it just wasn't there. The beer tasted different ( how ever it did have the right type of yeasty head ). The band did ein Prositen all wrong (and ask anyone who has been to HBH or HB Festival Tent at Bavarian Gardens during Oktoberfest you will never forget the way it is supposed to be sung).  The waitress was nice, the food was way over priced. My GF and I had: 1 Beer, 2 x Sausage Plates, 2x order dumplings and a pretzel for $90... We could have eaten at far better places for that.  I really really wanted to like it, but I left feeling empty hearted.   I guess if you have never been to the real one, or have only been to it as a sissy tourist of only half an evening,  maybe this place would suffice. But for me, I wish it was just branded something different so I did not have my hopes up.",

You never know who is going to sit next to, the local, the out of towner or a man and his family from Austria.  I have been to the original one in Germany and when I heard they opened one in Vegas I had to come and check it out. We ended up sitting next to a family that had originally came from Austria and when we go to talking and he found that I had stopped in his country for a time being we became the best of friend, or maybe the yager helped us become friends. Never the less we enjoyed dinner and drinks by the pint. Go to their website to find out when they have bands playing thats the best time to go. The MC is constantly interacting with the guest to play various game, or just to see how your trip is going.   If your looking for a quite place to wine and dine this is not the joint. If you wanna drink, dance while standing in your seat this is the spot",

Probably would have been tolerable except for the server was totally over her job, acted like it was a chore to serve us, and took forever to get our tab after eating. Unlikely we'll be back here.

    "text": "Hofbrauhaus was such a fun, and funny, treat. Of course, Las Vegas was the perfect place to recreate a \"German beerhouse\" in the States. This place is huge, almost cavernous, with a loud, boisterous band playing in the front of the hall and long tables of reveling diners singing along. Both the food and drink menus are expansive, with plenty of sausage to go around. You can get beers in all different sizes, from the 1/2 liter to the full mug, and I bet you there's a boot option there somewhere.   I'm not sure if all Bavarian dishes are like this, but it seemed like the \"Specialty\" ones offered at Hofbrauhaus include meat, carbs, and cream. Indeed, the Jagerschnitzel  that I got had those three components, as well as bacon and cranberries. The plate was the size of my head, and the pork was buried underneath a mountain of sauce and bacon. I think they made a mistake; I don't think this dish is meant for one person. The schnitzel was pretty good; it was well-seasoned and the bacon lent the right saltiness to the whole dish. It was nice having the noodles sop up some of the cream, and the cranberries also helped cut through some of richness. What makes a dinner here a real treat, however, isn't the beer and the sack of food you get. It's the rowdiness of the crowd, the whack of the paddle (you get one to the butt on your special occasion), the boom of the band, and a thousand other things that make this a truly unique experience.",

However, if you want to drink litres of bier on a long table with friends and strangers eating delicious German food and singing along with live Oompah bands, this IS the place.  This place is a party, it is impossible not to have fun here. Rather than seat patrons on individual tables for each party, guests of Hofbrauhaus are seated on a long wooden tables; per biergarten tradition. The food is amazing, great schnitzel and potato salad. Lots of heavy strong German beer, served by the litre. They also have a full bar if that's your thing. They have live music with lots of audience participation. On a good night you'll have girls dancing on tables, fat guys blowing in alphorns, and drunks making loud, joyous merryment. A must for any Las Vegas trip!",

It should be advertised as such and not as a dinner place. I wanted to leave but was offered the Biergarten which was much quieter and only 1 family in there. Our server, Michelle, was scary as heck. We ordered dinner (I was not a happy camper to begin with walking into this very loud place) and she asked if we wanted appetizers. we said no - I laughed and mentioned I was going to go for the dessert instead. She told me I would not have room for dessert in a very nasty way.   At the end of trying to eat shoe leather and the very thin steak my husband had (tasteless) I didn't want dessert. Just horrible.  And everyone reviewing that claims to have grown up on German food - no way. I've been to the best German restaurants in New York City and I have been to Germany numerous times.

I was thoroughly entertained by everything there.  From the band reminiscent of Oktoberfest, to the dominatrix lady whose job is to spank people (I assume for a living -- could you imagine?).  I wasn't extremely happy with my meal (because I eat mounds like a monster), but like in reviews previous, it's hit or miss.  I should have gotten a burger or something, those looked fantastic.  And the fries I tried were pretty fly.  I wish I could try it again!  I just don't live in Las Vegas.  Next time for sure!",

Giant tables filled with happy people singing, dancing on tables, pounding beers by the liter. The host is fun and does a great job getting the crowd riled up with stein-holding and liter-pounding competitions. If you're celebrating a birthday, he'll bring the person to the front stage while the band plays the birthday song and gets the whole crowd to sing along. So fun!  It's a great pre-party destination to get some hearty food and kick start a good party vibe for the night. Plus, they close at like midnight, so you can't stay too late. I recommend arriving around 8pm (make reservations to guarantee a table) and expect to stay at least 2 hours.",

If you can handle the loud noise and potentially sitting next to people you may not know (seating is long tables and benches with backs) singing and having a good time this is definitely a place you want to visit. The food is good for sure I love the massive soft pretzels that they have *drools* The beer is epic! I love their Hefeweizen it's smooth and delicious, I wish I could have on at this very moment. :) Yes you can drink from a \"Das Boot\" you can even buy one. Pretty much this place is awesome and a good time, gotta visit at least once!",

It was so loud in the main dining room, we ended up staying at the bar and eating there, which was nice because you got to see/hear all of the action without having to deal with the crazy quality of it.  The food was OK.  I was a little startled by the $13 pretzel (that is not a typo), which came with 3 dips (2 mustards, 1 cheese).  We then tried the jagerschnitzel, which I personally make at home.  The food came up so quickly, you know it was sitting back there already made.  While it was tasty, a piece of pork and some homemade noodles did not seem to be worth $19.  We ended up spending a lot of money for very little food or drink.  It was rather disappointing, I doubt I would go back.",

When I had their beer in Munich, it was the beginning of a beautiful relationship! No doubt in my mind that the Hofbrauhaus has the BEST beer! I swear it's Germany's Purity Laws! When I go to have the beer again in Vegas, it was just as great as it was in Munich.  We did decide to have dinner here to try the German food. I'll have to say, it's definately not authentic, but they certainly do try to make it authentic. It was pretty close to what I had in Munich, so I was happy about that. The only real downfall was the service. Our server in particular seemed to be in a foul mood the entire night, which was a bummer for us. The atmosphere was great, there was a live band playing that could be heard even in the biergarten. They definately tried to make the place just like how it looks in Munich. They're really similar, the only thing different is the size of the building.   Overall, we had a great time here. I'd definately go back just for the beer!",

Other beers besides the hefe are ok, but you should go wheat.  The place if far too loud when music is playing. I've been to the original HBH in Munich, which is loud, but the sound here dwarfs that. They have recaptured the loudness of a beer hall, but the music is overdone and makes conversation impossible. It really is loud enough already.   Service is very good, if you can communicate with servers nonverbally.   And there's lots of entertainment value in just watching the other patrons.",

    "text": "What a wonderful place! The food is super, the entertainment decidedly hokey, and the beer... Oh the beer. I'm a beer-lover and was very happy with, not only the quality, but also the sizes available -- pints!  There were songs about beer (sung in German), grown men asking to be paddled on the ass by the waitresses in front of the entire hall, games to win glass steins. Oh yes, the entire place was up on the tables dancing and singing along as best (or worst) as they could.   Hofbrauhaus isn't your typical \"sit-down\" restaurant by any means. Rather, the eating \"hall\" is full of tables that are shared among everyone. Groups are seated far enough apart to have their own space, but I can see the place being filled & mingled with patrons on a busy night.   This time around, I took some advice from a fellow Yelper and ordered the stuffed chicken (Grillhendl). It's difficult to describe, but the flavor was definitely German and very delicious. Erin Ashley (my wonderful woman) ordered some type of salad -- potato salad mixed with green salad & a type of schnitzel on top. Oh the glory.  For an appetizer we were served a soft preztel accompanied with three sauces -- spicy mustard, sweet-spicy mustard, and a thick-creamy spread made from Brie cheese. Personally, I'm not a big fan of Brie. But this spread is to live for.   I sang. I danced. I drank. I didn't win a stein, but I will keep going back to have fun and play the game. And so should you.",

Atmosphere: Hands down the closest thing to the real Hofbrauhaus in Munich and I'm a big fan!! The beer hall is huge and beautiful decorate, just awesome.  Food: Honestly, I always have a hard time reviewing German food since most of the time it taste nothing like the food in Germany and second it is not German food at all! Not so much with this place, there is a ton of food on the menu which just, well almost taste as good as home but pretty identical. Spoiler there're a few dishes which I don't agree with but overall great job. My personal favorite is the Wiener-schnitzel with the potato salad. Make sure you order the Pork sausages or Wieners with the potato salad as well instead of the mash potato's , it is sooooooo good!!!! Please try the Obatzda with the pretzel and if the have it the liverwurst while there....yummy. Please don't forget the Apple strudel for dessert, it is freaking awesome.  Verdict: 5 stars   Can't wait to come back :) Bon Appetite",

It was pretty dang good but it should be for $16 bucks.  The beers were overpriced but authentic.    The service was decent once we flagged down our server.  It seems they seated a table of 20 just before the three of us and it was the same server for both.     Overall, pretty disappointed with this place.  Super touristy, over-priced mediocre food, expensive authentic beer and an unmemorable service experience.   I won't be back and will just stick with the local German cafe in Vegas.",

(I didn't even know how to say the restaurant name lol)   I walked in (make sure you make a rsvp because it can get busy) and while I was waiting for my friends to show up I noticed a gift shop (right side) before you enter the restaurant itself. The gift shop gave me a great idea of what I was getting myself into for dinner. I noticed all these beer mugs and realized it was going to be an Oktoberfest environment.    The host walked us to our table and I was in all ahhh in everything in here. I felt like I was really in Germany. The LIVE music, the uniforms, the tables, the food and the whole building itself. When it was time to order our dinner our server Olga was amazing. Very friendly and helpful in helping us with what to order. She recommended the Pretzel for an appetizer, Grillhendl for dinner and Kasekuchen for desert.   Pretzel - It came out quick and it was delicious. Warm and fresh. The 3 different dipping sauces were all yummy.   Grillhendl - The chicken was so moist and the potato salad that it came with it was very tasty.   Kasekuchen - This was a Bavarian cheesecake with raspberry sauce.  OMG this was so freaking good. The cheesecake was very fluffy and it had enough raspberry sauce for every bit.   At 7:30pm the LIVE SINGER told every to stand up on our benches. Yes!!!! We really stood up on our benches and started doing the............ \"CHICKEN DANCE\" it was so much fun. I don't drink but everyone that did had their beer mugs in the air and everyone had a great time!   My friends I was with had their German sausages and said they were good. TIP!!!! Make sure you check inn on yelp and get yourself a FREE beer. I recommend this place! I can't wait to go back!",

Friendly staff, lots of open family style seating like a German beer garden. Fun ambiance. Everyone was very attentive. We decided to order the pretzel combo for our appetizer. Came with two types of mustard and cheese. It was good, but we've had better. For the entrees, I got the Bayerische spezialitaten plate which came with pork roast, a pork chop and a sausage. The roast pork and sausage was very good, but the pork chop was dry and didn't have much flavor. My wife ordered the Oktoberfest bratenteller which was barvarian pork and beef in hunter sauce. She liked it, but the sauce was a bit on the sweet side. Portions for both dishes were fairly large. Overall, not too bad, but we've had better German food",

No worries, there is plenty of room for luggage here in the festhaus. We love it when the live music is going as well, so festive and reminiscent of our time in Munich for Oktoberfest years ago.   For the vegans- you are in luck. This is the only place in the US so far that I have found vegan schnitzel. And it is delicious! They include cranberry sauce and delish potato salad (sounds underwhelming? well don't you worry, it doesn't disappoint!)   It is always so hard to decide between the vegan schnitzel and the vegan curry frankfurters. So, we have to come here at least twice during our stay in Vegas, that way I can have both. (And sometime 3 times...) Oh and beer.",

    "text": "Gemutlichwhat?  Something was missing. Sure, there were liters of Hofbrau, meters of sausage, and servers pouring out of their dirndls. I'm a big fan of those things. There was live music, big bench style tables, and a beerhall large enough to host any Oktoberfest that the Vegas crowd could throw at it, but yet, there was something very important that was missing. It started when I walked in, alone. I was asked if I wanted to sit at the bar. Well, the bar is the least German place I have ever seen. About 12 seats long, there were three different sports balls games going at one time, and it had all of the warmth and coziness as a Walmart entryway. Why would I come to a German Beerhall to sit at a TGI McFunster-style bar to eat my wurstteller? Once I convinced the three-hostesses to let me sit in the beerhall, I was asked for my email, phone #, first born, etc... Not cool bro. Then the real fun began. First, let me say that the beerhall is awesome. It's huge, and really reminds me of the main hall at the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, except that this one was EMPTY. Sure, it was early-ish on a Weds evening (about 6:00ish), but probably 80% of the tables were completely empty. So, why then was I sat at the farthest away from the stage table when I said I wanted to be close to the band? Worst of all, I was seated facing the wall, so my view was literally, nothing! To boot, there were four other people at the table who were totally offended that I was sat with them. Folks, if you have ever been in a real beerhall, you would know that this is the best way to meet people. Assuming that everyone here are tourist, it should have been a great place to strike up a conversation with the people to your right or left, but these folks just didn't get it. Of the four of them, only two were drinking beer, and only one of those were drinking German beer. They shared a single small pretzel. Why in God's name were they here, and why I was sat next to these people. Enough of the bad.... I was very happy that the food was exactly as I hoped it would be. I ordered the sausage platter (wurst teller) and it was great! Two frankfurters and two Nurnberger bratwurst served with a side of kraut and proper mustard. And of course there was the beer. I assume that the HB beer served here is imported from Munich. It was proper. Also, my waitress was very attentive and my food came out quickly.  Will I be back? Yes, but not by myself. There were videos being run on a loop showing crowds of people having a great time, so clearly I was here on a slow day. I really feel if the hostess had been more considerate with where I was sat, I would have had a better time. Lesson learned. Next time I will bring the party with me!!",

Walking in you have a huge high convex ceiling with beautiful decor and live music that vibrates the building.   My husband and I came for lunch and sat at a table with a couple who it was their first time too.  We all had fun listening to the live music and watching people get spanked with their shots for their birthdays.   The best part of the whole amazing experience was the food. I had the fried fish with housemade potato salad 10/10 absolutely perfect. My husband had sausage, which was devine. And then we took a slice of German chocolate cake home for desert. 10/10 savoring flavor and quality ingredients.   I cant wait to come back!",

    "text": "What a fun experience! My mom and I went to Oktoberfest in Munich a few years ago and we always look back so fondly on the memories (some of which might be fuzzy due to beer) we made there. Coming to Hofbrauhaus was such a treat and so reminiscent of our time at Oktoberfest! We came with my dad and my sister - my dad and I are vegetarian so we were so happy to see the vegan options. They were delicious! The pretzel was also amazing - they say they are imported from Germany and whether or not that is True, I absolutely love that they were huge and served with delicious dips.   Now, let's get to the entertainment. We came on a Sunday afternoon so I fully expected it to be a quiet meal. When we got there, we only saw about 5 or so tables full but, no matter, the entertainer still went on! He was wearing traditional lederhosen, was singing traditional German drinking songs (e.g. ein prosit), and even had a Swedish horn! He also had us play drinking games, which were so fun. My mom and I won a free beer!   Last thing - I would not recommend the dessert here. They were not bad, just nothing too special. Not worth taking a star off, but worth mentioning because it's a good idea to get a sweet bit elsewhere if you're really into finishing your meals with something sugary.",

The beer was very good and strong. For our meals I ordered the Riesenbratwurst and hubby ordered the Oktoberfest Bratenteller. All the food was delicious and filling.  Our server was Coco, he was super cool and always kept our drinks full.  They had musicians performing, they would shout out something and the crowd would say \"Ho\", lift their glass then drink beer. A lady was spanking people at a table and very hard, you could see their ass wobble, it was hilarious. This was the most fun I've ever had at a restaurant.   Everything about this place was wonderful from the food, the service, the entertainment, Coco. Everything was great, now I wanna be plan a vacation to Germany.",

They should have checked in at the host stand while waiting for me, since the wait must have been at least 45 minutes. Instead we enjoyed a beer by the front bar and talked.   Finding our seats was a maze. So much going on here! Music, theatrics, spanking... Apparently Hofbrauhaus is popular for bachelor parties. Rolling my eyes out of my head.  We sat at our little table in the back patio, aka the fake outdoors. These types of rooms in Vegas always get me. Way to set the ambiance. For dinner, one colleague and I shared the white sausage plate with a few sides.  The food was not bad. Then again, I don't have much of a standard for German food. Our waitress seemed impatient with us, but maybe it'd been a long day for her.  We ended our meal with apple strudel because it came with ice cream. It wasn't quite what I expected, but it was a sweet way to end our meal. While I'd definitely come back for the beer, I wasn't too hot about the food. It's an experience!",

Enjoyed some beer, both the 0.5L and full liter, which were fun to hold! It should be noted that they are heavy, so it's super impressive to watch the waitresses carry them all.

The beer was awesome. The pretzel, sausages, and sour kraut were really good. If I weren't already full from our day, I'd devour the whole entire tray of food. The potato cake was delish as well. Tables were long and good for 1 big family or 2-3 families. It was a great way for family style dining or meeting new friends. I am part German who has never been to Germany or anywhere in Europe, as a matter of fact, but it's just what I would've imagined it be like when I go........24/7 Oktoberfest. They had shots too, if you didn't finish the shot, a spanking with a paddle would soon ensued. Wow. I usually love a good spanking by my husband in private but I was really scared that if I asked for a shot, I would be publicly called out. They do have a bar towards the back so if you wanna shot but not into spanks then just slip out to grab yourself an old fashioned shot of Jagermeister, which to me is surprisingly good.",

All you do, is get to the HARD ROCK CAFE shuttle from the main strip on Las Vegas Blvd South, and walk across the street to Hofbrahaus. Then you're there! We were instantly transported into Germany! The waitstaff all had on authentic German/Bavarian garb and they couldn't be nicer. (all except 1 waiter. He was a total bitchy queen, but once I requested a new waiter, all was well. The place was SO fun, I couldn't have anyone ruin it!) The place is loud and raucous, and FUN! There is a band who plays German music, a jagermeister girl who spanks your behind pretty hard after you take a shot, and great food and beer. I had a smoked pork platter with AMAZING German potato salad, sauerkraut and red cabbage. The place was great and we didn't want to leave. They also had delicious looking desserts that we had no room to sample. We were SO FULL. Everything was reasonably priced, and the environment was awesome. I would def make a point to return whenever I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "I had so much fun here when I visited with two friends.  We started with 40oz steins of beer and settled in for what was supposed to be an hour wait  (be smart, make a reservation).  Instead, after about 20 minutes we were whisked in to be seated at the German beer hall style bench seating.  The oompa band was playing and immediately we were involved in the action.  \"Stand on the bench\" the singer kept yelling.  \"Raise your steins!\" he continued.  Where else do you get to stand on the table, sing, chug beers and not get tossed out?  Our fellow diners were sauced and having a great time, but never rowdy or unfriendly.  We got a plate of sausage and some incredible pretzels.  The waitresses were awesome and very sexily dressed in classic tavern maid garb.  The action continued with drinking contests, the playing of the horns, and stein holding contests.  Get there early because the place shuts down by midnight.",

The Grillhendl which is Half Roasted Chicken, not as good as I thought it would be.  The place was alive with live music, some fun dancing and tables are laid out like picnic tables you see in Rest Areas.  If you make a reservation, you will be seated with other people but you can request to move to another table that is not occupied.   The Pretzels for appetizers are much softer which we liked than the ones included in the meal of choice.  The Potato Soup was good. If you like beer, this is the place for you.",

Was in town for a trade show and the first place we visited for dinner and drinks was this spot.  When I walked in, I thought I walked through a time machine and went back a few decades to a restaurant in Germany.  Once inside, you forget that you are even in Las Vegas.  For some, that might be good and for others, a deal breaker.  It was loud.  There was a band playing what sounded like German folk songs.  Oh wells, \"when in Rome\" they say...  Service was good.  It was friendly.  It was fast.  Beer and sausages.  What else would you want?  We had some plates of pretzels and this deep fried item that remind me of tonkatsu.  The gal walking around with the paddle and shot glasses was cool.  We had a few in our group that went for the paddling, which I suppose is popular within this establishment.  I say, \"to each their own.\"  I would come back but with a beer loving crowd.  If you need a quieter place to eat and drink, look elsewhere.  As they say in Germany, gut essen !!  Enjoy!",

Once just to be able to order after sitting in a near empty restaurant for five minutes.   I'm seriously allergic to beef. Asked if the bean soup has dairy or beef in it. After I ate almost half the bowl, and confirmed with two people no beef, the waitress rushed over and said it's made w beef broth. We got our sausage and pork with a brown sauce. I asked... beef? Got a HUGE eye roll.   Food. Mediocre at best. Seriously mean that. If you like German food. Go somewhere else. If you don't care that much and want beer in a big glass, tourist thing and a live band at night - and pay out your ass for mediocre food. It's great.",

Hubby ordered the schnitzel of course and I wish I would've ordered that instead of my plate, which is saying something because my dinner was to die for. We're local and came to celebrate my hubby's birthday, he was so excited! We went on a night where they were doing a tapping on a new beer and were having a big party so everyone in the restaurant got a free beer. Everything was so fun until a big party came in and our waitress completely ignored us. After an hour and a half since we had gotten our food and were ready to leave we couldn't even wave her down. We asked someone to grab her for us and her response was \"I don't know who your waiter is\" and walked away from us. We ended up spending a whole extra hour and a half here frustrated because we couldn't get our check and then had to wait for her to come back to pay. We'll be back next year for hubby's birthday because he was in love with the food, but for almost $100 for the two of us to eat and have such a horrible experience I'm very disappointed.",

I had never experienced it, so I decided to give it a whirl.  We showed up and all the servers are in costume.  I love that!  Some people might think it's lame, but I personally think it adds to the experience!    Huge beers? Yupp, my version heaven!  The beers were good, big, and flowing all night!  We spent quite a long time drinking and snacking the night away!  Their food?  Just as good as the beer!! Since my bestie and I are both equally indecisive, we decided to split two of their main dishes.  We got the burger and the chicken sandwich.  Both were AMAZING!  The meat combination in the burger had the perfect flavor and made it stand out compared to other burgers I've had in this city.  The chicken sandwich was perfectly crispy and I enjoyed every second of it.    It wouldn't be a complete German experience without getting a pretzel!  Just as enjoyable as our main dishes.    Having the german music in the background, great food, and good service... this place earns its 4 stars.  It's a bit pricey, which makes me upset because I can't afford to go there more often.  But, I will definitely be back as a local when I'm feeling the German itch!",

I would have to say I love me some Hofbrauhaus! The beer is without a doubt the most crisp and clean beer that is the epitome of German beers brewed under the German beer purity laws (say that ten times fast).  As for this place it in ever sense of the word the most water down version of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munchen. The location doesn't give this church of beer justice, it adds the Vegas grime and it ends up feeling like it is robbed of its authenticity. The pretzel was great! but the lack of mustards was disappointing, usually there is regional addition that can be added to your pretzel (ex/ awesome beer cheese in Pittsburgh), in Vegas you get some cold cheese spread...

Our waitress was nice enough to start.  We ordered sodas with no ice and a couple minutes later she brings us out soda glasses that are half full.  No exaggeration at all.  We look at her and ask what's up and she explains that their system only pours so much soda per drink and with no ice it leaves the glass half full.  She then explains that you get two refills and we can use one of our refills to fill the glass.  What the hell?  Are you serious?  I have NEVER been to a restaurant with that policy.  This is a pretty pricy place so the fact they are cheap on soda is doubly strange.  And I wanted to substitute fries for the potato salad in my 18 dollar meal and she said no substitutions.  Also my dad asked the waitress what kind of German beverages that were available that were non alcoholic and the waitress got an attitude and laughed at him.    I don't care if the food is good or not.  I don't care if the girls are dressed up like they are working Fantasyland at Disneyland.  For the price you pay for dinner here their policy on food and drinks suck here.    I will not return.  :0)",

Since we had 2 big tables of us, of course the MC pulled all of us up to do the chicken dance in front of the whole restaurant, plus almost all of the guys got spanked by the wenches (is that what they're called?)   People were just getting smacked all over the place! Those ladies do not mess around and really give it to all these guys butts. It's definitely a sight to see! The food is good and big. The beers are good and I love that the Oktoberfest ones are actually from Germany. Hofbrauhaus is definitely an Oktoberfest experience! We actually met a bunch of guys from Germany here too! Apparently we met lots of Germans all weekend.  Get ready to drink, yell, sing, stand on your chairs, dance, and just have a good time.",

In addition, there was a live band playing German polka songs for the most part; a beautiful lady who will deliver spankings for a price; and a person who will also photograph your group (again for a price).  Food was good.....and service was friendly.  Large restaurant with 2 rooms - one where you sit at tables with other people closer to the band; and one in the garden area where you can sit just with people you want to sit with..  We opted for the garden area, but either would make for a fun evening.....  Prices are moderate.....we had a coupon for a free 10 ounce glass of beer and they were happy to honor it.",

    "text": "I went to the original Hofbrauhaus in Europe and thought it was a giant tourist trap...well it's even more of a tourist trap here!   Let's play the adjective game: oom-pah filled kitschy super-loud brown creamy sauce-y (Have to make it an adjective) WTF...what's going on with those spankings? (not an adjective)  Ok, so I'm experiencing a classic Vegas moment of cognitive dissonance...something I know (and don't quite love) from Europe has been transported via the Starship Enterprise to be adjacent to my hotel in Vegas.  I can see how this place could be fun, but really?  Is there where you come in Vegas?    The Food: Food is standard German fare, and it was acceptable but nothing special.  Sausages, spaetlzle, sauerkraut, big cuts of meat in brown creamy sauce.  It's served promptly and without any circumstance.  The Beer: Well, they have the basic Hofbrauhaus beers: light, dark, a few seasonals.  Prices top actual Oktoberfest prices by quite a bit...they even make Canada and NYC seem cheap.  The Germans are not imaginative with their beer styles, but what they do, they do well.  The Atmosphere: Loud!  It's this strange super-new looking version of what is a very old establishment in Germany.  They have an oom-pah band going which they seem to have imported, however, they're quite hard to make out because the sound system is poor.  The crowd is a little bit rowdy.  You even see some real Germans there, well, because they like to eat German food when they travel.  The Weird: Whack! Is that middle-aged, fat business man being spanked by the waitress?  WTF?  They have this uber-strange practice here, in which a busty  \"shot girl\" comes over, sells you a shot, and gives you a very loud whack with a wooden paddle.  This is apparently their Las Vegas twist on the Hofbrauhaus...super strange! This is not a German tradition, in any way, shape, or form.  It was kind of creepy seeing groups of drunken middle-aged men bending over to get spanked in public.  They even sell T-Shirts that announce \"I've been spanked at the Hofbrauhaus\"  Ok, so I can see how this is something you might enjoy, but I, for one, can certainly skip it.",

I flew my sister in for her 35 birthday and wanted to take her here because it was tradition. I am German born in Munich, we brought my Dad here before he died and he loved it. We brought my mom last year, after my sons wedding in Vegas, before she went back home to VA, she loved it. I asked the waitress what was that spanking thing about? She said for a birthday you buy a shot and then get a paddle to the butt. We laughed and asked for it. It looked harmless and fun. She brought the shot on the paddle told my sister to stand up bend over on the table. She gentle spanked her once then twice then wound up and hit her as hard as she could. We of course laughed but knew she hit her way to hard. We looked at her butt when we got back to the hotel and OMG!!! It was all welted. She flew home Sunday and today it is still swollen and bruised! There was no need to hit her that hard. It is supposed to be fun and humiliating not excruciating pain. Shame on you Ms. Waitress. that was just really mean and totally un called for!! I have pictures .....",

Unfortunately, there were two big negatives that detracted from the experience:  First, the room is so noisy that you can't have a conversation with your fellow diners without literally shouting at each other.  There is a pretty even mix of crowd noise and live band music.  The band's sound was lost in the noisy room, but from what I could hear, they were not very good.  The seemed to alternate between trying to play German beer hall music and playing old pop hits...like CCR songs.  They need to decide what they are trying to be.  Second, when I went to pay the bill, I was informed there would be an extra fee of about 3% if I wanted to use my credit card.  Based on that alone, I will not be returning for another meal.",

The food was classic German and was very good.   The beer is expensive for a pint, but it is almost 3-12oz. beers worth.   If you have a large group and want to have some good, clean fun in Vegas, come here!!",

The brew band is a lot of fun with hits like the 'Don't forget to drink' song and 'It's time to drink'.  The beer and food is yum yum in the tum tum.  Be warned though, the food is quite rich & heavy.    You'll notice the Jagermeister shot girls working the floor.  Apparently if you opt to do a Jager shot with these gals they'll spank you with a vented paddle that reminds me a frat house spanking stick.  Some of the girls gave folks a gentle little pat pat, and then there were others who really wound up and whacked the crap out of their customers.  So if you plan to partake in the Jagers & spankings, you might want to strategically select your shot gal.  Use caution in the parking lot, as there are a lot of panhandlers.",

You are swept into a huge hall adorned with long tables where you are seated among strangers - who you will soon become best friends with!! Clinking your beer filled steins and singling along to the live music.  Simply amazing.  It doesn't stop there!  The food is phenomenal.  Start off with a homemade pretzel with their various dipping sauces, you'll be glad you did.  It's enough to share - especially if you want room for more beer and your main course.  I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art, a breaded pork cutlet with cranberry (on the side) and a side dish of bavarian potato salad.  Delicious - portion is huge!!! I ate a good half and enjoyed every last bite.  This is a must for any Vegas trip!  Order your friend a shot and hilarity will ensue.",

    "text": "The Hofbrauhaus has always been excellent to me and become a must stop during my visits to Las Vegas. Being native German, I appreciate the atmosphere the HB Las Vegas has to offer on busy nights. The beers and food are excellent, and while most of the waitresses are far from authentic, we once had a German lady that was an absolute blast. She was awesome!! Receiving a spanking for having Jager shots can be a LOT of fun for the right group. One drawback to the HB Vegas is that it can be slow at times, even on weekends, and the atmosphere occasionally suffers from this. However, when busy, the place is an absolute blast. The HB house beers are full of flavor and very authentic German.  Make sure you go with a group that appreciates the German culture and it's food since the menu may be too limited for those who don't.  If you are looking for a loud place, great beer and authentic German food the the HB Las Vegas has a fantastic evening in store for you.",

The cheese spread was delicious.  The pretzel was good, but would've been better if it was warm.  2) Hofbrauhaus hahnchen - Grilled chicken with a mushroom sauce and spatzle.  The chicken was nice and juicy, the mushroom sauce was nice and not intensely mushroomy, but the spatzle was annoying bland.  It was my first time having spatzle, so I wasn't sure what I should have expected, but no amount of sauce was able to help it out.  Our server's name was Sam, and she was awesome.  She gave us some great advice about the menu and was very funny.  The smacking of the butts with the shots was truly entertaining.  It was dinner and a show!  Major down side was how outrageous the prices were.  Outrageus!",

It's completely impossible to have a conversation without screaming into the ears of your neighbors - not my idea of a fun time.  My boyfriend and I wanted to try the one vegan dish on their menu: two vegan frankfurters with curry sauce and french fries. It was taking a long time to get our food, so I asked the waitress if the rye bread or pretzels were vegan, and clarified that vegan means no cheese, no butter, no milk, no eggs. She said she would check, but kept forgetting. Finally, by the time our meal came out an hour later, she said she had remembered to ask the cooks, and both the bread and pretzels either have butter in them or on them. At that point I didn't care to investigate further.  The frankfurters and curry sauce were very good, but the french fires appeared to be plain old frozen fries - very bland. For $14.95 I was not impressed.",

Most experiences here have been mediocre at best, but everyone knows that you come here for the ambiance and service, not the lukewarm, stale food or terrible beer. Bad food and beer aside, this time the service was terrible! It started in the parking lot. They have a \"complimentary valet\" that starts in the evening. The day I went, the valet started early because they were having some event. Had I known, I would've parked at UNLV down the street. Instead, I pulled in unknowingly and got stuck at the \"complimentary\" valet. I told the valet attendant that I did not have cash with me and asked if there was an area set aside for patrons who couldn't use valet. He very rudely said I could park somewhere else or walk to an ATM. I then politely asked to leave the parking lot to go park somewhere else (since they were blocking the route to the only exit with cones). He very rudely replied with, \"I guess this is complimentary but you really should visit an ATM before you leave.\"  Luckily I was able to borrow a few dollars from a friend, but I was horrified with the scam they have going on in their parking lot. I disagree with the valet for many reasons, yes, the parking lot is small but this in no way necessitates a valet. Further, it creates a long wait time to leave. I was one of two people waiting for the car to be pulled around. We both waited 10 minutes. I would've rather walked to my car (it would've been faster).   It should also be noted that the server was not attentive but it was a busy night. I was only able to order 1 beer because he never returned to my table. While I would've liked another beer- I am happy that I didn't waste another $9.00 on crappy beer. My sausage was lukewarm and kind of gross but the potato salad was good.   If you're looking for an October Fest experience, there are plenty of events happening throughout the valley. Don't waste your time on this tourist trap.",

The food was just all right and overpriced, along with the alcohol (what you'd expect), but it was interesting.",

Potato pancakes were tasteless, smashed flat, and served with cold applesauce, needs to be warm guys. I do not recommend them. 3. Bavarian Liver Mousse was tasty. Recommend.  4. The Munchner Weisswurste were good. Recommend.  5. Pretzel (accompanying 3 & 4) were previously froze and tasted freezer burned. They were NOT freshly hand-made whatsoever. Do NOT recommend.   6. Jagerschnitzel Pork Cutlet was dried out nd overcooked. The topped with creamy Mushroom Sauce, Bacon and Onions...where? It was a baby dollop of gravey.  Spatzle? Not even close to being cooked correctly. We were served soggy noodles. Highly DO NOT recommend.   7. HB Riesenbratwurst sausage was good, the bread Ok. Accompanying fries, Ok.  8. Our service was excellent and I tipped out waiter well.  9. The building was laid out like a bier hall, very nice. 10. Had three different biers, their tapped biers, all were good.",

We arrived and had a drink at the bar. Finally we went into the main room. There is a band in a very echoey room playing horrible versions American music. It is packed. Every table is full of drunk people. Every table was super packed... They seriously pack the people in here. I'm pretty sure they would fail if the fire Marshall came in. I couldn't get thru most of the 'walkways'. They just put a table in the middle of the walkway if the table wants to fit more people.   So we finally order and our food isn't very good. I guess this place is all about the beer and loudness. Basically you squeeze into the booth and are touching everyone around you while screaming to have a conversation or order. You are listening to HORRIBLE music. Then you eat food that is not good and pay too much for it all!   I will not be back!",

It's a family like environment. Don't expect booths and tables. There ain't none. It's a long wooden bench style where you can sit as many as 10 or more.   We ordered sausage, jumbo pretzel, and cheese pasta. The sausage pasta comes with a pretzel so don't order another like I did. But the jumbo pretzel was worth getting. It was soft and fluffy. The Swiss cheese pasta was unique. It's tastes like mac and cheese but even better.   This place can hold a big private parties like weddings. It's a nice place to bring the whole clan.",

The bands really do make the place festive and fun.  I have not yet been paddled but it also appears to be quite popular.  As far as the food, l only have eaten the pretzels and always spend the calories on the next beer.  The only negative is they sometimes do not have taxis waiting to take my drunk butt back to the hotel so I have crawl across the street to the Hard Rock and get a cab there.    Whenever we come to Vegas, its always the posts from the Hoffbrauhaus our friends consistently ask us about later - wanting to know about the party.",

It has 2 different rooms. One room has the band and look and feels like you're in a drinking hall and  the other one look and feels like you're outside.   Ordered the Schweinebraten, Munich roast pork, and the Nurnberger Rostbratwurst, roasted pork sausages and of course,a liter of Hofbrau original lager. It was so good. The roast pork was tender and perfectly seasoned. It was accompanied by bread pudding. The lightly seasoned bread pudding matched perfectly with the well seasoned pork. The dark beer sauce made everything come together deliciously.   The Nurnberger are 3 pork sausages matched with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The sauerkraut wasn't sour at all and the mashed potatoes were creamy. Yum!!  Finished the meal off with Apple Strudel, (Apfelstrudel). It's delish!! It tasted homemade. Vanilla sauce was with it. OMG!! So good!   I visited around 2:30pm, which is kinda after a lunch rush. German music was filtered, but no band. I need to come back probably around dinner and on a weekend for a more lively crowd.   Maybe visiting again for Oktoberfest?? Who's in?!?!",

The Schnitzel, Sauerbraten,and spaetzle we're amazing. I could not finish my meal as the entree plate was more than 12 inches in diameter and just full of delicious German food. I can't wait to have my apple strudel later tonight back at my hotel.  The atmosphere was very fun. The restaurant is family style with rows of tables and bench seating so you can really get to know your neighbors. The dining room is a large open hall with vaulted ceilings decorated with turn of the century German regalia with a live German band rocking the Accordion  This was the only drawback and the reason for 4 stars and not 5. At times it got quite loud and was hard to speak or hear the people next to me.  Since this was my first experience with German food the bar has been set High. I will definitely be recommending and returning to this restaurant.",

Aside from the Stein holding contest, I participated in everything mentioned in some fashion. It was so much fun I needed video evidence of the festivities (or maybe I just blacked out).  Despite a packed house and a noisy party going on at every corner, our server was attentive and very quick with our orders and food. I opted for the 2 liter boot, because why not, it's Vegas. I also started off with the soup which had a savory chicken broth accompanied with a giant meatball. It was so good I destroyed the meatball and gulped the broth down as fast as I could. For my main course, I had the Currywurst. I've never eaten a meal so fast in my life. I don't know if it was drunken munchies, or I was super hungry, but I should have choked to death that night. In any case, the curry was delicious, not too spicy or strong. I'm used to Thai and Indian curries, so I would have preferred it that way but it was amazing in its own right. I actually dipped my fries in the sauce so I could eat it all. In hindsight, should have asked if rice was offered here!  I cleaned up all my food, and was super satisfied. After all the shenanigans, I stumbled out happily with my drinking boot and a numb rear end. I can't wait to come back for more pleasure and pain!",

The ambience made me feel like I was back in Munich, minus the table dancing :)  I plan on returning to have a beer on 9/21. The have a selection for vegetarian folks but will warn that it's decent, not great. We had the vegan Frankfurter and schnitzel.   Stay away from the vegan schnitzel  It was just two gardein chickn patties -plain-...had nothing on top of it. No sauce. At the very least we should have had the mushroom sauce included but they charged us for that.   Not a big fan of that cause that charge comes off the servers tip (sorry - if you poke me, I poke back).  The Frankfurter was the better of the two. It came with fries and served in a curry sauce. With three people, 2 half liter beers, 2 vodka sodas, a big pretzel and three entrees the bill came to $120  The management response: Our server questioned 3x whether or not she charged for the right amount of beers. That was awkward. I said we only ordered once. Are you sure? Are you sure? Like well we are sure - so you get sure too :) up until that point she did a great job serving and gave recommendations as well for the beer and vegan dining.   Keep in mind I said I'm coming back.  I want to echo that the atmosphere is wonderful. And while I may not dine with them, I most certainly have no problem ordering beers and enjoying the music. Maybe some pomme frites :)  So 5 stars for Atmosphere / 4 stars for Management Response  / 2 stars for food / 3 stars customer service.  Overall experience is 3.5  stars (14/4).",

The waitresses all were dressed up in their German attire and were very friendly and helpful.  The entire restaurant consisted of bench tables with a live band. People would stand up on their benches, singing & dancing to the music! Such a lively atmosphere.  Beer was served in these huge 1 liter mugs. It definitely felt like a good old German social event! There was a guy bringing out a 9 foot horn and blaring it over the tables! Lots of things to enjoy watching!  The food was okay. German food consists of a lot of sausages and meat. The food was a little too salty for my taste. Minus 1 star for the food.   4 stars for the good service and entertainment. Everyone was very nice here!  Recommend for people who would definitely enjoy the German food + beer  + good music.",

    "text": "So we FINALLY came here for a co-worker's going away party...my first impressions of this place- big, busy, noisy, and tourist trappy.  Singing, dancing, and drinking the night away, while hearing the echoes of the dreaded wooden paddle coming in contact with someone's tush while others cheer on. Sounds like a great time!  On to the food...  Big Pretzel-Soft and chewy, loved the sweet onion sauce. Went well with my Original Brew. Pretzel too salty? Rub off excess salt! Problem solved...  Sauerbraten-Suggested by our waitress,(She states that EVERYTHING WAS SO GOOD!)the meat was soft but the spatzle and the sauce was salty. Vegetables we're too soft and mushy for my liking.  Apple Strudel- supposedly flew in from Germany like the big pretzel, I expected this to be delicious but that was not the case. The strudel dough wasn't crispy at all, and the filling was very gummy. IMHO, Price point does not match the quality of food served here. Maybe that's the way the food is supposed to be, but this is just my experience.  If I ever do return, it'll just be for the beers, pretzel and shenanigans. ALOHA!!!  SHAKA METER: \\uuu/  \\uuu/  \\uuu/  3",

The service was friendly and helpful, the entertainment was cool and the food was pretty solid. I love that I have this locally. To offer one slight criticism, They pound their schnitzel out pretty thin and mine was a little overcooked. Either don't pound it so thin or cook it less time. Other than that, I have no complaints.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this this place for a while now, and with family in town, I figured I would take the opportunity to do something pretty cool and unique to the local area.   Thou the restaurant is located in a interesting corner on Harmon and Paradise (note be aware of the one way only streets) and it being a Tuesday night, it seemed to have a lot of folks hanging out.   Food was pretty good, there are a diverse amount of both German and American food depending on one's taste's but wold recommend giving the German food a try. The one thing 2 of my family members told me was their mixed drinks seemed to be watered down but my wife said the beer was great.   The restaurant was laid out with communal seating  kinda like you would see at Oktoberfest. Being a Tuesday and kinda early, the restaurant was empty but the house band was there helping keep everyone entertained (gotta hang out for the chicken dance and some sing along)  I would say on my next trip I would be on a weekend evening when I assume the restaurant is at its busiest and check it out. All in all not a bad place to hang out for a night, have some good food, drinks and live entertainment. The kicker is, as long as everyone is participating with the show, this place can be a lot of fun.",

This is the second bad experience in a row.  Last time I was there I brought 10 people from UNLV.  Most of them for the first time.  I made the reservation online.  I thought that would be the most convenient for both me and the restaurant.  When I arrived there they put us in the back,  I didn't even realize there was a back.  Very different atmosphere from the beer hall.  We were festive mood and the back has a stale atmosphere.  We asked our waitress to move into the beer hall.  She told me she would ask her manager.  After not coming back, I went to look for and found her up front.  She told me the Manager said there was nothing she could do.  Rather than come back and tell us, she made me come find her.",

Now, in this town where you can get buffet at 25 bucks per person, you may question this overpriced mess, but ya know, it was actually good so, although I do think it is a bit overpriced, I was satisfied with a lot of things that I am wiling to overlook that.  We ordered the chicken schnitzle and the grillhendl entrees, and they were both very delicious. Each dish were super tasty and you can tell that it is prepared fresh (we didnt realize we were one of the last patrons prior to closing time). Service was super friendly and attentive. Food came out hot and prompt. The atmosphere and decor is what you would expect in a place like this - a bit rowdy, theres some music, and people are ready to drink and get spanked! lol.   Yeah, you get spanked with a paddle when you order a shot. So that was fun to see.   All in all, if you have a bit of loose change, I would suggest this place. But if youre more into bang for the buck, then there may be other less stellar places to go to - I mean, hey, this is Vegas!",

They have a gift shop up front, then a \"beer hall\" (similar to those I saw in Munich, though not quite that large), and then an indoor \"biergarten\").  We ordered the Braumeister special, the wurstplatte, and the grillhendl. These are all pretty authentic German and Bavarian fare.  The least appealing of the three was the wurstplatte, which is just a plate of sausages (at least one of which my wife said \"this is a hot dog\").  While I see why she thought that, it is a \"wurst\" (sausage).  I'm not a fan of brats, which was another wurst on her plate (she likes brats, so that was OK).  The grillhendl is chicken.  It was actually very tasty.  Mine was the braumeister, and came with spatzl.  I liked it.  It was simply, but flavorful.  Everyone seemed to like the beers they got.  And the server was very good, though he did disappear around the time we wanted the check.  I would probably go 3.5 stars here if I could.",

Yes this is very authentic German restaurant in Las Vegas! I love the beer garden with fake trees and terraces around. During summer it is too hot for seating outside so this is good effort to bring outside inside :) You should try \"Dunkel\" dark beer ... it is very light to drink in comparison to other dark beers like Guinness or Murphy's!  If you want a shot of German brandy, which is really strong but great, you might get spanked by waitress :) All in all great place for big groups and beer lovers!",

    "text": "Having eaten here many times I have come to a conclusion.  The schnitzel is just not good, as I ordered it a few times in the past and did not like it.  That of course, led to my not eating here for a long while, until recently when I tried it again.  The schnitzel was still terrible.  It is very heavily breaded and tastes like it has been sitting in oil.  Having eaten excellent schnitzel from San Diego to Munich and back, it is just not any good here, and I have given it plenty of chances.  That being said, other things are pretty good once I gave them a shot instead.  For starters, I love the giant pretzels, although to be fair, they are simply, giant pretzels.  I love pretzels.  Also, the sausages are tasty, as I enjoyed a sausage platter with a variety of wursts, and the potato soup is solid enough.  Down sides to this place are that it is super loud all the time.  I mean, super loud with the band playing and people shouting drinking songs constantly.  Also, it is expensive.  For what you get, it is pretty overpriced, although that is True of german food in general in town.  Bottom line, for a more festive and loud atmosphere with tons of beer and decent food, come here.  For more authentic and better german food, but without the party atmosphere and an almost depressing quiet in an older part of town, go to Cafe Heidelberg.  Both are pretty pricey, so they are almost a wash in regards to price.",

At times they have contests in which you can participate in. And the best part is the shots they serve. Goes down very smooth and mixes well with the beer.

And they have really huge beer mugs, and the live music can be fun.  But, after you've been here a few times, the novelty definitely wears off. You start to realize that the beers are priced easily twice what you should be paying, the food options are pretty bleak, and the music....meh, it gets a bit old.  Last time I wanted to go, it was a Saturday night and I knew it would be packed out so I made a reservation. Got there, followed the hostess in and what do you know, she seats my party at the one table that is furthest away from anything, a straight diagonal across the room from the stage. And there were a ton of empty tables that were closer! Her reasoning was absurd! So after one beer and a food order that they couldn't even get right, I summoned a manager and complained. She too, was perplexed as to why we were seated in the back, with a reservation. She took our food item off the ticket and apologized, which was nice, but the damage was done. So we finished our first and only round and left. Sad though, because it could've turned into a long night and a hefty tab, but I'm sure they didn't miss it because this place will always fill up with tourists like me.",

    "text": "Wow!  Let me start off by saying be prepared for quite the experience!    I love Vegas because two of my favorite things are in one place!  Eating and Clubbing! The Hofbrauhaus is a GREAT place for ridiculously delicious German food.  I had the schnitzel, because I mean, come on, you can't NOT get Schnitzel from a German restaurant.  When the plate came out, it was HUGE! OMG! Two people could have shared one and still had leftovers, it was that massive.  The schnitzel came with gravy and spatzle and my oh my, it was AMAZING!!  I've been to Germany and had Schnitzel, so this took me right back to Europe.  I'm so bummed that I couldn't eat the whole thing, but if you ever visit Vegas, this place is a must!!!  As for the experience I was talking about.  Seating is communal in the sense that their tables look like giant picnic tables where you can sit with your own party or join other groups of people.  The beer comes in these HUGE jars that are used for \"Prost\"-ing, which is the German term for \"Cheers\".  This act of saying cheers is slightly frightening when surrounded by a bunch of drunk people.  At the Hofbrauhaus, it's common for people to stand in their seats and when they \"Prost\" they slam their glasses together in the hopes of exchanging beer into each other's glass.  A forewarning, be prepared to leave drenched in beer with potential glass shards on your clothes.  When the energy level goes up in this place, it gets loud, rowdy, and chaotic!  In addition, when you order a shot of Jagermeister, after you take the shot, they use a large wooden paddle and, literally, spank you with it!  It's hilarious to watch after you've already had a few, but when you get paddled, don't expect to sit down right away!  With all that being said, if you're in Vegas and want the perfect place for a great time with great food and great company, this is most definitely the spot to hit!",

I had some friends in from out of town and with a little convincing, off we went. Loud music...check! Girls in fake German garb...check! $14 oversized and overpriced German beer...check!  I must say that even with all that I still had a nice time. The food was pretty decent and the people who worked there were nice. We had a shot girl come by and paddle our behinds (very hard) which added to the memory and the pain.  While I am not in a hurry to go back, I guess if you are looking for German food in a beer garden atmosphere, you could probably do worse. Let's face it also, there is no other choice within a few hundred miles :-) Oy oy oy!!!",

If you haven't figured it out, it's pretty much German food, so if you're into heavy meats, this is the place to go. Why 4/5 stars? We'll its a little bit on the pricy side ($20-$30) and it kind of took a while to get there. Maybe I was hungry but it just seemed like a while. It also gets pretty packed so make sure you make a reservation to save some time. Luckily for us, we did!",

    "text": "Once upon a time in a far away land there lived a boy that could celebrate Octoberfest no more than one month a year.  He would order seconds and thirds of his favorite schnitzel and bratwurst dishes, fill his gullet with authentic German bier till he couldn't walk and toast the night away with good friends as the polka band would play his favorite drinking songs.  He would wake up the next morning with a pounding in his head, his voice gone from singing at the top of his lungs and sounds of accordions and tubas resonating in his ears.  Just to do it all over again night after night until the festival was no more.  He would have to wait another long and uneventful eleven months until the magic would return. Until now.  The moment you walk through the door you can't help but smile and think to yourself,\"It's party time\" or in my case,\"lets get Fing Fed up\".  The band is rocking, or as much as a polka band could rock, the crowd is rowdy, and I mean dancing on top of tables rowdy and bent over getting spankings from jager girls rowdy. The waitresses have German accents, and I mean real accents, not BS fake medieval times accents.   Waiter: \"Would me lord wisheth more ale\" Me:\"Cut the crap Sir D Bag and get me a beer.\"   I also love how this place forces you to socialize.  You can't ask for a table for two and expect a quite romantic dinner.  Your seated at large picnic style benches perfect for standing and splashing beer on.    OK so now on to the food.  The dinners are not too pricey the couple times I have been I have spent about $16 a plate.  I usually get the Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl it consist of 3 pork sausages with sauerkraut, mash potatoes and gravy.  Dudes, believe me when I tell you, this stuff is absolutely amazing.  If you're only experience with bratwurst is something you get out of a package from your local piggly wiggly, forget everything you thought you knew and get ready for the pork epiphany.  Every bite you take will open new doors of flavor and flavor combinations.  If your anything like me and like to drink as much as you like to eat you will actually end up spending more money on beer than you will on food.  Last time I was there I had 3 liters of beer, one of the dunkelweizen, one of the hefeweizen and one pilsner.  The dunkel was my absolute favorite out of the three.  So all in all if your looking for a place to get rowdy, dance on top of the tables, take shots of jager, get spanking from jager girls as well as get a top notch meal in the mean time look no further.",

    "text": "Ah the Hofbrauhaus house. I've been to the Hofbrauhaus house several times and I'd say on every Vegas trip I go, I try to make it a point to go to this fine establishment. Mind you, the 4 stars may be misleading; I honestly can't remember the food too much, except on the way out sometimes.  The 4 stars has to do with the vibe of the restaurant, the amazing beer and the fantastic service.   The service is great; they encourage drinking and make sure everyone has a good time. A performer would come down to each table and drink beer with the table. I remember one performer telling us he loved his job - he gets paid to party with guests!   The beer is delicious. If you are looking for the Naughty Ice and the Paps of the world, this may not be the place for you. (In no means do I dislike naughty and Paps, they got me through college; but sometimes you want a change of pace). My favorite beer is the hofbrau original, but I've tried them all, and they are all top quality beer imported from Germany. They serve the beer in these huge liter glasses and gives you that European feel (So I've heard, although I've never been to Europe).  The best reason for the 4 stars is the vibe of the establishment. Everyone is merry, the music is jovial and the staff holds games throughout the night that you can play to win a glass or other prizes. Think chicken dances, holding your beer up the longest and spankings! The tables are the long type tables that force you to be cozy with your neighbors. I typically wouldn't like this, but the place has such a friendly atmosphere that it's really fun that way.  Man, writing this post makes me want to do a quick run to Vegas...",

    "text": "To sum up: authentic Bavarian restaurant located off the strip with huge beer and great food.  To elaborate: My very first trip here was for a friend's birthday extravaganza. My first thought when I walked in was BEER!!!! and lots of it. Now being a Bavarian place they don't offer light beer so don't even think about it. They offered Hefeweizen, Dunkel and a seasonal - which in this case was a dark wheat beer. If you're looking for large quantities of tasty libation this is the place to go - get the litre and be amazed at the size of the stein you get.   On to the food - if you like Bavarian (read: German) food, this is the place to be. I happen to be a fan, so I was in heaven and quite honestly was torn for a while. Oh the food was sooooooo good - you have GOT to freaking eat here if you like German food. Plus, the portions are HUGE! This is excellent drunk food - which probably says a lot about Germans...and the desserts look amazing. I was too full to try one though.  Bringing on the atmosphere - for all intents and purposes this place is an authentic Munich beer hall. They have family style long wooden tables and benches, there is a huge shelf along one wall loaded down with steins, and a guy comes in and plays live music and gets loads of audience interaction. This is a very enjoyable place to come and eat - it's a little pricey (look to spend at least $30 per person if you're drinking), but it's definitely worth it for tourists and locals alike. I can't wait till Oktoberfest to see this place come alive.  There are also spankings and contests. Be intrigued...",

    "text": "The Skinny: texturally offensive cafeteria food that had probably sat in a chafing dish all day (1), low cut, faux-German, dairy maid costumes does not constitute service unless you are at a strip club (2), overall value can only be justified if you've had way too much to drink (1).  Hofbrauhaus is a Disneyworld-esque German-styled building close to Hard Rock Hotel. I wanted to try this place out for a while because of the charming facade outside.  We decided to head there to eat because it was in my head that it would be like a mini-trip to a sanitized Germany without the pricetag.   When we entered, the place has the tired ambience of a hangover  complete with the loud, cacophony of a bad German folk band. Nobody was singing along with music, dancing or laughing... just downing a bunch of beer one after another.  Our waitress came by and took our orders dressed to... err... impress. She soon lost interest in our table however when we told her we weren't interested in alcohol. Ordered a Diet Coke/Pepsi which was not only flat but also tasted like there was some root beer mixed in there too.  I ordered the Sauerbraten which is supposed to be a roast pork dish with dumplings, vegetables and red wine sauce with red cabbage. We were surprised at how quickly the food came out of the kitchen. After we tasted our food , we knew why.  The food obviously was sitting under a heat lamp for way too long. Someone tried to disguise overly dry, salty pork with an overabundance of a lumpy, thick, red wine gravy. The dumplings were large, gummy and unappetizing. Vegetables were overcooked. The only thing that was okay on the dish was the stewed red cabbage.  My husband's schnitzel was dry and soggy. The gravy, it was swimming in, was bland. The potato salad was unpleasant, sour and overly warm.  This place is not cheap - a typical entree can be around the $20 mark - yet they do not provide you any value for your dollar given the quality of the ambience, service and food.",

We were seated in the main dining hall and I have to say that place is LOUD.  Its not a good place to have a conversation - as a matter of fact I applaud you if you can actually have a conversation over all that noise.  Even when the band isn't playing its noisy.  I was at the end of the table and had to have others repeat what the waitress was saying because I couldn't hear her from 6 feet away.  That being said its definately a fun drinking place.  The band mostly played German beer hall songs but sometimes they'd sneak in a Sweet Caroline or a Jimmy Buffett song.   We were a party of 6; we all ordered different things and we all were happy with our meals.  I'm not a beer drinker so I didn't sample anything but there seemed to be a good selection.  As others have said, it can be pricy depending on what you order.  I had a chicken sandwich and iced tea and my bill (incl tip) was just over $27.  Its not somewhere you'd go often but it definately has its place among eating establishments.",

As we pulled up into the parking lot, we were greeted by the horrible sounds of a band trying to play Margaritaville (which actually sounded like a bad rendition of Karaoke).  But being that one guest had lived in Germany, he wanted to see the Hofbrauhaus.    We were told by the hostess that it would be a 20 minute wait.  We asked for the \"beer garden\" area to get away from the music.  So we stood in the front bar area, chatted and watched some ESPN on the screens there.  After about 45 minutes, we grew impatient.    I walked into the hall to go to the restroom.  As I did I noticed the back area / beer garden was maybe 1/4 occupied.  All kinds of tables were open!!    I walked back to the front, and asked what the area was and the hostess said that is the beer garden.  When I asked about the number of open tables, she said - we dont have enough servers!!  (on a Thursday night before a weekend??)  We stayed for a bit, and then started to notice the staff's total lack of interest in customers, etc.  With this we left.",

Since I'm from Cincinnati, where just over the river we have an AMAZING Hofbrauhaus ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/hofbrauhaus-newport-newport-2?osq=hofbrau+house\">yelp.com/biz/hofbrauhaus...</a> ) I've been spoiled by awesome German food and liter beers.   This Vegas Hofbrau both lived up to the Vegas vibe and surprised me (they closed very early for Vegas) there was a good mix of live German and American music, which we all sang to. Delicious food and flowing beer taps. The waitresses were very nice and made us feel at home.   Sure, this was a little more expensive than I'm used to, but it's Vegas and the beer was just as delicious as I remember. If you're up for a fun experience give Hofbrau a chance and remember Liter beers only (Half liters are for wussies)!  Also, as an added Vegas bonus, if you buy a shot they'll bring it to you on a paddle and  even spank you if you're up for it. Only in Vegas!!",

It cost us over $80 for dinner for 5 people, and we ordered 3 meals to share (so, really, dinner for 3 + 2 beers). Service was on par with Denny's. There was a live band, but they were playing pop songs and things that folks could sing and shout along to. NO polka music, nothing German, Bavarian, or even remotely along those lines! We expected a different, more authentically German/Bavarian experience, more and better food, at a more reasonable price, and in a place where you could enjoy a conversation with your table-mates.

The beer was a bit too warm  The food wasn't bad, but some other locations I've been to have had better options. I won't be going back to this specific location.",

    "text": "A decent recreation of the food and atmosphere of the original in Munich. I went for lunch on a Saturday and was promptly seated. The food is not quite as good as what one gets in Munich and it is a bit overly salted. But the portions are generous and it tastes fine. The beer is good and the Yelp deal for a free 10 oz pour was all I needed. The coffee is clearly from a Keurig-style machine and has the distinctive Nescafe-like taste that comes with those. It's an ok place to visit but I'd come back mostly for the beer than the food.",

    "text": "Fun, funky restaurant and bar! Live music, spankings, beer, soft pretzels... It's all there!   The place is located just 2 1/2 blocks off the main strip of Las Vegas. Whether you are a local or just visiting for the weekend, it is definitely a place to check out. It's like most Bavrian restaurants - girls in barmaid outfits, long wooden tables family style, and beer steins.   Food - If you are going for appetizers only, get the soft pretzels or the potato pancakes. They are delicious and easy to share. As for the food, you can't go wrong! You have to order the spatzle - it's an egg noodle that tastes like potato dumplings. The breaded pork chops with mushroom cream sauce is my favorite!   Drinks - Good prices and the beer tastes good! But then again, when doesn't it? If you buy shots, the bar maids will spank you, two easy one, but the last one hurts. Be careful. :)  The only downside is that it gets REALLY loud at night. You may have to shout to speak to the person across from you! Definitely worth checking out!",

It was 144 dollars. I guess that's to expect in Vegas..probs should have avoided the tequila. Other than that liked it. Will be back. Just no more paddling. Lol",

You'll sing, you'll eat, you'll probably do the chicken dance, but you will eat some more, you'll laugh, you might cry (order a shot, go on!), but you'll eat more and love every minute of it! Be prepared, it is a loud place to be. Probably not intimate date night material. But so much fun!",

The Dunkel style beer is my favorite here, to me it has the most flavor then the rest of their beers. But try them yourself, they are all good. They serve them in different size: 16oz, 24oz and 34oz mugs.   Ask for the sausage sampler that come with a pretzel and two mustard and sauerkraut. At about $28; worth it. Their food, from the hamburger, to the Schnitzel, to the Sauerbraten, you can't go wrong here.   p.s. for every Jagermister shot you order, you get one spank in the ass with a large wooden paddle. Some spanks look and sounds like really hurts. So be warned.",

    "text": "I wanted to give them 5 starts but two things bothered me which is why I ended up taken half a star off for each \"thing\".  But let me start with the positive: I was born and raised in Germany and Munich/Oktoberfest was always high on our agenda before we moved here. So let me tell you this: food and drinks - authentic. They even served the seasonal \"Wiesnbier\" in the traditional 1l \"Mass\", which tasted exactly like the one we had in Germany (did not seem to be brewed here in the U.S. but really imported from Munich). We all had a \"Schweinshaxe\" (knuckle of pork), which the apparently only serve on Saturdays. The texture/taste was excellent: Crispy skin and juicy/tender meat (I wish they had the famous Bavarian hot mustard called Loewensenf). The traditional Bavarian dumplings were great yet they missing some gravy. I do not need to waste time on describing the ambiance: This is Vegas, everything looks great, bombastic and as realistic as possible. Bottom line - a fantastic, authentisch Bavarian brew house.  So why \"just\" 4 stars? Number one: The place is overpriced as both the Schweinshaxe and the Mass were more than twice as expensive than what you can expect in Munich even during the high-season/high-priced Oktoberfest weeks. So whatever you paid - cut it in half, subtract another 25% (tax and tip are included in Germany) and you get an idea what you would have paid in any of the plenty Munich \"Bierkeller\" (brew houses). And number two: Not just that they charge you much more for the Schweinshaxe, they also just give you half (!) of it. They cut one in the middle and my wife got one half and I got the other (easy puzzle as we sat right next to each other). This is not happening in any of the Bavarian places. You pay for one (!) Schweinshaxe, you get one Schweinshaxe. Anyways, I guess they just adopted quickly to U.S. capitalism :-).  Bottom line, I would go back the next time I am in Vegas but if I was living there it would not be my every week dining place.",

For a German restaurant the beer was a C in taste and a D- in selection, and again overpriced.  But aside from typical restaurant reviews, this was truly a bizarre experience. Soon after getting drinks, a photographer came by and told -- not asked -- my guest and I to sit together so she could take a picture. She came back just after we got our food with our photo in a kitschy magnet selling for $10. I might have predicted this, but I wasn't prepared for the surliness of the photographer when we declined, since we were looking for a bite to eat, not posing in front of the Bellagio with a fanny pack and a noseful of sunscreen.  There was spanking... with wooden paddles, by waitresses in busty St. Pauli Girl-style dresses, which somehow seems just a shade off of an authentic German restaurant experience, if that's what the restaurant was going for.   The spanking periodically generated loud whoops and chants from fratty guys, which was distracting only if you happened to be paying attention to the band, which played the Chicken Dance, Abba, the Star-Spangled Banner, and Sweet Caroline, in that order. Our waitress excused herself at our drink order to link arms with her nearest colleague when the chicken dance played.   Very bizarre. If you love feeling like a tourist, you'll love this place.",

We didn't have to wait for a table and were able to settle right in.   There was an awesome band playing. The crowd was completely engaged, singing along, dancing, just all out having a great time.  The atmosphere here is fun, fun, fun.   I had the Hefeweizen and it was everything a good German beer is supposed to be. Smooth with subtle hints of spices. Best beer I had in Vegas. My hubby had the seasonal offering and he said it was a damn good beer.   We started with a pretzel and a cucumber salad. The pretzel was huge, warm and perfectly salted. It comes with two kinds of mustards and cheese for dipping. Perfect with our beer. The cucumber salad was light and refreshing.   We also shared the breaded jagerschnitzel. The portion was definitely shareable. I could not have finished it on my own. It was as good as what I cook at home.   Our server was Freedom, she didn't rush us even though it was the end of the night.   We will definitely be adding this to our must stops when we are in Vegas. Not glitzy, but great service, fun atmosphere, delicious German beer and authentic tasty German food. I need nothing else to be a happy girl.",

(There is a quieter section which you can ask for, but why?)  3. The dining room is made up of huge tables, which means that unless you have about 8 in your party you will be sharing a table.  4. You will be encouraged to drink.  5. The food is mediocre.  6. The beer is outstanding (and I don't like lagers much!) , and the only size it's served in is liter (don't order one of those smaller sizes). 7. You may get paddled (sometimes to the point where your arse is black and blue the next morning). 8. You will need to stand on your table and participate in the singalongs.  9. Apple schnapps goes down very easy and has little alcohol. 10. You go here to have a raucous good time.  The only real downer is the service can be a tad slow, but only once (out of the 10 or so times I've been here) has it been overly bad.  (Closed circuit to the 45 people who said there was \"No Alcohol\" - Which Hofbrauhaus in a parallel universe were you going to?)",

    "text": "I came here with friends and wanted to like this place, but it just didn't do it for me.  Five reasons to not inflict this farce on yourself:  1. The food is bad - it's like a German Denny's (thank you Shannon F):  Salty overcooked sausages and spam type meats layered on mushy vegetables.  For $20+ an entree no thanks.  2. The beer is bad - wtf?? A \"German\" restaurant with only 3 horrible horse piss Miller Lite tasting draft options?  How can this be?  You are offered three house draft options: light medium or dark - I went with dark and it was probably the worst Germanic or European beer I have ever had.  There are many bars in Vegas with a hugely better selection, Gordon Biersch, the Freakin Frog and the Yardhouse all come to mind.  3. The great big echoing hallway style room is loud - and wait til that godawful Oompa band starts up.  You won't be able to make conversation with or hear your friends, which can really be a negative in a dining experience.  And the band itself is not that good - sharp and brassy with too much piercing horn, not subtle or refined.  Accordions!?  They were like toddlers given a whistle: look I can make the dog cry with my earsplitting melodies!  Maybe if you were sh_tfaced it would serve as music - but how can you get there with the beer tasting like donkey sweat?    4. There is a gift shop in the entrance.  I am not a fan of restaurants with gift shops.  Esp when they come with a heaping side of bad food, bad drinks, and bad music.  5. I was expecting a higher quality experience.  I suppose if you were drunk or high - hey it's right next door to the Hard Rock, most probably are - it would be passable.  Sadly I wasn't.",

We made a reservation for 8:30 on a saturday and walked right in when we arrived.  The first thing you notice is the HIIIIIGH ceilings and how loud it is. If you are looking for a quiet place to eat, skip this place or sit in the room in the back which is much quieter, but you can still hear the music. Next time I go, I'd like to sit back there because it is made to look and feel like an outdoor garden seating area and it looked just lovely.  But this time we sat in the front room. The band played a mix of fun german singalong songs and american rock. They even played the  Star Spangled Banner and one point and everyone was singing. Very cool.  The prices were reasonable for a Vegas dinner. A friend and I split a sandwhich which was around $16 and the beer I had was $7.50. The more elaborate meals and larger beers are a bit more money, so plan on about a $30 meal.  Anyplace that let's me stand on the chairs (bench) to see the stage is OK by me!",

Dance on the tables? Sure.  Holding up your stein glass without a care of spilling it on anyone.? Absolutely.  Laughing and shouting with everyone having a good time in their own drunken stupor? You bet.  I'm brown so I eat rice a lot.  Needless to say, I am a German Food virgin.  The German speaking boyfriend recommended I try the brat and sauerkraut --yes! I have never had a brat!! So I tried the Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl.  It was tasty, and I can do without the sauerkraut but I much preferred the boyfriend's savory dish- some kind of Schnitzel... shcnotzel...i have no idea.  Just ask for the breaded whatever with the vinegary potato salad :)  This place isn't for you if you despise loud dining establishments.   Come only if you feel like dancing on tables (go-go dancing experience not required!) and having loads of loud fun.  Fun events?  Stein Holding contests and Oktoberfest beer.  Hurry up and try this place!   Das ist wunderbar!!! The only German phrase I know :)",

In other words, at least 0.2 blood alcohol level already from the neighboring establishments.   I came here with my cousin after seeing the new Alice In Chains at The Joint, and we were relatively sober and hungry. Bad choice. Place was banging (Saturday night, naturally) and it was hard to get servers' attention.   I would give the Brau another chance, maybe the timing was off. Maybe we should have just gone back across the street, got hot dogs, pounded Jager,  and peed on the Body English line. I'll definitely come back for lunch. Since Joyce is from Guam. And I'm from Guam. Score!",

    "text": "So I made another trip here during the 2009 CES, and it was just as fun as ever.  It was just as lively as before, and the band did an excellent job of making this place a fun and entertaining evening for us.  At some point in the night, the band announced that a very special guest would be coming in soon, but we had no idea what to expect... (more on that later)  So my friend and I ended up with the jagerschnitzel, which is a fried and breaded pork dish that also came with some spatzle (handmade German pasta).  Not as big as my meal last time I was here, but still very good.  The one thing that is cool is that instead of bringing bread to the table, they bring out a soft pretzel and several dipping sauces.  The pretzel was very good, and for me, just the regular mustard was good enough.  Our other friend got another dish that was all sausage, and that looked really good too.  Our waitress was very fun, and came by to check up on us regularly, but not to a point that it got annoying.  She also noticed that my friend and I both had a bunch of cameras out, and told us that the \"special guest\" was about to arrive, and we should rush the big double doors before anyone else got there.  The doors open, and it's none other than David Hasselhoff!  So he comes in with a camera crew, my friend and I are busy snapping up pictures, everyone is rushing the area he is walking, and he makes his way to the band area.  He talks a little, and then starts signing \"Freedom\", and says that he is happy to be at the HOFFbrau haus.    It was definitely an enjoyable evening, and I think we will start to make the Hoffbrau Haus as one of our CES traditions.",

The first time I was there for lunch - this was at least 7 years ago, their mashed potatoes tasted like they were from a box and their saurcraut was fresh out of a can and not properly rinsed.  Just went for their Oktoberfest  celebration. I was excited and hopeful that their food had changed.  Nope. Ordered a large pretzel  to share.  Pretzel came out cold and a bit hard. I was excited tho for their currywurst  since I have been craving it since I left Germany. I've had about 8 currywursts in my life and this was the most disgusting currywurst ever. How can you mess up a street cart food like currywurst?! Also they cut up an American hotdog and placed it on top of my fries  for some unknown reason. I'm not ever going back.  I can get my fix of good German beer from the local liquor stores and if I am craving German food I'll go to the Berlin Cafe.",

    "text": "The atmosphere seems a bit Disneyfied, though I have it on reliable authority that, while much smaller, it more or less approximates a genuine beer hall in the Bavarian tradition.     The food is good. If you like sausages, you should be quite happy; even the salad comes with them.  The briny half-chicken is above average, the schnitzel is enormous, and the large pretzels are, unsurprisingly, great with the liters of German beer.  They have a bar, but the beer is obviously what to stick with if you want to be properly in the spirit of the place.  The dunkel gives you more flavor for your $14/L.   You can fortify it with shots of schnapps that the dirndl-clad army of waitresses will tempt you with approximately four times an hour.    There are two areas, both indoor; a large one where live music plays and a second, somewhat smaller room that is decorated as faux beer garden.  This is where a little luck comes into play; if you arrive at a good hour, you'll not only get a table in the main room, but also you'll be surrounded by people who know the customs of beer hall songs and toasts.  Without this unpredictable element (if you're not bringing your own with you), your time at the Hofbrauhaus can easily fall short of mine.    Expect to pay indulgence prices; you'll be lucky to get out under $85 per person with beer and dessert.",

The company I used to work for would always put together at least one night here during CES, so I have been here on numerous occasions.  Good German food with nice portions...as authentic as it gets (for Vegas).  Strong drink and heavy drinking clientele complete with friendly \"beer wenches\" who keep bringing you more.  Friendly and very lively crowd gets louder, drunker, and wilder as the evening goes on.  Nowhere else in the nation have I seen so many drunken customers dancing on tabletops.  Yikes...other lesser restaurants would be terrified of the liability, but not here in this authentically genuine Bavarian beer hall.  Pretty cool and always a fun time to be had while drinking, eating, and watching all that is going on around you.  And watch out for those paddles that they spank customers with!",

For German mastication, 1 star is plenty. The food is mediocre at best and I've left hungry after each of the two times I ate food here. I'm a big guy, but there are entree salads I've had elsewhere that are much more filling than the schnitzel plates I ate here. The food isn't inedible, but there are far better places in town for authentic and filling german fare.  Now, for a rowdy night of beer drinking and paddling, this place earns 4 stars. Steins of light and dark house beer are rampant as is the stereotypical German drinking songs performed by whoever is on stage. As for the house beers, I prefer the dark; flavorful, aromatic and just bitter enough to turn me away from vodka for the evening. If not, there's always Jager to fall back on. Watch out for the ladies with paddles and either avoid them or give them a holler, depending on how red you'd like your bottom to be at the end of the evening.  All in all, if a night of beers and watching others getting their groove on in full lederhosen is what you crave, this is the place to be.",

Let me start off by saying the atmosphere was great, live German music, great service and they had a fun clientel. The food was good, not fantastic, but definitely good (which is the only reason why they do not get a five).  The table next to us had a group of about a dozen Austrian bikers. We clinked glasses and exchanged pleasantries, however on closer inspection they may have been a little bit too friendly, because as we left there were a few too many lingering and disappointed looks, as if they had just seen dessert taken off of the menu!

And that is coming from some people who love beer (my friends), and others (Jason and myself) who usually don't care for many types of beer. That was the highlight of the experience for us as far as I was concerned.   The room was way too noisy to hold a decent conversation, but as the theme of the restaurant seemed to be \"drink beer and get drunk\", I guess I will let that slide. The waitresses were forced to wear these god awful costumes that were suppose to make them look like German bar maids but really just made them look frumpy, whether they were or not. And there was one poor decrepit 40 something who looked like she had prematurely aged due to partying to look more like she was 60, walking around with shots of Jager and a paddle that she was suppose to smack your ass with after you took a shot.  Now the food would have been good if it was served on a plane, but that's about in the quality range that I found it to be. They came out with the plastic covers on them which indicated that they had just been heated up and sent out for us rather than prepared fresh, and upon tasting there was no doubt. The mashed potatoes were the instant kind, my chicken breast was a flattened out patty of a thing, definitely frozen and refrozen a couple of times, and the gravy tasted like it came from a powder.   They did have a good soft pretzel that they served with an awesome cheese dip, but at $10 for a pretzel, I could pass it up.   My friends really liked the place though, even though one of them got the same exact meal that I did, only with beef rather than chicken... Maybe I am just expecting too much. Then again, he did have twice the amount of beer that I did. Maybe that's the secret to enjoying this place.   I would come here again, but only to have the beer.",

We didn't have to wait very long to get to our spot in the corner of the large beirhall. We were in the back and I think when we go back, I'll request seat farther up front, so I can hear the band better. And get a front row seat to the chuggin' contests and be able to actually see the birthday boys and girls who get pulled on stage to play with the band.   Our server was a hoot. Very friendly and quick with everything. I enjoyed reading \"the news\" in The Hofbrauhaus Times while we waited for our food. Who knew that Vegas harbors an \"underground Bavarian community\"?!  As a vegetarian, I was wary (I lost about 6 pounds in the week I stayed in Austria). Not a heap of option, but something (look for \"Vegetarian\" section of the menu or ask your server).   We shared the giant pretzel and I really enjoyed slathering the butter/cheese mixture onto the piping hot thing. Me & the Mr. split the Allgauer Kasespatzle, which is akin to mac'n'cheese. Not very flavorful, but it was filling. With all the bread and cheese, though, I thanked my stars they served a salad, or else I might have plugged up, if you know what I mean.   Oof.",

    "text": "This place was quite a disappointment. I'm a Vegas local and after many years of driving past this place, finally decided to eat here. Made a reservation for 10pm and got there a bit late. We were told that the bar and kitchen was closing the moment we got there so we had to order quickly. Everything was rushed and the place was pretty much empty. Guess the staff really hates staying late. Food was okay, but nothing spectacular. Our pretzel was hard as a rock. Almost inedible. I got this sausage sampler and most of the sausages were cold and tough and one had a bone fragment in it. The busser came and cleaned off our table before we had completely finished eating..extremely rude. We were told they were closing in 10 minutes and they made our dessert to-go. Overall, not the best experience regardless of whether or not it was before close. You don't want people coming in late, don't allow them to make reservations and then rush them through eating. I now consider this place a tourist trap and would not recommend it to locals. Food was overpriced and lackluster.",

If you are looking for a loud and fun atmosphere that is different from your typical night club scene in the big hotels, this venue will meet your needs.  I  especially like the traditional German folk band playing and audience participation.  The food is mediocre but the beer and atmosphere will make up for that.",

The service was good, the entertainment was WAY to loud, and we raised our steins about 15 times during the course of dinner.  The cheese appetizer was good, but could have done without the tower of sausage (or whatever they called it) - too expensive for what you get - better off just ordering dinner plate to share with the table!  This is a great place for a birthday or celebration, chances are someone at your table will make an ass out of themselves.  All the food was good, and cooked just right.",

I was first informed nothing was available near the band as requested and the back of restaurant was our only choice. I refused and spoke to another host who made an effort to accommodate us who also located our \"lost\" reservation. Our eventual table was in a great location. Our next issue is the server who was almost non-existent.  She was too busy trying to hook up with a guy sitting on the opposite side of our table. It was a very disappointing evening. The only bright spot was the beer and the band.",

    "text": "I've been here many times and have never been disappointed. Things to know, it's reaaaalllly loud, fairly expensive, and the food isn't necessarily outstanding. They have large tables, so if you have a small party you will likely be expected to share a table with strangers. With that being said, it's the ambiance that keeps us coming back. It's a very large restaurant with a boisterous and interactive live polka band, with waitresses in costume, where dancing on the table is encouraged!   There were two of us on a Monday at 730pm and we were seated immediately at a table with another couple halfway through their meal. I've been here before on weekends and have had to either make a reservation or wait for a table.   There were four types of beer to choose from and multiple sizes, though I must say the liter of beer is the way to go! Fun fact- if you purchase a shot of liquor they insist on swatting your behind with a large wooden paddle. They will line you up, make you bend over onto the table and smack you as hard as they can. It is outrageously painful but extremely hilarious!   I had the vegetarian noodle dish, which seemed like their spin on macaroni and cheese. It was a very rich blend of elbow macaroni like noodles, Swiss cheese and onions. The portion was large and tasty, I ended up bringing half home. It comes with a side salad, which they failed to serve me. However I am just realizing this now as I look at their menu.  We also ordered the grilled chicken breast with mushroom sauce and home made noodles. Also rich, but tasty.   Be sure to check out the free photo booth stand in the back of the restaurant near the restrooms and beer garden!",

It's fun for all ages and most nights you don't have to wait 45 min for a table like some other restaurants, because the hall is so big. The bratwurst and pretzels are really good. Tonight I tried their pot roast, also a good choice. Black Forest Chocolate Cake is also a must. It's one of my favorite places in Vegas and a short drive or Uber ride away. It's as close to Germany and a year-round Oktoberfest as you can get. Don't miss it! A+ for service, all our servers have been attentive, gracious and kind.",

    "text": "Been just recently back to the Hofbrauhaus and we were so disappointed this time. The waitress was very rude and could not handle a customer that actually says if she made a mistake. We told her 5 times what we want to order and it still came out wrong. When we complaint, she said she's not serving us anymore. Well I guess she's not made for this business! The Brezel was really good, but the Jagerschnitzel was a disaster. I know the Schnitzel is huge, but the Jagersauce was a little spot on my Schnitzel. Not to mention, I'm German and lived in Germany 33 years, a Jagerschnitzel comes covert in gravy!  On top of that I was not able to choose my side. When I called my mom in Germany and told her that, she almost freaked out. If you want French fries, they make you add this to your order and charge you extra. Those Spatzle that came with it were bland and fried to death! I ordered also a Bananeweizen with my stuff, every German knows what a Bananaweizen is, a Weizen with Bananajuice. I was so excited, haven't had one in a long time. The waitress brings me a cocktail. Hello, what is that?  Your Bananaweizen! I don't think so, you can take that back with you. I might live here, but you're not selling me something like that.  Never again I will try to eat at this place. You might fool people that never been out of this country, but you'll not fool me again. For such a pricey place I expect a good, correct and authentic food.",

The part that makes this place not so amazing, are the food and the prices.  BUT DUH, IT'S VEGAS so OF COURSE it won't be......look, if you want affordability in Las Vegas, LEAVE THE STRIP.  THERE!  Back to the review.  The food is there but it doesn't shine.  Either the meat is not juicy enough, the vegetables seem too artificial, or there isn't that touch or flare of German \"family\" added to the food.  When you've tried enough German food, you'll understand what I mean.  And for what you paid for, I had a slight feeling that I lost more money than what I spent at the Hofbrauhaus.  However, the drinks don't fail, nor does the band in getting people involved in having a good time.  It's a great first time experience.  Probably because it's in Vegas, as mentioned earlier about not having that German \"family\" flare, there isn't enough at this place that makes you want to come back over and over.  It's not a nitch location for good times.  It's like watching an awesome show at an amusement park where the right elements are in front of you and at the table.  But in the wonderful world of food and venue exploration, you find sometimes that no matter how bad the drinks or the food, it's the engagement and that connection that really brings customers and places together.  Unfortunately this place does not have it BUT, it has all the right ingredients and nevertheless, it is a fun experience.",

There is parking at back although I am not sure which belonged to them and to a hotel located in the same block. A signed indicated that a Valet was available, but I did not see one when I was there, so I guess it is only available at certain hours. The dinning hall is one big room with vaulted ceiling, kind of the those in Europe. My party had a variety of sausage dishes. I had the pork sausage (I could not pronounce the name) paired with an ever safe heff. One of our party had a Jagersnitzel (with the Mushroom sauce). I enjoyed the different sauces for the sausage as well as the Mushroom sauce for the snitzel. I was less impress with the pretzel, which they claimed as a giant pretzel. It fit a regular plate, and I have seen larger ones. Over all this was one of the better German food I tried, the price is somewhat on the high side though. I think they have lunch deals, so that might be something to try at another time.",

Yes there is a pretty smokin hot lady(a little on the older side) who will paddle you if you order a shot of Jaeger from her, but you don't have to do that....just ask your server, and you can have all the paddle-free Jaeger you want.  We had the special smoked platter, which had smoked pork loin, a wiener and a sausage, with cabbage and mashed potatoes.  It was about $20.00  The smoked pork loin was really, really salty....other than that, the food was great.

Star 1: How was the service and atmosphere?  Friendly, yes, and the food came relatively quickly, but I was admittedly a bit miffed by the \"show\". Yes, at times the dining atmosphere during Oktoberfest can loosely resemble the show you see at Hofbrauhaus, but this is very rarely the case. That having been said, I think you come to Hbh knowing what you're getting yourself into, and knowing what you're paying for. Star Granted.  Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  Why is it that German food has been turned into this expensive anomaly everywhere outside of the homeland? Schnitzle? Fries? Spaetlze? This isn't expensive stuff, so as you can imagine, I was a bit deterred by the $30 price tag on my Pepper Steak with Wedges:  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=dZXCmhBNt2XPcZeuIMwnjg&userid=OKX-V5j_qfuOebeHeWGrHg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  That's an awful lot to pay for a dish that was 50% gravy. No Star Granted.  Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  The Pepper Steak was without question good, but I couldn't help but feel as though a vast majority of the flavor was coming from the gravy as opposed to the actual steak. Single Star Granted.  Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  I love love love love love German Food, but if you're jacking up your prices because of a carnival-esk atmosphere as opposed to food quality, you're doing it wrong. No Star Granted.",

However, if you have a free beer coupon, don't expect to get much, you still have to spend big money on a meal to get a 10oz beer. Yep, a little tiny beer, not one of those large mugs.  The food was ok. It was extremely salty. The beer was... well... beer. For sure wasn't worth $20 for a liter.  Oh, and if you want to drink it out of the \"das boot\", expect to pay even more, those boots are extra. (side note: my server mentioned the gift shop and told us that as servers, they're required to sell retail or they get fired.)  They do spankings. A full on spanking with a wooden paddle on the behind.  All you have to do is buy a shot. Crazy.  But OMG that s**t hurts!!  Those girls seem to have a lot of pent up aggression. The guys aren't too nice either. Expect a bruise for a souvenir.  This wouldn't be a helpful review if it didn't include the employees: The host(s) look pissy.  Not very friendly and sure as hell didn't make the place feel welcoming. The server(s) are sad.  They may smile at you and speak to you all positively and happy, but have you ever just people watched a server? The servers at this place walk around looking miserable.  They don't look happy.  The random man standing against the wall. Seems important, but looks like a jerk. Doesn't smile, doesn't socialize, and looks like he's looking for something to go wrong. He was on his phone  the whole time except when he'd wander in and out of the kitchen. The manager(s) are usually the easiest to find. The ones who hold down the fort. The one manager I noticed was a guy who seemed to run around frantically the whole night. He should have been the calmest of the entire bunch.  When you see this kind of DEPRESSING CHAOS in a business, you have to wonder where it's coming from. It doesn't just come from us customers.    I don't think I'll be returning by personal choice. I would much rather go somewhere with a better vibe that doesn't empty my wallet.",

The Hofbrauhaus here in Las Vegas is a rather good and authentic representation of the original Munich Hofbrauhaus, coming close in its atmosphere, food and music, although it is sometimes hard to find a quite table to talk when the live music is playing.   The only thing that might keep reminding you that you are not in Munich is that barely any of their service personnel speaks German not even to mention Bavarian.   I'd still recommend the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas to everyone who seeks authentic Bavarian Beer and Food as well as a touch of Bavarian \"Gemutlichkeit\"",

My table was ready for a trip to the fatherland. Germans looking for German fare. We all agreed we should of gone with the sausage tower and beers. Kept it simple, meat, beer and pretzels. No brainer. Alas, that was not choice we made.   I ordered the Bayerische Spezialitaten Platte: A giant platter with smoked pork loin, pork roast, smoked sausage, dark beer sauce, sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The meat was cooked, though bland. The sauce was wet, and make things around it wet too. the mashed potatoes were mashed, you did not need teeth to eat the roast. Its what it said it was, sans robust flavors.   My companions ordered Currywurst and the Sauerbraten.  The Currywurst: Two grilled Krainer sausages topped with a delicious curry sauce and served with French fries. Or sausage with ketchup mixed with bbq sauce and a hint of curry.  The Sauerbraten, to quote: It wasn't bad. Very Minnesota.  In short, it wasn't bad, it wasn't great.

Service is a bit brusque and abrupt; I guess they are trying to act Germanic.  The food is OK, but it is mass produced.  Not high quality by any means.  When our food came out, and you need to eat a schnitzel while it's hot, the band immediately struck up the Star Spangled Banner.  We all, of course, stand and face the large flag.  The performance dragged on while our food got cold.  I am all for patriotism, but this seemed a bit strange.    Next, a guy at another table wanted to be spanked by the large waitress.  OK, this is their schtick. I get it.  Well, it was right at us while we are eating.  Then the waitress turns to us and makes comments about the guy she spanked; really, we do not care!

    "text": "Wife and I had this on our radar/bookmarked for the last couple of visits to Las Vegas. When we found ourselves looking for something on a Saturday evening in September (not during Oktoberfest) we thought we would visit. We arrived at 9:30 on a Saturday Night, the place was not too full. No reservation and no wait.  We sat down and were waited on immediately by a wonderful waitress. We ordered two large beers, one original and one Dunkel and a pretzel with beer cheese. The beers were good but average in taste with the Dunkel preferred by both of us. The beer selection was not as extensive as we assumed it would be. The pretzel was light and fluffy and above average. The sausage platter was also just average with 4 smallish sausages that if it were not for the beer were just average and not exploding with tastiness. Then we had the apple strudel which should be called dough (although imported from Germany) with just a few apples and a ton of too rich and way too sweet sauce on top.  The best part is the atmosphere. You certainly feel transported away with the decor and the live oom pah pah music. The waitress wore attire that tried to look like a dirndl but it missed or never \"lifted\" and a few male waiters, but not all, wore lederhosen.  All said and done we would return for the atmosphere.",

    "text": "My wife and I went here back in January and had a great time.  We went kind of early so is wasn't packed or extremely loud like some reviewers have posted.  The atmosphere overall was nice,  we were seated at a table by ourselves since it wasn't very crowded at the time.  My wife ordered Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte (Sausage Platter) and I got the Schnitzel Wiener Art (breaded Veal cutlet) and we shared for some variety.  Both plates were delicious,  we would have devoured it all but the servings were big so there was some food left over.   The beer was good and cold, we both ordered the large mug (I think it was a liter).  I participated in a beer chugging contest for a free mug and came in 2nd out of 10.  No free mug but it was free to participate.   There was not a band playing while we were there but there was a solo guy providing some entertainment,  he also coordinated the chugging contest.  If you order any shots, prepare to get swatted with a paddle.  Not sure if they do that in Germany or not but it was funny for everyone else to see and drew their attention when it cracked.  The only down side to this place was the location.  It was off the main strip so far, probably took us 20-30 minutes to walk each direction.  Not a big deal as we needed the exercise anyway after trying to eat all that food, would consider taking a taxi next time.    Overall we had a great time here and will go back next time we go to Vegas.  Will probably go a little later to experience the full band and lively crowds.",

I think this is a fun place if you're with a group.  I don't think it be great if you're solo or a couple..you need a gang of folks to fill up a table and it seemed like most people had a table and pretty well stuck to themselves.",

    "text": "Ok, I have been to the real one in Munich several times and I have to say that it is my favorite place in the world to sit with friends, eat some good food and have the best beer in the world! The Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas is a fun place to take some friends and I would recommend it to most people, but it does fall short of the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany.   First, the bad: its pricey!!! $15 for a beer? In Germany it was less then $6 (US) but its Vegas and they are selling an experience so I get it. It cost us $180 for 4 people to eat dinner... wow, but again its Vegas. My only issue with the price is that the servers don't come around all that often so you must flag them down when you see them or you may not get another chance. Also, I didn't appreciate that after the 2nd refill on her Iced Tea my friend was told she would be charged for the next one? Seriously? At these prices she should be able to drink as much Tea as she wants.   The Good: Its a fun party environment. Especially on the weekend! I love the euro style dining experience in the main hall because as you drink and sing along with the band (which can be a little loud) you can't help but to meet some interesting people. The garden section is also available for the more intimate dining experience and isn't nearly as loud!  Also, the food is very True to the dining experience we had in Germany. Was it as good as Munich? Maybe not, but how many German places can you find in Vegas? Fact: Google lists 7! HB, Cafe Eidalvice (SP) and 5 Weinerschnitzels... so it was good enough!   Overall its a fun place to go every now and then, but you can also find a better dining experience for the money (think Mortons). As a substitute for flying to Munich, its totally worth it.",

    "text": "Again, it's just not the same (read my review on Carnegie Deli in Las Vegas). I've been to the real one, and hoped that this one would compare. And well...  Let me just say that in the real Hofbrauhaus, I could order pig's knuckle (which sounds pretty grim, but trust me.... it's the best of pulled pork and chicharones). Their beers were flowing like none other except in Munich. I couldn't understand a word of what was going on around me but that added to the festivity.  Here, I had to settle for their sampler (combination plate?) of a sausage, and some cuts of meat. It was good, but not terrific. It was overpriced too...  Their beer was ok... I tried the Maibock when I went. Again, it was good, but still missing something. The atmosphere was good. It was relatively empty since I went during lunch. Their performer was really entertaining. He really saved the entire meal. (I bet the dinner atmosphere is a lot more entertaining when everyone is drunk off their asses).  Then somewhere along the course of my lunch it hit me--I'm not in Munich. It's another one of Vegas' facades. Like the Eiffel Tower at Paris compared to the real one, or New York New York to the real Big Apple, I can't keep making these comparisons to their real brethren.  So I sat back, enjoyed my meal for what it was (though still only 2 stars), and drank to remember and to forget.",

    "text": "I came here for a drink one night already drunk on food (see my review for India Palace).  I never made it into the dining hall other than a quick pass through on my way to the restroom (stay tuned for more on that).  Instead I stayed at the bar since I was there for the beer after all.  When presented with the sizes, my friend and I looked at each other and looked down the bar at a lady with the large liter size beer.  Being men and not wanting to be out done by a lady, we both ordered the liter size of a dark beer as well.  We were already full so those beers took a long time to drink.  He was the first to visit the restroom in the back.  I followed suit a few minutes later.  The quick trip through the dining hall was entertaining.  People sitting at community tables singing and laughing.  Drinking and eating.  Live music playing traditional German tunes as well as more contemporary songs on traditional German instruments.  Sweet Caroline in oom-papa style was hilarious.  It looks like a fun place to eat and be basically part of the show.  I'd like to go back just for that.  Anyhow, I make my way back to the bar from the restroom, take my seat and resume my drinking.  Then I notice, my friend is not there anymore.  I figured he went back to the restroom and I missed him.  So I waited a few minutes and he never came back.  Finally I asked the bar tender if he had seen the guy I came in with.  I got a funny look followed by \"oh, you're serious.\"  For the last ten minutes he was sitting just one stool over and talking with another bar patron.  Both men are ex Air Force.  I felt pretty stupid at this point.  All I could do was laugh and wonder if I was really that drunk.  It was not long after that that I finished my beer and was ready to head home.  The rain of the evening had let up, I was tired and had a long drive to Arizona the next morning.  After paying the barkeep and calling out the BS-ing former Air Force stranger on some of what he was saying therein nearly starting a fight, I made it to my car, made it home and made it to bed.  What an evening.",

The food, not bad, typical American German beer garden fare. Couldn't tell you exactly what it was that we ate as it was already ordered for the group but, we had the pretzels (Damn good), a sliced meat plate (ehh) a sausage plate (so so, some of them looked like hot dogs) and the sTruesel (too many beers to remember how it tasted).  All in all a good time and I would recomend anyone to give it a shot.",

    "text": "Hunter S. Thompson once wrote that Circus Circus is what the whole he world would be doing Saturday nights if the Nazis had won the war.   I disagree with that wise man on this issue as I not only think, but I know that if zee Germans had won zee war, we'd all be going to places like Hofbrauhaus on a Friday, Saturday and Sunday night. and you know what? I'm fine with that.  Well, I guess not the whole \"master race\" stuff, but really, more areas should have a Hofbrauhaus in their backyard as there is seriously some good times to be had in what I'm happy to say is a complete sausage fest!   You would have to be a complete dummkopf to not have a lot of fun here.   This sort of establishment, atmosphere and general wildness can really only be found during Oktoberfest in most places. So to have this go on nightly in the Vegas Hofbrauhaus.. that's something special.   Then you have Das Boot! Yes, DAS BOOT! Because really, if you even know a little bit of German, you'd realize that everything needs to be said in a very stern and loud voice or you're not speaking the language correctly. Though you don't need to speak anything but drunk here.. And Das Boot will help.   If you've seen the film Beerfest, this place has a Das Boot glass that you can chug down your booze in. Just remember to twist it at the end or you'll have a full load of beer coming at you. It is a little pricey if you're going for the glass one, but if you just want Das Boot, they have a plastic one.   As for the food.. It's DELICIOUS! Not to mention very large when it comes to portion sizes. Now I'm not that much of a sauerkraut fan, but I ate the whole damn plate of it when it was in front of me. Though, perhaps that was also to soak up some of the copious amounts of alcohol that I drank while listening to the band play.   I'm sure the house band cycles through songs every two hours. Either that or I just got really really German in my time here and felt like I knew the songs by heart. Those two semesters in PCC couldn't have taught me that much, could they?  Now they only have two beers here and two beers only. But the lack of selection  is made up by the massive amount of booze. and really, when trying to polish off a huge plate of frankfurters and kraut, who wouldn't want a good pilsener? Just don't forget your Lederhosen  For those seeking an even bigger kink, order the shots! A fraulein comes out with them on a paddle so you and a couple of friends can swing them down. Then said Frau bends you over and gives you a whack with the wooden paddle, Mit Vergnugen!!!! And who wouldn't want to get spanked with the same paddle that your shots were brought out on? Ich weiss nicht?  If visiting the Vegas area or you're a local and haven't come already, make sure you suggest it to your group, NEIN! Insist that you go at once!   OANS, ZWOA, G'SUFFA!",

We hit Joeys NYC Pizza across the street after our dinner. $6 for pizza and a drink served by Joey's appreciative employees was far better than the Hofbrauhaus.

Not a good place for kids or if you want to talk with friends. The beers are at a good selection and very plentiful. Love the giant pretzel with the three different dipping sauce. Like the cheese dip the best. Lunch time is still a bit busy, but nothing like the nighttime. Tried the Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte which is a collection of various types of delicious tasting sausages with imported sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The red cabbage is amazing. It is still a bit weird to be seated at a table with other people. So be prepared to be taken out of your comfort zone. This place is perfect for bachelor or bachelorette parties. I like to pick friends up from the airport and bring them here. The beer garden is the perfect back area to retreat to if things get really crazy in the beer hall. The worst part of the whole experience is the parking situation. Very limited parking and you are somewhat forced to valet park.",

It is a huge restaurant near the strip and near the airport. The live entertainment is great. They have a live band every night. The restaurant seats big groups and small groups and it is family friendly. There is Oktoberfest every day and whoever hasn't been there should give it a try. I am pretty sure you will come back. It is a lot of fun and a great place to party drink and eat! They have the main hall called Schwemme and even a temperature controlled indoor Biergarten (beergarden) with a fountain and trees. The Party is going on every night and esspecially Friday and Saturday night with Bar Games, Stein Holding Contests and more. The Main Hall is great for everyone especially bachelor and bachelorette parties. The Biergarten is a little bit quieter which is great and perfect for weddings, birthday parties, family dinners, holiday parties or just some nice dates or dinner conversations. They are open daily for Lunch and Dinner. You don't want to miss out on this great restaurant!",

    "text": "First off, this place is home to some serious ass-whacking.  Be prepared.  Bar Maids with wooden paddles spank the customers.  That might sound nice, but I assure you...it really isnt.  Although it IS great entertainment, and I love this place for it.  Beer: Had the Octoberfest.  Wife had Dunkel.  Both very good.  equal rating.  Had 2 liters, so I must have liked it.  15.50 per liter. Don't be scared.  Apps: Pretzel. Cheese, mustards.  Must have.  Meals: Had the wurstplatte, wife had schnitzel sandwich.  Loved mine.  Hers was good, not great.  I am the German in the family, so...  Service: Fine.  We had a large group so it is a pain t begin with.  they got to beat 3 of the group with a chunk of wood, so that probably helped them deal with it.  Games: quarter bounce into stein, stein holding (I am a champ!4.5 minutes), drinking through giant Ricolah horn, dancing, chanting, singing, etc.  And, of course, wooden paddle ass beating.  Thumbs up to all.  The guy who was on stage drank about a keg of beer while performing a variety of buffoonery.  He was great.  If you want a nice quiet meal, stay as far away from here as possible.  If you want a party atmosphere, beer drinking with some good sausage and kraut....this is the place for you.  Bring your checkbook...it ain't cheap.",

The service is pretty good, but is overshadowed by the bland food.",

The food tasted good but expensive ($21.57) for a typical size meal. The place had a live band and the diners were dancing and having fun. You have to be in the mood for the lively entertainment atmosphere and beer drinking to enjoy this place.",

So we did.  We went to the house.  Boy - am I glad that we did.  It was such a treat.  We really enjoyed every bit.  The live band.  The spankings.  Oh yes - you read that right.  The SPANKINGS.  Old men, young men, women and children.  Waitresses come around with their paddle and a shot.  I'm guessing shots are optional for the wee ones.  It's as heavy as a buuf fat though.  Man.  I ordered a chicken sandwich and hubby got sausages and mashed potatoes.  Very large portions.  The appetizer pretzel we got was HUGE!  But oh so good.  We stood on tables and drank German beer.  It was such a good time.  We had a blast with just the two of us.  I can imagine the fun to be had by a large group.  Grab a good mood and run by this place for a GREAT mood!!!",

There was so much going on, singing, activities, beer holding, butt spanking by the hot waitresses.... LOL! By the time we were leaving, the people that were sitting where the stage was all stood on their tables and benches - DANCING and SINGING!

The only compliant that I had about the food is it was delivered very fast (10-15 minutes after we ordered it).  In addition, the servers seemed to be in a bit of hurry (running around a lot).  However, the noise level in the main dining room was deafening.  I was expecting it to be loud, but not rock concert/club level loud.  After 5 minutes, I asked my server if we could move to the beer garden.  She was very polite, and allowed us to move there.  I could still hear the live music, but it least it was at a reasonable volume.  So, if you are either drunk, crazy, or hard of hearing (or a combination thereof), you'll enjoy the main room.  However, if you don't fit into any of those categories, then you will find the beer garden to have a much better environment.  If you don't like to hear lively music at dinner, don't go to Hofbrauhaus.",

The clothes on the women weren't too shabby, hehe, but the food wasn't good. We ordered the special of the day- the goulash. It was AWFUL. It was just a bunch of meat slapped together with god knows what, then under, some sauerkraut. Now, I love all these ingredients-but how is this a goulash? The flavors (not that there were any...) just collided with each other, and overall it didn't work together. Plus it's very expensive for what they serve, and I had 2 small cups of diet coke (which they didn't bother to fill even the whole way) which they charge $3 for each! How ridiculous! The only reason I'm giving this 3 stars instead of 2 is because of the great dessert. Although skeptical, I ordered the special which was a strawberry rhubarb strudel which was pretty good-taste and texture...I'd give that a 5 stars :)  Hope this review helped!",

They accommodate large groups and singles easily. The pretzel platter with all the dips is a great appetizer, and I loved the potato soup. yuuuuuuum.  oh yeah, and they have a full bar for those who need something a little stronger.  Where else can you grab a stein, stand on the table, and sing?   The best part is that it's like getting a really cheesy show for free. Totally Vegas.

(the hotel lobby when you first get into vegas, disneyland, and a brothel are things that come close).  total authentic german beer hall, or so i was old by friend's german wife seeing that i've never been to germany, but again i digress.  there's long wood benches where you pretty much sit down close to the other dining guests.  but everyone is super friendly and the place is pretty lively at all hours.  everyone is just drinking, singing, cheering with each other, and having a great time.  the waitresses are the coolest and apparently will lay the smack down with the paddle they keep handy.  they fly in their hef straight from germany and it comes in it is served in giant beer steins, just the holy grail of goodness.  best hef ever.  the taste is just phenomenal and the dangerous part is that it goes down like bud light.  the food is awesome.  got to get the giant pretzel to go along with your hef.  had the ribeye last time and it was just fantastic.  the one minor drawback is that for a beer hall its kinda pricey.  we always end up with a bill of more than $50 a person, but i think that's mostly because the steins of hef run about $15.  but its well worth the money.  bottom line is that you definitely need to come here when you're in vegas.  its right across from the hard rock which is another place you should be visiting so here's your chance to kill two birds with one stone.  cheers.",

The only difference I noticed is that the original has breathalizer machines in the restrooms, whereas they are conspicuously absent here in Vegas.  :)  You'll just have to guesstimate how drunk you get.  One comes to Hofbrauhaus for the beer, and it certainly does not disappoint.  My favorite is the dark beer, but the wheat beer is the real star:  If you have ever consumed some half-assed American knock off at a wheat beer, you'll see why the brewery even tried!  (I.E. The German stuff is goooooood!!!!).  I've had a few food items here, and they were good.  I woudl highly recommend the 1/2 chicken with potato salad.    When this place is rocking, the atmosphere is the best.  The table setup and beer hall format really liven the place up.  You are likely to be seated next to folks you don't know, so half the fun is making friends while drinking copious amounts of beer.  The bar area up front is a bit more chill, and you can even watch the game on the 3 plasmas.  They also have a back dining area that is more suitable to families (it is away from the Polka band and not filled with drunken idiots like me).",

The big downfall of this place is the ridiculous almost crazy prices. The prices here are not just a bit over, they are NUTS. Absolutely downright madness...even in a city where things are expensive. (I don't recall the Hofbrauhaus outside of Cincy being this bloated in price.) 19$ for a plate of fried fish (and gross, super cheap Tilapia on top of that), 16$ for a couple chicken sausages...The beer is also pricey but not as off as the food. 13.99 for a pretzel and some side fixings. Yes it was a giant pretzel, but that is ridonkulous that it's so ridiculous. I'd say come here for a beer, share a pretzel or an entree and scoot if you REALLY want to come here. Otherwise you will spend a boatload on very simply flavored food!!",

What a stupid idea it is in this day of decreasing digital privacy to ask people for their e-mail address just to eat at a restaurant.  I came in with a coupon for a free 10 ounce beer with a lunch or dinner entree that I received from one of the tourist booths.  I ordered a Mini HB Smokehaus Platter.  The waitress came back and said they couldn't honor my coupon because I ordered a \"lunch special\" or some bullshit like that.  So I left and will never return.  What a bunch of freaking cheapskates these morons are.  A small 10 ounce draft [smaller than a can of soda] maybe costs them a dollar.  By not honoring THEIR OWN COUPON they get: 1.  A lost sale 2.  A lost customer who will never go to a Hoffbrau Haus again. 3.  A lost customer who will badmouth Hoffbrau Haus to anyone who will listen. 4.  A lost customer who will convince others to never to the Hoffbrau Haus.  Good job, Hofbrauhaus!",

My husband had one of the sausage dishes and said it and the sauerkraut were delicious. We also made room for dessert and weren't disappointed... Black Forest cake melted in my mouth and the cheesecake was perfect. In addition to great food, there was great entertainment-music and the \"shot lady\" who spanked you with her paddle if you ordered a shot of Jager (neither of us did that). This isn't the place to go if you want a quiet dinner, but if you want good food and loud entertainment, you should go.",

I was pleased by their knowledge of alternative diets and menu offerings, but maybe German food doesn't impress me personally. I did enjoy the kraut, but maybe not for $5. Service was slow although it was not crowded. We asked to change the TV twice, but it never happened and was not addressed by the staff.",

Afraid we wouldn't make it there was no chance of that happening if we could walk over from the Hard Rock. I have been coming here for many years as I have had many a business trip to Las Vegas.   Well this visit did not disappoint in fact my husband and friends are now big fans as well. Came here on a Friday night, a week before Christmas. The place was packed and in a very festive mood. We were seated near the band up front as well as next to a table of frat boys. Our waitress was fantastic and immediately took our orders for drinks. A huge glass stein of beer please. Than we shared a nice warm pretzel. It was perfect and hit the spot with the beer. For my main course wiener schnitzel with a side of German potato salad. My husband had a different variation with gravy and our friends the chicken. The food is heavenly exactly like it is in Germany except there I would get skinny French Fries. I prefer it with the Potato Salad as it is here it compliments the dish. For such a large portion it disappeared from my plate quickly.   The music was terrific at times the band would play we all got up and danced. The table of frat boys danced as well. Than they would get shots of Jaiggermister and get spanked. My husband told me while we danced that this was his best Birthday ever. We bought framed photos that they took of our table as well as a glass stein and our friend I saw him the next day in a bright orange Hofbrau Haus t shirt. New fans for life.",

    "text": "I'm not gonna lie. This place is bomb ass phenomenal. I can't speak for its authenticity though because I really don't have a point of reference when it comes to German music and German food. Regardless, what sets this place apart from the other restaurant joints on the Las Vegas Strip is the sheer fact that there's booze (really tasty booze), jumbo hot dogs, singing, dancing, yelling, screaming, shots, and last but not least, spanking. Yes. SPANKING.   It's a rather unique atmosphere. Not exactly a bar, not exactly a full-on restaurant, and not exactly a dance floor, karaoke, and/or concert stage spot. It's really a mix of all of these on top of being family friendly, oddly enough.   The other great thing about this place is that the beer mugs that they pour your beer into are ginormous. Way, way bigger than your typical bar mug. It's a Viking-sized glass mug. Heavy. Easily a 32 oz mug, if I had to say so.   Truth be told, I can't remember what I ordered but I remember it being a hot dog. Like a giant-sized hot dog in a giant-sized hot dog bun. I think it came with a side of fries. I remember liking the hot dog a lot. Tasted like fresh pork. For what it was, it was actually filling. No complaints here. And I ordered the Dunkel beer and the Dunkel Weizen. Pretty solid. The first one tasted like a spicy dark beer, which was strange but tasty. The second one is basically a darker version of a typical hefe weizen. Pretty good, I'd say.   I think the highlight of this spot is the lady with the wooden paddle who does the spanking. Best entertainment out of all that is going on in this joint. Men would literally line up, pay the chick for a shot of liquor, and get positioned for a spanking. It's totally bizarre but entertaining at the same time.   The only real downside about the spot is the prices. It's not cheap. But it's not going to break your wallet, if you're accustomed to paying $15-25 a dish per meal. I think the dinner meals are more expensive than this and the prices that we saw were probably for the lunch menu. But the quality is there so I won't ding them a star on that. (It'd be a whole other story if they charge these high-ish prices but the quality of food and drinks aren't there. How can you tell? Well, later that night, I took a huge ass deuce and my poop was solid, smooth, and it came out easily. DEAL WITH THAT IMAGERY!!!!)  All in all, this is a really cool spot to bring a large group of friends and family with you to enjoy. So far as entertainment and things that you can do here, there's definitely something for everyone: men and women. I totally recommend this spot and would definitely come back to this place, if I happen to be visiting Las Vegas again with a group of friends.",

I've bought many a paddling for friend and foe and years ago it was the workers and the servants who looked German and added to experience that did the paddling.  Ever since they moved to the Vegas chick in black who hisses like a cat and sells shots like a Fremont street natural, it's lost the edge and sullies the experience.  I've personally got Heidi and others who look the part and bad ass to do the paddling instead.  It was worth the extra tip to see the look on my boys faces when a women who can carry 8 steins is about to bring down the wrath of the beer garden gods upon their boney white asses.

What we didn't know is that we could have sat in the Bier Garten area which is a much more pleasant atmosphere where you can actually hear and have a conversation.  If we were still in our 20's, the festive area would have been fine. We just wish that the hostesses offered us the option when seating us. The noise makes it impossible for some of us to hear.  We asked our server if we could sit in the Bier Garten and she was very helpful in helping us relocate all of our items. Our server, Julie Anne I think was her name, was great and the only reason for the two stars. Otherwise, there would have been zero stars if given the choice.  Julie Anne provided us with just the perfect amount of attentiveness. She was helpful, nice and pleasant.  The German beer was good but the food was awful!  On my previous visit I had good schnitzel, this time was an entirely different story. Three out of the four of us ended up sick over night. My girlfriend would have most likely been sick too but she didn't make it past the first bite of her pork sausage dinner.  We all had different entrees and we all had basically the same comment. The food tasted like it was cooked or fried in OLD deep fryer oil or grease. My girlfriend only at her mashed potatoes, the rest of us ate a good portion of our entrees and later we were all in misery.  Unfortunately that will be our last trip to the Hofbrauhaus.",

    "text": "This place has been on my list to visit for a few years now and I finally made it over... I wish I had explored it sooner.  It's been too long for me to remember the real Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany for comparison, but I sure felt like I was in a German beer hall.  The restaurant is divided into two dining areas.  The first is an open Beer Hall with large tables.  Perfect for larger groups.  Six of us were at a table with plenty of room to spare.  The second area is a Beer Garden which has smaller tables and more for a quiet(er) meal.   There's also a bar at the front of the building.  The Beer Garden seemed to be closed for a party when I was there.  There's a band playing upbeat German style music. As other reviews mentioned, there's barmaids walking around with shots and will give you a paddling you haven't felt since you were in Junior High!  (Well, for those of us old enough to have been spanked before the world became soft and sensitive.)  This place was hopin' on a Tuesday night.  No... I didn't get paddled.  The food was definitely close to being authentic German dishes.  It may not be something everybody can appreciate (like how some people can't stand Chinese, sushi or Mexican), but the flavor and quality was good.  The food ranges from snacks/appetizers perfect for simply wanting to have a night of drinking.  There is a variety of dishes if you want a meal.   I was happy with what I ate.    Now to the beer.... this is a GERMAN BEER HALL.  Go away if you're looking for Miller,  Coors or some fru-fru status symbol.  They only have German style beer here.  The selection is limited to several different beers, and they were all good.    If you're looking for a quiet, dull time where you can enjoy meaningful conversation and eat Americanized versions of another culture's food, then go someplace else.  If you're looking for a place with higher energy to have fun and experience something different, then this is a good place to try.  Hofbrauhaus is on my short list of must-visit places whenever I return to Vegas.",

My only tip is to bring a German friend with you, (or someone familiar with German food) so that they can help you choose between the different schnitzels and make sure you're not dipping your pretzel into the wrong mustard or something. Also beware, if you're a guy, there's a good chance you may be called up on stage to participate in an impromptu stein holding competition. Google Masskrugstemmen and start training those arm muscles.",

Rumor has it that their beer is brewed using original recipes and is imported directly from the brewery in Munich, Germany. The live music was good, they made it real fun and I like that the band interacts with the audience. Tip the band and you get to run around ringing their cow bell,order a shot from a Jager girl and get a paddled. I didn't have enough liquid courage to do this and my shorts were to thin, to get paddled. However, it was a blast watching other people get paddled. Our party of 4 shared a Jumbo Complete (Giant pretzel pretzel served with \"Obazter\" cheese, sweet mustard, and onion mustard and one of my friend's and I shared a Schnitzel Sandwich - Breaded Chicken Breast Fried Golden Brown served on a Kaiser Roll., it was delish! I liked the ambiance, it was loud in here but that's what was fun about it. Knowing me, I'm the loudest person in our table, I like to yell and cheer A LOT.

Having visited the original in Munich many years ago, I was admittedly a tad skeptical, but more than willing to try it...and am I glad that I did!  The ambiance is loud, lively, and very fun, especially with the Oompah band is playing.  There was A LOT of beer and Jagermeister going around this evening I can tell you!  After ordering our beers, I had a dark dunkel, we kicked back and watched the show that surrounded us, both visually and audibly.  Wonderful German festival songs permeated the air, as fellow diners (and us) swung our beers side to side, singing and chanting together.  We thoroughly enjoyed watching those ordering a Jagermeister shot (I think) that was served on a long wooden plank...which was subsequently used to spank the diner on the butt by the waitress!  We ordered a large pretzyl to share, which came with two types of mustards for dipping; it was delicious!  For my entree, I ordered the sauerbraten.  I admit, I was not expecting it to be great...but it was!  Served with spatzle covered in gravy and picked beets (on the side), the pork entree was smothered in its reduced wine sauce and so, so good!  I'll be honest, I was so enamored with my meal, I forget what my mom and friend ordered.  Regardless, I recall them liking their meals very much as well.    Overall, the Hofbrauhaus is a fun, festive place offering surprisingly good food and great ambiance.",

The \"outdoor\" (standard LV sky painted ceiling) has a working fountain and balcony, which look nice.  A great overflow/quiet room to escape any nuttiness in the main room.  And let's be clear, this is Vegas (and America), so it's super fake and non-authentic (think Venetian), but it tries, the beer is awesome, and the food is good enough, so I'd be back.  If you think you'll be transported to Munich, take another look at the map and come back to Earth.  Went on a Saturday afternoon with the wife and the daytime solo act was one of the best one-man shows I've seen in a while.  Funny, musical, interactive.  Oh, and toasts drinking often, in case you needed a reason.  Folks are looking to have fun and talk with each other (i.e., not a normal American bar), so that's a huge plus.  I'll be back here again on a weekend night to try it out--yeah, it's that worth it.  As for the food, the schnitzel isn't breaded (?!) and they charge for extra Jaeger sauce, which is stupid, but the spaetzle isn't bad and the Wien Wuerstl (Vienna sausage) is spot-on (with that special German snap).  The black forest cake is horrid, more like a Devil's food cake with a couple cherries, so avoid that at all costs.",

Friends and I ordered them and 5 minutes later we get slips of paper saying \"we acknowledge beer is sold separately.\" Looked at the menu, and sure enough the dumb plastic boots are 20 bucks.  Definitely did not see that on the menu, nor was I interested in squeezing a plastic boot in my carry on. I told the waiter we did not want the boot, we had made the mistake, we were very sorry, but we wanted our beer poured into glass steins that we did not have to buy.  FIRST, I fully acknowledge the mistake was mine. What I don't agree with OR appreciate was what the manager did afterwards.   He came over, and anticipating an apology for the confusion, instead got a guilt trip from the fact that they can't reuse the 2 boots he had poured and had to \"eat the cost.\" THEY'RE MADE IN CHINA! How much can they cost? 5 cents each? He even awkwardly paused like I was going to jump in and offer to pay for them.  Haven't been a restaurant manager before, but I don't think \"make the customer feel guilty in hopes they pay for wasted product\" is part of the restaurant manual.",

This was the first time I had ever had a dish of red cabbage that had cinnamon in it. I didn't like it and it isn't in any of the traditional recipes I have but everything else tasted fine. The sausages are extremely skinny. If you get the 3 pork sausage plate, their smaller sausages basically add up to one regular sized one.

We had no reservations, but within one hour, we were able to make a reservation via open table, and get seated. I was impressed because there were 10 of us and it was a Saturday night. As soon as we get there I was overwhelmed with the   The ENVIRONMENT is huge! They have a live band at the very front and the decor is great. Very German/Oktoberfestish. All seating is on wooden picnic bench style seats.  One thing to keep in mind is the noise. It's really loud when a band is playing.  So loud that we had to pretty much yell at each other to have a conversation. However, just because it's loud, it doesn't mean you can fart at will. You have to remember that its picnic bench style seating and your friends will still feel the vibration.    The FOOD here was satisfactory IMO. I asked our server for his recommendation and he suggested the Jagerschnitzel. It's a pork cutlet with bacon and onions covered in mushroom sauce. Plate also comes with cranberries and Spatzle which is a German noodle. The Spatzle taste like macaroni. The pork was a little gristly for me but the overall blend of everything on the plate was pretty good.    The BEER tasted great and was so refreshing. Since we were there in October the seasonal beer was the famous Oktoberfest. All their beers are brewed and imported from Munich Germany. We all ordered our beers in that huge beer mug that you can serve rootbeer floats in. It was so good that I wanted another but the night was young and that one mug already had me feelin pretty good.    SPANKING SERVICE - While we were waiting for our food this lady AKA The Jager Girl came to our table and asked us if we wanted a Jager shot. She didn't say how much and we didn't care to ask at the time because we wanted one of our friends who never drinks and is really shy to get loose. So a few of us bought shots for him. We didn't realize that you get spanked for every shot you take. He took it well and we later found out that each shot was only 5 dollars. So then we all decided to get one.   The actual SERVICE of the restaurant was pretty good as well. They checked on us quite a bit and our food was brought out in a timely manner.   Overall, it was a great experience. Solid 4 stars for me.",

I visited on a Saturday evening and had the Schweinebraten.  It was an average pork roast with dark gravy, very few vegetables to garnish it, with a side of potato and dumpling.  You could have had it at any family diner in the Midwest.  In the end, hofbrauhaus is sort of like an epcot center execution of a german restaurant.  One final observation: the communal seating works great if you go there with a group, but if you go by yourself (or with a date as the poor soul seated next to me discovered) you are sort of hung out to dry.  You would be better off at a local pub.",

Having lived in Germany for several years and visiting more brauhauses and gasthauses than I can remember, I can say they do a fairly good job of bringing German atmosphere and cuisine to America (it was a little dead when we went, but it was about 4 pm on a Wednesday, so....).  The currywurst was spot-on, and you can't really go wrong with a giant pretzel with cheese!  The schnitzel was pretty good (although I make better--sorry guys!) and was quite a large portion.  Our only major complaint was that my husband ordered a dunkel and got a heffe, but whatever, he drank it anyway.  It would be nice if they had a kids' menu, although I understand that families aren't really their target audience (if I remember correctly, the real one in Munich doesn't have a kids' menu either).

They are located throughout the world and all look / feel the same. The highlights:  - Amazing food. Lot's of traditional German / Bavarian dishes - Good German beer - Great service - Like real German beer halls, you sit at long tables with other visitors. You make a lot of new friends from around the world - Cool German bands - Fantastic apple strudel  - They sell fresh roasted beer nuts - so good..... - Great party atmosphere, I stumble out of here regularly  If you buy shots, Blond women in tight clothing will spank you HARD with a wooden paddle. Not sure I get this part but someone gets it every few minutes.   Highly recommended.",

She did not exaggerate.  It's not quite $14 worth of hamburger (I have had that, and this aint it), but it is a very high quality hamburger at a very generous size.  Factor the extra you're paying toward the experience as you watch drunken idiots get spanked by a wooden paddle (not kidding).",

We had to wait for two hours when they said the the wait was only an hour which we understood since we didn't make reservations. That wasn't the messed up part though. When we finally got in they told us we would have a bench to ourselves. Not only did we not have one, they had us sit with another group in a confined area where they added another makeshift table in the middle of the aisle where not only could we not get out of but also created a safety hazard. The waitresses couldn't even get through! When the manager ( I believe her name was Mona) was told about this she said the waitress would find a way around it. They told us we would have to wait again if we didn't like it. Yeah so they could do that to us again no thanks. Now they just want your money and will stuff as many as they can in just to make a buck.",

    "text": "Real German Food!  I live in Sacramento, CA and usually come to Vegas for about a week once every year while attending the CES convention.  There are a lot of places I have to make sure I visit to eat and this is one of them.  Looking around, we don't really have German restaurants in Sacramento. I mean there are restaurants in Sacramento that are categorized as German, but they are German themed food with your meats and potatoes and such.  This place has actual authentic German dishes which is what I look forward too and what Sacramento sorely needs.  When you first walk into here, you walk into their small merchandise room where you can find an assortment of German themed items and clothing, some of them of course with Hofbrauhaus's name into it. Beyond there are two rooms, Not sure the name of the first room but walking through that room, you arrive to the beer garden portion of the room.  The first room is slightly dark lit, and as we've always come there for dinner, they always have a band playing there. It's a very loud room.  I prefer to eat in the beer garden where I can't hear most of the music. For those looking for a happy go lucky fun time with eating, drinking and singing, that first room is for you. When the hostess asked if I wanted to be seated close or far from the music, she took us and was proceeding to have us sit in the first room, but further from the band.  I had to tell her that we actually meant the beer garden. So it looks like you have to specify that in the beginning.  Most of the patrons are in the first room and the beer garden is more empty although is slowly fills up as well.  We ordered and had our drinks shortly.  The food came out surprisingly fast and bow was the food good.  I did notice that teh waitresses weren't that busy, even when more people started to file into the beer garden.  They spent a lot of time talking with one another. Not sure if this is a good or bad thing but they did it a ways away from us so whenever I needed something, they were right there. Very attentive? Too attentive?  It didn't bother me too much.    Also, I think their root beer might be house made.  Drinking it, I really couldn't distinguish between what type of root beer it was but it was pleasantly sweet.  If you love German food or haven't tried German food before, you have to hit this place up.",

My friends and I found ourselves here after we noticed that the British pub Firkin on Paradise was no longer in business. We figured we could at least grab some cold German beers and comfort food here, and that's what we got. They have all your wursts and schnitzels here; I got the schnitzel that wasn't all breaded and fried, and I thought it was pretty good, but like most other items on the menu a bit overpriced. I'd been here once before just to grab a cold brew and it's surprising that they don't have a lot of different beers here; there's only a few varieties, if memory serves. I just went with a lager, which was a refreshing accompaniment to my hearty meal. We were kept entertained during the meal by the one-man band playing his heart out on the stage. Not only did he keep the music going, he got the audience to participate in a stein-holding contest, which was pretty damn impressive, I must say! Our waitress was friendly but a bit lax when it came to checking on us, even though it wasn't super-busy at the time. Overall, a solid OK if you're in the mood for this kind of thing!",

The Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas does a very good job of capturing the beer hall experience. They serve traditional HB beers in liters and half liters plus my favorite (and one of the best) Hefeweizen's- Franziskaner!     Come to HB to enjoy a great time with friends and family. It gets quite loud, but that's due to the fact it's a big party. You do have the option of drinking and dining in the large Biergarten room in the back which is much quieter.    The food is not gourmet German fare but its very good and what you should expect from a beer hall. They have a great selection of wurst's and schnitzel's (sausages and veal). Their pretzels are terrific, the pate and cheese spreads are delicious!     I bring my entire family here (4 kids) and we always have a great time. The kids love the singing, the dancing, and especially the paddling!....haha  Just go check it out, it's a lot of fun!",

I tried their special which was German roast pork with a nice crust to it, served with a beer gravy on top of a bed of creamy mashed potatoes with a side of hot pickled cabbage slaw with bits of bacon in it, which was a nice change from the usual  red cabbage slaw.  The food was large in portion and very filling.  The service was the downfall as we sat waiting for our server for 20 minutes before someone stepped in and realized they never showed up.  The manager made up for it by comping our pretzel and apologizing and our server who took over did a great job.",

Started off with a huge pretzel served with a spicy mustard, an onion mustard and a cheese spread.  Then moved on to some tasty German sausages.

But let's get to the reason I love it!!!  First of all, it's actually built like a Hofbrauhaus.  Tall, rounded ceilings, a long hall full of picnic style tables where you sit with strangers, and a LIVE German Oompa band!!  Yay!!  It's like German Disneyland, with music, dancing (normally the chicken dance or some sort of chain style of dancing).  Most times I've been there I've run into Europeans- Germans, Austrians, Swiss- and they know all the songs and sing along!  I've even seen a few dance on the tables.  It is not unusual for diners to dance and participate in the entertainment (though it is not required!)  The bands change every few weeks or monthly, so every time I go it's a new experience.  Some of the bands specialize in things or have different 'activities' such as playing the long alpenhorn, dancing the chickendance in a chicken mask, or one time a band member had people throw coins into his tuba!   If you want to eat, the pretzels are okay, and so is the cheese dip.  I also eat the potato soup on a regular basis and it's fine.   The salads are okay.  I was not impressed by the schnitzels I've had there.  The sausages were ok, but they're hard to mess up.  Of course they have German Beer, and a sad selection of wine (I know they have Riesling, but no Gewurtz).  And they have Schnapps paddles.  One good natured waitress posed pretending to spank my boss with the schnapps paddle!  The waitresses are normally not German, but it's Vegas, so just go have a drink and have some fun!",

The potato ball I had was definitely mostly Farina.   Texture and taste were all wrong.  Grew up in a German household and kartoffoclasse were made from scratch by hand from a generations old recipe.   However, I'm pleased to report that the spaetzle were properly NOT overcooked, which is a common problem with most restaurant spaetzle.   These were a bit doughy/chewy, comparable to al dente pasta.  (I tasted my boy friend's.)  The Jager schnitzel was also quite good.  (tasted a friend's.)",

    "text": "End of September is the start of Oktoberfest and it is only right to stop by Las Vegas' most popular Bavarian eatery. The large communal dining area are filled with tables and benches. Unless you come with a large party, there is a chance that you will sit next to random strangers. This style of dining has seriously caught my interest as of late because I am always interested in other patrons thought on menu items.   The waitresses are all dressed up in country style outfits. Looking around, they reminded me of a more natural attractive look than places on the strip. Our waitress was pushy in a playful way and quick to guide us to some of their most popular dishes.   The beers and food are on the pricey side. They highly rely on their touristy appeal. With the prices comes a relatively large portion as well. We started with two half liters of the Oktoberfest beer and their signature soft pretzel with a sweet mustard, spicy mustard, and a cheese spread made from cream cheese and brie. This was magnificent. At first, I was hesitant because the size of our neighbors pretzel was huge. I did not want to load up on unnecessary carbs, but once it hit our table, it stood no chance.   Once the doughy treat was devoured, we ordered the three pork sausages served with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes. The warm pickled cabbage was good, but the mash had very little flavor besides cream. The pork sausages were mild and tender.   I am normally not a fan of this cuisine because it is on the heavy side. Splitting an appetizer and an entree was enough for two of us. There was no real big complaints about the experience, but it was just ok.",

    "text": "The Hofbrauhaus was a lot of fun for me and my parents (my mom's family is from Bavaria, so this is a bit of home cooking for her! What better place to take them?).  As soon as we walked in, we sat at a huge wooden table and ordered some beers. They were delicious (and huge). A bunch of cute German guys were enjoying some beers and brats in their lederhosen, and eventually, they were subjected to shots and spankings (thanks to one of their friends). Maybe a little too entertaining, but it was a fun time. A three-piece band played Bavarian standards and many of the patrons sang along/danced. A very fun time.  As for the food, the portions are generous and the flavors are savory and delicious. I had one of my favorites, currywurst. The pretzels are really soft and chewy--perfect with a beer. The prices are moderate, but if you're not starving, I'd say split it with a friend. There's too much to eat, and you can always order more if you're hungry. This was, hands-down, my parent's favorite place we visited in Vegas. We'll be back next time.",

The atmosphere is frenetic between the live music, beer stein holding contests, and the guys with the jagermeister shots getting paddled.  That was probably the most amusing part of the whole evening-- watching a large-boned beer wench (can I say that?!) paddling middle age men on the butt after they did a shot of jagermeister.  And they enjoyed it..... !  For me, I'm not a beer drinker, nor do I like the standard \"pig and potatoes\" german diet.  So eating my salad and drinking my glass of wine just didn't cut it in the biergarten.  It's a great place to take your friends, (girls) share a stein of beer, and try a fresh pretzel.  Let your hair down. But go eat somewhere else.",

Coming from a real German lover, this food does not resemble it by far. Its so salty, portions are small and bratwurst is awful. Waitresses should be as hot as in public posters that are all over the city, that would make the place so much better haha. But in fact they are old, out of shape and grumpy. We were really looking for a young busty blonde as in posters :P well atleast something close to it, not a grumpy grandmother. Also they kicked us out pretty early when it was close to closing time, no time to even finish our beer... Save your money and go to Germany in the future, you will not regret it.",

None of us knew what was coming next, and boy was it a magnificent joyful pleasure. The sheer terror on our friend's face as he was asked to clench his fists, lock his knees and spread his legs. She even asked him to move to the vacant table beside us, as she could not get a good swing in as there was a pillar blocking her at our table.

Appears to be a bit campy (like a lot of the Vegas experience, I guess), but hey, great beer and hot looking wenches, I mean, waitresses. Come with an open mind, a commitment to a good time, and lots of friends and you'll be fine.  We started with the Jumbo Complete, which is a huge pretzel served with 3 dipping sauces: Obatzer cheese, sweet mustard, and onion mustard and the Hofbrauhaus Brotzeittler, the cold cut meat plate that comes with pork, ham, sausages, cheese, pickles, and rye bread. Goes well with any of the beers, my choice (first of 3) was the Dunkel, the dark beer which was smooth and rich.  For our group (3 couples) we also split the: - Hofbrauhaus Platte: smoked pork loin, pork roast, and a delicious smoked sausage served with dark beer sauce, mashed potato, and sauerkraut. A huge plate for 2 but we were able to rise to the task. -Hofbrauhause Wurstplatte: Frankfurters, pork and chicken sausages also served with mashed potatos and sauerkraut. -Muchner Weisswurst, the veal and pork sausages, absolutely delicious! good with the heffe (maybe another litre??)  Do a shot of alcohol and your server with spank you as a reward. I can only wonder what you get for finishing DAS BOOT, a giant boot of lager. I also had the lager, which had a nice bite to it.  You can end your visit with a trip to the lobby gift shop for lederhosen, tshirts, or a six-pack of beers for the hotel room after party. Will definitely fill you up, looking forward to going back for more (and I don't just mean more spanks). The place fills up on weekends, so definitely call in for a reservation.",

It also had condiments for a hamburger rather than a hot dog or \"brat\" which made absolutely no sense. Who just wants a toasted bun and extra long breakfast sausage? Not me! I also had their Bavarian potato soup and it looked good but really it lacked flavor and the supposed sliced sausage in it was more like sliced ballpark franks. What's sad is I could have had a better loaded sausage at Wienerschnitzel.",

    "text": "Tikka Takke Tikka Takke Oi Oi Oi!  It's a Bavarian German mess hall with bench seating and bosomed bar maids and boots of booze!  My favorite imported brews are served in giant glass steins with strong heft to them.  Dunkel brau ist mein favorite.  Strangely enough I find a connection with my 3rd generation removed Germanic bloodline to be very intoxicating at Hofbrau.  Decorated in faux old fatherland fixings.  The atmosphere is most inviting and exiting as you are transported to the old castle days reminiscent of lederhosen and clogs.  Think St. Pauli girl in practice.  Various Germanic accents abound they really have a knack for the \"Vegas recreation\" feel here.  The traditional brats wieners and Vienna sausages on order are accompanied quite stoutly with the beers on tap and the pretzels and bitter sides with sauerkraut are an attestment to the dedication to the stout beer this culture has dedicated itself to throughout history.  In other words everything on the menu tastes much better with a glug of beer.  Seriously not knocking the taste of the food in general, but much like most European countries the cuisine is somewhat mated to the alcoholic beverage of favor.  You seriously can't fully appreciate the food with out the drink.  Sour goes great with stout.   The entertainment is live and seemingly imported as well.  Lively stereotypical lederhosen wearing front man singing and commanding communal cheers throughout the meal.  It is a good idea to keep the large steins filled.  Raise a glass.  Shout an old world cheer.  Take a big drink and slam the glass on the table.  What medieval fun.  Sure to find yourself tipsy you may be ordered a Jeager paddle with assorted shots from which you will be challenged to gullet down in concession and afterwards the bar maids will give you one Hell of a brutal paddling for being a bad boy!  Old drinking game contests may be held from the band and you can possibly get a glass stein for winning.  Major fun can be had at the Hofbruahaus!  Make sure to stagger into the gift shop afterwards and check out the great trinkets mugs and grab a six pack of the great beer for your hangover in the morning.  Prost!",

There is no refill on my iced tea. Come back and check on us only 1 time. Again we wait for 20 min after somebody took our plates to order dessert. So when she bring our dessert , we ask for our check. Again still no refill for my iced tea. Also no refill for the guy that sit the same table with us. She always disappear from her section.

Regarding lunch we met up with 4 other business colleagues during lunch because one of the guys was there earlier in the week and he really enjoyed his lunch. So there we were table of 6. We had a free beer coupon from the Embassy Suites so we enjoyed one smaller than normal size beer. The other 5 guys enjoyed there lunch, but, I was not so impressed although our table server was very accommodating to our table needs and menu changes. The restaurant looks like an indoor beer garden, but, was very tame and appropriate for a business lunch.  In the evening a different group of 6 of us returned from American Shooters in the late evening and decided we would have dinner here. At this point there was live music and the place was hopping with people even dancing on their tables to the music.  We all used our free beer coupons for another small stein of beer. As we were eating our food we noticed one of the customers get up from his table and get paddle spanked by a waitress. I guess the guy did not pay his bill, but, actually others from the same table were also spanked minutes latter.  We quickly realized this was a ritual, which emanated years ago from customers who ordered after dinner shots. You got paddle spanked and then had to drink your shot.   After we finished our dinners the one female at our table had ordered shots for the 5 of us. Needless to say all the men got spanked except for one, who refused to participate. But we could not suffer alone so we ordered another shot for our female friend. But she had rhine stones on her jeans so the waitress was very easy on her. The guys were disappointed by the uneven hand of our waitress. The guys were hit hard, but, our female friend got off easy.  As for my dinner there was way too much food to eat and again I was not so impressed by the quality or taste of the food. I guess I don't like German food so much even though I am Polish? Maybe it is because they invaded us in the big one: WWII.   I should add service during dinner was as equally good (or better considering the circumstances) as was during lunch although we did not have any special food requests.  I would still recommend this place not so much for the food, but, because of the live music and the paddle spanking for fun. By the way I recommend the dark draft Dunkel, which was pretty tasty.",

Yes, Hofbrauhaus can be a bit touristy at times.  These are all the reasons you should avoid coming to the Hofbrauhaus.  The problem is that it is far too much fun...especially with a group of friends!...so I'll come back and and overpay for beer, overpay for food and somehow have an incredible evening non-the-less...again and again!  If you are coming here for anything other than a great amount of fun, you are going to the wrong place.  The Hofbrauhaus is a loud, German/Bavarian beer hall.  There is a live band playing all your favorite, classic, German beer drinking songs...errr...I guess I assume they are the classics and favorites... either way, they are fun reasons to heave a hefty stein or glass boot into the air and drink beer.  The beers they do are done well, especially the dunkle.  The food is fine, but nothing incredible.  I love going to the Hofbrauhaus for friends birthdays or other celebrations.  You can order a spanking from the bar-maid...it even comes with a free shot!",

    "text": "I've been spoiled on stateside Hofbrauhauses after having been to the original in Munich.   It's debatable whether it's fair to, for example, review a Vegas BBQ joint poorly \"because there's better BBQ in Memphis\" or something like that. We've all read those reviews, and I get it, but I still think that it's lousy practice to review something on what it could be, rather than what it is.   Hofbrauhaus is a little different. Its explicit goal is to exactly replicate the Hofbrauhaus Munich in every way (even down to the fake bier garten and design of the building). Quote from website: \"As an exact replica of the legendary Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany, we take great pride in giving you an experience as authentic and unforgettable as the 400-year-old original\"   OK Hofbrau, you have set the bar high - so I will evaluate accordingly.   1. Ambiance: 3/5... decent job of creating the German bierhaus feel, but the fake patio doesn't do it for me, and the super high ceilings make it feel like a cafeteria. Not Hofbrauhaus-y. Nice band though, especially if you like \"roll out the barrel\" and \"the chicken dance\"... a lot.    2. Service: 4/5.... friendly and quick service, but the ladies can't hold as many steins as those German frauleins can. Also they don't have pretzel girls walking around. Bummer.   3. Food: 3/5... it's hard to screw German food up. And they don't. But let's be real... no one comes here for the food.   4. Beer: 4/5.... all imported from the Germany Hofbrauhaus. But the authenticity points gained here are offset but those you lose from actually making it in house.    5. Price: 2/5.... WAAAAY overpriced. Even more than the original. This is really what keeps me from coming back more often.   6. Paddlings: 5/5... I can't personally attest (I swear!)... but these ladies can swing a paddle. Be careful what you ask for if you've had a few steins and think the whole Yager shot followed by the paddling sounds like a good idea. The last one I heard echoed twice.   Overall a solid three. But if you take their claims to be an \"exact replica\" at face value you'll leave a little disappointed.",

Hofbrauhaus is a replica of some famous beer hall in Germany. Stepping inside, you get that cheery and boisterous Octoberfest vibe, with groups of strangers sitting together at long picnic benches and getting laminated. Hefty waitresses in flowy green Dirndls rush past you with large drink and sausage orders, and customary scowls. The food's decent enough, but forgettable. This is a place you head to for the experience.  Speaking of experience, if you do swing by this place, there is ONE THING you or one of your comrades must do: order the Jager shots that come with a spanking. Your shots come out, accompanied by a well-muscled woman with a firm wooden paddle and a chip on her shoulder. You know what happens next: you/your foolish friend leans over, and gets punished German-style. Expect a red mark on your posterior for a couple days. The sound when you get spanked here is shockingly loud by the way. Not that I would know.",

    "text": "I took my German family here while they were in town visiting my girlfriend and I (she's German). Wow, what a disappointment.   First of all, this place is priced like this is universal studios... Inside disneyland... Inside Disney world. Seriously. 16-18 dollars for 1 liter beer?! Ja, OK! That's a bit of exaggeration ( though the price is accurate), but the whole place felt like you were being hard sold to spend more money. I mean the desserts are TEN dollars! Items like that make this place outrageously priced, and not affordable for a regular visit.   The second part that was a disappointment was our waitress. She obviously didn't know much if anything about Germany or the menu, seriously mispronouncing a few items over and over even after my German family repeated it back the right way. Now, I'm not a stickler for doing some sort of accent or anything, but it showed a lack of authenticity there, and I appreciate a place that tries to give you the real feel (especially in Las Vegas!)  What's more, we felt like she was trying to push things on us, and the second we said hey... We had some coupons for 2 free beers with dinner... She became quite unfriendly and unhelpful. We got the impression we weren't spending enough money for her. I get being a server is difficult, been there... But we were a very easy table and the place wasn't nearly full. No need to flip the switch just because we aren't going nuts on ordering stuff.  I almost laughed out loud when she came by with a \"retail menu\" and told us to order our gift shop items through her so that she gets the credit...really? I can't remember the last place a shopping menu was pushed on you.   We also didn't particularly enjoy the music, it's very cheesy, and since my family isn't from Bavaria, they could not stand that kind of music haha we were excited to leave.   To be fair, the bratwurst sampler dinner and the schnitzel were decent quality, which is what earned this 2 stars instead of one. However we saw a really strange pattern at our table and the tables around us... Orders came out no more than 5-10 minutes after being placed. Like our full entrees! I've worked at enough restaurants to know there is some serious pre-cooking going on back there, as nothing can be cooked to order so fast. At this price, that's just another reason to not go back.",

But the atmosphere the quality of the beer and the service make the price worth a stop in! I am a huge fan of the Heffeweizen, it is a True Bavarian Heffe with a lot of flavor, and it goes down smooth, especially on a hot Vegas Afternoon. I usually sit at the bar, and the service has always been good, and the staff are friendly.  There is a large open dining hall, and an outdoor area as well for dining and drinking. There are usually live bands in the evenings, and the place can get pretty lively with folks just eating and drinking and having a good ole time! This place is without question worth a stop in if you are down on Paradise or staying at the Hard Rock Hotel. Stop in have a beer and maybe a bite to eat and soak up the fun and atmosphere of the place while you're at it!",

I don't know what it was, but the bratwurst and sauerkraut, along with a huge stein of beer to wash it down was amazing.  Also, you walk outside and you're in downtown Munich, with all of its culture.  One time when taking a cab back to the Vegas airport, I saw this spot and was again enamored.  On my next trip, my friends and I went there for lunch.  The food and beer was once again top notch.  I think they must fly everything in from Germany or something.  However, the atmosphere was another story.  It didn't have the same energy level that the Munich location had.  Also, their attempts at creating a local experience (having performers on stage) seemed more like Disneyland than actually being in Germany.  To top it off, the location sort of sucks.  While its ok if you want to drive, its pretty far off the strip.  Everyone knows that when you go to Vegas, you want to be right by the strip.  At least the Carnegie Deli was smart in selection a Vegas location right at the Mirage.  But, I digress.....this spot still has great food and beer and one should expect everything in Vegas to be fake.  So, until I have the time to go back to Vegas, this place will definitely suffice.",

Very loud, sitting on wooden benches with other beer-swilling, shnitzel-eating, tankard-clanking Tutonics.  If you are hard of hearing, bring pencil and paper to communicate with friends.  Servers were excellent.  Food great but tastes better when you are drinking beer.  While you eat, there's a German band playing (even though they did play Sweet Caroline while we were there, which was super).  A dude played the Star Wars theme on a big horn (like the cough-drop alpine horn).  A dude also broke some record of holding a liter of beer with his arm fully outstretched...history was made while I downed jaegershnitzel (spelling...help).    Oh, and lest I forget, a lady walks around with a wooden paddle and will spank you as you \"assume the position\" at your table for only a few bucks.  Fancy that...I guess it helps the digestion?

My late father went to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich more than 30 years ago and loved it.  (He is the tie breaker here- making this a 5).  My family members followed him and we all went there in Munich several years ago. We all loved the entire experience there.  This was our first time visiting a Hofbrauhaus outside of Munich and we were pleasantly surprised.  Although the building is a lot smaller than its German original, it reminded us of the good times we had there.  It is not quite as good as the original but very close.  The interior is very similar, the music was excellent, and everyone there seemed to be enjoying themselves - including a bridal party.  The food and beer were excellent - not the normal US copy of a German restaurant but the real stuff.    Our first reaction was that it is a shame that the restaurant is so far from the strip.  But if it was, it would be too packed to get in and it would be spoiled.  We highly recommend this place, it is definitely worth the cab fare.  Enjoy.",

The beer hall is painted very similar to its German patriarch and the smell of German cooking filled the air. I started off with a 0.5l dunkle as did my wife and we ordered a sausage sampler. The order came with potato salad, sauerkraut and a pair of pretzels. With the exception of the pretzels which were well overcooked the meal was a great sampling of food. Half way through eating an entertainer arrived playing traditional German music and did a great job getting the crowd involved. We decided to order another round, this time I ordered 1.0l helles, and stayed to enjoy the show. We both had a lot of fun singing and raising our mugs. If you are looking for an escape from all the loud Las Vegas bars and restaurants and want a truly unique experience visit the Hofbtauhaus you will not be disappointed.",

I could make this long and detailed, but for the sake of people actually reading, I'll try to do a quick version.  I had to take a few months to gather my thoughts in order to not be too cruel.  I wanted to yelp the moment I came back from this place, but I felt it'd be most \"fair\" if I wasn't as steamed.  So where to begin - oh yes.  Over priced boots.  We asked from the beginning what the cost of a boot was.  $20 is what we kept getting from \"A\" our waitress (I'll save her name - she was sort of nice). We signed this slip of paper that said boot was not replaceable if broken and beer was extra. Fine. So we asked how much the beer was. Again, kept hearing $20. I said, \"I'll just have the mini boot.\" \"Just get the regular one...it'll be the same price.\". Maybe it's my fault for assuming she was taling about the beer, but I guess she was talking about the boot. Some birthday paddle shots, dancing on the bench, and a few hours later...the bill comes. Boots cost us about 75 each!!!!!! Are you kidding? I mean we knew we had to pay for the boot and beer but calc'd it to about $40...not nearly double. So whatever we had a good time, were a bit peeved, but paid the bill. However, we just wanted to know why it cost so much and felt appropriate to ask...so we asked. That led to pointing fingers..we said we understood and wanted to just let them know for future customers' sakes. It boiled down to the confrontation of the manager and owner. Poor management...no solution rather kept adding to the problem. They even threw the waitress under the bus and blamed her for our unhappiness. Well now they just added on to it. The best part was when they wouldn't let us leave with beer in our boot. Damn, I paid 75 I better be a ble to take it out! Plus we were in Vegas!!!! By the hardrock!!! Not like we were in the boonie outskirts. After so much fighting with the management, we stormed out to the words, \"we're gonna call the cops!\"  I said, \"Go ahead!\"  Ironically we saw some cops outside and they never stopped us for our alcohol. In fact, thet were fascinated by the beer and asked where we got it. I said, \"down the street but don't go there. The management is awful!\"  Sigh. I still get heated. I think my comic relief was their attempt at making it better by giving us a round of Jaegar. No thanks. Second comedy act was the sweet fobbish Filipina lady who asked if I'd pay her bills if she got fired because I would walk out with alcohol. Hahahaha...poor lady.",

    "text": "ACHTUNG: the way this country is quickly lapsing into the Weimar Republic and with the depreciation of the dollar, I swear that the litres of beer at the Hofbrauhaus are CHEAPER than the ones served at the real Oktoberfest.  As a two-time veteran of the real Oktoberfest, the Hofbrauhaus in Las Vegas does its best to mirror a traditional Bavarian beer tent, and it almost succeeds - we have to remember we are in America and no matter how hard we try, we can't get as wild as our European cousins without shanking someone and the SWAT team is called in - aside from that, the polka band is great, the stein-holding contests are a hoot, and there are people standing on the wooden benches.  The crowd is fun, lively, and LOUD - another staple of Oktoberfest.   The menu here is almost identical to the ones in Germany, though I don't recall seeing pig's knuckles.  The servers are dressed in traditional costume, complete with tightly-corseted boobies spilling out for your viewing pleasure.  There is the expected portrait of King Ludwig II on the wall, and there is Lederhosen, naturally.  A nice touch was the band playing the Star Spangled Banner - which I think was an old British drinking song before F. Scott Fitzgerald's ancestor changed some of the words around.   I got the jagerschnitzel, which was excellent, though I will say the Spatzle was a bit blah - the kind I had in Regensburg at the Goldene Ente was the best (yeah, I'm a snob and a name dropper, what of it!)  Also, the steins for sale here in the gift shop are also cheaper than the ones offered up in Germany.  If Lufthansa is not your airline of choice, head over to Vegas - it's ALMOST the same, and you will have a good time.",

It was not very crowded yet it still took a lot of waitress hunting to get a refill of water (the heat/hangover combo of Vegas requires intense rehydration).   The menu is large portions of mediocre food at inflated prices. The best part of my order was the side of french fries, which says a lot.   It gets a star for the free beer chugging contest they put on, but besides that, the entertainment is very loud and distracting so that you can't have a conversation with your table. It is also not that amusing.   I walked away upset that I spent an upscale restaurant dinner's worth on TGI Friday's quality food served in a beer hall filled with sweaty midwesterners.",

    "text": "Have you ever had a party in which only a few people showed up, but you had the best damn party ever?  Well, I think it is fair to characterize this place as that.  Sunday lunch is not really crowded at all.  I suppose the high ceilings of the beer hall make the place seem emptier than it is.  There were probably 25 people or so here.  Live entertainment consists of a guy in lederhosen, doing his best to keep people pumped up.  He plays a music with a backup audio, do some beer tricks and play that super long horn thing.  Afterwards, he will go from table to table to chat and share a swig or two of beer.  If you are brave enough or not easily embarrassed you can earn some free goodies or beer by doing the chicken dance or even just guess the right number.  Foodwise, the portions are standard, you get your meat, potatoes and sauerkraut for $20 or so.  If you are pork or sausage averse, don't bother.  You can get a steak here, but why?  Two more comments regarding pricing and being 'touristy\".   This is a place where you will pay $7.50 for a half liter of beer.  5.50 for 1/4, 13.50 for a full.  Once you have a couple of beers, another liter sounds perfectly reasonable.  My bill for four was $180 with tip for a cheese plate, three entrees, one dessert and 3 liters of beer.  This place is for tourists.  I brought my cousin from Japan here.  I probably would not go out of my way to eat here.  Having said that, I think it is a good place to entertain.  Seriously, it's silly to expect this place to somehow replicate the experience of being in Bavaria.  There is a giant beer hall room which is the primarily room.  The beer garden room is for events or probably on busier nights.  Even though it says the beer garden is airconditioned, it is a bit hotter in there (maybe they didn't have the air on).  So have a good time, make sure you are well funded and don't expect to feel like you are backpacking in Europe.  Oh yeah and get a cab or walk across the street to the Hard Rock Casino and enjoy the scenery.",

They had this band that was playing great songs (Sweet Caroline was the first one they played when I got in there...THAT is fun to sing with a giant beer glass in hand...swinging it above your head).  They had a two story horn, similar to the Ricolla commercials, that they blew after hoisting it toward the ceiling.  There is a woman that walks around with test tubes and a bottle of Jaeger.  Should you buy a shot from this well-muscled woman, she makes you stand, with your hands on the end of the table, whilst she paddles you.  She does not hold back.  Apparently, in my highly inebriated state, I did not think she was hitting me hard enough, and asked her to paddle me and hard as she did the boys.  MAN did that sucker hurt!  SO much fun, though!  Also in my highly inebriated state, I convinced myself that I am fully bilingual and talked to a German man in, what I thought was, perfect Spanish.  Also, while swinging my giant beer mug where I thought was over my head, I smacked it into my tooth and it chipped.  I didn't fully remember this until the next morning when I found the chip.  This is besides the point, but pretty amusing to my bar-mates and I.    The food...I had some kind of cheese vegetarian thing.  I can't remember even vaguely was it was called, but it was so, so delicious, with shoe string onions on it!  Everyone in my party really liked their food.",

Having been to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, and Chicago, I was expecting a raucous time with lots of singing and beer.  This is exactly what I got when I walked into the Las Vegas location.    Come here for the beer and the ambience.  This is the type of place where it's almost guaranteed you'll be singing \"Sweet Caroline,\"  at some point in the night; Is there anything else you need for a great time?  BAH-BAH-BAAAH!!!  (Go ahead and belt out the chorus real quick, it can't hurt)  The beer is good, you can drink out of a glass boot, you can get a shot of Jagr (which is punishment enough) followed by a \"Dazed and Confused-esque\" paddling.  These waitresses don't mess around either, you can hear the slaps of wood on clothed butt cheeks echo through out the hall.    I would recommend avoiding the food, as it's a bit on the pricey side (the pretzels are great though) and coming here to socialize, enjoy some beer, and good music played by the band.  It does get loud, but if you're looking for a quiet place to drink beer and sing, check out the reference section of the library.",

    "text": "The Schnitzelmann hates what he must do here because he really believes in supporting unique places, especially one of only two authentic German restaurants in town. But if he is honest, 2 stars is about what the place is worth after deductions for the following:  One star must be deducted because of the exaggerated prices, which have risen regularly since the restaurant opened. Authentic ethnic cuisine can be had - even imported items - for lower prices than this at other off-Strip restaurants. The Schnitzelmann suspects that the Hofbrauhaus is mercilessly targeting one-time tourists, ignoring locals and practicing monopoly-driven price inflation such that if in Germany, the Bundesbank would immediately intervene.   Another star must be deducted for the noise level, particularly evenings. The Schnitzelmann has been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munchen and can verify the music in Las Vegas is authentic, but significantly louder than in the Old Country. It is near-impossible to have any sort of dinner conversation with bands imported from Deutschland playing \"Hang on Sloopy,\" \"Country Roads\" and other obscure hits amplified to ensure maximum volume.   A final star must be deducted for the service. The Schnitzelmann has known several of the waitresses personally and agrees they are of the finest personality away from the restaurant. Inside, though, the management seems to dictate that most wait staff push the more expensive items, rush customers out the door if they have not bought food or drink within a given amount of time, and be somewhat inflexible as regards splitting the bill. Always? No. But too regularly to ignore.  So we are left with two stars. One is for the high-quality food- all the items that can be are imported from Germany, including the fine beers on tap, and the Schnitzelmann has never had a bad schnitzel, wurst plate or even salad here. The two potato salads on offer are also quite good and the Kaiserschmarrn dessert is made just as in Mad King Ludwig of Bavaria's day.  One star is granted for the party-hearty atmosphere. The Schnitzelmann celebrated his bachelor party here and the long benches and tables and free-flowing beer made it easy to make new friends and revel in the waitresses spanking customers who request it. The same atmosphere (minus spankings) can be had during World Cup and European Cup Fussball matches, which are televised live and to which many knowledgeable and enthusiastic German fans come.   But as regularly as Schnitzelmann comes here, there is always a sense afterwards he could have spent his time and money better elsewhere and that were he not such a fan of German culture and were there other German places in town, he would be at the Hofbrauhaus considerably less often.",

Don't get me wrong, it's not that I don't like it, I just had no opinion and don't consider it at all when I think about what I'd like to eat. I walked by this very large building too many times and convinced myself I should stop in.  Impressive. Huge ceilings and lots of space, exactly what I would picture a drinking hall to look like. The gift shop seemed kind of cheesy but I put that out of mind as I sat down.  First off, this place is really intended for groups. Large tables with bench seating simply screams party. And there was a party going on with a performer. Overall the experience is pretty intimidating. Sat down, ordered some beer and spent maybe 20 minutes looking over an incredibly large menu.  So far, it's a 3 out of 5 experience, but the food was really good. Nice fresh pretzels with homemade mustard. Good currywurst, and an even better jagerschnitzel. The beer, well, it seems to have high scores but I didn't find them particularly interesting. I don't claim to have the golden tongue, but different strokes for different folks. By the end, I was even enjoying the performer and his silliness.  Must visit? Maybe not, but it's worth going to. I've been trying to find local German places to see how it compares, so, mission accomplished, I now consider this style of food.",

All the wait staff was near the kitchen talking with one another. No one came over until I frantically waved at the manager. Finally a waitress came over. I ordered the sauerbraten which I had always liked. It was tuff and chewy. I had them take it back and replace it with the swinebratten which was just OK. .I when to their restaurant last winter in Pittsburgh and it was worse.",

Happy hour at the bar is a great deal for sausage samplers and their draught beer.  Mashed potatoes and potato salads also very tasty companions.   Longer walk from the strip than I expected based on my simplistic map.  After a few beers, the walk back was much shorter.    Live music inside, not available at bar.  Inside looks like a grand time, with singing and drinking.  Worth a visit with friends when in Vegas.",

Made a reservation for no reason since the place was dead ( Ironically they at 1st wouldn't let us make a reservation because they said that they had over 600 and couldn't fit us in) Told the hostess we would like to sit by the stage and they tried sitting us literally in the opposite corner.  I told them I wanted to sit in one of the many empty tables by the stage.  They then tried to sit us closer but behind a huge column that completely blocked our view. I refused it so finally they put us in the original table I asked for (Remember this place was dead with like 10 people there). The food is ok, but no substitutions (not even the type of mustard). Our server was good,  but nobody did anything for his birthday. I tried to get him a shot or some activity.  NOTHING. Very little if any German music and no activities.  Just blah. Complete waste of a birthday dinner. We used to bring groups here,  but never again.  It has no German charm left and isn't even worth considering.",

    "text": "I had my hopes up for this place. Walking in it seemed like a fun atmosphere, but quickly it felt like more of a tourist attraction. From the start our server was trying to get us to buy raffle tickets. It didn't stop there. When she would check on us, she was saying things like \"if you like the taste of that, we sell it in our gift shop\" and at the end of the meal even asked if she could walk with us to the gift shop (we told her that we didn't want to go earlier and thanked her for the info) to pick somethings out so she could meet her goal since she was in the lead for some sort of competition with the other employees for work. To put people on the spot so many times is rude. Ask once and if the customer is interested they will tell you!   What encouraged us to come here was because I have family here in town that is hosting an exchange student from Germany and I thought she would not only like this place, but maybe feel a bit of home. We sat at nice long table that is shared with the other customers. I don't personally like that, but that's the theme here so it was fine. There was live music being played which was cool.   Priced at $19.99 we started out with the \"Sausage Tower\" at the suggestion of our server. She said it was a \"hidden\" menu item since it isn't on the menu and it would give us a good taste of the different sausages they have. Sounded good to me! When it arrived, it looked like a tower of heaven. There were 3 dishes. 1 dish had chicken bratwurst, pork sausage and veal bratwurst on a bed of sauerkraut. The 2nd dish had krainer, grilled weisswurst and a frankfurter with potato salad. The 3rd dish had 2 fresh baked pretzels with 2 types of dipping sauces. Of all the sausages I only really liked the taste of a couple of them, so it was nice to be able to sample it all instead of just ordering a certain sausage dish that I might have had a type of sausage in it that I wasn't to find of. The pretzels were pretty good and the mustard sauces had good flavor. For my meal I had priced at $4.95 a \"House Salad\" and priced at $14.95 the \"Grillhendl\" which is a chicken dish. The salad was average, but the chicken dish was above average. The chicken was roasted and stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions. The chicken was crispy and had a good flavor. It also came with a side of potato salad that was decent.   I certainly didn't leave hungry! I didn't leave feeling like I would come back though either. The vibe inside just screamed \"gimmick\" and \"tourist attraction here\" which our guest from Germany agreed. The server was just too pushy about trying to get us to buy different things. My husbands meal was a joke especially for the price, so I lucked out with the chicken dish I ordered. I'm glad I experienced Hofbrauhaus at least once.",

In Vegas, the Hofbrauhaus is one of my favorite spots. It's a lovely change of pace from the strip and a little piece of Munich in Sin City.   You can get a large variety of Bavarian items: beer (of course!), pretzels (yummo!), sausages, schnitzels, strudel, etc. I'm thrilled that they offer Obatzda. If you haven't had this, you should try it. It's Brie mixed with butter, cream cheese, and paprika. While not as delicious as the stuff in Munich, it's still fabulous. That, a pretzel, and a dunkel and I'm a happy girl.   There's also entertainment. It can get a bit cheesy, but is always fun. Yes, you can do the chicken dance here. And there are stein holding contests, chugging contests, and you can get a brisk swat on the butt with a shot.   Prost!",

The German music and cheery toasts, however, are lost on most of the cliental though.    Food is typical German but not much variety.   Germans eat a lot more than sausages.   The potato pancakes are pretty awful though and are not served with apple sauce like they should be.   There is a small gift shop if you want to buy some beer to go, a lederhosen, or some jam.    If you are dying for revisiting your German roots, it's worth a stop.",

Our group sat in the back within the bier garden area.   I was entertained during the meal when other people ordered shots and got a paddling. My husband at a conference a few years ago had experienced this and said they really know how to give a paddling.  The beer was delicious and tasted authentic.   We ordered the pretzel for sharing and it was nice and fresh.   My husband and I split the half of the chicken. The chicken was yummy and moist (I hate that word!!). The potato salad was only okay but I am not a potato salad fan.   Would I come here again? I would for the novelty factor and makes me miss my time spent in Germany.",

    "text": "I went to dinner with a friend while in Las Vegas for a week.  Since I was on a per diem and only ate out once a day, the price of the meal was not a major issue. My friend ordered the Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte: Vienna style frankfurters, pork and chicken sausages, imported Sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and spicy onion mustard. I took the Grillhendl; roasted half chicken stuffed with parsley, beer butter and onions served crispy brown with homemade Bavarian potato salad.  I added a side order of Gurkensalat. My guest was not a fan of mashed potatoes and was somewhat disappointed that they could not be exchanged for something else.  I noted that there was no bread an butter on the table, but I won't hold that against them considering the fact that my meal came with potato salad and Spatzle which more than compensated for any missing bread. The Hofbrauhaus features live music and offers the opportunity for dining guests to dance on stage. One of the somewhat vulgar features of the Hofbrauhaus is that shots are served from a wooden paddle (that can accommodate up to six glasses).  Wooden paddles are also offered to guests who would like to be spanked by the waitstaff.  (cf.: <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.hofbrauhauslasvegas.com%2Fblog%2Fgive-us-a-shot%2F&s=9be4b23d22c23c5b0622f7632a42792ea2b8d9793181bc2272ca0416923f3a3c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">hofbrauhauslasvegas.com/...</a>) The music and food were truly authentic.  Large and long wooden tables could comfortably accommodate groups while providing smaller groups the opportunity to dine by themselves.  There is also a Hofbrauhaus gift shop at the entrance. If you want authentic Germanic cuisine while in Las Vegas, I would certainly recommend the Hofbrauhaus. Be advised, however, that if you have a car, don't mind a drive, and want to dine in an atmosphere that is somewhat more intimate, you might consider the Cafe Berlin.  I had once recommended them the last time I was in Las Vegas.  Both offer excellent food!",

    "text": "I have been to the Hofbrauhaus in Munchen, so it was a must do for us to check out the Vegas version.  Its a scaled down model of the original located on the corner of Harmon and Paradise, diagonally across from the Hard Rock Cafe.    The inside looked like the shrunken version of the original one, down to the tiny stage for the band.  Sadly, it also lacked a lot of the charm the original one had.  If the restaurant wanted to provide the guests with the \"typical\" German aloofness to their service, they did that well.  The staff wasn't overly friendly, and it seemed the hostess or the gift shop clerk really didn't want to be there.    Well, I guess you don't visit this place for service, but for, what else? the beer! The beer was good, and I guess for $7.99 not the most expensive one we've paid for. The sodas though.. close to $4 for a soda! Ouch.  The price of 2 sodas came to the price of 1 beer?  The lunch menu was decently priced, with plenty of of German comfort dishes, it was hard to pick just one. Eventually Stephen and I picked the Jagerschnitzel (breaded pork with mushroom gravy) with Spatle, while his mom had the Schweinebrauten (roast pork). The food wasn't bad. Generous portions for lunch. We were so full from the meal, that Stephen's mom skipped dinner.   We were surprised there were a lot of German speakers inside the restaurant.  The manager, Tony, walked around and chatted with the people in German, but wasn't able to say hello to us.  After lunch we went to the Beer Garden and checked it out, and then took a free souvenir photo at a kiosk near the Beer Garden.  Overall a 3 1/2 star experience.",

We ended up ordering some food to go because everything they had to taste was so good and I was also impressed that they had vegan food options on their menu for our vegan son.

The reason for only three stars is that I found the overall experience to be just that, an experience. There are only a few of these restaurants so they are unique and therefore the experience provided is one that people want to try here mainly because they lack the ability to indulge in solely German beers and foods anywhere else. It is a gimmick, and because they own the market on the gimmick, the food is just ok. The beers were tasty, but it's hard to mess up a pilsner.   I am glad I went once, but now that I have? I won't need to return.",

The large venue was part German style beer hall and part frat-house style party. People were raising their steins, singing along to German songs, then bad 80's music all while getting \"spanked\", both literally and willingly, by their dirndl clad beer maidens. The MC- who was quite the entertainer- was rallying people up to partake in a quarters style game with winners walking off with a coveted half liter of beer.  The selection of food was traditional German faire. I don't eat sausages, but they had a decent selection of other meat choices including a veggie option. The beer is traditional Bavarian imported directly from Munich. They have only 2 restaurants in the US with the other being in St. Petersburg, Florida. I felt fortunate I be able to experience this one.  The most impressive item at Hofbrauhaus was the humongous Bavarian pretzel, which I had to order. And the two mustards they served alongside were divine.  I'd recommend HB if you are looking for a unique experience off the strip. And you like beer. And of course pretzels! Prost!",

The live music and decor set the tone for a year round Oktoberfest experience.  Family style seating on benches, but still giving enough space that you aren't elbow to elbow with anyone. Service and food were both good. If you're feeling a little wild you can receive a public spanking from one of the fraulines. Be warned, they hit hard! It sounded like a whip cracking every time. Not for the faint of heart (or sensitive cheek).   It's on the pricey side and can get really noisy, but overall Bubs and I had a good time.

Service was excellent, however, and my Weiner Schnitzel with mushrooms was pretty good. The portion size was a bit large, the textures varied and taste was as I had hoped.   An interesting added feature was that on stepping outside, the airplanes were right overhead and quite thrilling to see how close they came to our hotel, Hyatt Place, which is right there.

We came with a large party and a bachelorette so of course I was hoping for the crazy party I had experienced the time before.  The experience is always a pretty fun one.  Of course the bride got the paddle, but I would say it wasn't as exciting without a crowd to cheer it on.  The service was just okay.  A few people at our table didn't get their food for quite a long time, making them miss the beginning of the show we were headed to.  All in all I would say this was not near the same experience as I remember.",

I will say the food was alright (not 100% the same but was ok) and beer was German. Two things I did not like was no substitutions. Like I can't change my Mashed Potatos for Potato Salad, but I can always buy the side instead. 2nd thing was that they were always trying to sell you something. Do you want to pay $25 for two pictures in a cheap 25cent Chinese frame? Want to buy a shirt? or this? or that? Do it German style and let people eat without you trying to sell stuff all the time.  On the good, the German band was great, the beer was really from Germany, and the food was pretty good.",

This is a great beer hall.  My first time was about 8 years ago.  It was an amazing experience.  Each time has been memorable for one reason or another.  Usually because of the phenomenal beer, other times because of the shots.  This past time it was more subdued.  I brought a few guys, but it was midweek.  Not much was going on.  The band was playing, which was enjoyable.  We got our beers and I decided these guys needed the shot and smack treatment.  Our waitress was a tiny young lady, how bad could the paddle possibly be.  The old Vegas bait n switch was in full effect.  This woman came out and we all gulped.  Let's just say she knew what she was doing.  Anyway, this place is great for food, as well as the beer.  Don't pass it up.",

I ordered the sausage with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes and mustard. It was gross. Sausage had no flavor and was undercooked and just a poor quality. The mashed potatoes were weak. The sauerkraut was literally mush. It's supposed to have some sort of texture. I can not recommend this place.   I will say the entertainment was pretty good though.  If you want a beer and some music this place is fine. Stay away from the food if you are expecting anything resembling the food in Munich.",

I stopped by here as a halfway fuel & food point from Utah to Las Angeles for lunch.    This was by a long shot the best German food I have ever had.  German food is not a culinary wonder and tends to be one of those ethnic foods you either love or have no interest in at all. Having spent plenty of effort seeking out German food I feel pretty comfortable making the claim this is the most well prepared and tastiest I've ever had.    The service was fast, friendly, and seemed to be happy to be working there rather than just going through the motions of serving a plate.  I absolutely plan on making this place a stop every single time I'm in or near Las Vegas.  It's worth the detour.  My only regret is that I came for lunch and not on a weekend night to capture the full experience of Oktoberfest and the warm, welcoming, festive feeling of a proper German beer hall. Plus, the more dirndls the better!",

The food was great, just like I remembered in Munich.  The beer was great, just like I remembered in Munich.  Gotta love 1 liter steins!  The jaeger shots followed by a paddling?  While loads of fun... I don't quite remember that experience in Munich.  Carla and friends got a good laugh out of that one.  Apparently my shot to the toosh was super loud and could be heard despite the loud music.  It was difficult to appreciate how loud it was considering how much it hurt....",

IT WAS $14.  we had no idea.    Then, we ordered a GLASS (not a gallon) of milk for our child.  THAT was $3.50.  I have NEVER been charged that much for milk.    the beer wasn't good enough, nor was the atmosphere, to make up for those ridiculous charges.",

It is located near the Hard Rock casino and easy to get to by cab from most other casinos in Vegas.

I don't know what they brought me but it wasn't a jager.  Very bland and tasteless. Wait staff were generally surly and not happy to be there. Also the beers--which were quite good--were not filled to the measuring line like they do in Germany.  When you are paying $14.95 for a liter of beer, you expect a full mug. I asked my waitress about this and she said there was nothing she could do about it because the mugs were filled automatically.   Wrong answer. The band was decent.  For music and beer, not a bad place but it was my second visit and I arranged to stay nearby just so I could come to this place again.  I will not be back.  They need a lot of work as a waitstaff and in the kitchen to live up to their potential.",

When ordering we told the waitress to put our orders on seperate checks and each couple or person told her that as well when she took their order. When we went to check out she was all flustered and confused. She didnt know who ordered what?! At one point she said the more bills you want the longer it will take. Come on, every resturant can seperate their bills, what is the big deal! We asked for the manager several times. But he did nothing to help when he came to our table. Not sure we were really dealing with the manager. The waitress kept lying to the so called manger saying we all said it was okay to do one bill. During all this we kept being ingnored so she could help her new tables. When she needed to finish with us. I finally told my friends and family just leave your cash and lets go. Some people paid and left. Than my husbands parents got their bill for $200 bucks when they only ordered 2 pretzels and a meal. They were trying to bill them for peoples food that already left. So again I told them leave cash for the correct amount and lets leave. My best friend ended up yelling at the so called manager as we left telling him we know the bill is $200 but that is not correct and you need to get it right. Its crappy they disappointed 17 people that will never be back to that place. I also emailed the resturant directly the day after and have not heard anything back. Bad customer service all around from that place.",

For instance, if you don't like potato salad you will be expected to have the potato salad \"held\" from your plate and pay $4.99 for a different side. All sides are listed as $4.99, including the one you just had \"held\" from your plate, so why refuse to be accommodating to a customer who is already paying $19.99 for a lunch entree? This is especially difficult at a place where most of the sides are like it or leave it options like red cabbage and sauerkraut. I couldn't find two options that looked appetizing so I watched the rest of my party eat and sipped my water. My husband ordered the 306 and was underwhelmed. We ended up spending $7 for my daughter to eat a dry pretzel after they tacked on a $4 upcharge for cheese she couldn't stand. Their Radler is mixed with Sierra Mist, which is close to heresy. All of this from a girl who was born in Germany and loved the food. This place is a tourist trap with good beer.",

(Turned out to be a big mistake as Hard Rock is a terrible hotel choice)  We went for Valentine's Dinner. How romantic is that, right?!! I made reservations even though they weren't needed. When we entered the restaurant, there were approximately 10 people waiting for a table, but we were seated right away.  Make sure you get one of the $12.95 pretzels as an appetizer. Best thing on the menu!  There was a special menu available including:   + Tomato Cream Soup garnished with Pretzel croutons and chives. Delicious! + Chicken Schnitzel garnished with green asparagus and sauce Choron, served with parsley Yukon Gold Potatoes. Sadly, this plate was sold out by the time we got there. :( I ended up eating an enormous plate of sausage. nom nom nom. + Valentine's Crepe \"Romanoff\" served with vanilla ice cream, marinated strawberries and whipped cream. They have an amazing whipped cream.   One of the fun things about this place is watching the all female chugging contest. The women all introduce themselves before downing their beer. Based on their looks, we placed bets on who the winner would be. I went with a puffy faced girl wearing a Wisconsin sweatshirt (how could I go wrong!?). The winner ended up being some girl from Santa Barbara with NO gag reflex what-so-ever. She didn't breathe once while downing her beer. (I'm fairly certain all females from Santa Barbara have no gag reflex, but that is for another site.)  One strange part of the dinner was the main guy on stage wearing lederhosen. He was announcing everything and singing on the microphone. He honestly sounded like Alvin from the Chipmunks. It was so bizarre.   One of the better moments was another guy blowing the \"Alphorn\". There was a wedding party eating dinner and they got the bride up on stage. She was wearing a tiny skirt and they placed the large end of the Alphorn between her legs and.......well....... they blew her. Watching her face was hilarious. The horn blower announced that she was now \"ready to go!\"  Ahhhh, good times Hofbrauhaus! See you on our next trip to Vegas.",

This is purely a place for 4 or more friends to gather, drink some German beer in the faux beer hall, share appetizers, laugh and that's it.  We ordered the crispy pork shank, sauerbraten, black forest cake, and of course beer.  Best part was the beer and watching people around us get whacked in the bottom with a paddle by the waitresses.  Fun for groups and beer.  Go somewhere else if you want to eat.",

I have to say that they did an awesome job recreating the Hofbrauhaus experience in Vegas. There aren't a lot of places where you can eat great German food, drink beer out of liter mugs, play drinking games, and sing polka with a 100 complete strangers. If you like dark beer ask for the dunkel because its the most delicious thing you will put in your mouth. I always make my friends come here whenever we are out Vegas, and its consistently been a fun way to start the night.",

    "text": "We've been to Hofbrauhaus on previous visits to Vegas and always had a good experience.  After this trip, I have no desire to go back.  We were there for an early dinner, so the service was bit rushed since they weren't busy yet.  We ordered a pretzel for an appetizer.  I recall them being served warm.  This one was cold, so it was just OK.  After being asked several times, we ordered the Veal brats for dinner - it arrived within minutes, so it was all pre-cooked apparently.  This made me very glad we hadn't placed the order earlier.  The meal actually was delicious.  That was the best part of the evening.  What really put a damper on the evening, though, was ordering a shot at the end.  Don't order a shot unless you want a big welt on your butt!  We didn't realize this was the consequence.  On previous trips, members of our party had ordered a shot and did not get whacked.  This time, the staff was very eager and insistent about it.  I was very uncomfortable and was going to leave it (my boyfriend ordered the shot for me), but he finally drank it.  A server other than ours was instantly over and eager to deliver the punishment.  She was actually kind of mean about it and my boyfriend still has a welt on his behind 5 days later.  I guess they get a twisted satisfaction out of being mean to the people to leave them tips for slightly overpriced beer and food.  I was mad because he was really looking forward to going and ended up being in pain for the rest of the evening and the next day.  Hofbrauhaus definitely won't be on my list of places to go on my next trip to Vegas!",

There's actually a second part of the restaurant in the back called the beer garden if you don't want to be overwhelmed by the band and ruckus.

Ok so here's my deal. Location...across from Hard Rock. Ok that's decent if there wasn't so much construction on this street. Parking is in the rear, it's not so bad getting in as long as you don't have old people blocking the walkway to the entrance. GRRRR WALK FASTER OLD PEOPLE!  So the beer is big and bitter served by good strong german women.  Pretty decent, Octoberfest beer. You also have the dark ales and a few different lagers. Seriously...who likes German food. Kraut, Vienerschnitzle which is a breaded pounded peice of meat....sausages...and spaetzle.Bleah. Needs ketchup or somethin. Dessert was a black forest cake. Eh...nothing really popped out at me. The food was eh....beer good. Polka band with a leiderhosin group of Original Polka Gangstas leading the chicken dance to tourists and kids who don't know any better that dance will get their butts kicked in school.  So to experience this German flair, go for it if you want to try a new experience. But I just think Vegas has more to offer than that.",

    "text": "Germany in Las Vegas!  I am impressed by this restaurant since it manage the fine art of creating an authentic German vibe similar to what you get in cities such as Berlin and their traditional establishments. The menu and ambiance completes this illusion and you get the feeling that you have been moved over to a classic beer hall with everything in place such as schnitzels with spaetzle and a nice vaulted interior.   The food is good and hearty with great taste and it is easy to share a dish for lunch since it is plentiful. If you haven't been to Germany yet but is interested in sampling it - do yourself a favor and visit Hofbrauhaus. I must also say that it reminds me of similar establishments in Prague such as the Plzenska Restaurance in the Municipal Building (Obecni Dum).  This is one of the best \"recreations\" I have visited in the case of ethnic restaurants - they really nail the atmosphere and the food perfectly. The schnitzels are highly recommended and very tasty and authentic.   The building is also nice in itself; it really stands out in the area.   It is also easy to buy a memory to bring home since there's a nice little gift shop at the entrance with beer glasses, post cards and classic Lederhosen, which is nice touch.",

A large spiral cut Munich radish served with rye bread. Really unique and refreshing. The atmosphere was definitely Munich beer hall. We had jaeger schnitzel as the main course along with red cabbage and spaetzle. All very authentic but the schnitzel could have been a bit more flavorful. The folks had sauerbraten which was wonderful. Entertainment was provided by a duo who played a number of different instruments from the keyboard to accordian to alpenhorn to musical bells. And of course all were entertained every time a customer ordered a shot and received their traditional paddling to go along with it. All very entertaining. And the beer of course was Hofbrauhaus right out of Munich served in 1 liter or .5 liter steins.  Our waitress was probably not the friendliest I have encountered but she did her job.  All in all a very pleasant evening. My father-in-law was stationed in Germany in the service and he said it was just like being back in \"the old country.\" We'll be back next time we're in the city.",

    "text": "Update - based on the reply. The song they were \"playing\" was not live - it was on tape and they were screwing around dancing to it onstage - but it seemed to be more for them than the audience. The rest of the time they were drinking talking to each other and walking around on stage NOT playing for about an hour. We were actually surprised that the manager didn't say something to them after she spoke with us - I guess she misunderstood our comment to her about the band.  Like I said before, we always come here when we're in Vegas, so we were really really disappointed this time. That's an expensive beer and sausage for just sitting there with no entertainment except a tape playing (not even German/Octoberfest music).",

Love the decore and set up, it reminds me of the old German style mess halls, with high ceilings and those long tables.   The food is 10 out of 10. The customer service was great too. The ladies have traditional German dresses, but none of them speak any German. I was hoping I could speak some German with a few good folks, but we still had a great time.   I ordered the Panierte Schnitzel with Jaegersose and Mushroom gravy. Delicious. Spaeztle was good too. We also had the pretzel and their beers are HUGE.   Glad we found this place and I'll be back next time we're in Vegas.",

Let's face it, you can't get good gluwein anywhere else and they know how to do specialty meals like St. Patrick's Day and Thanksgiving.  It's not perfect, and they continue to make mistakes by not bringing in the best entertainment, but they do make an effort.  So here's a toast to Hofbrauhaus a one of a kind!",

Because of its popularity, do call for seating but if you choose to just take chance, it is a busy venue.   But the happy environment and people watching is always fun.

That being said, the Las Vegas restaurant does bring feelings of nostalgia with the high ceilings, large steins and German food.   This restaurant is large and if you come during the day, there is a lot of space and usually isn't very crowded. I've never been at night so I can't comment on that. I miss the rowdiness that comes with a large crowded tent but they try to make up for it with live music and games.   The steins are poured perfectly and the food is good! They've got lots of different options to satisfy your cravings. I love getting all of the different sausages with potato.   They have a gift shop in the front which is a great spot to grab some lederhosen or maybe just a stein to take home.",

It's away from all the action and pretty boring. They said there wasn't another bar inside so I guess a table would have been better even for a quick drink.   We ordered the giant pretzel combo and a couple beers (Octoberfest & Heffe)The beer was really good & not too pricey. The pretzel was light & airy...really good. It came with a sweet mustard, regular brown mustard, and some kind of cheese spread. Out of all the dippers we preferred the plain brown mustard. The cheese was mixed with butter and that's all I could taste. I asked the bartender  what  it was & she said it was Brie mixed with butter, cream cheese, and herbs. I did not taste any of that (except butter & maybe a hint of garlic) plus it was an orange color...possibly from paprika because it didn't taste like  cheddar either but who knows.   The free beer with Yelp check in is only when you order a entree so no freebies for us. Might go back to check out a keg tapping & sit at a table.",

Some of the best German food around the area. Three large sausages, sauerkraut, mashed potatoes, and a nice mustard. The outfits on the servers created an authentic feel.

    "text": "This review is long overdue....  While enroute to Las Vegas on a red eye flight, I was reading an in-flight magazine, when I noticed an ad for this restaurant.  The advertisement called them the first and only authentic German beer hall and restaurant to call Las Vegas, NV home.  Not only that...they're a replica of Munich's famed Hofbrauhaus but in an enclosed building.  There was also an ad that offered a free mug (per customer) of their Oktoberfest beer just for stopping in.  We were excited because we have never been to Munich.  Anyway, we arrived at the restaurant at lunchtime and there was a line of people waiting to get in.  The building is quite large and has high ceilings that makes you feel like you're under a huge tent with painted indoor gardens.  You could almost hear people's conversation echo about.  We were seated at a large community table as an attentive and friendly server came by.    We thought about ordering only a snack to take advantage of the free beer advertisement.   Our order consisted of 2 pretzels and 2 small (free) mugs of their Oktoberfest beer.  The beer was cold, crisp and clean tasting.  We were told that the beer is imported from the same batches as what is made and served at the Hofbrau tents.  We considered upgrading to a 1L stein but we knew that we had dinner reservations set for later that evening.  - Jumbo pretzel which was huge and served warm. There were two types of mustards and an Obazter (Obatzda?) cheese.  We were familiar with the mustards but the cheese spread/dip was deliciously different.  Apparently, it is a Bavarian cheese delicacy...a mixture of soft cheeses and butter.  - Jumbo pretzel with Bavarian Liver Mousse and Obazter (Obatzda) cheese.  The liver mousse was light and flavorful. I know, some of you might be saying \"Ewww\" but, it was really good.  I wished that there was a larger portion but, it would've been overkill.  We enjoyed both baked pretzels as they were served warm, soft and a bit chewy.  The pretzels and beers were perfect together and we were satiated.    But, then....I looked at their dinner menu and spied \"Schweinshaxe\" aka roasted pork shank with crispy skin!  OMG...I started planning our return because they serve this specialty after 4PM.  Alas, our stay in LV was only for a couple of days and as they say, \"our dance card was filled\".  So, just to keep my tastebuds focused, I borrowed the picture of that pork shank.  I WILL return.....  Maybe the oompah band will be playing.  #495",

    "text": "So I literally stop here every time I'm in Vegas, as it's kind of one of my \"go to\" spots in this town. Having said that, I thought I would finally give it a review.   I have always been very pleased with the beer and food selection, and this is one of the reasons that it's worth the mile and a half walk from the strip for me. I also like the live music in the German band, as that adds a nice touch.  The ambience is great in this restaurant, and if you have been to the original Hofbrauhaus in Munich, you will appreciate how authentic and similar it feels and looks. They even have a beer garden area in the back of the restaurant, which even further completes the feel. They used a long wooden tables like in the original one, and you often times have other people/families sitting on the other end of the table, which is kind of fun, as long as they're not Yankee fans (yes, I'm from Boston.)  The beer selection is somewhat limited, but that's also the point: The beers are all the Hofbrauhaus selections, and they are all delicious. They offer the different sizes as well, in case you can't handle the big tankard size! I will tell you that you are crazy if you don't order the large pretzel with the three different dipping sauces... It's absolutely wonderful! Just don't try to eat it on your own, as it will absolutely be a carb overload for you.   I do think the restaurant is overpriced, although it is also Vegas, so I understand. Making their drinks and food a bit more reasonable would probably drive more people here, though, especially considering that it is off the strip, and not as accessible to some people. If you are staying at the hard rock Hotel and Casino though, it is right across the street.   Hi prices aside, I will continue to stop at this place when I'm in town, as it offers a different vibe, it's off the craziness of the strip, and it's just plain fun!",

However, for a person like me, I would give it 3 stars for my experience though I think most people who love german beer and beer gardens and a good ole time this would be a great place to go. But for me personally, there really isn't much options to eat.  There is a vegetarian platter, potato pancakes, sides, and soups, but the platter isn't gluten free.  I have had two sides which was the red cabbage and the cucumber and the fries.  The fries are ok.  The red cabbage is SO sweet and vinegary that its barely edible.  The cucumber is the same way.  So not much to eat.  The entertainment and the ambiance is really cool.  I think they did a good job in having a cool and different german like place to party.   They have free parking valet if you are eating there.  The parking is in the back.  You can call to make reservations.  There is a store outside of the restaurant for souvenirs.",

    "text": "Oans, zwoa, g'suffa!  Okay, by no means am I a German food expert.  My knowledge on German cuisine consists of my neighbor's oma's cooking from my childhood.  Oma made some delicious food and it was the only non-Chinese food I got growing up.  I love Oma.  Mike W. had seen this place in those airplane magazines and had been wanting to try out this place for years now.  Boasting about being the only beer hall in Las Vegas, I can see the allure.  We shared the 310: NURNBERGER ROSTBRATWURST, the 305/6: WEISSWURSTE, and washed it down with a 17oz. Oktoberfest.    Guten Appetite!  310: NURNBERGER ROSTBRATWURST - Three pork sausages with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes.  It can't get any simpler than this.  This was listed as one of their Hofbrauhaus signature items and I enjoyed it!  I normally only eat sauerkraut on my bratwurst only and having it on top of the potatoes made it so much more flavorful.  I cleaned the plate.  The pork sausages were on the small and thin sized though so I was hungry like an hour later.  305/6: WEISSWURSTE - Two of Munich's famous white sausages (veal and pork) grilled with a freshly baked pretzel, served with sweet mustard imported from Munich.  Now these brats were legit.  Thick and juicy and full of flavor!  I got to admit that I didn't care much for the pretzel.  It was hard and crunchy.  I was expecting a soft pretzel considering it's suppose to be freshly baked.  The mustard was good though.  I slapped some onto the sausages and it was great.  This was also listed as one of their Hofbrauhaus signature items.  As for the Oktoberfest?  It was some good brew.  What else can I say?    Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas is a giant mammoth of a beer hall where they even have an indoor garden-esque beer garden set up with fairy lights for your pleasure.  Ladies are clad in dirndl and the men in lederhosen.  Buy your own dirndl for $100 in the giftshop!  The ceiling is so tall, you can't help but to look upwards throughout your meal.  This is like Hogwart's Great Hall for the beer lovers. Food is good but I did walk away hungry.  Noch ein Bier, bitte!",

While I'm enjoying my mediocre food during the \"October fest\" they're playing American sing along songs like Journey? Berry Mannilow?   Proud to be an American? Don't get me wrong, as a US Marine veteran, I'm as patriotic as one can get. However, it completely took the German vibe away from the ambience. Service was terrible. This place MIGHT be ok for a group of 6 or more, after pregaming.",

However, aside from the free 10 oz beer, I would not recommend the \"authentic\" cuisine.    Beware the up sell on sides and add ons... would you like a pretzel while you wait on your entrees ($14.00) Would you like your curry on the side ($3.00).  Can we take picture of your group? No thank-you!    I wish I could have given a better review... but, the four and five stars reviews that led me to try this restaurant were/are misleading.  Buyer beware... atmosphere and beer a plus... food and value a strong negative",

    "text": "I've driven by this place numerous times and after spending the day at the hard rock pool a friend and I decided it was time to give it a go.  This place is massive! Felt like I was walking up to a ride at a theme park. It is overall very themed. I definitely felt like I was submerged in a German pub. The live music and frequent toasts were a nice touch.   We didn't have reservations as it was early Tuesday evening and we just assumed they would have room to cram us in the grand hall. Thankfully they did, and for the majority of our meal we had a large family style table in the grand hall all to ourselves. We had a great view of the restaurant and the band. The walls were lined with their massive beer glasses. All wait staff were decked out in traditional attire that really help submerge you in the culture. By 7pm the hall was pretty much full so if you are visiting and know that you want to experience this place, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND MAKING A RESERVATION.  The menu is pretty extensive with schnitzel this and spatzle that. It all sounded pretty amazing. We decided to start with an appetizer- Obadtza -it was a small pretzel with a brie cheese blend and some veggies. The pretzel was very hard :/ and the cheese was not what we expected at all, it was like a cold cheese ball with some sliced cucumber, tomato and onion. The cheese itself was good. We found ourselves eating it by fork as the pretzel was practically inedible, as it was hard as a rock.  *This appetizer also came out at the same time as our food  -_-  Most menu items were pork based so unfortunately that left me with slim pickings. I noticed they had a chicken schnitzel on a bun, like a sandwich, but I was hungry and didn't want to just eat primarily bread. (Good thing I didn't order this because if their buns are anything like their pretzels then I would of been very disappointed)  *They do offer a vegetarian selection!  I ordered the vegetarian schnitzel because I felt like I had to. I was a bit dissatisfied as I expected their mushroom gravy or at least something to add flavor. I had two fake chicken (?) crispy patties that were perfect in texture but completely tasteless. The patties rested on a cold bed of cucumber/potato salad. This salad was very refreshing and seemed like something better consumed outside on a hot day at a BBQ. If it wasn't for the fresh cucumbers this salad would of been completely flavorless. I ate a plate of very bland food... like there wasn't even a pinch of salt :/  My friend ordered the Jagerschnitzel and said she thoroughly enjoyed it and would order it again.  Overall THE SERVICE WAS EXCELLENT. The theming was on point. I think we would return for a beer in the biergarten area. Their hefeweizen was very very good.   *Order a shot with a slap and get a spanking with your booze. Or take a family style shot with multiple people off a community board.",

And then the stressful part of getting interrogated by the hostess just to get in for a table. Name, email, phone number, really??! Information they don't need and should not be collecting just to have lunch. The place could be empty and they'll seat you right next to somebody else.   Once you get past all that, beer is great and the entertainment is great. Too bad it's such a deterrent to get in.   Having been to the other location in Munich many times, never being interrogated for a table, wish this location would follow suit change their ways.",

    "text": "One of the members of our hiking group came here a few times during Octoberfest for lunch and she convinced the group we should do this.  Knowing our hiking group, going somewhere for lunch after hiking is not a hard sell at all so we put this on our to do list.  We got there before they opened at 11 AM.  As soon as they opened, the 9 of us were shown to a long table in the main room with high, arched ceiling.  The set up consists of long wooden benches at long wooden tables.  Our server was Angela and she was terrific!  First drinks.  I got iced tea and my tea along with others who had been or soda were brought quickly.  Our orders were then taken.  I wanted to get something somewhat German.  My only experience with German food had been at Luchows in New York City many years ago.  I was never overly fond of German food despite it being half my heritage.  I got the wurstplatte, a sampling of three German sausages--a Vienna style frank, and one pork and one chicken sausage.  They were served on a bed of mashed potatoes topped with sauerkraut and served with a spicy onion mustard.  The sausages were OK--nothing outstanding--but OK.  The sauerkraut on top of the mashed potatoes was something knew for me but the two went together well.  I was surpirsed at how much of the mustard was gone when I was finished with the sausages.  Maybe I overdid it a bit so the sausages had a bit more flavor?  I was the only one to get dessert.  I got the Black Forest cake at Angela's suggestion and this was so good that it would be reason to stop in here sometime when I wanted a good dessert.  Creamy and very flavorful, it was a perfect ending to the meal.  And, the hiker who suggested we come here was the only one who got a taste of my dessert.  My question to the Hofbrauhas is, \"Why serve this piece of cake with 4 forks?  Do you think I'm going to share?\"  No way!!  Service was very good!  I will make a return visit some time and try a different dish but I'll go for lunch rather than in the evening when it will be loud with many beer drinkers banging their glasses and pretending to be in Munich.",

If I wanted a sports bar I'd go elsewhere. Call me traditional but the TVs take away from what the Hoffbrauhaus is.   If they didn't do this in Munchen, then they shouldn't do it here!",

    "text": "Having been to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich I was, uh, less than excited to be headed to this touristy knock off in Las Vegas. I was way wrong! Yes it is touristy and yes it is loud and crowded, but it was also a very fun!  There were 6 of us in our group and we all had a great time. We started out with a pretzel and giant beers, well the pretzel was giant too now that I think about it...anyway, both were dee-lish. I particularly liked the cheese spread and brown honey mustard dipping sauces that came with the pretzel.  I'm normally a fan of schnitzel, but I thought I'd try something different this time. I went with the Sauerbraten (German pot roast) and while it was very tasty, the meat wasn't very tender at all. Definitely not horrible, but I'll stick with the Jagerschnitzel next time.   Beer was flowing, shots were plentiful and a few in our group got spanked...literally...numerous times. Don't be a snob like I was - just because something's a little touristy doesn't mean it can't be a good time.   I go to Vegas for work A LOT - I'd happily go to Hofbrau again if for no other reason than to forget about work for a minute. And to grab a hot pretzel and cold beer of course.",

No private tables you will sit at a long table with a bunch of other people. We have dined here a few times over the years, brought some friends that enjoyed having German food. It can get quite loud, and can be fairly expensive but you do get quite a bit of food. The food its self isn't necessarily the best we have had, we have had better . The other place that was in town is now closed I am not sure if there is any other ones in town but this is not too far from the strip and really close to Hard Rock Casino. It is a place to come if you never have before you will enjoy yourself especially if you want to try some German Beer.",

Full of mushrooms...not a huge deal but it was Luke warm. Picked the mushrooms out and it was cold. 20 minutes later asked for a menu. I wanted to make sure I hadn't ordered something that the menu said was with mushrooms. The menu did not mention mushrooms on the dish. No one asked why I asked for a menu(like maybe I wanted to order something), no one acknowledged the full plate of cold food I had moved away from me. When the waitress asked if she could remove the plate (over a half hour after deciding it was full of mushrooms and cold) I asked that she take it off the bill. She did. In about an hour I had 1 beer. I wanted another but the waitress was MIA. Ordered one from the bar and after that left. Won't be back. Which is sad. Great place with great food or so I've been told. Just didn't experience it.",

    "text": "Here is a good place to get a PG-13 version of two Vegas staples--alcohol and breasts.  Just don't come here expecting traditional Bavarian culture.  While it's a hell of a great time, this Hofbrauhaus is not authentic.  I don't know how much they're trying to be, but they're not, and that's okay.  I have been to the real thing in Munich several times, and I assure you that the similarities are skin-deep (and even in Munich the HbH is the most commercialized of all the traditional beer halls).  This place looks beautiful, the beer is just as great (lager, dunkel, or hefeweizen--all are excellent), and of course the waitresses boast dirndls and bountiful cleavage.    In Munich, they do a brisk tourist business but there is a healthy local presence:  one room has a large rack covering one entire wall, like a wine cage, where the regulars store their personal steins.  In Vegas, the only locals are the staff.  The Munich HbH is a crossroads of the globe and you may make new friends from a dozen countries within a few hours.  In Vegas, you will meet people from Buffalo, Tupelo, and Modesto.  Still, you will meet people and have fun with them.  In Munich, the place is packed to the roaring rafters by 7pm.  In Vegas, the place is still half empty at that time and suffers from the loss of conviviality.  In Munich, an oompah band makes the rounds every half-hour or so.  In Vegas, three skinny white guys make do with guitar, bass, and keyboard.  Oh, and in Vegas there is a restroom attendant.  But that's all okay, because like I said, it's a great time.  There is still a lot of energy in the room, the staff are wonderful (especially our waitress Rebecca), and the beer and food are awesome.  DO NOT MISS the onion mustard and Obatzer cheese that come with the \"pretzel complete\" and check out the delicious crispy pork shank, after 4pm Saturdays only.  Plus they have added a uniquely American touch--whenever you down a shot, you get spanked by a waitress wielding a wooden paddle.  Those ladies mean business.  Great photo opportunity to embarrass your friends.  If you want to have a great time with a group of friends and get away from the standard debauchery, you cannot make a better choice than the Hofbrauhaus Las Vegas.",

Once for beer, which was great and fair priced for the quantity, and another time for the food. We ordered the sampler tower that came with three tiers of food. It was more than enough food to feed me and another person.  In actuality, the food is what really propels my rating of Hofbrauhaus to a five star. The sauerkraut and red cabbage are amazing. The spaetzle was especially fantastic. Overall the food reminded me of what I would have gotten back in Germany (I studied there for a summer). Truly amazing. I believe this ran about $20? So $10 for two.  My only gripe is with the waitress. We had gone during the holiday season, and she kept trying to hustle us to buy merchandise. Apparently the staff was having some type of competition. She kept hard selling t-shirts, mugs, and everything else to us when we had told her we weren't interested at the very beginning. It was actually very desperate and awkward. After our final decline it looked like she was pissed and then indifferent to servicing us at all haha. One of the stranger waitress experiences I've encountered in a very long time.  Nonetheless, that does not deter my phenomenal review of the food and beer. Just work on the service, Hofbrauhaus...",

I remember going there with a friend. I started off with a German salad. It sucked. I felt like I was eating a turd salad. When I received my entree, we both kind of looked at my plate and my friend acknowledged before I could say anything that it was indeed a hot dog that had been placed on my plate instead of a German sausage as advertised.  I ended up tossing the hot dog at the wall.  This place will definitely satisfy your desires if you're wanting to experience a bunch of loud, annoying drunk people pretending they're in Germany. What's that? Oh, you have a giant glass boot filled with beer? You better chug that down as fast as you can without breathing!  I bet this place has to employ a full-time barf cleaner for all the times people drink themselves sick, not to mention the people who throw up after finding out they ate an Oscar Meyer hot dog filled with chicken beaks and pig assholes.  And as I recall, the entree was rather expensive. You can save yourself a lot of money and have the same meal if you just go to the supermarket, buy a pack of hot dogs, warm them up in the microwave and dip them in mustard. And don't forget to play some annoying German music and sing \"ziggy zaggy ziggy zaggy oy oy oy\".",

My friend, who had been to the one in Munich, got all excited saying we HAD to go.  So we end up going and it was such a good time.  The live music is great, and so is the other entertainment they have going.  There is a ladies drinking contest (which I totally rocked out) and for the burly men, a contest where you have to hold a beer out at arms length for the longest.  You are also bound to make friends with the people who are sitting at the other end of the table.  The Jagermeister Mistress will walk around and offer shots - and spanks with a paddle, which is good entertainment, and my dream job ;-)  This place was a lot, lot, lot of fun and makes me glad I'm from the east coast so I can check out the one in Pittsburgh.

    "text": "[teaser review]  Food?  3 stars, bratwursts and schnitzels and obaszter, Oh my!  Drinks?  4 stars... ONE... LITER... BEERS.  I had two in about a half hour.  Fun?  5 stars.  Mona.  You reeled back and swung that paddle at my tush like it was a home run derby!  You said I must be used to eating sausage.  You called me a p*ssy for only throwing down 2 liters of beer.  I think I'm in love with you.  [end teaser]  ============  For starters, out party of twenty had the simple and accessible pretzel appetizer; a huge, coarsely-salted, baked pretzel served with dipping mustard (one tangy, one sweet) and a tasty obaszter cheese... This appetizer was unremarkable but appropriately festive for the beer drinking that would soon ensue...  As the fiery-spirited and lovely Mona made her rounds taking drink orders, our party would erupt into booing and jeers toward the few who ordered anything less than the 1-liter stein of beer, often harassing them into ordering big... I opted for the 1-liter dunkelweiss, a dark bier, toasty @ 5.5% alcohol.  Oh, if only they had the Maibock at the time (7.1%)!  The menu offers a varied selection of Bavarian dishes, many to do with wursts.  Most were of two varieties; either wursts(sausages) served in sandwiches (w/fries) or wursts plates (usually with cabbage, or potatoes - mashed or salad).  A number of dishes present the sausages afloat in a small cauldron of simmering beer/broth... tasty, but visually unappealing, IMO.  I went with the Riesenwurst, a grilled sausage with sauerkraut, served on french bread...   Making up for having slept through this part of the Vegas trip last year, I chug'd chug'd chug'd away, finishing my liter first, raising my empty glass to applause and laughs.  But as I reveled in my accomplishment, a dirndl-dress clad Mona would set down another liter in front of me... slack-jaw'd and puppydog-eyed, I looked at her.  Her response?  With a wink and a smile, she says \"Come on, I can put down 5 of these...\"  Somehow I got through it.  2 liters of dunkelweiss.  One riessenwurst and sauerkraut sandwich.  A pint of Summer bier.    Then she looked at me, \"... another?\" \"Oh dear gawd, no, please!\" I stutter.  She smirked and walked away.  I guess we weren't NEAR done just yet.  And then came shots of apple brandy served on a wooden paddle... and the paddling.  Yes, paddling.  With me bent over the end of a table, Mona reached into my back pocket to take out my wallet, insuring nothing would get in the way...  Twenty friends counted her down.. \"one\", \"two\", \"THREE!\"... as she swung for the fences... THWACK!!  I didn't flinch, but it hurt like crazygood!    Like crazy... good.  I asked for another. __________________________ Yup, kinda got a crush on Mona... Foul-mouthed, emasculating, paddle-swinging hotness.  I've got issues, don't I?",

    "text": "If you enjoy Oktoberfest everyday, this would be one place you need to go for that.  Thanks to our awesome tour guide Susan R., she introduced us to this place when we vacationed here in Vegas at the holidays. I think we asked what unique part of Vegas in that we the tourists don't know about. This was one of the place she suggested that was slightly off the strip.  To the drivers, you will need to be a little bit more careful as one portion of the street is an one way street in front of the parking lot. There are no issues with parking at this facility, but will have some anger management issues as the space to back up is very narrow. Avoid these clowns with some patience when you are trying to back out.  On a cool Monday night, it was very festive as we were seeing live performances of a cool Oktoberfest band dancing and singing. Like all German beerfest, they seemed to like long tables with picnic bench seats as a way to dine. The restaurant like a big cafeteria with benches in a conference hall. They have a very high ceiling where I can imagine a circus performing here on an off day.  To start off, we have one of their big pretzel special we had to try according to our waiter. He suggested this as they don't have this special often. The pretzel was huge and the three of us almost didn't finished that off. Lovely soft tender thing with the right dip tasted better than your Auntie Anne's soft pretzel.  I think I ordered the Nrnberger Rostbratwrstl which was a three roasted Pork Sausages with sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes  Believe me when I say that with a mug of beer, this thing would totally blew you away. These delicious suckas are roasted to succulent tease that can melt in your tongue.  Of course I had to weasel out by ordering root beer as I was already plastered earlier in the day with plenty of vodka drinks at the casinos.  Oh, please don't be a wuss by ordering burgers. You came all the way to this place and you knew this is a German sausage house and yet you still want to order burgers? Shame on you!  For the veggie lovers out there, they don't want to leave you out because they offering soups and salads to keep you from your meat eating significant others enjoying some good food. They want to make sure everybody is happy here.  The place is so happening, they decided that restaurant was not good enough so they add in a gift shop right in front of the entrance. Very clever of them to extract more money from you on the way out.  A real fun time that is better than Medieval Times or a Ninja sake tasting at a wine garden. Give this place so love as they also have a kids menu to bring your whole family to enjoy this unique experience.  It may not be the same beerfest as in Germany, but it come very close with their offerings and performances. The only thing I wish they had was having Helga bring the beers to us.   Oh that would have been so sweet!  Quality: ***** Decor: **** Service:**** Amenity: **** Ambiance: ***",

    "text": "Hofbrauhaus is a restaurant in Las Vegas that serves traditional and modern German food and beer.  I could tell that there was something different about this restaurant just by pulling up in the parking lot.  Three quarters of the parking lot is a wholly pointless valet lot.  I say pointless because the walk to the front door is pretty long, whether you park it yourself or not.  Choosing to valet will save you five steps....if you were able to choose.  A narrow catwalk wraps around the front of the building to the front door...not quite wide enough for two-way traffic. Once you're through the front door, you'll find a nice small bar to the left, a gift shop to the right, and double doors to the main dining hall straight ahead.  Loud music and a pleasant smell of baked sour dough greets you as your busty server seats you next to rosy-cheeked strangers... who can't wait to meet you (so poetic).  The dining hall is a large cafeteria-style room with high vaulted ceilings and hardwood picnic tables complete with benches (be prepared to rub elbows with strangers).  Paintings and decor give a very authentic Bavarian feeling to the place.  The music is performed by a live polka band.  There was dancing, singing, beer mugs held high in the air, and then clanking together, patrons being spanked by server girls...wait, what?  You'll feel like you just walked into an Oktoberfest festival. The dinner menu provides decent variety without sacrificing any authenticity.  For starters, I ordered the jumbo pretzel combo, which is a giant sourdough pretzel with course grained salt and comes with three dipping sauces...two types of mustard and a cold, spicy cheese spread.  I found the sauces to be good but the pretzel was too hard and heavy (but maybe it's supposed to be like that?).  For entrees, I had the rienbratwurst and my wife ordered the schnitzel sandwich.  The riesenbratwurst is about a nine inch pork sausage in a French bread hoagie with sauerkraut.  At first I thought it would be too bready as the sausage is only about one inch thin, but biting into it I found that it was pretty good.  The schnitzel sandwich is a large chicken breast pounded out flat, breaded and fried with tomato and lettuce on a large Kaiser roll, and we added Swiss cheese, it was quite delicious.  Both plates came with a large helping of decent thin-cut French fries. The beer is limited in variety but not in volume or flavor, and is proprietary to Hofbrau.  You have six beer types to choose from: the Original (lager); the Dunkel (dark); the Hefe Weizen; the Oktoberfest; the Maibock; and the Hefe Weizen Dunkel.  Order a beer by the liter and it comes in a large glass mug designed to withstand a direct nuclear weapon strike.  I ordered the Hefe Weizen.  This was a fantastic beer.  Amber in color, cold, sparkling, and distinct fruity notes.  By the time I was half way through it, my previous criticism of the pretzel vanished.  Now I saw the purpose of the pretzel's heft...to stabilize the flux of beer in my stomach. Overall, it was a great experience.  The level of social interaction can sometimes make you forget that they also have pretty good food.  But if you're not into German food, the experience of a Bavarian style beer festival alone (or the beer alone) will make it well worth the trip.",

    "text": "Maybe you'll be good enough for the front-of-the-haus \"hostess,\" Anna, but me and my family were not, and we're not even fat or ugly. We arrived with high expectations, having visited the \"real\" Hofbrauhaus in Munich, when my wife was pregnant with our oldest child and unable to imbibe. We were really looking forward to visiting the Las Vegas recreation, and while the food and atmosphere were good, the whole experience was really ruined when we walked in the door.  Walk in, and expect to be ignored. There's a bar to the left, but they aren't interested in those waiting for tables. A hostess station emphatically states to wait for a hostess to seat you .... and wait you will.  While waiting (and waiting) to bide our time, I wandered into the nearby gift shop, where I had actually planned on spending $100+, but decided to wait until after our dinner, and I'm glad I did.  The apparent hostess-in-charge, Anna, finally appeared, and me and my family were standing front-and-center before the hostess station. Yet, it was as if we were literally invisible to Anna. There was another party behind us in line (also waiting for a hostess to arrive), and Anna behaved as if we were just not there. Anna went out of her way to greet the party behind us, who graciously stated, \"They were here first.\" Anna then stormed off again, then came back, and asked the party behind us how many were in their party ... we were sure feeling the cold shoulder on a Monday! Eventually, after checking with Anna, a different hostess found the time in her life to lead us to a seat.  After that, our experience was great - we had an excellent waitress, Amanda, and our kids really enjoyed the authentic Bavarian music.  But I cannot get over how rudely we were treated by Anna - I spoke with the manager, who was very gracious, but I simply cannot recommend an establishment who employs someone to greet potential high-paying customers who behaves this way. Although the meal was good, I just wanted to leave ASAP because I was made to feel unwelcome from the moment I walked in.  No souvenirs to remember being shunned!  Auf Wiedersehen! Save your time and money for the Munich original - unlike Anna, they're happy to take your money and will treat you well. And for that matter, you'll have a much better experience elsewhere in Vegas.",

First off, make reservations!  You'll save yourself the headache and wait - do it online or on the phone!  And don't sit in the beer garden, you want to be in the hall for sure!  The special on Saturday is Frische Schweins Haxen. \"Crispy Pork Shank, served with Sauerkraut, HB-Oktoberfest Beer Gravy, Bread and Potato Dumpling\" for $19.50.  For anyone that knows lechon, this is crispy skin at its ultimate!  A fabulous job on making that piece of meat visually appetizing and tasty!   They were also offering their Famous Bavarian Dumpling Soup for $5.50 and the HB-Dessert Tower of \"Bavarian Cream with marinated Blueberries, Quark Strudel with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, and Black Forest Cake with Chocolate Sauce\" for $9.95.    One friend ordered #310 Nurnberger Rostbratwurstl. \"Sausage at its Best! Three roasted Pork Sausages with Sauerkraut and Mashed Potatoes\" for $13.50.  The sausage was pretty tasty with a good flavor.  I went for their side of Spatzel ($4.50) and Mushroom Gravy ($2.95) because it's something simple and I like their gravy sauce here.  We also enjoyed their seasonal roasted pecans and almonds.  By the back, there's a cart making roasted candied pecans and almonds for $3.50 a bag or two for $7.  Pretty yummy stuff, especially when the nuts are still hot!  Hofbrauhaus is a place with a great atmosphere where you are bound to chat it up and drink a bit with your neighbors.  It's definitely not a pretentious crowd here, and you'll see people from all ages doing shots of jager.  (Pics posted!)",

This place is a blast, not because of what I ended up with on my backside but because this is as close to an Oktoberfest atmosphere you'll find in the States.  Food is authentic German fest food.  Sausages, chicken, kraut, etc.  Constant German fest music, contests, singing with audience interaction.  A great time!",

The sausage was good but nothing out of this world.  The warm cranberry was great, I usually hate cranberries, you know the one that you get on Thanksgiving in the mold of a can.  Bottom Line: Come here for the beer and the atmosphere.  The band in their lederhosen was fun, especially when they ask for crowd participation.",

    "text": "We reserved a table for our group of about 12. Group was all guys that had known each other since high school, plus a few that served together in Iraq. We though the plan was to meet for dinner. We had split up into smaller groups since we all wanted to do different things during the day. Well, a lot of the other groups decided they would eat first and just show up for drinks. Wish he had thought of that.  Beer was good, but expensive. My favorite was the seasonal winter ale. We had a lot of fun being loud, getting paddled by the shot girl, etc. However, no one else there was being loud or anything. The place was packed, but every other group was pretty subdued. The band was OK. I don't know much about German music so maybe they were more authentic or whatever, but their music didn't seem to get people going as much some bands I've seen at local Octoberfest events.  The place is what you and your friends make of it. We had fun and I would have given it a higher rating if the food and service had been better. I split a sausage platter with a friend. It was around $20 and we got 3 sausages. One tasted like an Oscar Meyer weiner. We also shared an obatzer which was really good, but only came with one pretzel which was way too little for the giant lump of cheese. We ordered another pretzel, but it never came. Supposedly there is a pretzel girl sometimes; she wasn't there when we were there. We were both still hungry when we left. Some others in the group got burgers. They we huge. Man vs. Food huge. However, they said they weren't that good.  Service was mixed. Shot girl and souvenir girl were cool and basically hung out at our table since we were the only people buying stuff from them. When you get a shot, the girl paddles you. We saw one other person get paddled while we were there. Most of our group got a shot and several got two. Our actual server seemed like she wasn't happy to have the \"rowdy\" table. She just kind of stood there.",

    "text": "Exact replica of the Hofbrauhaus in Munchen! Except that the outdoor beer garden is not really outdoor. I need to dig out my pictures from Germany because it was so similar, I felt like I was teleported back in time to one of my fun trips through Europe.   My co-worker and I were transported back and forth past this place on the way to the Convention Center and when it was time to eat, we agreed to check this place out. It's diagonal from Hard Rock and huge - hard to miss.   In the front there is a cute gift shop w/ cheesy souvenirs like beergarden girl aprons and the huge steins w/ the Hofbrauhaus logo. We were greeted by a friendly German man who smiled and asked if we'd like to be seated next to some good-looking men. Haha - the tables are large and you will sit (if you're in a small party) with other parties. Unfortunately, no one was there (men anywhere near our age) so we were seated next to a grandma w/ her teenage granddaughter who was apparently applying for a job. The band was playing in their leiderhausen, beers in hand. Great atmosphere.  We started with a jumbo Oktoberfest pretzel that came with a tasty spread on the side, and mustard. Great starter! I'm not a huge beer fan, but had to get one to be in the mood. It came in a big ol' mug - it was their version of hefeweizen. I wasn't lovin' it, but I drank it anyway.  For my meal I ordered the Majoram - veal bratwurst and it came with red cabbage and mashed potatoes. I had to get some spaetzle on the side, but it was flavorless and disappointing. The red cabbage, which I didn't really want, was good. The bratwurst, also good. We also got sauerkraut and that was good as well and served warm. My coworker got this inappropriately large sausage sandwich - the HB Riesenbratwurst. We had to take pics b/c it was so long and huge. Hilarious. She was hammin' it up.  No room for dessert, but my coworker had to have some German schnapps - completely different from American schnapps. I was blown away by how potent the pear one was, but the apple was good. And strong.  By the end of the night we were stuffed. I don't recommend this for dinner before going clubbing. Better for the day of your flight home so you can waddle around and sit.",

Speaking of chicken, we had the chicken sausage with sauerkraut and mashed potatoes -- they were really good (especially after 2 liters of Hefe!!).

There's an indoor (you wouldn't want to be outside) beer garden in the back part which is quieter and good for conversation.  At the front is the large open beer hall where the oompa bands play and there's guest contests and singalongs.  (Yah, seems silly at first but after a couple beers...).  It can get pretty loud in there.  Only complaint (and has little to do with the establishment, I think?)  is that sometimes it can get a bit too rowdy with some of the guests - we've seen fights happen a couple times we've been there.  So sad people can't just have fun.",

A friend we went to Vegas with saw this place as we were driving around and begged us to stop since she loved the one she had been to in Germany.   The place looks very authentic, from the decor to the costumes the servers have to wear. There was a band playing that was good from what I could tell, but they were singing in either Austrian or German, or both.   I ordered 34oz. beer, I forget which one but my friend squealed with excitement to know they carried it. For dinner I ordered the hamburger (mix of pork and beef). It was pretty tasty, the fries were awesome and it was decently priced.   Everyone else ordered more authentic meals and seemed pleased. Those plate prices were much higher than my hamburger, and then with all the beers the bill was very high.   Our server was great and very happy. I don't know why but they spank people, some tradition I'm guessing but I think after having half of my beer I wasn't really paying attention. They smacked (honestly a good hard smack) one of the guys at the table with a paddle on his rear end and everyone in the whole place cheered.  The only reason I don't give it a 4 is because, like I said before, I'm just not a fan of German food so I don't think I'll be eating there again anytime soon.",

When the waitress talked to the group, she was loud enough for us to hear, even over the band! That's one hell of a feat, but she played back and forth with them and they were loving it. When she brought the shots she brought them to our table and tried to spank them on our table cause there was a giant pole in the way. One of the guys grabbed her and she smacked his hand away and he got in her face. She tried to make the situation better. Giving them different options on where to get spanked but he was so mad she pushed him off he just screamed in her face. I was in the service industry for four years and how she dealt with those assholes was nothing but professional. She offered to give them to another waitress and whisked away. The other guys in the group giving him shit for ruining their night. The manager came over and I didn't catch everything but I know they were lying. After they left I called the server over, I can't remember her name it was different. I talked to her about it and asked to speak with her manager. A guy manger came over, the woman had already left. He seemed disinterested in what I had to say but he wasn't the manager who took care of it. Beer was delicious but I wouldn't want my gf to work here so I probably won't be coming back.",

You can even buy lederhosen is the gift shop!!! Las Vegas has captured the ribald spirit of the place - steins held high, singing along with the zesty band pumping out tunes to fill the cavernous space. And of course the spanking!!! If you have to ask then you need to just GO!   You'll find old world favorites such as sauerbraten; an oven-roasted pork shank with red apple kraut; Bavarian sausage loaf, and a marinated sausage salad. Our appetizer was the Kartoffelpuffer - a trio of crisp-edged, thick yet fluffy potato pancakes, offered with a small crock of applesauce and a side of sour cream. I ordered Jagerschnitzel (a fun word to say) - a savory large pork cutlet covered in a blanket of creamy mushroom sauce. It was paired with delicious spaetzle.  My friend had the Hofbrauhaus Wurstplatte (a sausage sampler served with sauerkraut, mashed potatoes and German mustard) and proclaimed it to be very good. Overall, I have had much better german food elsewhere. This was not as authentic and ultimately didn't seem made with care but mass produced.",

    "text": "For those of you who follow my reviews, you'll know that I love to seek out German/Bavarian restaurants in whatever city I'm in. Everything came together nicely during this visit, my first, to the Hofbrauhaus.  I had seen it on Yelp as I was mapping out places to visit prior to my trip to Vegas, and the reviews and pictures were very eye-opening. I'm a sucker for German style food and accommodations. This place didn't disappoint.  Also, I was staying across the street at the Hard Rock Resort and Casino, so it was a no-brainer. I knew I wanted to work this place in, and so it was done.  The interior is very well done. They took a lot of pride in constructing and decorating the inside to make you feel as if you were in a German biergarten. They played authentic German music, too. Also, the servers are dressed in appropriate traditional outfits. They also have a biergarten with wooden picnic tables throughout.  The food was good. I had a pretzel to begin with, followed by a wurst platter, and topped off with Applestrudel. I enjoyed a couple of wheat beers, which were perfectly chilled. See attached pics for further details.  The service was on target. My server was knowledgeable, and took the time to explain my options, as well as the type of beer that would complement my meal.  Would love to take this place home to South Florida with me. However, it's too big to fit into my suitcase. I strongly recommend checking the place out whether you're staying at the nearby off-the-strip hotels, or seeking this place out as an alternative to all of the places to eat at on the strip.",

The food was authentic and tasted very similar to the Hofbrauhaus in Munich, Germany that we visited last summer.  The food and beer are very good and are worth it for a special treat once in awhile.  If I lived in the area, I might go and have a beer and pretzel once in awhile, too.",

My father in law mentioned this fun place so we gave it a go of which I'm glad  The place feels authentic, although I couldn't say for sure as I've never been to Austria.   As you walk in you have a cute gift shop, then you enter the \"hall\" with long tables and a band playing traditional music while dressed the part. At one point a huge horn went around that the player had to stand on tables to play! The girls were dressed skimpily but I suppose the part, what was interesting was the wood paddle that made its way to three gents behinds while we were there. RIGHT PADDLING   In any case, my schnitzel was amazing! The sauce had great flavor and the breast was very moist and breaded just enough. Otherwise the other meals weren't good. I forget what hubby got but it didn't have much flavor, the in laws Chicken looked good but was very dry.  Beer was nothing special, I'm spoiled by the craft these days I suppose   Lastly the place is pricy and the meals small, given our appetite we were hungry a couple hours later",

    "text": "I came here for my birthday after friends had recommended it for a family-friendly lunch spot a little outside of the strip. I was not informed that Hofbrauhaus celebrates birthdays differently than other restaurants. I was offered a shot of alcohol, which I initially declined, but after the waiter persisted and wouldn't let me say no, I accepted to take the drink. He then told me before I could try it, I had to pose with him at the next table over. I thought it was for a picture...but instead, the waiter put his hand on my back and pressed me to the table and I was slapped so hard with a wooden paddle (three times) that it echoed throughout the restaurant and I had visibly red welts on my ass (because I was wearing shorts at the time) for several days later.   Initially I thought it was a joke, and so did my family and friends who were with me, but shortly after this incident the police and medical help were called because I couldn't sit down and was in incessant pain. I got an x-ray when I went to the hospital and it showed a very deep contusion to my tailbone. It's been several months since and I still can't sit down without a tailbone pillow and regular pain meds every single day.  Any other restaurant would have compensated the food, as we left mid-way through our meal when this happened because I was in so much pain. But no, the police that I'd called to report this incident told us that if we didn't pay (for the food we didn't eat and the beer we didn't drink) we'd be arrested for not paying our bill. So not only did we have to pay for everything, the drink that caused this WAS NOT COMPLIMENTARY, but the restaurant owner and waiter said this was done all in good fun. Hitting someone so hard they buckle at the knees and can't stop crying isn't in good fun.   I was never informed that I was going to be hit. I never consented to being hit. I never thought celebrating my birthday could be turned into such a bad experience. This completely ruined my trip to Vegas because I was in so much pain and couldn't properly sit down for several weeks after. I would not recommend this sad excuse for a restaurant. The service is poor, the staff's behavior is crass and dangerous, and at least at the strip clubs you have to ask before you touch a woman (much less try to hit her).",

    "text": "Omg.  It was a joke!! We came here because their menu (on open table) had some vegan dishes- a rare it's for German restaurants.  So we were super excited! The look of the place was very authentic and cool with live music.  The menu had something called \"bread dumpling\" I asked the Mexican waiter what it was and he said \"bread dumpling\".  That was all he could tell me about it.  So I ordered the vegan schnitzel and my husband the vegan weiner with curry sauce.  What I received was a F...ing Morning Star chicken patty!!! Yes pre packed and yuck! For $20.  Wtf? My husband stands was a cheap pre packed bright orange vegan weiner wit curry ketchup on it.  Also $20.  We wanted to order a six shot board of apple schnapps- the waiter did not want to get it for us and didn't understand why we wanted 6- though the menu clearly states you can order a board of 6 or 12 and made it sound really cool.  When it came the waitress made us take the shots off the paddle then spanked my husband 3 times (one time for each shot) with the paddle. The first 2 were cute and fun- the musicians were going along with it and everyone cheering.  The third wack she went totally physco (I have it on video the face change and everything) and hit him extremely hard!  Not exaggerating - he had a 6 inch BLACK bruise on his ass for over a month.  That is not cool.  I'd post a pic but I'm not sure it's allowed.",

They keep your beers full and make sure you have a good time. Everyone ordered something different in our party of 10 and everyone loved their food. I had the pretzel with the various dipping sauces and I would get that every time. Even the desserts were good. Get yourself a meat platter and a liter of beer and you will be happy.  If it's your birthday (maybe other celebrations too?) they give you a shot and a spanking--quite a sight to see. It's loud, so be warned.

The food menu is pretty extensive, and also surprisingly expensive given it's mostly variations of sausage, kraut, and mashed potatoes. The beer menu is simple with just a few varieties on tap. Three sizes - huge, 1/2 liter, and 10 oz.   I had a 10 oz original beer with a pork sausage plate. The beer was acceptable for a lager. For $16 you get three sausages, kraut, potatoes and gravy. Good taste for sure, but not enough to justify the price.   This place is huge, with lots of picnic table like seating. Again, I was the first person in the place and while the hall was still wide open, they started seating other people right next to me at my table. I get that if you are busy, but it seems unnecessary when not busy.   Novel place, so recommend a one time visit just to say you've been there.",

    "text": "We stayed near the strip for my husband's birthday so I wanted to go to a place we wouldn't normally go to. I chose about 3 to 4 possibilities. My husband liked the idea of eating at Hofbrauhaus so we decided to give it a try even though I knew this place is better for big groups. We walked in to people on the table with their beer in hand singing their hearts out! I thought \"Oh cool!\" . I was secretly glad the hostess led us to the quieter beer garden though. I just wanted a semi peaceful evening!  It was a nice size space and it looked like we were sitting outside. The ceiling was painted with a beautiful blue sky and there were cute  lanterns hovering around us.  They also have freelance photographers who walk around offering to take souvenir photos of you . We bought one since we were celebrating Jon's birthday.  If sentimental gestures are not your thing they have shot girls who will give you shots while smacking your bottom with a wooden paddle!  Some of the ladies really get into it they kind of do a three step jog then swing! We were fine just watching. It was pretty entertaining to watch while you wait for your food.  The food comes out really quick so there isn't really a wait time. I was pleasantly  surprised because the place was packed. We started off with the Creamy Bavarian Potato soup. It was too salty for me so I just had a couple of spoons of it. We also ordered the Jumbo Complete which was a big pretzel served with \"Obatzer\" cheese, sweet mustard and onion mustard. The sweet mustard was my favorite! The pretzel was also too salty for me so I just tried to avoid eating the outside of the pretzel. I had the Schnitzel Wiener Art for my main entree . It is a breaded pork cutlet that is served with Bavarian potato salad and cranberry sauce. It looked like a big chicken patty. The taste was okay but I think I would have liked it better if I dipped it in the mustard rather than the cranberry sauce. The potato salad I was expecting to taste amazing because they specialize in this type of cuisine but it was unremarkable. The strudel is amazing here though! It was so soft and tasted wonderful!   This is a nice place to go out with friends and have a few beers. I would go back again but I would order different items off the menu. I would keep my dessert the same though!",

    "text": "We came in on a wednesday afternoon and wanted to get some beers and snacks. I was surprised that they only had three beers, but I guess that's just the Hofbrauhaus way.  I had wanted to try a range of German beers, but three was what we had to choose from.  The wheat was probably the best, but nothing to come back for.  We got this great food sampler the server recommended for us. Two pretzels, two mustards, tons fo sauerkraut, and maybe 5 or 6 different sausages. The pretzels did not taste super fresh, but were quite good.  The sausages were amazing.  All in all, I don't feel a need to return, which is a shame, but it was a fun experience and I would recommend trying it if you haven't.",

I'd rather have a Sabrett.  Service 2/5 Host when you walk in was not friendly.  Our waitress was friendly to a degree.   Ambiance: 3/5 - Good German vibe.  Live music.   Group seating in main dining area may scare you away.    Seats in the garden are SUPER uncomfortable.  The rear digs into your back.  Cleanliness 3/5 No major issues but not spotless either.  Restrooms: n/a Didn't Visit  Parking: n/a Didn't use.  Walked.  Overall 2/5 If you want to go drinking this is a decent place probably.  For food there are much richer experiences to be had in Vegas.  UPDATE: 10/31/2015 - The director of operations contacted me privately about this review concerned..  This is a good sign.  As a result I've raised the rating from 1 stars to 2.",

A trip here without trying one of their beers would be a cryin' shame. Another must, is the gigantic pretzel.I have been here several times and everything I have had, has been great. Also look in the local/tourist magazines for a coupon for a free beer, that's right kiddies, I said free beer, this isn't Sheboygan, this is Las Vegas, Nevada, the most exciting city on the planet. So for a night step off the strip and join the boisterous fun, don't for get the free beer coupon! Live It Up You Are In Las Vegas For Cryin' Out Loud!",

The service is a bit absent, the bands tend to be lively and entertaining.  But SOMETHING has to be done about all the damn SPANKING going on here!    The waitresses walk around serving flights of drinks on these paddles, and I don't know what the hell the customers keep doing but they keep getting beaten in the ass!  While all their friends take pictures and videos!  Everyone around adds insult to injury and claps as though they saw the offense and agree with the punishment!  I'm always hesitant to return for fear they've graduated to hanging!  Last year I was walking in and saw an older German couple -- dressed German to the nines -- storming out muttering \"unglaublich\" under their breath.  And it is absolutely unbelievable.  This is the Hofbrauhaus, but it's in Vegas.  So you get a little Hofbrauhaus, and you also get a little ... shudder ... Vegas.",

The tables were like a beer hall too- large and shared by many different parties. The only reason I didn't give it more stars was the noise and partying that was abundant. The food was really good and it was a fun place. Not everyone's cup of tea but I'll be back.",

Both of our families have German families so I was excited to see what sort of place it was. We were seated shortly before we were expected (we had a reservation for 8 PM) and were seated in the dining hall. It was incredibly loud! At the end you fill out a survey and it asked if the music was too loud and I had to say that the crowd was too loud. Maybe it was just the time of night. The music that I did hear was not German (lots of recognizable party songs) and the entertainment was amusing.  My food was delicious! We split potato pancakes (Kartoffelpuffer) with salmon. I got the pork schnitzel and a side of spaetzle (my favorite holiday meal!). I wish that there had been a selecion of German wine but I did not see any on the menu. I spent more than I was expecting but it did taste good. I would take my family here and I think they'd enjoy it.  With a drink, half an app, and the entree I got (from the special) I paid ~$50 before tip.",

The place was off the strip but not too far away. They had free valet parking out front of the cool looking building. We had a reservation that we made on Yelp and were seated in about 30 seconds. Once inside the dining hall it was a little loud at first. There was a band playing Oompah music but there were in the midst of the \"raise your glass\" chant. We were seated at the traditional long wooden tables with benches. Comfortable enough. Our waitress was over quickly to take our drink orders. BEER! I had the original in a giant glass mug. It was perfect.  After a few mins we had figured out what we wanted from the decent sized menu. I had saurbraten that was awesome. My wife has the sampler with several different types of sausage and a pretzel. The food was delicious and went well with the beer. The band played the whole time and would occasionally get a little loud. It was all fun though. At one point the singer grabbed an Alpine Horn and went around playing that on each table in the place looking for tips. We gladly obliged. It was also quite funny to see some other ladies walking around with a large wooden paddle. Guys were lining up to get spanked. It wasn't super dirty or anything, which would have been bad because we had some kids with us. They all laughed at it and had a good time coloring and enjoying their kids dishes.  After the dinner we made a trip through the gift shop and picked up a few things including a small boot shot glass. :)  Can't wait to see the original in Germany! PROST!",

As for the food, I would give them 3 stars. HB does have an extremely vast variety of different sausages and brats, however I like my brats to have a char on the outside for some crunch. Even though I asked for my sausages to be grilled... there were no grill marks to be seen, and the outside didn't have any hint of a crust.   Another huge flaw in my book is that their pretzels weren't warm! Cold pretzels are hard and chewy! If they had just toasted them a bit, it would have made a world of difference.   However, I feel overall that this is a great fun place to hang out with friends and drink a belly-bursting amount of beer. But foodwise, HB fell a little short for me.",

    "text": "After looking all over town to find a place that was reasonably priced for our wedding reception we came here! Best idea we have ever had. The staff and music were great attentive and made us feel very welcome. We got to perform on stage with the band and it was a lot of fun. Although busy due to it being VERY busy on a Saturday night, our table was attended to very promptly. Even the other patrons were nice and gave us great well wishes. Can't wait for our next visit. My wife ABSOLUTELY LOVED the salt and pepper shakers we got here. They are her personal favorite. Beer wasn't really cheap but was VERY worth the price in size and quality. Thank you very much for the best wedding reception I could ever ask for!",

    "text": "Food was quite good, nice sausages, killer potato soup (definitely order this if you're looking for a good meal, the potato soup alone is worth schlepping over from the strip to this place).   Nice waitstaff, but 'service' is abnormally slow, even at off-peak hours. We watched one waitress flirt nearly continuously with a single table of patrons, as two other waitresses managed multiple tables (one appeared to have a majority of them and was doing the best she could while the other two were focused on some tables with heavy, heavy drinking going on).   Basically it looked like the more you drink, the more attention you'll get from the waitstaff. Which I suppose makes sense, as that's where they're going to make most of their money as the booze aint cheap.   Noisy as well.   I've also been one previous time and have seen the house band. If you want a (relatively) quiet dinner while they're playing, you'll need to go to the beer garden. If you want to get rip roaringly drunk and don't care about making an &ss out of yourself in public, then go for the main room and try to get there when the band is playing. Their schedule is on the website.",

    "text": "Is there better pre-going-out food than sausage, spaetzle, mashed potatoes and sweet cabbage?  The answer, young padawan...is no. No, there is not.  I visited HBLV post-Ghost Bar Day Club and pre-heading out for the night. Best decision of our trip.  Definitely recommend the veal bratwurst and cabbage plate (Majoram Plate).  Beer was tasty, cold, and large and we were able to purchase a paddling along with a shot for the gentlemen in our group, which was definitely entertaining.    Fun, unpretentious atmosphere and super tasty eats.  Ideal if you're staying at the Hard Rock, as it's right across the street.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here on 3/12/12 for dinner and drinks!   As we were walking up to the place I heard live music, so I already knew it was going to be a good time. It's a huge white building with lit blue neon lights when it's dinner time. Once we got in I noticed a full bar and gift shop. We were seated quickly in what was like a Hogwarts type dinning hall, at least in my buzzed opinion. The ceilings are high and the tables and chairs are made of pure wood. They also have a stage set up for the music!   Straight up Yelp, I had a 5 star time with 3 star food.   The night we came there was a great crowd. The place was jamming, food was being served every minute, and people were taking shots of Jagermeister before getting spanked with a wooden paddle, hard.   Before we ordered our food we started with a 2 Liter boot of Hefeweizen each. These were pretty fun and definitely pack a punch. I can't remember exactly what my meal was called but it was 2 grilled veal sausages, a little lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pretzel with dipping sauce. The sausages were good but just didn't taste or look grilled. My pretzel could have been a bit warmer as well. The food was not horrible, just missing something.   I had a great time here. I will be back for another boot and to try more items off the menu.",

There is live music and you sit at long tables and it has a fun slightly rowdy vibe.  There are Jager girls that come around and sell Jager shots for $5.  In order to get your shot, you have to get paddled, and these girls don't hold back.  They hit hard!  Lifted one guys bum right up over the table.  the best part is they take commerative photos capturing your expression when the board hits your bum.  It's a fun place to go once but not some place I feel the need to go every time I got to Vegas.",

I had the jagerschnitzel which wasn't bad, but it definitely needed salt. The rest of the group seemed pleased with their meals of bratwurst and roasted chicken legs. The bachelor in our group got a good paddling from our waitress, as did many lads that night as the spanks were heard echoing 'round the great hall.  This was the perfect choice to help our friends celebrate their impending nuptials - I would definitely return to the Hofbrauhaus again!",

    "text": "I really tried to like this place.  I met some friends in Vegas and I suggested trying this place instead of the nearby Fulton fish place in the New York casino, which is one of my favorites.  My relatives used to make familiar Austrian dishes so it sounded like a good place to try. Since I had never been there before I asked about the menu.  Although the server Erika was superficially friendly she did not answer my questions about portion size (I wanted grossen) and did not suggest anything or care that much. The lunch menu (with better prices) are only M-F which also kind of rubbed me wrong. The atmosphere and decor is nice although Sunday afternoon was very tame.  The prices are all high -- for what you get.  For a $14 plate, I basically had three small frankfurters and some potato salad.  It had good flavor and all but was really light.  These were the same frankfurters you find at any German deli .  The drinking water served was good and almost tasted like mineral water but maybe since I was parched it could have been simple tap water.  Since things kicked off on the wrong foot I opted out of anything else to drink (overpriced) although the beer looked good. My friends had young kids and there was a piece of hair in the macaroni & cheese.  Also, I tasted the fries they had and it was almost identical to McDonald's and might have been for all I knew.  Also, upon leaving they noticed that there were a basket of crayon packs for the kids (to keep them busy) that they never got nor was suggested. The place is clean, seats are wooden and not comfortable really, and there was a bathroom attendant too.  I don't really care for bathroom valets or attendants anyway so that was a minus as well. They did not push the gift shop but they asked if I wanted a picture taken and I told the woman that I had my own camera -- no thank you. Service was not really fast but not extremely long either. I might come back someday but only for lunch -- maybe.",
