While the atmosphere is amazing, the food is even better. We had brunch here with the all you can drink mimosas. My partner got the quiche, my kids got grilled cheese, and I got the grits dish. OMG! This is some of the best brunch food I've ever had. Which for Vegas to have such divine food off the strip at a reasonable price is amazing. We all enjoyed our meals and service. They do weddings and receptions to top it off. Bonus... Wine tasting on Saturdays. This place is a must. You won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "My wife and I had a romantic dinner at Marche Bacchus.  We enjoyed our time very much and the food and service were basically good.  Reservations for the patio help.  So why only three stars?  Value.  The food was good but not outstanding.  Caesar's Salad: Take it--very good but an expected rendition.  Steak Tartare:  Leave it--enjoyable, but the meat had tough spots and the quantity of capers overpower the mild beef.  The meat was too mild to hold up to the overwhelming capers.  Even the poached egg yoke and buttered toast was overpowered the meat.  The salted shallots to the side was the right compliment to the tartar.  Maple Leaf Duck:  Leave it--There were tough veins in the duck but tender portions, too.  It was cooked perfectly.  Yet, it didn't really have flavors that enticed my taste buds.  The quince was a nice touch but didn't enhance the game.  The other side flavors were non descript.  Roasted Chicken:  Take it--clearly the best dish we tried here.  Chicken sounds boring but it was much better than the duck.  The seasoning was subtle but done well.  The Spaetzle was enhanced with an herb reduction, which is more German than French, but who cares because it had an abundance of flavors that complimented the chicken.  We both thought this dish was extremely well executed.  Sides:  we only ordered the Mac and Cheese.  I hate mac and cheese but with the Gruyere (a type of Swiss cheese) they put in it, it was excellent (it has black truffles, too, but there is no way truffle is going to sneak through the Gruyere).  The cream of this side overpowered the duck but who cares, it was good.  Just don't order the duck.  Wine:  selecting a bottle of the wine in the store and then drinking it at the table was a novelty.  However, the prices are well over retail and the descriptions are a bit deceptive at times.  Look at the review next to the wine and it might have a 90+ rating.  Yet compare the vintage and it will be several years off.  Not honest in the wine world yet it can be informative.  Of course, then you add another $10 to open it at your table.  Fortunately, they offer wines as low as $15 so $25 for a bottle is affordable.  Service: we got excellent service and the fact that the waiter spoke with a French accent only made the night more romantic.  Ambiance:  who would of thought that Tom Petty music could be romantic?  Well, the way the musician of the evening sung, he is.  And all the other great 80's music as well.  The live music was enjoyable but the uniqueness of dining on the water, with the moon dangling just under the patio, this is what one comes to Marche Bacchus for.  Don't bring a generic gift card; they won't be able to get it to work.  And if you bring some special discount, they'll add gratuitiy immediately.  I don't think there really is such a thing as gratuity here; there is always a reason to require it so really there will always be a standard service charge of 18%.  So okay, it's a very high 3 stars, 5 if you only consider romance of it all but 3 if you consider the culinary aspect.",

    "text": "What an absolute thrill it was to be at Marche Bacchus for Valentine's Dinner last evening, with the estimable Iron Chef Alex Stratta (formerly of Alex, Stratta and Renoir) helming the kitchen. The restaurant is a favorite of ours, but last night they outdid themselves.   The butternut squash soup with accents of duck confit was dense, flavorful, and just the right portion to whet the appetite without squelching it. The winter vegetable salad combined crunchy root vegetables, creamy burrata and tangy balsamic dressing to harmonious effect. The main course - we both had the sea bass - was incredible. The fish was seared to a delicate crunch on the outside, while remaining succulent and almost impossibly flavorful on the inside. Dessert (to share) was a bowl of berries atop a dollop of mascarpone, and was a sublime way to finish the meal.   We were there towards the end of the evening, when everyone must have been frazzled, but the service was unfailingly polite and attentive. And the fact that the restaurant pulled off such a delectable meal on one of the busiest nights of the year speaks volumes.  That being said, what could Marche Bacchus do better? If anything, the service level doesn't always reach the amazingly high standards set by the kitchen. Management is aware of this; the owners are always on the floor and very responsive. I've never met restaurateurs more committed to getting it right, and I'm quite confident they will do so.  In the meantime, Chef Stratta will be in the kitchen until he finds a permanent replacement for recently-departed executive chef Dave Middleton. Being able to enjoy Stratta's cuisine while taking in Marche Bacchus' beautiful lakeside ambiance and enviable wine selection is really quite something. Hop on it!",

    "text": "I've been a loyal supporter of Marche Bacchus over the past 10 years. But I was recently taken aback and felt mistreated by the owner on a recent visit. I had a luncheon with my staff of about 10 people and was greeted by the host very pleasantly sat us outside on the patio. It was a hot day in Las Vegas 105of-110of. The misters were on with overhead fans and initially I thought that it may be better and cooler to sit inside. The host said of course he can seat us inside but also suggested adding an additional large standalone fan, which was near us but facing the upper deck patio. So we said ok. Later the waiter came over and started taking orders for drinks and we mentioned the additional fan. So he went over and proceeded to maneuver the fan. The owner stepped over and softly said 'leave it, they'll be ok'.  I was quite surprised and taken aback. Almost said something but decided not to. Later on about 15 minutes into our meal I noticed that the owner had a small party of 4 that he joined and had lunch with. And guess what, the fan was pointed right there toward his table.  Anyway about the meal. The mussels were not that great per one of my guests. The Nicoise salad was unbalanced for some reason. It had about 20 whole olives, which I thought was excessive. Overall they still do a very good job with the food. However given this lack of concern for the guest this was my last visit. A restaurant isn't only about the food. It's an experience, should be warm and inviting.",

    "text": "Horrible experience here today. We came here only to use a Groupon that had expired (under Groupon's terms, the amount you paid for the Groupon never expires, so we should have been able to apply the $69 I originally spent on it towards a purchase). The Groupon was originally for brunch, but when I called, the hostess told me I could only apply it towards their currently offered Groupon, which is a lunch. Odd, but fine, we were excited about checking it out, so we made reservations. We show up, and I explain the situation to our waiter, who brought my husband and I the limited Groupon menu (our friend ordered off the regular menu). With the Groupon, my husband and I were supposed to choose an appetizer or dessert, entree, and house glass of wine. So, this is what we did, and our friend and daughter had items from the regular menu.  It comes time to pay the bill, and our waiter says we need to wait for the manager, who is en route, as the owner will not deal with it. So, we sit around an extra 15 minutes waiting for this person (not an easy feat with a 1 1/2 year-old). He arrives, and tells us we cannot use the Groupon today-the owner is refusing, saying that the original Groupon was for brunch, so it has to be used for brunch. I explain that the hostess told us the exact opposite when we spoke on the phone, and then upon arrival it was explained to us again by the staff that we had to order off the abbreviated menu in order to be able to use any of the value on our Groupon. I took our daughter outside, and our friend finally just asked for the entire bill. He basically had to yell at the owner to get him to finally apply the original $69 to our bill-and we still got screwed over. Once home, we compared the grouped prices they'd charged us for the \"deal\" that they gave us (bundling the wine, entree, and appetizer together) against the cost of each item individually, and somehow the prices on our bill were more expensive than if we'd just bought everything separately anyways. I've never been to a restaurant where the owner cared less about pleasing his customers. As if poor customer service was not reason enough to never come back here, the food was very mediocre-the bread for the sandwiches looked and tasted like something you'd find in a cheap cafeteria. In the retail wine section, we saw bottles of wine that were marked up to over twice the price we've seen in other stores. I love supporting local businesses, but not one like this. It's clear this place had its heyday as a Vegas staple years ago, and is on its way out.",

The service was awful and had it not been for us asking for water, or bread, or where our cheese plate was, or when our entrees were coming, we would have gone completely ignored.  All the while, a couple who obviously knew the manager due to the way they interacted upon entering the restaurant, was immediately seated, received their food 20 minutes prior to us (same dish), and were waited on hand and foot.  This place used to be good.  I had been a few times when a different chef was in charge and it was superb.  Now, I'm not sure what happened.  Sure the atmosphere is top-notch, but with such dreadful service, and mediocre food, atmosphere will only go so far.

Also, this is a great restaurant for a romantic lunch/dinner. It is situated overlooking one of the manmade lakes in Desert Shores. Be ready for the $$-$$$. It's well worth the money",

We ordered our food and did not get served our entrees until 50 minutes later or longer. The outdoor patio was the focus and the folks inside in the dining area, not so much. I was visiting Vegas with a good friend. We decided to look for a resturant off the Vegas strip. Researched thoroughly, thought this one was going to be great. From the moment we arrived, it was clear it was not going to be great. The hostess even greeted us with negativity and just was not friendly or nice. Food was ok but not great. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "My go-to spot.  I have been coming to Marche Bacchus since before they even served dinner; when it was first and foremost a wine shop run by Gregoire.  When they expanded, I worried they would lose focus on bringing in fantastic Burgundies (which, btw, this place the BEST selection of in town).  Instead, they eased my fears and executed a simple menu that you could enjoy with the wines they sold.    As the menu grew and ownership changed, the operation did nothing but improve.  Sure, I could nitpick about things I'd like to see or change on the menu, but that would be counter-productive, as they are always making tweaks.  Portions are huge, prices reasonable.    My most recent visit was for lunch, and we had French Onion Soup (great flavor, though I would have loved more cheese), escargot (mmmm), lobster croissant (huge and filled with lots of lobster meat), poulet frites (fork tender and really juicy) and a ham & brie sandwich (really just ham and cheese, but good and tasty, nonetheless).  For desert, we had an enormous serving of lemon bar.  It was HUGE and more than enough for three people.  I absolutely LOVE the fact that you can buy any wine in the place and have it with your meal for $10 (and they'll also allow you to bring wines from your own collection, as well).  It makes it almost irresistible for me to suppress my inner wine geek.    Wine with food?  This is my go-to spot.",

    "text": "I have spent the last 14 years in the Las Vegas restaurant industry and have been to countless restaurants on the Strip, Downtown, in Summerlin, Henderson and Boulder City. I love fine dining but don't consider myself a 'foodie' or food snob ... it's just something that I enjoy. I have heard from a coworker as well as a couple of customers about how awesome this place is. Among the accolades were the food, the incredible wine selection in the on-site wine store and that it feels like you've actually left town when you dine there.  Last week, I finally took the time to make the trip and found it peacefully tucked away in an adorable little Summerlin community. Upon parking and approaching the building, I immediately thought that I might be in the wrong place. It is in a strip plaza and from the outside, does not appear to be a restaurant and seems too small to accommodate many diners. The front doors slid open and we were very warmly welcomed by a hostess who asked us if we were dining with them this evening. We stated that we were indeed and offered our last name for the reservation, I in turn asked for her name. She smiled and introduced herself as Tracy. She was aware that it was our initial visit to the establishment (we booked through Open Table which relays that we were first time diners) and explained how things work. You can either enjoy wine by the glass, which allows the opportunity for variety or you can choose bottles from the store and take them to your table to be served to you before, during and after your meal. If the latter is your choice, there is a $10 corking fee per bottle which is extremely reasonable. She then asked if we would like some time to peruse the store or if we preferred to be seated first. Since I had heard so much about the ambiance, I was eager to see the terrace and opted to be seated directly. She promptly collected menus and asked if we preferred to dine inside or outside to which I almost too eagerly responded \"Definitely outside please\". She smiled and guided us through the store, pointed out a quaint cozy indoor dining room to the right and stated that if we were too hot or became uncomfortable for any reason outside, we could transfer indoors ... and finally out onto the terrace. As we walked through the door, I felt like I had stepped into a different world. The terrace is breathtaking! She showed us to a table overlooking the lake through open wall sized glass windows. My husband and I exchanged very pleased smiles. She informed us that Marty would be our waiter and would be right with us. [When we were enjoying our meal, she sat another couple near us and stopped by to check on us. I was very impressed by this as hostesses rarely interact with guests except upon arrival and departure. Nice touch!] Marty appeared almost instantly and offered our water selections, went over the soup du jour as well as the dinner specials. He is warm, personable, jovial, attentive and informative. We enjoyed his service very much. We each ordered a glass of wine while reviewing the menu. Once we had ordered our appetizer, we went inside to look over the bottle selection. The prices are very reasonable and the selection is quite impressive. We made our selection and returned to our table. Marty saw us return, smiled and came directly to our table to serve us our wine. We couldn't have been more pleased with the entire experience thus far. We began with a delightful cheese plate. My husband had the braised beef which was incredibly tender and perfectly flavorful. I ordered the fish du jour which was a wonderfully delicious snapper dish. For dessert my husband ordered the creme brulee and I ordered the tiramisu. Both were divine.  We stayed and selected a second bottle of wine while enjoying the live entertainment which we were told is provided on Wednesday and weekend evenings. The performer was a gentleman with a guitar who did a great job performing cover songs of easy listening music. Very enjoyable performance. When visiting restaurants, I always ask to speak to management prior to departing. I feel that every customer's input is important to the establishment and recommend that everyone do the same. A charming man with a lovely accent (Spanish?) quickly approached us and introduced himself as Angelo. I told him it was our first time there and wanted to share what a wonderful experience we had. He seemed genuinely grateful for my compliments and thanked us for coming. Everything that I had been told is absolutely True. The food is amazing, the wine store is awesome, the staff and service is fabulous and the view and ambiance are incredible! My husband and I dined in the evening and were lucky enough to watch the sunset over the lake which was beautiful!  If it were possible, I would give this place 10 stars! We will definitely be back!",

They changed their chef and booom, no good anymore. Because we love the ambiance so much, we still went and had their pate, french fries and their wonderful crispy baguette/brea that is the foundation of French food. Now they changed their pate, taste like the one at Vons, they do NOT have their crispy bread anymore, but a mushi bred like in any cheap restaurant. The American owners who bought from the French owners DO NOT UNDERSTAND what French food is. The ambiance is stil great, the service is amicable but the food remind me of Mary Calenders. Shame on you for not maintaining the quality of food we had when you took over.",

We arrived a little early, and was immediately greeted with friendly smiles and a welcoming atmosphere, the hostess had saved a romantic table for us, but as we were a little early, it was not ready yet. The place was pretty packed, which meant all the waiters were busy.  At this point the sweet hostess jumped forward to clean the table herself, our spot was right at the edge of the deck, so we had an amazingly gorgeous view.  The waiter was very nice and attentive, unfortunately they were out of foie gras and duck, so instead we ordered escargot as an appetizer, a veal chop for myself and filet mignon for my other.  The escargot was a little bland, although the garlic butter sauce was quite heavenly with some bread.  The veal was a little dry around the crust, but overall good, the gnocci and mushrooms it came with was tasty.  And his filet mignon was amazing, perfectly cooked, tender, with au gratin potatoes and asparagus.  Mmmm.....  Bread pudding for dessert, they use a rum based sauce instead of the typical whiskey, it made for a subtle, not overly sweet flavor that I decided I preferred.  Overall it made for a great night.",

Absolutely great wine store, but indifferent service and consistently mediocre food in the restaurant, IMO.  Last time there I had the lobster salad on a croissant that could have been from the Albertson's bakery (or it was just premade, and refrigerated so long that it was cold and stiff and had zero taste, like one from the supermarket.)    This time it was quiche, just about the size of a large beverage coaster and maybe 3/4\" high at the most. Just a couple of bites - mostly crust and barely any filling to savor.  Hate to say it, but if Alex Stratta approved this quiche, he should be embarrassed.  Wine pour was skimpy.  Generally ignored after food arrived, no refills on drinks til you flag someone down. (Lots of attention to the bigger tables though - bring a group if you come and maybe the experience is better?)  Bread was good, and the view is nice.    Next time, I'll save a lil extra money up, and head down to the hassle of the Strip for Bouchon instead of this place...",

My last visit was with the family on Thanksgiving lunch. The foie gras was calling. In this case, we brought 89 Rieussec for that. Perfect. Then on to their wine. A couple bottles of Chassagne Montrachet and more food. Their wine prices are the cost of the bottle plus $10. Why some people have complained about the wine prices is beyond me.

So glad I finally made the time to eat here and earn those 1,000 OT points.  This place is in the middle of nowhere strip mall in a residential neighborhood; drive slow and you won't miss it, or drive past it and you better not miss it the second time.  We made a reservation and were seated outside on the patio, facing the lake.  It was nice and comfortable on the warm September night.  Our waiter was friendly and polite.  And for the food:  - bread + butter: 5/5 - so freaking good.  I'm kind of a bread and butter snob, and the bread here gets my stamp of approval - foie gras appetizer: my first time trying this delicacy and it was pretty dang flavorful  - duck entree was so rich and delicious  Service was great! Would definitely return again!!",

There is a nice fireplace near the tables that keeps is warm in the patio area. The server was polite and mentioned the specials of the day. We ordered the steak tartar topped with quail egg for an appetizer which was very tasty. For the entree, I ordered the braised beef ravioli with cream sauce that tasted very good. My friend ordered the fish of the day, I honestly can't remember what type it was but she enjoyed it. For dessert we ordered the bread pudding topped with vanilla gelato topped with caramel sauce. I always enjoy bread pudding and this didn't disappoint.  I actually came here on December 12th before going to see the Nutcracker, it was a great dinner before the show, I recommend this place.",

    "text": "This place makes you forget you're in Vegas. I came here last Friday to celebrate a job achievement with my parents and lil one. The first thing that sold me was the fact that they offered escargot. It's weird and odd, but escargot brings back some happy childhood memories with the family and its only tied to celebrations so I thought it was very fitting for the occasion. Secondly, this place is less than 5 mins away from home so it was super convenient. It's secluded from the strip and from anyone who does't live in Desert Breeze. I only came upon it because I searched restaurants with escargot. This is one of the few who serve it in Vegas.  Reservations were not hard to make on such short notice and when we were seated the restaurant was pretty empty. Mind you it was only 6pm on a hot Vegas summer day. So, we arrive and the hostess/maybe bartender was not in rush to seat us but more keen on serving her bar guests first. She also used a measuring cup to measure out her wine? Uhm, in all the food establishments I've worked at and I've worked at a few fine dining places and a bunch of casual dining establishments, I've never seen anyone do this and in fact they would be scolded for doing this especially in plain sight of guests. So when she finally escorts us to our seats on the patio (always ask for the patio because the view is what sets the mood and the inside is just blah in my opinion) we get to enjoy the view of the little man made lake and enjoy the many misters they have going. It didn't feel hot at all.  Service. The server introduced himself and informed us that he is working with another team member which I always liked the idea of teams, that way nothing is missed. We get our drinks first then order 2 orders of their escargot. It was so delicious and worth the calories I gained. Being able to dip their warm, soft bread into their butter sauce...yum. Our server knew what she was doing when she left that last tray on our table and brought us more bread...sneaky server but I thank your for it. haha.  My dad got the Chilean Sea Bass - chef fish special, my mom ordered the Honey-spiced Duck, I got the Australian Wagyu (Hey, I'm a carnivore) and my daughter wanted the kids pasta in butter sauce. All the dishes were good and savory. Sea bass resembled a fried block of butter which was kind of intriguing. It was delicious but the presentation of it was just...different. The duck was very succulent and a bit tough so maybe next time my mom should order it med well rather than med. I had the wagyu and frites. Ok, the wagyu was juicy and yummy but THE FRITES is what I couldn't stop devouring. I was actually sad that some of them had been soaked by the steaks juices. For anyone who's grown up in Oahu, Hawaii and in the Kalihi district, they'll know why I have to make a big deal about these frites/french fries. Up until December 14, 2002 at 4 pm.this establishment served THE BEST teri burgers, ice cream slushies and FRENCH FRIES for 42 years!!!! So the fries/frites that were served with my steak were the exact same fries from my hometown. They're got that extra crispy texture to them that make them so good and crunchy that you cannot stop munching on them. In fact I forgot about my steak and demolished what little fries I had on my plate first. My poor steak was neglected till the next day when I had it as leftovers. The kids pasta was ok, nothing to spectacular but it is what it is.  Desserts...oh my god, I really don't know how we all managed to fit desserts into our bellies after all that food but we did. We order the trio of gelato, creme brulee and their chocolate lava cake. All were scrumptious and overly filling.   Servers were very attentive except for the water? I had to ask to fill our water up and that's all we were drinking...but they were nice and like I said attentive. Dishes were brought out in a timely matter and the presented very well. Oh and they also had a lady singing on the patio that night so that made the experience more enjoyable.",

The view we had was of the lake, we got to watch swans swim by and paddle boats. It didn't feel like Las Vegas at all!  I ordered the $20 endless Kir Royales to enjoy while we soaked in the beautiful setting. I ordered the Bacchus Omelet which was stuffed with goat cheese, spinach, tomato, mushrooms, ham, and braised leeks served with a side of breakfast potatoes. Everything was very tasty. The omelet was simple but all the flavors went well together. Overall a very pleasant and enjoyable brunching experience. My only critique was my bottomless drink sat empty for about five minutes.",

    "text": "Our favorite steakhouse was closed on Mondays, so we found Marche Bacchus nearby and was pleasantly surprised by the fabulous staff, location (on the water), and ambiance.  Great for romance, service, and fabulous views!  I ordered a filet which came with VERY limited portions of mashed potatoes, almost uncooked asparagus, and a strange mushroom all covered in a VERY salty red wine reduction.  I'm guessing the steak was 5-6 oz., but I went home hungry and ate a sandwich.   The steak ($39) was great, perfectly cooked, very tender and flavorful, just surprisingly small (they don't list the size on the menu).  The red wine reduction was so overly salty I scraped it off.  My wife had the chicken and had the same problem with too much salt in the sauce.  I might add that it's 4AM and I'm up with a case of heartburn from it writing this review. I can't say enough about the restaurant itself, it was great!  I can't say I'll order the steak again without asking for the sauce on the side so I can control the saltiness (I always thought the French didn't season the food before it gets to the table...).  So, you get half stars.  PLEASE FIX THIS, we want to come back often! We will definitely be back, this place is way too sweet to write off if I can fix it by changing how it's served.  (Suggestion: if you're going to serve a small filet for a big price, add some sides, and cook the asparagus... don't send me home hungry.)",

Brunch ended at 4pm which is terrific as most other places close an hour or two earlier than that on weekends.  We were seated pretty quickly and the entire restaurant sits out on the lake which is great for a nice meal with a view.  We began with complimentary, fresh bread and some unlimited mimosas.  We then had a lobster croissant and chicken and mushroom crepe for our meals.  Both were very good and surprisingly large in portion size.  I'd say the quality was a little below a strip brunch but quantity was a sticking point as I was thoroughly full after my meal.  Both dishes were good with no complaints.  The service was solid though there were times during the meal where we needed some more water, hot sauce, etc. where we had to track down the waiter to get served.  But they were really good about filling our mimosa glasses and even let us sit and sip after we paid.  Unlimited is truly unlimited at Marche.  Overall Marche is a solid brunch in a uniquely Summerlin area.  I would venture out of my way to come here for a meal and would even come back for a lunch or dinner, expecting a great meal once again.",

Today, I was with a party of six, one of them happen to be on crutches. When we made the reservations we told the host of this, and asked for a table on the upper level, but when we got there we were led to the stairs and sat on the lower level. When asked about this the reply was there is a person in a wheelchair, so only one handicapped person is allowed on the upper level at a time??  Our waiter did not introduce himself and was cold and not personable, we ordered coffees and I was given a cup that had a large crack running thru it, when I asked for another cup the waiter acted surprised that I did not want to drink from a cracked cup. My omelette was over cooked and lacked favor (there was no salt or pepper on the table) the mushroom, tomato goat cheese filling was like a second thought and was not integrated into the omelette, the breakfast potatoes (which I actually ordered french fries) were over fried and oily.   Our group which almost always orders desserts look at the dessert menu and felt underwhelmed by the most uninspiring dessert menu.  On a positive note the setting is very beautiful and on a nice day is quite enjoyable with a nice glass of wine.",

The food was very good, starting with the chestnut soup, so superb with nutmeg and spices, then the turkey dinner with brussel sprouts, piles of great turkey, dressing which I thought needed some more veggies and spice.  The dessert nice (we all got to go) pumpkin pie with a divine caramel sauce and cream fraiche possibly topping.  I give a five for the cost as the food could have been even more distinct for what we paid for.  Thank you overall, though, for a very nice evening.",

Situated along Lake Jacqueline 10 minutes from the strip, the outdoor covered patio set a beautiful, relaxing setting for a delicious meal. We opted to select a bottle of wine from the wine shop to drink with our dinner, and the man running the wine shop was a knowledgable and helpful aid in our decision. My husband and I started the evening by sharing a pot full of Prince Edward Island mussels, before ordering entrees of the red wine braised beef and beef tenderloin with wild mushrooms. Everything was outstanding, from the food to the atmosphere to the highly attentive staff.

They really need a makeover in this area. Our food came out wrong and instead of replacing It right away the server attempted to argue with me saying I ordered the wrong thing? I know what I ordered. Long story short we were there for 2 hours and when we FINALLY got our salmon Benedict it was nothing special. $60 later (for two Benedicts and two soups), we left so very disappointed. If you are looking for a nice and not too fancy French brunch I would recommend Bardot at Aria or even Mon Ami Gabi over this place.",

The food was great I love the concept of just picking the bottle of wine and consume it while your pairing it with your meal. That being said I wished we had a better service to complete the throughout experience. Our server was not attentive and she was a little bit rude. For instance, as she was pouring the wine into my Chablis glass she didn't use the serviette as she should have to wipe off the water that was dripping from the bottle of wine, therefore the water end up inside my goblet glass that I was drinking. My point is she should have a serviette as it's a wine place in the first place. And if someone asked to switch to a different wine glass, should get a different glass as every wine has a different flavor into it. Will definitely come back but hopefully I'll have a better experience next time.",

    "text": "Romantic and French on a lake in Las Vegas? It actually exists.Vive la France! Honestly this is the creme de la creme of restaurants as far as ambiance is concerned in the desert. Marche Bacchus sports a lovely wine shop upon entrance. While you are waiting to be sat at a table you browse through the selections and choose your wine. It's quite an enjoyable experience as you prepare yourself for a selection to take home as well. The wines are labeled with tasting notes, a dine-in price (corkage cost), as well as a take away price.   The dining is a mix of wine bar, indoor table seating and outside patio. There are fans and misters so that helps with the Vegas heat (or cool down with a freezing cold white). The floor to ceiling window enclosure on the patio open wide to the lake, with the passing families of ducks and lovely foliage that surrounds the space. The staff is friendly. The food is french bistro style. Time to time there is a lovely singer and her husband on the keyboard singing classic European songs (think - That's amore...)   It's on a lake in Las Vegas you can't get much better then that. It's romantic but pricey so make sure the date is a sure thing!  Oh the reason the one star is missing is because the service is hit or miss. We've been a couple of times now and the last time, we were practically ignored. We had our bottle which was getting very warm. We even asked the server for a wine opener since they were to busy to notice we had not been served and finally we poured our beautiful, delicious reisling (ourselves) into our water glasses, our waiter had dissappeared claiming to be getting our wine glasses - the horror - was the only way (for the wine snobs). Once noticed though, it was all good. After all its a restaurant in Vegas on a Lake. I forgave them!! Just hope it was an extremely busy day and this is not a habit.",

The instant you sit down on your patio table you are transported to a European vacation with blue waters and a warm breeze.  There are even ducks and black swans that swim right up to you.  I don't know what they put in my fancy water but I felt extremely happy in this place.  The food was presented beautifully.  Some were savory, while others bordered on bland.  Still delicious, and I would definitely go back.  The portions are quite conservative however, so if you are a hefty man, make sure you order the steak.. twice.  The awesome waitress and chef brought out a complimentary fruit bowl for my little man.  This is a picture perfect place for any occasion, and a must try for wine connoisseurs.",

Be sure to sit on the patio and be ready to feel as if you aren't in our beautiful desert climate. On your way out you can peruse their wine shop and pick out a bottle to accompany dinner. I like my bubbles, so insisted on champagne and a bottle of white.  I wasn't as impressed with the live music/entertainment as some other Yelpers. I think live music is very important to ambiance but my preference would have been a talent like Daniel Park or perhaps a straight acoustics musician. The man there this was a bit off his game (maybe he was sick?)  Anyway, on to the food! We ordered:  French Onion Soup Duck Confit Salad (Favorite!) Parpadalle White fish (special du jour)  There is no question that I will be back soon. MB is a nice alternative to the glitz of dinner out on the Strip.",

It was getting close to 1 pm, so I hoped we could miss the 12:00 lunch crush. It's 109 degrees today. There were many open tables, but we were seated on the patio. There were only fans to cool down the area. No one asked us if we had a preference. Once seated, we immediately were served water. My friend asked for a Diet Coke.  30 min later, the waiter came over and said, \"oh, you haven't gotten your Diet Coke yet. So sorry\" He leaves and comes back with the soda. We don't let him leave without our order because my friend has plans later. 30 minutes later, the waiter brings bread and apologizes for the wait again. There were no bread plates, but we had a basket of bread and placemats. About 2 minutes after the bread delivery, our food showed up.  The food was delicious. After we dined, the waiter came back and asked if I needed a box. I did and he left to get it. I asked for the dessert menu for a birthday treat. The waiter complied and left. 15 min later, the waiter returned for our order. By this time, we've been at this restaurant for 90 minutes. 15 min. Later, the cake showed up at the table, where the waiter apologized yet again for the wait. We pay the bill and after 2 hours, we leave. My friend lives near the airport and the restaurant is located in desert shores. She calls me at 4:15 from a grocery store near her home. This waiter forgot to return her card. I live closer to the place, so I have to go retrieve her card, and drive to the other side of town to return it. If I could give them less than 1 star- I would.",

In nice weather, it has to be great, but when it's cool outside, they have to put up the plastic panels, and turn on lots of outdoor propane heaters. We moved inside and it was then much more comfortable.. (it's not a large indoor area, so be sure and request an inside table if you are in doubt).  The 'retail wine shop' selection will find something for everyone, and prices are in line for what you are getting. It's nice to be able to upgrade to more expensive bottles, and not pay the normal 200-300% markup.  Will definitely return sometime... just wish they were on the opposite side of town.  Note:  The steak tartar was top notch, as was the spicy jambalaya.  Oh yea... and don't think of bringing your own bottle(s) to the restaurant... their BYOB policy is punitive ($25.00 btl).... they should just state they do not permit it..",

    "text": "We had a wonderful experience at this restaurant which is about 8 miles off the strip. We sat out on the large patio( I think everyone that night sat outside) that overlooks a small lake. There was a gentle breeze, adequate shade and soft music provided a very relaxing evening. It appeared everyone was taking 2-3 hour dinners and just enjoying the atmosphere and food.  When you get there, you walk into a wine store. We had reservations, so the hostess showed us to our table and told us to feel free to go back into the store, peruse the selection and buy our wine for the dinner. I thought the prices and variety were more than acceptable. Maybe they could have had more burgundy. There is also a list by the glass is buying a bottle is too much.  I enjoyed the special of crab meat dumplings that also included fresh corn, tomatoes and avocados, nice fresh and light. My Duroc Pork Chops were heavier with a more Southern spin to them with accompanied bitter cooked greens and very fine shoestring potatoes. We also had a duck dish that was well executed and cooked correctly to medium rare. The dressing with the duck was very savory and had a homey feel to it. The service was great.",

They have outside seating that has a beautiful view of the Lake.  Our favorite thing about the restaurant is that you can pick from a huge selection of wines.  We like to try new wines, and they are always helpful suggesting something based on the wines we know that we like.  The food has always been great, and we have never had bad service.  They are a little bit on the pricey side, but with good food and a great view it is definitely worth it.",

    "text": "Yesterday was my first visit to Marche. I got friends visiting in town from Cali. We all loved french bistro, so we went to Comme Ca, Mon Ami Gobi for the first two nights and decided to try something different off the strip. I read lots good review about this place on yelp and decided to give it a try. It took us almost 40 mins from Henderson to Summerlin. First impression of this place to me was really nice. We all loved the outdoor patio seating area with some kind of view of lake. Our waitress was friendly and menu price was quiet good compared to strip price. We ordered saffron seafood bisque and escargots persillad for appetizers, Poulet Frites, kobe beef hot-dog for entrees, CREME BRULEE A LA VANILLE, and GRAND MARNIER CHOCOLATE CAKE for deserts. The only dish I liked was saffron seafood bisque. Kobe beef hot-dog tasted nothing special to me. The sauce of my pan seared chicken breast was tasty but chicken skin was way too salty. All the french fries came with entrees were really salty. you could see sea salt all over the fries and plate!! And dish disappointed me the most was escargot. Escargot is always on my must order list whenever I dine in french restaurants. This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!! I tasted one bite and asked waitress to bring back to kitchen. I asked waitress to ask chef to try the dish and see how chef thinks. Our waitress replied chef said this is exactly how we serve this dish everyday. Really!!!!!!? well, if this is True, then I have to repeat what I just said earlier \" This is WORST ESCARGOT I ever tasted in my life!!!!\" I wonder if there was any kitchen staff spilled salt bottle located next to our escargots and fries!! I am not a complainer if you read all my other reviews on yelp. I am actually very generously with giving stars. But the reply from chef was really making me upset. In the end, manager took off one saffron soup and escargot from our check without lots apologies. Our waitress was a nice lady. She did feel bad that we didn't enjoy our meal. At least she showed she cared on her face not like the manager. I will keep my business in Comme Ca, Mon Ami Gobi and Bouchon and never come back again.",

The onion soup I had was bland and the lobster croissant sandwich was an affront to good seafood. I specifically asked about the quality of the lobster meat and was assured that is was \"wonderful\". When the sandwich arrived it had the shredded consistency of canned lobster and the bread was a cheap croissant that was way too buttery (not even close to the pastry pictured in the photos from the restaurant). It was the first time I can remember actually being angry at my lunch. The wine shop , however, is excellent and they only charge $10 for a corkage fee. Although,  I can't understand why they don't have a wine list. You are forced walk around the shop to find what you want, which is usually a wonderful, but occasionally I find that it would be nice to have a list to guide you.",

    "text": "Another for the Hidden Gem File!  This is possibly one of the most obscure dining destinations in Las Vegas , but well worth the trek off the strip and into suburbia.  Located on the banks of a man made lake in the West side of the Valley, and well hidden.  If you don't know where this is, you will never find it.  Best part is my mother, age 79, had this in her bag of tricks.  You enter into a wine store replete with rows of wine bins and, I must say, a fairly nice selection of wines and affordable prices.    Now, the great part.  You exit the back of the store onto a large dining patio that is terraced to the water, fireplace, lakeside etc etc.   Very nice , beautiful and comfortable.    Our server, Kelly, a Los Angeles transplant, was knowledgeable and very informative.  We started with a Napa Silver Oak for $95 then on to Prisoner cab for $65.00, nice glasses and presentation with a serene view of the lake and sky.  The bad part :(.  Food is not worthy of the ambiance and wine selection.  We had the upgraded wine and cheese platter, which included two pate (one pork and one pork and chicken), a lobster salad (not good) Quince jam, apple slices, very fishy Salmon and some very fatty and warm salami.  We gave it another chance and ordered the escargot (flavorless) and the mussels.  Mussels were tender but not much flavor.  Ambiance         5 Wine Selection  4 Service               4 Food                    1   Overall               3 and I will be back!",

What a great experience - from the wine selection to the music to the ambiance on the water to the great service to the delicious food.  LOVED IT! so i signed up for the newsletter and found out about the brunch.  Last weekend came for a Brunch on a Sunday.  It was a beautiful day so we requested a table on the patio in advance. I got a completely different experience - i'm not sure if brunches are a new thing to this place, but it was BAD.  The heating lamps werent working because it was chilly in the shade.  The server was pissed off at the world and didn't want to be there. The food was mediocre (and i'm being generous).  Advertized potatos were fried to a crips and were out of the bag frozen variety.  Poached eggs wasn't poached - it was fried!  The overall brunch experience was pretty disappoiting...  i think i'll stick to going there for dinner and not brunch...   unless they catch up as a brunch place.",

    "text": "I agree with Michelle C.'s review. I went there with some friends just a few nights ago. First of all, we specifically asked for a particular table right by the water when we made our initial reservations and we even called the day of to confirm this table again. When we got there, we were told that our table was not available. The owner said she would see if the patrons at our table would be willing to move, but there were no guarantees. We graciously agreed to take another table.   Aside from a relieved smile and a simple \"thank you\" there were no other acknowledgments over this mishap that could have been prevented with better planning on the part of the restaurant's management team.   Then we were charged $25 as a corkage fee for EACH bottle we brought in to drink. Corkage fees north of the strip are now illegal, but I guess it's an easy thing to ignore if you think your customers are not too savvy about new culinary laws.   Again, we were gracious and paid our bill. However, when we spoke to the owners about our dissatisfaction all they did was give us blank stares to our faces but made sure to roll their eyes when they thought our backs were turned. That, was just too much. How unprofessional!",

At Marche Bacchus, it is soo different, warm, inviting, close and yet spacious with beautiful scenery and a totally relaxed, charming place to be, made me feel I wasn't in Las Vegas but on an island.  This place will be on my  Las Vegas FAVORED list for atmosphere, warmth, excellent food, service and a great relaxing get away.  Service is prompt and all those patrons leaving the establishment had smiles on their faces, full & satisfied tummy's.  I spoke with the patrons as they were leaving and so graciously filled my tip jar and thanked me and as I asked \" how was your dinner ?\"  all replies were \" very satisfied and they would be returning.\"  I've been singing in restaurants over several years and truly \" I KNOW SATISFIED CUSTOMERS\" these customers left blissful..

This restaurant (I believe) once started primarily as a wine shop with a small dining area but has morphed into one of the most romantic/yummy dining spots in the city. On the inside they have a wine shop with some great hard-to-find wine selections and a nice dining area. The outside dining area hosts a covered patio overlooking the Desert Shores lake. What's great about this outside space is that it is surprisingly cool in the 110 degree weather and warm (with heaters) on winter nights.  THE FOOD IS AMAZING, TOO. I have yet to try a dish I don't like. The lunch menu runs about $15 to $20, and the evening menu gets a little bit pricier. But it is 100% worth the price. And be sure to order the creme brulee every time you come.  The service is great as well. I would suggest putting yourself on the \"European dining schedule\" and just relax. (Us Americans tend to expect strangely quick service everywhere we go, but you will want to sit back and relax here).    *As of July 2018, the inside has gone under renovations.",

We had so much fun eating here. Not only was the food great, the experience was fun as well. You walk in and are in a wine shop. They have a HUGE variety of wines, some of them hard to find at your typical store. I love this aspect. You can pick a bottle to eat with dinner, or come back in the middle of dinner and grab another. Really unique.   We loved everything we tried, but here's what I recommend. Salmon Steak & Frites French Onion Soup Goat Cheese Truffle Appetizer (this was so good we tried to recreate it at home)  I highly recommend you sit on the patio when you eat here or else it will be a loss. The views and the ambience outside completely blow the inside seating out of the water (pun intended).  My only complaint was that service was VERY slow. Which is not terrible if you are patient, not in a rush or just enjoying yourself. But once dinner is creeping well over 2 hours, I usually start to get a little antsy.

On the way out stopped at the bar... wtf... the selection of rums, tequila and whiskey was unlike anything I've ever seen. Maybe 100k in dark booze right in front of me.  I tried the Ron Zacapa XO Centanario Rum. Whoa.  I experienced something special tonight, thanks.  I left a review because it was that good.",

    "text": "It took longer almost 15 mns for our desserts to be served, by the time they brought it, sorbets/gelato and smores mousse was melting. Smores portion was small and tasted plain, not worth $10. Add a little of Graham crackers and bits of Hershey's to it, it will surely impress our taste buds. But the passion fruit and berry sorbets tasted great. The Lobsters Salad crossiant was ok, bread was soggy not a fan of sweet after taste probably taste better in a French bread or French Baguette. Ordered steak medium well and it came out medium, bloody red but was juicy and it tasted good. Chicken and Waffle tasted great. My husband liked the Pulled Pork Benedict. The Grits and medallions was cooked beautifully would be perfect if add more pieces of of the beef. Ambience and noise level was great, Family Friendly and love the outdoor seating. As for the Service, she deserved the 17% tip, but would have been better if they didnt slacked at the end. We felt like they forgot us and our desserts since we were the last customers seating for the Brunch. The Hostess was ok, she just need improvement instead of saying \" yes may I help you\" would have sounded better with a \"welcome to Marche Bacchus, how may I help you\" plus add a smile to it. But she did good in checking our table and walking us to our table. When we left the restaurant,  she was too busy in the phone, and didn't bother saying anything like \"thank you or come again next time\". The only staff who noticed us leave the restaurant was the Bartender who smiled at us and thanked us. This restaurant is a neighborhood gem, just need a little improvement on the service, quality and value of food. It's a change for us who are used to eating at the strip. We were supposed to dine at Giada but chose this restaurant and we did not regret it. Overall, our Family had a wonderful brunch.",

Also ordered yellowtail crudo which was a sizable portion and had a great fennel flavor (maybe a little too much fennel).  My wife had filet mignon as her entree which was cooked to perfection and delicious.  I ordered the seared scallops and was disappointed with small portion of only 3 scallops and a hand full of small pieces of diced potatoes.  The flavor was good but not worth the price for the small plate.  This would be better served as an appetizer.  We also ordered desserts, creme brulee which was very creamy and had a good vanilla flavor.  My wife had the cheesecake which was a little on the dry side.   Our server had forgotten to serve us bread which takes away from the attention to detail for the price we were paying for our meals on a special occasion.  We were very pleased with our first visit but will look for another French restaurant when we visit Las Vegas and want to celebrate.",

The restaurant called me 2 days before the event to ask me if I could change my reservation to 6:30pm  and I said yes no problem. Well I arrived at 6:30 pm and finally got to order a drink by 7pm.I realized it was 8:15pm and still no food coming our way. When we asked we had someone from the restaurant who came over and said \"all of you guys reserved at the same time and the kitchen is fired up \" !!! Really ??? Which manager would say that to customers when they are the ones changing everyone's-reservation. Then he said I'll bring some champagne over to you guys and in the end charged us for it . By 9pm the main course arrived and that was not what I ordered so I sent it back. . I mean if you guys are planning an event at your restaurant at least be prepared and do not blame the customers for booking  at the same time, do not have people wait 2 hours literally between courses and have some class and bring complimentary drinks when you say you will and do not charge the customers for it !!!",

At that point the server said no worries he'll take care of it no need to and we left. The smell of the lake water was yucky and the windows dirty , bats flying close to the open glass doors open.

As we were moved to the other side near the lake, we were told we couldn't have the table that I originally requested; come to find out it was promised at the same time to the managers friends. We never were given an apology or saw the manager again after we disclosed our disappointment. The food is outrageously expensive for sub par- this local has eaten much much better elsewhere. Take your business near the Strip for much better French cuisine and at half the cost! My wife couldn't even finish the pork loin, which was decent to say it best.

We brought a cake as we were celebrating a birthday. Our waiter offered to cut the cake for us but then said he was told it would be a $1.50 per person cake cutting charge. We figured we could do it ourselves and save the $15! He brought us a knife and extra plates and to-go boxes. Overall very pleasant ambiance and excellent service and the food was okay.

The whole space has a great ambiance, especially with the lakeside patio. There's also a bar and lounge area next to the shop. Although it wasn't particularly hot that day, it wasn't cool enough to want to sit outside (everyone else did).  FIRST COURSE  Soup du Jour: Potato Leek Soup with bacon and croutons. The soup was thick, but not heavy and very flavorful. I loved the addition of bacon.  Fresh Burrata Cheese with Heirloom Tomatoes: Balsamic vinegar, ciabatta croutons, and basil oil. This was just okay. The burrata was nice, but I've had much better salads of its kind. I would have enjoyed more tomato as well.  SECOND COURSE  Poulet Frites: Roasted chicken breast, fries, and natural chicken jus. We both ordered this dish and loved it. My chicken was slightly dry, but the jus was so, so good! The fries were really fantastic as well (Top 10) and tasted amazing when soaked in the jus. More jus please!  THIRD COURSE  Tiramisu: Mascarpone, vanilla lady fingers, espresso, and Kahlua. This is one of my favorite desserts and of course, I'm very particular about it. That said, I did not like this tiramisu. I don't know what it was, but I did not like the flavor and didn't finish it.  Creme Brulee: Vanilla bean custard and caramelized sugar. This was really nice! The custard was oh, so creamy. Delicious.  Service was very pleasant and we enjoyed our time. Great spot for a date and certainly a fantastic place to purchase wine. We would love to return when it cools down and enjoy dining lakeside.",

I found Marche Bacchus on OpenTable and it had great reviews and an open reservation. Booking was super smooth. When we arrived the hostess obviously didnt' want to be working Christmas Eve, and didn't even ask how we were doing and couldn't drudge up a smile. I had put in the notes that this was our wedding dinner, but I doubt that was ever conveyed to the waiter. Our waiter was nice, pretty talkative, but also clueless and never asked what brought us in that night (we were obviously dressed up formally). So, that was pretty disappointing. He also rarely checked up on us and was too busy talking with other tables to ensure we had proper refills. In all honesty, when I spent $230 on a dinner for three people to celebrate getting married, it would have just been nice to receive a heartfelt congratulations. Even chain restaurants have that level of customer service down. The food was delicious, and the ambiance was wonderful. Just not sure if I would be back based on service alone.  Update: I filled out a long review via OpenTable with a direct message to the restaurant, and even left my contact information. The restaurant never attempted to contact me about our experience. Disappointing.",

When I read the reviews on here, I thought some of these people just got unlucky, however, after actually receiving bad service from them, I will most likely not be going back. First there was a bug in my water and I asked the waiter so kindly if he was able to get me a new water. That took about 5 minutes. We ordered our drinks and decided what we were going to have for brunch. They all sounded amazing. But then our server started taking awhile to come. My sister had to call out for someone to get him and that took another 10 minutes or so. We asked for the mussels to come out as an appetizer and he also recommended it. He took our orders down without writing it (weird I thought, but at the same time I thought maybe he had a good memory).  I was wrong. He came back 10-15 minutes later and repeated the orders and got one of them wrong. He said and the mussels will be out shortly. He brought out the dishes and fork for the mussels. It was about 20 minutes later and our food came. But no mussels.  We told our waiter and his response was, \"okay\". That was all. No apology. At that point, I was ready to leave. I didn't even enjoy the food. They don't come and check on you while you're eating nor do they fill up your water or ask if you would like more wine. The view is nice but you might want to stay away from the bad service.",

We made reservations about 10 days ahead of time and requested to be on the patio by the water. First of all, we were seated in probably the worst spot in the restaurant; on the patio but the last table, not near the water. Within a few minutes a wedding venue that was nextdoor,with windows overlooking the dining area, started up with loud music. I had been looking forward to treating myself with their \"Roasted Hudson Valley Foie Gras\". This was not Fois Gras. It was something like a very fluffy mousse with no Fois Gras taste. When asked for a small butter knife to spread this concoction, I was told to use my large butter knife! I told the waitress that this was not Faux Gras and she told me the Chef had just changed the recipe.  Next, I had ordered the flat iron steak. The steak was so salty it was practically inedible. The Pomme Frits came out of a frozen bag not homemade. On the plus side, my husband said his escargots were good and so were the scallops. I just think you should get something a little better for $200.",

It was my favorite. Octopus was tasty as well.   Lunch time is beautiful. Seeing the ducks play in the water and the turtles being turtles. The lobster croissant is delicious and I got to try the most expensive hotdog with truffles. lol. It was actually really good.   The only thing is service is really slow. They come to your table far and few in between. My glass of Rose during lunch was closer to room temp not cold and refreshing as expected. But the server didn't come around until after the food arrived. By then I am not going to say anything about the wine because at that point I've had it for so long.   I still give them 4 stars because the food is excellent.",

Makes you feel like you've just escaped Vegas for a second.   The restaurant  has an impressive selection of wines that you can choose from. The food was fantastic. We had the beef carpaccio which was tender and very flavorful. The Escargot... only because we felt like it was the \"french\" entree to order..no regrets! The steak tartar was also very good but nothing special.   For dessert, we had the bread pudding and beignets. Both delicious but the bread pudding definitely out-shined the beignets.   The ambiance is surreal...very romantic.  Overall I could not have asked for a more enjoyable lunch. Great food, lakeside seating, and classical french music playing. I can't wait to come back.",

On my last visit I had the escargot, muscles, octopus, cheese plate, creme brulee and French wine. The escargot was excellent, the muscles were dry and the octopus was semi-burnt. The cheese and meat plate was good, the Creme brulee was really good. It's generally difficult to find a good creme brulee in this town so I was delighted to have found that. I'll continue going back to Marche Bacchus for the escargot, wine and creme brulee but I don't know if would opt for any entrees. I've been underwhelmed by the entrees a number of times. As always, the service is really good and so is the atmosphere.",

Both were outstanding and enjoyed the poppy seed dressing on the arugula salad that accompanied the steak tar tar. Then entrees, I had the lobster croissant with the chestnut soup du jour which I would have again and again. Staff was friendly and attentive while also letting us talk and catch up. Dessert was the tiramisu which we almost licked the cup. Love this place!!",

It turned out to be one of the best decisions in Vegas lol. It is approximately 14 miles from the Strip but well-worth the visit seriously. It has both outdoor and indoor seating. It is set on a \"lake\" in the section of town called Desert Shores. You don't feel like you were in Las Vegas and is a refreshing change from Casino and the hustle and madness in downtown Vegas. As you enter the restaurant you pass a large selection of wine that you can purchase to drink with your dinner. The bottle prices are very reasonable in comparison to other Vegas restaurants from my experiences. If the weather cooperates, dine outside as it is lovely and soothing. The menu is varied - mostly with a French twist - and everything we ordered here was INCREDIBLE. As a Las Vegas visitor, Marche Bacchus is a restaurant I will try to make one of my go to spots when in the area. The staff friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu. You can't go wrong here from staff to the food just a PERFECT EXPERIENCE.",

You can get away with dressing up or down at Marche, which is nice.  The service here is terrible. I'd set aside at least two hours to eat. If you're into slow service aren't bothered by slow servers, then Marche is definitely worth checking out.  French onion soup is some of the best in Las Vegas! Definitely worth trying - although heavy, probably better to split!   I probably won't be back...but I wouldn't be decline a dinner party invitation if it was hosted here.",

I ordered a delicious Reisling and linguine pescatora. Spicy but really good! Had plenty to take home for leftovers too wooo! Got a cheese and meat platter for an appetizer to share - the candied onions and bell peppers on it were phenomenal! The presentation of that dish was kind of ugly but flavors were good! Also got the cucomber and tomato salad as a starter and the dressing on it was perfect.    I definitely plan to come back! It is also the perfect spot for a romantic date!  UPDATE: Bought the Groupon for that date idea and came for a weekday lunch. Waiter barely seemed to care about us once he found out we had a Groupon. He gave us regular menus and saiid we could pick anything for the Groupon. Then he came back after we were ready to order (and excited!!!!) and told us we actually had to use the special Groupon menu. The Groupon menu only had about 6 entree courses and three appetizers - compared to a HUGE regular menu. Most of the Groupon items were sandwichs...little french influence. We were pretty bummed. I ended up with the black rice risotto which was quite decadent but delicious. Id advise you to skip the Groupon for this place! Just order off the regular menu and pay full price.",

They added a handful of pasta dishes. DELICIOUS DELICIOUS! Something that they're doing different than other restaurants is the option of making your pasta as an \"appetizer\" or \"entree\" portions. This is such a great idea....especially for small eaters. The appetizer portion was perfect for my date and myself. I had the Shrimp and Lobster pasta with a spicy garlic tomato sauce. My date had the Papperdelle meat pasta.  We also ordered Parmesan garlic fries and a Cobb salad.  I feel like this is a perfect place to go during the spring/summer time....when it starts to get dark later. The sunset glistening and you see the reflection on the lakes....oh mai gawd! LOL. Gorgeous...just gorgeous. Don't know how well it'll be during the colder months though. I'm sure if you're not a fan of the cold...it would be a struggle.  Definitely a great hidden gem here in our city!",

The creme brulee was really good though as was the tiramisu.   I don't know if I will be coming back here again.",

    "text": "I originally made a reservation for lunch for 10-11 for today but unforseen events happened so, my  eye started twitching from stress and I had to change it to dinner for 9 people yesterday. They were very accommodating.  I got there early before everyone else in my group got there just so I can make sure everything was on point.  I was looking at their great selection of wines then Rhonda took me to our table.  The view of the lake was just too gorgeous and that was the start of a great dinner.  Our server last night was Jim and he did a fantastic job.  He made good food and wine recommendations.  He told us that they were celebrating their 5th anniversary under their current management and they gave us complimentary champagne.  I had a strong craving for beef the whole day yesterday and so I got the steak frites eventhough I really wanted to try the parsley and lobster roe tagliatelle - there's always a next time.  The steak frites was good.  The rest of the group had the charcuterie plate, crab cake and risotto...yum!  For dessert we had the coffee and doughnuts (beignets lightly dusted with powdered sugar with chicory dipping sauce) - they're nice and warm bite-size pieces that taste similar to Cafe du Monde's beignets minus the thick coating of powdered sugar.  We also had creme brulee, chocolate mousse trio and bread pudding with rum sauce.  Delightful!  We were there for 3 hours.  The timing of when each course was served was just right.  It allowed us to talk and laugh (a lot), rest and digest.  I believe that a nice dinner is meant to be enjoyed and not rushed.  If you're in a hurry, you could always go somewhere else.  But if you're surrounded by people you like and want a nice meal then, Marche Bacchus is the place for you.",

For our appetizer I had the heirloom tomato salad and my husband devoured the smoked salmon macaroons. Oh the flavor combinations were so delicious!! We loved the ambience on the lake side with black swans to watch. A perfect evening with my love and enjoying the delicious food as well.

    "text": "Without question the worst service I've experienced in years. I found this place in a Yelp search, and drove here because it looked like my kind of place: a wide selection of wine with good food. I arrived at 545p and stood at the hostess counter for nearly 10 minutes, while the hostess spoke on the phone and only glanced up at me once. She then said \"sorry about that\" and I thought cool, just a minor glitch.  Informed her it was my first visit and asked how seating worked, as I saw a bar in the front, a dining room, and an outdoor area. She said it was my choice, and when I asked about the patio, she welcomed me to seat myself. When I walked outside there was a large group of people having a private party. I came back inside and said the patio appears to be closed, and she said \"oh yeah, there's a private event\" --- OK, why didn't you tell me?  She then asked \"did you just want to look around or are you interested in getting something?\" Huh, what an odd question. I said that I'd like a glass of wine and something to eat, then asked (again) where to sit. She offered me the bar or dining room, so I chose the bar.   The hostess gave me a wine and food list and asked if I wanted water, I said yes. When she returned with the water a few minutes later she asked if I knew what I wanted, and I inquired about a reserve wine I didn't recognize. She then asked me to point to it on the menu, but couldn't answer any of my questions -- she didn't know anything about the wines! She then sat the bottle in front of me and said \"here's the bottle,\" and walked away.  I Vivino'd the bottle and decided I wanted a glass, but she never returned to take my order. She walked past once and said \"I'll be with you in a moment,\" but after over 20 minutes I finally left. What a frustrating experience, especially because I also needed to pick up a bottle of wine for a dinner event.",

Sitting on the patio is indeed a treat and the weather was wonderful today. Our service was so-so.  Slow and not friendly at all. (the server specifically) The worst part is that I was surprised that it was never mentioned to us that there is a $10 corkage fee for getting a bottle from the store.  I discovered this on my bill and it says \"restaurant 750ml\", so I had to ask to make sure that was what it was.  Which I would not have minded, had I been informed.  I don't think its a stretch that this should be stated up front, to customers when they ask about it before ordering wine.",

You walk into a wine shop which is stocked with a killer wine selection. Fun fact: you can buy a bottle to enjoy with your lunch. Not so fun fact: you are charged a corkage fee at lunch. Okay, no biggie.  There is a gorgeous patio overlooking the lake in the back. The space is somewhat small and there are a few servers taking care of tables in the space. Vito was ready to take our order so we ordered escargot. My table mate explained to him that she was allergic to shellfish which he assured her would not be an issue. We googled it after he walked away to discover that it would be an issue and asked to swap our order. Even after explaining that her reaction would be severe if she ate it he replied, \"Well, I already ordered it\" and walked away.  When ordering our food it wasn't much better. When we asked if he had ranch we were met with, \"I don't think so\" and then just stared at her. The attitude of our server was simply a bit off putting and made our entire table uncomfortable. Once we painfully submitted our order we were never checked on during our meal. Even the table next to us was having a tough time as I overheard that there was another dietary restriction that was overlooked and she was having issues as well. At the end of our meal or server awkwardly dropped off our check.  The food was mediocre, the wine and views excellent, but the service was rough. I'm not sure I'll be back soon unless I'm in need of a nice bottle of Pinot Noir.",

I have heard from many friends how much they like this restaurant and how nice it is to get a patio table lakeside and enjoy the food and scenery.  Coming for lunch when it was 100+ degrees, I decided to stay inside despite misters and fans on the patio.  The three items I ordered along with their menu descriptions.  Smoked salmon tartine - Avocado, Red Onion, Capers, Creme Fraiche, Country Bread Chicken picatta - Lemon Capers, White Wine, King Trumpet Mushrooms, Fingerling Potatoes Creme brulee  I didn't realize the restaurant was so small but at 1 PM, there were several tab;es available and a few people went outside.  Walking along rows of boxes of wine for sale, I was seated at the end of the booth closest to the store part of the building with a view of the patio and the lake beyond.  The tartine was good and had plenty of smoked salmon.  The menu in the restaurant had picatta in quotes.  I think that's because they didn't serve a traditional piccata with the breast pounded thin but rather it was a regular half chicken breast that was sliced and placed on the accompanying items.  The sauce had a mild lemon flavor and it was rich and flavorful.  The pieces of potato and the mushrooms added to the dish.  The creme brulee--something I generally skip because if you've had one you've had them all--doesn't apply in this case.  It was some of the best vanilla bean custard I've tasted and the top was thicker and crunchier than I've had before.  It is really good!  Service was good.  I was brought a fresh glass of iced tea without needing to ask and the meal was coursed with just the right amount of time between each course.  This is a return place for dinner on the patio when it cools down.",

If you get a chance to sit on the patio which is first come first serve you can watch the Bellagio water show!   The service is really good and the food is also delicious I always get the eggs Benedict and my girlfriend always gets the quiche.  Her parents got the lemon crepes which they love but they are a little too sweet for me.    Always a good experience here whether you sit on the patio or inside the restaurant.  Very pleasant atmosphere.   I will definitely come back here again for brunch and I also want to come here for dinner as well as a few of my friends have said it's really good.",

First of all, the place was cold and only upper area had heaters but the lower section where were sitting had no heater and wind blows into the thin glass walls. There weren't tablecloth where we were sitting but upper area had. We paid the same set menu price and shivered all evening in our table area. Waiting person forgot butter and even after we requested still it never came. The kale salad was so salty and thin crab leg was cold. We don't mind paying for what's worth but this place is absolutely overrated. We paid almost $300 for two, and the experience was absolutely terrible!!",

    "text": "Stopped in to grab a glass of wine before my spa treatment next door. The spa staff recommended here or another nearby restaurant. I first walked into the other restaurant and wasn't greeted at all... So that made the decision to come here easy! Walked in, was greeted in about 45 seconds, by a super friendly hostess/bartender(?). As I was only here for a quick glass of wine, she seated me at the bar. Very cute place settings, super comfy seats too. Iced water or bottled water was offered, then the wine list. Quite extensive with good descriptions. I was offered to taste any I was interested in-I tasted a Riesling and a French Rhone. Both delicious. Pricing was what I expected at a wine-centric restaurant.   Note--if you sit at the bar, you are also sitting in the wine shop area (they sell many selections by the bottle). So not super intimate if that's what you're going for on the bar side of things.  Looks like there is some remodeling going on-my view from the bar is an unfinished wall.  Would love to come back sometime and try the restaurant side of things. Apparently you can sit outside and enjoy the lake view while dining.",

Here is the problem.  To prepare for our party, we sampled the lunch menu about a month prior,  introduced ourselves to the manager in person and made the reservation on the spot.  The manager even show us the semi private area that was tugged away and reserved for our party.  Now looking back, that was just some slick Vegas advertising talk as our \"real\" party was set up in a completely different area.   And conveniently, on the day of our party, it was also the manager's day off.  The manager did not answer the repeated calls from our server.  We reluctantly accepted the hand that was dealt.    Since then, we have received no communication less an apology from the restaurant owners or the manager.  But it would be our last time to dine or host our party there and none of our invited guests will patronize this place on their future visits ever.  This place is not exactly close to the strip with easy access.  So long !",

The area was originally built by Steve Wynn. It overlooks the lake. I've tried many selections from their menu but my favorite is the Chicken with Forbidden Rice. The rice is almost like a risotto with chicken broth and White Asparagus sauce. I also had the Vanilla Panna Cotta today. They also have a great wine selections since they are also a wine shop. I like to order the J. Lohr Chardonnay since I've never seen it offered at other places by the glass.",

Had mussels they were decent. Had crab cakes, bland taste with no lump crab meat only shredded. Had escargot, not served in the shells? I thought that was a little weird, tasted as they usually do, again average. Had jambalaya it was tasty but nothing to write home about.  Service was polite but  rather sparse.    This was assessment was after driving over 30 miles from Henderson, I was starving! Anyway, maybe if I lived closer I would be a little more forgiving but its just not worth the effort for me. BTW very cool concept of picking your wine from the store for your dinner.   I am excited about their neighbor Garfield's, got a very  good artichoke appetizer, excellent service, wish I had eaten dinner there. Will be driving back to eat at Garfield's NOT Marche Bacchus.",

We ordered Escargot to start, I had Prince Edward Island mussels with a side of garlic fryers and husband had Seared duck in honey and spice glaze for our mains. The warm bread with whipped butter was divine as usual. Garlic herb butter the escargot were clocked in was very nice but one of the snails came with sand:( at this point we were still quite happy, enjoying a bottle of Rombauer Chardonnay, bread and our starter. Then the mains arrived. What a disappointment! The mussels were overlooked, the sauce was super salty, the fries probably were the worst fries I have ever had. They seemed to have been lightly battered to increase crispness but instead of tasting of garlic and herbs the flavor was slightly reminiscent of chicken fingers. Needless to say I put it away after two bites. The duck, while prepared in a very flavorful sauce, was undercooked and quite fatty. The waiter noticed that I was not eating and commented that the restaurant had changed chefs not that long ago. We were offered a complimentary crime brulee which I must say was perfect but no one offered to take my my barely touched food off the bill ( we didn't expect it but it definitely would have bean a good will gesture prompting us to give the restaurant another try). I give two stars because we had great service ( I can't blame the server for not offering to take uneaten food off the bill, clearly manager's fault ), beautiful view, amazing acoustic guitarist, wonderful warm bread and delicious desert. Unfortunately, this was our last visit to Marche Bacchus:((((",

Our group had a private, tented, heated \"room\" out on the patio, which was quite lovely on a chilly April evening.  The waitstaff was beyond attentive, and our wine glasses were never empty.  They also did a great job of teaching us about the wines we were tasting, and explaining why those particular wines had been chosen to compliment our meal.  I could have been happy with just the bread basket and soup du jour, but the rest of the meal was perfectly lovely as well.  Although I'm not sure it would be worth the pricey cab ride to trek out here from the strip (we were just down the road at Red Rock, so it wasn't much of a drive), I'd recommend Marche Bacchus to anyone local or staying nearby.",

The waiter took forever to bring us bread & drinks at the beginning & basically ignored us most of the dinner. Other diners who were sat after us received their food before us because it took so long to take our order. For a restaurant of this caliber, this is unacceptable. The swordfish was a wee bit dry but good with the sauce. The salmon was good but one of my guests complained the steak had an herb he could not identify & left food on plate (he said it was all him & not the food).

For some reason I have been all about mussels lately and they're not something that appears on every menu, so I jump on them when I get the chance.  The Moules Frite at Marche Bacchus were FANTASTIC!  Washed down with a glass of Sav Blanc and enjoyed alongside their yummy pomme frite...I was in heaven!  Hubby's burger was a hit as well, though how you go to a French bistro and order a burger is kind of beyond me ;-)  The service here is outstanding, and sitting lakeside is a plus.  At least once during every meal I find myself saying, \"It doesn't even feel like we're in Vegas.\"  We're kind of hooked on the Saturday lunches because we can eat early then hit the free wine tasting right after.  We always walk out with a bottle or two, or three.  Planning to do dinner one of these nights to get the full experience.",

I will say that the lakeside location is nice. It's overpriced. In fact, I can eat at Bouchon, have a great dinner, with the same noise, better ambience and certainly finer food.",

    "text": "Went to my favorite little spot by the lake at Desert Shores last friday the 17th with some clients of mine. I was hoping to have the (French Guy) Stephan but, he was, unfortunately for us, on vacation. We made due with our waiter who lacked the color and attention of Stephan. But anyway, the food as always, at least when I'm here, was flawless. The photos I took with my iPhone were not up to my standards so forgive me for not posting. Will be taking my Pro Canon everywhere I go from now on no matter how obnoxious that that be. We started with the simple Romaine Salad, crisp and fresh. Then moved right into to main course.  I had the Pasta Jambalya, the spice in this dish creeps up on you. It took a couple of bites before it hit me. This Entree came with three Jumbo Shrimp, plenty of chicken and sausage and tossed with Fettuccini pasta in a roasted tomato cream. My clients also enjoyed their dinner. I didn't have a taste and can only say that  they had the Grilled Scotttish Salmon and the Grilled Veal Chop. We all finished with the simple but great Bread Pudding.",

    "text": "I read on Zagat that this was one of the top patios in the country.  I don't know how scientifically accurate such a statement is, but it's a pretty awesome patio that looks out over the water.  Yes, you can see an apartment complex, but it is totally different from anything in Las Vegas and one of the more authentic experiences you can have in manufactured Summerlin.  There's so many cool things about this place, but my favorite is that when you walk in to be seated, you can browse the wine store and pick out your wine for dinner.  So cool.  Split a bottle of Prisoner.  Such a good wine.  Started with French Onion soup and the salad du jour (heirloom tomatoes, a mild cheese and a very yummy balsamic reduction.)  Like all the other reviews say, this soup is out of this world, but the salad was awesome too.  Very acidic, the tomatoes were fresh.  I loved it but if you do not like vinegar, pass on the salad.  For entrees we had braised short ribs with bleu cheese mashed potatoes and steak frites.  The braised short ribs were good but the bleu cheese mashed potatoes were too much for me despite my love of all things bleu and cheese.  The steak frites melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly.  Definitely a pricey dinner but an experience unlike any I have ever had in Las Vegas.  So glad I waited four years to come here because I have a feeling I'm going to be spending a lot of money at this place in the future!",

    "text": "2.5 STARS ~!!!  My boyfriend and I haven't really had time to celebrate our 2 year anniversary so this was kind of our 2 year & 2+ months anniversary dinner thing haha. I've had this place bookmarked for forever and it seemed like a good fit for us since we wanted something low-key and didn't want anything on the strip. I made reservations a couple weeks ago and requested a table right along the edge right by the water which is the only reason I chose this restaurant...I've worked in food and beverage so I know requests can't be guaranteed but they are still possible to grant with proper planning and especially if it is for a special occasion.  When we got to the restaurant the hostess had 0 personality. Not even a smile, a welcome, a how are you, happy anniversary..nothing.. just borderline rudeness! I don't know if she was new but she seemed a little flustered. At that point a server came around and angrily asked her why she would seat a 6 top party with no menus.. and she mumbled something back.. IDK it was just a really weird start to the night and a bad first impression of the restaurant.   We waited for 10 minutes or so for our table which was not a problem since you can kill time by looking around at their wine selection.  We got seated and I was NOT happy with our table. It was small  and not to mention the farthest table from the lake on the patio. I had a view but my boyfriend didn't have any. UGH. Then looking at my menu I realized they gave me a brunch menu.. no one came to greet us or even fill our water glasses for 10 minutes. At this point I just wanted to leave... but my boyfriend was getting hungry and said we should just wait it out. Someone finally brought us water.. I asked the guy for a dinner menu and he never brought me one.. Then 15 minutes into us being seated I see 2 tables right by the lake finish and leave. If the hostess knew what the hell she was doing she would have had us wait at the bar so we could have been seated at the table I requested. But what ever.. at this point I just needed some wine badly.  Finally our server came and took our orders. Apparently she had been there since noon which I had heard some other servers say too. So they are understaffed and most of their servers are tired. Our server was nice but half way through the meal I stopped seeing her so I'm assuming she left for the night... would have been nice if she told us she was leaving.   The food was just OK here.. not bad but not amazing..if this food was being served at a restaurant that didn't have a view of a lake then I'm sure it wouldn't be doing as well. We ordered:  -Bacchus Cheese & Charcuterie platter ($21) When the food runner dropped this off she started to tell us what was on it and then she stopped and said she forgot.. LOL wow it would have been nice to know what the hell we were eating but oh well.. It was nice to graze on with our wine. -Bread: Their bread basket was just some warm sliced ciabatta bread..  -Steak Frittes ($25) Decent steak with really crispy fries.. -Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast ($30) It was good but I would have liked a more sweet glaze to go with it..  -In House Wine: You can just select a wine from the front store and bring it to your table and the server will add it on to the bill.. They charge $10 to whatever the retail price is.. Wines start at $15 ($25 in the restaurant) -Corkage fee: If you want to bring in your own bottle of wine there is a $25 fee  I find it really funny that after they brought the bill to the table and after they ran my card they asked if we wanted dessert.. LOL   In the end, I had an enjoyable night because I was with the man I love and the live flamenco player was a nice touch too.. but it also could have been due to the fact that we finished 2 bottles of wine so I was feeling good. but MAN Service I think is half of the experience of dining at a restaurant and this place sucked booooty in that department. If the service was good I would give Marche Bacchus 4 stars but it was just so BAD...I really am tempted to give it another go for brunch but I don't want to have to guzzle down 2 bottles of wine again just to enjoy my meal.   HOT TIP: I have none. I hope the service is better for you.",

They're French toast was skimpy, it was one slice of bread cut in half it looked as if it were off the kids menu not substantial for an adult, normally it's two pieces 4 wedges of bread. Even at the $11.00 price point it was skimpy.  The steak and eggs were great, abundant and at $17.00 a dish well worth it. Salmon Eggs Benedict were well prepared and delicious.  Our sever was nice and polite but at some point seemed overwhelmed. We ordered escargot and cheese platter to share before our brunch, which were delicious and well prepared.  After we finished our opening items, server informed us that the kitchen no longer had potatoes (our side item which accompanied 3 of our brunches) and suggested salad as a substitute. We all agreed on the salad as a substitute. We actually waited a very long time between courses and when our dishes arrived they came with potatoes, no explanation as to why the sudden change. Especially since I liked the idea of the side salad and was looking forward to it.  Our waiter seemed distracted and overwhelmed luckily another server was able to assist us. Over all it's a great place, not quite so going in groups works, the brunch menu isn't pricey and with the exception of the quantity of slices in the French toast (which tasted good but my friend left hungry and felt cheated), I would go back again.",

There were 5 entrees to choose from which were obviously the cheapest ones they had.  I decided on the Croque Monsieur. It was on sliced bread with mornay sauce.  It was soggy and only tasted ok.  The only choices for dessert were sorbet or creme brulee . I got the sorbet.  It was good but nothing special.  There was also a tiny serving of house wine.  It seems to me that if you're offering a groupon to try to get more customers,  you would want to serve good food, not the mediocre offerings that were available.  My husband ordered a kobi beef dog off the regular menu and a coke. He really liked it and it was just $21. I would rather have skipped the dessert and the wine and gotten something that tasted good.",

    "text": "4&1/2 stars rounded up.  This review is for a group dinner. Limited menu and the party had an Imperial of wine, brought in by the host. An Imperial is 6 standard bottles. The restaurant decanted the wine and kept the carafes filled with leaving the sediment in bottle. They were respectful with the wine. I would return for that alone. I would like to explore their selection of wine. Their food was as good as their caring for the wine; except that my Filet was a little overdone. The Tomato Salad was flawless. The sides were great. The Creme Brulee  was good with a lighter hard sugar cover on top. It was appropriate.  As it is hot at this time of year they could have been quicker with the water refills. The real ding was because the fan over the table was not working.   That being said would I return? YES Would I recommend Marche Bacchus to friends?  ABSOLUTELY!!!!!",

    "text": "I was looking for a nice place to take the GF for lunch.  A quick search on the yelp app revealed the Marche Bacchus (MB).  Yelp makes these things possible.  We arrived in at the commercial center in the middle of Desert Shores and located MB with ease.  In the door we walked and right into wine shop located the front of the business.  Seats were available and off we went to our table.  I thought about picking up a bottle to compliment the lunch, but decided against it.  We thought we see what the menu had to order.  We were seated in an most excellent spot right next to an open window looking at the lake.  Paddle boat people, ducks, swans, and turtles.    The GF ordered a glass of wine. I ordered a Chimay Grand Reserve.  The bottle being of a large variety also brought with it an ice bucket,  For an appetizer we shared a French onion soup.  It went great with the complimentary bread.  The GF ordered up a Rosemary Chicken and Asparagus salad.  I ordered up the Brie Cheese Bacon Burger with fries.  Be advised they do not have Ranch here.  When the food arrived we found it to very good.  We very much enjoyed our lunch as we sipped our drinks and laughed at the turtles.  Even better than the turtles is the people watching.  Old dudes with young chicks and the house wives of Summerlin.  Better than TV!  I can't wait to check this out again!",

When you walk into the restaurant, you really are not in the restaurant. The 1st room is the wine shop, huge selection of exotic and very pricey and hard to find wines. I did have the fortune to meet one of the owners, and she's definitely a wine enthusiast, and possibly a botox enthusiast as well.   We got a seat right by the window, and a nice sweet lady came to take care of us. She was easily one of the best waitresses I've had: super attentive, sweet, patient, and anticipated our needs before we even opened our mouth to ask. Very lovely and very intelligent. I got the foie gras appetizer which was nothing short of amazing, both in flavor and presentation. The crab salad was very fresh, light and very refreshing on a hot summer day. I got the duck entree, and that was cooked perfectly and flavored just right. Last but not least, the chocolate lava cake was so pretty, and tasted even better.   Definitely recommend, and for sure check out the wine shop.",

We had a pre fixe menu for Mother's Day which included a complimentary glass of champagne which was a nice touch! We had the smoked salmon, rib eye medallions, and the creme brulee with bread pudding. Our orders came out fast and were made to perfection. The rib eye was my favorite and was served on a bed of broccolini and mashed potatoes. Our server was Vincent and he went above and beyond to make sure we had a perfect dinner.

We've been here several times (never our idea) and we are always disappointed. Ordered the lobster cavatelli and I would be surprised if there was half a cup of food in the bowl. There were 6 small pieces of lobster claw meat clearly placed on top to control quantity and it was fishy and rubbery. $24 the flank steak frites was not cooked to order, very rare, and my husband did not want to send it back. The fries were cold. $44 The $8 glass of wine was a measured pour - under portioned by other standards. Everything is al a carte.

I was ordering a $21 glass of wine and I simply asked him to ask the bartender when the bottle was opened. Three times I asked him politely to do so. And he refused to do so telling me his canned response that they use a system that makes it fresh no matter how long the bottle has been opened. I don't care what system you use. I asked when the bottle was opened and I asked you to ask the bartender. I can choose not to purchase it if I don't like the answer. He literally told me \"you aren't listening to me\" in a nasty voice and refused to ask the bartender. He then grabbed the menus off the table! And he walked away! We had been there less than 10 minutes. So I and my dining partner walked out. I previously ate here monthly and my dining partner eats there several times a month. That will be the last for both of us. This jerk was the manager. If that's who the owners put in charge, I have no interest in patronizing their establishment.",

    "text": "We came here yesterday for lunch. Having been before with a large group of ladies, I knew the food was good, so I was keen to impress my visiting family with a great meal in a very pretty setting.  The hostess who greeted us seemed dissatisfied that we hadn't booked and asked if we'd like to sit outside, I'd said yes as it was a nice day, she offered us a table in front of a very dirty fire and standing fan, there were insects on the fire and floor and the view was poor, I'd spotted a nicer table and enquired if it was reserved, she responded with 'yes it is, because it's a nice day they called to reserve'.  I found her very rude from the off and not once did she smile or seem at all pleased.  We were quickly offered water, that was the only part of the service that was prompt.  We sat for over 15 minutes whilst other guests who arrived after us, were seated, served drinks and menu orders taken. Eventually our waitress took our order, we had to prompt her to take a drinks order. One in our party ordered a Chianti, she said they didn't serve Chianti, my guest pointed it out to her on the menu, she wrote it down and said no one had ever ordered one before!!  We waited yet another 20/25 minutes for our food to arrive, mussels, turkey sandwich and lobster crepe, but the order had been taken down wrong and a lobster croissant arrived. The server checked the order with us and we reiterated that it was a lobster crepe not croissant that had been ordered, he apologized and said it wouldn't be long to rectify the order and placed the other two items down. The mussels were cold, and the chorizo looked old and crumbly, like dog meat. The turkey sandwich was toasted but cold also, as were the fries, which were frozen not fresh made.  The atmosphere here is very snobby and it feels like if your face doesn't fit you're not going to get the best service. My money is as green as everyone else's and all customers should be treated equally. The staff need some serious training, the place needs a good clean up. The bar at the entrance has boxes stacked everywhere, it looks dark and unkempt. The patio area canopy needs some serious attention as do the windows, they were filthy.  I was thinking of spending my anniversary here this month but after this visit we won't be returning.  We walked out, something I rarely do, but cold food and bad service don't deserve good custom.  I hope the owners are aware of the serious problems here, they need to make some changes if they intend on keeping this business afloat.  We went to Brio at Tivoli and had great service and hot tasty food. Save your money and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Two BAD Visits in a row!  Save your money!  Came here two weekends in a row for lunch.  Both visits had terrible service and mediocre food.  Last weekend, we stopped in for an early lunch.  We were the only table in the place until another group got seated after us.  We came to enjoy BOTH the ambiance of the water and food.  The service was bad.  We ordered wine when we sat down which never came.  It showed up with our food which was ordered well after the wine.  The explanation was the the \"hostess got busy and she's our bartender.\"  Since there was no one there, it seems she was busy with people attending the FREE wine tasting they have.  That's great but,  what about us PAYING customers?  Today, it was a birthday and we tried again thinking it would be better.  IT WAS WORSE THAN LAST WEEKEND.  We had three people in our party, one person finally got their wine after 15 minutes.  Again, the other 2 DRINKS NEVER CAME.   After 20 minutes, our waiter said, \"he'd check on it.  Someone is making them now, I think.\"  Did we get our drinks?  Nope.  I got up and spoke to the manager asking if we could please get our drinks (no food order had even been taken yet.)  Again, this excuse was the same as last week's excuse, \"\"hostess got busy and she's our bartender.  I'm helping here out now.\"     And today's food?  We only ordered an appetizer and no more.  Why?  The bread was ROCK HARD and the 6 grapes we had were shriveled  with BROWN STEMS.  Awful.    As a manager, you need to recognize when you are short staffed and get the right help.   He needs to pay attention and stop making excuses for poor service and focus before losing more customers.   WHY ARE YOU HAVING A HOSTESS DOUBLE AS A BARTENDER?   Get a dedicated bartender or an extra staff person that does your drink orders!   At $16 for a glass of wine you are charging LV Strip prices ~ you can afford proper staffing.    This isn't about a drink or food, it's about plain and simple customer service and appreciating your customers.  There are WAY too may places to eat in this town to put up with this crap.",

They were attentive to the group and provided excellent service. The food was overall delicious. We had two starter choices: panzanella and tomato soup. I had the panzanella which had tomatoes, onion, olives, and feta. Overall I found it to be underwhelming. I did try the tomato soup that someone else ordered. It was tasty and reminded me of blush pasta sauce. We had three entree choices: filet mignon, chicken, and salmon. Most of us ordered the filet. It was cooked perfectly to order and the sides complimented it well. My husband ordered the chicken and ended up sending it back for the filet. The chicken was dry and did not have enough sauce. The two desserts were both good too. We had the creme brulee and the tiramisu. Both were very authentic and delicious. I would recommend this restaurant for a special occasion - it's beautiful and the food is very good.",

If you are in need of a nice sit down, take your time brunch with a view, this is the place to be. I ordered 3 poached eggs in this wine reduction sauce of mushrooms, ham bits and shallots.  My taste buds were in heaven!  Hubby ordered the steak and eggs with potatoes which were just as tasty. And of course we had apple crumb with vanilla ice cream for dessert. This bistro has many different types of wine, (I had an Italian Pinot Grigio with my meal). It was over 100 degrees but very comfortable in the outside seating under the shade with mist spraying.  Beautiful big lake with swans, carp and these cute little turtles. The food, ambiance, and waiter all made it a 5 star restaurant!",

The fans were broken, the misters were not available yet. On top of that the servers were so busy they couldn't refill our water glasses. It's Vegas, it's May, at 600 dollars for our table you really should be prepared.  Our table we reserved was 30 minutes late to be seated. It would be a hour before we would eat our first plate. Which seemed mass produced standardized at best.  The cherry on top was when the hostess entered the bathroom and ejaculated an expletive upon finding both bathroom stalls were occupied. While this would not normally bother me in the slightest. What she did not know was that I was waiting for my 5 year old niece in the stall. The behavior of their entire staff was manic and panicked. I am sorry to write such a poor review for a place I so dearly loved. But then again Marche Bacchus let me down too.",

We had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation, seated in a smoky dining room (something had burned in the kitchen) giving some of us headaches and freezing us with the door being open on the first cold day of the year. The staff seemed totally disorganized and preoccupied. We waited 10+ minutes for mamossas, another 5 minutes for waters, and then another 10 minutes for server to take orders (40 minutes into our visit). Ou server knew we had a Groupon voucher, not sure why he didn't offer to bring out cheese and charcuterie platters after serving drinks - that was a given. Instead we sat waiting for entree orders to be taken. Entrees came out before finishing our cheeses, etc. Sadly, it was just annoying all around. It wasn't the most pleasant experience. The stars are for great tasting food. Everything was delicious! Not sure if we'll go back though.",

We ended up with an outdoor table with a plastic curtain right next to us which constantly disturbed our meal. Did I mention we were one of the first diners of the day? Oh well. Should have realized that the menu would be limited to an Easter Brunch menu. That was my fault. No problem except I had no idea it was Easter looking at the menu. No lamb selections. No ham selections. Very disappointed in the lack of creativity of the menu at a normally very crafty culinary team.  A table for 2 took 2 1/2 hours to complete service. How do they make money to pay their staff at this rate? The food was just ok. Not a wow factor. No coffee offered with dessert. All this for $132 + tip ($155 total). Don't think this experience or food was worth the amount on this tab.",

    "text": "On Sunday my husband and I went to a picture perfect lakeside brunch in Desert Shores at Marche Bacchus. I am falling in love with this commecial center's 'restaurant row' each time we go, as I find it a much needed escape from our natural desert landscape (the desert has it's beauty, but the life that flourishes in and amongst this artificial oasis is a refreshing change). The beautiful weather this time of year certainly makes this particular outdoor eatery more appealing, but the food makes it worthy of a return no matter the season.  Although I have eaten at Marche Bacchus a handful of times within the past few years, I hadn't been back recently because the old chef seemed to let things slip. The new chef, however, has revived this hot spot for traditional French cuisine, and a decorator has stepped in and made the cafe/wine store into a place you can easily spend a few hours in. Since this location is becoming a popular place to host weddings, today we tried something old and something new, something cold and something, well, pink.  There were actually two something olds, the french onion soup ($8) and the moulles frites (steamed mussels with fries, $15). The French onion soup was served traditionally in a brown and white clay bowl textured by crisp gruyere baked around its edges. The veal stock was rich and seemed salty at first, but as the soup began to cool from its bubbling state the flavors emerged revealing a layer of acidity we intially mistook for overseasoning. It was definitely one of those dishes that gets better and better the more you eat. Sadly, however, the moules weren't as impressive. Although the mussels were cooked well, the broth was weak and didn't coat them enough to give any additional flavor. It was served in the appropriate cast iron vessel, but this pot was really too small to allow you to get the liquid in each bite. The frittes on the other hand were teriffic, but I would have preferred a traditional aoli as an accompaniment rather than plain old American ketchup.  The something cold was the Lobster Avocado Croissant ($12), which was incredibly difficult to find any fault with. The buttery and golden brown croissant was light (can light be used to describe a croissant?), but despite this was not overpowered by the lobster filling. There is no mayonnaise used in the salad, according to the waiter, making the dish all the more impressive as there is a definite creaminess to it. The salad was composed of big chunks of lobster bound by less desirable (yet still tasty) knuckle meat enhanced with crunchy, finely chopped celery and shallots. It was served with a delicately dressed salad that upped the fresh factor and colored the plate.  The something new was the sake Bloody Mary ($9.50) Ian had, which rivaled that of Hash House for the best in town (note: they don't use vodka at March Bacchus because they only have a wine and beer license). This one doesn't have the jalapeno stuffed olives and tangy cornichons, but it does contain an ample amount of real horseradish that gives an unexpected punch, differing greatly from the usual tobasco and black pepper that give heat to most (think spiked cocktail sauce). The something pink was my Kir Royale ($8) which was a relative bargain but a touch on the sweet side for my taste. It didn't matter though, becuase the color looked so beautiful in contrast to the background of blue sky and green palm fronds (see below).  To top off the lovely meal, the service was wonderful. Our waiter even brought over a heat lamp to combat the mild, cool breeze without us having to ask. I could have done without the artificial strand of sunflowers that wrapped the bridge, but I guess the whole scene is fairly artificial so it didn't bother me too much. The ambiance actually adds tremendously to the meal, because despite the faux flowers and what not, you are surrounded by running water, several turtles, large carp, and a beautiful black swan. If you come here I insist you pick a day when the weather is just right and make the most of the money you're spending by lingering over a deliciously beautiful afternoon.",

The ambiance is exceptional, whether on the patio overlooking the tranquil lake, or inside the beautiful dining room.  The wait staff is professional and sees to your every need.  The food is the best to be had in Las Vegas - and that is saying a lot. I am particularly partial to the braised short ribs (I dream of them) and my husband loves the filet, which is the best in town.  I realize that caviar is not on everyone's bucket list but, if you have not tried it with a glass of champagne, you are really missing out!  Wine, at every price point, is available for purchase in the adjacent wine shop and, even if you are a wine novice, the wait staff (most of whom are working on or have achieved one of the sommelier levels) can make an educated recommendation, never making you feel uncomfortable in the process.  If you have not tried Marche Bacchus, please make an effort to join them for lunch or dinner (my favorite).  Oh yes, and don't forget to try their desserts.  They are not to be missed (especially with a glass of dessert wine, perhaps a port?).  This is not the place for the \"woohoo\" crowd, but a place for a quiet, civilized dinner.",

I thought the food was going to improve with the change of ownership and chef, but that does not seem to be the case.  On top of that, the lousy service was distracting and annoying and the food simply did not justify the high prices.  I'll be back to shop in the wine store because they have an excellent and colorful selection.  Otherwise, I will continue my frustrating hunt for a great, local restaurant in the northwest.",

We got our reservations at 11 am which was perfect since no one else was there on the patio, granted it was a hot summer day. It was worth it however to be secluded to enjoy one of the most romantic lunches/meals. We picked out a wine, chilled Rose, which was just the perfect touch to our Soft Shell Crab Po Boy. The waiter was the best and he added to the romantic feel of the whole place. It was essentially perfect :) just try to bare the heat and go early!",

    "text": "I love this little french wine shop and bistro.  This place is unique and is the best place I have found to have a romantic evening hands down.  It is probably the best specialty wine shop in town too.  You walk in to a great fairly large wine shop, it's not the cheapest place but you get fantastic wines.  I mean you'll spend less at trader joe's but you get a larger more upsclale selection, typically they have french and california wines and I would guess 80% of them are between 16-50 bucks and most of the stuff you don't see everywhere else.  For an extra 10 bucks you can have the wine with your meal, so for 35 bucks you get a real good wine with dinner and for 50 to 60 you get a great wine that would probably cost you well over a hundred easy anywhere else.    The food here is well made french bistro food, it's not \"oh my god amazing life changing\" but I have had some things here that have been awesome and everything else has been real tasty to say the least.  They do have an apple crumb dessert that is awesome and i once had scallops with fresh pea risotto that I still remember as one of the best things I have ever tasted (seasonal).  Typically we get a bottle of wine, snack on a cheese platter or appetizer and split an entree or something for well under a 100 bucks.       On an evening when we have nice mild weather you must go and sit on the patio overlooking the \"lake\" and have a nice dinner.  Even when it isn't ideal they have misters or heaters or you could always sit inside that is also still real nice.   The staff has always been great.  We have been going here for years but recently we have been going more often and the waitress we typically have is very friendly and remembered us by our second time around.    Saturdays they have wine tastings also and if you register your email they send you updates about different events that they have often.  5 stars not because the food is as good as is gets but the place is definitely as good as is gets.",

In any case, went here for a late lunch, and had help selecting a nice French Cabernet to accompany our meal.  We started with the cheese plate, which they have never disappointed us with. They do know their selections and we were quite happy with the choices. (especially a nice blue cheese)  went on with an order of escargot, a simple but well prepared dish. DON'T let them take away the plate.....the butter/garlic/parsley sauce perfect for the bread! YUM  tried the duck confit salad and seared foie gras again, this place has not disappointed foie gras was nicely prepared, always love it here duck confit salad was nice, nothing spectacular, but hey, its a duck salad!  last dish we tried was the forbidden rice with chicken....I really enjoyed the richness of this dish, went nicely with our wine!  again, sorry if I haven't let you all in on this place yet, it is always our favorite and had never failed to disappoint us!",

First time we came here was for their Sunday brunch and their steak and eggs are awesome. Second time was for Mother's day and their lobster salad was phenomenal. Lunch date one time and I had their eggplant parmigiana gratin, delish. And we took some family for dinner here as well and had their red wine braised beef, omg. Other than the food, they also have varieties of wine. And I believe they offer wine tastings too..  while I was waiting for some other people for my party, I was listening to their wine expert and that was fun. Kid friendly place too. Will definitely coming back to try the whole menu.",

    "text": "Came here for surprise birthday dinner. We had a table on the water and it was beautiful but the mister was leaking right behind my chair. Visibly an easy fix but nothing was done about it. We ordered a bottle of wine and the waiter returned to inform us that they were out of that particular bottle which I found disappointing as it is also a wine store. We Had the octopus and clam chowder as apps. Octopus portion was small and lacking in the flavor department. The clam chowder was the best I've ever had. For entrees we had the ciopinno and braised beef ravioli. Both not very good, lacking flavor, and small portions. This was specifically annoying because we had asked the waiter about portion sizes since we were considering ordering a third entree to share and he assured us they were large portions \"unlike most French restaurants\". My pasta was BEYOND al dente, and the plating was sloppy. Wipe the rim people! It's not that hard. Complimentary gelato with a very crunch cookie for my birthday was nice to photograph. The sun set and swarms of these tiny bugs started circulating around our table. I was assured they weren't mosquitos but it definitely wasn't a good end to the night. Our waiter was nice but we definitely waited long periods of time for assistance. They don't check on you very often. I spilled a glass of water on Our very small table and we had to use our dinner napkins to clean it up ourselves. Our waiter didn't show up till about 10-15 min later. Usually when something like this happens swarms of waiters appear to help you and bring you new napkins or utensils. The Highlight of this meal was the guy playing live music. He was amazing.",

    "text": "One of the best off the strip restaurants I've been to in this town. What the exterior lacks in curb appeal (it's located in a dated strip mall with a non-descript facade) the interior more than makes up for it with a quaint, romantic atmosphere not found elsewhere in Las Vegas. It's two biggest selling points: a wine shop and a patio overlooking a lake.  I love the wine shop! With several rows of wines displayed, there are plenty of varietals to choose and a wide range of prices for both the big spenders and the penny pinchers (I'm somewhere in between). So, after you check in at the host stand -- which is by the front door at the cash register -- peruse their wine selection and take it to the table with you. They'll just add the wine to your dinner check, plus a ten dollar corkage fee.  There's a small indoor dining area, but the best place to sit is on their patio. During the winter it's enclosed and has heat lamps so you'll be able to dine there year-round. Don't expect a breathtaking view. We're not talking about one of the Great Lakes. It's in a desert, after all, so the body of water is fairly small. But the overall experience and atmosphere is one that is unique to the city.  The food is very good. The menu is on the conservative side, with items that will be familiar to most everyone. It's French-inspired American food that's executed extremely well.  The ahi and bacon app ($15) was a nice mix of flavors and textures with its pickled pineapple, glazed bacon, chive and chili oil. It's a small dish, with two seared slices of tuna and one thick cut of bacon, but tasty, nonetheless.  For entrees my wife had the mushroom risotto ($18) -- a large and perfectly seasoned portion served in a shallow bowl. I went with the braised short rib ($28) -- a large, tender slab of beef sitting on a generous helping of blue cheese mashed potatoes and topped with crispy shallots. Neither dish stood a chance... we devoured both with nothing left behind.  We ended the meal with a delicious bread pudding ($8) -- freshly baked to order and served with cinnamon rum sauce. Served in a large ramekin, it's good enough for three, maybe four people.  The service was professional and courteous without being too overbearing.   The prices were excellent. With our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> gift certificate we ended up paying about $130 total. That's a far cry from what we would normally spend on the Strip for a similar meal. With its decidedly anti-Vegas ambiance, this place is a hit for any special occasion.",

Their food is absolutely good. I cannot say it is a high-end gourmet, but I loved every bite I took and we enjoyed our meal to the max. You go to a place like this to see Vegas from a different angle and not necessarily from the strip or viewing a parking lot.  So why only three stars? The idea of seating on the Lake is to get fresh air. As we walked out to the patio where is the only and best place to sit in order to get the best experiences of the restaurant, it smelled horrible. The entire patio smelled like standing water or like a huge fish tank that has never been cleaned. When we looked up at the covered patio it looked as though it is full of mold and smelled like it. When we looked straight towards the glass windows that were shut closed --- hundreds of mosquitoes covered the glass from the inside of the restaurant!! We asked the server to open the window and as she pushed against it, all the mosquitoes flu around the restaurant (needless to say we felt the tropical atmosphere LOL) then a rustic sound from the window but finally it was open. Only then, we saw the trash outside the window floating on the water against the rocks. It was a Friday afternoon and we were planning to stay for the sunset, we left when we were done and saw the sunset from home. I wish they would have fixed this throughout the winter so it would have been perfect now for the nice evenings...",

    "text": "The easiest way to get here is to go to Lake Mead and Mariner. Make the turn onto Mariner where Buca di Beppo is, then look for Regatta and make a left. You'll be surprised to find such a beautiful wine store and restaurant overlooking their own lake, across from other beautiful houses and condominiums.   They have a heated patio and outdoor seating. The hostess, Tina, really wants you to sit outside. I have an inkling it's because there's a different server for outdoor seating and she needs to help the server out, but we opted for indoor seating and ended up with Laurel as our server.  She was very professional, nice, prompt, and sweet. She knew her menu well and was even able to provide vegetarian options to someone from another table.   The wine store is beautifully lit, has some of the awards they have received, and is a great deal for people who like to dine with wine, because normally wines are marked up 300% at a fine-dining establishment, but if you dine with Marche Bacchus and buy a bottle of wine and get it served there, the mark-up is generally only around 30%.   I've been to Marche Bacchus twice, once last year and once yesterday. Both times, the food was solid, and the service was friendly and professional.   This time around, I ordered the   Escargot: sea snails with melted herb butter. \"Monte au beurre,\" right chef? You can never have too much butter. It was great for dipping the fresh bread they brought us as well.  Moules Frites: There aren't too many first bites where I wish I could have another first bite of that same exact bite. This was one of those rare moments. My palate was so lucky as to taste this mussel washed over with this great sauce. The taste of alcohol and butter and the freshness of the mussels really created a mezcla of bliss for a moment in time. Then I quickly went back for more. The fries are really crispy, not made in-house, probably come from a large brown bag, but the starch they battered the fries in really made the fries very crispy. Delectable! No ketchup for me!  Half-Pound Burger: Uberly soft bread, perfect medium-temperature patty, melted cheese, fresh and slightly pickled rings of onions crowned the patty, and again the same delicious and crispy fries. How could I ever be a vegetarian?  Rum Bread Pudding: Order this 30 minutes in advance. Last year, my server forgot to order it as he was supposed to time the ordering. This year, Laurel made sure to remember and even let us know when she ordered it, right around before the entrees were going to come out. When the bread pudding came out, there was a side of cinnamon apple sauce that went quite well with the bread pudding. I must add that the bread pudding was not as moist as bread puddings should normally be. Bread pudding was traditionally made with left-over bread and needed to be moist because it was supposed to be drenched in custard as that would help the bread soften. Of course, it was still very yummy.   Last year, I also had their charcuterie. From what I recall, the charcuterie had a very nice mix of pear, apple, candied walnuts, and different cheeses and thinly sliced meats. My eyes couldn't help but glance over to the 11-top next to me when the platters of fromage came to their table. There were apricots, pickles, cheeses, and slices of apples on their plates. Everything looked really delicious, even as I was ready to leave.   I am excited about my next visit to Marche Bacchus and hope it won't be another year before I come back.",

The small-plate menu is perfect after a long day on the job... together with top-shelf wines at 50% discount. The bar is surrounded by boxes of amazing well-selected wines, adding to the 'wine bar' appeal. My husband is a former winemaker (San Diego) & loves the selections. JUSTINE makes it a great experience-- another reason we love coming to Marche' Bacchus! Prompt, friendly service from this lovely lady*You cant go wrong with this great menu and HH prices every weekday, 4-6PM. Hope to see you there:-)",

    "text": "Marche Bacchus is located in a \"neighborhood mall\" kind of setting. When my party arrived at this place we were hesitated if we should go in or to go somewhere else. We stayed at the original plan to give this place a try and I am very happy we did.   I guess it is not duck season. They made some minor changes to the menu in oppose to the one on their website. Duck Confit Fettuccine was no longer on the menu. We ordered the chicken fettuccine, the lobster avocado croissant with ceasar salad, turkey panini and french onion soup. We also ordered some ice tea and some black-current wine. The wine menu has a huge selection with the scores for the wines. You can ordered as little as 3oz for the wine available.   The restaurant just opened when we arrived at 11ish. A gentleman was cleaning the patio and feeding the duck in the pond. My cousin got excited and went to take pictures of it. The gentleman was very kind and offered my cousin to feed the duck. Our food already arrived at that time... But seeing this attracted me and my sister to go feed the ducks too! Since we are no longer legally allowed to do this in the parks in San Francisco, we were so excited and had so much fun. The gentleman brought in more french baguette for us to feed the ducks. Many birds came by aside of the water duck, pigeons and swans started to appear once we continue feeding.   We enjoyed the food. I think that the french onion soup was a bit too salty. Other than that, the black-current wine was one of the best wine I had and the view was spectacular. Ice tea was very good since it was freshly brewed. Everyone in the restaurant were really nice people and our party all had a great experience.",

I loved the outdoor seating- nicely designed with a casual but sophisticated look that invites diners to relax and stay awhile. Someone described it as \"intimate\" and \"romantic\" and I would have to agree- a great spot for a date, or even to come by yourself!  The roof helps keep the direct heat of the sun from frying you but the space opens up to a pretty view of a small body of water populated by ducks and geese (and fish?) and lined with cute homes.    They must have updated the menu since my visit, as I now don't see the upscale version of the grilled cheese sandwich that I'd enjoyed immensely.  While the food is creative, tasty and somewhat pricey, I really would patronize this spot for the atmosphere. The waitstaff are friendly and the place is simply gorgeous.  I highly recommend this place.",

Our server for the evening was French through and through and quite witty, and not a hint of snobbery- not to mention exceedingly skilled at his job.   The Escargot, though recommended with bread by our server, was delicious alone, rich and soft with just the right amount of garlic to enhance its taste.  Now I have been here 4 or 5 times, 3 since the current owners have taken over, and they always recognize/ accomodate their regulars. Marche Bacchus is a unique experience in that you can browse a really incredible array of wines before dinner and enjoy them with your meal for a $10 corkage fee- which is waived on Mondays.   Excellent at any time of day, sitting outside is really a treat- And when it gets darker opt for the upper level patio as the lighting is optimal.  They have wonderful meat and cheese platters and some of the best Bread Pudding I have ever tasted- I literally order it in advance because it does take some time to make and I always want it.   This would be the perfect for Romantic Date Ambiance, complete with impeccable service and all for such a great price.",

This visit was such a disappointment and I get increasingly frustrated when you go to a restaurant with a promo and they treat you like inferior customers in light of the coupon...I'm sure they expect a lower bill and lower tip but when they start with 'attitude' and the service is below par...well, the lower tip just follows! We were seated outside by request and it was very busy and somewhat hot!  Love their bread so when they brought the ONE little loaf it was gone immediately...the waiter came and we asked for more bread to go with the Charcuterie platter (which was part of the Groupon) and asked for the platter with meat and cheese to which he replied \" that's what you're getting!\" We actually DID want more to drink than the one mimosa that came with the cert but he took all the menus right away, never offered the mimosa special or anything else to drink although we did order a glass of wine each to enjoy with our meals. We both had the Benedict's, they were pretty good but the best was the charcuterie platter that we would've enjoyed more with bread, even though we asked two more times it never came. The discount with the Groupon was really NOT that much and the fact it seemed to create such an attitude was annoying. Might try it again but hoping it was the day, the waiter...some other reason why we felt unwelcome and uncomfortable.",

One server for 15 people - just not enough.  One of our diners didn't get his dinner (just steak) until most of the others were finished with their dinners.  Of course, that may not have been the servers fault.  Who knows. Now the food.  Not bad, just not good enough to justify the prices.  Seared scallops - $31 for 3, yes that's three, scallops and some broccolini.  They were good - but let's get real!!! I won't go into the rest.  While no-one complained about their food, no-one thought it was great, which was a real shame.  I remember Marche Bacchus years ago when it was THE place to go in the area.  Beautiful ambiance, wonderful food - everything you wanted in a restaurant.  Still pricey, but worth it!  I also won't go into the service.

    "text": "Marche Bacchus is a hidden gem in the desert of Las Vegas.  Situated right next to a lake, this restaurant and wine shop is a fabulous place to enjoy a leisurely lunch (or dinner) with excellent company.  For our dining enjoyment, my companion and I shared the Bacchus Grazing Platter ($18, Selection of Imported Cheese, Meats, Lobster Salad, Smoked Salmon, Olives, Fruit, Onion Marmalade served with French Baguette); Salad Bacchus ($8, Goat cheese Croutons, Mesclun salad, Pine Nuts, Beurre Rouge); and the Lobster Avacado Croissant ($9, Celery, sliced Tomatoes and Lemon Vinaigrette).   The Bacchus Grazing Platter was a fabulous choice!  They offered three cheeses - brie, blue, and morbier.  The morbier was absolutely delicious, but the blue was a bit too crumbly for my choice.  This is an excellent choice if you're ordering wine too.  (We had to pass, it was our first meal of the day.)    The Lobster Avocado Croissant was stuffed with lots of lobster salad.  Very yummy, but I would have wanted a bit more avocado in my sandwich.  (It is called a Lobster Avocado Croissant after all.)  A side of Caesar salad accompanied this sandwich.    Last to arrive was the Bacchus Salad.  After already dining on the wine platter and the sandwich, we could have done without the salad.  My companion did enjoy the goat cheese croutons, but the salad was average.    The great thing about this place is that you can go through their wine selection (they are a wine shop after all), pick a bottle of wine and enjoy that bottle with your meal.  (There's a $10 corkage fee.)    Service was okay.  Our waiter was average.  He never bothered telling us the daily special or anything.  The waitress who took over his shift was much better and a lot more pleasant.  I could hear her interactions with the other diners was much more impressed with her customer service skills than our waiter.  And of course, please sit outside when dining here, especially for lunch.  With a shaded area and a mist, it's not hot out and the view of the lake makes it a fabulous place to just sit, relax, eat, drink, and just immerse yourself in the company of your dining companion(s).  It can easily be a romantic spot if you let it be, or go with friends and enjoy a couple of glasses of wine.  They are soon to be offering wine tasting events in the near future which I would definitely be interested if I were in the area more often.  Eat, drink, and be merry!  They are open for Sunday brunch (10 am to 3 pm); Lunch (10:30 am to 4 pm) and Dinner (4:30pm-10pm).  (Check out the photos of our meal above!)",

The food was good; the charred octopus appetizer was a bit bland, the duck was excellent, the portions were good size for dinner. Dessert was excellent; the creme brulee was perfectly done, with a nice crust, not too thin or watery. Brunch was very good as well; the chicken & fries had perfectly cooked chicken, and the coffee was not too dark, not too light. Also, the wine selection was excellent, since the restaurant includes a wine store, you can pick a bottle from the store and take it straight to your table. I'll definitely be going back.",

When she was done with her phone call, we thought we were finally going to get our table. Instead, she started stuffing menus in a menu holder and then took another phone call. While she was doing that, my friends and I browsed through their wine selection to pass the time.  At some point, one of my friends asked her if they're open. After a 15-minute wait and almost as an afterthought, Tracy picked up 4 sets of menu and led us to our table. At this point, we already decided not to eat there. We declined and told her why. She was so indignant about being told that she was being discriminating. Worst customer service ever!",

Second when I asked for two children's menus and was only given one. When I asked for the other the so called manager Angelo  rudely responded \"do you want me to read it for you?\" One of the people in our party asked for salmon and when the food was being served we were told they no longer had salmon and had made crab instead without even giving us the option to choose something else!!! My husband ordered the bottomless mimosas and was only served two we had to get up from the table and serve ourselves!! After all of this we spoke with the manager and he could obviously care less and did not even try to make matters right!!  With so many great restaurants in the area I highly suggest going somewhere else and stay far away from here.",

The shelves on the wall were chipped and broken, the floor was dirty, and the canvas patio cover was disgusting. It was filled with dirt and dead leaves, with holes patched with old tape. The more I looked around, the worse it got. As we were leaving, we noticed the remodeled interior was also a mess, with visible plywood and glue where tiles were supposed to be. Hopefully they'll get around to remodeling the patio as well, or at least a power wash on the floors and windows. I used to love this place but I was just grossed out by the condition and probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Was originally going to Americana next door, but they were closing early for some reason. So we ambled over to Marche Bacchus.   For a Friday night, we found it easy to get a table with no reservation. We chose inside, though outside seemed fun with live music.   After sitting, we quickly ordered drinks. The jack and coke I got was as expected, my date enjoyed their version of an Olde Fashioned very much.   Easily our favorite dish was the Truffled Goat Cheese Napoleon. Layered Puff Pastry, pistachios, honey, arugula and Frisee were all perfectly balanced. The crunch and creaminess that is a hallmark of any Napoleon was a welcome sound for every bite. The goat cheese, pistachio and honey worked so well together, I'm surprised more places don't use it.   We also ordered French Onion Soup which was ok, nothing special. And a salad, that I forget details of, outside that it had pears in it. It was fresh and had a good crunch, though was also less memorable.   Finally, we shared the Lobster Cavatelli, which, in both of our opinions, was the definition of \"meh\". Each component was cooked well, but the recipe or the mixture was not great. It felt like it was impressed with Lobster being in the dish too much, which let the rest of the dish falter.   This is our first time here, and I have heard positive reviews in the past, so we may try again, but with a different line up...plus the Napoleon.",

I was reluctant to try it due to some of the low Yelp reviews, but I have to say, I couldn't disagree more with those negative reviews.   I had the lobster croissant and Caesar salad for Sunday brunch and the blackened salmon and goat cheese napoleon for a weekday lunch. Great food, excellent service, reasonably priced, and close to home. It actually felt like we were on vacation somewhere far away from Vegas.",

    "text": "This was my first time dining at Marche Bacchus. My boyfriend brought me here for dinner on a quiet Saturday. He's been here previously for a birthday brunch, as well as picking up wine. Anyway, we were pretty much in the mood to wine & dine, and that's exactly what we did with a 3 course meal.   The sun was setting as they were seating us at the patio right next to the fireplace. I was hesitant at first because it was soooo cold out there, but our server Vince kindly asked if I wanted the overhead heater to be turned on. I couldn't get over how beautiful the view was from where we were sitting (mostly because we don't see a lot of water in Vegas lol).  Appetizers: -Roasted Hudson Valley Foi Gras  -Chef's Selection of Artisan Cheeses  I must say, I wasn't sure how to feel about the Foi Gras. The flavors were definitely there, but I just think I wasn't used to the textures. It melts in your mouth & it was definitely interesting. On the other hand, I enjoyed the cheeses and the Chardonnay I ordered to pair it with.  *Vince kindly brought us other wines to taste. Very sweet of him*  Entrees: -Steak \"Frites\"  -Oven Roasted Grouper  I ordered the steak frites and it was delicious. The wagyu was cooked medium rare and was tender and juicy. I paired my entree with a Pinot Noir. My boyfriend ordered the Grouper and he says the flavors were perfectly balanced. He paired his entree with a Cab. Yummm!!   Dessert: creme brulee   As if we weren't full enough, our wonderful server Vince showed us the dessert menu and he recommended the creme brulee. I was a fan of the custard base, but I found the caramel on top to be too sweet for me. Still very good!   Overall, my first experience here was phenomenal. It was literally the perfect date night, from the atmosphere to the food and service. It was intimate and romantic. You definitely get what you pay for.  10/10 would recommend.",

Equally as great for  Sunday brunch with a group of friends for a lively way to end your weekend.  I have even had my office Christmas party here which was a great, fun time for all.   All the appetizers are delicious.  The duck entree pictured is one of my favorites.  The beet salad is excellent with all beets.  (Not like some places that serve all greens with one little beet. ) LOL.  Really I encourage all locals and visitors to give Marche a try.  You won't be disappointed.",

Before this last experience, my last visit to Marche Bacchus was probably about 15 years ago. This time I was participating in the Restaurant Week (prix fixe menu), so it is not like my food choice was exotic, and the place wasn't particularly busy. Still, I waited about 20 minutes for the wine and about 1 hour 15 minutes for the main course. The wine glass arrived dirty (looked like BBQ sauce fingerprints), the knife was dirty as well;  both were replaced but by then the experience was ruined. I don't think I will be giving Marche Bacchus another try.",

Our server was very friendly. The downside to this trip was that it took quite a long time to get our drinks and appetizers. Honestly, it was worth the wait. I ordered the fish and chips for my meal. It was extremely fresh but the fish was sooooooo small. The size was disappointing but the taste was delicious. Given the price, I thought the portion size would be larger. Like I shared above, the server was super friendly but he talked like he was in this upper class establishment that was almost humorous. Please talk normally. They provide complementary bread and butter which is very good. It was my husband's birthday and they prepared a great dessert to celebrate his day. It was a good experience; just a few adjustments to make this a True 5 star restaurant.",

Whipped potatoes and asparagus were to die for... don't even get me started on the chocolate lava cake. Wonderful experience! Beautiful ambiance. It was 100 out during dinner and we are outside and with the lake breeze we didn't even notice. They had  misters on outside on the patio when we first got there and our table was soaked ... they didn't need to be on but then before our bread and cheese plate came thankfully they went off the rest the time we were there. Otherwise I feel like our meal would of been soggy. All in all one of the best dining experiences I've ever had in Vegas. We will definitely be back!",

So...We told the server we would like to purchase a bottle of wine and asked for suggestions from their list. The server said you can go into the store and select a bottle of wine of your choice for purchase and then we will serve it to you.  But when we received our bill we had a corkage fee added to our bill. Seriously?  This was a bottle from your store that you basically sell at full retail AND then you charge a corkage fee.  It is only fair to make a profit once... Not twice.  And you should tell your customers in advance that a corkage fee will be applied to an \"ON SITE\" purchase. I would have brought a MUCH better bottle of wine for us to enjoy and paid your corkage fee.  SHAME ON YOU! We will not be back.",

I have also had and enjoyed their Lobster Salad Croissant with fresh tomatoes and avocado. The price point is fairly reasonable for the quality of the food and the wonderful views of the lake. During my pregnancy this was one of my favorite places to stop by for dessert in the evenings after my husband got off work and just unwind taking in the serenity of the lake and live music on certain nights while catching up on our day.

There were servers and cooks in the kitchen that glanced over at us a few times we make eye contact with them nothing was said. We continue to wait and wait some more and wait even more. Not ONE person that worked in that place said anything to us. We waited at the hostess stand for a good 5-7 minutes. Not one person in that kitchen even acknowledged us. I understand it isn't your job but you could've said \"hey we'll be right with you\" but all we got were looks. The only person who said a word to us was the gentlemen delivering their alcohol.

Marche also has a lovely wine shop that you walk though on your to the patio seating. They have a nice selection of French and US wines with several boutique vineyard options. Many grab a bottle on the way out, but the extensive wine list makes it just as appropriate to find the perfect bottle to pair with your meal. The staff is knowledgeable about their products resulting in some special pairings in my experiences.  The other reason that people typically find their way out to Marche is for Brunch. The brunch menu has plenty of solid options, but also includes the option of Bottomless Mimosas, Champagne or Kir Royale for $20. This bottemless route seems to be quite the crowd pleaser.

Before I could say anything the waiter saw it and offer to get me a new steak. My husband was through eating by the time my second steak came to the table. The second steak was so salty I could not even eat it.  We paid $180 for dinner for two and I was not even able to eat my dinner. We will not be returning.",

What is there not to like - Wine bar/shop, tables overlooking a lake with swans and ducks swimming, a fireplace, and covered outside patio (it was cold that day), and French food? I immediately fell in love with this place!  We came at a weird time (linner) so we were the only ones there. Obviously, we got our first pick on where to sit so we chose to sit next to the fireplace in the covered, outside patio overlooking Lake Jacqueline. Since we were the only ones there, service was very attentive.   Unbeknownst to us, we had an unexpected guest joining us. It was a bird (not sure what kind of bird). He/she was next to our table near the fireplace. My husband fed the little birdie some complimentary bread but our little restaurant pet left as soon as the bread stopped coming. Birdie also left a present for us on our table. Thanks!  After taking a while to decide what to order, we ordered one of my favorite beers (Blanche de Chambly), escargot persillade, beef tartare with soft poached egg, pappardelle cochon, lobster salad croissant, and a bread pudding. The food was good but I really, really enjoyed the bread pudding the best. Sadly, we didn't order any wine. I would definitely come back here to try the other apps, entrees, and wine.",

    "text": "I can't believe I sat lakeside, outdoors yesterday in the middle of February, while enjoying a fabulous meal with friends without freezing to death!  Yes, Marche Bacchus has an enclosed outdoor patio with a fireplace and heaters, yet the \"walls\" were clear so as not to obstruct the view of the lake. My friends and I showed up at 3:30, which is right in the midst of their light bite menu, so our dining options were very limited, just appetizers and salads.  Upon entering the restaurant, you will pass through their little wine shop. I always pick up a bottle in the store and bring it to my table to drink with my meal for a $10 corkage fee. Being the cheapo that I am, I always go for the cheapest, or shall I say least expensive bottle that I can find. I mean, it's always good, right?  We ordered escargot, which was amazing in a delectable garlic butter sauce - it reminded me of my favorite shrimp scampi. Next came the asparagus soup, which had the consistency and appearance of Gerber \"peas\" baby food, but luckily the soup had a wonderful flavor and the bacon and chives sprinkled on top made it that much better.  The Crab Louie Salad could have had more crab meat on it as I barely tasted any. A large amount of avocado is sliced on top and a French type dressing and capers rounds this salad out nicely.  For dessert, we ordered the bread pudding which was out of this world. I think I'd go back here just for a glass of wine and bread pudding. My friends tried the flourless chocolate cake  (which by the way was gluten free) that was drizzled with a raspberry sauce and the creme brulee, which was prepared traditionally.",

    "text": "Hallelujah! Now here's something in my 'hood I've really had fun sinking my teeth into! Here is a place where the food outshines the service - I've gotten so used to the opposite in the area, I forgot what this felt like. Don't get me wrong, in a perfect world I'd have that elusive cohesion of service and food like I'm used to having at my usual haunts. Maybe after they get to know me a but here that'll change for me too but so far the customer service just isn't worth mentioning. It's not bad, it's not good, it's just meh. The FOOD however really is special...  So far, beet salad, chicken sandwich, filet with mushrooms and jus with root veg and puree, but the piece de resistance (too lazy to access French keyboard after 3 overdue reviews here so back off lol) is easily the goat cheese Napoleon! Holy *+!?#% that's good lol! Everything is beautifully presented but this tastes even better than it looks. The pastry layers are perfectly flaky yet hold their shape as you break into them, the creamy, dreamy light-as-a-feather goat cheese mousse nestled between, a restrained drizzle of honey and crushed pistachios for sweetness and texture, uh... Yes please!! The filet was buttery and cooked to temp perfectly, the ambience is nice and laid back a la mom ami G on strip and the view of the pond and sound of quacking ducks wading nearby is a welcome refuge in the area.  Two visits and a third planned already! If you were in doubt, pull the trigger already and thank me later. Note: many options on the lunch menu are not on dinner menu and vice versa but depending on the chef they can still accommodate ;).",

I don't believe our waitress Jane had taken any guest or food serving training what so ever! She kept addressing us by the type of food or drink we are ordering such as(Ms.Decafe) fought over to bring more sugar or cream for a party of 9 at the table, suggested I should try a butter knife to eat my steak when asked for a steak knife stating the meet is tender! Spilled the first order of food on my cloth up on serving it and didn't even bother to change my napkin, pushed down my daughters head to the table while placing plates where she thought it was funny, walks away while your placing a request talking over you stating her opinion, the list goes on... we felt like there was a camera and the whole thing was a prank! My question to the manager is, How can a restaurant with good reputation (at least until yesterday) hires a server like Jane and does not check on a table? No presence on your floor means anything can happen specially with a gem like Jane! We didn't make a scene or asked for any favor even left gratuity thinking of the runners who were trying to pick up the slack Jane was leaving behind. Please do take action to fix this as a good name like Marche Bacchus still can suffer a loss with bad service as this!!!",

There is nothing I like better than shopping in the wine store for a bottle of wine to have with dinner. My wife and I went to Marche Bacchus on Christmas Eve. I ordered the braised beef and my wife, the scallops. We had a bottle of Chilean Cab which was delicious. My beef was very good but my wife's scallops were gritty. Marche Bacchus was kind enough to remove her entree from the bill. Since it was Christmas Eve, we wanted dessert and a nice dessert wine to accompany. I looked in their glass refrigerators for a Sauterne or an Ice Wine or any dessert wine. A server offered to help in the search. Finally, he had to go to the manager who said they were out of Sauternes and Ice Wines. This store/restaurant has hundreds of different labels but not one Sauterne or Ice Wine? Hence, my mediocre score. The one bad entree happens and Marche Bacchus took care of that. Not have any dessert wines at all on Christmas Eve, very dissapointing.",

And also thank you <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> for the coupons for this place. (which i forgot to bring for the occasion, but it will come in handy when I go back)  I had set up for an early Valentine's Day and Anniversary dinner here with the bf on a Wednesday evening. Our reservation was at 5:30pm. I had planned it that way in hopes to see the sunset from the wonderful outdoor seating at the lake. But we were too busy admiring the restaurant, wine, and food to notice the sunset. But that's okay. I picked a wednesday for an early celebration because I figured it would be quieter and they had live jazz. Which the gentleman was very nice and I liked his music selection.  So when we arrived, the hostess was very welcoming. After getting seated (we were the only table in that section at the time), the server told us if we wanted a bottle of wine to pick any out and just bring it back to the table, and so we did. The pricing is great for bottles.  The restaurant is quite nice. When you enter through the double glass sliding doors, you enter into the wine shop and bar area. There is 3 sections of seating, 1 area inside and 2 areas outside.  So for the first course, we ordered the \"Bacchus\". It looked different from the one I saw in the pictures posted here... so I posted my own. It was quite nice, with the lobster salad, different cheeses, and other stuff that I don't remember the names of. It came with a small basket of bread, which definitely was not enough for us so we had asked for another basket. It was yummy.  For the main course I could not decide for a while because I really wanted to try everything! But I ended up ordering the Lobster Pot Pie because that is their signature item, and the original plan since I had looked at their menu before we went. And the bf went with Moule Frites.  I was slightly disappointed that the frites were just regular fries and not the thinner ones like what they have at Mon Ami Babi. Oh well, still good. The flavor of the moules (mussels) were great. They were cooked perfectly and you can really taste the wine through the dish. It was great to dip the bread in it also. Mmmm  And my pot pie. I was told it was similar to Michael Mina. It was very rich and had lots of spinach. Good amount of lobster as well. I liked that their was corn in it. Picture of the item has been posted. The small metal pot that it was served it was topped with a cute round pastry puff. Very flakey.   While enjoying the appetizer, the server had asked us if we wanted the bread pudding. It mentions on the menu it takes half an hour to make so I went ahead and ordered that too. Came out just in time. And the flavor of the dessert was amazing. It was very strong in scent and taste of cinnamon which I love. And there were raisins.  Overall a fantastic experience. A small menu, but with plenty of good options. I nice hidden gem.  And on the drive home I realized how close it was to our house, so I will definitely be going back soon. Probably to try their lunch cause it seems the items are completely different. And it would be a completely different feel. This place is great with service, food, and price. Worth a try :)",

I used to drive from rainbow and 215 at lunch to get that sandwich.

We were welcomed by a beautiful, friendly hostess (her name was Diamond) who explained how you can choose your bottle or order by a glass wine. Our server (Nicole) provided excellent insight on the menu and timed all of our courses perfectly. Even the general manager (Scott) came to check on us through out the night.  The food was delectable! We started with the escargot and the watercress organic salad.  For entrees, we had the special - bass over bok choy and the salmon. For dessert we shared the chocolate cake. Everything was cooked to perfection.",

If it's not your thing, I can see not being happy with your bill.   This is an over all review, which is the only reason I'm not giving 5 stars.  My husband and I have been long time patrons, we started when Marche was just a wine store and didn't even serve food.  We've said farewell to the previous owner and hello to the new.  We stood by during a rough transition (the loss of one star) and seen a new owner not afraid to make necessary changes and yet keep the spirit of the place.    If you are looking for True locals experience, something that makes Las Vegas unique and not in a mega-casino kind of way, then Marche Bacchus is a place to visit. Las Vegas needs more local businesses like this, so please visit them often!  PS...Marche if you are reading, sorry for the 4 stars, just want to put a little fear in you so you don't slip again. ;0)",

    "text": "I've been coming here for about 8 years and I believe it has gone down hill. I loved it so much, I had my daughter's baptism party here 2 years ago. After being slightly disappointed in the food then, I continued to come back thinking it was the large party that may have influenced the quality of the food that day.  My most recent visit on Feb 16th was less than stellar. After being seated, I went to choose the wine, and several bins were completely empty. Nothing I was intending to drink, but it still had a negative affect on my perception of their selection. Then, while  pondering over the cabs, a creepy type of guy who was sitting at the bar decided to give me a lessons on vineyards. I kindly asked if he was the manager and he said \"no.\"  I told him i had the kid at the table, so I didn't have time to really chat. I grabbed the closest wine which was more than i intended to spend, just to cut the conversation short.  I ordered fish and my husband ordered some type of pasta dish. The fish was rolled into some sausage type shape and was not good. I make better fish at home. It was bland. the side dish was decent but not nearly enough. My husband said his dish was ok. The wine ended up being very good, but after using my \"free\" dinner coupon I thought it was still overpriced for what we received. Our waiter left with the coupon and another server came back to tell us they were trying to figure it out. Then our original waiter came back a good 10 minutes later. Considering it took the 2 of them to work on it, I felt uncomfortable even using it. I have another but won't be coming back to use it. I may come back for wine and appetizers again since the view is nice, but I don't think i'll be back for dinner.  It's too bad, I used to really love this place.   On another note, the entertainment outside was lovely and my daughter enjoyed listening to the singer. She was very sociable and friendly. However, we didn't sit outside so only enjoyed her for 5 minutes before leaving. NIce touch.",

Thought I couldn't eat another bite - until they brought out the best Chocolate Cake I've ever had, with Salted Caramel Sauce.  Wow.    The view is beautiful.  We were looking at the water, watching black swans, ducks & geese swim around. There was even a mama swan with a couple little cygnets on her back. It was so very cool.....very relaxing.

    "text": "Being a passionate romantic, Marche Bacchus sparked the sweetness in me. Passing through Lake Jacqueline was a beautiful scenic sight before I turned right of a roadside curb to a clear view of a large sign of \"Marche Bacchus\" seen straight from the road curb. Parking was not a problem at that hour as it was 9:00 p.m. Walking along the parking lot to the entrance gave me a serene, quiet feeling, with no one else in sight but a few cars parked on the vicinity of this plaza of other businesses. The doors open to a receptionist/cashier desk to my left and all throughout is where the wine market shop is. Rows and rows of wine can be seen, some laid out on oak barrels and other wine bins. I was informed that the bistro and wine shop closes at 9:30 p.m. Nevertheless, my friend and I can still dine even after its closing time which is 9:30 p.m. As I was there first, I roamed a little around the wine \"market\" and saw the cozy indoor dining area of the bistro to the far right. I finally walked away from the wine bins to a doorway leading to table seating on the patio. I was \"enticed\" by the music coming from a guitarist who was playing sweet jazz music that have overtones of samba and latin rhythm by the patio door as I walked in the patio area, thus, setting my mood to a romantic, calm dining night. The patio overlooks the Lake Jacqueline. On a moonlit night it sparked the love fires in me as I sat on a table next to a fireplace. Tables were set on various angles, quite nice! One dining area had curtains set on poles flowing onto the patio floor. I gazed out to the lake...c'est magnifique! The moon reflects so beautifully on the lake's serene, calm waters. Amidst conversation, candles and cool night breeze, red wine was served on a choice both my friend & I both preferred. We were two of the other two guests remained seated at the restaurant that night till we left at around 11:00 p.m. .  For menu & wine market hours & bistro hours, visit their website <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marchebacchus.com&s=d04e46d062f7c8a81027675a0fbaa851b4ff20d48682d68a074fd94adede4336\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">marchebacchus.com</a>   My favorite from the menu is: \"Escargot Persillade\", \"Grilled Scottish Salmon\", \"Peppercorn Filet Mignon\", \"Lobster Pot Pie\", \"Grand Marnier Chocolate Cake\" with raspberry & \"Traditional Bread Pudding\" made with cinnamon & rum sauce....yummm, the best for me. I also recommend the \"Cheese Platter\" as a welcome beginning to start the palate.  Live entertainment on the patio on Wednesdays & Sundays from 6:00-9:00 p.m. Wine tastings on Saturdays from 11:30 a.m. -1:00 p.m. Friendly and good service from waitstaff and Hostess / Cashier. A selection of wine from the wine list or have any wine you choose from the market can also be served while you dine.  I like this French cuisine with a contemporary & New Orleans touch and French wine is at your fingertips to enjoy at a lunch, brunch, dinner, events, or party dining atmosphere that is oooh la la!   A sure favorite romantic escape of mine in one of Vegas' best neighborhood, Summerlin.",

Wine - The restaurant has coolers and crates of wine and champagne for every palate.  DIners can speak to the knowledgable staff, choose a new bottle to try with the meal, and take a few more home if its a winner.  Food - The lunch menu offers a few classics executed masterfully.  The French Onion Soup, Croque Monsiuer, and Tuna Sandwich are all perfect for a satisfying lunch.  The The Scottish Salmon with mushroom ragout on the dinner menu was cooked perfectly with the just the right amount of salt.  The Charcuterie, cheese and fruit tray is perfect to share for a few people to start the meal off.  For dinner, the Scottish Salmon is a perfect choice, cooked deliciously with just the right amount of salt.    View - Eat outside!  The covered patio overlooks a lake where some friendly wildlife can be seen.  Don't worry about the wind, the staff will pull down the clear covers and voila, its time to enjoy.  Don't miss this cozy French oasis.",

Waiter , greets us , again friendly .\" I'll be with you in just a moment\" . Several minutes went by and he took a drinks order . This really sums up the service we received. Very polite and knowledgable but just a little slow, often absent for 10 minutes plus , not horrible but it's a small-ish place. main course probably took 30 minutes to arrive , my wife and I were relaxing with nice wine and did mind but the kids were hungry. It was now 8-15 and the restaurant was half empty.  Food: very good . We had a sampler of 5 cheeses to begin . All good and fresh. My wife and I enjoyed trout with vegetables that was excellent . teenager had salmon , equally good and the little guys enjoyed chicken , fries , pasta normal kids food but again very well prepared.  There is a piano player , jazz guy vocalist performing. Truly enjoyable. This is not a place for frugality , cheese , trout x2 , salmon , kids food plus 2 glasses of wine ...just over $180 before tip.   Summary , for me the place is superbly located , food and wine are excellent  , service could be a little tighter ( a little! ) and the pricing needs a little adjustment . ($16 for a bowl of butter pasta for a 10 year old ) . I will be back ....",

I said no & she said it's not a problem as they'll set us right away. Then she said to take a seat and a wait. As we waited, more groups came in and were immediately sat w/no reservations like us. After 10 minutes of waiting in a restaurant that had about 90% available seating, my senior parents felt it was time to leave and give another restaurant our business.  On our way out, the hostess noticed us and said she can seat us now. At that point it was too late as it seems all that mattered to her anyway instead of seating guests was to stock plates & things for her espresso machine. Very rude service. Never even got to try their food. What a shame.",

We went in for Sunday brunch, the place was almost empty, not a good first sign. We were seated at a table in the sun so we asked to move...that was our big mistake. We moved to a table on the upper patio and we were basically ignored from that point on. We had to flag down the waitress to get water and again to place our order. The drinks took a good 10-15 minutes to arrive, thats not an exaggeration. For a wine shop you would think they would know the difference between champagne and vouvray, but apparently not. So, after waiting they got the drinks incorrect. Had to flag down the waitress and correct the order, this took another 10 minutes. We were on the verge of leaving when a different person showed up at our table to be our waiter. He wasn't much better. The food was so-so, consistent with other reviews for this place. I'm not sure why they keep getting 4 star ratings. Must be the location. As a local who entertains visitors all the time, I was embarrassed by the service and food. Sad.

Jackson, Prince, Jamriquia (sp), and John Legend  2) Probably the best french Onion soup I have ever had. If you like gooey cheese version.. yUM  3) Noise level was perfect.. Nobody was scunched next to us and I can perfectly hear all round me.   4) My gf had the salmon and I had the braised short ribs.. Defintely a little too rich (short ribs) but still delicious and the salmon had a nice sauce and cooked well.   5) Friendly people, environement and a great staff. Thanks again for making my anniversary a memorable one!",

I had the duck lasagna which was not recognizable as either duck or lasagna; tasted more like some kind of tuna dish.  He had Forbidden rice chicken something which was shy on chicken by a lot.  We had Black Chicken zin by the glass for desert which I thought was not bad, we bought a bottle of it in their wine store.  If you consider this place a great alternative for outdoor dining when the weather is rainy or windy (they can pull the canopy and shutters for a wind- and rain-free experience) or you just don't have the time to get to Lake Las Vegas's Sunset and Vines, this might be a good compromise.  At 1:15pm for lunch on a Thursday, the crowd was small and not noisy.",

    "text": "Visited Marche Bacchus with my mother for a special lunch, and sadly was VERY disappointed.  The 2 stars is for the environment, which is very lovely, and the food which is solid.  The big issue with this restaurant is the service.  I had called the day before to make reservations, with a special request for a customized wine tasting.  When we arrived I reminded them that we wanted a customized flight.  There were no notes on our reservation, and apparently the guy that handles those requests was not there.  We were asked if we could wait 10-15 minutes, and he would arrive and speak with us about what we wanted. No problem!  But...alas, he never came to our table.  Meanwhile, after multiple conversations with a couple of the staff members there, this small request became a big deal.  Finally our waitress mentions that we could choose our own wines for a 2 oz flight from a limited list of wines.  WHAT?!?!  That's what we wanted.  What is wrong with this picture?  I said that was great, and we wanted the wine before or with lunch....not after.  Well, lunch was served, and no wine.  It took so darn long, that I had to get up in the middle of eating and find out what was going on.  It was very stressful.  We finally got the wine, but the whole experienced was soured by that point.  Just really ridiculous for a place whose business centers around wine.",

This restaurant has expanded their seating.  The first food I usually taste in a restaurant is the bread and butter (or olive oil). Most Las Vegas restaurants fall down on the bread. Here the bread and sweet butter was first rate which means it was baked in house instead of being bought somewhere else and heated in the oven. Next came the lobster salad croissant with French fries at $14. It was a real treat. Super delicious and the croissant was quite crisp even though it came with this salad. In short, everything was perfect. I will be back.   Perfection is a hard act to follow but I am optimistic about a return meal.",

    "text": "Let me first preface this review with the fact that I have been coming to this establishment for 6 years and when I have relatives in town, we have always made it a point to go in. I have always enjoyed the scenery and thought the concept was cool, the restaurant/wine cellar. Today was the last time I will be dining at Marche Bacchus! I have a two year old and DO understand not kid friendly dining establishments. For the better part of the past 10 years I have waited tables on the strip in an establishment that was not considered kid friendly. I NEVER treated any guest the way we were treated today. As a server, you can be miserable waiting on the \"kid\" table or suck it up and make the best of the next hour and a half. I think everyone we encountered wanted to make the experience miserable. Needless to say, the staff made it very apparent we were not welcome and we could go elsewhere. I am sure we were also treated in this manner because we were a party of 6, so it was probably an autograt on the tab.       The hostess was the rudest, most annoyed young lady I have ever seen at the front of a restaurant. This position is the first and last person you see upon entering and exiting the building. They need to be energetic and enthusiastic. This young lady was neither. She was SO irritated to count the number of guest, and ANGRY when I asked for a high chair- which she was far too busy to get anyways. She grabbed 1 kids menu and when I asked for another so rolled her eyes and said she only had one. So that is great, 1 piece of paper for a 6 year old and a 2 year old. Good thing I come prepared and have my own paper and crayons. We were taken to our table which had 5 chairs and no high chair. My two year old sat down on the chair- what was available. And the hostess promptly looked at me as if I did something wrong, and said \"so do you want the high chair or NOT?\" I said \"I guess not\" and grabbed a chair from the table behind us.        Then the server comes over to fill our water glasses and I ask to have a plastic cup, he said he had Togo bowls but not cups. We get our drink and food orders in. The food comes out and everything seemed fine. We eat, and order dessert. At this time, my husband, my daughter and myself need to leave as it was nap time. I really do understand not kid friendly, but this establishment took it to the next level of being unwelcome. I am a mother now and if families are not welcome than I will take my money elsewhere. Never again will we bring family there, dine there on date nights or pop in for a small bite and glass of wine- like we used to. I always considered the restaurant to be one of Las Vegas, best kept secrets for locals. It seems strange, that their demographic would probably be to older people whom have children and even grandchildren. One day I will be that grandparent or parent whom they might want to frequent their establishment. But they cannot seem to act cordial to parents of young children, they will not have my business as my kids grow older. This is a BIG city known for its dining and I am sure I will be able to find a replacement.",

If you are a wine lover, you are in luck as the front entrance is basically a wine shop, containing all the best wines!  I was in wine heaven from the first step walking into the front door. Pick your bottle and your waiter will bring it out to your table.  Then continuing outside on the terrace where seating was overlooking the lake was incredible.  They had outdoor fire places going and acoustic music as well. They also have floor to ceiling windows for colder weather, so you can still enjoy the lake view.  I keep going back and bringing all my friends, whenever anyone is looking for a special night, Marche Bacchus is first on the list to suggest.  Did I forget to mention the food is incredible and the service A+.  Do not miss this stop if you are here on vacation---it is well worth the drive out from the strip to have lunch or dinner here!  If I could give the restaurant any suggestion, it would be to rotate their acoustic performers more often and keep to straight acoustic not cheesy programmed drums for the one guitar player etc.  Keep it real  and classy to go with the classy restaurant!",

It was 105 degrees so we took a table inside amonst the racks of really great wines.  I did not have a chance to browse the shelves but the wines seemed to not be outragiously expensive.  Lunch was outstanding!  I ordered a the short-rib sandwich with a salad.  The flavor of the sandwich was outstanding and we ordered french fries for the table that were amazing.  This is a great little spot and I know that it is popular with locals and people that buy wines from the retail store.  Our Las Vegas trips are fairly regular but I if it were a little closer to the \"strip\" I would love to go back.

My party was initially impressed with the lovely (man-made) lake view and the talented jazz guitarist/vocalist.  Unfortunately, our initial impression was marred by several factors:  1) we had a long wait for our dinner (45 min) 2) my order was incorrect 3) our blonde server was not really attentive (she did not ask us how our food was....she didn't ask if we wanted coffee or tea with our dessert order!)  On the plus side, the view is lovely.  My meal was complimentary due to the kitchen's error.  The food and wine were wonderful.  I would come here again to see if the service would be better.  For a first-time visit, however, this was a little disappointing, especially since the prices are on the expensive side.  Aren't pricier restaurants supposed to ensure quality of food AND service?  Marche Bacchus has a lot of potential for consistent 5-star ratings....y'all have the food, wine, and view part down....now, work on your wait staff!",

    "text": "On every Las Vegan's \"Off-the-Strip-Dining\" list probably lies Marche Bacchus, a charming bistro and wine market overlooking a peaceful lake away from the main strip.  The diverse French cuisine will appeal to Francophiles, and the comprehensive wine selection will appeal will oenophiles.  The French have always done brunch well (partially due to their social belief that drinking after 12 pm is acceptable, even admirable).  Marche Bacchus is my favorite place to go in Vegas for a brunch that makes me forget I live in the Mojave dessert.  Also, the restaurant offers both their brunch and lunch menu at this time, which offer many more authentic choices than just their dinner menu.  If it's spring in Vegas, I order the Moules Frites, mussels in white wine butter sauce with crusty baguette, a light and delicious classic that Marche does well; don't forget the Mimosa.    If it's summer, I order the lobster avocado croissant, pair it with a Riesling from the market; the sweetness of the Riesling highlights the lobster and brings out the richness of the avocado.    If it's fall, I order the duck confit & fettucini pasta, it's a calorie splurge but completely worth it.    And if it's winter, I get the Les Oeufs En Meurette, three perfect poached eggs in hearty red wine sauce with ham and mushrooms; it's a dish that warms your stomach, and your heart; break some rules and order a glass of Cotes Du Rhone with it: red wine works for daytime when it's Vegas harsh dry winter.  Dessert is their weakness.  I haven't fallen in love with any Marche Bacchus sweets; although I daydream about imported truffles from La Maison Du Chocolat or Patrick Roger whenever I visit.",

Make a reservation and you'll usually be seated on the patio with a nice view of the adjacent lake.  The wine selection is extensive and a but unique.  You can self-shop for a bottle  from a  very nice cross section of better than average wines and take it in to dinner.

One beverage came and the other did not so we asked again.  Our meals were all right but I've had much better charcuterie.  The sorbet arrived melted; it was more like soup.  The waiter could have seen this and recommended something else. Lastly there were pigeons walking all around.

    "text": "Left Marche Bacchus today with something to be desired... and it wasn't dessert.   This is a pretty nice place if you want to have a relaxed off strip lunch/dinner and enjoy a view of a man made lake. I'm sure the optimal time to be here for dinner would be right before sunset. Would be a great place to bring friends or family that are aspiring sommelier or \"cork dorks\" as they sell tons of different wine in their lobby.   First and foremost the food was excellent and a positive experience. Started off with the charcuterie which included a table favorite of pork pate, cured meats, little pickles, olives, and dijon mustard. Entrees included were the crispy maple leaf duck breast, steak frites, and a Thursday special of a 14 oz Kansas Strip steak. Everything was presented beautifully and cooked well except towards the middle the Kansas strip was a bit tough to chew. Bordelaise sauce was delicious, duck was cooked medium-rare with enough rendering on the fat to make it easy to chew.   Why the 3 stars then?  Well... earlier I mentioned something was to be desired... and the service is just that. The service today was just painfully slow. My server exhibited professionalism, but jeez he was hardly attending our table. He definitely seemed more interested in taking care of the table in front of us with all females.. these are times I wish I had breast :(. Our charcuterie came out maybe 10 minutes after ordering, but I notice the table across from us received their fromage order within less than 5 minutes of ordering with two baskets of bread.  Never really came to our table to see if everything was okay. Made eye contact a few times, but he just passed by. Later on when it came time to pay the server was no where to be seen, so I went inside to pay at the register and even his co workers weren't sure where he was. Perhaps he just had a bad day, but bummer I had to get him on his bad day. Dinner for 3 came out to be $126 after tax, but I felt a bit bummed out tipping more than 15% for service that could have been better fulfilled at an Applebee's... sorry.   First experience at Marche Bacchus, may return, but definitely not in a rush to do so.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to come to Marche' for a long, long time. You won't ever run into this restaurant unless you go into the Desert Shores housing community so it's a hidden gem that some people may not even know is there. I did, because I tried unsuccessfully to buy a house here and got outbid at every corner.  Angela H. put on a Sunday brunch UYE and we had prime patio seating for it. If it's nice out - take advantage of it! It's a shaded patio over looking the lake and has vines and potted plants giving a feel of being in someones lovely yard. It was busy, but not crowded in feeling and was a pleasant vibe for all of us to converse.   I came late, but they were able to get my food out to me in a jiffy and our server was very pleasant. I had the buckwheat crepes with mushrooms and chicken. The sauce was pleasant and creamy and had to be sopped up with some bread, chicken was cooked right and I like the mushrooms were a mix of beech and oyster. The salad with it was a nice mix of greens with a hint of orange in the vinaigrette.   I don't know why I haven't gone here sooner, but probably because my ego is bruised that I don't get to walk her from my backyard to brunch at the lake. I most definitely will be back as it's prime outdoor dining weather and the food was solid. I will be back for their weekday lunch special pre fixe as that seems like a great deal!",

It was on that record breaking hot day that we sat on the patio over looking the lake. Even on this hot day the outdoor patio was very comfortable.   The service was very good! I had the heirloom tomato salad this was one of my training push weeks so, I go completely meatless (fish included and try to be strictly plant based) big mistake the salad was ok but not at all what I expected (the reason I don't give 5 stars).  My brother had the turkey sandwich with fries and OMG did it look good. A thick slice of fresh turkey breast with a red cabbage slaw he said it was great and offered me a bite. The fries looked perfect so, clearly the food is good!   The place is actually a wine store with a great selection of wines and the neat part is for $10 more than the retail price you can enjoy it at your table. There was a young couple who appeared to be celebrating and had a new bottle of champagne.   Well worth the trip I highly recommend it.",

Located away from the glamour and gaudy strip, this is a store that sells fine wines of many varieties but it is also a wonderful lakeside brunch place.  I was here last month on a mildly warm 80 degree Vegas spring day and there couldn't be a better place than on the patio covered under the shade of gently nodding trees and in the company of a touching zephyr breeze amind the cyan colored artificial lake.  The service is perfect.  You don't feel rushed, but at the same time, when you order, your food is there pretty quickly.  The menu is simple to read with typical french classics like French Onion soup, but the wines are superb as well.  The desserts, especially the bread pudding, are sinful and I really didn't want to leave.  This is a wonderful place to dine at if you are passing thru Vegas.  I was on my way to Flagstaff and was revitalized by this place.",

    "text": "This was my first dinning experience at this restaurant and I'm sorry to report that chances are slim to none that I will ever return.  The service was average at best, wait time was much slower than it should be.  The champagne arrived warm and it took over 20 minutes for it to get to an acceptable chill.  I had to ask the waiter to please bring more ice since when we complained that it was warm and they didn't respond.  We shared the foie gras and it was extremely small for $20 and the toast served with it was so heavily drenched in butter it overpowered the taste.  We had to ask for plain bread instead.  We then had the salmon entree and a side order of the mac n cheese.  Very nice flavor and we left feeling satisfied.  However, around 5 hours later, we both started experiencing stomach cramps and diarrhea.  This went on all night long.  I wasn't happy about spending $180 for dinner and getting sick, so the next morning I called to tell management our experience.  I wasn't sure what to, but I thought they should know.  She spoke to me very courteously, but basically said, ' they checked all their food for expiration, and no one else complained\".  This reaction annoyed me.  I feel at the very least an apology was in order and perhaps offer of something on our next visit, anything!  This is very poor customer service and I will not return there again.  There are too many places for fine dinning here, i don't have to patronize an establishment that is not concerned about my comfort or satisfaction.",

We had made reservations for 6 through Open Table, and when we arrived, they claimed they did not have the reservation.  This meant we would not be seated on the patio.  We waited for 30 minutes to see if they could accommodate us, the best they could do was to seat us inside.  The service was terrible. Everything from waiting way too long to take our order to not keeping water glasses full and even getting our entree order incorrect.  I'm not a difficult customer, but the service here has become insufficient.  I'm not sure what is happening at this place, but we have given them too many excuses... NOT going back.",

    "text": "In searching for eating establishments away from the strip I kept tripping over Marche Bacchus.  During our stay this time we made it a point to go check the place out.  We were a little taken aback when our GPS took us to a strip mall, a boring one at that.  But we decided to go in anyways.    You walk in through a wine shop.  We were immediately greeted warmly and the hostess knew EXACTLY where she was going to seat us and that the table needed to be attended to first.  i LOVE when the staff knows the condition of their restaurant at all times.  We walked through the wine shop while our table was prepared.  The wine shop needs it's own review of 5 stars.  They have some serious labels here, Caymus, Far Niente, Opus.. and on and on.. The prices are very decent AND you can choose your bottle of wine and have it opened at your dinner table for a $10 corkage fee.  : )  We were seated before we had time to even walk half of the wine shop.  They had a 100 person wedding reception that evening, but you would have never known.  We were treated as if we were the only patrons there.  We were there for dinner and since it was night time and the lake does not have lighting you knew you were by water, but we really had no view.  There was a two piece band playing jazz music that made the whole atmosphere perfect for a romantic dinner.  The menu is VERY nice.  It has a little of everything.  We chose to start with the Escargot in a lemon garlic butter sauce.  Very traditional and perfectly executed.  They served us fresh French bread that was delicious.  Hubby ordered the Filet Mignon with a peppercorn sauce and asked for pomme frite as his side dish.  I ordered the lobster ravioli in a lobster burre blanc sauce covered in asparagus and sweet corn.  Both dishes were amazing.  I rarely finish a plate of food, but I was not about to leave anything on my plate, it was so freaking good.  They also have fabulous wines by the glass I was very happy to find an 2007 Chateauneuf-du-Pape to enjoy.  OH YUM  This is a 5-star all the way through.  The staff awesome, the ambiance fab and the food is to die for..  Extra plus this place is only 5 minutes from our Vegas house and soon to be a usual spot for us.",

    "text": "Update - so my previous review created quite a stir among both MB fans and detractors, but most importantly, it allowed the owners a chance to show their reaction to an irrate customer. Much to my appreciative surprise, the handled it with perfection. First, they contacted me in a private FB message, apologized and offered to send my money back in a gift card. They also asked me to come meet them. The former I accepted, the latter I did not - not because i didnt want to meet them but because I wanted to try it again without any bias to \"make it right\" because of my previous review.  I waited several months, and returned in September with a business colleague after work one evening. I have to say both the food and the service were top rate. Duck was perfect, filet was amazing. Atmosphere exceptional. I was impressed. I left deciding to try again before writing an update, and next time meet the owners. But I havent had a chance to go back yet ... But I did recently finally meet one of the owners.  I got a call from a mutual friend to play a scramble charity golf tournament in October. Whether he did it on purpose to bring Jeff Wyatt and me together, I don't know. Whether Jeff recognized my name as the crazy Valentines Day Reviewer, I dont know either. We never mentioned it - But after an afternoon of terribly bad golf, a over abundance of imbibbing, and corporate laughing so hard my sides ached, I left with a very favorable impression of Jeff Wyatt. A great guy - not only good to his sometimes irritable customers but a gracious and affable person in his own right.  MB continues to be a curiosity to me in several ways. It has an atmosphere and ambiance that cannot be rivaled at any Las Vegas venue. It's food is intriging, if on rare occasion there is a miss there are also many times it is on the mark. Service is a bit of a dice roll, but at least I know it is NOT a top down issue. So I am back on the fan side, and definitely recommend including it in your local restaurant choices, if not make a special trip from the Strip gor the evening. I will be back - and next time, I will ask to see Jeff when I first come in",

I love the vibe of this place and the view of the lake here. Place, it has a nice little wine shop in front so you can pick out your wine there for your dinner. This is a great place for dinner during the spring and summer times. The vibe you get from this place is fantastic and the food is delicious. However, the service is rather mediocore and needs improvement. The waiters/waitresses here are not very attentive. Sometimes no one pays attention to you for 30-40 minutes and your food is no where in sight for an hour or so. They make mistakes with bills and orders too. I tend to forgive them as I love all other things about this place.",

The food is unique and always good.. BUT the wait (1) to give our order, (2) to get our food (over an hour after we were seated) (3) to get our bills and (4) to have our bills taken and processed was inexcusable. Our reservation was for noon -- we left, finally, close to 2:30.  Now the setting is beautiful and what's not to like about sitting on a patio on a lake on a gorgeous day? And if we'd had all the time in the world, I'd say, \"okay.\" But not everyone had 2-1/2  hours for lunch.  The problem seemed to be that the restaurant went from a few people to capacity in about 20 minutes. There were two large groups (ours and one other) seated at our end of the patio, which was 16 people at once. Plus the other regular tables with two and four people. Our waiter was overwhelmed.  I won't go into painful detail, but the service was terrible. Not the waiter's fault -- he was doing his best. Other friends told me, \"the kitchen is very small. You have to be patient.\" (REMEMBER THIS if you go.) After about 30 minutes we finally asked for and got bread.   Once we had finished eating and asked for the checks it was another 10-12 minutes until someone (actually two different men in succession) came and explained that since we had asked for separate checks, we would have to be patient while they sorted them out. The lady who made the reservation had said we would need separate checks. We told the waiter at the beginning we would want separate checks and asked if it was a problem. He assured us it was not. Well, apparently it was.  I certainly recommend Marche Bacchus for a lovely, laid-back lunch or dinner. Just be sure that you have the time for a leisurely meal.",

Most patio dining here is looking at a parking lot which boggles my mind. The last thing anyone wants when dining out is car fumes passing them by along with all the traffic noise.  So if you're looking for a peaceful place with beautiful scenery on your next dinner date...check this place out. And yes, the food and ambiance is too notch. I highly recommend the pan seared salmon or the free range chicken with a side of the truffle Mac and cheese. And the wine selection is fantastic too. Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have wanted to try this restaurant for a while now and since it was my wife's birthday we decided to try it for lunch after we had a relaxing massage next door at The Spa at Lakeside. When you first walk in the restaurant you walk through a wine store and the restaurant is beyond that. We sat on the patio, it was a hot day in Vegas but they do have misters on the patio which help to keep the temp down. If you don't want to sit on the patio they do have an inside area that is air conditioned.  The view was beautiful and the service was outstanding.   What I really liked about this restaurant is you can actually hear each other talk versus most other restaurants today where it is so noisy you cannot hear what anyone has to say! The food was exceptional. I had the Salmon Sandwich and my wife decided to make two appetizers her meal, she had the crab cake which was good however we always compare crab cakes to the ones we have had at Santa Anita's front runner room. At the Front runner they use very little breading and make a hard shell and the crab meat is inside the shell. By far the best we have ever had.  This one was good as well and while not as good as the Front runner it is one of the better ones we have had in Vegas.  She also had the Truffled Goad Cheese Napoleon which she loved and would definitely get again.  The portions were decent size and my sandwich also came with a choice of salad or fries. I went for the salad with a poppy seed vinaigrette dressing.  We did not have any desert but they sounded great! The prices were not all that bad and are actually in line with a Boca park chain restaurant with the initials CF. In an area of town that is a food desert (unless you count the national chains) this certainly is a hidden gem.  I will definitely be back and bring lots of friends and family to this restaurant.",

Had to ask for bread, and an appetizer. Our drinks and cheese plate arrived 15 min later. The waiter seemed not interested or engaged, he was doing us a favor.  The food came out over salty, cold, and out right inedible. We asked to speak to the manager. He arrived cheerful and quickly became aggressive raising his voice. He informed us he would take care of problem but never returned.  We asked for the check(which should have been comped) nope. Paid and will NEVER return. As we were leaving our waiter was laughing at us.  Management, chefs and waitstaff all need a kick in the ass. The place has so much potential, service and food was F quality.

It took over 15 minutes for our waitress, Mandy to come over and take our order because she decided to take other table's order first that came after us. Took another 10 minutes for her to bring water and iced tea. At this point, the other table's (that came after us) food was already on their table. We waited another 10 minutes and asked the waitress where our food is. She said \"in a couple of minutes.\" but  I think she forgot to put our order in. We waited another 10 minutes and saw the other table had their desserts on the table. So we left. 45 minutes wasted.  I understand sometimes kitchen could get backed up and the service would become slow, but at least they could have put a bread on our table. No apologies either!! We were starving and upset!! So disappointing!!",

You can always go to the strip and get something that is pretty good, but incredibly overpriced and you have to deal with some interesting people on your way to the restaurant.  If you are like me and live in Las Vegas and don't want to deal with the strip every time you would like a nice meal this is a restaurant you should try.  Their wine selection is great and their food even better.  My husband and I ordered their beef tenderloin, duck, and a side of their mash potatoes.  All were delicious, and the been tenderloin truly melted in your mouth.  (All restaurants always claim their tenderloin will melt in your mouth, but few actually succeed.)  The outside patio, on the lake, was charming and the staff was excellent.  There was live music and I loved how the restaurant's noise level was very low compared to some of the other fine dinning establishments we have visited.  Check this place out, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Visit: Sunday Brunch, Oct. 25, 2015.  It was a beautiful day, the restaurant was busy, my friend and I were seated outside at a wonderful table for two overlooking the lake.  The waiter was prompt, attentive, and friendly.  We ordered two Lobster Croissants, one with a Caesar Salad, the other with French Fries.  After our meal, for dessert we ordered two Cappuccinos, a Tiramisu, and a Fruit Tart.  I can't find my receipt, but I paid with cash and recall leaving around $75, which included a 20% tip.  Lobster Croissant:  As someone that first eats with my eyes, I must admit that the presentation leaves much to be desired. The sandwiches looked haphazardly thrown together -- and even lacked consistency between how the two sandwiches were prepared...one sandwich having a balance of ingredients, the other having very little avocado and a croissant that could have been better toasted.   So, there sat a plate of beautiful ingredients...Lobster with fresh avocado, inside of a buttery croissant!  And yet, sadly, the star of the show (the Lobster) had to compete with the red onions that gave it a bite that I could have just done without. And, the lobster salad itself was \"very\" sweet -- I couldn't quite put my finger on it...I couldn't tell if the dressing had sugar added or if the lobster was imitation. *you be the judge*  Tiramisu:  It was uneventful. *not good, not bad* I liked that I could taste the tartness of the cheese, but I would have enjoyed it more if I could taste a stronger espresso flavor -- it just didn't come through.  Fruit Tart:  My first impression was...\"Jeez, that's tiny - I should've ordered two.\"  Despite the small portion, the deconstructed components of this dessert are lovely in of themselves!  The crust of the tart is flaky, the custard creamy and perfectly sweet, the berries are fresh, and the sorbet was flavorful.   However, as a cohesive dish?!  Ehhh! :-/ The thing is, there was too much crust and fruit to custard ratio.     Feedback:  If the tart is made to order, it would be nice to have the crust/shell filled completely with custard.   And the sorbet would be best served on the side or better yet replaced all together with something like whipped cream, vanilla ice cream or sorbet, or vanilla cream fraiche.  ----------   Side Note:  I've been a customer of Marche' Bacchus for many-many years. There was a time when I would eat here several times a week because my office was just around the corner, the food was Fabulous!!! I adored this place in every way! However, although the staff is wonderful and the atmosphere has pretty much remained the same throughout the years, the food has gone from Fabulous to simply good/okay. -- I don't know who or what changed in the kitchen, but it is blatantly obvious that things are very different...and it saddens me to say, not for the better.    For now, I will continue to patron Marche' Bacchus on occasion for all the reasons that I still adore it -- and hold the hope that things will get better.",

We arrived right before noon and it was still a little quiet, especially for great day like Father's Day.  Dining for us was outside and even though we were in the middle of 100+ degree Vegas weather, we were kept cool with the shade and cool mist. The service was great, staff was attentive, and the ambiance was relaxing.  My GF had a view of the lake, which was the relaxing part. My opinion, I had the best view.   As for their food, lets start with their menu.  Their menu for brunch was simple and prices are what to expect from a French Restaurant.  Actually, their prices for what you get are pretty good. I got their Steak & Eggs, which is also served with some home fries. The steak was the highlight. I would guess about 6 oz of well seasoned, well prepared, and thinly sliced steak.  Normally steak & eggs come a little dry. Not here, their steak was juicy and delicious.  For my pre-steak meal, I got a cup of their French Onion Soup.  This was delicious as well. It wasn't overly salty and had enough of an onion kick to it.   This was my first time here and I was impressed with their service and quality of food.  I'm still curious what dinner is like here so I'm going to have to come back. I'm also appreciative to my GF for surprising me with memorable Father's Day brunch.  1OAK!

I've been here three times now and have had pretty decent experiences each time. Truffled goat cheese Napolean, um yes please!! The philo puffed pastry is so flaky and buttery, it melts in your mouth.. the goat cheese, mmmmmm! Highly recommended! Service here is hit or miss.. The lobster salad croissant is ok...there are way better things to eat here, take it from me..,I learned the hard way.!  The turkey sandwich on the lunch menu, yum!  The burger is one of the best I've ever had in my life! No lie! The Brie is the icing on the cake, so to speak.. I love my red meat, and they cook it to perfection! I can't even explain how melty in my mouth their tenderloin and mashed potatoes is..  I swear, you can't go wrong with whatever you order!  No cocktails here, it's pretty much a wine specialty place.. however, when I mentioned I'm from Michigan where there are a ton of vineyards up north, the waiter suggested they may be able to order me a special wine! Much to my dismay, the request was declined.  The stocked Riesling is on the sweet side, which is how I like it. If you order a bottle with dinner, they charge a $10 service fee. I don't exactly care for this, but it is what it is. I just would like to be told ahead of time. I've got $10, just let me know!  The view is so pretty. The facility sits on a tiny lake..it's the desert, not the Pacific coast..we take what we can get! Once here for lunch, a friendly duck even came inside to greet patrons! I do enjoy watching the black swans on the lake...but you can't see them at all at night. It can be kind of cold in the winter (even with the provided heaters).. perhaps another glass of wine will warm you up :-) One of my favorite local places, I'll be back!",

Ian was awesome there was about 7 of us, our waters coffee's and mimosas were always kept full. Ian was very polite and had a great attitude and was very knowledgeable about the menu.

The location on the lake is beautiful, but they NEED to clean the patio area, especially the roof that is full of dirt and leaves that the wind blows into your food and drinks. The thin, blonde hostess had an attitude and sat us at a terrible table on the patio with no view, directly in front of a fireplace that was off despite it being in the 60s and raining. The food was unremarkable. It's not bad, but it definitely wasn't worth the $60 we spent on lunch for two of us. Uninspired and tepid would be the most accurate description I could give it.   The young blonde server (who's makeup was ON POINT) was the highlight of our experience. The service was slow, but I highly doubt this was her fault. This place clearly has something special going for it given its tenure in the city.... but given the fact we were the only patrons in there under 65, I'd suggest a refresh to keep up with the times and attract new customers.",

It's almost like they got lazy about the little things that mattered. For the chicken and waffles for example, it used to come with butter that had been marinated in orange peels that really added to the taste of the waffles. They no longer do that. Today I called to order a take out order and I was going to order one of their sandwiches only to be told that was no longer on the menu. They replaced their roasted chicken breast sandwich for fried chicken. You'd think they'd take the time to update their online menu if they were going to go and change it. It's a shame this place has gone down hill because at some point we used to look forward to our Sunday brunch here every Sunday.",

Made an open table reservation for a 50th birthday, \"please give us a special table, it's a 50th birthday celebration.\"  Waiter (Marty - also the \"manager\" - huh?) acknowledged the occasion while dropping bread and water, but became freakishly argumentative over a simple request/question about the wine before the food order was even taken. We had been there literally 10 minutes.  Really?  The guy then grabbed the menus off the table after saying that I \"clearly wasn't listening\" to his explanation, which I've heard before here, that all their wines are 'fresh'  - no matter how long the bottles have been open - due to their cutting-edge corking system, and stalked away.  We got up and asked for the manager, only to learn that Marty IS the manager!   - - What?!!    Left a detailed message and number for the owner - no response.  However, Marty later called and apologized.  \"I'm not sure why I was so rude.\"  Yeah, Marty, I'm not sure either, but thanks for the memory. If this guy is a manager he needs to be terminated.  The only reason I ever came here was for the lake view, ducks, and great windows -  never the food or service, which has always been \"ehhh.\"   But talking like this to customers over a polite request over wine? Totally outrageous.",

Most come with a very hefty price tag, but Marche Bacchus is the exception. You can make it hefty, but why?  The menu offers very recognizable French dishes, and delicious interpretations. Service is phenomenal.  We were seated lakeside next to a very cozy fireplace. Cheese plate (often varies based on availability),  French onion soup mixed with caramelized onions, Gruyere and croutons, and the Scottish Salmon. Everything was executed to perfection, along with the wine parings.   Try and leave room for desert. I didn't.  Bon appetit!",

They will tell you \"no problem\" when you call and ask for a table outside by the lake. When you show up 15 minutes before your reservation, they will tell you sorry, the outside is full... you'll have to wait at least 30 minutes. I was appalled. I am not sure how many people come here for the food. Most people who come here look for that experience having a relaxed meal by the lake. This was unacceptable. I was speechless when I overheard other groups complaining about the same problem. If you don't have a spot, then just be honest. This Truely felt like a bait-and-switch. Not a fan.   The food was good. The bread you get at the start is great. Fluffy on the inside, crunchy on the outside. Yellowtail Crudo was a great way to go after the bread. I got lamb chop. It was good but nothing special. I got medium rare. The meat itself is a bit mushy. Nothing really was sepcial about the food, but maybe I just wasn't in the mood.   The service was good for a busy mother's day. We waited for 50 minutes for our main courses but I expected it.   The truth is, no matter how great everything was, I have no tolerance for dishonesty. This will be the last time for me.",

    "text": "I wish I had something newly discovered to share with you with this local gem...but Marche Bacchus has been a local's favorite for French and Mediterranean cuisine for many many years.  When you walk in, you will see cases and cases of wine presented orderly on shelves that beg you to wander...beautifully organized, and generally rated to help guide your decision. If you find something pleasing to have with your dinner, they will open it for you without a corkage fee...or bag it for you on the way out if you wish. I cannot claim to be a wine expert, but I do regularly enjoy wine with my meal, and the selection at Marche Bacchus is quite exquisite. There are a few seats inside but, most patrons opt to watch the swans and ducks go by on Lake Jacqueline as they sit on the patio. Outside, there are multiple tiers, with ample fire places or heaters if the weather is cold. Not all the tables have a fireplace though, so make a reservations or ask nicely. When the weather is beautiful, some of the seats open directly to the lake for added ambiance.  I've been dining here for over 3 years now. Marche Bacchus participates in Restaurant Week, so be sure to check it out. Our most recent visit took place as a celebration for our family. The evening was ideal...but if you have teenagers, especially girls, you know how long it can take them to get out of the house...so we were late to our reservation. Fortunately, they called to confirm as we were on our way...I love that they checked before making any assumption. They were kind and patient with our orders and service...by the end of our main course, it was getting close to their closing time, but the service was great, and we didn't feel rushed at all.  We ordered -Heirloom Tomato Panzanella Salad -Seared Scallops  -Halibut special of the day -Bistro Chicken -Roasted Scottish Salmon  They will bring a basket of warm bread with some amazing butter...whipped French butter that is! All of our orders came out together and were cooked perfectly. They were delicious! They have a vegan menu if you prefer...as well as Live Music some evenings.      The competition got hotter when Americana opened a couple doors down, but they are both great choices for a night out IMHO.  -2018 review #7-",

I also recommend the limoncello for dessert.    The atmosphere- a violinist played popular songs that are trending now which was a huge plus to me.   The view- was of the lake and added a touch of serenity and calmness.   Recommendation- that perhaps some misters are installed for outside seating during the hot summer  months.   Overall good time there -would definitely go back when the weather is much cooler.",

    "text": "Last visited before moving to Las Vegas, a lunch from David Middleton alongside Lake Jacqueline limited but performing well enough that five years between Meals was undoubtedly too long, it was as a party of two that dinner was enjoyed at Marche' Bacchus last Friday, Chef Amanda Hamilton now top toque and showing good skills across five courses.  Still tucked away north of Summerlin Parkway, the seclusion and scenery \"un-Vegas\" in all the right ways, those returning to Marche' Bacchus will likely notice a difference in the Restaurant's facade thanks to an incident involving a runaway truck last February, owners Rhonda and Jeff Wyatt using the \"opportunity\" to expand the Restaurant's Bar program which now adds top-shelf Liquor and Cocktails to the well-regarded Wine shop.  Popular amongst oenophiles and well-heeled locals, the serenity of Ducks paddling by on the water enhanced by live music from a lone man and his guitar, it was after brief perusal of the menu that a shared tasting was requested, service from a professional young man outperforming many Strip Restaurants even as an aged quartet loudly proclaiming their love for \"Foy Grasss\" occupied much of his time throughout the evening.  Seated in an elevated corner with some privacy, October's cooler temperatures perfect for dinner outdoors, it was with greetings from General Manager Angelo Reyes that Champagne started the evening, a warm basket of Bread buying time until the arrival of lightly charred Octopus that was a bit over-tenderized but otherwise enjoyable amongst Chickpeas, Tomatoes, Peppers and Olives.  Next offered a glass of Sauternes, the label not disclosed but sweetness and viscosity indicating it to be fairly young, it was in a classic pairing that Chef Hamilton presented seared Foie Gras atop Toast, a price comparable to the major Casinos justified by both portion and its presentation with Huckleberries and cracked Nuts.  Transitioning to White, a crisp Burgundy nicely matched to housemade Pasta that unfortunately sees Lobster get a little lost amidst fragrant Mushrooms and Citrus, it was by request that Duck was served next, the pan-seared skin and rosy flesh thankfully allowed to express their natural flavors which went well bite-for-bite with a complex Farro Salad and sips from Cotes du Rhone.  Opting for Cocktails over Port to finish, a mixologist behind the illuminated Abalone Shell Bar producing one fresh Martini and a truly indulgent Brandy Alexander, suffice it to say that saving room for Dessert at Marche' Bacchus is highly recommended as both the new Limoncello Souffle and Cheesecake are light and delicious, though not quite as noteworthy as Toffee-soaked Bread Pudding studded with Raisins.  FOUR STARS:  Matching scenery and service with a menu offering something for everyone Marche' Bacchus remains a worthy off-Strip destination nearly two decades since opening, and although not quite as refined as Bardot or classic as Andres the Wyatt's have something no other Restaurant in town can match in terms of their Wine prices while the new Bar and Happy Hour menu offer even more reasons to visit.",

That's all I can say. I got the rack of lamb and it was cooked to perfection. It was tender and cut like butter. And for dessert, I got the tiramisu which wasn't overly sweet like a lot of places. It was really good. Overall the ambiance and the location I would highly recommend this place for a date. It's right by the lake and the prices were pretty reasonable too. Over all I'd come back again and probably again.",

We were there for a private wine tasting and had some excellent wines and food of a diverse, however pricey menu. It was getting late, so we decided to order a couple of appetizers, eggplant, and the escargot, both very well prepared. The True highlight of this establishment is that's on the water in Desert Shores. You couldn't have a better backdrop. I understand brunch is wonderful. We will certainly come back for the experience",

The only reason I did not give this place 5 stars: I made my reservation a week and a half in advance, so when we were placed at a table that was not water side - I was a little disappointed. If you are booking a table for the patio, be sure to mention you would like water side seating. They also charge you a $10 corkage fee for their own wine which seems a little ridiculous. Also, the outdoor misters are a little much and I ended up getting semi-damp from them.   Apart from these tiny complaints, everything else was great and I will be back for sure. Very romantic setting.",

We talked to the host about the seating issue and they were kind enough to seat us at the top bar like seats! It was dark so they brought candles which made it really romantic! We started off with a caesars salad, then they accidentally made an extra one so they gave us one on the house. I ordered the king salmon which was full of flavor and really good! My hubby got the lobster pasta which was also really delicious !   Overall the service was good, food was great! I don't like wine, but their wine selection is huge!!!!",

    "text": "If/When I make it back to the magical Summerlin suburb, we will definitely be back to this little gem!  First of all, if you can find it through the maze of neighborhoods and suburb distractions, the Marche Bacchus is nestled in some corporate retail plaza and boasts the most amazing patio....EVER!  This patio is completely all weather....and on this particular night, it was a little chilly, but you never would have known it.  We were seated by the fire, and almost roasting in our seats. But they were happy to turn it down for us when we asked.  Which brings me to the service:                                                            AWESOME!  Joe was super nice and to the Beau's surprise, a beer connoisseur.  I swear, I saw his face light up when the Beau asked him what beers they had available.  Joe recommended an amazing beer that he just loved, and now we have to find here in MPLS.  But otherwise, he was excellent, attentive and talkative.  The only downside, I would say, would be that when I ordered a couple of reserve wines, he didn't ask me what size.  I thought one was the glass, and the other was the bottle, so I was thinking that what I ordered was the glass size.  What I got was the most expensive glass of wine....ever.  That kind of stunk, but they were super good wines.  The Beau ordered Steak Frites and I had the Warm Spinach Salad appetizer with the Sea Scallop appetizer for dinner.  I have no idea how to make Chorizo vinaigrette, but I was blown away by this salad.  And the scallops were amazing.  The beau loved his dinner too and  I was lucky he was willing to share.  Their fries were delicious and the steak was perfectly done.    Their wine store is awesome, although we didn't really look at much.  I hear you can purchase your wine and drink it with dinner - which is completely awesome.  And according to Joe, you can catch the owner on an episode of Pawn Stars!  He was the expert brought in to identify an original bottle of Dom Champagne.    This is definitely a place I would recommend to anyone who wants something completely off the strip, quiet, casual, but also sophisticated and intimate.  The Beau and I had an amazing time and agreed, this was the highlight of our trip.  Great atmosphere combined with great food and EXCELLENT service, this was definitely our favorite.  Thanks to all the local Las Vegas Yelpers that clued us in.  Oh....and it is True about the bread pudding. It is a MUST when you go.",

We arrived and started exploring the wine shop. To our utter delight, we found one of our favorite Sparkling Whites (Saint-Hilaire) and ordered a bottle to have with our dessert course. Our table was perfect - outside right on the edge of the lake! Our server, Nicole, was wonderfully attentive and helpful. We started with the Escargot - delicious and garlicky! The bread was warm, crusty and served with real whipped butter. We decided to split the Summer Salad with rhubarb dressing - I loved it. Hubby thought the dressing was too sweet. I ordered the Veal Braciole and Hubby got the Red Wine Braised Beef - both delicious! I ordered a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Hubby got a Barolo - NICE!! We had a hard time deciding on entrees because there were so many things we wanted to try. For dessert, I had the Fromage (5 different selections with caramelized onions and peppers, grapes and candied walnuts - YUM!) and Hubby got the Warm Chocolate Lava Cake with Chocolate Gelato instead of Vanilla Ice Cream. The cake was not as warm as he expected but was delicious none-the-less. We loved the entire experience and will be back very soon!!",

Very comfortable, even in the desert heat.  Twinkly lights and a garden trellises woven throughout the patio make for a romantic, lush setting.    Menu is fairly common French fare, scallops and risotto in lobster sauce was creamy and delicious.  Bonus: real French waiter!   Beware the wine-by-the-glass conversion to bottle price which somehow didn't add up right.  You're better off buying out of the wine shop.  Our waiter comped us dessert for our long wait for dinner....Some chocolate decadence and their signature bread pudding... both delicious.    $200 for a bottle of wine and dinner for 2.  2.5 hours of blissful ambiance that felt like we were 1000 miles from Las Vegas.",

Maybe this place is better for sipping wine and eating salads? Meh, I've experienced better is exactly how I rate this establishment.   I've recently spent a lot of time in France and have some problems identifying any similarities with the restaurant and quality French cuisine. It's almost criminal how much this place costs for subpar food.   I felt the mussels I ordered were dry and slightly over cooked. The sauce was bland and only in the bottom of the tiniest bowl ever to fit the portion. You want good mussels stateside? Try the ones in a champs vegetable cream sauce @ Rue de Jean, in Charleston, S.C.  I thought the escargot which I was dying to eat again, was the worst offender here! Completely under seasoned. It was so unlike what I ate in France. Consumed in too much parsley and a bland clumpy butter sauce that got cold and re solidified. Yuck. These two dishes are simple, yet elegant in flavor. What happened?   The main courses were average at best but not fabulous. Especially for the price.  The service was a little slow but friendly.   On a brighter note!  I did think the best part of the evening was rummaging through the wine selections in the store front of the restaurant. I recommend arriving early to your reservation to have time to pick out a fantastic wine to accompany your meal. A nice le vin rouge can really make it fabulous. If you can't finish it just get it corked to take home.",

He forgot to give us things we asked for. We ordered 3 course, when the food came, it was very mediocre.  Country pate that was old, tart that was falling apart, and my scallops did not have a starch, and done in 2 bites.  Now i am willing to pay money for good food, but this was ridiculous. We will never go back. Save your money, no view of a man made lake is that worth it.",

Both times we ordered the charcuterie plate which is incredible.  Great selection of meat and awesome cheese.  The dinner prices are a bit high but quality good tasting food.  Only major complaint is that they do not have a \"house wine\".  Be careful if you ask for it or ask for the to bring you something like a house wine.  Your gonna pay for it!!!  The restaurant sits on a man made lake.  We saw swans floating by both times.  There are small turtles that sit on the rocks right outside of where you sit.  I would like it if they could clean the spiderwebs that are all over the glass window enclosure.  We noticed it on both visits.  Oh, they have a mist system so when you sit outside on a warm Las Vegas evening it is quite comfortable.  Overall I would recommend this restaurant.",

That certainly beats paying double or triple which is what most restaurants do.the View is awesome especially close to sunset. I certainly have my favorites on the menu as i have dined here dozens of times but always seem to order the escargot and mussels. the cheese plate is awesome as well. I usually always try something different for the main course and sometimes just keeping ordering more mussels as the main as they are that good.

The view is scenic and you almost think your out of the country.  On Father's Day I tried your escargot and I was in WOW ! I grew up eating escargot from my Sicilian immigrant parents that made their own from gathering the snails from our garden after a good raining day and feeding them cream of wheat and water for 30 days to clean them out from the inside out and plump them up before cooking them many different ways. But, I must say their recipe is divine!  Save the bread for dipping in the sauce of the escargot.",

Although the service in this place was incredible. They were very professional, especially to my boyfriend and I, who celebrated our one year anniversary here. Everything about this restaurant was beautiful. We came around dinner time and my boyfriend loved his meal. I believe this restaurant does have a different menu, depending on the time of day. I ordered the scallops and they were absolutely wonderful. The scenery in this area was beautiful as well. I recommend going when the sun is almost setting or a little bit before so you have time to enjoy the outdoors. I also posted this place on my social media, which encouraged my friends to try it and they all loved it! I would definitely recommend this place because it's something different than the strip and the food is great!",

They have a wine tasting on Saturdays around noon, and before you enter there is a store. You can be seated inside slightly behind the 'store' or outside to enjoy the view. It's quite larger than I expected. Ideal for family/friends/celebration events.   They have a wonderful menu and good deserts. They have fresh baked bread with butter that I really enjoyed while I waited for my food. I did feel they were slow. Soup and salad should not take too long to be brought out. I ordered the honey glazed duck, which was so good with Riesling.   The tiramisu was so yummy too I should have ordered tea but with this heat it wasn't on my mind.  Overall experience for the first time I would come again, maybe after it cools down to enjoy outside again. I didn't really care much for the decor on the outside patio, it ain't no vitnergrill that's for sure.",

To improve the winter dining comfort on the patio, several fireplaces have been added to augment the vertical floor heaters. Our server Matt was friendly and provided excellent service.  The Happy Hour menu consists of a small number of appetizer size plates all at the same price. The wine selection was varied and all are half price by the glass.  On this evening we chose two items from the Happy Hour menu, the Escargot and Beef Ravioli. Also ordered was the Braised Beef entree from the dinner menu.  The Escargot were plump and served piping hot in an excellent butter, garlic, herb sauce. Don't forget to use the crusty bread to soak up the extra sauce.  The Beef Ravioli contained extremely tender meat. The ravioli's were perfectly cooked and swimming in a tasty sauce along with caramelized onions.  The Red Wine Braised Beef is served with White Truffle Grits and Roasted Cipollini Onions. Mashed potatoes were requested in place of the grits. The beef was cooked for four hours and was fork tender. The rich wine sauce was perfect with the creamy mashed potatoes.  The desert menu was irresistible. Both the Creme Brulee and Tiramisu were superb.  We have now added Marche Bacchus to our year round dining list.",

Marche Bacchus cavernous space includes a retail wine store, a couple of interior rooms, and an enclosed patio overlooking a small lake, The set turkey dinner was $45.00 for salad, turkey, sides, and dessert.  This wouldn't be a bad deal if anything tasted good.  Nothing did.  According to my companions, the salads were tasteless, the turkey dry, and the desserts in eatable.  I ordered off the a la carte menu with a bit more fortune.  While my goat cheese tarte was cloyingly sweet with a honey dripping, my braised beef tenderloin bits were rather tasty.  The pecan pie was a tasteless tarte, rather than any piece of pie.  Marche Bacchus serves only wine and beer, and must be the only restaurant in Las Vegas that doesn't serve liquor.  There wine list is decent, but I so wanted a cocktail.   Service was quite good, and I felt bad knowing he realized we weren't enjoying our meal.  The 30 minute drive from the Four Seasons was such a wasted trip.  Marche Bacchus did not provide a memorable Thanksgiving.   .",

At first I thought I walked into the wrong establishment, but was quickly greeted by the hostess who got me up to speed with my reservation.  I was meeting some friends for brunch and this was a nice setting for our first book club meeting.  I love the ambiance.  It felt like I wasn't even in Vegas.  The restaurant is situated right on a lake(man made I'm sure) but it is an exquisite view!    To my disappointment, the food I selected today wasn't that great.  I ordered the Crab Benedict.  Honestly, I've had better.  It was just simply bland, no flavors to spruce up the dish.  Mediocre to say the least.  My friend also ordered the escargot...sadly that didn't hit the spot either.    Overall, this place is fantastic if you're looking for ambiance and bottomless mimosas.  Other than that, thought the food was ok.  That's too bad.  This place had potential to be something really special.  Oh well...on to the next brunch spot.",

We opted for regular dining. When we arrived workers were sawing in a big dusty mess outside the front entrance. The hostess was totally confused about our reservation and where to seat us. There was black plastic hanging all over and boxes of construction junk piled to the ceiling in the entrance. They tried to seat us outside and it's still 103. They had misters and fans. No way. I was feeling very uncomfortable about having my family to this disaster. We told the waitress we were uncomfortable and they should have closed for remodeling. She agreed. We ordered a drink which took forever. The portable bar was in a little hole behind black plastic. The windows are filthy and the plastic view for the lake is all broken out. The floor is old nasty carpet in the dining area, nasty dirty tile in the wine store area. The whole place is disgusting. There was drilling, hammering and sawing going on. Dust everywhere. I think the waitress told the manager we weren't happy, he tried to move us outside. He was very nice. But, there is no excuse to try to pull this mess on guests. At this point we decided we were not staying and putting up with this for the prices they charge, especially. I had ordered one cocktail, my husband a Diet Coke that tasted like some kind of stored rainwater. After all this they actually charged us for the 2 drinks and no apology for the birthday dinner fiasco. I've never been so embarrassed. I wish they had mentioned all this on the phone. I have no idea how this  place is still in business. I hope the food is good. I'll never find out.",

I love being able to carry on a conversation and not have to us a phone light to see the menu.   The server was very good.  She was polite and made sure to keep our glasses ready with each bottle. I had the steak and frites.  I ordered MR but it was just a bit passed.  The dish overall was very good.  Everyone else enjoyed their food as well.",

    "text": "Place has gone downhill. The old chef left and the new chef is terrible. The service is absolutely horrible. We ordered the bucchus platter and the waitress said you want the buck-kus platter? You work here and you can't even pronounce the name of the place? It's \"bu-koo\"... inexperienced staff and the food was just awful. The pork belly was just drenched in some red wine reduction, it looked like a mass suicide with blood all over it. Not an appealing dish, deft not French cuisine. The cheese plate we asked for prosciutto and she said they stopped carrying it. You want to charge $26 for a meat and cheese plate then you should probably provide some prosciutto. Everything on the plate looked like dog food. We have had enough with this place. I can see why the reviews are horrible.  Updated review: Came here last night with my GF. First off why are they remolding while the restaurant is open? That is super unprofessional. People come here for a romantic evening and the first thing they see when they come in is 10 construction workers and 15 screw guns on the floor, do it while the restaurant is closed or just close for renovations for 2 weeks. The horrible part was the food was absolutely amazing, I had the new Pork Chop dish. Unfortunately I got food poisoning and I was in the bathroom an hr after we left and still am for the next 10 hrs. Thank you very much, I will probably not be coming back but  I absolutely love this place. Me and my GF go here and we love to drink wine. It's so cool when you walk in you walk around and pick your bottle and they bring it to your table. We had a cheese plate that was wonderful and then we had some beef this that fell apart in my mouth that's how tender is was. Deft a really good place to go on a date.",

    "text": "I ended up coming to Marche Bacchus on Father's day for dinner with my boyfriend's parents.  Marche Bacchus is located at the lakes in Summerlin. The restaurant is located in a plaza with spacious parking. We ended up going inside and was greeted by the hostess, whom was really friendly!  Our seating was table seating outside of the restaurant. The ambiance of this restaurant is really relaxing, sitting outside. It was nice to overlook the lake and ducks.  We had received a bottle of red wine and placed appetizers. We ended up ordering [1] French Onion Soup, [1] Pork Belly, and [1] Caesar Salad. All of the appetizers came out rapidly.   The French Onion Soup was okay. The cheese was a little overpowering in the soup. The Pork Belly which was crusted with a red wine. It was quite good. The Pork Belly was hard on the outside and soft in the inside. I would order the appetizer again.  For our entree we had ordered the following  [1] Filet Mignon [medium]  [1] Steak Frites [medium -- well-done] [1] Salmon [1] Mac n Cheese [1] Frisee Salad  I was extremely disappointed in the entrees. It took about 45 minutes for the entrees to arrive at the table. The food quality was relatively poor.  My Steak Frites that I had asked for medium/well-done was very under-cooked. It was red through-out the entire steak. I couldn't eat it. I never ask for cook to be re-heated, so I ended up just boxing it up to bring back home. My boyfriend's father's salmon was too fishy to eat.  My boyfriend thought the Mac n cheese was dry, but the Frisee salad was good. The Filet Mignon was cooked well and was flavorful. My daughter enjoyed the Filet Mignon.  I wouldn't recommend coming to this restaurant though. There are plenty of other restaurants that offer better quality food at a much cheaper price. The only recommendation that I would make is if you do come here, if you can get table seating outside, you can really enjoy the lake view. It is quite beautiful!",

They have a fireplace outside which wasn't lit when we were there but I'm sure it's nice on cold evenings. Beware of the mosquitoes though, wear your big spray! They came out after sunset and we were killing them left and right.   We arrived early and decided to get a drink at the bar. They obviously have an awesome wine list as they sell bottles of wine also.   The food was delicious. I would really like to try other items on the list. The service was also immaculate. We were with a large group and were able to get some small bites prior to dinner. I loved them all, so tasty. For desert I got the s'mores mousse and my husband got the bread pudding. As much as I thought mine was delicious, I about died and went to heaven when I tried the bread pudding. I ate all mine plus almost half of that!   Excellent dining experience, highly recommend!",

    "text": "Celebrated my birthday here with my parents.  I can see why there seems to be quite a mixed bag of reviews.  Here's my breakdown:  The service - Although it was slow, the server was great.  He was personable and knowledgeable and funny.  It just took too long between his check-ins with us.  The food - EXCELLENT!  Everything we got was delicious.  The only items I wasn't happy with were the desserts (one of which was a birthday gift from them).  Sometimes I think I tend to over-scrutinize desserts, given that I'm a pastry chef, but after my dad took a bite of his creme brulee he thought it was grainy (the custard part).  And my mom thought the smores mousse was too sweet (as did I).  It also had old marshmallows.    The wine - Great selection here with reasonable pricing.  The only thing I didn't like was the corkage fee.  But I'd rather pay a $10 fee than the extreme mark-up you'd be charged buying a bottle of champagne at other restaurants.  So it's still a win guys!!!  The atmosphere - Gorgeous.  So it's not a \"real\" lake and your view is of homes.  Doesn't matter.  Still beautiful.  And the restaurant is lit well and decorated nicely.  Plenty of heat on the patio as well.",

    "text": "My boyfriend reserved a table for tonight. They have a variety of wine selections. Even a \"wine enthusiast\" favorite. So we chose a Pinot Noir bottle while waiting to be seated. Our hostess was very friendly even though she mentioned it was her third day. She did a wonderful job of controlling the parties waiting to be seated.   It was a rainy day, we had no complaints but the hostess gave us a choice of patio or inside. We chose patio and she sat us by a cozy fireplace. At first it was lovely, just for our anniversary but then as it rained harder we started to get a little wet. We asked to move and they moved us with no problem.   Our server was also really nice. I believe his name was Anthony. It was our first time here and he was very patient. He explained the specials and opened our wine as we got settled.  We got the a green salad and cheese platter to start. Both were delicious! The cheese platter especially! It paired perfectly with our wine.  As we drank our server always poured for us which I thought was great attention to detail. As we finished our starter, they brought out our entree at the perfect time.  For our entree we ordered, the Scottish salmon and the lobster pasta. Both were also delicious and we very much enjoyed every bite!  As it came close to dessert we had a hard time choosing between tiramisu and the cheesecake. Since they were out of tiramisu, I just went ahead and ordered another wonderful cheese plate while my boyfriend got the cheesecake.   Overall, an awesome romantic experience.  Great wine and cheese, for you wine and cheese people.  And great service!",

We ordered their Fruit Crepe, Grits & Grillades and Lobster Croissant. The food came out in time. Not only the platter were beautiful, they were tasty and savory.  Imo, the tables were too close, we could hear everyone's conversations. Sure enough, the table next to us heard our conversations and started talking to us. Also, we were cold, and everyone else still had their jackets on.  This place is perfect for any occasions and esp beautiful place for a date night. I prefer sitting outside and enjoying the view.",

Most recently brunch at the gorgeous, somewhat new bar -- Bottomless mimosas with various fruit flavors to choose from (my favorite being Cassis) for $20 is a great deal. The Bloody Mary is spicy, thick, and huge! It also comes with a niece piece of bacon.   The escargot was salty, garlicky, and overall perfect. To make it even more perfect I dunked their delicious homemade bread into the unctuous, oily sauce after gobbling up all of my snails.   Chef's soup du jour is always outstanding. On this day it was a rich carrot ginger for which they accidentally brought us a second bowl and left it with the kitchen's compliments. Thank you!  Steak & Eggs - steak med rare and cooked PERFECTLY. This was a small, bistro style steak I am not even sure what the cut was. I do wish for the price the piece of meat had been larger. Eggs fluffy and scrambled, salty and crispy breakfast potatoes were also a hit.  Truffled Grits & Beef Medallions - served with an egg on top that once the yolk was broken oozed delightfully over the grits and beef. A very rich and satisfying dish although, again, I wish the portion were larger.  Fruit Crepe - for dessert, this was a combination of various types of seasonal fruits topped with a creme anglaise. Perfectly tarte and sweet, I ate the entire thing.  I have seen some reviews with complaints regarding the owner. He greeted me today as he does every time I dine in and has always been friendly.",

The servers are very hip to the menu and can help you choose what's best to eat depending on your feelings for flavor that evening. The restaurant is in the back of a wine shop where you can grab a bottle of wine and bring it to dinner with you... What could possibly be better  I highly recommend the cheese tray as a starter as it is the perfect complement to the wine. The candy peppers or something on like I've ever tasted. But we have been there several times as Desert Shores residence ourselves we recently took my parents there for a birthday celebration. My mother and father we're there for the first time and raved about the taste of the food and the quality of the service. There are restaurants to come and go in the desert Shores strip but this one is been there a while and for good reason... It's simply awesome.  Go support this restaurant so that it's here for many years to come. You will love it",

    "text": "I've eaten at Marche Bacchus on numerous occasions.  It is one of only a handful of restaurants in town, where you can sit on a lakeside patio.  The front of the restaurant is a wine bar and store.  One thing I love is, you can pick your bottle of wine from their store and enjoy it with your meal.    During my most recent trip, we went for lunch and shared the: (1) lump crab salad; and the (2) charred octopus.  Both of the dishes are great.  The crab salad was light and refreshing, but still had plenty of crab.  The octopus was perfectly cooked.  It was tender, but firm enough to maintain its form and lightly smokey from the char.  For main courses, we ordered the (1) roasted chicken & spinach salad; and (2) the forbidden rice with chicken.   The salad was a perfect blend with spinach, quinoa, walnuts, and cranberries.  It was a great mix of flavors and textures.  The risotto was creamy, but not overly gooey.  I was very impressed with the tastes.    The staff, as always, was very friendly and attentive.  This is the best place in town to enjoy a glass of wine and great meal on a lake.",

Luckily, we were seated with a great view of the lake. The staff was very helpful, and answered all of our questions. My friend has dietary issues, so she needs to ask a lot of questions, because of food allergies.   I ordered the Steak & Eggs, which were good. It was cooked exactly the way I wanted, though I wish the steak had a little more flavor. I can't say it was the best steak & eggs I've ever had, but ti was still very good. I feel that the best things about the restaurant are the atmosphere and the service. I have no problem coming back and trying other things on the menu. I've never been much of a brunch person, anyway. Perhaps I'll return for dinner, and try some wine!",

Quite spicy with a cocktail sauce taste, mostly from the horseradish. I couldn't decide between the bacon and eggs risotto or the truffle grits and beef. I asked the waiter if I they were small and if I could eat both and he said they were pretty big, so my wife, who had ordered the brioche French toast said she'd help me eat some so I ordered both   The risotto was the star of the show. It was so delicious with bacon bits sprinkled into the risotto and 2 poached eggs on top. I broke the eggs into the risotto and mixed it all up. It was so good I could have eaten another one  The beef and grits was also good but a little bland. Could have used some salt. Was good and we are it all but I would just get the bacon and risotto.   The French toast was good, was crusted with honey oats and served with maple syrup and whipped cream. My wife loved it. She had the wild ginger drink with tequila and said it was one of the best cocktails she's ever had  Service was excellent and we will definitely be back",

    "text": "SO, actually,  it's honestly 3/5 stars for the restaurant on a normal day.  i actually visited because of groupon deal --unlimited mimosa for 2, charcuterie plate, 2 entrees for $69. for the groupon deal, it was 4/5 stars...good deal for sunday brunch.  venue: quite romantic. the entrance just seems like a tired strip mall but the restaurant area is on a lake, adorned with lights. it's not the most beautiful lake (lined with tired 90's build looking tract homes) but a lake is still a lake in a desert like Vegas. I visited in the summer but i bet it's quite pretty for dinner in the fall.  service: prompt, friendly  bottomless mimosas:5/5 *LOVE* how can you go wrong with bottomless mimosas for brunch?   charcuterie plate:5/5 DELICIOUS. quite possibly the best charcuterie plate i've ever had. so many items on it and every single one of them were DELICIOUS. DEEELICIOUS. definitely coming back for this.  crab benedict:2/5: this kinda sucked. i mean the eggs were poached decently. but there was almost no crab. and it tasted like limp canned crab with no lovin. NOT impressed. and honestly, by the time i had the crab benedict, i was already 3 mimosas in and super happy with the charcuterie plate so i was in a generous mood. if i had ordered it sober, sans charcuterie, i probably would have sent it back.  truffle grits with steak: 3/5 truffled grits were fun. steak was meh. not a terrible disappointment, but not something i'd reorder  i doubt i'd return for a non-groupon brunch. however, i'd love to return for drinks and charcuterie or return for dinner in the fall. it's a very pretty venue, away from the glitz of the strip. i'd say overall a decent place for a date--romantic venue, food not memorable, but not so bad it'd ruin the date.",

The view is gorgeous and the patio tables are spaced nicely, so you can have a conversation and not hear the table next to you! They have outdoor fireplaces and heat lamps which helped me not get cold once!  We started off with a delicious heirloom tomato and balsamic vinegar salad (my fiance still raves about it) and I proceeded to have a steak with pomme frittes. Soo good! Even better was that we were able to use a gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.restaurant.com&s=8cac03c1efb29efee41b3411fe3b107de69265557b5804295adb319e7abd90ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>.

    "text": "I'm used to putting up with bad service when it comes to French cuisine.  There must be something about the ability to pronounce the food and wine so much better than their patrons that makes the waiters and managers so pompous.  Yet Marche Bacchus' food and wine do not justify the how utterly inconsiderate was the staff.  Tucked behind a wine shop on the beachhead of a very artificial lake, the restaurant is actually quite quaint with its mini gazebos and picturesque view.  Nature has been harnessed and brought tableside.  But the table layout certainly feels fun and romantic.    Wines by the glass are quite pricey.  You might as well reach to the \"reserve\" side of the menu for just a few dollars more.  The Rhone wines on the reserve list were very nice but nothing that quite justified the cost.  Others we tried throughout the night were all good but not great.  To me, the Frank's Family Cabernet may be the only wine worth its weight.  The escargot was wonderfully soft and had a surprising finish of citrus.  The foie gras was very nice and lighter than expected.  The charcuterie was fun and represented the last thing we would truly enjoy.  For the kitchen ran out of duck confit on this Sunday night.  The duck breast was so atrociously salty it made me think of flash fried spam.  And the tenderloin was overly salted and overcooked.  Thankfully, its wine reduction gravy saved the dish from being sent back.  Inconsiderate is the best way I can sum up the service we experienced.  The waiter did not listen.  He ran away from our table even when we yelled to him to bring him back.  Our requests went unfilled just as our water glasses went unfilled.  When one wine was no longer available, the manager himself brought out a completely different varietal (Shiraz, which many including myself find repulsive).  Without bothering to ask what other wine we would prefer at nearly $16 a glass, the manager just assumed that we would accept his subjective palate and judgment in lieu of our own as to which wine we would find most pleasing.  He plunked down the Shiraz and dallied away as if everything were wonderful.  Later, the waiter could not confirm whether the Shiraz I was given was the expensive Shiraz on the menu or some cheap substitute, so I naturally assumed it was the latter.  We sent back the Shiraz in lieu of another varietal and then reminded the staff that we had also asked three to four times for yet a different glass of wine for another guest in our party.  The manager again assumed that his foreign charm would make all amends, until we finally had to make clear by yelling in unison that there were still two outstanding wine orders that had not been fulfilled.  We then still had to remind the staff another three times for the wine, and finally received it at a freezing temperature.  The staff then disappeared altogether by the time we had begun our meals and we wanted to order a bottle of the freezing wine.   Needless to say, we left quite sober and thirsty from having neither enough wine nor water.  The denouement was the attempt to sort out the dinner coupon.  Aside from the comedy of errors that ensued in processing the coupon, the staff had the audacity to foist an 18% gratuity on our party of four.  Mon dieu!  We absolutely expect better from a restaurant that is supposed to know about fine wine and fine dining.  Attempting to placate a guest with Shiraz after running out of a completely different wine and without asking is just insulting.  That act alone exemplifies the different between knowing how to run a restaurant and just posing as if.",

    "text": "Date night...Marche don't let me down!  OK the time had come to finally give this place go. Made sure to have plenty of time, arrived early to enjoy the lake so here goes...  Concept - Wine Store with a twist. After arriving early and walking around the store for a few minutes we were seated on the patio with one of us having our backs to the lake, they quickly reseated us down by the small man made creek and the setting was perfect.  Service - Our waiter was terrific and didn't rush us, he knew we were there to relax and not be rushed.  Wine - They add $10 to any bottle of wine you purchase and drink there. I grabbed a nice $40 bottle to start and Marche was starting to live up to it's name...boy was this going to be a great night...  Appetizer - Plate of pate, cheeses, candied walnuts and a few other french delicacies and we were in the land of the sublime. Not a tourist in sight, just us locals enjoyed a lovely evening, feeling very far from the lights of the Strip.  Wine - Second bottle is opened and awaiting Shrimp & Grits for my better half and Duck for myself..Oh boy this is going to be so good and I just feel the 5 star review I am going to put on YELP!  OMG tell me it isn't so....  Dinner - AN ABSOLUTE DISASTER!  Most likely the roughest, grittiest Grits I have ever tasted. Shrimp had no flavor at all. The Chef was obviously not in the kitchen when this came out or he/she didn't taste prior plating. On the other hand the presentation of the dish along with the the general flavor maybe the Chef is just tasteless.  Duck is one of my favorite meals, done medium rare it's flavors and complexity can match any dish in the world. 3 things went wrong here:  1) The duck itself came our cold and I mean COLD. After returning twice, for exactly the same thing the third plate was actually the second plate microwaved...You have to be kidding me!!!!  2) It came with the most god awful stuffing mix that was bland, flavorless with no color at all. This stuff would not even have made a BAD Thanksgiving table.  3) Presentation was deplorable. No flare, just basic plates that weren't even warmed prior to plating, Really very disappointing indeed.  So we basically gave up on the dinner and asked for the check. Everything was still on there at full price, duck, grits, wine you name it. No managers effort to come over and offer to comp a dinner, take off the bottling charge, offer desert, absolutely nothing at all.  The bill was over $150, I tipped the waiter cash and asked him to present the check to management with my sincere disappointment. Upon leaving not a comment or thanks for coming.  So what appeared to start of as a new favorite place to go for date night will have a distinctly difficult time getting us back for a second try. Maybe a bottle of wine and cheese plate on a nice afternoon but as for dinner they need to really be careful or they will be back to being a wine store and deli.  Sorry Marche, you need some help.",

    "text": "Fantastic view and setting, but the outrageous prices don't match with the quality of food.  I had no idea that this area even existed in Las Vegas.  This has been on my food hit list for ages, and we finally made it out here a month or so ago for dinner, motivated with a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate.  While the certificate helps alleviate the tax and tip, you aren't really going to save much money with it.    Food is your typical french bistro food with a dabble of New Orleans cuisine, and props to them for having a nice wine shop where you can get up and pick out a bottle to bring to your table to drink.    We had the following: Soupe a l'oignon  - french onion soup.  This was a pretty bold soup, and  seemed heavier than most onion soups I have had.  But it was tasty.  L'Assiette Gourmande \"Bacchus\" - This had Imported Cheeses, Charcuterie,Lobster Salad, Mixed Olives, Apple & Quince Served with Artisan Bread.  I liked it mostly but wouldn't order it again, and I was not crazy about the Pate.  At $21 it seemed extremely expensive for what it was.  Marinated Roasted Beet Salad - this was a very very small dish, with a few slices of beets with Trout on top.  I liked it, because it is beets after all, but I wasn't blown away with it to drop $12 on it again.  Moules Frites - oh what a disappointment this was.  I was so looking forward to eating this the most, as after eating Mon Ami Gabi's delicious mussels, I thought this would be similar.  They were like night and day as far as quality.  As someone else has mentioned in their review, they serve the mussels in a bucket which makes the broth and everything else sink to the bottom, so you don't get any of that great flavor.  Additionally, I had many closed mussels in my pail, which means they were dead and should not be eaten.  So almost half of my dish was inedible.  They could very well make a patron very sick (enough to go to the hospital) with serving dead bivalves, so I was extremely upset that this was even served to me.  Peppercorn Fillet - My husband's entree and the winner dish of the night.  Tender, good quality, nice char, and flavorful.  However it is pretty small for a $40 steak and the accompanying sides are even more miniscule.  I would expect this price at the celebrity chef restaurants on the strip, but not here.  So I can't say I had an amazing meal here, but in the last week I saw one of Alex's former chef's and Mr. Stratta himself will be working here in some capacity, so the food will be revamped:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.eatinglv.com%2F2011%2F05%2Fthis-just-in-alessandro-stratta-consulting-at-marche-bacchus%2F&s=5993028c0672dd7c1959fb41c3b3d24cdf87f2d1509e5cf97d328fc290541dff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">eatinglv.com/2011/05/thi...</a>  I'll most likely give this place a try in the near future to see how the food has changed, assuming it is going to be improved.",

But I'm just shocked how the service was based on the good yelp reviews. Tonight we were a group of 12 girls, celebrating a girl friend's birthday. Our server Marty was nice at first, but seemed to be elsewhere at the rest of the meal. I understand we're a larger group, but he didn't ask if we were paying together or separate at the beg of the meal ( that's a no brainer in the food and bev industry with a larger group - I know it's annoying to, but still, for convenience of the group, obviously ppl have cards and cash ), it must be our fault because we forgot to state we wanted to split our bill at the end of the meal. Our appetizers, and salad didn't arrive at the same time, half of the groups arrived 10 mins later for a salad? No apologies on our server's part. As the salads were arriving, the entrees came. And what irked me, is when the server asked if we were ordering dessert, as I remembered I forgot to ask to split my check because my son was crying at home - he stated in a rude tone that we didn't say to split the check in the beg, and there was nothing he could do. As he was walking off, I could hear him make a snarky comment about the whole check splitting thing. In the end of a $400 bill for 12 girls, and that's including tax - it wasn't worth $36, and for me to give him a 15% tip, I shouldn't have. It was suppose to be a great night, but we literally wasted an hour and a half trying to figure out our check. There was a lot of should've, would've, could've with the service. I will not be dining again, and will not be referring my friends. Maybe it's good for a smaller group or another server other than Marty.",

I then proceed to pat myself on the back as I say \"Why yes, this is my Vegas.\" Thank God, the food match the ambiance or otherwise people would be pissed that I drag off the strip just for a good view.   If you're a wine drinker you already know this place. If you like French-American cuisine, this will be one of your favorites. Not a fan of escargot? Oh you will be. The waiters and I insist that you order the escargot yourself and not share. Even if you don't like escargot, just toss them slimy critters and dip your bread in the sauce, sit back savor the buttery goodness. They also make the best French burger and fries in Las Vegas. Make sure you ask for medium rare or else you won't like it. The meat is well seasoned with a strong smoky flavor that if served well done will taste more like beef jerky.   Great view and ambiance. Fantastic food. Good company. 4 hour lunch later, time for a Foot Spa.",

    "text": "Overall, a good experience, but let me break it down for you:  THINGS THAT WERE AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED  -Staff. Arguably the best. Authentic, attentive, knowledgeable, they did their job with ease. -Wine. Unreal selection. Variety of price ranges, with no scores below 85 (that I found).  -Food. So... freaking... good. These guys have French cuisine nailed.  THINGS THAT WERE NOT AS GOOD AS ADVERTISED  -THE VIEW. This is really what I came here to talk about. Yes, there is indeed a lake in the sense that there is water and things can float on it. It's more of a pond. It has an apartment complex overlooking it. It's not authentic at all. Completely overblown. -Romantic ambiance. The music was, eh. There were candles, I guess. There were a lot of events around us like weddings and receptions. But it was a small step above an average chain restaurant. I'd have to say in many cases I've seen chains do romance better. It's really just a place. -Price. Be prepared to throw down, especially if you order drinks.  I feel like you can do better for the price. The place is in a strip mall. Even a place in Red Rock casino up the street is going to do better.",

However, we were seated on an outdoor table right next to the plastic curtain which smelled disgustingly bad. I mean it was dirty as a restaurant. There were straws and some food wastes under the table. Anyways, I ordered Lobster salad croissant and my husband had Croque madame. Both dishes were very flat and funny. It was funny because they only used imitation crab meat for my 'Lobster' salad croissant... Since me and my husband lived quite long time in France, some times we miss those popular dishes like 'Croque monsieur / madame'. We both thought their version was the worst. We came here because I heard good things about the quality of their food and pretty lake side setting. Unfortunately, we could't experience none of them. Very disappointed.",

    "text": "Only two things kept me from giving this place a 5 star.  The first was that they were out of Duck Confit Cassoulet, and I was looking forward to that.  The second was, as we were trying to decide on dessert, a large group, obviously regulars, and  \"important people were seated next to us.  They were VERY loud, but having a good time.  One of the owners, a lovely, charming lady, spent a good deal of time chatting with them, adding to the volume.  But the restaurant should be judged on service and food (though the view was wonderful).  Though disappointed about the duck confit, I was about to order the  Loup De Mer (sea bass), when the waiter suggested the Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast .  I went with that, and was not at all disappointed.  Perfectly cooked, and the port candied pearl onions were a treat.  My companions both had the Seared Sea Scallops, and they too were perfectly prepared, and delicious.  Our waiter was excellent, making good suggestions, and being attentive, but not overly so.  We had excellent wine (bought 5 bottles on the way out-good price too), good food, good service, and though spendy, well worth the price.  We'll be back.",

    "text": "Went there last night for the first time. After a few bumps on the road we made a reservation at 8:30PM for the 2 pf us, of course, requesting patio seating. Called at 7:30 PM to confirm the reservation and Jen (the hostess) said everything was OK, they had our reservation in the system. Well, we get there and the hostess says \"oh, did you make the reservation online? We haven't been getting them and unfortunatelly, we are fully booked for the evening\". Now, normally, if that was the case, they should still acomodate it since a reservation was made ahead of time and it is not my fault opentable is not communicating with them. Thankfully, when I mentioned reservation was confirmed with jen (I assume that was her) she looked at her computer and said \"oh, there you are\". Hmmm, a little suspicious, but we were told it will be a couple min before we are seated. We were ok with that, since we wanted to browse the wine selection. She came and checked in on us several times, letting us know our table is almost ready. We approched someone (I assume he was a manager, since he did not wear uniform, but had a nametag) and asked for wine recommendations. He was very helpfull and recommended a great vintage bottle of Pinot Noir which we both loved! Also,he was the one to walk us to our table. it was not right on the water, but all tables we fully commited and we didnt mind it. We never got a menu and had to ask for one, which was OK since we assumed it was because we were walked to our table not by the hostess who normally handes out menus. We asked for one and got it very fast.  We odrered the steak tartare for appetizer and it was anazing! My husband had the King salmon and I had the steak frites coked exactly as I requested. We alse shared the bread pudding (per the recommendation of our waiter). The total bill was $130 before tip, so about $150 including everything.  The service was above average, since the waited didnt introduce himself, but he did check on us regurarly. Overall, this is one of my favorite restaurants in Las Vegas and that's a lot coming from a local. So, if you are reading this review and thinking about going, just do it! Focus on the food and ambiance and enjoy! Oh, and definetelly get a bottle of wine :)",

The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is because she was the only one answering the phone, seating people & pouring wine, so there was a wait to be seated, and quite a wait for our wine. There is a beautiful glassed in outdoor patio overlooking a lake, with a fireplace. We requested a table there & it was lovely. Our server, Jason was attentive & helped with the wine selection. My daughter & husband chose to share 3 3oz pours of their reserved wines. It is nice you can get a taste of these special wines without purchasing the whole bottle. We also had a cheese plate with 5 cheeses, nuts, grapes & candied pepper strips& that really complemented the wine. It was a nice way to spend an hour or so. They serve full meals also.",

    "text": "Oh, what happened to this wonderful desert gem? I should have realized what I was in for when they got fancy with the pronunciation of their name! (We all say bacchus, but they now answer the phone with Ba-koos.) The \"No, we really ARE French\" theme continued with the waiter's fake French accent, which faded in and out, getting REALLY annoying when he was overwhelmed.  We arrived after making a reservation a month earlier, and still couldn't get a decent table. We asked to be by the water, but the area where we were first seated had no shade. The mister system was out - management blamed that on a customer. We were seated inside, though I went here to be seated by the water. (We are repeat customers, and always go on Bastille Day; this year I took a group of 6 women for Sunday Brunch the day before.) My daughter had to wait over 10 minutes to pay for a bottle of wine, and she was the only person purchasing. After waiting over an hour for our meals, the waiter brought out 2 more charcuterie trays \"on the house\". Never mind that we still had the first 2, largely untouched because they were pretty lousy.  The bottomless mimosas were great, and they did keep filling our glasses. At one point, it was to distract us from the fact that we'd asked for bread 3 times and it still wasn't delivered to our table. I had to ask for orange juice in my mimosa, even though I'd already had 2 in the same glass. The meal finally arrived, and the food was delicious. My Black Truffle Oil Grits with Beef Grillades was incredibly good, and everyone loved their meals. We were just all profoundly saddened by the disappointing experience at one of our favorite restaurants. The manager offered his card so that he could make it up to us with a free appetizer next time; I declined, as my friend has his card from the last time he came and had a terrible experience! I hope they pull their act together.",

    "text": "THIS restaurant bleeds romance, particularly with outdoor seating between the hours of 8 - 10pm. I chose this restaurant to celebrate my two year anniversary because I didn't feel like dealing with the strip, the people of the strip, the parking, and the crowds.   I called a week ago and asked for a table on the patio. We ended up being seated at the best table in the house. (I will upload a picture). The hostess sat us at our table, which was literally 10 feet from the lake that the restaurant overlooks. The lighting was dim and there are beautiful trees and plants and candles everywhere. There was also a man singing wonderful Sinatra-style covers and his voice was absolutely beautiful. I couldn't get over how amazing he sounded and I also appreciated the fact that the live music wasn't too loud or distracting. It was calming and pretty, unlike a lot of restaurants where the band/singer is right in your face crooning as loudly as can be.   We chose a bottle of wine from their store to go along with our meal. Although they do charge a $10 corking fee on top of the price, this particular wine still ended up costing at least $10-20 less than it does at other restaurants.   Our waiter, Joe, was incredibly nice, friendly, and attentive. He didn't bother us too much but also came around when appropriate and his menu recommendations were spot on. We started with the Bacchus cheese and meat platter. I'll be honest, I can't remember what the hell kind of cheese and meat were on it, but everything tasted great. There were at least three different cheeses, two different pates, some apples, applesauce, and a bunch of meats. Very nice!  I ordered the Crispy Maple Duck Leaf Breast and my girlfriend ordered the Steak Frites. We also ordered a side of brussel sprouts.  The duck was the best I have ever had, hands down. It was cooked perfectly and came with this amazing sauce that perfectly complimented the crispy, juicy, flavors of the duck. Unbelievably good - so much so that I ate the entire plate! Also, I am a HUGE fan of brussel sprouts, I cook them at least three times a week at home, and these were also up there with the best I've ever had. They were tender and salty with bursts of bacon flavor. YUM. Must order! I sampled my girlfriend's steak and it was tender and cooked perfectly. I have had better, but she really enjoyed it.   For dessert, we had the bread pudding. IMPECCABLE. I was expecting something different because this bread pudding looked and was textured more like coffee cake, but it was delicious! It came with a sauce, I can't remember what it was called, but dipping the warm bread pudding into the slightly cool sauce created flavor explosions of cinnamon and warm cakey goodness.   Overall, I couldn't have had a better night. The vibe was calm and inviting. It was romantic. The lake was beautiful. The music was perfect and the food was to die for. Eating here made me feel like I was on vacation rather than living in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "If you know me, my thing is dessert. Yes, I'm all about it. I don't treat myself to it a lot so when I do, it's got to be worth the caloric intake. So when I was selecting where to dine during Restaurant Week, what I looked at on all the dinner menus was dessert offerings. When I stumbled upon Marche Bacchus' menu, the dessert option of tiramisu or creme brulee got me. We made reservations for 7pm and off we went.   For the ambience, this is a 5-star place.  The wine shop at the entrance is beautiful and reminiscent of the finest wine shops in Napa. We got there as the sun was setting so being by the water, with the fairy lights on,  was just gorgeous. We sat by the bridge connecting one side of the outside dining area to the other. Next to us was a table of two clearly waiting for two more people.   The host told us \"Robert\" would be by soon to get our food and drink order. About 5 minutes later, Robert came by. He rattled off the specials and took our order. I ordered the soup, chicken, and tiramisu. The BF ordered soup, salmon, and creme brulee. I also ordered a glass of wine. Robert wrote nothing down then went on his merry way. Not the warmest of servers we've had but whatever. We were finally brought water and bread. Needed the water as it has now been about 15 minutes from when we were initially seated. And although the sun was setting and we were by the water, it was still hot. Another 10 minutes went by before Robert came over with my wine. He was holding the wine in a small carafe and, I am not exaggerating, he literally dumped the wine into my glass and off he went without saying a word. It was about this time that the table I mentioned earlier, two people waiting for another couple, that the other couple walked in and joined their friends. (This is going somewhere. Promise)  5 minutes later, another server brought a cheese/nut/fruit plate that came with the menu. The candied walnuts were crunchy and sweet, the gouda was gooda (sorry), and the pears with mustard were a good balance of sweet and savory.   Table next to us ordered apps.  After our cheese plates were taken away, Robert came back with the soup. Carrot-ginger soup. This was really, really good. Super smooth and a great balance of carrots and ginger. I ate the whole bowl.   Table next to us got their apps.  Frankly, if we stopped right there, I'd give this place a 4 (taking a star off due to service). The food and ambiance could make this my #1 go-to nice dinner spot. But, alas, the night was about to get bad...  We waited at least 30 minutes between our soup bowls being cleared and finally getting our entrees. What happened during those 30 minutes is what would ultimately send my BF through the roof.   Table next to us ordered dinner. We waited.  We kept waiting. Here came Robert. Walking to our table I was sure to apologize for the delay with our food. Wrong. He walked to the table next to us and apologized for the delay. At this point, we'd been waiting a good 20 minutes, they'd been waiting maybe 8. Surely he will do the same to us after leaving their table, right? Wrong again. He disappeared for another 10 minutes. I saw him peeking over his area a few times but he failed to even acknowledge us. When he finally came out, he was walking over, tray in hand, with some small bowls. He knocked into the chair next to my boyfriend to make some room for himself as he delivered to our neighbors a bowl of something-or-the-other, compliments of the chef, to \"make up for the delay.\" Was this really happening?? So, I was sure, we'd get something similar. Instead, we got nothing. The guy didn't even acknowledge us. Unbelievable. This is when I started regretting picking this place for dinner. But damn you, Tiramisu. I was going to stick this out for you.   Now we're 30 minutes between clearing of soup bowls and dinner. Finally, here comes dinner!! Only it's not Robert making the delivery so we accepted the food without complaint. Our neighbors got their food at the same time. My chicken was nicely cooked. The potato/mushroom medley was delicious. The salmon  was nothing extraordinary. I purposely ate only half my entree so I could stuff my face with Tiramisu. When Robert came over to clear our plates, he said they were out of Tiramisu. ARE YOU KIDDING ME? That's bad enough standing alone but he waited until now to tell me?  Unbelievable. Then he asked if he could bring me a creme brulee. Is that my only option, I asked? Yes.   Finally, my BF told Robert all the things that had gone wrong that night. Robert responded with, it's busy, sorry you felt ignored. The manager came over and had a similar attitude: let's blame it on the kitchen and they were busy.  $125 for a party of 2 at a nice place with good food and service, is fine. $125 for good food but terrible service assures we will not be back. The owners need to clean house. Such a shame because the ambience is so distinctive from anything else in off-Strip LV.",

The restaurant is right on the lake and they still use real candles on the table and the ceiling lights was just perfect. Very relaxed and quiet. The service was amazing as always, and our waiter knows all the wines they have inside out.   PEPPERCORN FILET MIGNON  Pan Seared Beef Tenderloin with a Creamy  Peppercorn Sauce & Potato Gratin  The steak was good, but no surprises. If you like really simple tasting steak, this would be ideal. The potato gratin was done beautifully and super creamy.   GRILLED VEAL CHOP  Served with Truffled Gnocchi, Wild Mushrooms &  English Pea Coulis  The Veal chop itself was perfect. However, the gnocchi was too soft, and obviously fresh made. Couldn't really taste the truffle at all.   Honestly, the entire meal was tiny bit disappointing because the previous experiences had been absolutely perfect.",

We happened to get there in time to watch the sun set and the stars come out.  Oh my what a setting beside the little lake.  The mister system keeps you cool while you enjoy your evening.  Sitting on the patio feels like you are in a villa in some other country.  It is so quaint.  There is a retail wine store connected to the restaurant so that you can go and shop for your bottle of wine and have that with your dinner and take the remainder home with you.  We had a nice Pinot Grigio because of the hot weather.  We were served with french bread to start.  We had Steak Frites with fries.  This is a hangar steak with Bordelais.    We also shared Lobster and Corn Agnolotti.    Hands down the best meal of the two was the Steak Frites.  It was cooked to perfection and the first morsel to the last was so enjoyable you just had to close your eyes and savor all that flavor bursting in your mouth.  Oh if every steak bite could taste like this!  The Lobster and Corn Agnolotti did have lobster but very little of it.  The pasta was definitely a sweet taste which was an unexpected twist but it worked.  It was balanced by the Chanterelle mushrooms.  I am not sure where the corn was in the dish, maybe it was pureed?  Overall it was a pleasing dish but not one I would rave about like I do the Steak Frites.  This is definitely a restaurant I want to be a regular at.  It is a very nice experience.  Au Revoir",

It was warm when we got there because the sunlight was hitting on our table, but soon as the Sun went down, it got really chilly.  Our waitress was super nice. Food was also excellent. I would totally come back here again!",

    "text": "Update:  they now have a gluten free lunch menu!  Enjoy!  ***  Such a wonderful spot.  Love dining there.  The view, the wine list, the attentiveness, the renovations they've done so carefully, the ducks...  But am a little frustrated. I made sure to discuss my dietary issues with the owner and hostess as I entered and was thrilled when they proudly handed me a menu with gluten free options - yay!  I know they have a talented kitchen, but it just makes me feel better to know it's part of their training, their daily conversation with staff and kitchen.    But after I ordered, the manager came out to the table saying \"don't know why the hostess gave you the gf menu, that's only for evening. We don't have a gluten free menu during the day...\"   Well - I'm sorry, but I'm gluten free all day long.    So they still have some work to do.  Particularly since after detailed conversationS with both the server and the manager, the kitchen sent out the tomato salad with bread, dairy, fruit (in dressing) and starch on it which only tells me they're either not listening, or they don't care.  And I want to give them more credit than that because I know that's not how the owner would want them to treat their guests.  So then entree comes - and it's just ok.  Why?  because I didn't really trust the kitchen at this point - but I was so hungry I ate every bite.  Fortunately no issues.  Which is why I only dinged them one star.",

    "text": "Destiny and Destination. Both come into play when you are dining in this paradise of a location in Desert Shores. Upon entering Marche Bacchus you are instantly reminded from whence the name was first envisioned. Bacchus, the playful God of wine. The restaurant has many wines to sample, some of extraordinary vintage, to buy and take home or to accompany your meal with a modest corkage fee. The food is an eclectic mix of French cuisine, I'll sometimes stop in for a early dinner cheese tray paired with a nice white, and the servers are generally knowledgeable about pairings, and, if unsure,  they are not above asking for assistance from one of the managers or owners. The French Onion Soup is a guilty pleasure of mine and Bacchus does it splendidly. They also serve a variety a fowl not often seen on a menu along with tasty tarts to finish the meal. Don't  pass the chance to go when they have live entertainment as that makes you feel like you can't possibly be in Vegas.  This must be as a dream with swans gliding by and birds calling out to one another. This is the kind of romantic spot to take your significant other to and it won't cost you an arm and a leg. The arm will suffice nicely. Snails are always a good bet when you go to a French restaurant and they do them well with just the right mix of butter, wine, and herbs. They could use a little more garlic in the presentation but that is really being nit-picky. Lose yourself on the veranda overlooking the lake and the tranquil movements of nearby, but not threatening in any way, wildlife. Marche Bacchus, I will see you soon!",

Delicious French/Italian cuisine that is not pretentious.  Sit at the large bar inside for a casual drink, or dine on the lake for an al fresco experience with beautiful views.  You would never know you were in Las Vegas.  The wine selection here is spectacular!  Lots of hard to find bottles from small Northern California vineyards, as well as more popular labels fill the indoor shop.  The prices are extremely reasonable and the wait staff is friendly and attentive.  A guitarist was playing when we were there, but he was a nice accent to the meal, without being overly intrusive.

Had to wait 30 minutes just to get waters, we watched the waiter serve every table but ours, asked twice for water and he forgot, as well as the mimosas that were ordered. Food was alright, although our order was messed up, however instead of doing anything about it by that point it was easier to simply eat it and not complain as we couldnt wait another hour for our mistake to be corrected. At times we felt bad as it was only one waiter for all of the tables. We did ask the person brining our food for water, but he simply walked back inside.  The manager didn't seem to be helping much as he was busy on his phone most of the time.   The location is nice, but I was so upset by the service it ruined it. If you want to be upmarket, or trendy, or even have wine on offer, perhaps the staff should offer it, or at the very least say hello to the guests.",

With the first gorgeous Saturday upon us, we didn't waste the opportunity to take it all in.  Lucky for us, we now live around the corner from Marche.  There was a 10 minute wait for patio seating when we arrived, just enough time to pick out the perfect wine.  We opted for an unoaked chardonnay from the refrigerator.  I also highly recommend the Charles Ellnor champagne that they usually have in stock.  If you're feeling like an adventure, enlist in a recommendation or 10 from the wine store staff.

We had two kids with us and when we asked for two kid menus they brought one when we ask for two we asked for another and the manager said \"would you like me to read it?\" We aren't asking for the kid menu to read it, it's for our kids pleasure. I mean really? Then we had ordered our apps and courses after about 15-20 minutes they come to the table and asked about the entree I ordered and he says \"I'm sorry but my server just got called in and when she took the order she didn't know we didn't have the salmon Benedict but don't worry I got you the crab Benedict\". I didn't want that and I said that is not ok at which point I didn't even want the food but I got a different plate but at that time everyone else already was getting there food like for real? Why couldn't you tell me when you got the order in the back of the house isn't that the standard?..... so everyone eats and then I get my food wasn't really what I wanted but there it is yes they did comp my plate but I'm not looking for a free meal I went there for the service/food. So we end the disaster of and experience. It felt like they were short staffed and we ended up taking to the manager and all he could say was oh I'm sorry we were not prepared to get this busy and two of our servers called In sick like why is that our problem. We came there to enjoy a birthday and it sucked they even charged a corkage fee for bottles we bought with them the manager didn't even care which is great smh I will never go back to this restaurant just because of the service....smh",

It doesn't feel like you are anywhere near the strip!  I went most recently last weekend (6/22/13) and as with all previous visits, I was not disappointed. You walk in through a wine shop (they do not serve hard liquor, but who would want it with their fabulous wine selection?), so you get to walk through and pick out your own wine. Throughout the meal when it is time for another bottle, you can either go back to pick it out or they will make suggestions. All of their wine is very reasonably priced compared to most restaurants. Also, if you have a bottle that they don't sell, you can bring it and just pay corkage.  The food is always fantastic. Unfortunately, they removed the lobster pot pie from the menu a few years ago, but they have other lobster mains that are just as amazing. The duck is one of my favorites. The pastas are amazing. For dessert, definitely order the bread pudding!! I have never tried anything here that I didn't like, and to make it better...the prices are extremely good for what you get. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Since I had eaten here a day before Valentine's Day, I can understand that this place was extremely busy. So I won't say too much about the long wait time for seating and dining.   However, I have been a hostess before. So normally when a guest checks into a restaurant and that if you ask them to wait in the waiting area, you should write a small description what each group looks like next to their name. Here, the hostess would literally ask all the group in the waiting area if their last name was so and so. Of course I over heard this one guest said \"No, I am not them but I've been here for 20 minutes and not sat down yet\"....,,,that could of been easily avoided! Me and my boyfriend had reservation at 8 but didn't get sat until 20 minutes later, so I guess a reservation here doesn't mean too much for them. Also the bartender was the first person you see when you walk in and she takes down your name too. She was seriously emotionless and only said ok. No greetings, welcome, or a smile. Well maybe you shouldn't be the first person diners should see when they enter.   I am giving this place a 4 star because of the whole dining atmosphere. It is different and probably something you won't find anywhere else in vegas. There's nothing better than drinking a glass of wine next to a beautiful lake. Such a romantic feel and location. They also have a long list of wines as well as wine bottle selection that can be purchased in the waiting area and can be brought to your table to enjoy.   As for the food, their steak Tar tar and duck breast salad were on point. Flavorful, clean, and just the right amount to share. But I am sad to say I didn't enjoy my main dish, braised short rib ravioli. It was creamy and thick, with no flavor. My boyfriend enjoyed his salmon plate though!  As for the service, they were nice but not as friendly as other places I've been too.",

Made reservations for Christmas. Ordered the Bacchus cheese plate but ended up with the artisan...it was a sad excuse especially for $18. There were maybe 4 pieces of cheese, 3 grapes and two hard pieces of raisin bread.   Duck salad tasted nothing like I was expecting but maybe because my favorite salad in the world is the duck salad at Hakkasan...this one doesn't even compare and the dressing didn't pair well with the overall taste of the rest of the salad.   French onion soup is just that, average. I ordered a daily special of Chilean sea bass which the waitress said was amazing. It wasn't. It was good but that was about all I can say about it.   The tiramisu was okay too tasted more sweet than coffee-like. Overall, the food is really quite average and I think my favorite part was the wine choice (a Riesling kabinett) and the bread brought at the beginning of the meal. With that said though, I will be back in spring to try the brunch because I love the ambience especially when it starts to warm up.",

    "text": "The patio seating is BEAUTIFUL! A friend of mine and I went in for a late lunch/early dinner on a rainy rainy day. The little lake that we sat next to had ducks and geese. Simply breathtaking.   As we got in, the hostess informed us that they were switching from the brunch menu to the dinner menu and that we wouldn't be able to order until 4pm. She asked if we still wanted to be seated and we said yes. She told us she would bring a menu to us at 4. I don't understand why we weren't able to get it before just to take a look at it but okay. Also, until we got our 4pm dinner menu, we weren't served any bread while we waited for the kitchen though other tables around us were already eating, it's only common that we should be served at least some bread while we sipped our wine. Maybe that's not how they do it. I don't know. Being a first time customer there, we didn't know that if we wanted to get a bottle of wine, we'd have to get up and grab one and bring it to the table. Our server finally informed us of that so we took off to search for the perfect bottle to match our to be perfect meal. The wine, was great. We had a few different plates to share and I was so excited for the foie gras. Unfortunately, I was also pretty disappointed. I have had many foie in my life, this... wasn't what I expected. The server, after telling him our disappointment, told us we should have gotten the seared foie.... Why he didn't suggest it when we ordered the \"wrong\" foie, is beyond me. The duck breast we had was very tasty. The seared salmon was a little thick on the crispy greasy end. The salad... kind of pathetic. The pate on the sampling plate was however, probably the single best thing I tasted that evening besides the wine.  Service was casual, but not first time friendly so do your research before you go here. I will say, they have one of the most serene view in vegas.",

I will be going back, because this is a great establishment, but I am also writing this because I want this to continue to be a great establishment.  To become an even better establishment in fact.  I work in the industry, so yes I do have higher standards than most when it comes to dining, but I usually ignore most of my critical thinking in such terms in favor of enjoying my experience.  Some things however, are unacceptable.  The extent of which your patio had spider webs, under the table, on the chairs, and on the ceiling is beyond unacceptable.  I understand it is outside and next to the water, making that a challenge, but it is a challenge that comes with such a space.  I imagine the investment in a power washer would be wise.  Especially since your patio is essentially your prime seating area.  If you get nothing from reading this, get that.  In terms of service, some things need to happen.  First, and more important than anything else as far as improving service at your establishment goes, is seating points.  It hasn't happened every time I have eaten there, but the one time it did happen was rediculous.  The server painfully, obviously, had either no regard or no idea what seating points are.  EVERY dish that was delivered to our table was auctioned off.  EVERY dish.  Not one, not a few, not a majority.  All of them.  That is insane to me.     There were other little things that I am not going to get into because I don't want to sound like an anal bastard, and because I am in the industry, I feel disgusted that I have to even write this review as I do really love your place.  I wasn't going to write this, or post this, because I love your place.  Then I realized that is the exact reason why I need to.  Because I will be coming back there again, and I hope these two glaring issues are taken care of.  I don't want my next visit to be my last.",

    "text": "Another of my favorites. Great food and great wine at reasonable prices. I always take guests from out-of-town here after we have been to a few places on the Strip. They are amazed. It is located on a manmade lake in Northwest Las Vegas. Most of the seating is outside by the lake, but with a fireplace, heaters, and misters, one is always comfortable.  They have a complete wine store with good prices and a $10 corkage fee--very reasonable compared the what they charge on the Strip for wine.   The owners are almost always on the premises. My sister noticed an attractive and well-dressed woman clearing and setting one of the tables. I told that was the boss and she was very impressed. They go out of their way to ensure that you have a great experience.   I would call the menu French-inspired. They have many traditional  French dishes, with a good number of standard American staples--something for everyone.",

    "text": "One of the most un-Vegas dining experiences around.  I never thought this kind of place would be in Summerlin of all places!!  The lake atmosphere was certainly the highlight of the experience...what is it with dining in front of a body of water that makes the experience so much better??  Menu was interesting..I wouldn't say it was French but it was decent.  I had the appetizer of the day which was duck with cornmeal, bleu cheese and jalapenos which was a very interesting and unique combo.  My wife got the onion soup which was certainly different.  The broth was the thickest of any onion soup we had seen and the waitress was saying the veal stock they use makes quite a difference in the taste.  Pretty robust but really good..perfect for dipping the bread into.    We were in a meat kinda mood so we got the filet and veal which were both great.  Too stuffed for dessert.  Definitely want to try the meat/cheese plates next time..maybe for lunch.  Saving $25 from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> was awesome too.      Wine store is great..we're not wine connoisseurs at all so just got a bottle that was reaonsably priced.  Great place to getaway from Vegas for a couple of hours.",

I truly enjoy the view from their patio seating lakeside, and the music on Friday nights.    Marche Bacchus is a great choice for those who want a bottle of wine with a great meal.  I love eating here because the food is always excellent, the wine choices are fantastic, and I get to watch the twilight dancing on the lake as the sun sets.  You don't need to dress up to eat here; just bring your appetite.    Some of my favorites are the duck, escargot, any of his specials, and the tenderloin.  The other night I had the duck and it was delicious.  I drank a bottle of Monchoff and then called it a night.  Although the bill isn't cheap for two (with wine and tax it was $102 the other evening + 20% tip) it's worth every penny.",

Food was blah.  Tomato bisque - not good at all and cold.  French onion soup was thick like pudding and came cold to the table as well.  Prices?  $45 for a $17.99 bottle you can get at Total Wines??

    "text": "What a fantastic place we discovered several years ago when I was looking to find a romantic place to take the GF.  Now that we live on this side of town, this has truly become one of our staples.  The diver scallops the GF ordered the first time we ever went were some of the best we have ever had.  The seasoning, the buttery texture, and the taste were all perfect.  It is located inside the Desert Shores neighborhood, so it has its own little charm.  It resides sitting on one of their man made lakes, and all of the dining is outside overlooking the lake.  The ambiance is wonderful with little cobblestone bridges and the like.  Lately on the weekends they have been having the new singer from Zowie Bowie provide music, and she really adds to the surroundings with her very lovely songs.  Very Romantic.  The inside also happens to be a wine shop.  They are going to have wines here that are different from what you can get at Lee's and Total.  If you buy a wine from their retail shop, it is only $10 extra to drink there with dinner, so you are not paying the exorbitant markup you do at most restaurants.  On Mondays the $10 fee is waived.  On Saturday's at 11:30 AM, they do free wine tastings with excellent selections every week.  Make sure to go then and have your palette entertained by Alan who oversees the tastings.  His knowledge of wines is incredibly impressive, which is only outdone by his patience and willingness to help you find the perfect wine you are looking for.  Feel free to ask him questions, he will not lead you astray!    What makes this place so good is that they make you feel welcome and special.  It seems like everyone you meet there that has been more than once all tells you that they feel like a VIP there.  The owners and staff somehow manage to make everyone feel like a VIP, and when you are going out to enjoy a wonderful meal or a great date night to spend your hard earned money, that extra little recognition and service goes a long way.  Highly recommended.",

I wish they would cooperate with their guests request like the ability to also serve lunch specialties daily including weekends like Sunday. For someone who doesn't live here and is on a weekend visit and would like to try the restaurant for what it's known for they can't cuz of whatever reason they have etc etc. I ended up not ordering anything else as I was simply looking forward to their foie gras. I wanted to leave but my bf made me stay. I guess my expectations are higher from restaurants cuz my experience in French restaurants in LA is just impeccable, they're more accommodating and value the experience of their guests. Well food was wasn't all that bad, steak was too much salt and pepper (I tried from my bf, didn't order it) I actually didn't order anything. When we were done, I walked out the restaurant and not the hostess or anyone even said thank you or anything. I certainly won't recommend my friends who constantly travel and go to fine restos as they're expectations would be same as mine nor I will return here anyway. It's too bad I really was looking forward to this place.",

    "text": "WORST SERVICE EVER  I hate giving bad reviews but there is no excuse for my experience. We came here for Mother's Day. Had a reservation set but didn't manage to be seated for over 30 minutes after our reserved time. Once we were seated we didn't see our server for over 10 minutes- this means we didn't even have water to sip on while we waited.   Once we were given our water and menus- we didn't even have the chance to order for another 15-20 min as our server disappeared again.   Long story short we finally ordered our food (took another hour or so before we received it), and they brought me the wrong thing. They \"quickly\" fixed it and got me the correct food. It was mediocre (at most) and I didn't even finish it. It looked/tasted like they gave me a dried out hamburger bun by wonder bread (you know... Hostess brand).   When we got the bill they charged us for the incorrect order and we had to point it out to them.   In all fairness they tried to right the wrong and took my item off as well as their required 18% gratuity. But even with the comp'd food, our bill was still over $200.   Their desserts were amazing BUT definitely not worth $200 for a chocolate crunch.   The entire dinner was 3 hours long. And it wasn't long because we finished eating and decided to talk. We were WANTING to leave but we hadn't even received out meal yet.   Btw it wasn't that busy so I can't says \"well it was a holiday and they were busy\".  This place needs to get its act together as I've seen places like Olive Garden that are more organized and efficient than this place. And I refuse to eat at Olive Garden.   I will NEVER return to this place. I wish the business best of luck and hope they learn from this experience so they may be better for the next customer who decides to eat here.",

    "text": "Yikes. After quite a nice meal here two years ago, I organized a brunch for my mommy group and the service was really pretty bad:/ We had a reservation for a party of 8 and after being sat waited 45 minutes to order, then subsequently had to wait and wait and wait each time we asked for so much as a refill on water. Twice a porter came to refill waters and then walked off with several of the glasses still empty- never to return with more water! We asked for our checks in the middle of the meal because we could foresee it being a looooooong wait, and unfortunately we were right. When the manager came over to ask how everything was, my friend mentioned that the service was really, really slow. He seemed surprised and eventually told us that it was because we needed separate checks. When we (nicely!) let him know that every aspect of the service had been slow, not just the check-getting portion, he mentioned the separate checks again and blamed our wait on an outdated computer system. When he came back 15 minutes later to find us still waiting he told us he had comped our bottomless mimosas due to the wait - which was nice of him! Only...none of us had had bottomless mimosas ($20), although 4 of the 8 had had single mimosas ($8). We all said thank goodness that we had ordered the singles, because I can't imagine how long we would have waited for a refill on the bottomless ones.  I do understand that separate checks are not ideal (when I organize a group outing elsewhere in the future I will definitely remind everyone about bringing cash) but they can't treat separate checks like some sort of puzzling phenomenon that has never been encountered before. And the separate check situation just doesn't excuse the long waits and poor service in every other regard.",

I know this because I was the General Manager for 2 P.F. Chang's in town. I woke up every Mother's Day morning residing the fact that I will have to do some apologizing that day and I will do my best to address every issue and put out every fire. I will comp what I need to, and beg for forgiveness when someone's experience is ruined. My biggest complaint here is that at no time did any manger stop by to check on us. We sent back ice cold dishes, ticket times were absurd (2:15 dining time with kids) and a kid entree brought out 20 minutes before anyone else got served (we did not request that). We had to get our desserts to go and left a 10% tip! With all of these GLARING RED FLAGS to management, not a single person stopped by to say anything, let alone apologize.  Once again, yes things will go wrong and yes management actually has the power and the obligation to recover the guest.  At what point does the manager at this restaurant step in? What other signs do they need?   I will never ever be back on principal alone. Yes, the wine prices, food, and view are lovely, but not worth the incompetence of the management.   Good Luck, you are going to need it.   Brien McEahern",

    "text": "Where do I begin?? My husband and family and I have been coming to MB for years; we even had our wedding rehearsal dinner here, but it has just continued to go down hill. This is what happened yesterday:   1. When I arrived on time for my reservation, there were only two tables occupied on the upper patio, but the hostess proceeded to sit me at an end table right near the walkway, crammed in by the planter. Certainly this was not a table anyone would want to sit at unless it was the only option.  The waiter moved my table upon request.   2. My father was served water and asked for lemon. Upon waiting about 10-15 minutes for lemon my mother had to literally summon the waiter to our table to request the lemon again. His response, \"It is being cut.\"  It seems very odd that an hour in to brunch service they don't have lemon already cut.    3. I ordered a cup of coffee, it took 20 minutes to get a plain cup of coffee.   4. We asked for bread with our mussels, which a nice waiter/busser brought, but only after telling us that the new manager said no bread with brunch service.    5. My dad's \"french toast\" might as well have been bread and jam.  It was dry, bland, and cold.   6. The manager came to refill my mimosa and overflowed champagne all over my place settings, but he did not return with a towel to clean it up. Instead I had to take napkins from the empty table next to us.   7. My brother ordered the crab and asparagus benedict, which is on the menu, but was brought what looked like a sloppy regular eggs benedict, which is not even on the menu.  Upon receiving the correct meal, his eggs were so undercooked that he could not even eat it.  This is not only a lack of concern for customers, but a serious health risk. You would think that given the recent salmonella outbreak at a different restaurant, they would be extra cautious when serving food. The table next to ours sent their meal back as the eggs were far too undercooked too.    8. When I finally got up to speak with the manager inside, he was snotty and rude, which I can only assume is a trait he learned from the owners who spend more time drinking wine with customers than managing their restaurant.   9. Upon receiving the bill, my brother's benedict was still on the check.  Considering it was screwed up by the staff and then replaced with something inedible, I had to request that it be removed. Any good restaurant owner and/or manager knows that you comp part of the meal if it is incorrect.   Lastly, the female owner decided that it would be smart to talk to my mother and I in the restroom about our disgusting excuse for brunch, but instead of being concerned and asking what happened, immediately, she had the gaul to suggest that, \"This restaurant is not a fit for you and you should not come back.\"  Frankly, after what happened today, I NEVER want to come back to MB.   MB needs a refresher in management and the first lesson: the CUSTOMER IS ALWAYS RIGHT!!  We had an awful brunch today and the owner could have cared less.  Instead, she tried to make up some story about how we were loud and people complained.  No one was loud, at least not until she bombarded us in the bathroom.   It has to be said that when other tables around us were upset about their food and service too (see Lauren G.'s review), I believe the people complaining about us were the wait staff and manager because they did not like being called-out on the horrible service and crappy food, specifically the use of frozen potatoes being passed off as \"breakfast potatoes.\" For a place pretending to be upscale and high-quality, everything today was appalling.",

The wines are not that inexpensive:  $8 for Chateau Monfort Vouvray Chenin Blanc & Marlborough Sauvignon Blanc to go along with the $9 happy hour specials of cheese plate, lobster monte cristo & a few other items.  On Fri they have jazz from 5-7 but the happy hr is 5-8 on M-F.  So it's a tasty bite & drink which was fun on a Fri nite so you can still go out esp if you need to get in early for Sat.",

    "text": "This review will be in divided into two sections. Food and Service.  Food: 4.2 Stars. My boyfriend and I ordered the Escargot Persillade, Lyonnaisse Salad, Crispy Maple Leaf Duck Breast, and Pappardelle \"Bolognese\". All were excellent. I highly recommend the duck. I did not know duck could have such a depth of flavor.    Also ordered creme brulee and \"coffee and doughnuts\". They were surprisingly mediocre compared to the outstanding quality of the rest of our dishes.   Service: 1.3 Stars. My boyfriend and I were looking for a nice place to spend our anniversary. I looked up some places and after finding mixed reviews on Yelp decided to take the plunge and try this place out. I made reservations earlier in the week. No problems there. When we arrived the host appeared lost trying to find us a table. We were seated in a section next to a large party. It seemed that the server was either distracted or overworked the entire time. He seemed very rushed and forgot or ignored several things. Some notable missteps included water glasses mostly empty the entire time, silverware not replaced before food was served, and he forgot the sides ordered along with the entrees.   This was particularly laughable. Our entrees were served. I assumed he was coming back with the sides. He checked in on us 5 minutes later.  I reminded him of the sides. The rapini arrived 5 minutes later (after we had both finished our entrees) and the truffle mac and cheese arrived 5 minutes after that. Kind of a joke when you are spending 30+ a plate.   I went there for the food. It was great. Do not go for the experience. You will be sorely disappointed. It seems they decided to hire the wait staff from an Applebees.",

    "text": "Downgrading from three stars to one, due to a disastrous experience on Easter. We called a WEEK in advance to ask about vegetarian options, and were told that they could accommodate with no problem, even though it was a set menu. Turns out the \"accommadation\" was nothing but an appetizer from the non vegetarian version of the menu with the meat taken out. Still charged the same price though!  When we emailed to complain, they sent us back a truly patronizing email.  \"We had several vegetarians that dined with us on Easter and were very pleased with the options.\" So you know, clearly its MY fault that I didn't enjoy whatever half assed entree they chose to throw down in front of me.  If it was my kitchen, I would have been ashamed to send that dish out to a paying customer.  Every restaurant has an off day... to me its how they deal with it that decides if they are a place worth returning to. For example, we visited Nittaya's Secret Kitchen last night and had some.. problems with the service. There was a mixup in the kitchen that resulted in our entrees being served roughly ten minutes apart. Not a great impression. What was great was that they apologized, took full responsibility, and asked what they could do to make it better. They did not say to us \"Well the other customers got their entrees ten minutes apart and they were fine with it.\" We have every intention of going back to Nittaya's. Marche Bacchus? Well lets just say I wish this had happened last year so I could have had my rehearsal dinner elsewhere.",

Then, when I asked our waiter about it and told him that I did not see that on the site when I booked he rudely told me it is definitely on the site.  I looked immediately and it was not on the main page of site or the menu pages or anything.  It was on one \"special events\" tab.  Who the heck drills through a whole site to get information that should have been noted clearly ESPECIALLY if you booked through the site????   Anyways, me and the girl were really looking forward to French onion soup and other entrees that we no longer had the option to order.   So after the BS menu as our only option and the rude waiter response, we move on to how extremely small the portions were and how we didn't have utensils for our dessert when served.    So after paying $335 for tiny dinner and a nice bottle of wine, I ended up stopping at del taco where the customer service was excellent, full menu offered and food quite filling.  Oh, and for $5.95.",

My husband and I both ordered the lobster salad but they ran out as it was later in the day so we switched our order and enjoyed it just the same.  We shared a cream brulee for dessert with coffee.

Everything I've eaten here has been amazing from their brunch to their cheese platters and dinner!   The worst thing about this place is the customer service! The waiters are great, but the hostesses are so rude and disrespectful! Which is shocking because aren't you supposed to have extremely nice and welcoming people to greet and seat you?  Well they don't! They make you wait 20 minutes after your reservation time and make you seem like they're doing you a favor by seating you! This definitely needs to change!  So 3 stars because of the crappy customer service, if they could hire some better people up front then I would definitely give this place 5 stars!",

However, ever since my first visit here about 7 years ago, this place became my favorite local French restaurant. The place has a great view that is definitely hard to get in Vegas, also the atmosphere is just different to a lot that is out in the strip. I always prefer outside seating, since the indoor just seems like a bistro.   Definitely consider getting a bottle of wine there and opening it. A lot of them are definitely hard to be found in liquor stores, so you will not be disappointed to look over the selections.   As far as for their food, I love their duck breast and their foie gras. Their pasta is really yummy too. I personally do not like my steaks to be cooked fully, however, their filet mignon tasted amazing when my dad ordered it well-done. He actually described it as one of the best steaks he had in his life.   The service is always great,the staff are friendly. I did have one incident where the server completely ignored us during the whole entire meal, but I did not really care too much since they usually take a good care of us. As long as I do not get the same server again, I will be another happy customer back again in this spot.",

The service can be a hit or miss but if you have a civilized talk with the manager in the plaid jacket, he will make amends.  Our first visit meal was wonderful. Artichoke ravioli in a light cream sauce that was so good it might temp you to lick your plate...luckily I'm in a relationship stage where I wouldn't judge her ;P My order of melt-in-your-mouth veal tenderloin was transcendent. I wish they kept it on a regular menu.  Last night's dinner started off with a Crab & Ricotta \"Beignet\" possibly with andouille sausage...anyway, the description sounded delicious. What we got was a large plate topped with one crab Empanada atop tomato sauce & some kind of minced vege...$18...NOT a \"Beignet\"! MB, ever hear of a place called New Orleans? We thought the rest of our meal was doomed and regret started to loom. But MB pulled it out of the 8th and delivered delicious entrees. Lobster Pappardelle with lobster poached in butter and served with a lobster cream sauce. The portions of succulent lobster was more than I expected :) the lobster cream sauce was good but needed a good shower of Parmesan to finish. Pumpkin ricotta gnocchi...light, fluffy and probably made by angels. The cream sauce was another home run.  Service was good last night that it made up for missing the complimentary anniversary dessert we would have gotten at our other favorite restaurant. It's ok (sniff sniff) we forgive you ;)  We won't be marching Bacchus too soon (insert groan) but may return if I can find that old fly swatter.",

    "text": "C'est magnifique!   I was really blown away by the food at Marche Bacchus!  I'm mad at myself that it took me so long to go and try this place out.  So many missed meals are running through my head right now.  Here were the highlights:  1. The food was amazing and easily 5 stars!  We tried a lot of things and everything we ordered was super tasty and tummy pleasing!    The meal started for both us us with French Onion Soup.  We each got our own because my hubby knows I don't share French Onion Soup with anyone!  The soup was fantastic! It is easily in my top 5 of all time.  This is saying a lot because I have been to France and ate a lot of French Onion soup while visiting.  My hubby had the wine braised beef and it was really very good.  A knife wasn't even needed to cut the meat because it would just fall apart on it's own.  It was packed with flavor and really was yum-tastic.    I went with the classic Steak Frites, because it is really one of my go to entrees.  My steak was cooked perfectly and was served with a delicious herb butter that was melting all over it.  The frites or french fries were some of the best I have ever eaten in my life, and i know a thing or two about french fries! To top it off, it came with the most fabulous Bearnaise I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  If it wasn't such a nice spot, I might have licked the ramakin clean because it was that yummy!   My hubby got Tiramisu for dessert.  I'm not a Tiramisu fan, so I can't say much about it, however the hubs said it was delightful!  2. The atmosphere is beautiful.  The restaurant is set right on one of the lakes in Desert Shores.  You can't beat waterfront dining, especially in the middle of the desert.  I almost forgot that we were in Las Vegas, which makes for a great evening out.  Great great great location!  3. The staff was all very friendly.  Everyone we encountered was smiling, happy, friendly, and helpful.  Yay for happy people!  So with all of this good stuff, why did I give it 4 stars instead of 5?  There were a couple of snafus that made them lose a star.  Here they are:  1. We made reservations ahead of time.  I had mentioned it was our anniversary and we would like nice table.  When we got there, the hostess made a big deal of only having one table left and having to squeeze us in.  The table we got was up against the wall.  The floor around us had some broken glass as well.  It seems to have been missed during a clean up effort, but we could easily see it.  There was also several tables wide open for the entire time we were there right next to the water.  I guess we weren't special enough for those seats.  2. The servers were all super nice, but stretched thin.  When we had our server, she was awesome.  The problem was we had to wait long periods in-between visits because she was so busy.  I don't mind a leisurely dinner, but this was a bit extreme.  Luckily we had made over night babysitting arrangements, otherwise we would have had to leave well before we were done with dinner.  So the food is awesome, the locale is beautiful, and it is a great place for a nice night out, just make sure you booked your babysitter for an extra hour or 2.",

    "text": "Located within the Desert Shores community, this place is not easily found. But it's their location that make this restaurant a very good place. I have been here 3-4 times within the last year and appreciate the scenery more than anything. Of the times I've dined here, I have had excellent service to mediocre at best. In addition, their food is better than average and is slightly above average but not too pricey. What really keeps me wanting to come back is the ambience. It is quaint cozy and overlooking water at Desert Shores. It is a great place to make you forget that you are in a desert and makes you feel like you are at a quaint cottage in France.",

    "text": "I'll start with the good. Awesome wine selection and wine shop. And the food was pretty good. However, the restaurant portion of the business definitely seems to be an afterthought.  It's really too bad, because this could be a hidden gem. Great atmosphere, cozy and quaint. Now, the flipside of the coin. The service is absolutely horrible. We had reservations and after being spoken to by 4 different people, we were finally taken to our table. The woman at the front desk was on a call and really should have taken the call elsewhere as she was obnoxiously loud. After being seated, we sat for over 20 minutes with no service. No water. No nothing. We sat next to a large floor fan and it was filthy. It really should have been moved out of the dining area or should have been cleaned. Finally our waiter showed up. I asked for water, he took our lunch order, and we also ordered wine. He came back twice to verify our wine order. At this point, we only had water. Then our food shows up. Still no wine. We asked for pepper for our salad. More than 5 minutes later, he shows up with salt and pepper. No wine yet.  A couple minutes later, our wine arrives. We noticed many of the other tables had bread, but we were never offered bread. So not sure if that was an oversight or if those tables ordered that.  In the time we were sitting there, we watched a number of frustrated customers - either waiting for service or waiting for their check. Anyway, I really want to like this place but the service was painful. Other than the 1 large table, one good wait person could have handled that entire patio. Hope you can get the service piece of the puzzle fixed.",

I ordered the Red Wine Braised Beef with White Truffle Grits.  Sound good right?  No.  The beef itself was just ok.  Very tender, but it was missing flavor.  The grits were super grainy and had ZERO flavor and did not reflect white truffle at all...AT ALL.  I've had grits before and when done correctly is very creamy and should not be grainy.    Overall, I wasn't impressed. It's good for a nice dinner and you don't want to leave your neighborhood, but I live in Henderson and I would never drive out that way just for Marche Bacchus.  Sorry.",

Probably,one of the more romantic night spots on the west side.  They also have a fantastic lunch menu, with a lobster salad croissant that is True bliss..... mmmmmm....

Asked for lemon on the side for my water; that took almost 15 minutes with a second request from me half way thru; response, \" someone had to cut the lemon\"!! Our waiter did not know the meaning of the word \"timing\". Nothing was brought in a timely manner and confusion on his part was the word of the day!! When entrees finally arrived, my son's order was wrong, not what he ordered. When the correct entree was delivered the eggs were so undercooked and runny it was hard to even look at the plate! I watched the Manager pour champagne into my daughter's glass, get champagne all over as he did not know how to properly pour(this is the same Manager that told his staff not to serve bread to their guests as it was only Brunch!) Our bus person found that absolutely absurd as we did and gladly brought us bread while we waited. Timing was an issue all around us and other guests could be overheard grumbling about the lack of service and inferior food  guality. When confronted with these and other issues, Rhonda the owner and her so-called Manager just hide, do nothing to rectify issues and in fact, go as far as telling guests  \" maybe this restaurant is not for you and you should not return\"!! UNBELIEVEABLE!!!!! We have been to many, many restaurants in many parts of the globe over several decades; some are better than others and some are worse than others but none have ever had such egotistical snobs as owners or managers or whatever they want to call themselves! They can rest assured that we will never return (this was the second fiasco in as many weeks as we attended a pre-planned celebration with a large party that was also an absolute service and food disgrace! Try a Caesar salad that was absolutely limp and warm and $10!!) nor will the myriad of people we know.  DO YOURSELF A BIG FAVOR AND FIND SOMEWHERE ELSE TO DINE. THE ONLY THING THIS PLACE HAS IS A DECENT ATMOSPHERE ON THE LAKE BUT YOU CAN'T EAT THAT!!",

SERVICE: It took an hour for the food to arrive;  we'd ordered easy appetizers, a burger and a baked chicken dish.  Trop Tarde!  STAFF: We've found them to be engaging, but distracted.  The restaurant doesn't deign to put out salt and pepper shakers; I asked two waiters in succession to get those for me.  Nothing happened after about 10 minutes, so I got up and went for them myself;  lots of confusion and hand-waving to get them, only to find they were not functional.  Merde!  AMBIENCE:  Nice;  the lake, the swans, plausible pseudo-French accents, a neat guy handling the music.  C'est bon!  FOOD:  The broiled shrimp, cheese grits & remoulade appetizer was execrable.  I'm from New Orleans;  we board up and condemn restaurants that massacre simple dishes like that.  My wife liked the burger, but it didn't like her;  it entertained her for 24 hours ;-(  My broiled chicken was meh exemplified.  Any Albertson's rotisserie can beat it;  ecrasez l'infame!  PRICE PERFORMANCE:  All this mediocrity for a tipped bill of ~$83? Scandale!  OVERALL:  Alright, kindergarten's over.  No more Marche for me. C'est Fini!",

Entering through their wine shop, we grabbed our red blend bottle and headed to the table on the patio (most of the seating is outside). The patio overlooks all that is Vegas and Summerlin: a fake lake with McMansions on the opposite shore. Nevertheless, most of us enjoy being close to bodies of water (however man-made), and I am no exception. The multilevel patio was constructed with care and dollars, and it makes for a great dining environment. We started our meal off with a cheese plate that offered five cheeses that covered a nice spectrum of fromage. From there, we went straight to the entrees. I had the roasted chicken. While I largely ordered the dish to have a lower-calorie option (which I am sure was still packed with cals), the dish turned out to be amazing - possibly the best chicken dish I have ever had. I also tasted both of my friends' dishes (steak frites and halibut), both of which were the cat's pajamas as well. The only dig I could offer is that the staff was not entirely personable. The host acted like it was a bit of a chore to seat us, and our server half-assed it. However, the manager did make his rounds and checked on us, which I always appreciate.",

All I can say that on 9/10 they were spot on, and this was another in a long string of great visits we have had. Got a fantastic Pinot on sale in the shop, caesar salad was just right, shrimp and grits was great, and the short ribs with blue cheese mash was just terrific. Worthy of Foodies for sure. Service was from a French guy with a sense of humor, attentive and funny.  The view of the water I think is really terrific. Ok, there are some building around it, but in a city where all you see if either brown mountains or man-made super buildings, I find it refreshing just to see some water while dining, and I'll take it even if it isn't a naturally occurring lake.   While you can find food that is as good or slightly better for similar prices in the casinos, I give Marche the edge based on the fact it is within the suburbs, no messing with valet parking, no walking through a smoky casino, and getting a take home bottle of wine from  off-the-beat-and-path wineries for a reasonable price.  Keep up the great work guys, we will continue to come back!",

And then everything went downhill.  They expanded and they changed the menu and they got new owners.  The amazing location and the fundamental charm didn't change, but the food got a bit lackluster and service went out the window.    I don't know how long it takes to seat a party, even if that party has a reservation and your hostess appears to be standing about.  I could probably guess.  I don't know how long it takes to get that party (now seated) menus.  I could probably guess.  I don't know why a pretty standard dinner could take three hours.  I'm sure you could guess.  I don't want to comment on whether or not my chicken was undercooked or if I was just drunk.  And I still don't understand why, despite being a French restaurant, they don't have truly outstanding bread.  Even Mon Ami Gabi (a CHAIN!) does that right.  I have to give three stars, because I'm torn between how I feel (two stars!  two stars!!!) and how I want to feel (five stars!  five stars!!).  They need to whip their staff into shape (service has been an issue on multiple occasions, if you are wondering).  They need to get the fundamentals down.  They can keep their wine just as is (perfect!).  And they need to think about what sets them apart.",

The ambience is lovely;  They have a great wine store leading into the restaurant too.  Our waiter, Vincent, was so nice and accomodating. You should ask for him if you go. We had the truffled mac and cheese, and then their special, halibut with a lemon butter sauce with broccolini,  and for dessert the bread pudding.  Everything was cooked just right and the flavors were not salty or over sauced as is the case in so many restaurants.  The truffled mac and cheese is a must !!!  The absolute best.  You can see the chunks of black truffles throughout the mac. Cannot wait to go again. Kudos to the chef.",

    "text": "I find the food here completely overrated.  I have been here several times. The Napa cabbage salad was boring and bland. A bunch of shredded cabbage tossed in dressing topped with dry, flavorless chicken. Honestly, I have had a better salad from Chili's (and without the ducks begging for bread).   Second time was for dinner.  I had the Seafood Paella. Now, I am by no means a food snob.  I sneak the occasional Del Taco.  But the seafood was extremely overcooked, the rice was dry and sticky and the seasoning left much to be desired.   The wine shop is great and I usually like sitting outside by the lake.  For the price, I would go elsewhere.",

    "text": "This place has great atmosphere, great wines, good service, and manageable food.   We happened upon it one afternoon and, to our delight, it was retail wine day.  That meant we could pick any wine from the attached wine store and enjoy it at our table for the retail price.  Granted these prices weren't exactly Lee's prices, but they were pretty darn god for a restaurant.   We sat on the patio on a beautiful July day and it was just the right temp by the lake.  The service was attentive.  This place would be five stars if it had good food.  Bistro food is pretty standard fair, but somehow they manage to make it underwhelming.  There's just no thoughtfulness to any of the presentations or condiments.  The food was not bad, it just isn't consistent with the rest of the experience. Either way, you can't go wrong for an afternoon or early evening dinner at this place.",

I eat out a lot and I study restaurants. It's a tough business with thin margins, I get that. But a restaurant in trouble can do (1) cost-cutting moves like switching from a free valet to a paid valet service or (2) rip off their customers with things like charging for refills on soda. I'll never return to this restaurant again.",

    "text": "This is one of my favorite restaurants in Summerlin. I first went here about 3 years ago for restaurant week right after I moved to Las Vegas and it has been a staple ever since.  First, the atmosphere/ambiance at this restaurant is totally different from most other places in the area. Summerlin is a planned community and as such it follows the same pattern as every other suburb on the planet- every 6 blocks there is a strip mall with a Best Buy and a Chilis. Most restaurants are chains and look exactly the same as every other restaurant in the country. Not so Marche Bacchus- it is an incredible place with an awesome view of the lake. It is an excellent place to take your special lady friend or anyone else you want to impress with your faux sophistication (second best place- Buffalo Wild Wings).   Second, I have always found the service to be exceptional. The staff strike the perfect middle ground between ignoring you and being overly needy/explaining a million things you didn't ask about.   Notes on specific dishes  French Onion Soup- not exactly rocket science to prepare, but that doesn't stop the Outbacks of the world from ruining a classic. This is great- very rich and no unnecessary flavors  Steak tartare- something you can pretty much get anywhere now a days but few are as good  Creamy Polenta- I love polenta so this is something I get frequently. The mushrooms make it less of a one note side dish and more of an appetizer.   Veal- my absolute favorite. It always comes so tender and perfectly seasoned.  Beef Tenderloin- the red wine sauce on this is amazing. I'm not usually a beef tenderloin person but I love this.",

    "text": "This was my first visit to Marche Bacchus.  I was a little confused by how the wine works when we arrived in the wine store and checked in for our reservation.  The waiter explained it to me, but my wife and I stuck to ordering glasses as we wanted some champagne before dinner and we were both having different types of meat.  (You can shop the wine store and they will bring the bottle to your table; it's like cafe's in Europe and a process not often done in the US.  I think it is neat and will arrive earlier next time to choose the wine).  I started with the heirloom tomato salad and she had the scallops.  Both were delicious.  The bread was warm and tasty.  I had the halibut and she had beef tenderloin.  We ended the meal with cappuccinos and beignets.    We were sat at an outdoor table between two covered patios and near a water fall water fountain.  It was a nice table, but the fountain made it a little noisy.  I think the fountain would also look nicer if lights were added in or around it.  My only complaint was that my water could have been filled more often, but for a busy night I was pleased with the service.  We dined on 5/31/2013 at 7 pm and our waiter was Stephen.  He was very nice.  My wife and I bought a bottle of the pinot noir she had with dinner; they sell the wines by glass by the bottle too and you can drink them there or take them home.  The wines by glass list is one of the largest and diverse I have seen; it took us 20 minutes to decide the wine and we were fine with that as it sparked conversations about the drink we love.  They also had live music.  The singer was great and not too loud.   It took us about 1.5 hours to dine which was not a problem since dining on a lake in Las Vegas is nice; we will definitely be going back.",

The atmosphere on the patio is wonderfully relaxing.  This place is Vegas Strip fine dining without the hassle of the Vegas Strip! The food was fantastic and the service was perfect. We were there to dine on a Monday and they don't charge a corking fee for the wine...The beef carpaccio was tender and very flavorful. The roast duck breast was fantastic and the grilled salmon was prepared to perfection (rare with crispy skin, as I asked for it). The Brussels Sprouts were amazing...and I hate Brussels Sprouts. My wife ordered them, but I ate most of them! The \"Coffee & Donuts\" dessert was awesome...perfectly prepared beignets came with espresso dipping sauce...yum!!

    "text": "I have been patronizing MB since it was a small but well stocked wine store owned by a lovely French couple who added a lunch counter, the impetus of the beautiful lakefront dining Mecca of today.   Through the years, the couple retired and Jeff lovingly took the helm. The addition of the huge patio complete with misters, waterfall and fireplace only improved on ambience. Saturday free wine tastings, Jazz music, and the brilliant \"choose your bottle & pay minimum corkage\"  (waived Mondays) is a deal in a town that marks up wine shamelessly. Get on the email list for a heads up on special dinners/pairings, etc.   Chef Stratta had those resistant to change up in arms, but the rotating menu & lunch specials are favorite \"forget you are in Vegas\" steals, with daily specials a bonus. It can get crowded as this is a power lunch spot.   I'm a big fan of fish, simply prepared and they are always willing to adjust to requests. Mom loved a perfectly prepared roast chicken with frites and Dad is a steak man. All appetites are sated with flair. Another nice option is to choose a bottle of wine and catch up over a delightful charcuterie, beet salad or other small plates.   The lake is lovely and the ducks charming, sometimes stealing sugar packets and napkins  Staff can be hit or miss, especially when busy but are usually hit.   Sunday brunch is always a good call. Many friends have thanked me for introducing them to this very special spot & it has earned the nickname \"your French place\"   Hope it remains so for many more years to come as small, exceptional off Strip dining is rare and should be supported, IMHO.",

The dining room area is nicely maintained with enough space between tables to be intimate without being too intimate.  We sat outside and the view of the lake is great.  The patio area is covered in a fancy banquet style tent material that is functional but not tacky or cheap looking.  The only potentially confusing thing about this place is that the front is a wine store, with a wine tasting bar and doesn't automatically register as a hostess stand where one would go to seek seating.  The service was excellent.  We had read from previous reviews about an infamous Tracy, but both spoke with her on the telephone prior to coming and were promptly seated by her.  Our server was excellent and attentive.  I had the Eggs Bennedict with blue crab.  It was appropriately apportioned, tasty and served with option for caesar salad.  My wife had the lobster croissant.  The lobster croissant was an excellent blend of lobster meat in a light sauce with tomato and avocado.  The frites were thin, delicious and made a good accompaniment to the lobster croissant.  I would recommend dining here.  Personally, I'm looking to trying a cheese plate and some of the wines.",

    "text": "I have been a patron of Marche' Bacchus for many, many years. I raved to my dear friend about the wonderful food, service and ambiance the restaurant had to offer and chose it especially for her birthday luncheon celebration. Geesh, was I let down and embarrassed.  We started with a five minute wait at the door while the hostess leisurely rang someone up. She finally finished, acknowledged us and seated us outside in a corner, even though there were plenty of lakeside tables available. Not to start out on the wrong foot, we accepted the lackluster table and gazed through the cloudy, plastic, weather-tarp in front of us. I watched the Manager tip a heat lamp around for a while in an attempt to fix or light it.  After ten minutes of being completely unacknowledged, the waiter finally came over and gave us water. Sunny Sunday brunch-server personality? Nope. Seemed tired and unmotivated to be there. I have seriously received better service at Macaroni Grill. Isn't part of the dinning experience and higher prices great service? Not this day.  We ordered a cheese platter and waited 20 minutes for it to arrive. Luckily the busboy brought bread and butter and we snacked on that instead. It was fresh and very good. The cheeses were tasty, but the sampling was super-skimpy for the price. Since it took another 30 minutes to get our entrees (which were only salads), we ate the bread and asked TWICE for more (or a cracker) so we could pare it with the cheeses. Unfortunately, neither arrived.  The most annoying part of the meal was the mimosas order. We each ordered one and received them promptly. We finished them before our cheese chunks were gobbled down, so we decided to order another to help us cope with the humor of being ignored. The server filled our half-empty glasses and took off. We assumed the OJ would be coming right behind him, but nope. Straight champagne for us. When I got the bill, I was horrified to see that the Sunday Brunch mimosas were endless. We each only got a glass and a half and were charged $40! I'm pretty upset about that.  MB used to be so delicious and set a certain standard for locals who know where to go to find the \"good\" restaurants. New owner? New manager? Not sure what happened, but I seriously felt robbed when I left the restaurant. I would have talked to the manager, but I was so frustrated by the time we left, I decided it would just be better to bite the bullet. So disappointed!!!!!",

    "text": "What a surprise.  Walking up from the outside, I was a little disappointed about the place - thought it would be \"outdoors\", when it's in the center of a non-descript strip mall.  But once through the automatic front doors, you're transported into a cozy wine celler at first, then through to the comfy restaurant/outdoor seating area.  Totally not what I had expected from the looks of the exterior.    From moderately priced champagnes to ultra high end bordeaux, they have a large variety of great wines.  You can even purchase a bottle and open it on the spot for a $10 corkage fee.    Had heard the food was good, which is why we came - and I was not disappointed.  Since it was sunday, it was mostly brunch items, but pretty much everything we tried was very tasty.  A few dishes of note:  -Buckwheat crepes: savory crepes are usually salty due to the sauce that's poured on.  Not the case here.  Crepe was soft and tender, with the chicken and mushroom going together nicely, and a light thyme creme sauce to tie it all together.    -Croque madame: frenchy countryside comfort food.  Love me a good thick piece of bread, and boy, their pain di mie was amazing.  Thick cuts of ham and two gooey over-easy eggs to tie it all together.  Yum.  -Lobster salad croissant: There's something really good about home made pastries and bread.  No corner cutting here.  Fresh lobster meat, mixed with creamy avocado, piled on top of a fresh baked croissant.    The kids really dug the lake view and hung around quietly watching the turtles swim around, while the adults ate and socialized.  Overall a great experience.  Highly recommended if you can stomach the drive into the heart of sSummerlin.",

My friend and I walked in here for the free wine tasting, sadly they were out of 1 of the reds, but hey- its free, I'm not complaining! I liked a couple and then I was in the mood for some wine, the selection was large so I had plenty to choose from.  I looked around for 15 minutes and decided on a Chardonnay as it was pretty warm outside and I wanted to sit by the lake. (oh yah, did I mention that view?! Ahhh! Killer!)  Anywho, sat outside and told the waiter I was interested in  wine, he told me I could just go in pick what I wanted and bring it out, say what?! AWESOME!   I had the Lobster salad in croissant, and if you like Lobster salad, you will love this!  My friend had the BLT and he said it was the best BLT he ever had (one in Louisiana came pretty close) the bacon on this BLT was mad thick, now I'm craving one!   Hands down this place is awesome, and deserves a chance if you're nearby.  Keep in mind this isn't some cheapo restaurant either, it's a little higher end.  Two person lunch + apptz is going to run you about $40-$50 bucks.  So worth it though :D",

    "text": "Came here last night with our wonderful friends Jesse and Don for a couples night out. I decided to try this place based on location, atmosphere, food and reviews about the service from the Yelpers.  It did not disappoint.   When you enter the restaurant, you come into the \"wine shop\" where you first select your wine/beer of choice.  From the moment we walked in we were helped with wine selection. I heard about the Poison Red Zin and chose it for dinner.  It was very light and satisfying. I also chose a Prosecco and the guys chose the \"Rolls Royce of Beers\" (as the waiter called it) think its spelled \"Chimay\".    We chose to sit out on the patio but it was covered with the plastic so that was a bummer. We did have a space heater and the waiter was courteous to adjust the heat accordingly.    They sat us in a corner and my view was of a door and some candles-which was the only reason I didn't give this a 5-star rating-because when I called for the reservation I asked for a \"really good table\".  If this is the hostess' definition of a good table...then she needs to be re-trained.   The tables in front of the fireplace would have fit the bill. Inside was really nice too, but it felt more casual outside and less stuffy-so we were fine with that.   Live music-female singer-wonderful really provided some nice ambiance. She sang Adele, Nora Jones, etc.  So 5-star for the entertainment.  Food was very good, I can't say I was full-since I didn't order side dishes but we ordered mussels and the shrimp with grits (creole) and very tasty.  Keep in mind this is a French restaurant so portions were small and you have to order Al a Carte for veggies/ mashed potatoes, etc.   I ordered the duck-very good, my husband had the shrimp which he said was fabulous, the trout was also served as well as the lobster ravioli-everyone raved about their dishes.  They also bring out a little bread and butter basket and the baguettes were marvelous. You need to order side dishes to feel satisfied.  I think what impressed all of us the most was the service!  That is definitely a five star rating!!!  Waiters were friendly, accommodating, gracious, polite, professional, I could go on and on. We were pretty loud-laughing the whole night and we felt like we had the whole restaurant to ourselves-it was a fabulous fun night.    We had reservations at 5:45 and stayed until 10 pm so you never felt rushed to leave.  This place was pricey and the portions are just too small to justify the price. Maybe I'll try lunch next time.",

    "text": "I've been back to Bacchus several times since I wrote my review, and I think I'm growing fond of the place.  Last time, I wrote that every time I went, the food was worse and the price was higher. That is no longer True. The prices have stabilized, and I don't know what they're doing differently in the kitchen, but the food quality is way way up from where it used to be.   They still serve ciabatta instead of baguette, which I still don't enjoy, but I've gotten over it. They have a number of really good plates that I actually look forward to. The Heirloom Beet Salad is just out of this world, as is the Lyonnaise (dinner only, unfortunately).   They finally learned how to cook a burger (hooray!) so my medium rare actually comes out medium rare.  I've now been for dinner a few times, and I think I enjoy their dinner selections more than I do their lunches. That may be because I've had their lunch menu several times over and it's getting a little stale (though to their credit they do try to change it up fairly often). But the king salmon entree is wonderful, with a lovely crust and perfectly cooked fish -- not too firm, not too dry, but also not sopping raw. Perfect. My mouth just watered a little, actually.  I love foie gras, but I'm not a fan of their foie. I find the preparation too sweet. Foie is already incredibly rich, so I tend to favor preparations that don't add much. Just sear it and put it on some good bread with a dab of dark fruit jam and I'll be happy. MB serves their foie on a \"vanilla bread pudding\" with \"winter spiced pineapple balsamic.\" It's sweet. Overly so. Then again, I had foie at Andre's and it was sweet there, as well, so I think this is just one of those things where nobody agrees with me.  Anyway, I retract my earlier harshness about Marche Bacchus. You should go. You will like it.",

The service was decent but nothing over the top - it took a few minutes to get seated and others were seated before us after we had been waiting for 5 minutes. Maybe they had a reservation but it seemed they forgot about us b/c we had to remind them we were still waiting.   The menu offers lots of fabulous choices and several vegetarian options. I opted for a veggie version of the Muffuletta over the Asparagus & Mushroom Panini on the suggestion of our waiter. It was good but I don't know if I would order it again. The side salad was very tasty though and I greatly enjoyed it. My husband had the crab louie and he loved it. My husband and his friend also split the escargot and were very pleased with that dish.   But let's talk about the seared sea scallops. For $16, you only receive 2 small scallops! What is that about???? The look on our friend's face was priceless. She almost said, \"I thought I ordered the entree version\" But that was the entree version!!! Do not bother with the scallops, though she said they were tasty, if that was your only dish - you would end up ordering something else.",

I mostly visit once a year, and the visit is made on Valentine's because of their special menus. This past  Valentine's Day, we enjoyed the warm duck confit salad and some kind of octopus appetizer (I've never seen thinly sliced octopus legs put together like a sheet of paper...AMAZING!).",

My wife ordered the carrot soup and Cesars salad. She enjoyed both. I had a taste of her shrimp salad which was delicious. I ordered the classic seafood bouilabaisse. I was very disappointed as the server brought it to our table I noticed it had pasta which a classic seafood bouilabaisse does not contain pasta.  Also only had 3 shrimps 3 mussels, 3 clams it had very minimal seafood for  $24. and had no octopus as described on the menu. So as the polite waiter named Bradley checked on us. I told him It was served with pasta and didn't not have any octopus as the menu stated.  So he went to ask the cook and shortly returned to tell us they ran out of octopus last night. I just wish I would have known that prior to ordering as we gave up pasta for lent. I would have ordered the Cesars salad instead. In the future I feel you should let your customers know if your missing items to complete the dish to inform your paying customers.",

We were pleasantly surprised by the restaurant's view of the lake, the wine shop and the evening's entertainment.  However our waiter was frequently MIA and as a result the amount of time we waited was unacceptable.  It took almost 30 minutes to get our salads/soups.  After another 30 minutes went by we flagged down our waiter to find out where our entrees were.  When the entrees did come out we only got 4 out of 5.  It took another 10 minutes for the 5th entree to be brought out.  My entree was cold.  And my sisters entree (the risotto) was under cooked.  The waiter blamed the situation on new staff in the kitchen, but even if that was True he should have been paying attention to what was going on.  The restaurant was busy, but they weren't slammed.  I requested to speak to the manager.  He was apologetic, comp'd my meal and brought a sampling of desserts for the table to share.  I'm hoping this was just an \"off night\" but won't know for sure unless I give the restaurant another try.",

We were the only table inside due to the outside seating being open but we had nice service and very good food. The only negative was the portion sizes were all over the place with some appetizers being the same size as the entrees.  I think they could bolster a few dishes even with the use of greens or more of the starch and the value perception would increase dramatically. When considering the price and portion size this restaurant really ends up being about the same as many of the higher end restaurants on the strip. I don't have a problem with this but feel they may be hurting themselves by becoming more of a special occassion restaurant vs. a weekly haunt for some. We also met the owner and she was a lovely person and we look forward to getting to know her in the future.  THUMBS UP!",

The waiter was terrible (and yes it was Joey). He should consider a different career path.  The food, once we finally got it, was definitely mediocre and not worth returning for.  We were there for Sunday brunch, and I chose it because it was down the way from Garfield's which was actually worse this day (never got waited on there...separate review).  I won't go into too much detail, but my advice is to not ask Joey for a vegetarian version of anything on the menu. He doesn't know what that means.  When I told him that I am vegetarian and would like the crab and asparagus eggs Benedict without the crab, he asked me if I'd rather have ham instead.  I repeated that I was vegetarian.  He then asked if I wanted the eggs.  I politely said yes, just no crab.  When they brought our meals, I had a nothing Benedict with bread and some asparagus. He offered to have the eggs and sauce added on top, and apologized for the misunderstanding.  It came back quickly, but the eggs were undercooked.  So I just ate around them.  Not going back.",

It was shredded and almost had the texture of \"Krab\".  Very unappealing, and a very poor rendition of a lobster sandwich.  The signature bread pudding was also sub-par, burnt on top and dry throughout.  Definitely not worth the pre-ordering and 20 minute wait.   Service is disappointing, however the wine store is lovely and has a nice selection at reasonable prices.  The view is great and they have misters (major bonus in summer time), but next time I will be trying Garfield's next door in hopes of a better meal.",

We had to ask our server for baguette crackers or something along that lines to go with the platter.  It is my understand that is something that always comes with that order but OK.  The fare is a bit heavy for me but it was still a nice place to try.  If you are drinking wine and want pleasant atmosphere this is a nice place for that.

This amazing french restaurant is a locals favorite.  It sits on the lake with inside and outside bistro seating.  The wine store in the front of the house is the most complete you will find in vegas. The food here is authentic french.  Omelettes like you will find in Paris (the french can cook an egg, so please folks, don't ruin this one by ordering it eggs white only!!!).  Amazing charcuterie as well as stand-bys like onion soup and hachis parmentier (sheperds pie).  Great spot for outdoor dining.",

However, the food was so good that it easily gets a 5.  Possibly the best meal that I have had in the state of Nevada.   We had: - Foie Gras - Escargot - Seared Scallops - Trio of Gelato - An amazing Cabernet Wine  All were delicious, and highly recommended.  I actually couldn't even rank these dishes in order, since they were just so good.  My co-worker had the duck breast, and he also said that it was phenomenal.  I can hardly wait to go back.",

    "text": "Solid 5 star lunch!  Lakefront Lunch ($19.95) is a two course meal (you choose app/entree or entree/dessert) which includes a glass of house red/white wine.  Speaking of the house wine, it is excellent!  I should have asked for the names!  The white is smooth and crisp, with just the right amount of bite.  The red is lovely...light and fragrant, with a hint of bitterness that works well with the Burger IMO.  Half Pound Burger : Horseradish Black Pepper Aioli, Cheddar Cheese, Pickled Red Onion & Arugula.  You did expect me to go with the burger did you not??  LOL.  Happy to say, it is an excellent choice.  Initial squeeze drops the fatty juices, lots of flavor in the meat and the Horseradish aioli, and the pickled onion and arugula add a nice crunch and flavor to the whole picture.  I also love the french fry consistency here!  Creme Brulee : Vanilla Bean Custard and Caramelized Sugar.  Good rendition!  Don't expect it to make waves, but it was a great way to end lunch :)  Trio Sorbet : Strawberry and Lemon. Good..one lump was a little extra icy...the others were perfect, tasty and light.  Service was very friendly, and the atmosphere is great on a beautiful day, sitting on the patio and overlooking the lake.  With the excellent lunch deal they have, it's one of the best places to eat in the neighborhood!  Pics :",

My husband enjoyed walking through the wines to select a bottle for dinner, which was reasonably priced.  We had the truffled goat cheese napoleon for an appetizer, and I'm surprised neither of us licked the plate clean!  I had the steak frites for dinner, which was cooked perfectly with a little chimichurri sauce on top.  The atmosphere was relaxing and the service was impeccable.  Vincent did a great job serving us and the manager stopped a handful of times to check in.  We'll definitely return on future visits to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Came across this place after searching on Yelp an available option while in this neighborhood.  I was travelling with my co-worker and we were seated outdoors in the back part of the restaurant affording a gorgeous lake-front view.  We were shaded under a canopy and cooled with some misters that make the experience more pleasant.  We were here during restaurant week and chose the prix fixe option.  I chose the fresh burrata cheese with heirloom tomatoes as my first course.  The presentation was exquisite and the tomatoes were absolutely delicious.  The whole dish came together well as the cheese was nice and creamy and the basalmic vinegar gave the right amount of acidity.  What a way to start off.    I chose the poulet frites, or roasted chicken breast as my next course.  The dish was accompanied with some fries that were tasty, albeit a bit overseasoned.  The chicken was a bit overcooked and dry, but the skin packed some nice flavor.  After the knockout for the first course, this was definitely a disappointment.  I closed with the creme brulee.  It was sweet and tasty and the portion was decently sized.  I should mention that my co-worker ordered the tiramisu option, but he was told as they were delivering the dish that they \"ran out\" and could only substitute the creme brulee or lemon tart.  It was disappointing that this was communicated near the end of the meal, especially considering that we arrived when the restaurant opened for lunch at 11:00 am.  The value was decent, costing about $30 per head before tax and tip.  Service was decent although they were slow in terms of refilling our water glasses despite the restaurant being nearly empty.  While the atmosphere was top notch, the food was uneven, but still enjoyable nonetheless.",

We sat there for a while deciding if we wanted to stay.

The lakeside seating is absolutely fabulous - there's really not many places like this in Vegas, especially for locals, to feel like they're away from the noise and crowds of the Strip, so if you're looking for a great date nite or romantic setting, this restaurant absolutely will not disappoint! The lakeside view with swans and ducks gliding past is marvelous.    The service was very good and attentive.  I and my lunch guest had the smoked chicken sandwich which was on a nice roll, with crispy lettuce and avocado.  The chicken could have had  a BIT more flavor, but overall was  an enjoyable sandwich.  It came with the most DIVINE french fries I've ever had, and I've had a lot of  fries in my life. These were crispy, lovely and totally addictive.  I could NOT stop eating those french fries!  Finished the meal with creme brulee for dessert ($9) which could have been a little larger for the price, but it was excellent, made with tahitian vanilla with a wonderful cracked sugar topping.   The only \"glitch\" is that the server said that the wait for our meal would be delayed by about 20 minutes because some sort of problem had developed with their ovens.  Luckly, I and my guest were in no hurry, but a delay could have caused a problem if we had another appointment somewhere.  So, I couldn't give this place four stars due to that.  Also, our table was a little \"wobbly\" which was irritating during the meal.  Would luv to give a lovely restaurant like this five stars, but couldn't do it  this time around.  Looking forward to trying more things on their menu and maybe next time will be the charm that brings it up to five star?",

It looked like a wine market at first, but then we stepped down to a warm, and cozy lower level overlooking the pond. Please believe me when I say the New Old Fashioned is a must have. We also drank something that had gin and Absinthe; whatever that was, you HAVE to try it! Onion soup, lobster Caesar, steak frites, and creme brulee.. this place has dining down to an art. We will be back :)",

    "text": "Let me say that I was really excited to try this place because I knew the atmosphere was going to be great, and it definitely was. I came here with my bf for my bday brunch.  He made a reservation for us for 12pm. We came right on time but ended up having to wait for about 10 minutes, which wasn't a big deal. It's a rare, beautiful day in Vegas so everyone wants to sit in the patio area.   We ordered the escargot to start which was good. My boo got the smoked salmon Benedict (which I wanted also but didn't want to get the same thing) and I ended up trying the crab and asparagus Benedict. The flavors were pretty bland to me and they all mashed together (and not in a good way). I love eggs Benedict but I was very underwhelmed. I tried some of my bf's which was slightly better but definitely not worth the money in my opinion. You're more so paying for the ambiance rather than food/service.   On top of that, the service was slow. My bf and I look really young and it seemed at though they kind of kept forgetting about us. It was decent for Sunday brunch time and they didn't seem understaffed to me. I was really annoyed when we had to wait 20 minutes for our check so we could leave. All in all, totally unimpressed and underwhelmed.",

    "text": "I have been coming to Marche' Bacchus for many years and have never been disappointed. From the moment you enter the quaint wine store/cafe you are in for a great experience.  They have a great location in Desert Shores right on the water. I enjoy stopping by for a good glass of wine and their cheese plate while sitting outside near the water in early June.  On this past Saturday evening, we did sit outside and the heat lamps were on so it was very comfortable. There was a guitar playing some good music which added to the ambiance. We were welcomed with a glass of champagne which was something new but we all really liked it and toasted happily. We were quickly greeted by our waiter who told us about the specials and then gave us ample time to make our decisions. I appreciate when a restaurant allows you to take your time and doesn't rush you to order. This allows one to enjoy the evening. We decided on the Swordfish, New York Steak with a large prawn, and the Pork Loin.  We also enjoyed the goat cheese/compote on a flaky croissant for appetizer.  I went in and picked the wine. We enjoyed a nice Tobin James Zinfandel. If you are a wine lover like me, this part is fun since you have a whole store of 900+ bottles to choose which kind of wine you want to drink!  The Swordfish was so buttery and tender. It simply melted in your mouth. The Pork Loin was also very tasty my friend told me as she has had it before and it is one of their best dishes. Out of all three dishes, the NY steak and prawn were just disappointing. Although the steak was tender and served in a Bernaise sauce it was just lacking and I probably made a mistake in ordering it. I will not discount the restaurant for this one dish as I have had several amazing dishes dining here so it would not be fair to grade them poorly for my mistake.  We ended our meal with some tasty desserts. The service was excellent and the temperature was comfortable on the patio. If you find yourself in the neighborhood be sure to stop in for brunch, lunch or dinner. This place is a main stay in this part of town!",

Anyway the price was good I took the lunch menu with a glass of wine who was very good.

Instead...... we got ...\"4?\". ( I presumed she meant table for 4. ) Yes.... we proceed to follow her through the wine shop to an outdoor patio that is quite lovely.  Even though it was extremely hot out.... it remained comfortable with musters and fans.  Our server Jan was wonderful. So we all forgot about our snooty hostess.  Food was delicious. We were there for lunch and all had something different.  French onion soup amazing. Tomato Bisque ...creamy  goodness.  Buckwheat crepes filled with mushrooms and chicken delightful. Lobster salad on a buttery croissant.. and a 4 hour braised beef sandwich with truffle fries.  Desserts ..... creme brulee .... vanilla pannacotta ... and bread pudding. Needless to say... out of this world.  If you need a break from the loud strip action.... head out here. Nice treat.  Just don't expect warm fuzzy feeling at the door. It won't happen.",

They would not honor happy hour prices because we were no longer in the bar. For the appetizers, We were then talked into ordering their specialty french onion soup for $10@. It was average at best. So was the escargot.  They had no glasses of wine for under $16 and trust me they had plenty of cheap wines in their wine store. After appetizers, wine and dessert, the waiter asked us if we could settle our checks and leave as there was a group waiting for a table. Are you kidding me? Never again for this clip joint!!",

    "text": "If you are a French cuisine fan, this is definitely one of those hidden gems that locals love to frequent. It's sort of like a strip mall setting but more quaint and special since it's located by the lake in a prestigious, quiet and well-maintained neighborhood. There are actually other restaurants in this location that's on my list. Seated by a huge bay window with the view of the lake watching ducks glide on the water and a solo guitar player singing popular classic and pop songs in the background. There are several dining area set ups in various levels with mist sprays keeping everyone cool while dining and there was a wide variety of interesting people to watch as well Oh about the food- for appetizers, the Escargot \"Persillade\" was amazing - just be careful, it's served hot. It was crowded that night, there was a slight wait on the entrees. I had the Pan Roasted Duck Breast (no it wasn't the one gliding on the lake - joking) - medium well and seasoned lightly with a side of Farro salad along with a signature cocktail. Oh did I mention it's also a wine shop??? For those wine lovers they have an international wine collection to choose from. Anyway, check out their menu and pricing online. Definitely make reservations and parking can be tricky since it's a popular venue for private parties, wedding etc. If it's a beautiful cool evening, definitely go for a short romantic walk on the small bridge overlooking the lake and a private garden for some French kissing under the moonlight - you get the idea. I could go on and on but you check it out for yourself!",

And the choices weren't even that appealing. The best dish seemed to be the chicken and forbidden rice, per server's recommendation. My mom got this, and it was actually pretty good. I ended up ordering tomato soup and pasta. The tomato soup was tasty, but I wish they had toned it down on the salt. I've had better at Panera. The pasta was so boring. Literally just a pink tomato sauce with a dash of basil and cheese on top. Now, I understand there's beauty in simplicity, but this was just flat out tasteless. I chose not to order the quiche or crepe to avoid that - other reviews noted those items were bland too.  For how expensive the dishes are, I would think they could hire better chefs or use some more ingredients.   They do have an amazing wine selection. So I would say if you're looking for somewhere to sit down and share a bottle of wine while overlooking a lake filled with beautiful black swans, come check this place out! But if you're looking to have an authentic French meal, move along...",

The food runners approach each table and don't know who has what entree. They announce the food and we're supposed to raise our hand, I suppose?  I watch all service aspects when I'm dining and every table had the same. The food runner also served my entree before my wife's which is inexcusable. It's a very easy fix. I would be more than happy to tell you how to fix that.  I'm sure everything can be done directly through your POS system. And this is the only imperfection of the night.

Summerlin's a completely foreign territory to me considering Henderson is more my home turf, haha.  We visited during the evening for a friend's birthday dinner. You first walk in through a wine shop in order to get to the restaurant area, which overlooks man-made Lake Jacqueline if you opt to sit outside. Not much of a view at night, but I'm sure it's picturesque during the day (did someone say brunch??) The ambiance is classy -- the patio was covered, fireplace and heat lamps in full effect. It was nice. Made me feel like a fancy pants.   Service pretty solid. The complimentary bread and butter was served hot and fresh. Our party of 6 shared the charcuterie platter as our appetizer which was okay. I had a glass of moscato and it was very sweet. I'm not much of a wine person, so this was perfect. For my entree, I ordered the Exotic and Wild Mushroom Risotto which is $16 for a half-size. The mascarpone cheese was creamy and the mushrooms a good balance to the risotto's consistency. My boyfriend got the Braised Beef Ravioli, also half-sized, but he finished his portion rather fast. I tried a small bite and it tasted rich. For dessert, we shared the lava cake which was okay. We had a couple bites of the creme brulee which we both agreed was way better.",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews for business that have more than a couple hundred reviews because, really, what's the point? But I really feel obligated to reiterate other reviews and praise this fine establishment.   Marche Bacchus is one of my most favorite restaurants in the valley. (These aren't in order of importance.)   1) it's not on the strip.  2) its location right by the lake is almost unfathomable when you think of a French restaurant in Las Vegas!  3) the ambiance of the restaurant is unbelievably romantic. The indoor dining area is beautiful. The outdoor area is absolutely gorgeous, especially at night.  4) the service is always attentive and warm. 5) the food is absolutely delicious. Try the duck (have it cooked medium), mushroom risotto (only if you absolutely love mushrooms and can appreciate specialty mushrooms other than white button mushrooms), escargot, meat and cheese plate, grilled octopus. Yes, I haven't had anything not good here.  6) price wise: you get more bang for your buck.   They even do weddings here and they are so easy to work with. They don't charge you to rent the space, which is rare for such a beautiful venue. (At least they didn't about two years ago, not sure if they do now.)   So, yes. Bring your girlfriends here (not all at once, of course) and you shall be doing at least one thing right.",

Came by for a lunch during restaurant week and brought my guy for dinner.    The goat cheese Napoleon is one of the best appetizers I've ever had, a crazy-great balance of sweet and savory coming from the honey and pistachio harmonizing with the cheese and phyllo dough. The chicken and forbidden rice dish was well-executed, particularly the black rice. Dessert was a beautiful creme brulee I was too full to finish. Server Scott was attentive, genuine, and professional throughout.  The menu had something for everyone,  and the lakeview patio is a big draw for date night.  Looking forward to coming back and browsing their wine shop!",

This is our second visit and the food is truly amazing when prepared as stated on the menu.  I ordered a Chopped Cobb salad and I had to inform the server once she de used to come by again that there were ingredients the menu stated came on the salad and they were not there.  Bacon is a component of the salad and there was NONE.  This baffles me, a simple Chopped salad and the kitchen forgets ingredients?  It makes me wonder what is really going on in the kitchen.  Is there not anyone checking the food before it leaves the kitchen?  The table right next to us had two ladies with a baby, one of the owners came by and said hi to them, she obviously knew them and the walked away...never said hi to us or asked if everything was ok, nothing.  As an owner you should take pride in your place and check on the people helping you make a living.    I covered the food issues and the owner issue now the service.  Our server took a long time to come to our table just to say hi for the first time.  She was really nice but would disappear and not come back for long periods.  When she brought my salad, fist off she should have noticed that it missing and most places of this caliber normally ask if you would like pepper with the salad but not here today.  Overall the food was good just a few items if fixed would make this place a 4 to 5 star place.",

    "text": "The outside patio by the lake is very nice but the food was mediocre and the service was an absolute disaster.  My mother informed our server about her dietary restrictions and was told that the lobster salad croissant did not contain onions. When she started eating, she tasted onions and asked the server again. He dismissed her and said there were just radishes and no onions. He didn't bother asking anyone in the kitchen about the ingredients or having it checked out after the initial complaint.   Aside from this, the service was terrible in every other way. We were brought bread but no plates for it. My father asked the barback for some olive oil and he looked at my father like he had no idea what he was saying. My father said he wanted olive oil for the bread. The barback said olive oil would be coming with my mother's salad and walked away (she had already ordered olive oil as her dressing). So we never got olive oil for the bread. We later asked the same barback for more bread. He looked annoyed and said to ask our server. We asked our server and he took 10 minutes to bring it and then set it down with an attitude and walked away. Our server never refilled our water or asked us how our food was. When we got the bill we also realized that the server tacked on 9 dollars for a house salad that was supposed to be included with the lobster roll on the lunch menu.   We complained to the manager about the ignored dietary restrictions and the manager confirmed the lobster roll does in fact have onions in it. The manager was gracious and helpful and took it off our bill. Then we had to tell her again about being charged 9 dollars for a house salad that was supposed to be included with the lunch and she took that off our bill too. So big thank you to the manager and to the owner who came by as they were super gracious and professional unlike the other staff at the restaurant.   Overall this was really disappointing. The food was mediocre at best. The lobster rolls had little lobster or flavor in them but the escargot was good. This was literally the worst service I've ever experienced and now my mother is suffering from heartburn due to the server not caring about her dietary restrictions. I eat out a few days a week and this was the second time in my life I didn't leave a tip. This is a great location with lots of potential but the staff need to learn how to treat customers.",

    "text": "I had an absolutely PHENOMENAL experience at Marche Bacchus. I am not sure if it was the company, the atmosphere, the food or the service, but it was simply wonderful.  I have wanted to try this place for quite awhile, but hadn't been able to make it in. It was my turn to plan date night and I figured this would be the perfect place to take my boyfriend. It ended up being more than I imagined and we both had a fabulous time.  I love how unassuming this place is - it's in a residential neighborhood and then in a business park within that area. When you enter, you are in the wine shop - note that they do not sell bottles of wine at the table, so if you want a bottle, take a few minutes to browse and find what you like, then take it to your table with you. You are able to purchase glasses of wine while at the table.  The service was fantastic - I really liked our server and will definitely go back to see her. The food was really good as well. We started out by sharing the Bacchus platter, which is basically the house charcuterie. It was a great selection and I enjoyed everything. My BF had the beef tenderloin and I had the steak frites. The steak was damn near one of the best I've ever had and was cooked to a perfect medium rare temperature. I also ordered an extra side of the goat cheese mashed potatoes, which were crazy good.  The ambiance is what really sets this place apart. You really don't feel like you are in Las Vegas - it's a serene feeling, on the lake watching swans float by. This is a great place for proposals - in fact, the couple at the table next to us got engaged while we were there.  Overall, this was an unforgettable experience and I can't wait to go back!",

Marche Bacchus has it all.  We requested their lakeside table, and we were promptly seated at the table with the best view! They are open for lunch, dinner and Sunday brunch. They have their own wine shop that offers a huge selection of wines from around the world. You can buy any bottle from the shop and have it opened for your dinner at the restaurant for only $10 corkage fee. Can't beat that price! You could open a Dom Perignon champagne and pay store price!!  For starters we had their summer salad and truffled goat cheese napoleon, both excellent. For entree I had their vegetable ravioli (they have a great selection of vegetarian and vegan dishes), my husband had their roasted Scottish salmon. Kids menu is awesome too. My kids loved the pasta in cream sauce and chicken fingers that came with worlds best fries!! Very reasonably priced kids menu, $6 each. Food is excellent and so is the ambience. We always request for Diana who is the BEST. She takes care of the smallest detail and knows the menu so well. She is very nice to my kids. The restaurant was packed on a Saturday evening, however her service was impeccable.  They have a great desert menu. We tired their cream brulee and chocolate lava cake. I highly recommend cream brulee.  Can't wait to return!!",

The owner came in and literally stood 1 foot from us and spoke to the \"rich\" couple with his back to us the the whole time.  When he was finished, do you think he would look our way and say, \"How is everything?\" Heck no!  I won't even mention the food.

If I would actually have one critique to management it would be that the younger servers don't really know wine. So I recommend asking to speak to someone who would be confident making a suggestion. Now about the outside dining... We live in Las Vegas people. Sometimes it's going to be hot. Sometimes cold. I recommend ordering something cold, maybe sparkling, when it's hot outside and vice versa. This is a lovely place and I hope the people giving the staff a hard time don't come back and ruin my dining experience.  Oh! About the service. I've never had a bad experience. In fact I appreciate that the staff leaves me and my guests alone enough to talk and drink our wine and not that constant \"everything going alright over here? Anything for dessert?\" routine you get from the big corporate restaurants trying to turn tables and maximize revenue.",

It was incredibly embarrassing at how horrible the service was and I was mortified to have brought my friends to dine there. The whole experience was over 3.5 hours long because the service was painstakingly slow. 2 friends ordered the same drink, yet they looked and tasted different. When they questioned the waiter they received attitude. One friend ordered a drink and was told the bartender didn't know how to make it. I'm sorry, why do you have something on the menu that the staff is not trained to make? I do have to say the food was very good, it just took forever for it to be delivered. When my friend asked one of the waiters if she could take a picture of us, she replied \"I need to go check on another table, so if I have time I will\". Wow ok. For the amount of money they charge I expect the service to match. I'm sad to say I think my days at this restaurant are through.",

We loved the atmosphere and the wine selection was pretty incredible...the misters were a little strong but very welcome in the intense desert heat.   I'd like to think I know my way around a wine store and am familiar with most of the drinkable labels at our price point but I'll say that Bacchus had a ton of really interesting finds and labels that surprised us...we picked out a great white to accompany the meal, it was certainly value priced for being in a restaurant.  The wine market feel was definitely unique, definitely got us both engaged in the dining experience.    Our server was amazing, his stories and witicisms were thoughtful and interesting, it was evident that he loved the job and took great pride in his service.  The food was great and they knocked it out of the park, my only disappointment was the octopus which was underdone, a little chewy and fishy...I'm sure this was a one off as I've read other reviews that celebrate the octopus so we were just unlucky that night. I had the pork chop, a great recommendation and my wife had the halibut which was perfectly prepared.  Very unexpectedly our server brought us a complimentary dessert wine with our dessert as we were celebrating an anniversary.  All in all, a great night out, a great meal, as Vegas locals now this will be one of our go to spots.  We will definitely be back to Bacchus and next time I'll give the octopus another chance!",

Note to wait staff: read and learn the new menu instead of contradicting your customers who do read the new menu.  I ordered their Brie Burger ($15.00) which now comes with some kind of \"chutney\" on it. This chutney was more like tasteless marinara sauce and so much was poured on the burger that it could not be picked up; I had to eat it with a knife and fork. At one point I pulled a large piece of gristle out of my mouth and placed it on the side of my plate. Their burger was a messy disappointment.  My GF had their lobster crepe ($21.00) which she said was OK if a bit on the small side.   The restaurant's lakeside location was nice, but what impressed us most about it, unfortunately, was the large number of bugs that constantly landed in our drinks. We had to have our water glasses replaced a couple of times and we eventually had to give up drinking any liquids at our table; the thirsty bugs were relentless.   My overall impression of Marche Bacchus: it is an alternative if you want to drop a lot of money on overpriced, mediocre food at a restaurant but don't want to drive all the way to the Strip. We won't be back.",

I didn't try their house red wine but I suppose it would be keeping with their European theme and have heavy tannic taste to it.",

Chef Dave met with my fiance days before the proposal and together, they created a custom menu including all of my favorite dishes. Paul gave Dave the ring (trusting guy, eh??) and he kept it safe and sound until the proposal.   After dinner (which was totally fantastic), the waitstaff brought out dessert-- a plate with a silver cover over it. They set the dish down and removed the cover to reveal a beautiful dessert with an even more beautiful diamond ring! Of course, I said YES!! Everyone clapped and cheered and the waitstaff brought champagne and an additional dessert for us to enjoy.   It was the perfect setting for the perfect dinner for the perfect proposal!",

I walked away feeling totally gypped as the food was no better than a run of the mill chain restaurant.  I'm a turkey snob and this was average at best.   The $15 glass of Pinot was so sweet I didn't finish it.   I asked for a cup of coffee and it came out cold.   Waiter still charged me for it anyway.  The soup was too sweet and not hot.

This is particular a good choice for a romantic evening, or comfortable and nice enough for a group of friends for an afternoon.  Delightful.

We were seated right at the edge of the lake, with a beautiful view of a full moon and Jupiter (thanks, Android app!).  We shared a bottle of the best Riesling ever, and also a warm spinach salad, with pancetta and a bread crisp spread with goat cheese - yum!  Alas, the restaurant was out of the hanger steak that we - and every table around us - wanted to order.  The waiter said they hadn't gotten their meat delivery today as planned.  Instead, I had the Trout, which was served with a topping of crabmeat, haricots verts, and balsamic-soaked shallots.  It had way too much salt for my taste, but I was going to keep it anyway.  Instead, the waiter whisked it away, the owner, Jeff, came over and said that the kitchen would whip up a fresh one, with no salt at all added.  And they did, quickly!  Yes, the fish could have used a touch of salt, but not after I spread out that balsamic drizzle.  It was absolutely delicious.  My husband had the salmon, and it was also terrific.  We had ordered - 30 minutes ahead, as required - the house special bread pudding with cinnamon sauce.  Two other tables had birthday celebrants, and they had the usual candle and Happy Birthday jingle sung.  My bread pudding was served sans candle, and no Happy Birthday song.  Instead, the waiter got down on one knee, took my hand, and serenaded me with a very professional rendition of \"La Vie en Rose!\"  Edith Piaf herself couldn't have done it better.  The icing on the cake, so to speak, was that the house comped my birthday dessert, even after we presented our <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate.  A far cry from last birthday's mess, when all the hassles and waiting produced nothing at all.    All in all, it was a terrific dining experience, a wonderful dinner, and we're not going to wait a whole 'nother year to return.",

    "text": "Marche Bacchus is an awesome restaurant from top to bottom. The atmosphere, the wine, the food & the experience all play into making it one of my all time favorites.The location is off-strip, located in Summerlin, positioned lake-side within a neighborhood. This gives a great ambiance, allowing you to disassociate from the city-life/fast pace of Vegas and really hone into having a relaxing evening with great food, wine & company. The wine store turns into a beautiful dining room, making it truly a unique experience to dine here. You have the option to pick out wine prior to seating, get up during your meal to pick-out more, and also purchase wine to go.   We dine here frequently off their a la carte menu, but especially love when they host events or wine dinners. Bastille Day was one of our favorite events, but most recently we dined here for the Freemark Abbey Wine Dinner on Thursday Jan 19th, 2017. The restaurant does wine dinners about once a month, really highlighting a specific winery & setting up a tasting menu to really highlight the wine, and showcase the level of cuisine at Marche Bacchus. This wine dinner was especially interesting because the restaurant is celebrating bringing in a new executive chef Tom Moloney.   The pairing was six unique glasses with four delicious courses:  1.) appetizer: Butter poached Maine lobster w/ heirloom tomatoes, popcorn shoots, sweet onion, red radish in a lobster sauce 2.) second course: Roasted Stuffed Quail w/ Foie Gras + exotic wild mushrooms  3.) third/main course: 28 day dry-aged Ribeye w/ marble potatoes, mushrooms in a cab sauv. reduction 4.) fourth course: Artisan cheese plate  Overall the meal, and pairing was absolutely fantastic. The Butter poached Maine lobster was an excellent portion of fresh lobster, really delicious and representing a umami in flavor.   The second course though, was my absolute favorite. I have never had the pleasure of eating quail before (first experience) and it was absolutely phenomenal. I loved the sizing of the bird & smallness of the bones within the wing. The cook was delicious, roasted to perfection and evenly stuffed with wild mushrooms & foie gras.  I was worried that because I enjoyed the quail so much the steak would lack in luster. I was VERY incorrect. The steak was perfectly cut and cooked, oozing with flavor and really diverse from the previous course/pairing. I absolutely loved the Cabernet Sauvignon reduction, and had only wished the potato portion had been more, or prepared as pommes puree to soak up the reduction & delicious flavoring.  The artisan cheese plate followed, consisting of a selection soft & mild cheeses. I prefer more obtuse bodied and aged cheeses, making this not my favorite of cheese selections. I loved, LOVED the idea of having cheese over a sweet desert, and adored the pickled peppers/onions so much I stole my boyfriends though!  We ended the meal with cappuccinos & an additional tasting of 1984 Freemark Abbey in the wine shop. Everyone seemed to enjoy themselves immensely, and conversation carried late into the evening. The owners Tom & Rhonda really know how to throw an awesome event, and run an outstanding food & beverage establishment. Can't wait till our next meal, and especially till the next wine dinner!",

The service was SO SLOW that we were there almost 4 hours and not by choice.  Not once did a manager or owner show up to offer an apology.  The food was better than average, however by the time we got our meals we would have thought a boiled work boot tasty.  I won't ever return but hope that they hire enough staff to give better service.  There are a ton of quality employees looking for jobs.  Hire some if business is so good!!",

    "text": "Finally! The meal I have been waiting for in Las Vegas.  Amazing atmosphere, delicious food, exceptional service, and a reasonable price tag. Do yourself a favor and eat here tonight! I will first reiiterate what others have said...the wine shop in the front is such a great idea.  The store has an excellent selection and something for every price range.  My one regret was that we had to drive home and I  couldnt enjoy this feature even more.   My boyfriend and I started with the beet salad.  It was light, flavorful, and beautifully presented.  I was impressed with how the chef paired the fish with the beets so succesfully.  For the entree my boyfriend had the cod.  It was smooth and buttery and served on a lovely pilaf.  I have to say my entree- a special that evening- was certainly the best.  Salmon with a wasabi creme sauce served over soba noodles with chunks of lobster...my mouth is watery just remembering it! We decided on the bread pudding for dessert and the 20 minute wait time gave us a chance to sober up before the drive home.  The pudding reminded me of my mom's - served piping hot with lovely hints of cimmamon and a delightfully sweet warm rum sauce (i think i could have drank that sauce as a cocktail!) Last but certainly not least...the atmosphere.  It was a breath of  fresh air to sit lakeside and watch the sun set as our spirits rose.  If you want a romantic, memorable, delicious dinner head to Marche Bacchus tonight!",

When my sandwich came it was on bread with Rye. I do not like Rye. He took it away to remake it. Minutes later another person comes back with the same sandwich telling me it was not Rye, you could see the seeds all over the bread. I was told they were going to remake the entire sandwich. They take it away again to make it on white. When I finally got my sandwich it was not a \"new\" sandwich, they just put white bread on it. The sandwich is supposed to be hot, it was not. It was cold. Yuck! By the time I got my sandwich everyone had finished eating. I paid for a terrible sandwich that arrived after my friends had eaten. Very slow service!!!!  I have been here many times before with friends. This is my last time.",

    "text": "Let me first start out with my gripe and get it off my chest so I can move on with my life (just kidding, kinda). So I made reservations about 6 weeks prior to Bastille Day, for brunch, we had a group of 10, so I wanted to make sure I gave plenty of notice (I'm a planner). I arrive the day of, led out to the patio area, and the hostess says, I'm so sorry, I thought we had the table ready. So I'm led to another area of the patio and seated. It's July 11, and when I made the reservation, I wasn't anticipating sitting outside, so I didn't bother requesting inside. I see there are quite a few people outside, and they had fans going, so I decided to toughen up and enjoy it (I love outside dining, just not when it's 108 degrees out). As we are sitting there, the misters would shoot on for 2 seconds and shut off, I asked our waitress if there was any way they could leave them on, she said they \"were working on it\". As the table is sitting there, all of us are dressed up, we are all dripping with sweat and having a hard time enjoying ourselves. As we are leaving, the hostess apologizes for the heat and asked us \"did your waitress tell you what happened\" we said no, she said a customer had decided to try and redirect one of the misters directly on him and it broke the entire system, the hostess then followed it up with \"your waitress should've offered to move you girls inside\". Little late now. Also, I had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> voucher that I attempted to use, if anyone is familiar with those, they are very specific on the voucher about day, times, etc about when you can use them. My voucher only stated not valid on alcohol. So, they would not accept my voucher because they said their system is only set up to accept the vouchers for dinner (does not state this anywhere) the mgr claimed he has been meaning to contact them to correct it. That's my rant.   The food. Our brunch was amazing. Every single dish. A few stand outs were, French Toast, Lobster Salad Croissant and of course the Croque Madame. The Creme Brulee was delicious, I attempted to get the bread pudding, but they were out of vanilla ice cream, and the waitress tried talking me into subbing mango ice cream instead, which sounded terrible together.   I enjoyed my food enough to overlook the service issues we had and to come back and dine again.",

We have gone to this restaurant a few times, just for the view of the water. The food is overpriced and just mediocre. I was very specific about where we wanted to be seated. When we arrived on time for our 7:00 p.m. reservation, the requested table was not available. The hostess was going to give us another table, which would of seated 6. There were only 3 of us. The owner, Jeff then refused to give us this table. The other tables offered by the other owner, Rhonda were not acceptable to my wife. This is not the first time we have had problems, but will definitely be our last. We ended up leaving and going to Echo & Rig in Tivoli Village, where our business is appreciated. I have been associated with the restaurant business sine 1972 and I must say the restaurant is a big disappointment. Just wanted to add that I wonder if the owners look at all the bad reviews. Apparently not, since they seem to go back for quite a while and nothing has changed.",

Our server, Marty, was very nice and made several suggestions. I ordered the scallops (on his recommendation) and they were delicious. Silver dollar-sized, perfectly seared, nestled on a bed of broccolini, sweet grape tomatoes, apricots, and capers. Delicious! I don't remember what the sauce was, but I wanted to lick the plate clean.  My friend had asked for a table by the water, and we were delighted by all the \"wildlife\" that came to the water's edge just a few feet from our table at the open window:  Five black swans, 2 turtles, and a mama duck with 13 babies! Yes, 13! They were so cute and fun to watch.   Birds flew in and out of the porch area where we sat. Not a problem per se, but there were droppings on the floor. :-/  We enjoyed our dinner and the \"show\" very much. The creme brulee was ordinary, and had a nice crunch to the top.   The food was a little pricey, but delicious. For two entrees, with no alcoholic drinks, plus bottled water and dessert, the bill was $90 before tip.",

    "text": "I Hate long reviews, but I wanted to share my most recent experience here:  Went to have lunch last Saturday and BOY what a waste of time and money. I've been coming here for years and I know that it is a hit or miss most of the time. It was packed, which is fine, they were setting up for large parties, but we were severely neglected (even though we were one of like 7 tables seated). Our server looked like she was having the WORST day of her life, and I don't resent her for it, who know what's what.   We ordered Bloody Marys, which were basically shrimp cocktail sauce in a glass. I get using some horseradish in the mix, but the consistency and the flavor intensity was just straight up cocktail sauce. So disappointing because my man and I came a little hungover and were really looking forward to it. My pet peeve in restaurants is when stuff is sent out without anyone checking the food or doing a drink taste test. UGH!!!   I had a french onion soup. It came with a large crouton with cheese on top of it. It was extremely inconvenient to eat, I was struggling with that big chunk of bread, glued to the cheese for a while. Tasty though. I'd really recommend dropping a piece of toasted bread in the soup and baking the cheese over the bowl, it's what French Onion Soup is ALL about, the cheese factor! I mean Google the thing for F sake and you will see many amazing ways of presenting this awesome dish!   The bf had a blue cheese burger. He eats red meat like once in a year and was looking forward to it. Medium rare.... came out well done, extra dry and there was a very conservative drop of blue cheese on there. Meh.   I had a turkey sandwich with cranberry sauce. First bite was like biting into smelly fish. The turkey was completely spoiled. I thought it was just me (because of the night before), the bf did a taste test and we sent it back. There was no significant reaction from the server, like AT ALL. And 20 min later she comes by and says \"I'll take that off the bill for ya okaaay?\" Like she was doing us a favor. We both looked at her and said \"uhh... yeah, you will!\"   We noticed other patrons sending food back and the owner did absolutely nothing about coming over and talking to the guests or making apologies. Every time I see him, he just strikes me as a huge huge douche. And knowing this place (and many people who have worked here) he is and so is his wife. No wonder there is no enthusiasm in this place and why their employee turnover is so high. Shame.  Do yourself a favor, skip lunch and have a dinner here. Service will always be total sh*t, but it's great atmosphere for you and your love and if you stick to perhaps the cheese plate, the muscles and other simpler items, you will not be disappointed.",

The view of the lake, service, food, and John topped off the wonderful evening.    It was during Restaurant Week but we decided to order off the regular menu.  John approached us and greeted us.  He was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable when it came to the menu.  He made some recommendations and we were happy to heed his suggestions.  We order several appetizers, entrees and shared everything family style.  I preordered a dessert for my guests since I had to leave in the middle of dinner.  I had informed John and he was more than able to accommodate.  I was a little concerned about how I was able to tender the payment, include his gratuity, and be able to depart, but John took matters into his own hands and put my mind at ease.  He even called me after to reassure me of the final bill and thanked us for coming in.  Very professional and very appreciated.   Everything from the moment we walked in to the time I left, was fantastic.  Everyone was engaging and seemed like they enjoyed their job and provide the service they did.  John was very attentive and extremely friendly, something that is somewhat rare these days!  Although I was amongst guest who did not drink, I was would be remised if I didn't mention their wine selection.  That in itself is definitely worth visiting for!  You can go shopping for a bottle of wine and then enjoy it at dinner or take it home, pretty awesome!  After conferring with my guest after dinner, they too really appreciated the service and told me that they most surely will return with friends and family.  The food and ambience at Marche has always been consistent but this time, the service was well above par.  I, we will definitely come back and visit John! Kuddos!",

My wife and I had lunch and dinner with friends there a number of times. We like its sampler appetizer plate with several kinds of meats, pate, cheeses, olives, and preserves. Although this appetizer plate looks small, it is actually enough for 4 people to share over a drink. For entree, we love its scallops and duck dishes. For dessert, we like its popular bread pudding, which has a pleasing texture and not too sweet. The serving staff is very friendly and attentive. One evening, the restaurant was completely full, but our busy and efficient waiter (Justin) still managed to take good care of our table of 4!  Marche Bacchus is a must visit, at least for lunch on its gorgeous patio deck by the water in a hot Vegas day! Do ask for patio seating when making a reservation. But actually, its small, comfortable dining room is not bad either, the large windows do let you see a bit of the soothing water. My wife and I enjoy taking our out-of-town guests there. They are invariably amazed by the fact that such beautiful water ways exists in the middle of Vegas desert, and the restaurant is located in such a nice residential area by the water!  By the way, the front section of the restaurant is a medium size wine store. You can select a bottle of wine there for your table. Even after the corking fee, the wine is still a pretty good bargain!  - My only disappointment with Marche Bachus is that it does NOT offer Happy Hour! I'd have given it 5-Star, if only it offered happy hours!  Peterskis, June 2012 -----",

This is my oasis in the desert. Just sitting out on the patio with a glass of wine looking out over the water makes me forget all my worries. I also love that the menu changes seasonally, providing me with exciting new choices (although there are times when I really miss some dishes but have to wait to have them again, like the short ribs in the winter -- delicious!). This is also a really great place for lunch if you're not on a strict schedule. Such tastiness should not be rushed!",

Very bland flavor lacking garlic and wine. The seared scallops were cooked perfectly and accompanying vegetables were sparse but tasty. My son had the French Onion Soup, another big disappointment. The beef stock was too beefy and overbearing, almost had a tomato flavor (how they did that we can't figure out). The cheese was a weak gruyere, if it even was gruyere. His steak was served rare as asked for, but the sauce was a little runny and not what he expected. The bleu cheese was blended into the sauce and would have been better in visible chunks on the filet. My husband was happy with the foie GRAS and with his duck. But when the coffee came with half and half in tiny  pre-packaged containers, that did it. Where was the Creme? The menu is French influenced, but I have a hard time considering this a truly French restaurant.",

Grab a table outside and you're likely to hear live music during dinner (most nights, not sure if all) while gazing out at the water.  Wine lover?  That's the next best (best?) part.  The wine shop is adjacent (part of?) the restaurant and you're welcome to stroll the aisles to pick out your bottle at retail prices plus a $10 corking fee. Bonus!  Wine AND water.  In Vegas.  To music.  Oh, the food? Excellent. We just went with the specials of the night, finishing up with their fantastic bread pudding (which I'm usually not a big fan of). Then again, we were on bottle three by dessert...  My new favorite Summerlin spot.  Will be back soon to comment more.  UPDATE 9/22: I only return to restaurants if I like them (obviously) but I rarely return to a restaurant two days later unless I absolutely LOVE it. And yes, I went back two days later to try their Sangria Sunday.  Sundays bring more live music and Sangria added to the menu. Also added to the menu are 4 tapas (small plate) items that ranged from $7 to $11 each on this visit.  We sampled 3 of the 4 tapas dishes (some twice) and their outstanding escargot.  Kobe Beef Meatballs in a roasted tomato sauce...mmmmm.  The homemade sausage plate however was the best sausage I've ever had. Yes, great sausage.  This trip was finished off with the waiter's recommendation of the flourless chocolate cake, which we were going to skip based on the menu description. But don't skip it - fantastic if you like chocolate!  Live music, great drinks, great food, while dining on an outdoor patio set on the water? Yup, I'll be back AGAIN soon.",

Service was amazing; our waiters would were very experienced, well-versed, kind, helpful, and attentive. Their wine selection was extensive and exquisite. The Braised Beef was delicious, juicy and tender, and had a side of mashed potatoes that were out of this world. The pork porterhouse had a very tasty sear and sauce, but the cut of meat was grisly and tough in some places. The polenta dish was unbelievable; it is on the vegetarian menu but tasted hearty, buttery, and fabulous. The French onion soup was the best I have had in Las Vegas, and the Ahi Tuna Poke was also phenomenal. Unfortunately, the desserts were not as pleasing. The tiramisu was a little dry, and the bread pudding was a bit underdone. Overall, the French meal and feel offered at Marche Bacchus is highly superior as well as enjoyable.",

It was so sweet and delicately cooked to perfection. Our second course was a duck done 3 ways dish.  On top a very generous portion of foie gras that was crispy and so melt-in your mouth soft in the center. Third was the meat course, I'm a beginning eat meater for my filet was a little under done but to everyone else it was cooked well. Lastly they brought out an espresso cake with liquid chocolate ganash on the side to pour over it, it was perfection.  We found a couple of bottles of wine and that my partner said were very well priced to enjoy over dinner. Great selection of wine by the glass along with their bottles. The manager was very well knowledged and didn't pick out the most expensive bottle when we asked him for suggestions, but picked out bottles that best fit the description of the wine we wanted to purchase.  The wine shop offers *FREE* wine tasting on Saturday mornings from 1130-230.  It's never really crowed, but  a good way to get people interested in the restaurant and wine shop.  Can't wait to eat there again!",

After getting seated outside on the patio (which is very nice, overlooking the lake), we sat for 15-20 minutes before being offered drinks.   Strike one.  I had to flag down a waiter, who was not even ours to get drinks ordered.  Then, they ran out of coffee and \"had to brew more\".  Took a while to get coffee, during a Sunday Brunch?  We had to send the cream back because it smelled bad. I ordered the crab and asparagus eggs benedict.  Very little crab, just shredded crab, no chunks.   The H sauce over powered the dish, very salty,  My wife ordered the lobster salad croissant.  I tasted it and thought it was fake lobster.  We called the manager over to the table and asked him.  He said he had to check with the chef.  He comes back and says it is 60% lobster and 40% crab.  Huh?  He did not seem to think there was anything wrong with that.  He acted like that was okay to do.  It says \"lobster\" on the menu, so it should be 100% lobster.  I am convinced it was the fake stuff too.  Overall, the food was below average,  and the service was even worse.  Everyone in our group felt this way, it was not just me.  Slow to refill coffee and water, and very slow to get food.  The staff seemed to not really care either,  it was just like they were going through the motions, no passion.  Also, last comment, the glass windows need to be cleaned.  If the lake view is your thing, clean the class.  In the end, very disappointed and we will not be back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. I have heard good things about it and it is one of the only \"nice\" restaurants in the Northwest but overall I was struggling to really \"like it\". I ultimately gave it a three based upon the food as that is what I primarily consider, I would provide it a four based on decor and ambiance.  First off, I really like the wine shop and they had some good wines at decent prices. Also, the $10 corkage fee is attractive and I like that you can buy a wine right there. We sat out on the patio, this too I liked. There was live music, a saxophonist, a little loud but still nice. It was a small little alcove next to the water which provided an intimate feel. The service was prompt and pleasant as well.   We had the steak tar-tare appetizer, this was tasty. Also, I had the French Onion soup. I love French Onion soup and this was a nice surprise, probably my favorite part of the meal, light sherry undertone and very rich. I ordered the Risotto with truffles. Risotto was too al dente for my taste and was under-seasoned. The risotto was $18. I shared this entry with my husband who ordered the Lobster Pot Pie. The pot pie was also disappointing; they would have been well served to have called it Lobster stew. There was a good amount of lobster in the \"pie\", but there should be especially in light of the hefty $40 price tag. But the flavor was lacking and it was not rich and creamy but more soupy. We had the Lobster Pot Pie at Michael Mina in SF and it was phenomenal for about the same price or possibly even less. And don't get me wrong I have no qualms with spending money on a great meal, I will gladly do so, but I still like to review each meal on it's own and by comparison with other restaurants at similar price points.   Our other dinner companion had the duck breast. I tried a piece of his and it was very moist and had a good flavor. Overall, nice decor and food was good, but not good enough for me to come running back here when there are so many other places in LV to try and not quite sure why they made it into the 50 essential restaurant book.",
