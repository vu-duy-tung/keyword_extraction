    "text": "So I've been in Las Vegas since Sunday and this place haunts me like a beautiful woman passing me on the strip, for that split second your eyes lock trying not to blink then the moment passes, but that moment stays with you. Try as you might you find yourself  drawn back in. The food is really good and and I love drinking black velvets until I exode. As many of you know my son can be a handful when it comes to food. He loves eating here and the wait staff is incredible when it comes to dealing with him asking them alot of questions, Kelly was really nice to my son and daughter. I'll be back every time I come to Las Vegas. This pub is so awesome on the inside, when you come here as for a couch tables if they have one available. I really like this place and will miss it when I leave, but I will return to Las Vegas if only for the Nine Fine Irishmen.",

I had the NY Strip steak that came with Bleu Cheese on it. It was perfect and I can't wait to go back and get it again.   This was our second time here and each time has been great. The after-9pm entertainment is usually great as well.  Reservations are recommended during busy dinner hours on weekends. Otherwise it's usually not overcrowded.",

    "text": "Before heading back to LA, I wanted a good meal for the four and half hour drive - I wasn't planning to come here but as my mom and I roamed around New York New York...I asked her what she wanted to eat and she said something new - and when we passed by this place - I thought well she never had Irish food before might as well let her try it now. They weren't busy probably because it was only 11am - we got seated upstairs right by the second bar - when looking down there was another bar downstairs.   As we were looking through the menu, our cheery and sweet waitress came by asking what we would like to drink - usually my mom likes orange juice but she wanted to try something new so I asked her to whip up some kind of fruit punch for us....whatever she mixed up was pretty good.  The service was friendly and great but the food was equally as good. We ordered: the Beer Battered Onion Rings with spicy mustard to share - I usually don't like onion rings but ordered it cause my mom does - but I actually really liked these onion rings  - they were crispy and I didn't even need to dip into the spicy mustard - for the batter already had a good taste.  I really like corn beef so I got the Corn Beef Sandwich on Marbled Rye with Cole Slaw as the side. The sandwich was tasty unfortunately the Cole Slaw lacked dressing. Maybe get it with the fries or potatoes would be better.  My mom had the Irish Breakfast which came with Corn Beef Hash, Banger, Two Eggs, Potatoes and Toast. I actually had some and the corn beef hash was good and also really liked how they made the scrambled eggs.   The portions were pretty big and we didn't finish any of the food and ended up taking it back home....and even after a 4 hour and half car ride my sandwich was still pretty good.  Overall good service, good food - the only slight complaint was the price - for the two of us the bill out to be around $50ish and plus tip it was almost 60...that's pretty pricey for lunch in my opinion and we didn't even have beer or any alcohol.",

    "text": "First, atmosphere is great. Very cozy and comfortable whether you are at the bar, a high top, table, or outside (whether thats outside the bar inside the casino, or outside the casino itself on LVB).  Bartenders are friendly & fast.  I like their selection of beers on tap & the drink menu. The Dubliner, btw, is THE best, sour apple martini I've ever had!!  Second, Darryl is just amazing.  Ireland's loss is definitely Vegas' gain. Unlike some performers on the Strip, he's not pretentious, is friendly, and will stop for a quick chat during breaks. The entire band performs well together & they are some of the most talented musicians I've seen. I really like that if you step outside there are speakers so you can still hear the music during your ciggy/cigar break.   Third, the food. Not terribly impressed.  Whether its actual Irish fare I don't know. What I do know is that the menu is terribly overpriced.  $21.95 for fish & chips, presented in an upright wired cone basket. There was way more batter than fish & at times it tasted as if the fish wasn't fried long enough.  There is nothing special here...even with lemon, ketchup, malt vinegar, it was still bland.  All in all, it wasn't anything you couldn't get at Yard House or for $10 at the fish & chip shack in the food court at NY NY.  Fourth, I've been a server so I can speak to this. I found none of the servers to be \"ok.\" Our server rarely checked on us. We were constantly having to flag her down for drinks and then wait, and wait, and wait some more, for her return.  I was still working on my meal when she attempted to take my plate...without asking.  Granted, she was very nice, but just bc you're really nice doesn't mean you're good at your job.  Fifth, I made reservations. One of the hostesses flat out lied to me, was not friendly, and just made one excuse after another. And I called her on it.  Upon arrival I requested a specific table and was told it was reserved for a large party. Fine, I get it. Until she sat the 2 guys in line behind me without reservations at the table I just asked for. (There were 3 in my party.)  If you are looking for a place to hang out, have a few HALF pints, and dance (or watch others dance) a jig & take in some great live music, this place is it. Unlike The Bar at Times Square where you must exit the bar to use the restroom, Nine Fine has them. Outdoor seating is quite spacious & there is a full bar there as well so you don't have to shuffle in/out for drinks.  I gave this place 3 stars bc of the food & service alone; otherwise, 5 stars.",

Good job, gal!), and there was a lot of positive interaction between the staff upstairs and down; they really seemed to enjoy each other and their jobs! Food was FANTASTIC! Wonderful fish and chips; (presentation a treat, too!) Tasty cabbage soup with bacon , ( can't remember the name-sorry!), and delicious ladyfinger/Jameson whiskey dessert! (I really should have wrote this while I was there!) My husband had flat iron steak salad, and was equally pleased! Nice, fun oasis in a hectic city!",

She was cutting us off when we talked and correcting us when we talked. She kept trying to walk away from us when we were trying to order. The food took FOREVER to get to us. We were starving by the time it got here. We $35 for a steak that was tiny as heck and $6 just to add some asparagus. She then talked down to us about our \"split check\" because the hostess didn't tell us that with a 5 person party it should have been in one check?! Why? And again she took forever with the check with an explanation that the card with chips take more than a few minutes to process. Really. Sounds like user error. I gave them a second star because the chicken pot pie was bomb. But that's all. Might be worth it for some. But not for most.",

We walked through the restaurant inside and the decor looks great but we preferred to sit outside. They just renovated the outside area and it's a good place to hang out at.   They have a rectangle bar outside that has seats all around three sides. One side is left open facing the strip so people can walk up and get their drinks to go. There are also tables to sit at if you prefer that. The bartenders were nice and attentive and the drinks weren't too expensive. We got a beer, three whiskey cokes, a red bull, and an adios and it came out to $53. That's especially good in Vegas and the drinks weren't weak either.   I'd for sure come back to this place again, possibly to try the food next time as well.",

I ate half of it, and Ron had a few bites.  The sauce was thin, and tho it wasn't delicious, it didn't taste that bad.  Ron had bangers and mash that he enjoyed.   Needless to say,  I awoke sometime in the night nauseous,  and was sick the entire night until there was nothing left in my stomach!  Ron was queezy in the a.m.,  but nothing like what I went through.  I will never eat here again,",

As we ordered, she apparently tried to memorize  our order, but then figured out she needed to write things down (and we started over).  The food; while the flavors were ok, temperatures were cold to Luke warm. Obviously everything sat on the pass out for a while.

    "text": "Was just here for a summer weekend for my birthday. We stayed at NY NY and decided to check it out when we first arrived. So glad we came here! The live band was playing drunken irish songs. When we walked by the band to go to the our table, every band member looked at us, gave us a smile. We totally felt welcomed. Pretty awesome. Every couple of songs or so, a girl would come up at the stage and perform an irish dance.  Want to drink, meet and just with a chill and very friendly crowd? Come to this pub.  If you want to eat without band music, they do have patio seating that gives you a view of the strip. This is where we sat for dinner. We were able to chat without having to yell at each other, and at the same time, enjoyed watching people walk by. Good selection of food, drinks, and of course, whiskey!! I do like my whiskeys so that is all I ordered for drinks. Salmon, especially the mac and cheese and mashed potatoes are to die for!! We ordered them the first night we got there, and let me tell you, I was craaaaaving them the whole time we were in vegas! Matter of fact, I am still craving them. Definitely going back to this bar. Definitely going to order the mac/cheese and mashed potato and try their other dishes. This bar is located at NY NY hotel. I definitely recommed you check out this place if you're staying at this hotel.  The service was ok. A little slow but there were only two servers that night (around 9pm). Our server was very nice though and very apologetic. As busy as they were, she was still calm and did keep coming back to us to ask of we were ok. So service was ok, but I still give this a 5 star. My overall experience was great! I can't wait to come back!",

Lunch menu was a little pricey to us Texans but about average for Las Vegas. Appetizers range from $8-12. Meals mostly $12-20. We highly recommend beer cheese with the homemade chips and fried sausage. Shepard's pie was delicious and deep. Don't let the circumstance of the dish fool you. It's very filling even for an Italians appetite. :) fish and chips, tomato and cheese dish were also great. If you are in the area, definitely try it out.",

They sat us in no man's land where apparently not only were there no other diners, there were also no servers. Yikes!  We waited for a long time before finally flagging someone down. We shared the sausage appetizers. Good for the first few bites but damn, that's a lot of sausage! I know, I know... that's what she said.  Anyway, the sausage became pretty one note and we ended up not finishing it or ordering anything else. Our server disappeared again, pretty much never to be seen or heard from again.  I will say though that I've had some pretty rockin' food here in the past. Their sandwiches are good, especially the curried chicken.   Would I hit up Nine Fine again? Probably, but during daylight hours and I'd insist on having an actual server.",

Once seated we got quick and very friendly service. We had chicken wings, nothing very exotic, but they came quick and tasted very good. All the time we were seated we got super service from the staff.   A band started to play Irish music downstairs, so after the chicken wings we went down to see the band. And they were really good, playing a mix of Irish folk songs, Irish rock classics and other rock tunes played in an Irish sort of way. Nice! The atmosphere in the pub was genuinely good, and we totally forgot that we were inside a hotel in Las Vegas.  All in all, this is a place I would like to come back to, anytime.",

Normally, the place is wonderful, the drinks and appetizers are wonderful, and we really enjoy the live music. The staff has always been very attentive and made sure we were enjoying our night.  However, our last visit forced me to drop it down at least one star, and considered dropping it two. The hostesses were very cold, making us feel like they were doing us a favor even speaking to us. We were seated out in the \"patio\" area, which means out by the casino floor. This was ok. We wanted to chat with a business associate, so this worked for us.  Our waitress was TERRIBLE - bossy, rude, and very condensing. Her attitude made us want to leave very quickly, and we will probably request another waitress/waiter on our next visit (which is something we normally would never do)  The food was great....the music was great....the service, meh.",

And that's where the star-ness ends.  - We were told we'd have a 15-20 minute wait, which was fine... until half an hour went by and we went from buzzed, happy-but-hungry to straight up sober and hangry. When finally seated, we were brought to a very private table at the top of the stairs near the back which we initially thought was awesome, except we later suspected they put us there just to forget about us.  - After receiving our waters, my husband and I added Mio flavoring to ours. Our waitress passed by and immediately got snotty with us and demanded to know who had gotten us a drink so that she could add it to our tab. Wtf.  - Only ONE page for the entire dinner menu, including salads and appetizers? Pathetic.  - My husband ordered the lamb stew, and for nearly $20, boy was it lackluster. Considering how mediocre and mushy it was, they could at least have served him more than one ladle-full.  - While at dinner for over an hour, our waters were NEVER refilled. Not even once.  - Between the six of us multiple salads, stew, fried sausages, and onion rings were ordered. The ONLY things worth ordering were the appetizers (which were delicious). No joke. No one even finished their boring, overpriced salads.  - A bus boy brought us a basket of starter bread when we were almost done with our meal. Thanks, I guess.  Needless to say, we were especially miffed that we were forced to tip a rude waitress who basically showed up to our table only to take our orders and then give us our bill. (Please keep in mind that we received this awful service on a weekday evening in the slow month of February.)  I've worked in the service industry for years, and I understand the trials and hard work that go into customer service. However, the staff at Nine Fine Irishmen is in some DIRE need of lessons in customer service. Have already been warning several of my Vegas-bound friends away from NYNY and all of the food establishments there!",

The food wasn't especially good, not awful, but just tasted a little off in one way or another. For the price, we all expected better. The bright spot was the colcannon soup which two people in our group got and loved. The \"Dubliner\" martini sounded interesting, but turned out to be a very run of the mill, too sweet appletini.  We were especially bitter when the bill came and included a 20% \"entertainment tax\" despite the fact that we were seated in the back and couldn't even see the band. We probably would have eaten elsewhere if we had known it would end up being so expensive.",

    "text": "Love this place! Went here last year and had to get back this time too! Great authentic Irish food. I had the lamb stew which is amazing, with Irish soda bread, and an order of sausages. Mmmmm... We were there for lunch and there was a great guitar player, playing both Irish classics and classic rock.  SO fun!! I had my first Guiness car bomb there! They also offered other great cocktails. There is a small gift shoppe in the front of the store where I got my Nine fine t shirt. The restaurant is located inside NYNY which is a very cute hotel. Being from Ny, some of the cuteness of the hotel is lost on me, coz Ive seen all that stuff a million times, here at home. But def worth a visit if you are not from here and would like to have a little sample of what the \"city\" looks like. Although its MUCH cleaner in NYNY.... Lol.",

I tried several things last night because we all like to share and each thing was delicious.  I had the ribeye which was great with a side of cream corn that made me want to lick the bowl.  My boss had the fish and chips - I can never eat another fish and chips again because this one was mind blowing.  The fish was perfectly fried and fresh - and it was huge.  My coworker had the shepherd pie - I took a huge spoonful and then longing stared as he finished it.  It was so creamy and good - and it's not usually my thing.  My coworker ordered the baked brie - love the combo of the baked brie with the balsamic sauce - it gave it a little extra something.  I left there unbelievable stuffed but so happy that I had found a new little delicious heaven.",

We were seated upstairs which would have been no big deal except we were the only ones sitting there with empty tables downstairs. No band playing as it was a weeknight but EXTREMELY  loud Irish music was playing non-stop on our floor with the second bar.  I can only guess it was so they could hear it downstairs but we literally could not hold a conversation at the table. After awhile I just wanted to flee the place as it gave me an actual headache by the time we left. We literally could not wait to leave....  Unfortunately, this also took much longer than we would have liked because the food service was painfully slow once our order was placed.  We received water which was never refilled and not another drop of anything liquid was offered after we declined cocktails initially. The food itself was good enough, unfortunately we were so uncomfortable due to the noise level it was hard to enjoy.  The food is why they got 3 stars.  Otherwise service=1, atmosphere=1.  Probably would be fine if you were a loud, boisterous drunk that was here to drink and have an appetizer only - if not, I would patronize somewhere else.....",

There were tender cubes of chicken, potatoes, carrots, and onions in a delicate, creamy sauce. It could have used a little salt. The Fish & Chips were very hearty large pieces of cod that was delicate to the fork yet held on to the crispy batter. The tartar sauce was unique in that it didn't resemble the Midwest white tartar sauce with bits of relish. This was a more creamy tartar sauce that was yellow in color, with a hint of lemon. Even though the fish was cooked perfectly, there was no seasoning and not even bathing it in tartar sauce could bring it to life.  The portions are enormous so if quantity over quality is your thing, you will be a happy diner.",

I already had high expectations before coming here, because of all the good reviews I've read, and from what I've been told from a couple of my friends.  I was advised to reserve a table in advance, and it is a good idea to do so, as this place can get pretty busy.   Atmosphere is loud and exciting virtually everywhere, but the quiet spots are relaxing and cozy. My family and I were lucky enough to get a table upstairs tucked in a corner for some quiet and privacy.   We started off with Irish Nachos with shredded corned beef. This alone, was worth the trip here. It was fricking good!!!  My sister and cousin had the shepherd's pie, and I had the ribeye with a side of herb rice. According to my sister and cousin, the shepherd's pie was to die for. The ribeye was cooked exactly how I asked, full of flavor, and was simple.   Since it was the day before my birthday, our waiter got me a shot of Jameson topped with whipped cream laced with Bailey's; or at least that's the best I could describe it, but I'm sure there's a proper name for it. Cool thing was, he told me it was on the house.   Good food that'll stick to you both literally and figuratively, and considering it's Vegas, their prices aren't too bad. I will definitely eat here again, the next time I'm in Vegas.",

Live entertainment is fun and the service is always top notch. Never tried any food so cannot comment there, I do like the self serve tap tables though!! If you're in NYNY then by all means stop in and have an overpriced beer, after all it is Vegas, and the BT's and servers will treat you right!!!",

    "text": "Love this place and can honestly say I've never had a bad meal here.  I come to Vegas about twice a year and always try new places to eat but this place is always my \"go to\" lunch/dinner at least once a trip.  I usually try to sit at the bar as I get my beers faster and the bartenders are always great.  A few of my menu favorites....the Shepard's Pie served in a big iron pail.....and the chicken pot pie served in the similar iron pail with all I can explain is like a giant pillow of pie crust on top.  Look at the pics people....its a massive, flaky piece of amazingness on top of the pail.  The live music is also a great touch.  I guess my only complaints are two things......they took way the gift shop here to put in more seating.  Shame because they had some really cool items to purchase.  Other complaint is really my fault as the food can really be filling as well as large portions and almost put you in food coma when it's time to hit the strip.  Nothing like finishing dinner at 10pm and debating just heading back to your room instead of going out.  :/",

Olivia Z. and I came to enjoy the band. It wasn't very busy, however, since there are only about 8 seats with a view the options are to stand & watch or find a table around the corner. We stood for awhile and then floated from table to table as better spots opened up. The upstairs was closed for a \"private event.\" The outdoor patio provides even more space.",

    "text": "I really enjoyed the atmosphere they were able to create, it's a very spacious 2 story Irish pub in the midst of the gaudy New York New York casino in Las Vegas.  Though it does seem somewhat artificial, like a corporate themed restaurant that hired customer insight specialists to put together what the mass consumer beer drinking target demographic would expect in an Irish themed bar, that doesn't mean it doesn't appeal to the average party of gastropub going fans.  Besides you're in Vegas, who goes to places to scrutinize every detail anyway?    I was seated upstairs in a semi-private table corner, as the bar was full and a local Irish 4 person band was playing to the delight of the crowd.  The hostess took me upstairs and pointed out the 9 busts of heads, who I think were the owners of the restaurant.  There was a whole description of them somewhere in the menu or on the side, but I didn't bother to read it.  They have an excellent selection of beer and cocktails, which would have been seriously disappointing if they didn't.    For the appetizers, they had a whole selection of standard gastropub food and then some.  If I lived here, I could see myself coming in and trying out their meat pies or sausages just as a meal in itself or as accompaniments to beer.  But since I wanted to try something different, I opted for the beer and cheese dip.  It was interesting, they serve it with different types of bread, which gives it a variety of textures.  The dip itself is a combination of 4 cheeses, which blended into a cheesy, salty range of flavors.  It was good, but after 3 or 4 bites I had enough.  Something about mixing that many cheeses together didn't sit well with me and I opted for munching on the breads sans cheese instead.  For the main dish I had the shepherd's pie, which is one of my favorite things to eat.  They make it ok here, the whipped potato on top was light and fluffy and the ground beef (which makes it cottage pie actually) underneath was flavorful and hearty.  I would definitely recommend the dish and one of their stouts to wash it down.  Looking at other tables, I want to come back and try their chicken pot pie.  Service was really good too.",

On our last visit, on 28 February 2017, we experienced a bill shock at the end of the meal.  We normally sit at the bar, but they had no seats this time, so we had a table.  We ordered two Bushmills on the rocks - as usual.  We have done this every time we have visited Nine Fine Irishmen.  So it looks like sitting at the bar is a better idea.  First, we were given rather meager pours.  Perhaps they were strict 45 ml pours.  So we ordered a total of 2 rounds, for 4 drinks in total.  When we received the check, there was a bill for 4 drinks at $14 each = $56 - the drinks were listed as \"Bushmills 10\" - I assume this is the Bushmills 10 year old that sells for $45 at BevMo.  As a result, what we were expecting to be well under $100 for a modest meal, came to $124 total.  This would never have happened had we sat at the bar.  A 750 ml bottle of Bushmills 10 year old is $45.  That holds 15 45 ml drinks.  First, they brought me the wrong drink.  We did not order Bushmills 10, we ordered Bushmills.  Second, they are charging a 4.67 times markup for a drink.    It is very unlikely we will be back.  It is even more unlikely that we will recommend to anyone.  BTW, since we live here, everyone asks us for recommendations.",

Now, he's been to the Guinness factory in Dublin where they actually teach you how to \"properly\" pour a Guinness and according to him Nine Fine knows how its supposed to be done!  Started with the fried pickles (I can't resist those little bastards anytime they are on the menu) which were very good & served with a dill based dipping sauce.  Also had the deep fried sausages. Deep fried sausages? That's almost like telling me there was deep fried bacon on the menu. They were also very good and were served with a spicy mustard sauce. YUM  We split the Chicken Pot Pie - because its HUGE and we had been eating all day for the past two days. BUT, it is big enough to split even if we hadn't been eating ourselves into oblivion. Warm flaky yet chewy crust that you can peel off each layer if you wanted. The sauce the chicken and veggies were swimming in was not your typical pot pie gravy. It was kind of pinkish orange and I wish I could duplicate it!",

I'm huge on black and tan combos and they had at least 6 or 7 from snakebites to half and halfs. I ordered the staple Irish meal, shepards pie...it was 20 bucks and I would say it's worth 7 or 8 max. Portion was a good size but after eating a legit Irish made shepards lie before it was no match. Plus they mounded probably a pound of cheese into it, way too much! Live music was fun but ten times louder than live music actually played in Ireland bars. Overall id give 3.5 since the beer was great.",

Located inside NY NY, this place serves breakfast, lunch, and dinner and has upstairs, downstairs, and patio bars.  I can't comment on what it's like late-night, but I hung out here with three other people in the early evening (5-7 or so) and it was very comfortable and relaxed.  When we sat down we were originally served by a bartender who was a total jackass, but the guy that took over the next shift was extremely friendly and efficient.    Someone else bought drinks so I can't comment on prices (I would assume they're not super-cheap but not ridiculous either) but the appetizers were in the $10-15 range and YUMMY!  At the second bartender's suggestion, the four of us shared the beer and cheese dip (which came with crackers and bread) and an order of fried sausages (which came with two different homemade mustards).  Both were yummy and perfect to go with the black-and-tans and shots of whiskey we ordered :)",

    "text": "I was seated on the patio for dinner and the atmosphere was great (until someone started smoking).  Inside seemed very cozy and sticks to the very homey pub theme.  It was very reminiscent of European architecture.  Starting with a wonderful Heritage Tomato salad with 4, very fresh, cheeses.  The baby heritage tomatoes actually had more flavor but with the cheese covered up some of the mealy taste of one of part of one of the heritage tomatoes.  After pointing this out, they brought me some more fresh slices.  This was followed by an extra large portion of Red Snapper that was expertly braised on one side and topped with (almost too many) capers and a buttery accent sauce.  I ordered, by recommendation, the Mac & Cheese.  Short of what I love from my home town (Charleston, SC), the Mac and Cheese was expertly baked with a wonderfully crispy topping and smooth, creamy sauce.  All meals are accompanied by what I'm sure they claim to be fresh raisin bread but it came across as a bit stale.  What was nice was the Irish butter in a pesto sauce to spread over the bread.  If the bread was warm it would have been much better.  I came back later, after walking off some of dinner, to one of the best bread puddings that has ever hit my tongue.  It arrived piping hot in a large cone shaped mug with two sauces on the side (one was some sort of whiskey sauce).  They proceeded to overturn the mug to empty out the succulent and buttery bread pudding onto the plate.  It seems that they may have intended one to dip the bread putting in each sauce with a spoon but given some of the other great bread puddings, in my experience, I proceeded to drizzle the sauces over the bread and dug in.  This was definitely not portioned for a single person or serving.  I would have been happy to pay the same price for more of a personally sized portion of each of the main course and the desert but it was definitely one of the best meals and deals that I've had on the strip.  I wish I could have stayed for some of the table dancing and band playing.  I am excited to visit there again and try something new the next time I'm in Vegas (though I probably won't deviate far from the pudding!).",

I was in Vegas on business staying at NY NY and had a limited time for lunch Tuesday Oct. 9. A co-worker and his wife had gone there for dinner the previous evening and had only great things to say about the food, music, and service. Even though I was only there for lunch, I became a believer!  The atmosphere is somewhat dark but somehow appropriate to the theme. My server was a round older lady with a smile that never ended, and a strong need to please. I ordered a Newcastle Ale and inquired about the Concannon soup. She congratulated me on the choice and tole me I wouldn't be disappointed and she was soooo right. A rich creamy soup made from potatoes, cabbage, and garnished with an incredibly lean and delightful smoked bacon. My co-workers had raved about the macaroni & cheese side dish. I love good mac & cheese so my curiousity go the best of me. This too was quite rich with a creamy full flavored cheese baked to a very hot and satisfying taste and texture. The couple sitting at the next table had ordered onion rings and I have to say they looked home made with a hand dipt golden batter.  My next trip to Vegas will find me enjoying a full dinner at this delightful watering and dining spot!",

Kelly was our awesome server! She gave us a sample of Smithwick's to try. My wife chose that one and I chose the Blacksmith. A 50/50 of Guinness and Smithwick's, I liked a lot!  At the suggestion of Kelly, we had the Steamers appetizer. YUM!  Probably the best little neck clams in white wine sauce, garlic and tomato broth served with Ciabatta bread we have had! Kelly even brought us some more bread so we could soak up the wonderful garlicky sauce. Def be back again!",

Very relaxed and casual, yet classy and upscale at the same time. Would be just as comfy sitting there in jeans and a t-shirt as you would be in a suit and tie. Server was phenomenal. Never kept us waiting for anything, was attentive without being overbearing, and made great conversation with us every time she came around. We loved her. Not that it matters, but the uniforms were really cute as well. For drinks, we both had Guinness. Perfectly poured, delicious, mouth watering Guinness. Their bartender has some skills, because it really was a beautiful pour. For food, hubby had the shepherd's pie, which looked amazing, and was served very creatively in a tin pot!  He absolutely raved about it. Said it was the best he ever had. I kept it simple with fish and chips, but let me tell you, there has never been a better fish and chips meal to ever cross my lips. Huge portions, and just so unbelievably delicious. Idk what they put in their breading, but sweet heaven, it was outstanding. I hate tartar sauce but I ate the crap out of theirs lol. It was crazy good. Next time we're in Vegas, definitely going back. Dinner and drinks for the two of us, including tip, was over 100$, so be prepared to spend a little money here, but it's oh so worth it.",

    "text": "My work mates organized a get-together here at Nine Fine Irishmen.  This looks like an Irish pub if the Irish pub originated in Vegas.  Not bad, just not going to be like your fave Irish dive that you frequent at home.  We had reservations and they marched us upstairs.  While there was plenty of room it was stone cold dead up there so seemed like we were in an empty restaurant.  Food that I tried: - beer and cheese dip: decadently cheesy with a bunch of breads to eat it with. Cheese was hard to just dip out, you have to use your fork or knife or risk stringing it all over the table.  It wasn't mind blowing but still pretty tasty. - chicken pot pie: creamy tomato broth was kind of what made it taste weird to me and the chicken was in perfect square chunks which made it seem like those frozen dinner chicken pot pies, but overall it was good.  The bread covering it was soft and pillowy and delicious. - Shepherd's pie: authentic Irish it isn't, but you are in Vegas so it is decent.  I'd pick the chicken pot pie over this though...beef seemed almost ground up rather than in chunks. - Creamed corn: home run side!  How can you not like corn that has been made extremely unhealthy by being creamed?    Service was efficient and, of course, helpfully upselling.  However, I like a double drink for not the full double price so I can dig it.  Cost is like everything else in Vegas - bit pricey but this place isn't going to break the bank.  Overall an A-OK joint.  Probably a better place to drink and get appetizers but still not bad for a full meal if you have people in your group that prefer a casual, more bar-like atmosphere.",

There are many private tables, a few booths, and some seating on the outside patio.  We didn't partake in the Irish food, only drinks. Pricing was typically high but the atmosphere was really fun!

I had been here a couple times the last couple years, and it has never disappointed me, though it has disappointed my dining companions several times.   Last night, I ordered the tomato salad as an entree, figuring I could sneak off some of the sides that the group was ordering. The tomatoes were perfectly ripe, and the blend of cheeses to accompany it were really surprising, but good. The sides are really where the place stands out for me--broccolini, tons of different mashed potatoes (goat cheese FTW) and my personal fave, mac and cheese.   However, my friends' steaks were not cooked to order. Some were too rare, another (a medium rare) was barely pink. I understand that with Friday night and a large party, getting everything out at the same time is a challenge, but a too-done steak, IMO, is probably the worst thing ever.   This place, like most of NYNY, doesn't exactly look like New York, but it's a nice simulation. Like another reviewer said, it's the dining gem of NYNY.",

They play traditional Irish music (which, surprisingly, is hard to find in many so called Irish pubs) as well as many rock cover songs. I've never seen anyone have a bad time listening to Ri Ra play and I've made many wonderful memories here thanks to them.

We used to have to seek out Irish festivals & fairs to hear live traditional Irish music, until we discovered The Nine Fine Irishmen pub & their epic house band Sin E Ri Ra! We heard their music pouring out of the pub one night as walked through the casino & decided to go check it out. We found our people!!  The atmosphere of the pub, with the band - Ri Ra - playing traditional Irish songs, made you feel like you just walked straight into a pub in Dublin. They played all the classics as well as many bar \"sing along\" favorites. We had the best time that night, and every time since! It never disappoints. I've yet to find a more authentic pub ANYWHERE outside of Ireland itself. And I have to say, the thing that sets this place apart from the many other Irish pubs out there, is Sin E Ri Ra. They attract such a friendly, fun loving, crowd that it's almost impossible not to have fun. Irish or not, if your looking for a night of unpretentious fun, where you can come as you are and kick up your heels whilst making at least 20 new best friends, go to the Nine Fine Irishmen pub and check out this band. (they go on at 9:00) It will be the funnest night of your trip!",

The abundance of Guinness and whiskey helps I'm sure. After being tossed out 4 or 5 years ago I ultimately apologized to the doorman and he's been more than kind in return.

We've tried several things, the lamb stew (yum, filling, big chunks of lamb), shepherds pie (good and filling), the spectacular chicken pot pie (everyone will ask you 'what is THAT?') and my new favorite the Guiness braised short ribs (SUPER tender, huge portion).  Only disappointment was a VERY small bacon wrapped meatloaf (about the size of a childs fist). Starters: baked brie, loved it, the crabcake we thought a bit expensive/small for one crab cake.  The beer selection appears spectacular (I dont drink, but the wife likes it!)  We play MyVegas and have used it to get buy-one, get-ones here a few times, great MLife benefit, make sure you tip on the original total!  Every one we've interacted with (front of house staff, waiters) has been wonderful.  Highly recommend for a fun, music filled dinner (or late night) - we even were able to dine here after the early Zumanity show (I think they stop dinner service @ 11).",

This gave us little more than an hour for dinner, so we headed to Nine Fine Irishmen just so we can sit outside, away from the smokey casino.   I had no expectation, especially since the servers were nonchalant (nicely putting it) and didn't really care to take our order, clean the table, and even complained that the heater might not work when it turned on just fine. Because all 3 servers were like that, and weren't around much, one less star.   As for the food, it was better than I thought! -Steamed mussels - flavorful and not salty; I actually enjoyed the broth quite a bit -Pork chop - big portion; pork chop was juicy and flavorful -Beer - yum!  I probably won't return, as there are clearly so many restaurant options in Vegas, but it is an A-ok place.",

It's not too close to the outdoor music which is good because it's not super loud. The cheese dip starter is delicious, I only wish they had better bread to go with it. The bread was a little tough and seemed stale. The shepherds pie lacked much flavor, I'm guessing due to low quality of meat or lack of seasoning. If I went back I would just get snacks and drinks to enjoy the venue and skip the food.",

We arrived at about 1030ish and found seating upstairs. We asked the bartender upstairs if they had a good menu and told us they stopped serving food but we could see the waitress running food. We went downstairs to ask the host and he sent us to ask the waitress. We asked the waitress and she told us to ask the host. It was a mess. We finally sit at a table downstairs to try it and the same waitress comes up to take our order but man did she have attitude!  I sympathized with her b/c she was the only one serving but it's not really our fault. Anyway, she comes and sets the check on a chair instead of the table. (?) The attitude continued throughout the night. I just paid and took the food upstairs with my friends. We got Irish nachos and they were not what I expected. They are chips with a bunch of sauces on top. It looks like cheese sauce and some other green sauce. Not good at all.   Really bummed but at least I tried it and dont have to come back lol I wouldn't recommend anyone come here. Shoot for the real thing in Ireland! Lol",

It was kind of quiet during the time we went, but the bartender let us know that it gets fun at night time.  We had a few drinks, most of which had Jameson of course.

We were seated upstairs for dinner.  Seating was a little on the uncomfortable side though in high back very upright/straight wooden chairs.  Disappointed that there was no bread served for the dinner.  I ordered a wedge salad with salmon - which hit the spot for me.

    "text": "My friend and I decided to stop by here before heading home to California after being recommended by our server at gordon ramsay's pub and grill the night prior.  I have a couple things to say about the place, the food, and service.   1.) Location and Decor .  This little pub is located in new York new York, close to The Park, the fake Brooklyn Bridge,  and a number of other shops (stupidiotic, shake shack). I personally thought the decor was adorable, it really contributed to the atmosphere. Outdoor patio area is really nice and gives you a nice view of the strip. The sprinklers keep you from overheating on those warm vegas days  2.) Food Everything we ate at this place was absolutely wonderful. My drunken peach cocktail was great - not too strong on the slcohol, but just the right amount. We started with the beer and cheese dip - tasted amazing and the bread slices and sticks that came with it were yummy and  perfectly soft/crunchy. My friend had corned beef, which he said was really good (and he is very hard to please food-wise). I had turkey panini, which although plain looking, was very flavorful and tasty. And then we had the chocolate cake for dessert. I've cream on top of it was creamy. Cake was soft and moist. Beer, chocolate, and ice cream came together perfectly to create a flavorful masterpiece in that cake   3.) Service Our server (Dillon 09 was on his jersey, but i don't recsll his name) was very friendly. He gave us the time we needed to order and was always checking on us to make sure we were doing well. Sladjan, was, of course, amazing as usual as well. He delivered our food quickly and always made sure to check that my friend and I were doing well and were happy and comfortable. He even entertained us with more stories and jokes. His laugh, smile and service was great.  I'll definitely come back next time I'm in Vegas - what's not to love about the good food, location, and great service? Thank you nine fine irishmen for a wonderful experience",

    "text": "Through our vegas rewards we had a $25 credit to try this place out.  The service gets 2 stars and the food was close to a 4 so the average was a 3.   After being seated by an other than friendly host, we sat for a little over 5 mins before being greeted by our waiter. He did not seem happy he was working and was not trying to fake the funk either. It wasn't that we did not come by enough(which he didn't), it was the fact that we he did come by it felt like we were interrupting him. Maybe he was having an off night but from the other reviews, they need to work in customer service.   My wife and I shared the buffalo wings which I thought were awesome. Then we split the fish and chips for our meal. I really enjoyed the fish with the tarter sauce. The fries were a little over cooked, so we did not finish them.   If you can get past the spotty service you might be able to try some tasty food.",

    "text": "We went to Nine Fine twice this trip and experienced two different atmospheres.    Our first trip there was for lunch during a FIFA match (Bavaria/ Korea).  They did have minimum purchase requirements for seating which is understandable for a big sporting event.  The service was prompt and left us alone to watch the game.  My wife had the fish and chips which was fantastic.  The fish was thick filets and perfectly cooked.  I ordered the Shepherd's Pie and I'm hooked.  I'm no shepherd's pie expert, but it was a fantastic dish.  We went back the next night just for a drink.  We didn't expect more than the ambience that we experienced during the FIFA match and we were wrong.  Ri Ra, what I gathered was band that plays there regularly, was playing and they were quite good.  We stayed and had a few pints (I recommend the Black Smith), watched the Irish dancing and listened to the band.  The atmosphere was great and the service was excellent.  Even though the bar was busy, the server's were spot on and never seemed rushed.  All-in-all, a great experience.",

    "text": "Excellent meal, great service, and very welcoming.  My wife and I were staying at NYNY and decided to have lunch here.  We found a coupon in one of the Vegas magazines for a free appetizer with the purchase of two meals.  We started with the Beer N' Cheese dip.  The dip comes with a few stick-type breadsticks, sliced fresh bread, and wheat crackers.  The dip was very cheesy and tasted like real cheese.  It was a little awkward to scoop the dip since it was so thick, but it was still a good choice.  For our meals, we had the Sloppy Pat and the Chicken and Brie Cheese Sandwich.  Both were great, I especially loved the chicken sandwich.  Both meals were served with steak fries (chips for you Irish folk)  They were very crisp on the outside and soft on the inside.  We ate them in traditional fashon with vinegar rather than catsup.    We also had a few New Castles and a Harp.  Both were nice and cold and tasted great.  Overall, the $60-ish we spent on our meal and drinks were a pretty darn good deal in my opinion (we had spent $18 on two hotdog meals the prior day on the casino floor)  Great alternative to a buffet, food is much better quality and left me as much, if not more satisfied.",

    "text": "Granted, this might not be the most Irish of all Irish pubs, being tucked away in the New York New York Hotel/Casino in Vegas. But it's a damn good time regardless.  I went here with my BF because we both love Irish bars, and we happened to have the BEST time ever at this particular watering hole. There were 3 Irishmen at the bar from Canada, and an Irishman from New York city with his Jersey girlfriend -- our whole time there was a combination of dancing, singing Irish songs (dirty old townnnnn....), laughing, biting (the good kind, but even the bad kind is the good kind), singing pop songs (loudly), and of course, lots of Irish whiskey (Jameson) and beer (Smithwicks - for you beer dunces out there, the \"w\" is silent). It's the most drunk I've ever gotten without throwing up. That's a personal record I would write in my diary if I had one. I'd probably even stick a Hello Kitty twin star sticker next it and everything.  The bartender was heavy handed and fun and I think he even shaved that day. He even resembled Colin Farrel a bit; but maybe that's just because I was watching Colin's porn clip on the web just an hour earlier (5 stars for his performance, FYI). The crowd was definitely lively; how much of that was attributed to the fact that you're on vacation and you're supposed to be lively on vacation, I'm not sure. A guitarist took the stage and sang a variety of songs, which of course, we all slaughtered along to ourselves. He totally humored us and was a champ about all our heckling. I'm sure he talked shit about us after his shift, but he sure acted like he wasn't going to.  It truly was one of the funnest times I've ever had at a bar. We didn't try the food, so I can't vouch for that, but the crowd and the staff -- five stars all the way.  I will definitely be coming back here my next Vegas round. The Irish really know how to throw down. Just ask Colin.",

I was hoping for boxty, and blood sausage but they did not have it. They also did not have black and white on the menu. None the less, the food was not a disappointment. The Guinness I ordered was ice cold and had the perfect head to it, served in a nice pint glass. The hostess from Brooklyn was amazing and very friendly, and was fun to talk with. This place is first on my dinner list for my next visit. They had footy on for us to watch, and the tables were very clean. I high recommend stopping by.

The host greeted us and went to arrange a table for our large group on the patio. We waited approximately 10 minutes - no big deal. We were seated and had our drink order taken within a decent amount of time - however it took 20 minutes for our drinks to arrive (beers/mixed drinks - no fancy cocktails). Dinner took over an hour, and during this time our waitress only came to the table once for another drink order - if you know dinner is going to take a while, it would be nice to be told and offer to take more drink orders (not to do a disappearing act!) The grand finale was when our bill came. Due to the fact there were over 6 or 8 ppl in our party, there was an automatic gratuity added on, which the waitress failed to mention. We had guests in our party from all over the world, New Zealand included, where tipping is not standard practice. So to have the tip automatically included and then a tip prompt on the bill as well, was pretty shady. When our concern was mentioned, as the figures did not match up, the waitress was pretty rude and then was speaking poorly of our group to a fellow waitress - as we could overhear them. This was our first night in Vegas, and to have this type of service was certainly a disappointment. I will 100% never go back, and will advise others the same!! If I could give this half a star, I would!!",

They're trying to be your local Irish pub, if you were in Ireland, but the colors are rich, the lighting pretty, and easy on the eyes, but not flashy at all.  Seating was easy to get and the place wasn't crowded.  And that's about it.  Maybe it's because I had high expectations, but I was disappointed when I visited Nine Fine Irishmen.  I just loved saying the name with an Irish brogue and I expected there to be people dancing a jig and entertainers reciting reels or something.  We must have come at the wrong time, because that didn't happen.    The marketing machine for this restaurant did an excellent job of selling this place, what with the \"authentic Irish pub, dismantled piece by piece and reassembled at the spectacular New York New York casino\" crap.  I just kept thinking, \"Who are the Nine Fine Irishmen?\"  I checked the website, which describes each of the irishmen and makes them out to be freedom fighters.  I kept thinking, \"Does that mean they're terrorists?\"  I was willing to forgive them if the food was good.  It was subpar.  I was hoping the shepherd pie would be hearty and intense with flavor.  It was bland.  My friend ordered the sausage pail, which is sausage served with whole mustard.  It tasted like sausage with whole mustard.  The beer made it go down well, but that doesn't change the fact that it was just sausage and mustard- nothing special.    I was going to try dessert, but since we were so disappointed with our entrees, we didn't see the point.",

It has that standard pub look to it, and it seems roomier inside than from what you see in the front. The live band always plays great covers. I know I've sang along to some Oasis and U2 there. And I always leave this bar satisfied and really drunk.   A good tip that one of the waitresses told us was that when you're at the outside patio and get your drinks served there, you don't have to pay the entertainment tax.",

    "text": "This is definitely one of the coolest looking places and more fun bars I've ever been to. First off, I love Irish bars. That culture has a really fun attitude about boozing, and some of the best drinks in the world. Whisky, beer and Irish cream, awesome. Second, this place has great food. It's rare to find an awesome bar, that also has awesome food. Usually I can either a) tolerate the food or b) drink enough crappy beer to not care how bad the booze is, even though the food rocks. I really love the second level of this bar. It's a huge high ceiling-ed place with dark, rich wood bars and cozy lighting. They pump Irish music in (not too loud) to add to it. There's lots of Irish decor and pictures as well.   This place recently fell from 5 to 4 stars in my book for several reasons.   1. They do a lot of private parties here. You may be turned away every night of your stay. 2. Prices seem significantly higher. $10 for a pint of Guinness, and it's (probably) neither an imperial or even full pint. 3. Food seems to be out of stock a lot. Certainly dishes were out of stock several times. 4. Service. We used to LOVE the bartenders here (especially Dave, the Mexican guy and the guy who served us \"shaleighleighs.\" Since then, the staff is almost indignant and sometimes approaching rude. 5. I HATE to say it, but I definitely got food poisoning here once (it was the only place I had eaten in 24 hours, so I know it was them.) It wouldn't stop me from returning or recommending this place, but it's my first thought when we enter here. 6. Crowded. Sometimes it's impossible to get in.  More on the good (I feel like I left too many negatives.) Food is great here. Everything I've had was top notch. The sausage pail is one of my favorites. It's small, deep fried sausages in a little 'bucket.' They are super tender and juicy. It's a meal for two. They also have Guinness pies, which kinda like empanadas or similar. Very good, but kinda skimpy. The baked brie is good, but also a little skimpy. I like the crab dip a lot. It was very flavorful and fresh. They have a huge selection of whiskies and mixed drinks here. They actually have some interesting concoctions on their menu. They also serve several Irish beers and of course, Guinness. I highly recommend this place, with a bit of caution towards being able to even get in. Pretty much, if you can get in, I'd do it. But I wouldn't go way out of my way to do so, anymore. I really wish it was still a 5 star, but it's hard to say I love a place where the service has failed recently, and I can't even get into! Anyway, enjoy it, if you can. Slainte!",

When we approached the podium the servers seemed confused, which I cannot find any reason for, you work at a restaurant we want to sit down....what's the mystery? They got it all worked out an sat us. There were bread plates on the table but no bread ever made it to us. Chris ordered the Lamb Stew. The broth/stock was excellent. The concept was good-clean simple flavors- but the execution was a miss for us. The lamb, carrots and potatoes were cut in chunks way WAY to big to fit on the spoon or eat in one bite. It is inconvenient to have to cut something in or bite into something from a soup. I ordered the salmon salad with the dressing on the side, but some other salad with pickles and chicken came out with the dressing on it. I didn't want to send it back so I just ate it. The dressing was light and tangy. It was a little too sour with the pickles. Actually the pickles in the salad were not good all together. We will be back this summer, staying in the Venetian and Nine Fine Irishmen will not be on our check list.",

    "text": "this was a really memorable experience!!! i love love love Irish and British food....(i may be the only one), so i was psyched to get a big Irish breakfast at 3 in the afternoon!  We drank a lot before we decided to order lunch. We were munching fried sausages and drinking beer after beer for about an hour. Then I got really really hungry. Don't ask me how, beer usually fills me up. Maybe it was all the smells wafting through the room.  Hello Irish breakfast. Eggs over medium cooked in butter with Irish bacon which is closer to ham. Small medallions of meaty bacon....really salty and really really good. Bangers, of course....because I hadn't scarfed enough yet.....grilled think tomato slices and...wait....no heinz beans? awwww.... it also comes with mushrooms, which i am allergic to and black & white puddings (blood sausage).....which are nasty.  We went back on Monday (we were in Vegas Thurs-Wed) night so they had a live rock band, which was really funny. I begged them to sing Molly Malone after my 4th Guinness, and they happily obliged.....I may have told them it was my birthday.....but whatever. That night I was adventurous and tried the lamb with curry. I really do not like the gamey taste of lamb, but it was tender and the curry sauce was creamy and good. I ended up switching plates with my boyfriend who ordered a NY steak with blue cheese that was TO DIE FOR. The other two in our party ordered Shepherds Pie, which I was told was just ok, and salmon with maple.....I hate salmon and could smell only his dish all night......until i drank enough Guinness not to care.",

    "text": "\"Mc Intires!!!\"   If Disneyland and some podunk Dublin pub had a love child, it would be \"Nine Fine Irishmen\"   I've never been to Ireland. The closest thing I've been to Ireland (or might ever be) was a hazy, boozy, nebulous Saturday / early Sunday that ended at this faker than fake Irish bar, inside the fake NY - Greenwich Village-esque part of NY-NY in Vegas.   The night went as your average, nonsense Sodom and Gomorrah , we are all going to die in a fiery wrath of Godly fireball, Vegas night. We hopped around from the Hard Rock , over to the grotto at the Wynn. Finally, one of my friends says \"hey, let's go over to New York , New York\"....It's one of my least favorite casinos in Vegas because knowing New York fairly well, it just seems cheesy.   So against my better wishes, this horde of liquored up stooges I call friends of mine make it to New York New York and try and go to \"Bar at Times square\". You know the one where you inevitably sing along to Wal-Mart renditions of Billy Joel and Elton John songs. That place was packed.   We walk around the urea a bit and stumble into \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" Well jumping Jehoshaphat! The decor was a mix of Vegas excess mixed with every two bit pub, dive and European styled watering hole you've ever been in. It was packed, loud and cracking' There was a live band eponomously named \"The McIntires\" and as far as I could tell, they were in fact Irish. Besides them and maybe the Guinness on tap being served there, they were the only True Irish element inside the \"pub\".   You know what, it didn't matter. They were playing rockous, Pogues inspired Irish Rock complete with Riverdancers. Chants of \"when I say you, you yell Mc Intires!!\" left my throat raw. We pounded about 3 pints of warm Guinness and for a minute, I actually believed I was in Lord of The Rings at the \"Prancing Pony\". The spell worked so well that I hardly noticed when about six or seven guys staged a faux Irish pub fight. How do I know it was fake and there to add to the realism of the joint? Well, they all of a sudden started \"fighting\" for no apparent reason to me (I was next to them) but not a single guy threw or landed a single punch. It looked like a standard playground fight when I was 5 years old.   The night ended with all of us beginning to speak Gaelic sprinkled with gibberish. Though the bathrooms were clean nobody cried, I still could have sworn I was in Ireland.   Be sure to catch the nightly staged midnight rabble.   Slaunte!",

NFI is great because it is huge, has outdoor areas to escape the noise, tons of seating and an incredible band playing live music for hours 6 days out of the week.  I recommend going to listen to Ri Ra, the house band if you haven't done so already.  They play great folksy Irish songs and drinking songs that make even the most Mexican guy (me) feel Irish.  If you're not into clubs or just looking for a change, check out NFI.  Put down a couple pints, request \"7 Drunken Nights\", sing along, and be merry.",

Their steaks are delicious and juicy and they have probably the best bread pudding I have ever had.  Not to mention the amazing live music that starts at 9pm! Definitely not your typical, on the strip, restaurant. The place is lively, dim-lit, and I always see people having a good time when they are here. I make it a point to go here every time i'm in Vegas.  If you pick a seat with a view of the balcony and the stage, you'll be set for some good ol' fashioned Irish folk dancing and tunes by the Nine Fine Irishmen (Yes, this place is named after the amazing band that plays here)   Overall: Great environment, happy times and great food!

The staff was friendly and everyone was having such a great time.  They have a fantastic beer selection and again 16 year old bushmills.  Yeah!!!  The best selling point though is their house band.  OH MY GOD!!  One of the best irish bands I've ever heard.  They get the audience off their asses and on the floor.  I even saw an 80 year old lady dancing.  I will definitely be back the next time I'm in Vegas.",

It is her favorite restaurant and we have enjoyed the food every time we have been there, until last night. The food was less than stellar, especially the Shepherd's pie which was dry and cold. Some gravy or sauce would have been nice, but by the time our server suggested and brought it, the food only got colder. Aside from the food, the service was horrible.  It would have been nice to let the server know about the poor quality of food, but he was nowhere to be found.   In the future, we will definitely re-think our choices when going to Vegas. There are so many great restaurants, this WAS one of them, but like everything, it changed for the worst.  Its too bad.  The atmosphere and decor of this place is outstanding.  Too bad the food and service are not.",

While day-gambling, we stumbled across Nine Fine, and decided to head on in.  I'm glad we did.  We had a couple beers, the salmon salad and the goat cheese salad.  Both were really really good.  Not what you would expect from an Irish bar.  And they are proud supporters of St. Balderick's, which I thought was great.  They even support staff members shaving their heads for the cause! Cure kids cancer! I think we can all agree on that! (Okay, did not see the review going there...)",

    "text": "Sorry Nine Fine, $7.50 for a Newcastle is a mugging and won't get you beyond two stars.  Nine Fine Irishmen is located inside the New York, New York casino.  It's more than just an Irish pub.  The ornate decor and split level venue make it seem a little more classy than a hole in the wall.  But I have serious gripes with this place.  The crowd: You are guaranteed to come across packs of oblivious tourists.  It starts as you wait to get in and only gets worse the deeper you get inside.  These are the folks who just stand in the middle of the room staring at the wall while you try to weave your way through.  They're inescapable.  The booze:  8 bucks for a Guinness and $7.50 for a Newcastle is about as expensive as it gets on the strip.  And when it's served in a clear college style plastic cup half the time, good luck expecting any kind of tip from me.  There are a few bright spots.  The venue itself seems very authentic.  And on many nights you'll have live Irish music which is certainly better than another dj playing Boom Boom Pow every 20 minutes.  But hey if that's your cup of the just go out to the patio seating and you'll hear the music bleeding over from Rok next door.  If you have money to burn I would go to Nine Fine during the day if you feel you must experience it, otherwise it's not worth it.",

There are lots of other places on the strip to go to. I had the lamb stew which was good but not worth the price. My husband had the bangers and mash which was good but very salty, and he really did not like the cabbage. Our companion had the shepherd's pie which was pretty standard.

But on our last trip, those of us that were left on Sunday afternoon were bored and could use a place just to sit and have a few beers...like we do everywhere else but Vegas.  A sign in the men's room claims that the bar was built in Dublin and transported piece by piece.  I'm not sure if I buy that, but it is comfortingly authentic in that Americanized, idealized way.  Everything's a little too perfect, but I'll take it.  Dark wood, cozy nooks, wistful signage evoking the old country...it's all there.    Beer selection could be better, but of course they have Guinness, Smithwick's, Harp, and Magner's.  I tried Murphy's Red for the first time (B+) but would have preferred Murphy's Stout.  Pints are $7, which on the one hand is highway robbery, but on the other seems in line with Strip pricing.  All in all, a great place to park your caboose to take a rest from the sights and sounds of Las Vegas, especially in the afternoon when it isn't crowded.    Incidentally, check out their website for a lengthy and respectable (for a bar site) history of the Young Irelander movement and the nine eponymous patriots.",

The pub itself is beautiful, designed by The Irish Pub Company who design, manufacture, and install authentic Irish Pubs globally. The staff is extremely playful, which helps after you just lost some cash at the tables. There is a small stage for a band but we ended up leaving just before they played. Apparently they sing old and new Irish folk songs and cover almost anything you ask them to. I didn't have a chance to really look at their menu but I did see that they had a traditional Irish breakfast complete with bangers and the ever so nasty white and black pudding (I won't even eat that in Ireland!!).

The food was great and thought the atmosphere was cool and a good attempt at an Irish Pub. Have some great Irish beers on tap and loved my Black and Tan. Had the Shepard's Pie and the Colcannon Soup which were so darn yummy! The server we had our first night was awesome and made for a great experience. The second visit was our last night in town. This is where we go from a 5 star experience to a 4 to 3.5 star experience. As we all had a late lunch and needed to do an early dinner due to a crack of dawn flight back home, we all ordered the yummy soup and really were not drinking. Server was a young blonde woman who was somewhat attentive and explained the special. However, we sat and chatted for a bit after paying the check, and the server kept walking past the table, which was in the back separated from the rest of the other tables and really gave us a bad vibe. While I guess her tip was not that great due to the overall food bill or maybe they just wanted to turn the table, but the vibe was not necessary. Would recommend if you're in Vegas looking for a good place to eat. Just don't linger too long and chat!!",

Once seats opened up at the bar we had great service. I guess it's lucky for them that we've had such a good experience from multiple visits in the past that we even stuck around!!",

No bar stools were at the bar either. Like none. We weren't offered the option of getting a drink even. So we stood in a corner til we decided to vacate after just one song. The band was good but the establishment was not.",

    "text": "My family and I had a fantastic time at the nine fine Irishmen! The decor inside is awesome, and we went for the live music at 9:00PM.   My girlfriends father loves live music, particularly live irish music, and this place did not disappoint. The band and the step dancer were both wonderful! We loved listening to them play and enjoying the atmosphere.   The food we got was also very good, albeit expensive. However, it's the strip, so I wasn't overly surprised. I tasted the bangers and mash, the fish and chips, and the shepards pie. I LOVED my shepards pie, and the bangers and mash were really good too. The fish and chips were above average, but not amazing.   We also got irish nachos with the corned beef on it to start. It was good, but at like 16 bucks, I expected more.   The beer was also reasonably priced at 7.50 for a pint of Guinness (or anything else). We enjoyed quite a bit of beer!  There are few places that make me feel I am getting My value for what I'm getting at strip prices, but I enjoyed myself so much with the music and beer I found myself thinking how worth it this was! If I'm looking to spend more money than usual, but have some good food, GREAT beer, and listen to live music... I'll most likely do it here.   One thing I disliked was the entertainment tax... Never saw that before, and it added a chunk into the bill. I'm glad they get money from it, it's a smart idea, but I wasn't prepared for that!",

However, the on-site manager spent the time talking to my wife and I about what our problems were (see below), then went into the kitchen, talked with the staff and came back and reported her findings (new line chef).  THEN we received an email the next day from the manager saying how she was going to deal with training and that she thanked us for our feedback.  She turned a poor experience into a place we're happy to give a second try.  We did pay for the dinners, our goal was not a free meal, which may have impacted her willingness to figure out the issues we found.  In any case, she gets lots of credit for her actions.  Our issue was with the food.  My wife ordered the fish and chips - oily and 2 sad, small pieces.  They did take it back and give her the baked brie in its place as she ask - not baked enough to be eaten smeared onto the toasties.  She ended up not eating.  I ordered the meatloaf which I don't see on the menu so it might have been a special.  Nice serving size, looked great.  It was very dry :( their solution was to offer more of the (actually very tasty) sauce to pour over it but I declined.  We sat outside and thanks to the misters, the temp was nice and the dude playing music down the walk was great.",

Fours stars due to the prompt service and decent food.",

I was expecting regular bar food, but it was actually quite upscale without being stuffy. I had the tomato salad, crabcakes, and baked brie. Everything was delicious. My black and blue was good. Shandy was a little sweet, I would probably pass on that next time.   Prices were quite reasonable for the strip. Would come here again.",

We were seated right away and since we had never dined here before they gave us a great table on the second floor over looking the restaurant and bar. It's decorated beautifully and really holds its own as an Irish pub.  I was impressed with all of the police and fire badges that were hanging in the bar on the second floor. It really added to the ambiance to the entire restaurant. Our waiter took our drink order right away and the menu was easy to follow. We had the salmon and Guinness short rib for dinner with fries and brussel sprouts. The short rib came out under temperature, but they fixed it with a new hot dish.  I'd definitely like to try this place again. They have a huge party on St. Patrick's day inside the restaurant and even outside.",

The Irish burger was to have carmelized onions on it.  They were, for lack of a better word, coarsely chopped, and still white and crunchy instead of golden brown and tender.  The shepherd's pie was good and filling but there was chunky meat as well and ground meat on it.  The stew was good, but there was \"something\" in it and the shepherds pie that irritated all three diners' lower lips.  Not really sure if it was a spice or what, but strange how all had the same reaction.   The fourth diner with us thoroughly enjoyed the Irish breakfast saying everything was delicious.  It was the first time they had eaten bangers and they thought they were very good.  The Irish coffee was superb!",

We made a reservation through Open Table and got a spot right in front of the stage.  Funnel Sticks, Beer, and the Irish Fiddle filled my evening.  The sticks I'm referring to are a desert on their menu.  Like funnel cake, but in stick form; easy to dip in the three sauces they provide, strawberry, chocolate, and caramel.  Just like at the fair, but bring friends, caus they give you a lot.  I dream of the day I have enough friends in Vegas at one time to get the Tap Table.  It's the bigger, standing table, as you enter that has it's own tap and counter to see what you're consuming.  Kind of a gimmick, but I love gimmicks!  I'll be back Nine Fine, I'll be back...",

First off, we use the game MyVegas to earn loyalty points that translate to free stuff in Vegas.  You can get it through Facebook.  We got a voucher for $25 to use at NFI.  We told the server beforehand and she was nonchalant about it.   We ordered a beer and a hard cider and some appetizers.  We got the cheese dip and hot wings.  The hot wings were hot wings - perfect size, just the right amount of hot.  if you want traditional hot wings, you can get them here. The cheese dip was the stuff of dreams.  It wasn't complicated, melted cheese with various types of bread.  I love bread and I love cheese.  I love various types of bread and I love melty cheese.  I was angry Yes ANGRY, that I had to share with my husband and you could tell he felt the same way, we were feverishly trying to beat each other out to get more of the cheese dip.  Next time, I will just order my own.  I should have that night, I have no idea why I didn't. There was a live band and we were sat around the corner, in view of the dancing platform at a table that had a loveseat on one side.  It was an intimate little corner away from the drunken masses.  The music was good. There was a dancer who came out here and there to do some Irish dancing on the platform.  She was good too.  Definitely a cool place to have a couple of drinks and a boatload of cheese. We ended up ordering a couple more drinks and the whole bill was the $25 voucher plus maybe $15 more.  Awesome value. I'm adding this to my list of must go to's in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wandered into Nine Fine Irishmen looking for some good pub food before a show and sadly couldn't find it. The beer and cheese dip with bread was acceptable, but quickly became inedible as it cooled - there has to be a better way. Ordered lamb stew (thin and flavorless) and bangors and mash which came with fresh cabbage (weird texture to add) and an acidic gravy which added nothing. Sausage was good, but the rest ruined it. Wish we had skipped this one. One positive note - the decor was fabulous - loved the upstairs booth we were placed in - very private.",

Add a dash of good live entertainment playing Irish classics.  Then add copious amounts of Irish whiskey and voila! You have a little piece of heaven.    Having men in full military dress helps, too :)",

Beer and whisky selection was great, service was very good but the shepherds pie, potato soup and fish and chips were all just ok. The best thing on the menu is their Irish take on tiramisu which was to die for!!! Overall, I would skip it for food and just go for the live band, music and drinks at night.",

    "text": "The last morning of our annual Vegas trip (actually, it was almost noon by the time we checked out), we walked around New York New York with a hankering for breakfast.  And beer... we also thought of beer.  Nine Fine Irishmen!  The dimly lit interior was a little off-putting when we knew it was bright mid-day outside, but the faux-\"countryside\" Irish pub decor was charming, the hostesses and wait-staff very friendly, and the menu intriguing. We were seated in a cozy corner booth and eagerly waited upon. We started \"breakfast\" with two beers, \"we have to\" Sarah insisted; a Guinness over Magners for her, a Boddington pub ale for me.  Sarah ordered the [starter] Guinness braised beef and mushroom pies w/ tomato relish and chive dressing and [breakfast] stack of pancakes with strawberries. I got the [traditions] Irish breakfast of two eggs, rashers of bacon, bangers, black & white puddings, roasted tomato and sauteed mushrooms. Great service - I didn't know what black and white puddings were and inquired; the server said \"blood sausage\" in a delicate manner, commenting that the name dissuades some people from trying it. Glancing over at Sarah, we cheer \"It sounds good! We're all about that!\"  While you wait, they bring out a big overflowing basket of crusty bread and big triangular wedges of butter. One could get full on that alone.  By Sarah's estimation, the meat pies, after some giggling ponderance, tastes like (and this is not a knock, more like pleasantly reminiscent of) McD's cheeseburgers! The fried pastry shell, tender meaty filling, the tomato relish, the chive dressing... it comes together like a cheeseburger with ketchup and pickles!  The stack of pancakes with strawberry compote and whipped cream was an eyeful. The cakes themselves were large and fluffy, griddled to a crispy exterior. The strawberry compote wasn't overly sweet or syrupy, retaining a tangy snap of fresh fruit. Add a big dollop of whipped cream and there was little need for syrup at all.  My Irish breakfast plate was simple and straightforward. A couple of cooked-to-order eggs, strips of bacon, serving of rashers (like corned beef hash?), a sausage, the black and white puddings (a dark and a light blood sausage), and a whole roasted tomato. Clean and comforting breakfast staples. With the pint of Bodington and a slice or two of buttered bread, its a hearty meal, perfect for those hazy hungover mornings.  A good find to mark the end a good time. A fun restaurant in one of my fave hotels. I'll definitely be coming back here again. _______________________________________ Sarah out-drank me two pints to one at breakfast!! Ah, Vegas! All about beating the odds!",

It was all delicious!!!  We had a jolly good time with our bartender who was so nice to take pictures for us, keep our glasses full, and provide some good conversation.

Bartenders were friendly and good with service, beers were reasonably priced for Vegas, and the atmosphere was very social.  They have TVs to watch various games, it's a comfortable atmosphere, and the beer/cheese dip appetizer I had was surprisingly delicious.  I'm from Wisconsin and when you're from there you know your cheese but this stuff was REALLY good.  We also were just in the mood for a snack and it turned out to be plenty filling.  When you're down there anyway spending gobs of money on all sorts of entertainment, this place is a pretty good stop for slowdown in the action.  Good down to earth feel; highly recommend.  I normally reserve my five-star reviews for something spectacular but between all the bars/clubs I've been to in Vegas including other Irish bars this restaurant actually made me feel better than most so I have to give it some props.",

Out of our orders the pot pie had a good review along with the fish and chips. They were both very good. The lamb that I had ordered medium rare came well done. The tomato salad my wife ordered came soggy and she was disappointed. The shrimp were over done along with the asparagus.

The atmosphere was wonderful, the music was perfect (just wish there were fewer breaks between songs!), the food was delicious, presentation was exquisite... and to top it off- our waiter was irish with an irish accent!  It just put the experience over the top for us. NFI will definitely be a tradition every time we head out to vegas.  It was the highlight of my trip.  ASK FOR CORY AS YOUR SERVER!  Portions are huge!  Suggestions on the menu: Mac and cheese as a side was good if you like cheesy Shepard's pie was excellent Chicken pot pie was very creamy Pork porterhouse was sweat and very flavorful Fish and chips were excellent Fried sausages were very good",

Drinks are flowing and the Irish music is blaring. They even have an Irish dancer. The band even had a groupie, the last time we went. This is a real Irish Pub. I never ate here but I am sure the food is good. But if you are in the mood to have a great time and drink, this is definitely the place to be. Visit on a Friday or Saturday night and go early as the place is a wee bit small and it gets crowded. Park yourself next to the bar and start pounding the drinks. AWESOME!!!",

I'm glad that we listened, because it was the last bar we needed to go to before the end of our trip.   We started out with a appetizer, which just so happened to be 'Irish Nachos'.   Potato slices baked and then cheese, onions, and other goodies that made you think you were eating a giant potato skin platter.  Our main courses came in, and we had both gotten Filet Mignon. It was cooked perfectly bloody pink for our likings.   The garlic mashed potatos and green beans complimented the main course perfectly.   By looking at it all, you would first think that there might not be enough food for a hungry person, but there was more than enough... I ended up sending much of it back when I just couldn't eat any more.    We paid our bill and then headed to the bar.   We had a couple of Irish Carbombs, and then finished off the night having a few Guinness.  The bartender even ended up sending down a few shots of Jameson when they had overheard it was my first time being in Vegas.",

I had Irish Stew and hubby had bangers and mash.  He said it was  good but a little bland.  I felt the same way about my dish.   The lamb was very unevenly cooked, some tough and some not as bad.  Not many carrots or potatoes and had absolutely no flavor at all.  I'm sure the Irish don't eat like that.  We didn't do dessert, nothing tempted.  I think if we went back, it would just be to have a glass of wine or beer and an appetizer.",

Nine Fine Irishmen has often been on that list, but I've had a couple of bad experiences in a row and have decided that I need to write this place off. It's unfortunate, because the atmosphere has potential, and the menu has potential. Between poor service in the past and not so yummy food now, I think Nine Fine Irishmen has earned the removal from my list. They seem to charge an arm and a leg for food that would normally be 1/4 of the price somewhere other than Vegas. I love Irish fish and chips and have had them many places in the US. Typically, I can expect to spend about $30 for dinner for two (without cocktails). My meal was over $70 for 2 orders of fish and chips and one order of onion rings. I'm willing to pay a bit more in Vegas for the experience, but I also want the food to be good. In this case, it simply wasn't. The fish was so greasy that when I bit into it, grease dripped onto my shirt. The onion rings had more much more batter than onion. That can be a good thing, but the batter was bland. The fish batter was bland. The tartar sauce was bland. The fries were bland. There are too many good places in Vegas to waste my time on bad ones. So long, Nine Fine.... it wasn't really good while it lasted.",

Everything was decently priced. We sat inside (and loved the Irish themed decor), as well as outside on the patio.  In addition, they have high chairs and seem very kid friendly.

The bartenders are friendly and have good stories.  There are the usual beers you would expect at at Irish pub, and they get them to you quickly.    For appetizers, the beer n cheese dip is a must.  It's a lot of dip made with Smithwick's and served with several types of bread for dipping.  Just fantastic, we easily finished it.  The onion rings were not as big of a hit.  There are quite a few to an order and they are served with a good spicy mustard.  But, they need seasoning, we had to really salt them.  Overall, the dish was just flat.    I don't know how they did it, but they almost create a put atmosphere that makes you forget you are in a huge casino.

    "text": "I was on a visit to Las Vegas during the St. Paddy's week in 2017. So checking out the Irish Pubs was a natural.   I might mention that the primary purpose of my trip was a campus visit to start a PhD at UNLV in fall. But, checking out where most of my extracurricular hanging out is gonna be was also imperative. My first PhD in music is from UT, and Fado and Baker Street were two pubs where a lot of my time was spent. My U2 tribute band (Mysterious Ways) played at the former and my classic rock band (American Thighs) at the latter. Needless to say, We have fond memories of each, and of the damsels \"who helped us through the night\" (to quote Gordon Lightfoot).  As the quintessential outsider, an expansive cosmopolite, what I seek in a bar is a place that makes insiders of outsiders. Some Irish pubs can do that, and of the three I visited in Vegas, this one gets my vote.  I was drawn in around 1:30 AM by the sounds of a U2 cover, and JR at the door waived the cover for me, as the band only plays until 2:30. It's the same band, six night a week, but they are very good. Three members sing, and the harmonies are precise. A lead fiddler adds the Irish garnish, even to classic rock covers. It's a mix of Irish and British numbers, from traditional to contemporary, and they take requests. They also have an Irish step dancer who hops onto a dedicated table for some of the tunes.  As there's hardly any worthwhile socializing to be had on the strip other than with the hustlers, I came back on the following night, a Thursday. As I stood at the bar, I was approached by a sweet woman (something that never happens in the boondocks where I currently live), whom I immediately recognized as the fiddler/singer with the band. She said I was a \"lovely man\" and offered me her CD and business card. Well, on next couple of days, my best friend was in town, and both of us were let in without a cover. The guys at the door also work in the Irish spirit, very welcome in the American $$$ zombie dream of the strip. (Hey, Maire, the fiddler, also does a great version of \"Zombie\" with the apposite dance moves. It's a hit, every night!)  Overall, on the Strip this was the only place I saw \"regulars.\" I guess locals do hang out on the Strip.  Drinks: I tried a Guinness one night ($12, including tip) and Long Island ($14, including tip). A shade less expensive than other places on the Strip, I understand, but definitely not Austin prices.   Overall, currently this is the only bar that makes me look forward to going toward the Strip when I move to Vegas in August. But I hope to find others.  Cheers!",

Great atmosphere for a Casino bar and had conversations with several bartenders who took the time to explain the menu and the background of the bar....very much appreciated...thanks guys !  I see others explaining items that I ordered and I am not necessarily a foodie so I am sure they did it justice better than I would.  I greatly enjoyed the food and tried several beers I had not seen before.  I would go back in a flash !",

I love good bread pudding and can't stand bad bread pudding.  If you like bread pudding or have never tried bread pudding YOU MUST GET THE BREAD PUDDING.  It is the best bread pudding I ever ate and is the best dessert I've ever had.  Days later on our departure day we stopped to get one to eat and one to go.  We asked the hostess if the bread pudding would last with a 4 hour car trip.  She checked with the chef.  Executive Chef David Suppe came out to talk to us.  He said it would last if kept in a cooler with ice which we had.  When we were almost finished eating our bread pudding David brought us one ready for the trip in a plastic container with instructions on how to prepare it when we got home.  He also gave us the reciepe on how to make it.  When we got home we prepared it and it was delicious.  I don't know how you can top that service.  It made a perfect end to our vacation.",

Of course, its Vegas, so it's only slightly more authentic than the rest of Vegas, but as a restaurant it's quite nice.  In fact, this was actually a return trip to this pub. Both times that we've been, the host/wait staff has been friendly, helpful an ready to serve.  This time, was sat in a small demi-room with a couch-booth.  It made me happy and the delicious Magner's cider (so much better from the tap than from a bottle) kept me nice and comfy in my seat. Plus, we were seated upstairs, where the bar is, so the noise of the casino was blotted out entirely. Both times I've eaten here, I've been happy.  The waitress recommended the horseradish crusted halibut, which was worth the recommendation.  My husband had the chicken pot pie, which was full-flavored and rich.  Since he's british and a pickey eater to boot, this is a good sign. In short, I can't speak to its authenticity, but the food, atmosphere and beer are worth a stop.",

This was the worst Irish bar I have ever been in.  We sat down at a table and waited for a server.....and waited...and waited.  So I go up to the bar and order some drinks. I asked the bartender if we could have a server take our dinner order and he said one will be there soon.  We waited...and waited...finished our drinks and still no server????  So I walked over to the doorman to see if we could get a server.  He goes in the back and a server comes out who looks like like she wanted nothing do do with taking our order???  We order some appetizers because the prices were ridiculous.....I know it's Vegas but come on $21 for fish and chips ??? what do they use swordfish ???  Not just the food but $7 dollars for a shot of Irish Mist  ??? and he hardly filled the glass.  Listen I have never spent the time to write a review good or bad on any place but this place really got to me.  Next day we went to Ri Ra Irish pub at Mandalay Bay it it was awesome...get service...great prices and great atmosphere.",

The food was delicious, we had the tomato salad and braised short ribs. The only drawback is the big screen TVs are tuned to UFC. We asked our waiter if it was possible to change the station and he gladly did, but within 30 seconds it was back to UFC. Don't really understand the correlation between an Irish pub and UFC. We were offered to come back for the Irish band later in the evening using our receipt from earlier.  I'd definitely go back but ask to be seated away from the tv!",

It came in a huge pot with the flaky bread overflowing at the top, and the middle had almost a tomato bisque with peas and chicken inside, and it was simply unbelievable!!!! If they cut the chicken a little smaller, it'd be easier to eat, by Id be heartbroken if they changed anything about the flavors!!!!! So good. I regret trying other restaurants while we were in town.  (And, on a kid note, they absolutely loved the mac and cheese.)",

We were seated rather quickly and ordered right away. My husband had the Shepherds Pie which came out in a small (but deep) aluminum bucket . My husband said it was good but said the cheese was excessive - so I'm guessing the ratio of ground beef to potatoes and cheese was off.   I ordered the grilled salmon salad which was actually good but I wish I had asked them to skip the goat cheese. I'm realizing I'm not really a fan of. But if you are, they are generous here with huge chunks throughout the salad. I just picked it out and moved to the side.   Service was great and very personable. I wish I got our server's name. She had a great personality - chatted up with all of her tables but didn't cross the line of overstaying her welcome.    If you want to skip the \"food court\" area and have a nicer but casual sit down experience - this is a solid choice.",

I ordered the drunken onion rings and the colcannon soup. The onion rings were average, but the colcannon soup was delicious! I only make colcannon once a year and not in soup form so I was excited to try it. It did not disappoint. The service was decent and they had great specials (it was Superbowl weekend). We sat outside which was nice; good spot for people watching. I really wanted a tshirt from here, but they only sold shirts for this place in the New York Casino which I didn't feel like trying to navigate. We frequent Vegas often so this will probably become one of our go to spots.",

    "text": "Well, It's Restaurant Week once again in Las Vegas, and not to be left behind (so many fine offerings, but so little time), Diane, I, and a friend began with lunch here on Day 1.  It was a very good start to RW, but not without a few down notes.  Just my luck, this was the first day of MGM-Mirage's paid valet parking, which cost me $13 plus a $2 tip to help pay for the parking lot that the casino giant should have built before opening its new 20,000 seat T-Mobile Arena.  It is the valets who will suffer.  I used to always give a $5 tip but they will be lucky to receive anything now.  I noticed that none of the few drivers before me extended any tip at all when they claimed their vehicle, and I was profusely thanked for my token recognition of good service.  At least the pathway to the top of valet parking was wide open!  The other downer for me was that because I had just devoured a giant fillet of Pecan-Crusted Walleye Pike at Big Dog's less that 15 hours earlier, this time I was not in the mood for any more fish.  So instead I ordered the Irish Banger & mashed potatoes.  When I did so, in my mind two gravy-laced sausages appeared.  But on my plate there was only a single specimen.  I rechecked the menu, and--sure enough--\"Banger\" was reflected in the singular.  My mistake!    Diane's bowl of Tomato Gin Soup--which I got to eat--was a nice, creamy soup; and my Mixed Green Salad with Cherry Tomatoes, Red Onions, and Balsamic Vinaigrette a colorful and interesting first course.   The sausage was good, and the Mustard Mashed Potatoes and Mushroom Jus great, but one little sausage to me is not enough bang for my stomach.  Bread & Butter Pudding was sweet and filling, with lip-smacking sauce that almost made up for my dainty entree--but not quite.  Meanwhile, my two female companions very much enjoyed their two rounded golden hunks of battered Fish and Chips.  Good complimentary Soda Bread & Irish Butter helped to fill me up.  Couch seating was comfortable, and service very good, with refills of ice as well as Iced Tea regularly supplied without request.  A solid 4-star meal on the Strip at a very low price (just $20), for a good cause!",

We saw reviews of \"be prepared for the wait staff to be standing around\" which we saw but at the same time we never had to ask anyone else for our waitress and the drinks never sat empty (huge pet peeve).  My wife had the Druken Peach from the bar, highly recommended. We had the fried pickles to start, very good pickles and the tartar sauce was fantastic! She had the wedge salad it was average, not great but not bad. I had the Irish Bangers, amazing. Great mushroom gravy, the bangers had great flavor, the garlic mashed potatoes were wonderful. Would definitely recommend coming here if Irish style pub food is sounding good.",

My husband said the Shepard's pie was great. I was a tad disappointed in my chicken curry. It didn't have enough sauce and it didn't leave a lasting impression. The only bad thing is I believe they should update the bar stools upstairs. They really weren't comfortable at all. We will be back.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try Nine Fine Irishmen for quite awhile and I got the chance to go with two friends before they returned to England.  We had neglected a reservation and that was a mistake.  We had about a 20 minute wait.  However, it seems that there were several tables available all the time--just no staff to cover them.  After being seated on the second floor, we got drinks and I ordered an iced tea, Colcannon soup, and fish and chips.  The tea was brought and we placed our orders.    Within a brief time, I got my Colcannon soup--a potato soup with onions, leeks, and savoy cabbage.  The texture was very nice and the soup was excellent.  The only reason to return here would be for a bowl of this wonderful goodness.  The entree did not continue a good impression of the restaurant.  The wait time was longer than necessary, and the fish was not what I like when I get fish and chips.  The batter was soggy--not crisp at all--I'm guessing from sitting under a heat lamp too long.  The fish was over cooked.  Our server seemed to have a fair number of tables and just didn't get the tables taken care of in a timely manner.  The chips were OK.  This visit to Nine Fine Irishmen taught me that it's not necessary to go back.  Well, maybe to have some more of the soup.  Other than that, I'd avoid it for one of the neighborhood Irish pubs that serve much better executed dishes.",

There are a few tables, mostly bar top seating, and a large stage where they have live music. It seems that events here would also be fun.   Their Irish breakfast is so good! Not only is it the perfect pick-me-up after a wild Vegas night but it makes for great leftovers if you need a snack later on in the day. They also had a pretty good selection of beer.

    "text": "We had two meals here during our recent trip to Las Vegas, so I'm covering both in this one review.  Thanksgiving Lunch:  Having a good Thanksgiving Lunch was important to us, we're usually the ones hosting it at our house, this year the wife and I decided to escape to Vegas, but we like our holiday meals and it had to be a good one.  If you read another review, you'll know another place in the New York New York Hotel messed up our reservation, this became our back up plan - in reality I think we actually lucked out here.  Not only did we get straight in on Thanksgiving Day with NO reservation, we were immediately seated and assigned one of the most friendly and bubbly servers who was very engaging in conversation and an absolute pleasure.  On top of that we had GREAT food so thank you Nine Fine Irishmen for coming to the rescue.  Between us, we tried most items on the Thanksgiving menu!  They had both turkey based and ham based main dishes, so we got one of each and traded back and forth.  They were both amazing.  The chowder soup starter was literally to die for, and the bread pudding desert - well if I wasn't in utter ecstasy eating it and making sure I got \"my share\" before the wife did I may have written down all the adjectives I wanted in my phone as notes for my subsequent review.  I almost just said, heck, forget the Blackjack tables, send us 4 of those to our room!  Suffice to say it was all eaten.  We're not generally people who get through entire deserts especially in a big meal like this, but we were not going to be defeated this time, and defeated we weren't!  Breakfast:  On a later day during out trip we decided to go back here for breakfast, after the Thanksgiving experience we wanted to try more and find out if it was as good in more general terms.  Well my phone notes for breakfast start with \"OMG, most awesome breakfast ever, corned beef and sausage WOW\".  I think quite honestly I can use that without having to even add anything more or really edit.  It stands for itself and is exactly how I remember it!",

Today we were seated at a table that is right in the middle of traffic as people walk right through from the street just to get to the casino.  Also, I was so looking forward to the Sheperds Pie and I was so disappointed. My girlfriends crab cake was tasteless. The only good item we ordered was the creamed corn.  Our server Timothy was very nice and brought my friend a bread pudding cake for her birthday. It was so nice of Timothy to give her the cake since the hostess informed me that they were under new management and only shots are offered.  Lastly, the music was so loud you couldn't have a conversation and it was so unpleasant we couldn't wait to finish our meal.  Not sure if we will ever dine there again.   Please don't review this business if you received a freebie for writing this review, or if you're connected in any way to the owner or employees.",

The decor is also great and pretty darn authentic if you ask me! I couldn't stop looking around.   Great beers on tap and a great menu!  I enjoyed a Newcastle, and they also had Guinness, Harp and a few other delicious beers on tap in addition to a long list of bottled beers and other spirits. I wanted to try EVERYTHING on the menu but obviously couldn't do that. So we started with onion rings that are soaked first in their Bloody Mary mix and then battered, fried and served with their spicy mustard... YUM! My friend had a Corned Beef sandwich and I enjoyed my sandwich (which I sadly can't remember the name of) but it had large slices of beef, peppers, spicy mustard and some beer-cheese sauce on it...

Literally felt like I stepped into a slice of Ireland. this place felt so cozy, i wanted to sit and stay awhile.  Service was superb the entire time, our waitress was a doll.   Started off with an appetizer of the Beer n' cheese dip.  Assorted breads complete with a cheese dip infused with Smithwick's Irish Ale.  One of the best cheese dips I have ever had, I could have had this as my meal (with all the carbs I inhaled, I probably should have) OH well, when in Vegas! :)  For lunch I got the Corned Beef Sandwich.  Corned beef was chopped up in bit sized pieces making this the easiest corned beef sandwich to eat.  Corned beef was piled high and falling out the sides, i had the bacon mayo topped this baby and it was a big hot delicious mess that I enjoyed every second of.   I could not move mind you after this entire experience, but ohhh it was so worth it.  Next time I am in Vegas, this will surely be on my to do list again. DELICIOUS!",

I ordered this fried sausage appetizer that came with honey mustard dressing.  They were sooooo good.  We sat at the bar but there's a full restaurant and a stage for a band.

We were there in time for happy hour, and got some great drinks and appetizers off that menu. And then we ordered the lamb stew...which was incredible! I'm still dreaming about it. But the best, best aspect was the bartender Magdalena. She was fun and attentive and made great drinks (we just asked for something fruity with vodka and she did not disappoint) and was definitely the highlight of that experience.",

We went a couple times for HH and once for brunch. Beer selection is good, food was great. We splurged on the cheese deep and the fried sausages. Breaded and fried sausages, with a creamy mustard sauce to dip! They were absolutely delicious and probably put me close to cardiac arrest. Only in Vegas!  The brunch was also excellent; I had the full English breakfast which was a nice selection of different things to try. I don't think I'll eat blood pudding again, but I was glad I tried it.  The sandwiches got rave reviews as well. Definitely recommend trying this place, especially if you stay at NY NY.",

    "text": "I love this place; it's probably one of my favorites in Vegas.  It certainly doesn't rank up there with the high end, celebrity chef restaurants, but the food is consistently good, the drinks are mostly excellent, the service has always been nice and friendly, and the prices are reasonable for where you are.  We came here with a $100 voucher to celebrate my birthday dinner (following a disappointing lunch elsewhere) and our final night in Vegas and NFI did not disappoint.  We made reservations, although I have come here without them in the past and have generally not had to wait more than 10-15 minutes for a table.  If you have to wait, they give you a pager so you can go play in the casino until it's ready.  They're currently remodeling to expand the front of the restaurant and add a patio in the back, so the entrance has been moved but there are plenty of signs to direct you around.  The restaurant itself has two levels and I prefer the upper, which is a bit more spacious and not as cave-like.  There's an elevator that they are happy to let guests use if you don't feel up to taking the stairs.  We were there too early for music this time, but have seen performances in the past that were pretty good, if a bit loud.  I was very torn between the beer & cheese dip and the brie cheese appetizer and had just about made my mind up for the former when our friendly waiter mentioned that the brie was among his favorites.  I can take a hint and switched my order mid-sentence.  I can't tell you if I regret missing out on the beer & cheese dip, but I can tell you that I in no way regret ordering the brie and crackers which were delicious, a bit unusual, and had a nice kick thanks to some strategically used chili oil.  For drinks, mom started with a citrus drop (essentially a lemon drop) and I opted for something else that I now don't recall what it was.  Needless to say, I switched to citrus drops for the rest of the evening as they were far better than my first choice.  Foodwise, mom went with her favorite standby of shepard's pie, which was delicious as usual.  I agonized over the menu for a bit (noticing a theme here?) and finally decided to take a chance on the lamb stew, which I recalled my dad enjoying several years before.  I'm very particular about my lamb - I like it when it's done right and loathe it otherwise.  NFI was oh, so very right.  I managed to restrain myself from licking the bowl clean but only just.  For dessert, we split one of their decadent bread puddings, and it very nearly did us in.  We left stuffed, tipsy, happy, and with the birthday and the vacation ending on a perfect high note thanks to NFI.  You can bet I'll be back!",

From traditional Irish ballads to something new and rocking, they have a great time on stage and that transfers to the crowd for sure.      Our first time here was for the inaugural NYE Party in 2005-- It was called the Horns and Halos Bash back then.  Tons of fun, as they block off the Brooklyn Bridge from the strip, and you get to see the crazyness without needing to be shoulder to shoulder with it.  Its now called the Bridge Bash, but it is just as good as it was back then when we showed up for 2015.  Your entry fee gets you in the party, and all you can drink for the night... including top shelf whiskeys (Yes, I was in heaven!).  Security is quick to respond to any issues (we had a woman drunkenly bothering us... shoving us and then stealing our hats.  They took care of it quickly).  It was a chilly evening this year, but the heaters outside on the bridge area worked great, and I dont recall anyone in our group really feeling cold.  You have a prime view of the fireworks at midnight, too.  Irish Car Bombs are made perfectly, and with just the right amount of foam.  The Fallen Angel used to be a specialty drink here, but I didnt see it on the menu during this last trip.",

I don't really know but it didn't have the taste of a really fresh piece of cod.  The good news is, that's the worst thing I can say because I left happy.  The fries were good, the malt vinegar was fresh, and the draft Harp lager was delicious.  The atmosphere was really nice and I was in an area that seemed to be a collection of small dining rooms, complete with lost patrons wandering through.  The highlight was the waitress, who seemed to be one of the most sincerely pleasant people I encountered during my stay in Las Vegas.  She had short blond hair and I think her name was Samantha, but I'm not sure.  I'd go back to Nine Fine Irishmen without hesitation.

What is great about this spot is the bartenders. I usually have the same one and he is just awesome - very friendly and attentive.",

If there's a band, forget trying to make any conversation in there.  Mac and cheese was great was herbed chicken with Boursin bread pudding (YUM).  The bloody Mary-soaked onion rings were fabulous (I wouldn't miss those if that's your thAng).  The only complaint I had was really service-related.  It was Sunday night (Easter, no less) and they told us it'd be a 1/2 hour wait at 8 PM.  We grabbed some drinks and hung out by ourselves with no servers on the back upstairs outdoor patio (which was a great little secluded spot).  However, after 40 minutes, we were finally seated.  The restaurant was 1/3 empty outside and several \"reserved\" tables for 4 were never filled the entire 2 hours we were there.  I hate that.",

Coming from boston, I wanted to find an Irish pub that also offered the \"Vegas experience. This place offers both!  First of all, the atmosphere is great! It has two floors, and also offers and outdoor seating patio right on the strip, where you can people watch, too. Pretty much whatever atmosphere you're looking for, this place has! The entire place is designed and appointed to look like an authentic Irish pub, and there's a great place in the back for the band or whoever is performing to get on stage. It can get very busy and boisterous on the weekend evenings, but hey...you're in Vegas, and it's a fun spot!  There are two bars here, one on each floor, which is very handy if you're moving around. You don't have to walk a whole flight just to get a drink! They have a great selection on tap, and the bartenders are on point and professional.   The menu/food here is probably not the best you'll have in this city...probably not by a long shot. I personally wouldn't choose this place to eat, though. It's more about the atmosphere, and a place you stop with friends to grab drinks, talk, and enjoy the entertainment and people watching. If you come just for the meal, you'll probably leave less than satisfied.  Overall, a nice little Irish pub on this end of the strip. It's conveniently located in the NY-NY hotel, and it's right on the strip, so it's fairly easy to get to. This place is worth a stop if you're in this area.",

The patio was very relaxing and had lots of spots for people to hang out.   We 3 girls decided to go with a few appetizers. Brie w/ bread, clam steamers, and Irish Nachos w/ steak. ALL freaken delicious. All generous portion sizes. My friend's boyfriend got a ribeye, garlic mashed, and asparagus. I tried all, and it was really good as well.   Our service was so-so. We didn't see our server much which is the reason for the 4  stars. Food was a 5.   I'll go back. I didn't get to try an Irish beer, so next time I'll do that.",

The shepherds pie was literally like someone put in ground beef and carrots with mashed potatoes and no extra flavors. It was like something I'd make for my dog. Sorry. The creamed corn had no flavor whatsoever. It was so dull. The sodas for some reason were not carbonated. I had a sierra mist and I thought it was flat so I changed it to a coke. Same problem but I didn't want to complain and seem stuck up.   I did however like the rack of lamb (med rare). It was perfect. WARNING! They do not come with sides, but when you do order a side item it is pretty big so its enough for two people to share.   The hostess was very sweet. The server was nice but rarely checked up on us. Didn't get a refill either.  I was looking forward to eating here all day hoping to get the same great taste I received at the Irish Restaurant in Mandalay Bay, but I was very disappointed. Hopefully when I eat at the other location tomorrow I wont be dissatisfied.  TIP: It wasn't only my table that felt this way. When the bus boy came and asked us how was everything we told him our opinion on the food and he agreed. He said it was a new chef and they claim everything is the same as the Irish Restaurant at Mandalay but the other restaurant was  much better to his opinion too.   SAVE YOUR MONEY AND GO TO THE OTHER IRISH RESTAURANT IN THE MANDALAY BAY SHOPPES!",

The service was also impeccable. Our glasses never hit empty and the waitress was very attentive.

    "text": "I would love to review this place's food, but the hostess was so unbelievably RUDE that I immediately left with a group of co-workers after a 10 hour day at CES. That's how bad it was.  The hostess's name badge said \"Martiza from El Salvador\". I could care less where she's from, but hopefully someone from Nine Fine Irishmen will read this, be able to identify her, and at bare minimum send her back to customer service training.  We were running about 15 minutes late for our 7:30PM reservation. (HELLO, it's trade show season in Vegas -- it happens.) So, I called into Nine Fine Irishmen, and let them know. I was told on the phone, \"No problem, we'll push the reservation back to 7:45PM.\"  We arrived at 7:45PM on the dot. The hostess, Martiza, looked at our names and said, \"You're late, so you'll have to wait.\" I informed her that I had the reservation pushed back. Her boss came over and said, \"It's OK, I've got them.\" She was clearly irked, and started yelling as we walked away with him.  After he took us upstairs, he said to please enjoy ourselves while we were seated. But, we couldn't find a seat, and no one came to seat us. I went back town to Maritza to say, \"Where was your boss going to seat us?\"  Instead of telling us, she snottily yelled, \"I TOLD YOU there's no seating.\"  \"Well, MARITZA, your boss said there was, and was trying to seat us,\" I reminded her, my patience running out.  \"He doesn't do the seating charts, so he doesn't know. You're late, so we gave your table away. They're almost done, they're just finishing their drinks, so you'll be seated after they're done.\"   So, let me get this straight. In the fifteen minutes we were \"late\" (which is almost always a window that a restaurant gives you anyway, not to mention I had changed the reservation), you managed to seat ANOTHER party of four, get them through drinks, dinner, dessert, and a final round of drinks.  I don't think so. Martiza screwed up the seating chart, and then had the nerve to, instead of act like a classy, well-trained hostess, go on a pissy-pants party.  Any REAL hostess with real training (particularly in a foodie town like Vegas) would have said something  \"I'm so sorry, there is a little wait due to the rush with the trade show. Why don't you have a seat at the bar with a glass of wine or a beer on us, and we should be able to seat you in just a few minutes.\"   If she had done that, we would have stayed, and gladly spent our company's food and drink allowance there.  Instead, Maritza's horrible, entitled, condescending, and insulting tone and manner led all of us to decide to eat elsewhere. I said, \"We've decided we don't want to eat here,\" and handed her back the reservations. A huffy \"FINE,\" a slam of our menus down on her podium of stank attitude, and turning to gossip with another hostess (almost certainly about us) was her reply.   We went to Il Fornaio (also in New York New York), were seated within 10 minutes without a reservation, and had a great meal with lovely and attentive staff. Kudos to them!  I wouldn't step foot back in Nine Fine Irishmen as long as Martiza is a hostess. I hope that Nine Fine Irishmen takes a better look at their hosting and wait staff. There are so many places to eat in Las Vegas, and plenty other of wonderful Irish pubs (Ri Ra in Mandalay Bay, for one).   Customers don't need diva attitude!!!",

That stuff is off the hook (and this is coming from a person who doesn't even like beer.) I tried to re-create it at home and it paled in comparison. I mean, it was okay but it wasn't as bubbly, gooey and as mind-blowing as that dip. Don't skip the dip unless your vegan or allergic or whatever...  As a meal, I had the Colcannon Soup. I loved how the chunks of bacon contrasted the lightness of the soup. The soup itself reminded me of how my mom makes her broccoli and cheese soup -- all the ingredients blended smoothly together. Yum. It was good, but temperature wise it was only lukewarm. Lukewarm soup just bums me out :(  We also got the Bangers. They were just okay for me, although my hubby really enjoyed them. Nothing super memorable or special about them for me. I WISH i would have followed the reviews to finally try some Shepherds pie.   The atmosphere is fabulous and so much fun! There was a live band while we were there, so after dinner we hung out in the bar area for a bit to get drunk and listen to the band. Overall, I had a great experience and would visit next time we're in Vegas. If nothing else, I'll be back to get my hands on another serving of that beer and cheese dip.",

Got there around 9pm and originally we just wanted to grab a drink but there was an Irish band playing so we decided to stay a bit for the live music.   Lots of great draughts from the British Isle on tap.  For the majority of the night, we went with those and Harper, Guinness, and Bodington was the ones we went for.  It was a bit odd since the beers were served in plastic cups.  Price was a little over $8 per beer.  Not that cheapest, but meh... Vegas.  They even have a table that has the tap right at your table!  Didn't get to try it since this group occupied it the whole time.  The live band was actually pretty good!  They even had a girl doing the Irish tap dancing.  That's something we don't see everyday so that was pretty cool.  It seems like there were plenty of European transplants that night since many of them knew the songs.  Wonder how this place is on the weekends.",

Made a reservation (though I really don't think it was necessary) for a pre-concert dinner.  I get that this is a pub, and the bar area is half of the property; and I get that American bar patrons like their sports, but the 80\" TV right in the middle of the restaurant was very off-putting. The rest of the establishment is beautifully decorated, including the bar, and the giant basketball game really detracts from that carefully crafted decor. Thankfully we were seated in one of the small areas that weren't in view of the jumbo-tron, so we were able to have a nice atmosphere for dinner. There was Irish music playing quietly in the background, which was nice.  We each had an appetizer (soup for the wife) for which there was a substantial wait. My wife's Colcannon soup was very tasty, but it wasn't pureed completely, which resulted in a gritty texture that was not particularly pleasing. I love onion rings, so I had to give theirs a try. They were different... and fairly disappointing. They were beer battered, which is a plus as I prefer battered rings to breaded, and the batter was very good. Unfortunately, there were two major issues. First, the onions were chewy, which was odd. I don't know if this was a side effect of the bloody-mary soak or a cooking issue, but rubbery onion rings were the end product. The second issue was what ruined the dish though; these puppies were beyond salty. It was actually a little painful to eat some of them. The bloody-mary soak might have been a nice touch, but whatever flavor that added to the rings was overpowered by the ridiculous saltiness. For entrees (which arrived promptly) my wife opted for the chicken pot pie and I had the shepherds' pie. This time I got the better plate (or bowl, as the case may be). My meal was quite delicious. The meat and carrot mixture was heavily seasoned and braised in wine, which balanced with the mashed potatoes nicely. The serving size was plentiful, but not so large as to make me feel stuffed (i really hate that feeling). Now, my wife's pot pie; where should I start? It was huge, my wife was unable to finish it and I doubt that I would have been able to either. It was gorgeously presented. It was very flavorful, with a creamy tomato sauce in place of the traditional cream sauce, fresh vegetables, and large chunks of white meat chicken. It was TERRIBLY undercooked. What should have been a delicious, buttery, flaky crust was only so on the outside; after that, it was layers of partially cooked dough. The sauce also didn't cook down or thicken, resulting in a very soupy filling. Altogether this was a disappointing dish (though the flavor was good, so it could be saved). Service was interesting; our waitress alternated between spot-on and crummy and when she made a snide remark to a neighboring party as she walked past our table, my wife wasn't too happy. She was never rude to us, but she wasn't very cordial either. Maybe, like the other party, the rude comment meant for us was only heard by a different dining party.",

    "text": "This review is for the outdoor bar only.  Heading out of the New York New York Hotel feeling thirsty, my husband decided to stop and buy a drink. There was only one couple ahead of us, but the wait to order was kind of long for what seemed like an off-peak hour. (it was about 3:15 p.m. with no crowd). When it finally came time to order, the bartender ignored us to go and help his partner on the other side of the bar, which also wasn't busy. After he cleared her side, only then did he proceed to serve us.   Everything was fine even with the longer than expected wait time until he handed the receipt. My husband had paid for his beer with his card because he didn't have cash on him and I had gotten distracted and ventured off nearby. As my husband signed his signature, the bartender very rudely and rather loudly said in his most obnoxiously sarcastic voice, \"thanks a lot; I appreciate it!\"   The bartender had leaned over to sneak a peek at the tip and saw that my husband had put $0.00 What he didn't know was that we prefer tips to be paid out in cash and I was holding it at the time. My husband was planning on asking me for the money, but needless to say, I refused to give a tip for such horrible service, especially after that bartender's shameful display of entitlement!",

There is a cover charge or at least there was the night of this visit but the manager was kind of enough to waive it upon entering.  The downstairs area was pretty packed so we headed upstairs and were lucky to get a couple of seats at the bar. We ordered a few rounds of beers and ordered Fried beer batter Irish sausages to snack on.   The sausages are a great appetizer to share with friends. The batter was crispy, the sausage flavorful and the dish as a whole was non greasy. I would have ordered another round but we had plans for burgers later in the night. Didn't want to get full.  There was a live band playing a few Irish tunes. One song was Whiskey In The Jar the bartender stated. Never heard of it before and really didn't catch the lyrics but it's title speaks for itself. It is an Irish Pub so the tunes fit and the crowd enjoyed it. Speaking of whiskey in a jar, we also had a few shots of that. Keep the Jameson coming!  I'm happy I finally got a chance to check this place out. Lot's of fun and I'm sure it'll be even better during a St. Patties Day visit.  Drinks 2/11/2018",

We started with the beer cheese dip that is served with bread, bread sticks, and this thin, cracker-like bread. The cheese has a distinct beer taste to it and was so good that we practically cleaned the bowl out.   I ordered the shepard's pie for my entree, which arrived in a cute little metal bucket. The dish was thick and dense (not soupy) and stuffed full of meat, carrots, and onions and topped with a layer of mashed potatoes. I also got to share a side of the Mac and cheese which was ooey gooey cheesy (much like the beer cheese appetizer) and actually very flavorful and seasoned nicely.   As this was a birthday celebration and I am over 21, I was offered a shot with a candle instead of your typical ice cream scoop or cupcake. It was a fun way to end the meal.   Overall dinner was fairly priced, we all left full and happy, and there were some leftovers to enjoy for lunch the next day. This is going to be a place we keep in mind when we want to get dinner down on the strip, especially for the appetizers as there's a few more I want to try (and for the beer cheese-I miss it already).",

I think they opened a can of tomato paste and poured it out. That cheesy toast was good though!  The Irish breakfast was much better. Well seasoned potatoes, real corned beef hash, American breakfast sausage and Irish bacon. It was plenty of food for two of us thankfully.",

We tried the fish and chips at Robert Irvine's restaurant in Tropicana and that was beyond amazing but this one did not live up to my expectations. The pieces were small and greasy and just fell apart couldn't even dip it. There was really no taste to it. We also got shepherds pie which was ok but you get so much ground beef over everything else you are just left with so much of it. The mash on top was really good. The onion rings were really good.

I've most likely walked past this place countless times and never peaked my interest to stop in. So what brought me here? My family was visiting in town and stayed at NYNY. We had a really nice amount for a food & beverage to splurge around the property so why not?  When I walked up before even entering all I could hear is a bunch of people singing along to a song drunk lol. Having a blast! I didn't need to dine in since I just wanted a quick bite. I headed to the bar and ordered there. The bartender who helped me was really nice! Any one else who walked past greeted me as well so customer service is clearly on point at the bar. Buffalo Chicken Tenders and Fries.. Simple! I had a few rounds of drinks while waiting and enjoyed the people watching lol. It's definitely a fun place! You can request songs for the guy on the piano too which was pretty cool.  One of the odd things about this place is that the kitchen isn't actually located in the establishment lol. I asked the bartender where she was coming from back into the bar with the food. She informed me that they have to walk all the way to where it's located to grab the orders. So odd but okay... Food came out in a decent amount of time and tasted great. I will definitely return again in the future.",

They have been playing there for years, are always updating their set lists, take tons of requests, and simply put on one of the funnest live shows in town. They do this six days per week!!! I have been singing the praises of Ri Ra and the Nine Fine for years. It is always filled up with a great variety of people, and there are almost always people visiting from Ireland!

We sat upstairs. From outside who knew there would be an upstairs. Full bar on both levels. Our waitress Monica was very nice and patient. She took our photos for us. A+ for Monica! Would like to come back for the live music and dancing on the bars. Definitely recommend for small or larger groups. :)",

I had the wedge salad and it was well, a wedge salad that was not memorable, in fact my wife had to remind me what I had so I could write this review.

They had a $10 cover charge to get in but you got a wrist band which allowed you to come and go as you please until 2am, so that was a good deal.  Food and drink was extra of course but there was music inside and outside.  As for the food, it is definitely bar food and over priced.   They wanted $19 for a plate of Corned Beef, so instead we ordered the Nachos with Corned Beef on them...The corned beef was dry and not very tasty at all.  The cheese sauce they used was ok but we have had a lot better.  The drink prices were very expensive for what you got however, this place is located on the strip at NY NY, so what can you expect being on the Strip...  $9 for a shot of rum not even the best they had was sad, but again it's the Las Vegas Strip.  It was just ok, nothing special for bar food.  It was a great ambiance for St. Patrick's Day but not a place I would go to normally just to hang out.  If the prices were better then maybe but with so many other options in this city, its like no.  I am sure its a fun place to come to listen to music as they always have music and not every place has good Irish music, but other then that, its really not a place I would hang.",

Came here at 5:30pm for a UFC party and most of the tables were empty. The cover charge was 25 at the concierge but 35 at the door. I'm glad I went to concierge first. Once inside we get wristbands and select a stable. The tables had modelo buckets filled with UFC and modelo goodies. Hats, shirts, glass holder, all kinds of stuff. I was very happy with the products. Now the Boeing party does not have the full menu and instead has specials. The food specials were fantastic! I got tacos, extra large hot dog, nachos, chips and more! The tacos were 2 each, the hot dog was 4 and the nachos I think were 5. This is unheard prices in Vegas. They did have drink specials but I didn't get one. All the food was cooked outside and served to you right away. Except the hot dog they had to cook it when you order it. Now my hot dog with beer cheese was sooooo good and filling. Actually everything was good and very reasonable for the food. Overall I know I will be back here for viewing parties because they was great. The crowd was fun and no one was outrageous. Plenty of security made me feel very safe in the restaurant.",

There were 3 bartenders at 9:00pm and six customers at the bar; after 8 minutes we had to waive one of them down and ask for a glass of house chardonnay and a soda water from the gun.  We're not picky about house wines but they managed to find one of the few honestly bad generic wines.  The bill was $16; since the wine was listed as $11, I guess they charged me $5 for shooting some water into a glass from the gun.  Even by strip standards there are a lot better values and a lot better service.",

But I'm not fond of all that noise when I'm trying to visit with someone. So we did sit without conversation because we couldn't hear each other.

The bar is a warren of smallish rooms, with an 'atrium'-type area in the center for live bands and occasional Irish dancing, and a large outdoor seating area that's near the 'Brooklyn Bridge' on the Strip.  The central area inside is usually pretty crowded in the evenings, but people are friendly and make room -- as possible -- for people passing through or looking to claim a small space of their own near the entertainment.  Service is consistent and the staff is friendly.  The food is pretty good -- from a menu of Irish bar staples -- as are the prices (compared to similar dinner menus in Las Vegas).

Get the largest size of this soup--so many dimensions of flavor that make your eyes roll into the back of your head!!! If you've ever been to Ireland, you know the Irish know how to make a good pot of stew or soup, and this place stays True to it's roots.  Love, love, loved this soup...gosh wish I had a bowl right now... Fish and chips were moist and flakey.  Perfect pairing with a fresh glass of Guinness.  I am NOT a beer drinker, but when beer is this fresh--it's a  whole new world  And speaking of music, a live band takes center stage about 9:30 or 10.  And just like in the Ireland, the later it gets, the livelier the place becomes!! People start dancing and pounding on the wooden floors and bar...but just before you hit the dance floor, DO NOT pass on the golden bread pudding and an Irish coffee--and not a fake redi-whip cream coffee, this is a legit Irish coffee with Jameson and real thick Irish cream   I would have given this place 5 stars if not for the Sheppard's pie! The Sheppard's pie was blah.  No flavor...the chef must have forgotten to season   The ambiance, the service, the drink and food selections, along with pricing are  this restaurant, along with other food options at the New York, New York hotel have made me want to come back and stay!!",

Located just off the gaming floor with a patio available to those simply looking for a place to smoke and grab a pint, Nine Fine Irishmen is presented as a True Irish Pub and featuring lavish decorations including everything from Lady Justice to gnarly looking taxidermy the two-story space additionally offers no lack of seating options, a hefty wood table found in one alcove while our table sported a throne.  Open from 11a-11p seven days a week, Irish Folk played overhead by day with Live music on stage by nine, the menu at Nine Fine Irishmen entails a highly varied experience clearly intended to suit the interests of any sort of guest, even Vegetarians and the Gluten sensitive likely to find something worthwhile amongst the extensive bill of fare.  Dining at the odd hour of 3pm, dinner options available to our group despite the technical start-time of five, it was on the heels appetizers that I arrived to meet the rest and although well sated from a prior dining engagement I could not help but sample the now-somewhat-congealed Beer Cheese signature, the depth of flavor actually quite impressive despite the tasteless white bread.  Treated to pleasant service that thankfully dresses the role without putting on a fake accent like other \"Pubs\" in town, it was a touch perplexing that neither tablemate had opted to order any of Nine Fine Irishmen's green-box-highlighted menu classics and although the health-conscious Mahi-Mahi was well cooked with great flavor complimented by horseradish alongside fresh vegetables the hefty plate of lamb chops was severely compromised by a pungent crust that buried the lightly cooked meat's intrinsic gaminess, the dark brown sauce adding a unique bit of flavor, but at the same time seeing natural flavors further lost.  Debating Shepherd's Pie and Bangers before finally opting for Fish and Chips it was alongside the surprisingly crisp and well-executed \"Irish Nachos\" that two planks atop a pile of fries arrived, the tartar sauce cast aside in favor of malt vinegar plus ketchup with both parts of the plate quite good even when compared to some of the stuff in London, the Cod itself moist and meaty while the golden shell was virtually oilless and faintly accented by beer.  More impressed by the Macaroni and Cheese here than by others gussying it up with all sorts of junk it was onward to sweets that the meal progressed, and with only two items sampled thanks to the limited sweet-tooths of my companions the results were split right down the middle - my steamy Bread and Butter pudding turned from cup tableside with a pillowy texture not dissimilar to Monkey Bread with two excellent sauces while the \"Bomb\" selected by others lived up to its billing by failing completely, the center most certainly not 'soft' and the dried out exterior only saved by slowly melting ice cream.  *** No worse than other upscale Irish Pubs speckled around the country, Nine Fine Irishmen is precisely what one might expect walking through the door and although a bit more expensive than some might consider acceptable the price is mostly right for its execution of the classics...not to mention the service, location and decor.",

Our server was personable, told us about the days events, suggested after we went to our concert, go to the fireworks, and then please come back as the bar would have live music and another happy hour at that time. He was a delight.  However, today was a different story. No service, flagged down 4 waiters, 3 of which were very rude. Got our own drinks, plates and silverware from a pile on the counter. Ordered onion rings from the bar, still no waiter, flagged down 4th waiter and asked about our onion rings as we had been waiting about 30 min. He went to check on them and came back 5-10 min later with our order. He apologized and asked if we needed anything else. In our opinion, the cook sabotaged our order. They were bitter with salt, completely uneditable. We complained about the service and were told that the person we first dealt with was special forces and he couldn't do anything about it.  We won't be back..... Ever......",

    "text": "The Wife has been talking about going to see some fine Irish men for years. Although i have always been a little concerned about this, i decided that this year i would finally let her. So I grabbed her Lucky Charms and off to New York New York Hotel and Casino we went .  The Nine Fine Irishmen Pub is always busy and the evening that we went was no exception. We did not have to wait for a table, however , when we got seated in the dimly lit dining room, we were greeted with a view of the restroom. This was not ideal, but at least with a complete 360 turn around of our necks we could see the stage where a great Irish folk band was rockin the Riverdance, and a sixty something year old midget in her leprechaun costume ( I'm not kidding) was burning up the dance floor.I was looking forward to seeing a sexy Irish waitress straight from the country side come over to take our order, and i did not have to wait long. Although she probably had some country in her, the sexy and the Irish part seemed to be missing. So with a little disappointment in my voice I placed my order with Marlborough Lung Cancer Granny. I decided that after the leprechaun midget ,Irish folk band , restroom view seating and total lack of Irish tail that a strong drink was needed. I went with Gaelic Punch, it was loaded with a bunch of  Rum(s), and Midori and did the trick. Before long I was smiling like a kid that had just found a four leaf clover.  For the food, Simone and I started out with the Potato Basket. Although not the most adventurous of choices, you really can not go wrong with thick slices of deep fried potatoes. The potatoes were served with Red and Yellow curry sauces that were both very good. And the portion was large, consisting of at least a couple of good sized spuds.  For the entree Simone decided on The Herb Crusted Goat Cheese salad. Although (as discussed in previous blogs) salads are not an entree, I decided to keep my opinion to myself and let my wonderful wife enjoy her rabbit food. The salad consisted of Arugula with other mixed greens, oven dried tomatoes, caramelized onions, and a big heaping spoon full of goat cheese topped off with a Hazelnut Dressing.  Simone said it may have been the best salad EVER.  And she would know, she loves salad- as an ENTREE. For my tastes, I also found it to be very good and the goat cheese was excellent. Next up was my choice, a real entree, the traditional Shepherds Pie. Now this was comfort food. No frills, just damn good and piping hot. Topped with a mashed potato crust it arrived in a mini cast iron pot and was filled with tender morsels of sirloin steak, not the ground up junk, but real chunks of good beef tips mixed with carrots, and onions in a thick and rich port wine gravy. The BEST EVER Shepherds Pie. No cream of corn, or any other gross stuff that mom used to put into it (sorry mom) .This was just a simple,  warm your insides on a snow filled night kinda meal. It was excellent.  So ended our visit to Ireland. Although it started off a little scary, it ended great. Great Food, good drinks, good music and a lot of fun.",

Good food, and a great pub atmosphere complete with Irish pub songs (including Dirty Old Town & Seven Drunken Nights!)    It's my favorite place to get away from the endless ringing of the slot machines that haunts my ears in Vegas.  Nothing like a Guinness or Smithwicks, & some good pub songs to erase that clatter!  If I had to make one complaint, the food can get a little pricey, but everything in Vegas is pricey, and at least the food at Nine Fine is worth the price!   I hung out for dinner and a few beers, and forgot how much I missed it in my time away.  Oh Nine Fine, rest assured that I'll return again when I'm back in Las Vegas.  You have been christened my home away from home.  :-)",

BUT I am suspect that the chef took leftover soup that was on the menu with LEEKS & Onions (yuck) in it and adapted it to make the Chicken Pot Pie which resulted in an onion and leeks pie with a few bits of carrot potato and chicken. Now an onion lover would have liked it but me? I hate onions. It ruined it and as it made its way out (the wrong way) all the flavor was onion, onion, onion. The chef took a short cut cause the menu narr mentions leeks and dbl onions as part of this dishes recipe. Ambience? Hands down just a great place to be with friends and lovers both.",

Nine Fine Irishmen did not disappoint.   My wife and I went were before seeing Zumanity. It was in the same Casino so it worked out for us. We walked in with out a reservation. They seated us promptly on the second floor of the restaurant. The atmosphere was really nice. Not the best for Irish Pubs I've been in, but it did give you a nice laid back impression. It was busy enough to keep your attention, but not so busy as to distract you.   I love Bangers and Mash, so that's what I ordered and I was not disappointed. Two thick Irish sausages over mustard mashed potatoes and a mushroom gravy on top. DELICIOUS! These were some of the best ones I've ever had. Even upon returning home to my local pub, I had to break the news that the Bangers and Mash and Nine Fine Irishmen were better. Loved it!  My wife ordered the pan roasted red snapper with heirloom tomato and caper butter. She loves red snapper and she really liked it here. She let me try some and it was so flavorful. The fish and the sauce combined. She let me try some, but I'm not a big red snapper fan. I liked it, but I think my bangers and mash was much better.   The service was okay. There were a couple of times our server seemed to disappear and we couldn't find her. She was also a little slow to bring the check at the end.  I also didn't like the fact that there wasn't a bathroom in the restaurant. You had to leave and go back into the casino to find one. I asked if there was one closer and they told me no.   Overall the atmosphere was great, the food was good, the service was ok and the bathrooms... non-existent.",

As tends to be my Vegas fare (think: too hung over to eat real food), I ordered a salad and shared a turkey and corn chowder with a friend, based upon the recommendation of our server. Despite the fact that I came in wearing a sparkly dress, 5\" heels and hair that had clearly not been brushed, this waitress welcomed me with warmth and no evident judgment (look, I was judging myself by the way I appeared). She listed the specials and was understanding when we required more time to make decisions.  When the soup came out, we were surprised by how filling and delicious it was. Two of my friends ordered shepherd's pies, the other a sandwich she didn't even touch. All of us were pleased with our food, which was reasonably priced for being on the strip. The service was prompt and our server kept returning to check in on us and insure we were having the best possible experience. Three cheers to Nine Fine Irishmen!",

There's plenty of tables upstairs and downstairs and there's also a bar on both floors as well. They have a ton of beers on tap and drink choices. We wanted to order food but the kitchen was closed already.   Overall this is a nice place to chill and have a drink. It's noisy downstairs but not too bad upstairs. An Irish band plays there all night so we watched them of the time and watched the drunk people dancing and singing along. Every so often, a woman with the band would get up on a table and start doing an Irish. It was pretty awesome.",

We came to eat the food so was disappointed to pay the cover charge (violinist and tap dancer was pretty cool). We werent that hungry so we ordered the shepherd's pie and drunken onion rings. 5 starts for the food. It was tasty. The onion rings were crispy and gave a decent portion.  Didnt like the sauce much...was too spicy for me. The shepherd's pie was really good...first time trying anything like that so can't compare it to anything.  One star for the service.   After getting in, we weren't acknowledged and just found a seat. We tried to flag down the waitress but she ignored us or didn't see us. When she returned 5 minutes later we asked for the menu. We flagged her to order. We wanted to order a drink and tried to get her attention and she walked past us again. Granted, it was busy. But she wad the ONLY server in the entire place on a Saturday night.  Come ON. When she passed again I shouted \"EXCUSE ME!\" because she obviously wasnt checking her surroundings to see if the customers needed something even when I was looking at her and flailing my arms. She seemed stunned and shocked that I shouted. But the music was loud and she was not checking up on us. We asked for a drink menu and she gave us one.  Finally, she came and took our order without us trying to call her again. The food came out and it was good. I tried to get her attention for one last time and asked her for a box, refill of waters, and the check all at once so I dont have to keep trying to get her attention. She refilled the water.  I had to get the busboy to get me a box. Then after maybe TWENTY minutes she brings the check after saying \"I see you got the box!\" She swipes the card and and we finally leave.   Ruined the experience. We were waiting so much. They need to get more wait staff especially on a Saturday night. She was so busy and she can't keep up with everything she needed to do. There were even people who had gotten up to pay because she was so inattentive.  But food was good! Too bad I can't say I'd go back there again.",

It was actually less than that which is always a plus. YOU MUST TRY THE BEER CHEESE BREAD APPETIZER. It's amazing. Everything is pretty decently priced for a sit down restaurant inside New York New York. The Sheppard's pie is to die for! I think this is my new favorite place in the area. The atmosphere is pretty great. The service was on point. Definitely give this place a try!",

So when they told me it would be 10 minutes til we could be seated for dinner it was strange that the beeper would not work on the patio. When I asked if they could come and get me on the patio, about 76 feet from them I was told it was to busy. O.K. The food was not bad but pricey, as is typical of food on the strip. It was well prepared. The service was sad. We had a party of 7 so were required to pay a mandatory gratuity, so our waitress figured she was going to get her tip regardless so she spent her time somewhere else. We saw her once when we ordered, then again 45 minutes later when out meal arrived.  Good pub grub with a gamble on the service.",

I have a soft spot for Irish bars to begin with but I really appreciate NFI; its nice to get away from all the glitz and glamor of this city that begins to suffocate you after a while.   I'm not Irish nor have I been to Ireland so i can't comment on the authenticity of this place; however, I can tell you that the decor and staff attire looks Irish, the atmosphere is friendly, entertaining, the food is outstanding (order the pork porterhouse--trust me) and they pour a proper guinness with a  foam clover. That being said, I'm pretty sure that Ireland would have no problem claiming this place.   The prices are predictably high but consistent with Vegas strip prices. Come during happy hour if you're here on a budget--NFI does have good HR deals.   Bottom line, come hungry, come thirsty, come here anxious to have fun--I guarantee a good time.   Cheers and enjoy!",

Here's what we ordered:  Guinness braised beef and mushroom pies with tomato relish and chive dressing -- nothing I would order again...pretty bland...not what we were expecting.  Heirloom tomatoes with goat, blue and farmhouse cheeses marinated in extra virgin olive oil and balsamic vinegar -- probably our favorite part of the night...nice tomatoes and cheeses...pretty yummy.  Cashel Blue cheese crusted NY strip with au jus -- this was a disaster...ordered it medium rare, but it came out well done...sent it back and as I jokingly predicted to my wife that it would come back to rare because the cook would be too afraid to over cook it again...unfortunately, I was right...second steak came back black 'n blue...looked almost like a piece of seared ahi...but hell, it was better than an overcooked piece of meat, but much to rare for my taste...we ate a little bit of it and left the rest.  This is a cool place and I'd definitely go back for drinks. For lunch or dinner...probably not again after this experience.",

You are bound to find something here to eat whether it's a more traditional Irish feast or something more main stream. Their beer selection is a little weak but they more than make up for it with Irish whiskeys and other hard A choices.  The smell of booze, old wood and Vegas fills this spot. It has multiple seating areas and floors, a bar and if you're lucky you can catch a live band playing here. I've bought CDs of some of the live Irish folk acts that have played here and I don't usually do that. Feel free to walk up to other patrons and say \"kiss me I'm Irish!\"... if they politely decline move on to the next table or if they stare at you confused just say \"hug me I'm Irish?\"... it's okay because you're in an Irish pub in Vegas. Right? I've had pretty fantastic wait staff numerous times. This is usually my first stop when I get to LV in honor of my late mother so I've just gotten off a plane, checked in and I'm a bit neurotic... and they put up with my insane and silly humor just fine... and even get a few quips in there themselves. It's a fun enviroment and all of the food I've had over the years has been good/great. If you're tired of the fancy foods and fanfare of other restaurants in Vegas and just want something delicious to eat and a good hard drink... The Irishmen has your back. I'm a fan!",

    "text": "The lack of authenticity is on par with the rest of Vegas. But Vegas is authentic in its own Vegas way. So it's authentically Vegas.   Located in New York New York, the inside part of the restaurant is supposed to look like an Irish pub, but it looked like what an Irish pub would look like if it were in Disneyland. We sat on the patio, which was great at night, because it's a pretty good view of the strip and still pleasantly warm without the sun burning your skin off.   Was the food good? It was pretty decent, better then I expected. Was it overpriced for what it was? Yes of course it was. But I still enjoyed it.The table enjoyed an appetizer of beer battered Irish sausage with Guinness mustard dipping sauce. It was okay, I personally like my bangers a little meatier and less squishy.   My boyfriend and I decided to split the Shepard's Pie, which they serve/bake in a metal bucket thingy. It was enough food for the both of us and $18. I still think my mom's Shepard's Pie tastes better, but she's really British, and of course home-cooking is always better. However some of the other members in our party got the steak, which is crusted with Blue Cheese for around $26 and everyone was raving about it.   People enjoyed Guinness, Murphy's, Harp, and more. So it's definitely a good place to go to get these things on tap in Vegas. However, they serve you in wimpy half pints for the same price as a regular one. Kind of sad.  We had fun here, and only had to wait about 30 minutes for a table with a party of 7. They had live music, and a real live Irish dancer who's tapping could be heard filtering through the bar onto the patio where we were sitting.  I would probably come back here and split the Shepard's Pie again, because it was enough food for half the price!",

I suggest going on a Thursday, Friday, or Saturday night when they have live music - it resonates through the entire building and provides a good ambiance to the evening.",

The pub had great architecture, and I didn't realize that it was actually built first in Ireland and shipped over. I saw the lamb stew under \"Traditions\" on the menu and it seemed perfect for the chilly winter night, along with a Black and Tan. The stew came in a bucket-like bowl, which was cute; it looked small, but the bucket was deep and contained a Lot of lamb and vegetables. The stew was warm and hearty, and the beer was a good beverage for the gameyness of the lamb. Definitely one of the mid-range options worth considering on the Strip.",

    "text": "We came here late last night because we heard it was a fun place. The music was good & fun but the place was pretty empty (it was late though & that was done).  We left very shortly after arriving though because our bartender wad so incredibly rude.  It was the rudest service ive had anywhere.   My brother ordered a shot and i asked for a glass of water and was given a nasty look & ignored.  When he walked by again we asked again so he poured the shot but still ignored the water request. I finally asked third time & he again gave us all the dirtiest look & asked for ID?? Then proceeded to check it under the bar for overinute then finally got me a glass.  Our whole group was just baffled. We were going to stay and drink/eat/dance but left immediayly bevause the guy was such sn a**hole. I would seriously recommend managememt look into the asian bartender  from last because me + my group of 7  will never be returning.  We are still so stunned today after how horrible be treated us.",

We loved it the only thing we feel they should improve on is a little more Thousand Island dressing. The potato salad that accompanied the dish was definitely an Irish potato salad Bland. We love this place we come here every time we are in Vegas it is worth the trip if nothing else to eat here, very enjoyable we give it a nine out of the ten.",

Shepherds pie, Irish bangers, fish & chips, rack of lamb & chicken pot pie.  We are a \"sharing group\" of friends so I got to try everything.  It was all great with just enough spice to give a lot more flavor than the overseas versions.  An excellent dinner had by all, great service & atmosphere to boot.  My wife & I came back 2 nights later as they had live music & a beautiful Irish step dancer entertaining the crowd.  Next thing we know it's 2am and it just keeps going.  What a great visit.",

As we were walking by New York New York we decided to give this place a chance. It looked cozy. We were sat at a table outside that was partially in the sun, but the other ones had a reserved sign on them. As our server came by she noticed we were uncomfortable and prompted to offer us the table next to us in the shade with the reserved sign. Little did we know our best journey here had just started... Kelly, our server went above and beyond on every single detail with her funny, pleasant and amazing way of doing her job. From adapted food from the menu to please some of our pickier eaters to a very special Bread Pudding for our birthday boy with special add on. She made not only our day, my husband's birthday as the closing of our trip more than special.  Please all of you who are considering this place, go there and ask for Kelly!!! And Kelly, thanks for being so amazing!",

    "text": "I love this bar. It is always full of people and the music is spot on, authentic. It's a good thing the atmosphere is so amazing though because this place does have a few downsides.  First one- there is a cover charge which is odd for a bar. I understand that there is a live band playing... but still. It's not a night club. Although, a little tip for the military- show your ID and you get in for free. Even dependents!  Second one- the drinks are ridiculously expensive! Ok, I know it's a bar in Vegas, so it is to be expected to a certain extent, but $11 beers?? And I'm not talking Guiness, I'm talking Coors! Yikes!  Third one- lack of seating. The layout of this place is really awkward and hard to navigate. It is fairly narrow and situated so that most seats can get at least a small view of the band playing on stage. I don't know about you other ladies out there, but I am usually walking the strip in heels and dying for a place to sit down with my beer.  My favorite thing about this place?? You can't smoke inside! It is one of the few bars that I know of that I can actually breathe in! Ultimately, this is a destination bar. You come here to stay here for the night not just pass through and I love it.",

We had a waitress from Lima, and she was so nice and helpful even though it was later at night and could only order from late night menu. I'm sad I forgot her name, but she was kind, funny, and made great recommendations for us!  Overall it was a good place to enjoy people's company, listen to music, eat good food, and have a good time without needed to go to a sleezy bar/club.   Get there early if you want to try other foods because the late night menu is limited. We were sad we couldn't try the shepards pie!",

The entertainment was just amazing and knew how to draw the crowd to attempt an Irish jig and they even had an Irish dancer who would randomly start dancing.

We stop by NFI every time we are in Vegas just to see the band play. They are amazing!!!!!!!!! I never get tired of this place. The songs are always spot on, the entertainment is always happy and fun. Never a dull moment. The bar is great too. They are quick to get you your drinks and you definitely feel like you are getting what you pay for.  Fun Fact: For as long as I've been coming here (almost 7 years now), you can catch the cute little Asian lady there, in front, dancing and singing their songs. I pretty sure she is there every night and it is the most amazing thing you will ever see in your life. I'm not sure she knows the words to the songs but she plays it off well. Love her!  Enjoy!",

We went here on a Saturday night and although we had made a reservation we had to wait a little while.  In the end we didn't mind because of the live music. It adds to the festive atmosphere.   The food: I had never really experienced Irish food, but the best explanation I could come up with was British food with extra flavor, so it was very delicious. The beer & cheese dip was amazing as was the crab cake. I ordered the chicken, which was a little dry and some bites were hard to get through. The mushroom and cheese cake that came with it was wonderful! Like a creamy and fluffy cheese muffin. Their drink selection was good, lots of good beers to choose from as well.

My pot pie was a little strange with a tomato broth, but it was overall very tasty. My husband didn't like the sauerkraut on his sandwich, but was happy other than that.  It was pretty quiet when we went at 11:15am on a Monday, so service was perfect and our food came out very quickly. I would definitely go back. I wanted to get dessert, but we were way too full.",

The house Irish band Sin E Ri-Ra is fantastic and really know how to get the energy and camaraderie going! It's a refreshing place to visit while in the land of cocaine and hookers, and one of the those fun places where you'll have made a dozen new friends by the time you stagger out the door.

Live Irish music coming from downstairs. A very bubbley, good-mood waitress (wish she had an Irish accent, if I'm honest), killer onion mashed potatoes and macaroni sides, I am having massive trouble remembering what my main dish was. If I remember it, I'll put it in.  4.5 stars really, because I found the food way too expensive for what it was. $91 for two people, even for Vegas, was much.  I'm kind of siding with the rest of my menagerie that was not as messed up: they all moaned and groaned in delight, and that affected, positively, my opinion of the place.  New York New York is not exactly my favorite Casino, or anything, but I am really glad I went here. I was fed well, albeit for a little too much money. Go with friends and try everything, you will be astonished by how comforting this food is.",

I had never been intimately involved with any one of Irish kin before so it was a new kind of culture I was being exposed to. There was an awesome band playing that night and the crowd and I were totally digging it. I also had a newfound love for cider which was all I drank when I came here. The upstairs bar and lounge area is really pretty in addition to the downstairs decor. It really feels like a True Irish pub. There was even a couple celebrating their marriage there that night and they were coming all the way from Ireland! And they were all smiling ear to ear so of course you know they should have great taste in an American Irish Pub. I didn't get to try any food, just had some drinks and enjoyed the music and danced all night. And lastly, might I say the best part of being here for me was falling in love.",

Drinks and everything else are great!  We ordered the Fish and Chips (typical white fish and good tartar sauce) and Steamed clams (in a tomato garlic sauce)... Both were good initially but moments after we had finished eating i felt sick to my stomach.  It's weird because we both shared food, but maybe one of my clams was bad? not sure.

We all fought over the appetizers of the beer and cheese dip and the battered and spicy sausages. Everyone loved what they ordered for dinner. I had the cider braised salmon (and I don't really like fish) and it was fantastic! I didn't hear any complaints around the table at all.

The music is mostly Irish folk songs and easily blended recent covers with a lovely young woman dancing traditional Irish dance on stage (her feet are dizzying fast.)

    "text": "The hubby and I came here for an earlier than early bird dinner on a quite Wednesday night.  I feel like when all these reviews I missed a good portion of what this place really had to offer, still I had a great dinner.  Half the place looked closed down and the upstairs area was roped off.  The stage was closed down with a projected basketball game going on in the pub area.  We were seated towards the back in a little kitchy table that was one half love seat, one half dining table.  I loved all the stuff hanging from the walls.  While we were near the bar it seemed very cozy.    After a few late lunch crowd folks finished up we had the dining room to ourselves.  Hubby had the fish and chips and I ordered the Shepard's pie.  The server asked if I wanted the Irish cheese on top and even though I'm not a big cheese fan I said yes.  I'm so glad she asked because it was so good taking big fork fulls of the gooey cheese out of the little tin pot it comes in.  The serving itself was quite large and because it was so good I wish I could have finished it.  Even with the human vacuum cleaner with me, we still couldn't get to the bottom of it.  If you order appetizers, the Shepard's pie could be split and both people could be well fed.  I would definitely come back to this place just because of the pie.  Service was really great too.  It was about 60 bucks for the two of us, with tip and drinks without an appetizer.  Well worth the price.",

I also recommend the buffalo wings but get the sauce on the side. It is definitely one of the best in Vegas. It is cooked right, the skin is very crispy which I like.",

We ordered a Potato Basket (Rustic fried potato slices with sides of red and yellow curry dipping sauces) to start off with. The red sauce was good, but the yellow curry dipping sauces was awesome!  My girlfriend ordered the Irish Banger (Traditional Irish sausage on mustard mashed potatoes with mushroom jus) and I ordered the Lamb Stew (Lamb with potatoes and vegetables in a traditional broth) with Irish chips & Sauteed peas on the side.  Both dishes were superb, as were the sides.   Not having a baseline nor a clue on what \"Traditional\" Irish food, we don't know how it compares, but we were more than happy with our experience.   The service was great, we were seated quickly (it was early evening), and the all the food was good.  I do plan on visiting again when I come back to Vegas to pick-up my daughter.",

A great menu with lots of choices and a fun atmosphere made it a great evening out!  The decor is  fun and very Irish, the staff are helpful and attentive, the prices not bad for a Vegas spot.

    "text": "I usually only use Yelp as a place to rave about places I love, but, in this case, I feel I need to use it as a warning. My husband and I went to Nine Fine Irishmen on July 5. I ordered the lamb stew and a glass of water, and my husband ordered the shepherd's pie and a glass of Guinness. We're were both a little put off that the food came in dented metal bucket's and both commented how my stew was more of a soup with a watery broth, but the food smelled good so we ate it. My stew did taste good. Another off-putting thing was that the dim lights made me mistake a large chunk of \"something\" for cauliflower. It was not cauliflower. Whatever it was dissolved as soon as I closed my mouth, so I couldn't even spit it out. Still, nothing was too bad, probably a three star rating experience. Then, I woke up at about 4 am with horrible sharp pains in my stomach, followed by hours of all the disgusting symptoms of food poisoning. Thankfully, we are here visiting my parents, so I spent my sickness at my parents' home and not a hotel. Still, food poisoning is a terrible thing. I spent half of the day incredibly sick to the point where I was so dehydrated that my hands and feet cramped into painful immovable positions, and I had to be feed ice chips of Pedialyte to rehydrate me because I couldn't even keep down fluids. I have never been that sick before in my life.",

Overall I was not impressed by the food or the beer (after all it is beer you can get at other places even if it is a good selection).  BUT, the reason that this place gets 5 stars from me (not a common thing) was the band. Sin e Ri Ra was outstanding.  The music was amazing and the woman they have performing traditional irish step dancing while they play is great.  The entertainment at this place was top notch.  I would have paid just to see them perform and they are the highlight of the bar and the only real reason I would return.",

We had fun. I wish they would leave the upstairs open when it gets a bit packed. wearing high heels all night, it would have been nice to sit down for a bit. There was a group of very noticeable rowdy guys and no one did anything or asked them to calm down, it eventually got very annoying and we left. The staff is \"cold\" and humorless- almost seemed stressed. nonetheless, when they have the dancer- it really adds to the experience! Worth a try and something to tick off the list.",

We all had a great time dancing to the live band who did covers and classic Irish songs, as well as chatting with the other patrons in the bar that night (it was not super crowded since it was a Tuesday). I really do believe that people who go to Irish pubs are some of the friendliest people around! A round of four beers with tax and tip ran me about $40 which was not too bad in my eyes since we were getting Guinness, Harp, and Smithwicks.

Lots of food and very delicious. Drinks were very well priced for the location.   Only complaint is that a side is not included which is silly but I had no regrets once the plate was delivered. Would certainly recommend",

They were playing the soccer game which was a huge plus! Our server wasn't in a big hurry, but we weren't either, and she was extremely friendly. It was a tough choice between the shepherds pie and the braised ribs. I ordered the Guinness braised ribs, and my friend ordered the corned beef and cabbage. The ribs were flavorful and very tender, and one of the best things I ate during my stay in Vegas. If you're looking for something different than the steakhouses and burger joints, give this place a try!",

We had passed Nine Fine Irishmen the night before so we walked over and arrived just in time for dinner. There were only 5 minutes left on happy hour so we ordered a couple pints. The server was absolutely wonderful and helpful when it came to making suggestions and even let me get another pint on the happy hour price, despite it being twenty minutes late. The shepherd's pie was incredible, the best I've ever tasted. I had the steak with macaroni and cheese and garlic mashed potatoes. Everything was portioned enormously and tasted so incredible that I wanted to stop eating but really, I couldn't. The outside patio seating is nice and casual, and the inside seating is dimly lit and nicer. We will definitely be back here next time we are in Vegas!",

Good Irish music playing in the background, but not so loud you can't have a conversation.    First time I went we had a full meal (appetizers, drinks, entrees, and dessert).  The meal was good but the appetizers and drinks were the standouts.  When I go back, we just do appetizers and drinks.  The things we keep going back for are the Beer and Cheese Dip and the Irish Nachos both are phenomenal.  I have looked high and low for the recipe for the Beer and Cheese Dip or something similar but nothing comes close.",

    "text": "I have visited this restaurant twice and I'm surprised to find that I did not review them the first time, which is unfortunate because the first visit was stellar.  That was about a year ago and the service was awesome, as was the food.  We fell in love with the beer cheese dip with different breads, including some phenomenal pretzel rolls and told everyone that they had to go to this place.  That's why I'm surprised I failed to actually write the review!  Unfortunately, this recent experience was really different.  My husband and I brought my parents here for dinner on Sunday night for fish and chips and OF COURSE we ordered the beer cheese dip.  Everything started out pleasant but when the beer cheese dip arrived it was lukewarm and all of the breads were kind of hard.  I'm not much of a complainer these days and my husband was sort of saying it wasn't hot when the server walked up.  Monica overheard and asked if there was something wrong.  He told her that it wasn't hot and she offered to bring another.  I said, it was fine because it was warm, just not hot and not to worry about it.  That was before I realized the bread was also not very fresh.  But, I'd made my bed.  We munched on the bread and were chatting and the football game that was on the big screen next to us ended, so my husband asked a server who was passing by if they could change it to the last few minutes of the Cowboy game, she was saying that they didn't have the football package when our main server, Monica came out and agreed that they don't have a Football package.  My husband said, \"it's on regular TV.\" and Monica got an odd look on her face and said, \"Sir, I don't know why you're so upset.  I can look into it.\"  We were all a little confused because my husband wasn't upset at all, but instead just stated a fact.  She said, \"we don't have that and I can't change it and walked off.\"  It was one of the weirdest experiences with a server because everyone was happy and having a good time and he just made a request that you might make in any bar.   That sort of set the stage for the rest of the meal and while the fish and chips were good, after that the experience was awkward.  We probably would have just let it go, but then the manager stopped by and asked how our meal was, so we told her what had happened and instead of just apologizing and saying she would talk to the server, she started defending the server by saying we don't have the football packages, etc. etc.  THAT was weird, too.  It was never about that, it was the weird response and awkward service.  The manager did offer to remove the cheese dip from our bill and we hadn't eaten it all so it was pretty clear that it wasn't that great and we accepted her offer.    Overall, it was a strange experience. I think it was the only time I've ever worried that something might get hinky with my food because a server was mad at us.  Super awkward and uncomfortable and I'm bummed because I really liked that place.  It is unlikely we will return to NFI because of it, because my husband is pretty darn unhappy.",

Our server (Tracy, I think) was really nice and attentive without being cloying. The food was very good. Started with deep fried pickles, which I had never eaten before. Really liked them! They were served with a house made tartar sauce, but they also make a really great ranch dressing and will bring that on request, too. Not sure which one I liked better! One person in our party had the Irish Stew, and it was pretty good. 2 of us had the pork chop special, which was really great. One had the salmon. Everyone was pretty happy with what they ordered. For dessert, we had the Bailey's Coffee cake which was very much like a Tiramisu, but with Bailey's. It was delicious.",

There was a cover to get in, $5 standing room on the bar side or $15 to be seated at a table (per person). Drinks were about an average of $10 each (we had a combo of mixed drinks and beer). Definitely would go back again.",

The beer cheese is out of this world good.  For dinner we have had the Pork Chops and the stuffing is so good!  The lamb chops are tender and beautifully cooked.  The fish and chips are a classic and done very well.  The bangers are definitely worthy as well. We love Bailey's and their Bailey's Creme Brulee as well as there  Coffee Cake is so good.  The Lunch/breakfast menu is worth the trip for a late breakfast/early lunch.  The traditional breakfast is wonderful and filling.  You also can't go wrong with the Shepard's Pie or the chicken curry.  NFI also has a nice kids menu. The burger off the kids menu is huge and delicious.  We highly recommend a trip here.  If you play myVegas, look for the reward for here as it can easily help you save money.  If you have an MLife card, make sure you earn your points!",

The steak was so tender and the mac and cheese were the best we ever had..up to the point because another place one up them. This is an irish pub in Vegas so be prepared for the drunk people lounging around and expensive prices. There were men in skirts...I mean kilts there and they even had a dancer on the stage jumping up and down...very old school irish. Very good food..period\"  She said, \"yeah we didnt expect to eat at this place, but it was the closet place we could find. No regrets at all, we were really suprised by the food. Everything was amazing, my boyfriend and i split the rib eye and mac and cheese, it was sooooo good and especailly for midnight food. We figured since it was really late it wouldnt come out that good, but it came right from the oven/grill. It was very good. Again, an irish old school pub and resturaunt but you would be very suprised by their food :0)",

There couldn't be a more Disneyfied Irish Pub in all the world; everything seemed really clean and new, it didn't reek of urine, and the barmaids wear Lord of the Dance costumes.  But it was somewhat charming.   The bartenders told us about different whiskeys and gave us some good recommendations of places to go (and not to bother with) in Vegas.  Minus one star because for some reason we couldn't smoke at the bar upstairs (no smoking?? in Vegas??). I don't really like Ny,Ny (way too many kids), but if you find yourself there to ride the roller coaster this place is worth a visit.",

    "text": "So due to a mechanical problem, my flight from Vegas to LA was delayed and I was stuck in the city of sin for a night. Big bummer, huh? My BFF and I decided to take advantage of our luckiness and make it a night to remember, even though it was a Monday. That's how we do.  We have friends that RAVE about Nine Fine, but we both had never been there. I love NYNY and I had loved the Big Apple Bar, which is now being turned into a money cage. Boo. But we decided to venture into Nine Fine...and what fun it was!  We were hungry, but we arrived after the kitchen closed, so we decided to have a drink or two and then go find food. I really liked the atmosphere of the place. I'm quite familiar with pubs, especially as BFF's dad has worked for Guinness for 20+ years, and this place looks authentic! We went upstairs to the bar and were greeted immediately. The bartenders were pleasant, and while our first drinks were not strong, they were decent.  Then we moved on to apple martinis (I know, in an Irish pub, but whatever!). Soon they asked us to move downstairs, as they were closing the upstairs part. No prob.  Downstairs was a lively Irish band (I think they are called Ri-Ra or something like that). Although it was not packed, it was busy enough and soon people were dancing. It was really fun. BFF and I began drinking \"Drunken Peaches\" from the speciality cocktail menu. At $10, they were really strong, but sweet and delicious. We really liked taking our cocktails outside to the large patio. At 12am, on a Monday/Tuesday in February, the Strip was pretty much a ghost town. It was a cool experience.   I will be back for sure!",

They have the busts of the nine Irishmen prominently displayed in the bar, likely to avoid stupid questions, although i like that the concept of the bar goes beyond just the name.  The place kind of seems like your typical counterfeit Irish pub type place but I have to give this place credit.  They have Boru (Irish Vodka) available at the bar, not to mention the full array of Irish whiskeys we've all come to know, love and blame for hangovers.  Additionally, their bangers and mash and Shepard's pie are quite delicious and the presentations are straight Vegas.  The one knock, is that the place is designed a little oddly, so some of the spaces can seem very cramped, especially upstairs.  Also, this place used to feature authentic Irish music without breaking your wallet, now I've noticed some ridiculous $20 covers to get in and have a whiskey after 11pm.    Thus is the way of Vegas...",

Drinks are not cheap here. $7.50 a pint for Magners but  given the rarity of a bar actually having some one becomes accustomed to it.  Cider = works :)    Food regrettably is inconsistent. The appetizers are big enough for two but both the potato chips and curry and the bread with melted cheese  are heavily biased in the favor of dipping items to sauce. In the potato wedge case you can barely fit the dam thing in the small, They were on the whole good enough.   My main meal of bangers and mash with mushroom gravy was surprisingly good it's hard to mess that up. Sadly my wifes \"brie-stuffed\" chicken was a dry as hell cheese under the skin concoction that was really light on the featured ingredient. They are either losing it all in the cooking  or more realistically they are being miserable bastards with it.  This dish accompanied by awful potatoes, additional charge, that were way runny .   You can tell a place that gives not a crap by the way they don't inquire about the fact that you are paying $20 for food that remains uneaten, surely that's about the biggest clue your customer could give you?  On the whole  inconsistent quality with pricing that would suggest otherwise.",

The bar is gorgeous - with everything shipped in from Ireland, it's as authentic as you can get state side. So much so that I felt weird ordering car bombs, but the waitress didn't blink. The inside is very charming, the outdoor patio less so (but drinking outside in the sun is awesome). I ate here a few different times and the food is tasty (but expensive like everything in Las Vegas). The goat cheese salad was very good - fresh arugula, wonderfully caramelized onions, and amazing marinated tomatoes that really put the salad over the top. The Irish Nachos are quite good too and make a perfect bar snack. Beers are $7.50 which seemed a little much to me. And they charge an \"entertainment tax\" which was more than the sales tax...so remember your meal is going to cost like 40% more once sales tax, entertainment tax, and tip is added in.",

The food is very good and since we were with a large party we pretty much got to try everything and everyone was happy with their selection. Upstairs the have more private seating areas. We got a table that was very private but not so much that we felt isolated. The manager even stopped by to check on us.   For me this place is a must go to place when in vegas.   Don't eat before you go if you want to be seated at a table. They only seat people if you are ordering food. Everyone else has to fend for themselves in the bar. We actually hung out in the bar after we ate because by then they had live entertainment. So if you already ate, just do that.",

I wasn't too hungry, but decided to split a few appetizers and drinks with my friend.  We were there around 10pm, so the band was playing and they even had an Irish Stepdancer to perform, which was awesome.  (Always had an admiration for them!)    We split the Drunken Onion Rings and the Steak and Stout Pies.  Both were absolutely DELICIOUS!  The onion rings didn't really show the bloody mary flavor, but they were some of the best I've ever eaten.  And the Steak & Stout pies I would definitely get again.    Service was great -- our server was attentive and friendly.   I would come here again!  It's a really fun atmosphere!",

I spent my 21st birthday in Las Vegas with my family, and when my siblings asked me where I wanted to go, I said \"There's this pub at the New York, New York that I've been wanting to check out.\"   As I was entering, my brother paid the bouncer for my entrance while he looked at my ID. I then noticed he raised an eyebrow, and he said to me \"Since it's your birthday, I'll let you in for free. Happy Birthday, and enjoy your time.\" I gave him a hearty thank you and proceeded inside with my siblings.   The decor is really nice, and looked authentically Irish. There was an Irish Folk band playing (their name is \"Sin e Ri Ra.\" Check them out on YouTube!), and it immediately got me in the mood for some brews. After a couple of drinks and some great music, everyone was having a great time. My sister-in-law was dancing with an awesome Asian leprechaun lady, everyone sang along to Finnegan's Wake, and there was even a dude wearing sunglasses in the dark and dancing a jig, all while holding a beer in his hand, no less. All in all, the headache I had the next morning was well worth it. 4 1/2 stars!",

As far as the Irish feel this place definitely came through.  Dining inside we actually forgot we were in Vegas for a second and were in a old school pub in Ireland instead.  The Guinness beer on tap  is a winner.  Having a couple of pints, I also ordered ale battered and spicy sausages.  What's better than fried sausages?  Heart attack paradise anyone?  Kidding a side.  They were awesome. Second time we dined here.  I pretty much had the same thing.  I did have a different variation of Guinness though.  This time I had Guinness with a blond ale.  It was called a Yellow Jacket.  So good, I had another.  Besides a different variation of my drink choice.  We sat outside on the patio facing the main strip.  Not so much the Irish feel but still a good time onlooking Las Vegas Boulevard, the bright lights and people partying.  They also had a live band playing Irish folk music that night.  You could hear the music out on the street.  Something about Irish music that puts you in the mood to drink Guinness and get rowdy.  Definitely the next time we are in Vegas.  We are coming to the Nine Fine Irishmen again.  This place is a real Irish pub in the middle of the Vegas strip.",

HMMM.....just like that relationship, Nine Fine Irishmen left me...totally dissatisfied. The idea is right but just poorly executed.   We ordered the Curry Chicken Salad Sandwich and the Fish and chips...The Curry Chicken was in one word: weird. Texturally, like eating paper mache with chunks of raisins in it. PUKE. My fish and chips were soggy and miserable. UGGGG. Susan and I ended up pushing our plates away. The only dish that kept us from walking out was the Beer Cheese Dip that we ordered. It was cheesy and tasty and had bread, crackers and breadsticks to dip.   All in all-we spent $75 for cheese dip. Ridiculously a waste of money and time. A pretty cool looking pub to take some snaps but I would never suggest eating here.",

The restaurant is in the New York New York hotel right on Las Vegas Blvd. They have outdoor dining that is shaded in the evening. Service was good and the food was great. We had the mixed green salad which was very good. The chicken pot pie (which they can make vegetarian if you ask), mac n cheese, and goat cheese mashed potatoes. All of it very good. We will probably go here at least once on our future trips. Also saw on the way out, some tables have a beer tap at the table so you can fill up you glasses yourself. A meter keeps track of how much you serve yourselves.   If you are driving there you can use the same self parking for the casino. Valet parking is available also. If you are staying near Tropicana and Las Vegas Blvd. walking would be best in most situations.",

    "text": "Came here for an early dinner based on the raving Yelp reviews and menu (online). We were majorly disappointed. Service and initial food rating would have been 2 stars, but factor in food infection, they get 1 star by default because ZERO is not an option. Their current menu is also different from what they post on their website...Patty said the website hasn't been updated yet. Read on for explanation and details.  We were greeted and seated promptly, so things started off promising. About 5 minutes after seating, the waitress (Patty) attended to another nearby table and then said to us that she'd be right back to take our drink orders. 10 mins later, we contemplated leaving...15 min wait just for a drink order is ridiculous! And the restaurant wasn't very busy. She finally took our drink order, so we stayed and gave her the benefit of the doubt because the reviews were good. Patty's service was very slow and lacking throughout our dinner. She had a limp and seemed like she was trying to attend to all her tables at the same time regardless of when they were seated to save herself from walking back and forth. The table next to us came in 15 mins after us and had their drink and meal order taken at the same time as us. Patty even asked them how their meal was about half way through their meal but didn't stop by to ask us the same. The only thing she moved fast on was getting us the check and closing out our ticket. Patty was lucky that my Mom paid and was nice to give her a decent tip. I would have given a dollar.  Food was okay...the best was the mac & cheese and the grilled asparagus sides. We also had: - chicken pot pie...creamy tomato base was different and just okay. - tossed green salad with chicken...just okay, nothing special. - rib-eye steak...no seasoning and tasted okay (read more on this below).  Initially I would have given 2 stars for food and service, but after my partner got sick (food infection, possibly caused by Salmonellosis, causing vomiting and diarrhea) from the steak, I'd give ZERO stars. Granted, she asked for her steak to be rare, meat is supposed to be properly stored at the correct temperature and dated to ensure freshness. The steak did not taste \"off\".....I had a small bite but didn't get sick. The cut and quality of the meat seemed fine, but nothing spectacular and definitely not worth the $27 price.  From our experience, we completely disagree with most of the Yelpers this time and will never be eating here again. We probably would have been better off eating at the American restaurant with a NY strip and crab legs special for $14.99.",

The huge vaulted ceiling and the beautiful chandeliers really add personality to this pub (despite the fact that it is located inside a casino in Las Vegas).   The live music, especially when it is traditional Irish music, is phenomenal. There was a wonderful Irish band playing the night we were there. They were from Ireland and I had the chance to talk to them. They were extremely friendly and engaging with the crowd. They took song requests and played all sorts of traditional Irish music as well as some modern American favorites (such as \"Wagon Wheel\").  So if you are looking to avoid the typical crowded, overwhelming Las Vegas bar, or even worse club, come to Nine Fine Irishmen. You'll be glad you did.",

I usually visit for a late dinner so I have a table to hear the live music and see the Irish dancer(s)at 9pm, otherwise there is a $5 cover charge. They serve the typical Irish pub grub for lunch and dinner. I usually have their awesome fish & chips, but decided to have the shepherds pie instead. My wife had the baked salmon with vegetables. Both meals were very tasty. Besides pints of Guinness and wine, we had a delicious Michael Collins cocktail. This place is a little pricey, but then again this Vegas!",

We were sat immediately at a table on the second level that overlooked the bar. It was a perfect spot for people watching. We ordered drinks and appetizers and they were fantastic. There is a cool story about the 9 brothers that our waitress told us about. It was charming. With a last name of Duffy from Boston, my husband was sold. Hahaha! The band that played was pretty authentic and it reminded us of places in the South End of Boston!  We left just as it began to get crowded, but it really had a nice vibe to it and it stood out as a distinct and interesting place to visit. I highly recommend!",

It definitely isn't the worst option if you are staying at The New York New York, but it isn't among the best that Vegas has to offer.   We started with the beer n' cheese dip. It was gooey and yummy at first, but quickly became too rich. I had the shepard's pie which sounded very tasty from the description, but wasn't all that flavorful. It wasn't tempting to keep eating. My husband had the salmon and that came with a nice seasoning and sauce. His dish was pretty good.   There aren't a ton of Irish food options in Vegas so I'll probably be back at some point. It definitely wasn't a restaurant I'd write off and I'd probably come back to try some other food items.",

Irish bacon reminded me of \"Canadian\" bacon.   They seemed to be on a wait most days, so prepare to put your name in and wander around.   Really loved their steemer clams!  Cons: I thought the shepherd's pie needed more flavor and it was pretty dry. It was mostly mashed potato. I asked for a side of au jus and they helped. The breakfast hash and bacon was also crazy salty.   Overall it was good and I'd be back!",

Be warned that the salads here are pretty hefty and there is no option to get a half, which was a bummer. But everything tasted fresh, crisp and good. The only complaint I had about the salad was that there was only a minimal amount of goat cheese sprinkled in. However, as soon as I pointed this out to my server, he came out with a huge side of goat cheese so I could indulge to my heart's desire - awesome service.   Beer options are sort of limited here, nothing special on the rotation. I decided to go with an Elysian Space Dust which was decent to wash everything down with.",

The prices here are also super cheap for the strip. I've been coming here for years and will stay at the New York New York just to be close to this bar.",

As Irish as an Irish pubby restaurant can be inside of a NY themed hotel and casino at the corner of Trop and Blvd in the Mojave desert.  I love the decor and story behind Nine Fine Irishman.  So....on the most recent visit, my buddy and I sat at the bar upstairs.  The service was attentive as we drank some Magners Original Irish Cider and ordered up not one....but two helping of the delicious Irish Nachos.  Delicious!

We sat outside on the patio and I guess the really out-of-towners don't get the idea of misters on the patio.   This amazing idea drops the outside temp to really comfortable. But as has happened other patios we've found, folks will ask that they get turned off. Happened here too, but there was great beer and food in the offing so okay!  So couple of us had the fish and chips. Awesomely prepared and perfectly seasoned - their rendition of tartar sauce......deeelish!  I asked for more. Black and Tan was a perfect beverage!    One of our folks got the shepherds pie. It looked great and was presented in a very cool pot kinda dish. Very cool and he said it was awesome.   Service was just great right up to the end. Although our waitress was excellent and given how pleasant the meal was to that point, we would have loved to have another drink, someone who appeared to be a manager was on the patio hustling people out even though there was no crowd or queue. Wasn't just us either.   Thought that was odd since we were clearly more than happy to be there and comfortable.  This and the mister shut down caused some star loss this time!",

Having an oke, mediocre experience.   Mediocre because of the service and the food. Nothing bad, nothing worth remembering or coming back for. We even ended up bringing our money to the front because after bringing the check it was over with the attention. We've waited for 10 minutes and than left. Luckily we had enough and the proper amount of cash money.  My love choose the chicken pot pie and I ordered the lamb stew. Both oke dishes served really, really hot. Portions we're big.

And the service, while friendly, was very slow on delivering the food.  Ordered battered sausage and onion rings for apps - both were very good.  For entrees, shepherd's pie and herb crusted arugula and goat cheese salad with shrimp.  Shepherd's pie was a large portion (good), with great mashed on top but the meat was dry - no gravy!?  If it had some moisture to it, it would have actually been a really good shepherd's pie....  The shrimp on the salad was tough and overcooked (re-heated??).  Seemed like they had been sitting around too long or had been cooked the day before.  Ordered a Stoli and tonic but somehow got a Smirnoff and tonic (shown on the bill).  Perhaps it is unfair to expect to have great pub food in LV...but it's such straightforward and simple food, I would have thought it would have been a no-brainer.  Maybe Ri-Ra would have been a solid bet because it is a chain...but I will get my pub food at Olde Blind Dog in ATL :)  Atmosphere was fantastic and authentic....I am sure the live music is a good time too.",

But hey you are on the strip so what do you expect. Beers 8 bucks and meals 20 plus. I can go off strip and save a ment.   I drank a cider beer most of the night. It was from the tap and needed more bubbles. Wasn't flat but was full flavor either.   I also had the chicken pot pie. This I would recommend. It might have been the best Chicken pot pie I have ever had. Better have been for 20 bucks.   The atmosphere was cool. Being on the strip drinking and having a good time was fun. They even had an irish band playing that night.   I would go back but only if it was at the request of someones special occasion. Everything here was just too overpriced for me.",

I WANTED the shepherds pie but again given that we didn't want to eat too much we ordered the onion rings and the Beer Cheese dip.    Impulsively I ordered a Guinness and it was not until later that I realized that this place knows the difference between a Black and Tan (Guinness and Bass) and a Half and Half (Guinness and Harp) knowing the difference makes all of the difference in the world to an Irish Pub Snob like me.    The onion rings were VERY good and I believe made with their Bloody Mayr mix.  The Beer Cheese dip... lets just say... that was fantastic!  served with a verity of breads and what appeared to be a bit of a Parmesan crust on top of the dip, it was heavenly.  And here's the thing... I really don't like chess all that much, this was something my wife ordered.    Despite being in a Las Vegas Casino the place had a warm and cozy feeling to it and inspired talk of opening up our own pub when we retire.",

We were greeted quickly when we arrived and were seated at a nice table at the top of the stairs.  The waitress was friendly and brought our drinks with a short wait.  We ordered the fixed holiday menu but asked to start with an appetizer.  After a fairly long wait our salad and soup arrived .....before the appetizer.  When I pointed out to the server that we had not gotten our appetizer he checked his tray and said oh...here it is too. He was indifferent bordering on rude.   So, our casual dinner now has the appetizer and soup/salad on the table.  We started eating and after about five minutes the server shows up again....with our entrees.  His comment - so were am I supposed to put this.  My first thought is to send it back because we just got two other courses but based on his surly attitude (....I can only imagine what treatment that food would be given in the kitchen,,,,,) I told him to put it on the corner of the table.  The waitress came by and I told her I felt rushed and could not understand why the courses were coming out all togther.  She was polite and apologized.  We finished the dishes and  the waitress returned to get our choices for dessert - which was included in the holiday menu.  They were out of one of the two selections and they let me substitute a regular menu item because I AM NOT a fan of pumpkin pie.  I was happy with my chocolate cake choice because the pumpkin pie looked dry and .....old.... when they brought my husband's dessert.  We ate so quickly I barely finished my one glass of hard cider.    Not sure if they were just trying to hurry up diners and turn over more tables or there was miscommunication in the kitchen - but this was a less than pleasant visit.  I guess I got coal in my Christmas stocking from the Nine Fine Irishmen.",

What makes Nine Fine Irishmen noteworthy is the layout of the two tiered space.  The restaurant is tightly laid out with tables close to one another.  From the second level, diners look down on the gorgeous bar and the busts of nine Irishmen--nine Irish revolutionaries from the 19th century.    The other thing that sets Nine Fine Irishmen apart is the fabulous selection of Irish whiskeys available behind the bar.  The early Irish referred to whiskey as \"The Water Of Life\".

Food is pricey but everything in Vegas costs money.  The bar even has partitions just like in Ireland shielding you from your neighbors.  The beer selection is excellent.  Nice and cold, and served in Imperial pint glasses.  The bar tenders are fast on the draw when your pint is almost empty.    Downsides, for dinner it's very LOUD with bands cranking out tunes while you eat.  Don't expect to have a quiet, intimate conversation.  But, when your sitting at the bar, the sound is fine.  The service is excellent.  We saw two different bands from Ireland and the place was packed but not overcrowded.  $5 dollar cover charge to get in when the bands were playing.  Overall, pretty good for dining if you want traditional Irish food and excellent for drinking!",

The fish had a nice batter and was great in the tartar sauce.  Although they only give you one small dipping portion, so another needed to be requested.   The band that plays nights on weekends is fantastic !!!",

The restaurant/bar is a maze of rooms that have you feeling like you're sitting in an old Irish country place of some kind. When they have the live Irish music going on this place gets really wild and is nearly impossible to get in, let alone trying to navigate through the maze of rooms. I have to admit that the staff could use a customer service injection, but maybe they're all just hung over from the non-stop partying going on at this place.",

Unfortunately their $5 drafts are only Mon-Thurs, so when we tried to go back Fri to hit it up again, we ended up paying full price for our beers, which was a bummer.    The place manages to keep the Irish pub atmosphere even while being smack in the middle of the New York New York casino, and was a great place to just throw back pints.  A fun side note - I told my boss today about having gone to this pub while on my trip and come to find out when he went to Vegas a few months ago, he actually did a jig on one of the tables and kissed the stuffed moose on the second floor.  God I wish I had seen that.",

    "text": "Nine Fine Irishmen is one of my favorite restaurants/pubs in Las Vegas! If there is somewhere I could go everyday of my life, it would be this pub. I cannot say enough incredible things about this restaurant to do it justice.  My boyfriend and I have been here several times, the first time being one year before we moved to Vegas from Chicago. Coming from a city filled to the brim with Irish Pubs (our favorite is Celtic Crossing downtown), we searched high and low for a great pub to relax and have some Guinness. Nine Fine Irishmen was perfect on many different levels.   1. They have a gluten-free menu. I'm not talking about a junk gluten-free menu that has you substitute or remove certain parts of a dish and are flavorless yet expensive. This gluten-free menu IS THE BEST! Sheperd's Pie? Gluten-free. Seafood Chowder (another soup that finds its way into my food dreams at night)? Gluten-free. AMAZING SALMON SALAD - GLUTEN-FREE! The brie-stuffed chicken? Gluten-Free! JOY!  2. Live Irish Music. Need I say anything more? Good quality, authentic, Irish music including dancers and sometimes bagpipes. You can NEVER complain about this music, and it provides a nice background while sitting out on the patio watching the crowds go by.  3. Whiskey and Beer. Guinness on-tap AT THE TABLE. No further description necessary.  4. Service: Fantastic. Every single time. Friendly, informative and always attentive, even when they're busy at night. I've never had anything less than great service at NFI.  5. The BEST Jameson Martini I have ever had in my life. My boyfriend's family is Scottish (amongst other things), so the man loves his whiskey. When you take Jameson (one of my favorites), add some apple juice, a little pucker and one other ingredient, you get the ultimate mantini in martini form! You can be the most masculine man and still enjoy this FANTASTIC concotion without feeling even a bit feminine.   Bottom line? Go there. Now. Immediately. Do not pass go, just get a martini, sit on the patio listening to the live music and get fat and happy.",

    "text": "Other than the delicious wings, the food, service and ambiance were disappointing.  We sat outside, so missed the Irish experience. Loud pop music (though this is everywhere on the strip). We sat for 15 minutes before our server acknowledged us, then finally got our drink order taken. It was now 6:20 p.m. and we advised our server that we needed to be done by 7:30 for a show in the hotel (New York New York). We anticipated an hour and a half would be enough time for pub fare and a drink. We were wrong - should have known when it took so long to even get our drinks.  The baked brie was barely warmed. The cheese, in fact, was still hard and cold inside. The green beans were cold. My friends said their meals were just okay, even for pub fare. My wings, as I stated earlier, were excellent. Note that a meal does not include any sides (e.g. vegetable or otherwise - you get, say, a piece of salmon and that is all on you plate unless you pay for more). We were barely attended to during the meal and asked repeatedly for our bill.  It was after 7:30 and we were watching our server provide bills to customers who had arrived after us and also take new orders, though it wasn't particularly busy. I approached our server at the server's station to remind her that we needed our bill. She barked \"I'm doing the best I can\" at me. Yet still no bill.  We were a table of six. Not demanding, except for the need for our bill at the end. There is a gratuity of 18% added automatically if there is a table of six or more. That would be fine if we had good service and individual bills. The best she could do was subtotal into five. And there were errors, so check your bills carefully.   And then we ran to our show.",

    "text": "5 stars, because this is the place where my husband and I had our first date, back in 2005. So, how could it NOT get 5 stars!   Every time we're in Vegas, we always make sure to stop by Nine Fine Irishmen at least once, for old time's sake. And it's always consistently good. In fact, it's always just the same as we've left it - same house band, same menu, same drink prices. And to be honest, that's not a bad thing. We always know that we're going to enjoy ourselves, and relive fun moments from our past.   Drinks are somewhat pricey; it's Vegas. They do often measure their pours, though, which is annoying. The food is alright, but we don't come here to eat - we come to drink, soak up the atmosphere, and listen to the band. Since the band takes requests, one of our favorite activities is to play \"stump the band\" and request all of the obscure Irish songs we can think of. It's fun, though, when they actually know one!   The bartenders aren't really outgoing, but they do keep everyone well hydrated. The atmosphere isn't really like what you'd find in a pub IN Ireland (it's a little too upscale for that), but Nine Fine Irishmen still does a good job of creating a fun, pub atmosphere, and is a good change from the standard Vegas craziness. You definitely don't feel like you're in Las Vegas...until you step out the door! I prefer to sit at the bar downstairs, but the upstairs area is nice as well, especially if you're having a meal. Downstairs can get a bit rowdy and loud as the evening goes on.   I do have to admit that there's another pub in Vegas that has recently stolen my heart, but Nine Fine Irishmen will always be special to me, and I know each time we visit will be as good as the last. I'm already looking forward to the next time we stop in.",

    "text": "We were here just a few days ago celebrating our oldest daughter's 21st birthday.  It was our second visit and we had an even better time than visit #1.  Here's why:  1) On entering the manager greeted us, asked if our daughter was 21 and when she showed her id the manager gave her a hearty Happy Birthday and bought her first drink.  Awesome!  2) The layout - we scored sweet seats at the bar.  This section of seating had a floor-to-ceiling panel that separated us from the rest of the bar and gave us almost instant access to the very attentive bartender and kept us somewhat insulated from the next seat over group of ridiculous 20-something guys drinking Coronas.  Seriously??? All of the seating here is set up to provide a cozy, insulated table that seems to encourage settling in and staying for the evening.    3) The drinks - my husband is a beer fan (shocking, I know) and I'm neutral but I love an occasional Harp and can't usually find it on tap at home.  The 21yo started with her on-the-manager shandy and followed up with an ice cold hard cider.  Hubs had black and tans all night.    4) The food - just before the kitchen closed we ordered shepard's pies.  Served in a cast metal bucket these we the largest shepard's pies I've ever seen!  Two were more than enough for our whole party.  The flavor and texture were excellent!  I want one now, in fact.  No noticeable veggies in there but that might have been the low lighting and the beer, not the pies themselves.  :)  5) The band - Sin E Ri-Ra is apparently the house band and they were fantastic!  I'm not a huge fan of Irish music but everything they played was awesome and I've still got one of the songs (Whiskey in the Jar) stuck in my head three days later.  I'm contemplating tracking down one of their CDs.    6) The little old lady with the cane - I'm pretty sure she was there last time, too.  I don't know who this woman is but she had a following of her own and was getting right down with the music all night.  Adorbs.  Unlike some of the other reviewers here we ARE fans of the pub aesthetic.  At it's most authentic it is a gathering place for the neighborhood, men, women, families and friends.  It is a place where you spend hours just hanging out, drinking, talking and listening to music, with people whose company you enjoy.  It's simple, homey and comfortable.  If that's not what you're looking for, don't bother.  If it is, Nine Fine Irishmen nails the experience flawlessly.    Cheers to you, NFI, and we raise a glass to your health!!!",

We usually get five or six rooms at NYNY, spend almost all of our time there, and listen to the band play until 2:30 am while we gamble our money away drunk on Guinness, but we are not staying or playing at NYNY if an Irish band isn't playing in the Irish pub- it just doesn't make sense! There are already lots of options for run-of-the mill pop and R&B music around Vegas. BRING BACK THE IRISH BAND!",

We waited at our table for 20 minutes and we sat at a table with the empty glasses from the previous customer and no one every came by!! We finally went to the bar and there were 2 bartenders and we were the only ones ordering a drink and we still had to wait 5 minutes for one of them to finally help us. I feel bad that I actually gave the guy tip :(",

    "text": "We sort of stumbled into Nine Fine Irishmen at New York New York on the Las Vegas strip and I was pleasantly surprised. It has plenty of seating, indoor and outdoor and a nice vibe about the place. The service is nothing to write home about for sure but luckily the food more than makes up for it. We started with the Colcannon Soup, which is sort of a potato and leak and bacon type soup. They put a dab of oil on top and the bacon gives it great texture. It really was very satisfying and could be a meal all by itself. I was very impressed with the complexity of flavor and execution on that soup.   My entree was the Guinness Braised Short Ribs. Also very well prepared and flavorful. It could've done for another textural aspect to kick it up a notch but overall a satisfying meal. I would definitely go back. The dessert menu looked appealing (next time!)",

We sat upstairs, it wasn't very crowded for Mother's Day which was slightly surprising. We ordered baked Brie, Sheppards pie & The bone in NY strip with blue cheese & Jameson peppercorn demi-glaze (or however you spell it)   The Brie was delicious but not super hot just warm enough to be melty, I figured the puff pastry would be burnt if it has been baked any longer. My mom loved her bucket of sheppards pie, it's not my thing so I didn't try it. My first steak was medium well when I ordered it medium rare, (i knew this was not my servers fault).. they made a new one which came out perfect.   Our server was super informative and helpful, i asked a ton of questions about certain dishes because I can be kinda picky, I have a 7 month old and was also kind of needy, he was patient and kind, helped with recommendations as well as answered my questions.. I can't remember his name but he was from the Washington DC area and I related because I am as well even though we are locals now..",

Reserving a table online was quick and easy and we headed over to New York, New York right before our scheduled time.  I'll be honest, I didn't have high expectations before we came here. I was expecting this place to be overrated and overpriced like most restaurants in Las Vegas. I was wrong! I got the lamb stew which tasted incredible; even my boyfriend was jealous of what I got. He got Shepherd's Pie, which was also really good. As a starter, we got Fried Pickles; I don't think these are \"Irish\" but they were yummy!  Our server was really nice and very helpful in telling us what was good and what we should get. And when we got here it wasn't too crowded at all.  Definitely a recommend in my book.

My partner is quite fond of Whisky (and whiskey) and they have a good selection and good at a recommendation when you need it, I don't drink but if you're like me you can enjoy the bread and cheese thing whose name escapes me but trust me it's there on them menu but all the food we've had there is quite good and they have live music too. Also have to point out some of the friendliest staff of any place I've been to in Vegas. So I guess I can conclude by saying this is one thing that makes visiting that town totally worth it.",

We are generally reasonable people and understand that sometimes people make mistakes. It seems pretty likely that either she forgot to enter the order or something went wrong in the kitchen. Look, if this happens just own up to the mistake! Don't leave your guests hanging.   She did not even approach our table again until we had our food.

So we get a table because we are hungry and wait 15 minutes and nobody comes.  We get pissed off and go to the second floor bar to at least get a drink and realize that it is empty and can get food there so we just migrate there.  From here on out it was a great experience and the bartender was fantastic and filled with some good Irish crack.

The pork chop was so good I wanted to gnaw on the bone (no, I didn't do it, but I did put a lot of effort into cutting as much meat as possible off so none would go to waste.

It was like the skies opened and angels descended upon Las Vegas to deliver this delicacy to us. Seriously, it's heaven. The sauce is melty, cheesy goodness with a fantastic flavor that keeps you comin' back for more. That ridiculousness is then covered in cheese and buttery breadcrumbs and broiled to perfection. If I could have one thing to eat for the rest of my life, it would be this mac and cheese. If you're reading this, I hope it persuades to to order the mac and cheese.

Server was attentive and quick.   Both steaks were great. For the price it was excellent considering the steak houses around that are much more expensive. Perfectly cooked and seasoned. Got them both med rare and they came to the table med rare.   Sides were enough for 2. Rice was better than it looked. Grilled asparagus. Yum.   Top it off with a glass of Guinness.   Great meal, great service.   It was dark in the restaurant. Sorry the pictures came out dark.",

We ordered drinks, beer cheese dip and wings.  She actually sent someone back over to our table to move us to a different location because she didn't like our order.  What complete BS!  Terrible waitress that needs to be appreciative of people no matter how much they order.  We left.  The Manager apologized, but there was absolutely no way we were going to stay after that.  I am still in shock that she even has a job!  Responding to your message below - the Assistant Manager Damon Knowlton apologized after I explained how awful we were treated.  I should've gotten her name but didn't waste my time.  We were sitting right in front of the stage around 8:30 last night.",

    "text": "I wasn't staying at New York New York but was just looking around the casino. It has a bar inside. Nine Fine Irishmen is one of the better casino bars on the Strip. It has reasonable prices. That's reason enough to go there.   I had a drink with a new friend. He said this is his favorite bar on the Strip. I was skeptical because it was in a casino and the glitzy resort casinos have a reputation for being expensive and not worth going to. It just happened to be the right time of day. Yes it was happy hour. It has good prices for a casino bar. Jameson is $5 at happy hour, and other simple cocktails cost about that much. The food is typical Irish stuff that's not vegetarian friendly, like bangers and mash, so I didn't order anything but I did see others get food and it all looked okay.   Nine Fine Irishmen is exactly that, fine. It has good Irish beer and cocktails. More importantly they're not crazy expensive even though it's in a huge resort.",

    "text": "You might not want to tell your S.O. that you've having nine fine Irish men for dinner. That might be interpreted the wrong way.   But these Irish men sure know their way to a girl's heart. The chicken pot pie had a nice flaky crust and a good amount of chicken chunks. The shepherd's pie came in a pail, which was very interesting and got us some funny looks from neighboring tables. Don't be deceived by how small the pail looks though, the food inside is very filling. 25% mashed potato, 75% beef filling. The mashed potatoes were creamy and fluffy and the beef filling was plentiful and flavorful. We also ordered the bangers and mash. The sausages were cooked perfectly on top of a bed of more of that lovely mashed potatoes. Nobody went home hungry that night.  For being on the strip, prices are as expected for the portions. They've also got a cool bar area and a really entertaining live band that are both fun to watch and listen to. If you play the myVegas game, you can often find promo deals to NFI.",

We were hoping to grab a table outside on the strip but, of course since the weather was perfect - it was packed & we didn't want to wait so we headed inside to the bar for some grub.  The bartenders we super friendly and quick with the booze! We split an order of mac & cheese and a Ruben sandwich with fries. Both were very good. Corned beef was super lean and tender, loaded with 1000, kraut, & melted provolone on toasted marble rye. The mac & cheese was crazy gooey goodness - almost too much cheese but, can there ever really be too much cheese? Awesome! We washed it all down with a couple of Magners and headed out the the casino floor to try our luck. Great place - we will be back on our next Vegas trip!!",

We sat outside at the bar and was fun people watching. They had a live band playing inside which was really good. The food was reasonably priced and was really good. The normal Mac and cheese was extremely cheesy, and yummy as was the fried Mac and cheese.

    "text": "I gotta say don't really know what the fuss about this place was I would give it a 2.5 nothing to special with the food and the service is pretty bad.     The main reason why I thought the service was bad is because when I first walked in in the afternoon I wanted to sit in the area outside the place there where two or three open tables. I was told they where reserved even though they sat completely empty the whole time I was there. So I went to the bar and ordered a drink and said I would order food. He said I would need my credit card. First time this has happened gave him my card. Ordered drinks and food and got to listen to the bartender and waitress talk about how horrible all the customers are which was pleasant.      Ordered the shepherds pie was kind of mediocre at best nothing to special. Was a little bit cold. The draft beers where kind of pricey but I guess it's vegas so  I can expect that. The bartender asked me if I needed anything else and I said no. So he hurried and rang my credit card before I could give him my mlife card. Didn't even see my receipt until after he ran. Kind of pissed me off so I won't be back. Really don't need to deal with rude people with poor service and mediocre food when I'm on vacation. There are better places to eat and drink inside NYNY so I'll go to those places",

In fact, we tried to raddle off our drink order, appetizer, and dinner order, all at the same time. Cheese dip with bread came before drinks. Finally after finishing our appetizer our drinks arrived. Drinks were great, but can't mess up a Jameson and ginger ale.  Dinner was good.. pot pie was tasty, fish n chips only comes with 2 pieces of fishes, soggy fries. The fish was great, fries were barf worthy.   Atmosphere in the bar is fun, however we were seated in a small back room for dinner, felt forgotten. Tracy's lack of enthusiasm, rushed demeanor, or should I say miserable demeanor, totally put a dampener on our evening. It was like \"what do you want?\" You have it, now \"get out.\" M",

The location and ambiance is fantastic with there is a live band along that plays Rock music outside the patio and steps away from the Park MGM and the Cosmopolitan Hotels.",

Asparagus was delicious and a great compliment to all the heavy fried stuff!  Mac and cheese was tasty but in all truth- could have used more cheese! Let's highlight the star of the dish people!  I'm definitely coming back!",

I ordered the fried pickles and the 14oz bone-in New York steak with a side of mashed potatoes and it was delicious. We didn't realize it at first (because we were tucked away in a little corner) but there was live music downstairs so we asked to be seated closer to the banister overlooking the downstairs.

The cheese dip was awesome and the flat bread which is made in house like almost everything else was the best bread in the batch.( the other breads not in house). How selection on tap is very solid, not the best beers ever but better than most places. But maybe I just have a weakness for smithwicks. The music was entertaining as well.

    "text": "\"Seachas cothuna gael do faic\"  (Resist everything but moderation)  -- Oscar Wilde  To savor the True experience of the Emerald Isles, who would think the path would lead to Las Vegas? At the doorstep of the New York New York Hotel?  It's a rubbish thought of course. Yet, there was a certain whimsy in the double-faux authenticity of Nine Fine Irishmen. And, by the DIsneyland-like ersatz takes of Vegas, NFI is a winner.  Compelled by a tempting menu, and reasonable fix prix for Vegas' Restaurant Week, my buddies and I were seated by thick-brogue staff to our table. RIGHT in front of the stage. I said, \"do you think we want a quieter spot?\" \"No this is fine\" they said. My friends -- either geniuses or precognitive.  Right after ordering our drinks (whiskey for me -- not usually a fan but \"when in Dublin...\") and meals, the band proceeded. Loud, traditional Irish folk songs done in a contemporary slant. The crowd that gathered was alive and into them. It was kick-ass (literally kick-ass, as the occasional song brought a riverdancing maiden to a platform. Watch your dental work if you stray too close). Yes, so over the top Irish, missing only a pot of gold and leprechauns (well one glitter-faced older lady dressed like Queen Elizabeth, reputedly there every evening, seemed to be channeling a leprechaun in her gleeful dancing).  Lest we forget the food ...  The first course, Colcannon Soup -- hands-down the BEST thing I ate over my five days at Vegas. So wonderful and so simple -- a thick soup of potatoes, butter, leeks, cream, cabbage and a dollop of bacon pieces crowning the velvety richness. Cholesterol be damned, each spoonful was worthy of a love sonnet. My main course of Shepherd's Pie, with port wine-infused beef tips and cutely served in a mini-kettle, was generous and oh-so comforting. Dessert, the bread & butter pudding of baked brioche, with golden raisins, topped with whiskey cream and caramel sauces, was almost flan-like in texture and a knockout. And big. I couldn't eat more than half.  Dinner was a huge carb-load, which I usually refrain from -- it hit my system like a pint of whiskey (just ask the persons I tried to text post-dinner). Between the glorious food, ribald entertainment and carbs I was in a cloud of euphoria. So if you're in Vegas and want to have a glamour of your Irish heritage, put your hands and stomach (and ears) in the hands of these nine fine men.",

We had just arrived from California and we hadn't had anything to eat since morning.  It was now dinner time and we were hungry.    We were seated outside.  The weather was nice, though warm, of course.  Someone was singing somewhere on the street so that added a nice little entertainment while waiting for our waiter.  He soon arrived and we ordered our drinks.  When our drinks arrived, our waiter said that they were having a problem with their \"stove\" -- that they might not be able to serve dinner.   A few minutes later, the waiter confirmed that the kitchen wasn't taking anymore orders because the stove wasn't working (or something like that).  Well, we were disappointed.  All we knew that we weren't going to eat, so we made a decision to just get up and leave.  We left our full drinks behind including that nice full glass of Guinness.  Oh well.  It is what it is.    We walked over to the Paris Hotel and found a place to eat there instead.",

    "text": "The \"New York, New York\" hotel and casino in Vegas is very much a microcosm of Las Vegas itself.  You can find all kinds of examples of humanity within.  Bros, bro hoes, preppy types, hipsters, wanna be's, classy people...you name it - you can find it there.  Its a smaller version of the \"barely organized chaos\" that exists outside on Vegas' strip.  Because of the way its laid out with the casinos, the shops, all the eateries and that various \"neighborhoods\", Ny Ny can best be described as cacophonous.  But nestled within this little den of chaos is a relative haven of tranquility and mellowness known as Nine Fine Irishmen.  For those of you who don't know (and really... what are there.. like 4 of you out there still left?), it models itself as an Irish Pub right out of Dublin.  The wife and I have been here twice in our wanderings; most recently for lunch and a pint of ale.    Without a doubt, this is a great place to rest, relax and recharge yourself with a pint of ale or perhaps a shot of whiskey and grab a bite to eat.  My fave drink here is a \"Black Velvet\", a lovely concoction of Stout and Cider that is the perfect parity tween sweet and strong.  The food is excellent too.  Highly recommended is the Fish n Chips.  The fish, never frozen, is delicious and served traditionally in a paper \"funnel\" along with the thick chips.  Also of note is their corn beef sandwich - which included generous portions of meat.  They also have traditional Anglo fare, like Shepherd's Pie and Bangers and Mash.  One of the nicest things about this place is when you walk in - all the sounds and chaos of the casino and goings on outside become dull and muted causing your cares to drift away.  Of course, having a pint or two doesn't hurt either!.  Its a very relaxing, mellow atmosphere.  Except after 10pm, that is.  Then it becomes a raucous and happening nightclub.  The place is a *tad* pricey - but only just a tad.  There are far more expensive places to eat and drink - but really, the quality of everything is worth it!  The employees..bartenders...waitresses...everyone, are very friendly and knowledgeable.  Our waitress, Tracy I think her name was, even knew what a \"Snug\" was in regards to pubs - and pointed out that they had three of them!  Woot!  Simply put, Nine Fine Irishmen is the perfect spot at the perfect place in Vegas.  An oasis of solemnity in the middle of a vast ocean of glorious chaos.  A must-visit kind of place when you want to settle down with a drink and recharge your inner-battery after strolling up and down the strip.",

And being I didn't feel like driving any more after having spent the day going in to Utah it seemed like a good opportunity.  I have seen the place quite often with a waiting line at dinner time but it was a slow night so I got right in.  Being it was only 90 and a light breeze blowing as sunset was approaching I asked if there was a spot on the patio.  Turned out the patio was almost vacant and the bonus was it was a smoking patio.  Normally I would face away from the sidewalk but I decided to spend the evening staring back at the folks checking out my dinner.  :-)  I was torn between the chicken pot pie ($19.00) and the shepherd's pie and after being informed by the waiter I would be a better man than he if I could finish the chicken pot pie if I could finish it that is what I ordered.  I finished it but desert was out of the question as I waddled away.  I chose a pint of Harps to wash it down with.  The pie was good but different as I am not used to a tomato based gravy with chicken.  The service was excellent and friendly.  I got a chance to chat a bit with the waiter as his section on the patio was almost empty that early in the evening.  Going through the restaurant it was more of a crowded noisy atmosphere and a live band was playing.  This is one of those occasions I would prefer to add a 1/2 star.",

My husband ordered the Shepard's pie and it was amazing too.   Also the servers are very friendly and knowledgeable. Our server recommended an amazing beer to go with each of our dishes. Also she was so enthusiastic. It was lovely to have a server that enjoyed her own restaurant so much.   Do stop in and have some pie and a beer if you visit Las Vegas.

The magners cider on draught had a very yeasty odor due to either poorly cleaned draught lines or glassware.  Tourist trap.   They have a modern POS system, but will not split bills for a 10 top. We pen and papered to figure out each couples total all while our server hung over the table. Just split the bill for people and they will be happier, tip better, and turn the table faster.   We go to Vegas with multiple couples every year for the past several years and this is the first time we have had this issue at any restaurant.  EDIT: 2 of my party that had the same meal are now feeling sick, so maybe not the best practices happening in the kitchen either.",

    "text": "TLDR: Worst service ever last night with a waitress that completely dismissed my concerns as though I were stupid.  Food was unremarkable. Atmosphere was your typical pub feel with a live band, and wasn't slammed (on the patio) for a Friday night.   The whole story: We sat on the patio for dinner at an Irish pub on the Strip. When we went to order, the waitress (Rosanna) asked if I wanted cheese on my entree, and I said sure, nonplussed. We ate the unremarkable and somewhat bland food, the bill came, our drinks were empty and we asked her to split the bill by seat. Not hard. 10 minutes go by and the waitress brought back our check, not split, and told us she couldn't split the appetizer. We sorted that out, and Rosanna took another 5 minutes to spilt our checks by seat. Drinks were still empty.   Once we got the split checks (which she had to auction off because she didn't remember who had what), I noticed there was a $1.50 upcharge for the cheese that the waitress didn't bother to tell me about, and tax and subtotal weren't on the split checks. Tax is different in Nevada than Texas (duh), so without tax listed on the bill, we didn't know how much it was. I had to do the math myself to figure it out. Thank Goodness I know how. I put my card in the check presenter intending to ask about the cheese but Rosanna whisked away all our payments before we could ask her anything.  She got back after another 10 minutes (still no refill or offer to refill drinks) and couldn't remember who had what again. My sister in law paid with two twenties, which should have covered her bill. It didn't,  come to find out there was also a 10% \"entertainment tax\" we didn't know about. We thought okay,  it's Vegas. It sucks but no big deal. My sister in law had to get change, which was brought back in bigger bills (no $1 bills to ensure the waitress got an appropriate tip).  I let the waitress know that I was unhappy with the cheese upcharge about which she didn't bother to tell me. I told her I used to wait tables and would never have just charged someone extra for something they didn't ask for without telling them, or offering something that was an upcharge without first divulging the cost. Rosanna said that she was sorry, but dismissed my concern because \"$1.50 isn't that much.\" I said that maybe it wasn't to her, but it might be to some people and it's the principle of the matter rather than the actual charge that irked me. She shrugged and walked off.   She ruined the vibe of the whole evening with her apathetic attitude. I still can't believe it.",

My hubby's a burger connoisseur & he swears it's top 5 he's had. The salmon, was cooked perfectly medium. It's been a while that I ordered a medium temp salmon & it came out just right. You would expect that in 5 star restaurants. The cheese in the salad, was a perfect addition. Our friend thought the Chopped salad was delicious too. The complimentary raisin bread, quite yummy. Ambiance: great rendition of an Irish pub. Looks like they had a large selection of beer, although we weren't drinking. Upstairs seating & outside available. Nice atmosphere music.  Service: she was good! Very attentive & fast service. Location: very easy access & walk to the new Park where the Arena is. Price: not bad at all! $59 for 3 incl non-alc Bev.

ABSOLUTELY NECESSARY.   The ambiance is 'pubbish' with stained wooden floors and walls, head stones, mirrors, marble pillars and dim chandeliers. Very subtle and nice. Being a quarter Irish, I'm always drawn to places like this. It gives me a False sense of feeling, that perhaps, this is what it might be like over yonder.   We were sat in a neat little sofa style seat adjacent to the restrooms. I don't mind this.. In fact, it was quite the scene. The entry / exit door for waiters / waitresses / bussers and so on is conveniently  placed side by side with the restrooms. I couldn't count how many men and women walked into the kitchen dazed and confused. Even the restroom entrances themselves were a little confusing, with dudes going in the women's and women going into the men's restrooms. Good times.  I was about to order a chicken pot pie and my sister the Shepherd's pie when a waitress walked by with an individual chicken pot pie. These things are ginormous! They're served in a tin pale that's stuffed to the top! The proverbial 'muffin top' so to speak. We ordered the chicken pot pie to share, drunken onion rings and each had a cup of Colcannon soup.   The appetizers were delightful. The drunken onions rings are marinated in a bloody Mary / beer batter mix, fried and served with spicy honey mustard. Scorching temperatures had us waiting on these bad boys, but I have to tell you, they were really good. I didn't catch the hints of bloody mary flavoring, however, the spicy mustard sauce made up for that.   The Colcannon was what the doctor ordered. The weather during the day had been in the mid-70's and evening hours around the low 40's, so the soup compensated for the cool weather and warmed me up instantly. Did somebody say bacon!? Resting inside this creamy soup delight, Irish bacon is topped on pureed potatoes, cabbage and leeks.   The chicken pot pie took the cake though. As mentioned the crust spews out of the top of the tin pale it's served in. Light, flaky and buttery.  The crust's solid defense was no match for my fork's offense.  The chicken was succulent, salty and tender. And wow.. The sauce / stock the vegetables are mixed in was probably one of the best tasting things I've ever had. Period. There was cheddar in this pie, which I've never had in a pot pie, and it (along with a few other ingredients) created an orange like cream that was too tasty! I was full, but kept eating.  Flavor in every bite and never EVER lacked it.   Great service and GREAT food!",

We didn't get to see the band play, or try any of the food on the menu, since we came pretty early and didn't stay for too long. But having browsed over it a lot of things sounded delicious, I'll have to come back for another visit to try some of their items on the menu.  The bartenders were all very nice and checked up on us often, they also had no trouble giving good descriptions of the beers they offered. I've never been to Ireland so I have no idea what a \"real\" Irish pub would be like, but our experience in here was so good, I don't really care. Definitely will be back.",

Had a cup of the soup that starts with a C, with cabbage, leak, and potato - scrumptious, but I don't think it needed the drizzle of olive oil on top, so you might want to ask them to hold that. Kids enjoyed the Irish nachos with corned beef - mildly creative and simple take on comfort food that scored four thumbs up. Nice patio seating looking at the gaudy lights of the M&M shop and whatnot across the street, with heaters for those chilly days. It's a good reliable stop for an afternoon brew break when you've been walking all day and want to rest your feet.",

    "text": "This is, I'd say, the third-best Irish pub in Vegas, not to say that it's not at all a great place to dine, drink, and have a bit of craic (which, incidentally, is the Irish word for fun, enjoyment, and fellowship). The only places I found that beat it out are Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay and McMullan's, a free-standing joint near the Orleans Hotel & Casino a bit west of the strip on Tropicana. The interior of the place is capacious but doesn't feel cavernous, as there's an upper level and a lower level to keep things cozy. The decor is Irish, a bit on the fancier side, with bars upstairs and downstairs full of knick-knacks just like you'd find in pubs on the other side of the Pond. The tables feature benches, different kinds of chairs, and several of the ones upstairs are in little nooks so you can have a bit of privacy if you desire. All of this is quite authentic; pubs in Ireland feel quite a bit like this (although most of them are smaller). The food is superb. My favorite is the Shepherd's Pie, which is a mixture of ground beef, onions, and culinary magic topped with mashed potatoes, baked in a steel lunch pail like a shepherd would actually use. The beef is perfectly cooked, the potatoes are perfectly browned on top, and digging into the hearty portion makes you wish you could chase woolly animals around a field to burn some of the calories off once again. The desserts are great; I'm always a fan of bread pudding, and this place delivers. They probably have cheesecake, too, being that they're in the New York New York and somehow, cheesecake is a staple of any restaurant professing any sort of connection with the Empire State, but since you're looking to dine in an Irish restaurant, I recommend that you forego it for the bread pudding. You can have a more authentic experience with your Irish pub atmosphere and you can thank me later. The service is great; usually it was just my fiance and I eating together, so we'd sit at the bar and revel in the friendly face-to-face interactions with the bartender, but the table service is also nice and friendly so you can't go wrong there. Ask your server for what their favorite dish is, as well; you really can't go wrong with anything they serve, and you should definitely find out what other options are instead of just going with my recommendation of the Shepherd's Pie. The sandwiches, for example, are also fantastic. Finally, the beer! They've good beer, including Guinness and Harp and Smithwick's (pronounced Smithicks for the uninitiated; just drop the W), and they're poured in good portions for good prices. So sit back, relax, have a pint of the dark (or light) stuff with your meal. And enjoy the craic!",

    "text": "I ate here this past Sunday evening for a late dinner with my girlfriend.  Whenever we walked by the place was packed but we were told that it would only be a 10 minute wait.  Less than 5 minutes later we were in and seated.  The inside of the place was cool, done mostly in wood and there was an Irish band playing like there is every night after 9.  For dinner my girlfriend and I decided to start off by splitting the goat cheese salad and beer cheese dip.  The salad was pretty refreshing as it had a vinaigrette dressing with a nice big hunk of goat cheese on top of it.  However it paled in comparison to the beer cheese dip which came served with some crackers and bread.  Man was that stuff good and very cheesy!  You could even taste the hint of Smithwick's that went into it. For my entree I decided on the bangers and mash since we were at an Irish place.  It came with two links of sausage covered in a mushroom sauce covering the mashed potatoes which in turn were covered with cabbage.  My favorite part of my entree was the mashed potatoes which had some mustard seed in it which gave it a nice taste.  Other than that the rest of my entree was also good.  The bottom line for me is that I would head back here in the future but before the live band starts at 9 PM.  You see the state of NV has an 18%+ sales tax on all food and drinks when there is live entertainment or so our waiter explained to me.  So while I enjoyed the food and atmosphere that definitely left a sour taste in my mouth.",

There is nothing better than dancing with Michi, (the little Japanese Lady) with a nice beer in hand, shouting out 'Who the F*ck is Alice!' on a Friday night. This place was my Cheers, I knew everyone, and everyone knew me. If you want the club vibe, please go to Hakkassan, and leave the real fun to those who appreciate it.

All of the entrees were perfectly prepared. Even though the meat cuts were not of the same caliber of some local steak houses, I think they were actually better prepared than many others. The sides are simple and True to tradition. Buttered peas (peas with butter), creamed corn (corn with cream, simple and not overdone), the mashed potatoes were smooth with shallots and garlic mixed in. The quality seems consistent across the menu.   My only complaints are that the music is too loud for conversation (most people seemed happy though) and the wait staff were more South American than Irish (though friendly and attentive).    Nine Fine Gentlemen is like an oasis in a desert of invented chef restaurants. Yes, this was invented too, but they got this one right.",

First of all, there are a ton of different bars in Vegas, as well as a myriad of nightlife experiences to be had, but there is nothing quite like \"Ninefine,\" as my girls and I like to call it.  The bar itself gets full pretty fast, so show up early (think 8pm).  Also, there is a thing called the \"tap table\" that can be reserved for up to a few hours.  Ours was equipped with Harp and Guiness, but wasn't exactly ready for pouring when we arrived at 8pm for our reservation.  After a quick fix, and a replaced keg, we were ready to rock and roll.  To start off we had a shot of Jameson, with a pickle back (or side shot).  This is a MUST to try.  The pickle juice is cold, yummy, and takes away the bite of the the Scotch whiskey.  After a shot and a beer, we settled in to order food.  Shepherd's pie?  OF COURSE!  There is also a chicken pot pie that almost looks like it deserves to be in an art museum, rather than eaten.  All the food fare at Ninefine is delish!  I don't recommend the sausage appetizers, or the fried pickles, simply because they seem to have a chef who is tempura crazy and all that grease does not go well with heavy drinking.  Finally, there is the entertainment.  The traditional Irish band, and dancers are spot on for this spot!  You will be lifting pints, most likely, with other Irishmen who deem this venue worthy of home and often frequent it on their trips to Vegas.  Why?  I'm not sure...I certainly don't plan on finding a Tejano bar in Dublin when I visit.  The nine fine Irishmen can be found high above the bar, and the ambiance certainly feels Irish and authentic.  This, again, is a definite must when you plan your next Sin City excursion!  TIP:  Ninefine is located in New York, New York and is easily accessible from south strip - or a short cab ride from mid strip.",

Honestly, we wanted to try more from their menu (I did a long list of dishes \" must try\")  but we were run out of  free space in our stomachs. :)  Everything was good but especially a want to mention is a Colcannon soup.  It was something unbelievable! So tasty and tender!  Every spoon every sip of this soup made me  uncontrollably  produce slight groan  \"m-m-m\"!  in pleasure.   Folks. This soup is \"a must\"!  Really recommend to try it in the first place.",

We decided upon Nine Fine Irishmen for location more than cuisine selection but were pleasantly surprised. The atmosphere is standard \"Irish Pub\" (with live music while we there, though they played a minimal choice of Irish/Celtic music) but the food takes a step beyond. True to an olde Anglo UK menu, the dishes are well prepared and more hearty than the plain 'ole fish n' chips (which they do serve and rather well). They won't seat partial parties so it's tougher when your in-laws are habitually late but once you get in, it's enjoyable. We were seated upstairs in our own private \"rooms though the waitress still had to scream for our orders over the music downstairs.  For the price, the appetizers are fairly moderate and the entrees worthy. You'll dent your credit card but you won't regret it.",

Rira plays classic Irish music and they take requests (so long as they are familiar with the music, which is mainly Irish music). They play from 9PM-2:30AM, every night except on Tuesdays. The ambiance is lively and everyone there appears to just want to have a good time. Nine Fine Irishmen is a small pub so one has to get there early to snag a seat. Customers there are mostly Irish or from UK; it is a tourist-friendly place! Customers are friendly, so be prepared to have a random stranger strike up a conversation with you.   I would give this place a 5-star rating if it weren't for the poor service from the bartenders. Whenever I have tried to order drinks, I either get ignored and have to wait a while or get rudely told to wait, while bartenders proceed to wipe the counter instead of taking my order. They don't smile, take long to bring your drink, and have an off-standish attitude the entire time they are providing service. As I mentioned above, I come here for the band.",

Quite honestly, we really like it, have tried multiple items on the menu (all yummy), and will mostly likely return again.  The only reason that I took 1 star off is because of the incredibly slow service.  We have dined at several different times in the past, but last night our reservation was at 5:45 since we were headed to the Def Leppard concert at MGM.  The restaurant wasn't too busy, but still super slow service.  This is an ongoing thing at this place.  The food gets 5 stars for sure, but the service leaves something to be desired.",

There's a decent selection of whiskeys and some fun cocktails with every combo of stereotypical Irish beer and liquor you could think of. And the food does not disappoint! We ordered the onion rings with mustard (it's a huge greasy order and my husband and I really should not have finished it but it was so good) and the bangers & mash (truly excellent, highly recommended). The chicken pot pie was popular among the patrons beside us and will definitely be something we try next time we visit. I also have my eye on the lamb dishes too...  The other highlight for me besides the food was Sin E Ri Ra (the band) and Tara Reid (the dancer). If they're on stage I guarantee you'll have a good time. They fulfill requests with your tips and do a great mix of folk, traditional Irish song, and classic singalongs. They do the best rendition of \"Country Roads\" I've ever heard! And Tara is simply mesmerizing to watch. There's also a dance floor right in front of the stage if you want to boogie.  Slainte! Croi follain agus gob fliuch!",

He had some excellent suggestions for lunch and also provided some insider tips. We had in terms of good the buffalo wings (very good) but what was outstanding was the melted cheese drip with various crackers, roasted cheese crisps and breads etc. These were very good and not your usual fare. We were there at the beginning of happy hour and we found the well drinks were not your usual rot-gut, but for example gin they served Bombay etc. Cory chatted with the couple next to us and joked with both of us and we had a very enjoyable experience. The couple we had just met said they always stopped here when they were in town, and I can see why. Excellent watering stop!",

The baked Brie is the best appetizer specially if u r Brie lover as we r.  My husband loves to try different dishes every time and he was never disappointed. As for me I'm kind of stuck with my Sheppard pie from that first time. I always have a bite from my husband dish, don't get me wrong I like them , but I really LOVE my Shepherd pie.  This time we also got a dessert, OMG it was so good.",

We arrive 15 minutes prior to our reservation and then the person told us they were going to sit us outside and rearrange tables. If you have ever been there the outside is more of a lounge and like couples we were a large party. Their reason they gave us is they took walk ups and that's why they didn't have a table. I asked how long would the wait be and they said they didn't know because they had so many people. The people even called to verify that we were coming and how many people. So we made a reservation, received horrible customer service. So think twice before you think about going here. They don't care about basic customer service!",

So I checked Yelp and saw that Nine Fine Irishmen was highly rated and close by. We were seated outside and each ordered the mashed potato side dish. Since we have also heard pickles can be good for runners we decided to split the fried pickles appetizer too. (In hindsight fried pickles were not the best choice pre-running.)  The mashed potatoes really were amazing. They were smashed potato style with the skins mixed in and were just the right texture. Yum! And the fried pickles... Oh wow. They breading was thick but still fluffy. They were lovely.  Wonderful place for a pre-race meal. I hope I can go back for a full meal sometime.",

    "text": "Given our restaurant experience in Vegas is fairly limited compared to the opportunities available, this is our favorite restaurant and we always make a point to visit when we're in town.   Our first trip was phenomenal: We sat in a secluded section of the restaurant that houses a couple booths and were lucky to have the area to ourselves for most of our meal. The beer cheese appetizer was delicious, ESPECIALLY the pretzel bread. Sadly, they've since discontinued offering the pretzel bread in the basket. In fact, we always have dip left over, never enough bread to finish it.   I've stuck with the salmon (topped with smoked salmon) entree every time. I love it THAT much! Much of the food is pretty heavy, but the salmon is yummy and never fails to satisfy. My husband and friends have sampled various menu items and we've never been disappointed with a meal.   The last three times we visited we were sat downstairs by the stage (and, unfortunately, the bathrooms.) Love when the live band and dancers are performing, although be prepared to experience some noise in that area of the bar. I think that next month we'll request a seat upstairs, as I get kind of tired of sitting by the bathrooms.   Still, we will return again and again!!",

Both were very rich and filling.  The meat and mushroom pies were like little empanadas.  Not what I was expecting from an Irish pub, but passable.

Crab cakes were moist and delicious and flavorful, sheppard's pie was delicious and a hearty portion. Ambiance was fabulous. We chose to sit outside in the balcony overlooking the strip.

I did enjoy the overly drunk very Irish bar patron that was offering me $20 per beer because the bartenders had cut him off. When the band didn't seem Irish enough for him he would scream obscenities until a more authentic song started playing.  The crowd varied and everyone was friendly. The bartenders were friendly and maintained eye contact with me to get me another $10 Guinness as soon as I started running low.

I am not one of those girls that gets all dolled up to go out to the clubs kinda things, but I do like to drink and mingle and enjoy some good music and NINE FINE IRISHMEN is the place to do that.   I went here on a Monday night when they had an Irish band playing who was really good. The took request and played the ones that they knew, which was a lot I was pleasantly surprised. We drank a many Guinness and danced to the Irish music. The entire group I was with had a good time. Now I did not eat any food here, as I was on a liquid diet here so I can not review on that. I was here for the drinking and the music which both were beyond awesome.   Other great things about this place is that there were plenty of table to sit down at and talk while the band played. Also while the music is playing there is a girl who comes up and does some professional Irish dancing on a stage which was impressive. Made me wish I could Irish jig just like her.   So if you like music and livations but don't want to get all super dressed up and go out to the meat markets then definitely try this place. I will be when I go back.",

Although there are not a ton of real \"authentic\" places in Las Vegas, this place actually does a pretty good job of giving you the Irish Pub experience.  Dark wood finishes, high-top tables, and live Irish music definitely all contribute to a pretty good ambiance and a great place to get a beer.  On my brother's bachelor party weekend, we started the festivities off here with a low key bucket of Buds (I know, not very Irish, but you gotta start somewhere).  $25 for 5 beers wasn't too over-priced, plus they had a menu of bar food available.  We tried one of the sampler plates, which was delicious but was disappointingly served to us in a plastic take-out container with no plates and limited silverware.  I don't know if we were closing the kitchen out or something, but I figured they could have done a little better than that.  At the end of the day, we were neither hungry nor thirsty when we left, so I think Nine Fine Irishmen was worth it.",

Prices were fair for the food but overpriced for the drinks and service was okay.  A little rushed but not rudely.

    "text": "Craftsteak Vs. Nine Fine Irishmen  Craftsteak at the MGM Grand is a wonderful restaurant. The service is impeccable, the decor nothing short of stunning, and you will, without a doubt have a fine meal here - so long as you are willing to pay the price, and a hefty price it is. The real question is if it's really worth it. Regretfully, my answer is - maybe not.   Craftsteak barely misses the mark in my book; expect to pay more than double what you would at other equally good venues. If we bring the total picture into play, not just food, then our measuring stick has to change and I would give the place 4 stars instead of three. For me, I prefer a beautiful, friendly atmosphere and great food over museum-quality surroundings and average to good food. This review is actually a comparison/contrast and hopefully will give you a good idea what to expect.   Our table of three at Craftsteak enjoyed a few drinks then started off with wagyu tartare. It was nothing short of outstanding  - and an extremely large portion! I was expecting 2-3 oz but received what appeared to be more than 1/2 a pound of pure delight. It was opulent. Had I known, I would have ordered it for dinner and called it a night. The three of us actually struggled to finish it - it is very heavy.   On to the steaks. We decided on a 32oz  rib for two and a 16 oz New York strip. As sides, we ordered the mushroom assortment which included somewhat rare hen of the woods which is a delight in an of itself, and sauteed Brussels sprouts.   Complaints... well, I must say the steaks lacked seasoning. Sorry, Chef/Owner Colicchio, it was close but no cigar.  A great steak should need little more than some fresh cracked pepper and salt, our two steaks felt devoid of either. To add insult to injury, the rib was excessively fatty with a rather large grain of connective tissue running through the dead center. This had to be a mistake. The knives provided were surprisingly dull (security issue?) and we had a hell of a time carving through this sucker.  If not for the great company, I was seriously considering sending it back.   We packed up some of the dinner rolls and the remaining steak to make late night sandwiches in our suite that evening- we were feeling like beached whales after the tartare. The check arrived and I handed over $375 to our waiter. Ouch. Double Ouch. I shudder to think what the bill would have been if we ordered deserts and coffee.  Lets move ahead 24 hours to a little Irish joint called the \"Nine Fine Irishmen\" at the New York, New York, right over the connecting bridge from the MGM Grand.  It's a bit loud, but bristling with a friendly, not raucous, energy and live music that was just loud enough that you could still very easily have a conversation. This time it was just myself and my wife. We sat at the deep marble bar (we didn't feel like waiting an hour for a table) and ordered two of the Guinness 250 limited edition stouts. Really yummy (if you like stout).   We shared a bowl of their colcannon soup which is a hearty blend of leeks, potato and irish bacon. They offered it to us with fresh soda bread and European butter with a herbs. I was simply in heaven. I considered licking the bowl, but there were too many people, including my wife, watching.  It was at this point that I started feeling bitter about Craftsteak. My 16 oz NY strip arrived (round two) and horseradish crusted halibut. Perfection! I was enjoying a great beer with a simply phenomenal steak that was cooked to perfection. The halibut was flaky and succulent in every way. Here's the best part - our bill was $64.. Sixty Four dollars compared to what we spent at Craftsteak! ($375). There simply was no comparison. As much as I think Gordon Ramsay is a pompous ass, (and I have eaten at  his restaurant London), there is something to be said for his philosophy of great, simple food. Craftsteak is good, but with the exception of the tartare, does not blow-me-away. They are missing the mark just a bit by trying to be an over the top. You are paying mostly for a name and a very posh atmosphere.   Considering the price and the quality of food, Nine Fine Irishmen was the winner for me. Granted, it's not a somber, fine dining experience, but I enjoy eating out to have a good time and a good meal, not just gawk at the decor and whisper in the amber glow of a restaurant that is bucking for a michelin star.",

Stopped in here for an afternoon snack and ordered Rustic Potatoes with Red and Yellow Curry Dips, Braised Beef and Mushroom Pies, and Ale Battered and Spicy Sausages with Guinness and Honey Mustard Dips. The Potatoes were good, but I found the curry dips to be on the bland side. I instead dipped them in the Guinness and Honey Mustard Dips that came with the Sausages. The best out of the three was the Braised Beef and Mushroom Pies. It was served with what I thought was salsa, but it was a tomato and chive dressing. This was a lot of food for three appy's and they were only $6 each! I can't wait to try some entrees next time around!",

    "text": "My three friends and I stopped in to grab an early dinner at 4:00pm before a Cirque show at 7:30pm. We were here for two hours.  The hostess showed us to the table and said if we wanted to eat outside instead of inside we could choose a table. When we went outside we were ambushed by three waiters who were very pissed that we took it upon ourselves to change tables. Another waiter came up and thankfully diffused the situation. I wish he would have been our waiter as it was apparently it was our waiter's first day. He forgot to put our appetizer orders in and we ended up getting our entrees after 45 minutes. The food was lackluster. I've had better Shepherd's Pie at The Cheesecake Factory.  Our waiter tried to make it up to us by saying dessert would be complimentary since he messed up with the appetizers. Well, he redeemed himself we all thought. We each were going to order a dessert since we each ordered an appetizer. When he came back to take our order he THEN clarified that ONE dessert would be comp'd. We only ended up ordering two to share between the four of us. When he brought the desserts out he explained that he still felt badly about the appetizer debacle and was going to comp both desserts. Well fine then. Whatever. He tried.  Our dinner was over just after 6:00pm and we did not have a car and our hotel was at the other end of the strip. We hurried back to our hotel to change and then hurried (practically ran) back to NY NY to see the Cirque show. Somewhere in MGM the pads of my feet gave out and turned into two HUGE blisters. I was miserable the remainder of the weekend. (They still hurt mind you.)  The next day I checked my bank account and realized I was charged twice. I called and spoke with the manager/chef who was SO nice and friendly. It was straightened out very quickly however I was out $120 while it was pending in my account the entire weekend.  I don't think I would eat here again after the long dinner that literally ruined my vacation. I am very thankful that the manager/chef was able to straighten everything out.",

So, yes, it's not an ultra-authentic Irish Pub, BUT it is a place in Vegas where you can get some some good Irish grub and live entertainment that doesn't involve bottles service a $500+ booth and waiting in line for an hour.  8 girls and I went for dinner and had a cute waiter (wish I could remember his name now) who was super attentive and helpful. We ate, drank, chatted, drank, ate, drank, etc... They had cider and guiness straight from Ireland and it was perfect.   We then found out they were having a live band - a live IRISH band. So, we nixed our previous plans, did a quick wardrobe change and headed back to the NFI for the music. The first 1/2 of the set was full of upbeat irish classics. The second 1/2  - good old American favorites (think Bon Jovi, Journey, CCR, etc).  They even had an Irish dancer.   The place was awesome and a real change of pace for Vegas. No posers allowed.",

    "text": "The bar scene on the Vegas Strip makes me feel old and fat and poor.   Every bar we went into in every casino had muted pastel lights and space age decor, and was filled with young, blonde, huge-racked girls in tiny clothes, and the men who love them.  The bar tab was inevitably a month's rent, and the drinks were watery.   This is why Nine Fine Irishmen is different.  Don't get me wrong; there are a large number of the young, blonde, huge-racked girls in tiny clothes and the young men who pine for them here, but there's also a nice mix of people closer to my age.  It really invoked the pub atmosphere I know from the U.K.  The decor is all dark wood, and I think is the actual interior of a pub shipped over from Ireland.  If it's not authentic, it's an excellent replication.   The house band, Ri Ra, was great!!!  They mixed old pub drinking songs with Pogues covers and other Celtic rock songs.   The beer and whiskey selection was excellent as well.   We were kind of hungry, but none of the appetizers appealed to us.   Still, it was a good time. They lose a star for the price of the drinks ($24 for two pints and a whiskey) and the slight lack of seating space, since as I mentioned before, me=old, fat, poor.  But if I'm ever keen to drink on the Strip again, I'll make an effort to come here.",

    "text": "This place is run by cheap bastards.   I have eaten here before. Nice atmosphere, but overpriced food. The fish and chips are okay, but nothing to write home about (we have better in SF).   The reason why I am giving this restaurant 1 star and a bad review is because I booked a night at the NYNY casino-resort where the restaurant is located. Part of my package included several two for one coupons. I was on that leg of my trip by myself and assumed I could use the coupon for NFI as 50% off a single item. The restaurant refused to honor the coupon (from their own property) and treated me very rudely (and this was within minutes of checking in). I can't believe they would be so cheap that they wouldn't honor a coupon in this way (for $14 fish and chips) and acted like it was the weirdest or most awful thing in the world that I would request to use it as a single diner. She told me I would have to order one fish and chips and get a second order in order to use the coupon (thus wasting the food). Not only that, but the host and bartenders didn't seem to know what was going on and were rude. I will never set foot inside this place again or NYNY. These people are cheap and it shows bad judgment and management when people book a vacation at your establishment, are looking forward to going to this restaurant, and then treat their own patrons so badly. Jerks. I am not sure what their management is thinking, but I won't ever give them my business again.",

And you have to try the beer cheese dip as an appetizer.  The live band, Sin E Ri-Ra, just gets the place jumpin. They make you wish you knew all the words to the irish songs so you could swing your beer and sing along with the tune. Its a small intimate atmosphere, with the band right in front of you. They even bring out an irish dance for some of the songs and she dances on a table. I've been here three years in a row and its never disappointed!  If the noise gets too much for you they have an outdoor patio (and balcony) right on the strip where you can relax for a few minutes before jumping back into the party.",

Kinda sad that one of the more \"authentic\" Irish bars in Vegas is on The Strip, but they do a damn respectable job. Well portioned car bombs, amazing bloody marys, and, oooh, the sausages. Good music, good colcannon, and genuinely Irish and Scottish guys working the bar. Prices are what you'd expect on The Strip, but you get quite a bit of personality and good stuff for that price.  One of our favorite things to do here was to just order a couple of drinks and maybe an appetizer, and go hang out on the 2nd floor outside balcony overlooking the Strip.  Never very crowded out there (because there isn't any service), and the people- and light-watching is great.  If you're coming to listen to music, and you want to sit, be sure to get there early.  It's packed every night around the stage.",

We had to wait even longer for food to come out again, but our waitress did give us a free dessert for the problems. The food tasted really good, I had the pot pie and my boyfriend had the shepards pie.   Why did i give this place such a low score? Two words: Food Poisoning.   A while later that day my stomach started turning and so did my boyfriends. We shared both dishes, so I can't say if it was one or the other or both dishes.

    "text": "The band was amazing and the atmosphere was lively. But, seating is limited if you want to see the band. It was standing room only and the only place to stand aside from the bar was right in the middle of the foot traffic from the servers going back and forth to all of their tables from the bar. The food was average for an Irish pub and a little over priced. They did have a wide selection of Irish beer and cider on tap though, so that was nice. Overall I would say that the place is pretty run-of-the-mill; the reason for the four stars as opposed to three is that the live band was very, very good and they make a trip to the pub absolutely worth it.",

Steamers: winner of the night!! little clams in a white garlic, wine, and tomato broth. the broth was sooo good i kept eating it with my bread and then finally just with my spoon.   the lady raved about the shepard pies, which id definitely want to try next time. and they had a small stage with a set up for live music, altho they werent playing when i was there.   all in all, a fun nice vibe and yummy food!",

    "text": "When you picture a stereotypical version of the Irish, what do you see?  Men of every size and shape standing around, holding a pint of Guinness (or Smithwick's or Boddingtons) in one hand, the other draped around some other bloke's neck, singing--nay, YELL-singing at the top of their lungs to \"Danny Boy.\" Beer is sloshed about, there's laughing, kissing, the works--while it's balls-cold outside.  Right? Am I right? You know I'm right.  This is almost identical to what happens at Nine Fine Irishmen (except outside, you have the desert). There's someone on the piano, singing on the mike, while the drunkards try to one-up the poor sod with their drunken renditions of Irish-y versions of American pop songs.  And as much as I detest karaoke and annoying drunkards, sometimes it's fun to partake in both ventures. Nine Fine Irishmen offers this opportunity, in addition to their excellent whisky selection and standard pub fare.  I dedicate my 400th Yelp review to you, Nine Fine Irishmen. And here's to hoping that next time I visit, I don't call you \"Three Drunk Irishmen, or whatever that bar's called.\"",

The bread and cheese appetizer was outstanding. It came with a nice sample of various breads and the cheese was quite tasty.   I also ordered the shepherd's pie. For an $18 entree, I would have expected a larger quantity of food and for it to be more flavorful. It wasn't terrible by any stretch, but it just was surprisingly bland.   The ambience was really cool to me. We sat in the upstairs portion in a booth that felt secluded from the rest of the guests -- like we had our own private dining space.   The server was very friendly and accommodating but the service itself seemed a little bit slow-paced for my liking.   All-in-all, I thought this was an ok dining experience, but wouldn't go out of my way to be a repeat customer.",

Since it does get quite packed in here while the bands are playing, expect to be on your own as far as the service goes. We fared much better upstairs, watching the band from the balcony, and had better luck with our drink orders at the bar. Downstairs, I had absolutely no luck ordering a drink. I was fighting tooth and nail to get to the bar, and since I'm quite small, it was impossible to be seen by the bartender who continued to ignore me even though I was waving my cash around like a mad woman.",

We had a party of 6 people.  I am wondering why the tip was automatically included for a party of six especially when it says it wasn't.  I am also wondering how many people leave another tip because it says the tip is not included!  Seems unprofessional and maybe unethical.  Prices were high for portions and quality.  Mediocre fish and chips (two pieces of fish) for $24.  Too early for music so can't comment on that.  I will probably not go back especially with so many other choices.",

    "text": "By far, the worst experience I've ever had. If you reserve months in advance for a party, be sure to confirm with them closer to your event at this place because there is a high chance they will call you (if you're lucky) within an 1 1/2 hours to tell you they don't have room for your party. Because this is exactly what happened to us. We had to take the patio area (not our choice) since we were told that was the only thing they that night because a wedding party had reserved our area a week and a half ago. I really think they were offered more money and we got bumped from our spot. Apparently, the little guy doesn't count in this town no matter how far in advance you reserve. Where are you going to find another venue on a Saturday night in Las Vegas for 20 people for a visiting author at the last minute nearing Christmas? NOWHERE!!  The hostess was also rude enough to ask why the planner she was there so early before the event (15 minutes). What does that matter? When the hosted noted there was a cake involved, the party planner was told no outside food was allowed and there would be a $30.00 charge for outside food. Really??!! For a cake???!! I've never known a restaurant to make objections to a cake being brought in for a special event before in my life. Alcohol brought in is understandable. By the this time, the manager had come over because the party planner was upset and getting loud. The cake fee was waived and apologized for the mix up when explained what had happened. The party did go on as planned, however, the hostess did want to know if she could close out the check midway through our event and wanted to know when we would be leaving. When informed that we weren't leaving yet, the hostess she stated, \" Well, as long as you're ordering drinks.\" The icing on the red hot cake for us, was when the customized cake taken into the back for safe keeping. Every restaurant that I've ever been into knows that when a cake is specially decorated in such a manner, you bring it out to the party first to see it, maybe take pictures with it BEFORE you cut it up to be eaten. THIS PLACE DID NOT DO THAT!!! No one saw the cake, no one was able to see the care taken in decorating this cake!! They cut it all up before anyone saw it!!   I don't know who runs this place, but save yourself the trouble and don't come here. Look elsewhere because this could happen to you and all your careful planning can be undone all because of mistakenly renting out the wrong place. Waiving the cake fee, removing a couple of items from the bill does not make up for a ruined experience with the managerial staff for a special event months in planning. I will never come back to this place again. If I could, I would give this place no stars.",

God help you if you wander in and just sit down.. They'll be all over you and ejecting you before you can warm the seat.  Only thing missing therefore is the Irish hospitality, but sure what the hell, I'll go home to Dublin for that :)",

The atmosphere closely resembles a traditional Irish pub with dark wood paneling, dim lighting and wood tables.  We started our meal with the beer and cheese dip, which was outstanding.  I actually hate beer, so I wasn't expecting to enjoy this appetizer, but it was incredible.  We also ordered the drunken onion rings, which were quickly consumed by our group.  I ordered the horseradish crusted sea bass for my entree and loved every bite.  My friend who ordered the New York steak encrusted with blue cheese said that it was the best steak he had ever eaten.  Our server was right there when we needed her and answered all of our questions about the menu.  Typically one does not think of fine dining when one thinks of Irish cuisine, but I can't say enough good things about the food and atmosphere at Nine Fine Irishmen.  We spent about $40 per person including beer and cocktails, which I felt was an excellent value.  Highly recommended!",

I had a burger with Irish cheddar and bacon.... does anything beat a well executed burger?  It was great.... especially with a good Guinness.    The second meal was dinner.... which was a bit hazy.  It was kind of like a roast in a guinness sauce over mashed potatoes.  The important thing is to remember that it was great.  For dessert, I had the Bushmill's bread pudding.... which I have learned is the favorite on this forum!  It was awesome.... especially with another Guinness!  This place will be at the top of my list if I ever get back to Vegas.  Highly recommend!!",

The best things we ordered were the Rib Eye, the Horseradish Crusted Mahi Mahi, the soup that .. um, starts with a C ... and has leeks and stuff in it, and the beer cheese dip appetizer.  Neutral opinion on the garlic mashed potatoes and asparagus, but they were less than half eaten between the three of us.  We did not at all like the chicken pot pie ... the crust was awesome and pretty, but the pot pie part ... erm .. maybe it was just an off day, but the potatoes and carrots were well undercooked for a pot pie and I couldn't eat them (and I'm not picky).  The sauce in it was OK and the chicken and peas were ok, but other than that I sent a lot of it back when I would have still liked to eat.  With one drink apiece and three people, the bill was over $150  .. a little steep considering Outback would have been better.",

    "text": "If an Irish pub making a strong attempt at being \"authentic\" seems like an odd choice for a Las Vegas hotel/casino, it's because it is.  Nine Fine Irishmen is sprawling, dark, and comfy; like a Bennigan's on crack.  It's precisely that cracked-out quality that reminds you you're in Vegas and not in a Dublin pub.    The restaurant is huge and furnished warmly, and your fellow diners are likely to be in various states of intoxication--from stone cold sober to the mother next to us in our snug (and I do mean snug; our tables were a foot away from each other, tops) whose tipsy husband kept encouraging her to use her \"library voice\" while their tween son looked like he wanted to gouge out his ear drums with a salad fork.  The menu boasts a lot of traditional Irish favorites, which is great and all, but not exactly the sort of fare you want to chow down on before a night of drinking, gambling, and moving up and down the strip.  On the whole, it's heavy.  I tried the Shepherd's Pie, for example, which is basically under-seasoned ground beef and mashed potatoes served in a metal pail.  My bad.  The portions are really generous, though.  I had enough meat and potatoes left in my bucket that I could've carried it around with me all night, handing out \"pie\" by the handful to delighted passersby.   All in all, Nine Fine Irishmen isn't a bad restaurant.  In fact, the Drunken Onion Rings were pretty alright.  It's just that, given its location and clientele, it's a dumb restaurant.",

    "text": "First night in Vegas:  After a very long flight, not really the flight but the delays in San Jose. I arrived in Las Vegas... about 90 minutes later than I had expected... I had already made reservations at Nine Fine Irishmen but I had to constantly push it back due to the delays... Finally got to the hotel and just threw my bags on the floor, didn't even change or wash up or anything, because I was absolutely famished!  My girlfriend and I walked over to NY NY and were greeted by one of the hosts there and asked us if we wanted to sit downstairs or upstairs. I asked which is louder and he offered to take us in and we could have our pick which was great. We decided to sit up stairs overlooking the stage where a band was playing a lot of Irish fare.  The decor and the audacity of the place is awesome. It's like Ireland threw up from across the pond and it all landed in this restaurant. I loved it from the minute we walked in.  Now on to dinner...  We started dinner off with the Drunken Onion Rings. Now I've had my fair share of onion rings in the past and I would have to say that these fat behemoths take the cake hands down. They were huge but they were cooked to perfection. The batter was amazing and the onions on the inside were cooked perfectly.  Now onto the entrees for the evening, my girlfriend decided on the Pan Roasted Red Snapper which looked out of sight and I'm sure was very tasty since there wasn't any left for me to even try. haha. And I had the Pork Porterhouse, which when it came out I was actually in shock. It was HUGE! And it tasted incredible, especially with the apple and peach chutney.  Side dishes, which I wish would have come with the meal instead of having to dish out another $5 each were great never the less. I ordered the colcannon mashed potatoes, which we both enjoyed immensely. And my girlfriend ordered the whipped sweet potatoes which were awesome too.  All in all, I'd have to say that this restaurant will most definitely be visited again the next time we are in Vegas!",

The drunken onion rings was better but it wasn't the same caliber of quality that I expected. Maybe it was an off day but let's try again. I hate to end our food relationship.

My husband's Rib Eye was almost impossible to cut, and the small bits of meat were surrounded with large ribbons of fat. The mustard mashed potatoes, a $9.00 side dish, was a tiny bowl of gluey glop. I would have mentioned all this to the manager, but when I walked up to the host desk, he was busy flirting with the servers and pointedly ignored me.  In total, we had one ale and one glass of wine, one appetizer, and two entrees for $135.00, a complete ripoff at that price - or any price.",

Although I don't much care for the NYNY hotel in which it is located, I highly recommend starting your evening of debauchery w/ NFI. They always have a band playing Irish tunes, and a crazy Asian woman ( nightly regular) dancing a jig. Not sure what her story is, but she isn't even the wackiest \"thing\" you will run into here. On this particular visit, an older gentleman in his 60's came into the bar with an unusual date...... A six foot tall Marilyn Monroe impersonator, with a prominent Adam's Apple. Good Times. I sent him over a shot believing he needed it more than me. Makes for good entertainment, even if their alcohol prices are on the high side (even by Strip standards). Shot of the good stuff is $12, yikes! Interior is very authentic Irish, and the place seems to get crowded fast. Band usually plays from 8pm 'till midnight. Staff is friendly and efficient.",

There's a nice selection of Irish/English/Scottish brews on tap and live entertainment to boot.   This place is ideal if you want a lively scene and a couple of beers, but not up for the full club experience.",

However, this is not a True Irish bar experience, as there is no soccer playing on a lonely TV screen, no one is passed out on the bar, or in a booth, and \"dirty\" is not in the tittle.  It is a nice break from the piano bar across the way though.",

I really just wanted something close with decent food and based on the reviews that I read, this place seemed to fit the bill.  We were seated relatively quickly and the service was very good.  I ordered the horseradish crusted halibut with chervil butter and it was outstanding.  The fish was prepared perfectly and was probably one of the best halibut dishes that I've ever eaten.  We also split a side of goat cheese mashed potatoes.  They were quite good, but a little more goat cheese would have been nice.    The only negative about the experience were the guys that were seated next to us.  Loud, obnoxious, and obscene.  I'm no saint and use my fair share of colorful language, but this was ridiculous.  We ended up eating and paying quickly just to get away from them.  All in all, this was probably one of the better meals that we had while we were town.  I'd definitely recommend it.",

But went back 2 years ago and it was disappointing. They completely changed how they cook and prepare the Mac and cheese dish. This used to be my favorite dish. It was to die for!!!! So cheesy and the white cheese was super gooey and heaven in my mouth! It also came in a large bowl  but... That has changed. Now it comes in a small side dish, and it is not as cheesy. In fake it is kind of bland tasting. Also another staple that I used to order here was the fish and Chips. My last trip, fish was slightly over cooked, and came in a small cup with the chips, I felt like for the price it should have been a plate, not a small cup. And the batter on the fish was overcooked. I'm so bummed about how disappointing my last visit was. I will probably give it another chance sometime in the future, just because previous visits blew my mind with the Mac and cheese.",

The huge flaky pastry puff that covers the top is amazing plus once you break through the top what awaits you underneath is so amazing. I am not even sure how to describe it, it is just so good and a perfect Vegas hangover cure. What I really loved about it was that it was made with a tomato base vs cream. I am not usually a fan of pot pie for that reason. It made the pie seem a little lighter so you could indulge more in the yummy topping. The service was great, and if you can ask to sit outside so you can people watch. I can't wait to get back to Vegas just so I can visit again.",

If you like Irish pubs, you'll like Nine Fine Irishmen.   First, they have good Guinness. On a Saturday night, they will pour it quickly and in plastic cups. On a regular day, it's poured correctly and in the normal glass pint. Obviously, the latter is better.   However, those weekend nights are fun too. There is a cover of $5 for live music is great for Vegas. The band is fun - a mix of Irish and other musics, and they really get the bar going.   The food looked tasty, but I didn't have any. Service, even when it wasn't busy, was fine but not great.",

It was a business trip so one of my coworkers and I decided to make the most of it and do a little bar hopping.  The Irish Car Bomb is one of my favorite drinks and my coworker had never tried one before. We made it a point to start the night off with one of those bad boys. I figured there was no better place than an Irish pub to celebrate his first Car Bomb.  We showed up Sunday night around midnight and the place was completely packed. The first thing we both noticed was how the place reeked of B.O. Shortly after that we realized how the place was full of old men in their 60's or later. Keeping in mind that a lot of places don't serve Car Bombs, we held our breath and fought toward the bar.  The bartender was nice and attentive and made our drinks really quick. There was even a great Irish band playing on the small stage in the middle of the bar. Several drunken dancers just happened to be flailing about with sections of the crowd cheering them on. Even though most of the crowd was old, the vibe was fun and the music was actually really good. However, once we finished chugging our drinks we aimed for the door and on to the next place...",

All of a sudden after I order a beer they tell me to leave and stand in line. In line to come in and watch the fight!!  Like WTF. They kicked me out with my beer and I had to walk around the corner to stand in line for a spot to seat.   I go to every UFC event and have never had this  happen at any place. Not a good way to treat someone who's spending money in your establishment.  Spoke to a manager and he all but rolled his eyes at me. It's too bad because they have good food. The server there named Rosanna was very attentive.  However what I found is.. If you're not Irish or a local... Forget it. Not two effs will be given.  Live and learn.. Won't be back.",

Don't expect to get a full irish experience here. This is not an Irish pub with a group of locals who come down to the pub to drink and play folk songs. This is a Vegas attraction with high energy music, some with a folk spin on them and some with Irish roots.   Good place to pop in drink some Guinness and eat an appetizer before venturing on to your next stop.",

In the evening they do have live music often.  The food is ok. I ordered the Irish Nachos. They consist of fried potato slices topped with beer cheese sauce, chives, aioli and green onions. I chose to add steak. You get a good amount of food. It is more than enough for a meal for one. Several people could also spit it as an appetizer. The chips had solid flavor and were crisp enough. The toppings were all ok.  The service was ok. Our server was not rude, but also not overtly nice. It also would have been nice for her to come by a little more frequently.",

So we order our food from a waitress you can absolutely tell did not want to be there.. She gets out water after 15 min and soon after the food comes out. The only positive is that the food was truly delicious. The waitress did not take our empty plates after distinctly seeing we were done. I alerted her that we will have 2 people joining us and instead of bringing a couple of chairs and menus she gave a check and basically told us to leave.  We asked for some water for the table which took another 20 minutes to bring and that's after she left the pitcher on the table behind us to take care of a different table and told my husband to get it himself...  Overall, terrible service...  Sad..",

The Beer N' Cheese Dip appetizer and Brie platter were great (can you really go wrong with cheese?).

The bar/restaurant is fine but without the band, we would never go just for the food. We are fortunate enough to be locals so we go 2-3 times per month for the last 5 years.  I guess they are considering bringing in a Top 40 band...in an Irish pub.  And charging cover, go figure.  So, if they replace the Irish band at the Irish pub with top 40, we will follow Darryl and his band mates wherever they go.  And maybe it will be somewhere with cheaper beer and better seating.",

You just have to give it to NY NY for adding Nine Fine to their resort as it does fit in with their theme.   We had comp tickets to Ricky Martin at the Park Theater. So, I was thinking of a place to eat close by to Monte Carlo. This place fit the bill so the Pub it is. We were seated outside on the patio by the Brooklyn Bridge with live entertainment by our seats. Couldn't fault anything with that.   Our drinks were super strong coming from their cocktail menu. I ordered the lamb stew while my friend had the Irish Nachos. Everything was on par to what you'd expect to have in Ireland. Good 'ol food made with love. I wish we made more room before we ate because we couldn't finish the huge servings. Some days they have live entertainment in and out of their restaurant. I'll be at NY NY in a few weeks so I'll try something different on their menu. Thank God this restaurant is part of Mlife just so I can earn some points.",

Served on tap at room temperature with just the right amount of head. \"I'll have another, please!\"  Baked brie appetizer - $14 - served in a puffed pastry with whisky marinated cherries on top, with toasted baguette slices on the side. The Brie was warm, the pastry moist yet flaky. Another winner.   Can I go three for three?  Grilled salmon entree, with capers and tomato butter sauce. The fish was cooked perfectly, the sauce simple yet flavorful. A steal for $24.   Upon request, the waitress brought me some bread so I could sop up the sauce. It was a soda bread, which is an acquired taste, but it went very well with the tomato butter.   Overall an excellent evening - will definitely be back!",

If you're looking for actual music played in a fun environment this is the destination for you; not a laptop in sight and it's glorious. The house band, Ri Ra, is incredible and at this point seems to be the last great band on the strip. The only reason I make frequent trips to Vegas is to see them and hopefully it will stay that way for years to come.",

    "text": "Got to be honest with you. Las Vegas is the last place I would expect to find a great Irish pub but I'll be damned if they didn't make a liar out of me.  After having been privileged enough to visit Ireland, I'm always a little reluctant when it comes to Irish pubs in America because other than the Guinness, a lot of them really never come close to the experience that I enjoyed. Not to say they're aren't any, I just haven't found them. We've passed by this place many times in the past and never thought once of trying it out.  Located inside the New York, New York Hotel and Casino, we decided to give them a try because the wife wanted a Shepards Pie. Through the bar you see the usual: dark mahogany wood, Irish stouts, ales, and ciders on the tap, and thankfully Irish music playing.   We asked to be seated outside which is on the strip but I wished I would have stayed inside to keep the illusion. This place could really make you forget where you are. Oh well, the strip is always great for people watching.   Once seated I went with the cliche beer choice, a Guinness, and for the app we chose the fried sausages. Oh man! Whose idea was it to bread a sausage link and deep fry it? I want to shake their hand. This was awesome.  Next, I had me a Smithwicks and Corned Beef sandwich while the wife had the Irish breakfast. The corned beef was piled high on marbled rye and tasted great. We probably could have done with ordering entrees because of the size of the sausage app.   I think next time, and there will be a next time, we're going to just order apps cause they all looked really good. Man. I'm still kicking myself in the rear end for not trying this place sooner.  I think next time I'll just stay at the hotel so I can close the bar down one night.",

Accidents happen. When my husband paid the male bartender charged him for the beer and asked him if he wanted his 80 cents in change. He lsaid no. \"Are you sure you don't want your 80 cents back?\" He said it very loud and sarcastically. First of all the drink should have been comped. Secondly, don't expect a tip if you spill a drink over someone's stuff. Finally, don't be rude to your customers. Definitely won't be going back to this place again. Employee needs to learn manners and good old fashion Irish etiquette. Shame on this pub.",

We were able to get a table right away despite the place being quite crowded, but our table was out of view of the band that was playing. I ordered the Horseradish crusted mahi mahi taking the server's advice which was fantastic. Sides are ala carte so I ordered a separate side of French fries which were just ok for me since I had refer more crispy fries. My wife liked the fries though so it's really a matter of preference. My wife ordered the chicken pot pie, which she said was good and kind of like a soup. Very filling. The Irish band SinERiRa was playing which was amazing. The Irish songs they were playing were spot on and better than any other Irish band I've ever heard. They also threw in a handful of cover songs too which pleased the crowd quite nicely. The Irish dancer who appeared on some songs was a nice touch that completed the package. We typically try not to do the same thing twice in Vegas but I'd seriously consider coming back here to have a few drinks and listen to the music.",

We were seated pretty quickly, given water and who knows where the waiters and waitress were. This happened at 12:30 Sunday, August 26, 2018. We ended up going to the bar downstairs. The bar upstairs seems to be blind, the two guys seemed ready to serve anyone but my retired Air-Force MasterChief brother. He then came back to the table and waited for the waitress, finally she blessed us with her presence, he patiently told the waitress what happened and her response seemed like she was too busy and not surprised. To add to this one of the ladies in our group asked the waitress why she hasn't seen any waitress in a long time? Get this \"Your not supposed to be here\"!  Their staff sat us there!!!   I would avoid this place if you bring a group of people and you don't want to be embarrassed! Obviously the staff does not work for tips!!!",

I had the Irish Bangers which were very good.The grilled asparagus was also very tasty, the waiter thought it was a bigger size side but it was pretty small in our opinion. I went ahead and ordered the Brussel sprouts because I was still hungry. Unfortunately for some lame reason they add a gluten containing product to their Brussels so my wife couldn't enjoy them. They were decent but very salty. They offered a military discount which was great.",

We were seated in the upstairs bar area where we had a great view of TV which was showing the Cowboys vs. Eagles game. They had a few Irish beers on the menu although most of them were super over-priced. I ended up getting a pint of Guinness anyway though. Las Vegas is clearly not a beer mecca as beer selection was generally poor everywhere we went, even places not on the Strip.  To eat, we shared an order chicken wings and a plate of Irish nachos. The wings were underwhelming as they were not spicy in the least. They also cost like $2 per chicken wing which is insane. The Irish nachos were way better though. The beer cheese complemented the potatoes really well, and the richness of the cheese was freshened up by the green onions and chives. It was a very satisfying and creative take on nachos. I would definitely recommend ordering the Irish nachos.   Our server wasn't around much but we did manage to finish our meal just in time to get to the show on time.   Overall, this place was fine but I'm not sure if we would return.",

Didn't offer to replace the drink (which hadn't been touched) or even apologize.  Super rude.  Expect better service, especially on the strip.  I guess we will not come back any time soon.

In fact, the attention to detail in making a legitimate-seeming Irish restaurant made me somehow forget where I was and I expected to see 3rd Avenue when I walked out the door rather than a Vegas casino floor.  Children dancing ecstatically, old men tapping their feet, and pretty girls twirling away: this place is on part with most real Irish restaurants I've tried.

    "text": "The food and service that the GF and I received here makes me cringe as I am writing this review.  We asked to be seated outside because it was such a nice night out.  That was the first big mistake.  After being seated, I noticed that there was only one server working the entire outside area.  There were at least six or seven tables occupied.  She gave us water and came back fifteen later.  We decided to order the fried mac and cheese, the pot pie, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn.    Food took an extremely long time to make its way to our table.  The mac and cheese came out first.  It was crispy on the outside, and soft and gooey inside.  This seemed like a fantastic preview of the quality of food that was to come.  However, the mac and cheese would be the only part of the meal.  The pot pie, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn came out next.  The pot pie was served in an actual pot, with the lavish pastry puff on top.  The pastry was good, but the inside was disappointing.  For the record, expect tomato soup inside the pot pie because that was exactly what it looked/tasted like.  We did not get bowls to share the pot pie.  Nor did we get any spoons for the two sides.    It took a long time for the server to check up on us so the GF walked up to her and asked her.  She said that she was busy taking orders with her current table... After a while, she made her way to our table and asked us what we wanted.  We asked for bowls and spoons.  I am going to assume no one has ever asked her about bowls because she was beyond puzzled.  It took her awhile to understand what we were talking about.  She said she did not have any bowls, but would get some spoons.  She again, took her time bringing the spoons to our table.  As for our sides, the mashed potatoes were bland.  The creamed corn was also bland.For dessert, we had the bread pudding.  It was very tasty, and quite the presentation.    It makes me sad knowing that the appetizer and dessert were better than the main course and sides.  I really expected more from this place.  In all honesty, I don't blame the server.  Lack of competence starts from the top down.  Management is at fault here.  They need to hire more workers, and check quality of food being brought out.    Bowls are necessary for the pot pie.  One probably should't finish the entire thing by his/herself.  Plates are not ideal in sharing the pot pie because of the soup inside.  Time for this place to invest a few dollars and get more dinnerware.    What a shame.",

They also have a pretty good selection of other alcohol.   I came for an event and we were placed on the second floor. They have a large bar on the top floor and that night they were featuring three whiskeys. I can only remember two of them, but those two were Jameson and Bushmills. Both were great, but I think I'm just more used to drinking Jameson.   They also had a large cheese platter and dessert platter. They had about 4 cheese to choose from and a couple sides that go along with the cheese. I really liked the one that was a mix of huge garlic, herbs, and oil. They also had several different types of grilled vegetables. They had about 8 different types of dessert and I was determined to try every single one. All of the desserts were small in size. I would say a couple bites worth each.   Since I came for an event I'm not really sure if all the appetizers and desserts are on the regular menu, but I had a great time here and I would definitely visit again when I come with friends.",

Both meals were cooked perfectly.  The short ribs provided a generous portion and 2 people could actually share unless you want leftovers.  The bacon was a nice touch to the potatoes and short rib. The cream corn was so so.  I think it's just not my cup of tea.  You have to ask for Irish soda bread and the butter sat in an oil that had a rosemary or sage flavor I didn't care for.  We split dessert since we were taking leftovers home and saw alot of positive reviews on the bread pudding, so we have it a try. I am not a big fan of bread pudding so this was something I had just a bite of.  They serve it hot in a mug and the server empties it out on your plate.  It is hot and you pour the sauces over it. The dessert wasn't bad, but it just wasn't my preference.  It is large enough to share for sure. Rated only 4 due to the fact you have to pay extra for sides, the oil on the bread was just ok",

I have no idea what is going on in the kitchen, but it tasted like frozen sausages that had been microwaved. All rubbery and totally without flavor. Yuck. The meal came out in under ten minutes, so that alone tells me they didn't prepare this meal properly. F you, charge me $19 for this slop.  Even the Guinness was awful. See the attached photo. This is not how a properly poured Guinness looks. And the wanker who poured it had a thick Irish accent. So either he just doesn't care, or wanted to mess with me.   Two stars because it is fun here, cool live music, and a nice patio on the strip. But just be aware of what you are walking into.",

    "text": "Nothing personal against Nine Fine Irishmen...this review is more about ALL Irish pubs in general.   WTF is the big allure with Irish pubs? Drunk, aggro mooks swilling dark-ass beer and eating grotesque, high-sodium high-fat carb-heavy food in a frenzied, fake-ethnic Animal House atmosphere. WHY???????  I was coerced into having lunch here the other day, and it was GROSS. I thought I'd be OK just ordering a good old-fashioned cheeseburger. Little did I know, the Irish apparently slop garlic mayo all over everything, and even a simple cheeseburger isn't good enough without adding a layer of some kinda weird flesh-bacon on top of the regular meat patty.  Aside from the food, I find the atmo at Irish pubs to be INSUFFERABLY ANNOYING. All that dark wood paneling, hearty waitresses, manically jovial Irish music blaring from the jukebox....it's my own private version of hell! Secret fact about me: I looooove holidays, but on St. Patrick's Day I crawl into a hole and HIDE -- all that green beer and all those drunk idiots make me want to VOMIT.  The sole exception to my anti-Irish-pub stance is O'Shea's...because it's more of a shithole dive bar than a pub, they keep the wood paneling to a minimum, Irish music is almost NEVER played, and my friend Brian works the door in a leprechaun costume.   I'll reserve my VERY infrequent Irish-bar hankerings for O'Shea's! With any luck, I will never set foot in 9 Fine Ri Ra Paddy MacGillicuddy's Krazy Old-Tyme Potato-n-Whiskey Shack again!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Ugh!",

You can ask to be seated upstairs if you want a slightly quieter dinning experience, as the bar area can get a tad loud. The specials are always interesting. Enjoy!",

I had their fish and chips that were tasty  but in my opinion overpriced for 2 pieces of fish and some fries for $23.  Their sides are tasty and fairly large and sharable for two.  I tried their goat cheese mashed potatoes and their tasty mac and cheese.  They are a little pricey and  their sides are sold separately at $6 for 1 item and  2 for $9, but the trick is to share them because they are enough for 2 people.  Overall the food and service is good and  the sides are large enough to share so if you order right you will have plenty of food that will balance out in price.",

    "text": "I love the atmosphere at Nine Fine Irishmen (and have given an extra star mostly because of it) but the food leaves a bit to be desired.   What I lived:  I really enjoy the live music they have there (saw the Celtic Rockers most recently and thought they were pretty decent) and I like the cosy seating that some spots in the restaurant have to offer.  There service that I've had has been pretty decent too.   What I didn't like:   The food portions were huge and on paper looked promising. In reality though, the dishes we had lacked flavor and weren't nearly as interesting as the descriptions might lead you to believe. We ordered \"drunken onion rings\" that boasted a bloody mary marinade that the rings didn't have the slightest hint of. We also ordered the pork tenderloin, which while probably the best dish we tasted, was mostly show. I ordered the Blue Cheese steak which was incredibly disappointing; it lacked any seasoning and relied instead on the blue cheese and the horrid au jus style sauce to give it any flavor, but it wasn't enough. It was a huge cut of meat and I would gladly have had half the food with a little better quality and preparation.    I ordered the \"dubliner\" after dinner and while it had Jameson listed as it's first ingredient, it was completely imperceptible to either of us (it tasted like a sickeningly sweet appletini). We'd ordered Jameson neat before dinner and I get the feeling that they cut cost corners by being stingy on the whisky; not a good practice for an \"irish\" bar. The waitress, to her credit, had it remade (it came back entirely different the second time) when she noticed that I wasn't drinking it and she took it off of our bill.    Perhaps my latest visit was an off night; I've had better from them in what now feels like the distant past. I'll probably go back again for the live music, dessert and  (simple) drinks, but I won't drop another $100 for dinner there again without some proof of redemption.",

No sooner did the beer come \"management' switched channels and put on soccer.  Ugh. After asking the bar tender if she can put the game back on she said she'd ask and 15 min later it was back on. Friends showed up, had a few beers before dinner and watched the rest of the game.  Three of us ordered the Jalapeno and bacon wrapped meatloaf.  We were all a bit disappointed as you couldn't taste any spice and there was only one little piece of bacon.  The meatloaf looked like a big meatball and was rather bland. Don't skimp on the peppers and bacon!!!   Bartenders were prompt but it was pretty slow for a Thursday evening.  Sadly we left just as the live music was starting and they sounded good.",

We were never offered the food menu, left sitting for a long time waiting on the waitress to come back to us. One of our drinks was a coke which was disgusting, tasted like mold. Tried to pay for our drinks at the bar but had to wait for the waitress to return 10 minutes later.

Scared, go for a salad. Salad at a pub? I won't fault you, I have done it.   I had made a reservation for after Zumanity. With Yelp and Open Table this process could not be anymore easy. I had originally used Yelp to look up their number, but found that I could just input a few simple answers and have a table waiting for us.   When we got their at 9:20, they were ready for us and guided us upstairs. Originally disheartened because their was a live Irish band downstairs, we trudged upwards. The pout soon was replaced with glee when we saw our little private alcove though. This table set in the back of the top floor is perfect for parties of 6-8. It is away from all of the chaos, but you can still hear the music.  The Big Appetizer Platter ($18) is a large mountain of wings, onion rings, sausage, and deep fried sausages. It sounded so good with the beers, but not so much as the night progressed. The Steamers ($14) was the best starter. These little morsels drew in all the garlicy/tomato flavor of the broth and added a nice saltiness once they opened up. The Beer and Cheese Dip is like eating a bowl of warm brie. It is decadent and rich. Smothered on bread, it will render you immobile for a while.   For a proper hen night (we ran into British people who called it that), the $5 shots of Jameson was an inexpensive way to get the bride plastered. All of the usual beers are here, but the mixed drinks are good for people who might not normally like beer, Snakebite (Harp and Magners Apple Cider), Black 'N Black (Guiness and Black Currant), Black Velvet (Guiness and Magners) made the bride happy.",

A definite must visit in Vegas!",

They have imported Guinness from Dublin here so thats kind of nice if you know the difference between American Guinness and Irish Guinness.  My wife had an apple martini that she thought was too strong...but she isn't much of a drinker so I tried it and it was definitely too strong.  Did not try the food, but again this place is just a  gimmick bar inside a luxury casino hotel. Enjoy it for what it is...an excuse to drink.",

It may not be \"authentic\" as some have groused about, but it is a fun, cozy atmosphere.   I had the Bangers & Mash. Tasty. The serving was a tad small. (There was only one banger and the \"roasted vegetables\" the meal was said to have come with were minuscule and hidden between the banger and the mash.)   The husband had a full Irish breakfast, which, to his surprise, came with black and white puddings, which were not listed on the menu. He had no desire to eat either. I had never tasted these, so seized this opportunity. They did not repulse me; they were just kinda blah. So, now I can add these to the things I have done once and don't need to do again.   We stopped in here again on our last day in Vegas for a drink. Sat at the bar. I was drinking wine and my husband was sipping a cider, so we don't have first hand experience, but the bartender looked to mixing up some mighty strong drinks.   I probably won't return only because I don't see myself going back to Vegas any time soon. But, we're glad we stopped in and got to spend some time here.",

I got myself a pint and the bangers and mash.  It should have been called Banger and Mash, because there was only one sausage.  The portion seemed incredibly small for 13 bucks, but what the hell do I know.  Maybe they had to fly that stuff all the way from Ireland.  I thought the selection of on-tap beer seemed adequate.  Some people who walked in were real happy they had Smithwicks on tap.  I must really have my timing wrong because hardly anyone was in here when I came in.  Altho all the serving staff seemed to be busy, but they were folding napkins, stocking the bar, etc.  The food I had was really good.  A little pricey at 24 bucks total for a beer and that one sausage and a little mashed potatoes.  Oh well, I'll be back here on St Patty's Day and we'll see what they have to offer then.",

The place itself is set up to be unique and stylish in its own kind of way. Its like a pub, with its own Irish twist to it. Even though it may have been a small place, the layout and scenery made the place interesting. I really like the uniqueness of the dining area and the service was good.   Of course, going to a restaurant, where I have no clue what is on the menu. It sure does bring your curiosity level to new heights. But, I decided to have the Fish and Chips, which is probably the only thing I recognize on the menu. Also a great tasting Gaelic Punch, an alcoholic drink with Cruzan Banana Rum, Malibu, Midori, Raspicello, OJ, Pineapple, and splash of Sierra Mist, is a drink I would like to have again. The Fish and Chip was great, but when the wife shared her Shepard Pie, which was a big portion for her to finish. I just love the way it tasted.  I wish I was more curious to order a Shepard's Pie, then the Fish and Chip. If I could, I would of finish the Shepard Pie, but I after indulging my Fish and some chips, I was a bit full to finish that Shepard Pie. With the fact of us being full, we were unable to have dessert. But how things turned out to be, I'm sure dessert would of been \"icing on the cake\".   This was a new experience for me, which I totally approve on going to, and seeing it for yourself. Sure enough, I do plan to revisit this place and order me my own Shepard Pie, Gaelic Punch and next time around, I'll even order a dessert regardless how full I am.",

They did offer to replace the soup.   The fish and chips were good - enough to share between two people.  The reuben was good too but I think I still prefer pastrami.  Bread pudding dessert was delicious and even though my friend was full on the meal, he couldn't resist devouring the dessert.  Overall we enjoyed our lunches.",

My spice grilled pork porterhouse with apple and peach chutney was well worth the wait (as the waitress had advised)! The King cut bone-in ribeye with roasted shallots and baby tomatoes was also mouth watering! Sides are so yummy and great to share so get two of them! Then for the following lunch went with seafood chowder and irish beer and cheese dip with an assortment of bread.  Seafood chowder tasted creamy and the clams, mussles and fish were soaked in the creamy white wine broth.  And is it just me or does beer just taste so much better on tap?",

The food is A-Ma-Zing for traditional irish pub grub. I strongly recommend the onion rings, which are marinated in a bloody mary mix prior to  being guinness beer-battered and then served up with spicy brown mustard. Yum!  Had the Shepherd's pie which is served in (for lack of a better term) a tin bucket-pretty cool. I have to say, the shepherd's pie paired perfectly with my yellow jacket (Guinness floated on top of shock-top hefeweizen). So delicious.  Was too full for dessert!",

Entertainment: 4 stars - When we were there, a group who played Celtic music, but also took requests and were funny and laid back were playing. Enjoyed them very much.   Food: 4 stars - We went with the Restaurant Week prixe fixe meal. Our starters were a mixed green salad with a fabulous dressing and drunken onion rings which were delicious, not greasy, and were accompanied by a delicious mustard based dipping sauce. For the main course, we had the fish and chips and Irish bangers. The bangers with cabbage over mashed potatoes were not only thoroughly Irish (or at least British), but were also very tasty and fit solidly in the category of comfort food. The fish and chips were horribly plated (fries on top of the fish in a cone shaped vertical stand which forced you to dig through the fries to get the to the fish and resulted in the fish getting a bit too much steam/moisture), but the batter did not feel greasy, the tarter sauce had great flavors, and the half lemon wrapped in a sort of fine cheesecloth to avoid seeds and pulp popping into your food was a nice touch. For dessert, we both had the butter and caramel bread pudding and it was 5 stars - all the way. Absolutely buttery, melty, semi-sweet heaven on a plate with excellent presentation.   Service: 4 stars - Our waitress was attentive and my glass never got empty. She could have been a bit more friendly, but still, she did a great job.   Price: Quite reasonable. The three course prix fixe meal was $30. Definitely great quality food for the price.",

Probably a little too clean and neat for an authentic pub, with polished cherry-stained wood all over!  What I had...  Chips and Dips - Sliced / Fried Potatoes in an aluminum pot with dips two dips made from Curry and another dip with unknown ingredients. Interesting to say the least.  Lump Crab Cakes - The remoulade dip was what made this starter stand out. Without the dip, though, the Crab Cakes could not have stood out on their own.  Shepherd's Pie - I told myself I'm going all authentic tonight! Let's try the Shepherd's Pie! Not authentic, with a few variations that would not confuse anyone that they were in an Irish Pub. The Port Wine sauce and vegetables makes this entree interesting, but definitely not authentic. Also served in an aluminum pail.  Bailey's Creme Brulee - Pure 100% Bailey's... and nothing else. If you didn't get a buzz from the bar drinks... this \"dessert\" could cause you problems!  Black and Tan Cake - Very good. Would order this dessert over the Bailey's anytime.  An Irish band, Ri Ra, was playing this night and LOUD it was.   The waitress / barmaids were cute in their RiverDance type of uniforms. Would not mind coming here more just for this...  In summary... The environment might be authentic, but not the atmosphere... definitely a Las Vegas feel to the whole evening. AND Bring LOTS of money, and some ear muffs to muffle out the noise which is tremendous when the Irish band is playing. And even when the band is not playing, the noise is tremendous!  If New York, New York wants this to be authentic... bring over a dart-throwing area, and some TVs showing soccer or rugby matches for starters.",

The interior is pretty cool.   The food is expensive and the portions are fairly large.  I had the lamb stew and it was disappointing because the broth was a broth and not a thicker near gravy like one would expect.  The lamb was tender but the pieces were so large they had to be cut to eat them.  (Seriously, one piece was the size of badminton shuttle).  My husband had the BMT (bacon, mozarella and tomato on panini bread) and that was probably the best thing at the table.  Seems surprising, but it was excellent.  One person ordered the Irish nachos (fried potatoes instead of tortilla chips with corned beef on top) and those were quite good.  Another ordered the steamers which were steamed mussels in a tomato broth, also good.  Our server was a little manic and laughed like a lunatic at everything we said.  Granted, we are a pretty funny group (if I do say so myself) but we're not that funny.  So it was a bit unnerving.    But any place that has Magner's on tap is probably going to get three stars from me just on principle.",

The Mahi Mahi off the dinner menu is superb.  Lots of choices in Vegas...I choose this one every time.",

The service was awesome & our waitress, Sam, was the best- beauty AND brains. Must be in the name (; She recommended The Beer Cheese Dip- on POINT! Served bubbling hot with an assortment of crackers and breads. The Corned Beef Nachos-- what a concept! Awesome CB smothered in sauces on top of not corn chips, but decedent potato crisps! Slap yo mama good.   I'd definitely come back for HH!",

Yes, which is probably why I've never eaten there in the many years I've come to Vegas. Would I go back and pay full price? Absolutely! Worth every penny!

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews on Yelp, but after last night's dinner at Nine Fine Irishmen, I had to come on and share. My dad and I have been coming to Nine Fine Irishmen for around 4 or 5 years. The first time we ever visited, we were amazed at how much food we got. My dad had the fish and chips and I had the shepherd's pie. Every year that we've come back, we've gotten the same things and have always been pleased. The service has always been hit or miss, but the food kept us coming back. Sadly, last night's trip was a major disappointment and we are probably not going to ever return.  As per usual, my dad ordered the fish and chips and I ordered the shepherd's pie. The meal came out decently fast and our waitress took acceptable care of us. When the food arrived however, we were not pleased. What had once been a massive helping of fried fish and French fries had become two small strips of fish and a handful of floppy fries. My shepherd's pie looked the same, but the beef was no longer anything special, but tasted instead like a hamburger that had been broken up and drenched in mashed potatoes. The generous pieces of carrot that had been mixed with the beef on our previous visits had been reduced to small (and I mean minuscule) pieces of what I think may have been carrots, they were honestly too small to even be sure.  After we picked at our food for a half hour, my dad decided to ask the waitress what had happened to the fish and chips and she explained that they had gotten a new chef and that he had traded out regular cod for Alaskan cod. For $23, I would say that the Alaskan vs. whatever cod they were using before is definitely not worth the price. Don't waste your time here, go to Ri Ra in the Mandalay Bay instead. We are so sad that our favorite Irish pub is no longer living up to what it was before.   Honestly, DON'T LISTEN TO THE POSITIVE REVIEWS. If you want to spend over $20 a person on subpar food then visit, but if you are looking for big, delicious portions then don't waste your time.",

You get half a sausage, half a piece of bacon. So many potatoes u don't know what to do with and even sweet potatoes. How's that Irish? Very disappointed!

I know I went to the Vespar Bar at the Cosmopolitan, another bar at Cesar's, then another bar in New York New York. I walked across the floor to Nine Fine Irishmen and was greeted with the sounds of a live Irish band singing \"Drunken Sailor\" (yes, I know the words!)   After about a minute, the bartender, who was very busy helped me out. I asked about the different types and ages of the Irish whiskies that there were and he was very helpful in recommending an 18 year-old whisky (I forgot the name) and it...was...smoooooooth!!!  After about three of four more, I sobered up and made the trek up to my room. I also woke up with three kids running around the suite with no hangover. My trick? After each drink of alcohol, drink water afterwards. You stay hydrated and you don't have cottonmouth the next day.",

Our party of three sat for about 15-20 minutes before our server finally noticed us.  Started with the baked Brie which was tasty and the bourbon soaked cherries and balsamic drizzle set it off nicely.   The herb grilled chicken looked promising, but came out dry, the glaze almost saved it but not quite. Couldn't bring myself to try the mushroom muffin but an order of mushrooms as a side helped.   The lamb stew had decent flavor but was more of a soup with very little substance and the shepherds pie was overall unimpressive which saddened me after the hype from other customers.  Creamed corn had so much heavy cream in it, it was closer to tapioca than anything else and the lack of any other spice including salt made the texture strange and overall inedible.   Take home story: come for the booze and live music. With so many other options for food, this one is tolerable, but not worth seeking out.",

Two of the people in our group order the pot pie and it looked amazing.  I got the tomato salad. The balsamic vinegar was a bit overwhelming, but the cheese and tomatoes were very good.

Once seated service was hit or miss (unfortunately  leaned toward the miss side) the gratuity no longer left up to the servers capability is charged at 20%, no matter how big the party is attached to your check, so can't penalize servers for poor to no service.  Reorders on drinks lacked greatly  so when  we decided to have a beer (which you would think is where they would make money-service was not even available) the food servers were quick to make certain you had your items and brought any pickups quickly.  Best suggestion is to avoid unless drunk and prepared to order two drinks at a time.  This was 3:30 -6 on a Tuesday not even prime dinner time or cocktail hour so be alerted ahead of time. When we pass later in the evening they were quiet full and table clearing seemed not happening as other guests were sitting with tables full of dirty dishes and empties.  It seems when restaurants remove your ability to tip service lacks a great deal, but the food was great!!!!",

I highly recommend dropping in if you want to avoid those dissapointing buffets Vegas is known for.",

I then got a steak salad which was amazing. I never thought I'd get so pumped about a salad but I would get it again in a second. The drinks where just as good and they where larger than I expected. The waitress was super nice and funny. My friends and I all agree this was the best meal we had in a while.",

The new arrangement of the bar accommodated more people, and the outside was closed for construction.  But the food was great, and the pints were properly poured.    I've been there early with my daughter and would even recommend it for families if you're there before the late crowd starts getting loose.",

    "text": "I came here on a recommendation that the fish and chips were better than another place that I love.  So I was expecting to be blown away, I was greatly disappointed.  Not only were the fish and chips not better than the other place I love it they just weren't that good.  The fish was really bland almost as if the batter was just flour and beer, it was just flavorless.  Of the multiple orders of fish and chips we ordered several pieces had that layer of skin that would be left if you pretty much only removed the scales.  It's ok to eat, but it was kind of like eating a sheet of something brittle between the fish meat and the batter.  Another piece was soggy and when picking it up the skin just tore away chunks of fish fell off.  We were all disappointed in the fish and chips.  If they tasted better, they would have been a great deal, three large pieces of fish for about $16 bucks.  If you are looking for fish and chips look else where, the other food might be better, but I won't be coming back to find out.",

    "text": "This place needs some work, but I'm rating it on the food and drink which were sublime.   It's in New York, New York right off of the casino floor. When we got there, no hostess, I walked in and walked around confused for a while. Finally I walked back out and two ladies were positioned at the hostess stand. The hostess was pretty pompous and cold, standard issue \"I'm doing you a favor by you being here...\" eastern european from what I can tell, if you're going to be rude, at least be native to the theme of the restaurant, LOL!  OK great, she gets us a table in the pub area. No one comes around, I walk up to the bar. Pretty cool barman tells me he'll send some one over and some menus too. Finally a slow clueless but somewhat friendly waitress comes over, I ask her about the menu, she kind of stares back like she doesn't know what I'm talking about. I order a pint of the black stuff and ask for another minute.   Not a lot of Irish happenin on this menu. One lamb stew, one clam dish (with a tomato broth??) it's not that enticing. I order the clams and proceed to drink. The pogues come on the jukebox and I start drinking more and more then the food comes, WOWWWWW, the clams are out of this UNIVERSE, and I usually prefer mussels, this were a revelation. People were probably staring at me like I was a pig... annnnnd I am.   Had a bite of the wings (why are they on this menu???) but there were DELISH!!! I had a convo w/ the barman and said hey man, you've got beautiful fresh guinness on tap, a chef/cooks that clearly know what they're doing, and this staff (aside from him) that don't seem to be at all focused on the people or the theme of the place and a really dumb menu. Get it together! Oh and you have to have a deeper scotch selection, Irish Whiskey is good, but you HAVE to have a full whiskey bar w/ bourbon and scotch in an Irish restaurant. This place could be sublime, but not quite there....",

The steak was good... Not great, but good... It had a bit more gristle than I was expecting, but that happens sometimes with the particular cut I chose. It was tougher though than it should have been...  The Mac and cheese was great, rich, creamy and steaming hot! The colcannon mashed potatoes however were not the greatest... and none to hot and unfortunately the waiter was gone long enough that it wasn't worth waiting to get it changed out for new stuff.... You know when mashed potatoes sit to long on a line and they get that over starched hardness... Think that, but cold, with mixed in cold uncooked cabbage and ham.    The rest of the meal went rather well... The atmosphere was a bit darker than I would have cared for.. In fact it was hard to see the stairs... I can deal with darkness in a restaurant at the table... But the stairs, is usually a good place to keep things rather well lit.   MyVegas we behind on the viva launch and had only one POS terminal setup... As such my first receipt did not have a Viva code, I talked to the waiter about the program and he gladly reprinted my receipt on a terminal with the viva integration...   Overall my experience was pretty good... However nothing I would write home about, and it was below my initial expectations... I personally would go there again and give them a second chance to see if things improve. Nothing scared me off...",

Tell Marie Calendars to go back to her kitchen because Nine Fine Irishmen chicken pot pie is the best you will ever have. I have had their shepherd's pie in the past and it's awesome too. The deep-fried sausages is a sinful savory delight. OMG these little tender sausages dipped in a wonderful dipping sauce it's hard to stop eating them. Steamers were in a wonderful sauce that worked really well with the clams. However, what made the whole night so great this time was our wonderful waitress Tracy! She educated on things such as the restaurant, Ireland, and more. She was fun, funny and loved her New York accent. A special shout out to you Tracy, Thank you for making our night in Vegas.  So needless to say, service was awesome! Also note, I have dinner here every time I come to Vegas without fail and I have never had a bad meal. If you're not eating here, you are missing out!",

I had to grab the hostess to get malt vinegar, yeah a pub that does not even have malt vinegar on the tables.  The Irish band was great and they had an Irish dancer that was great and not so, omg, riverdance.  They have some really fake looking busts of nine famous Irishman high up on a wall, I saw no signs identifying any, probably Thomas Swift was one of them.  Beer was three types of Guiness, Smythwicks', Newcastle, a hard cider, and other beers, no Murphy's.  The band starts at 9:15, they really get the crowd going, some danced.

I've had the burgers which are out of this world and the heirloom tomato salad with goat cheese, blue cheese and farmhouse cheese - good but I wouldn't get it again.

    "text": "I had the best time here. Not only was the band great, but so were the people. My friend and I got chummy with this group of Irish guys that were seriously out of control.  They were jumping on eachother and pouring drinks on eachother it was great. I dont think I have seen anyone ever fake swim on the ground of a bar. Then they go kicked out and it sucked until they sneaked back in...then one of them got thrown out by the neck, but besides that it was a grand time, I want to go back reaal bad.",

    "text": "We went here for my 30th birthday dinner this past Saturday.  I am SO glad I made reservations a couple of days ahead of time because the place was packed.  We were even running late and I called so they wouldn't give the table away, which they appreciated.    A couple of things happened that prevented me from giving it 5 stars.  First off the reason I booked this place was because of the live music on Saturday nights.  Well, we must have been there too early because they had the ball game on instead.  Second, we ordered 3 drinks from the bar.  My friend got his right away but my boyfriend and I didn't even get our Guinnesses until after we got our meal 20 minutes later and that was after we reminded our server that we still needed our drinks.     Anyways, I had the Shepards Pie and it was very very good!  The meat had a wonderful flavor.  We will definitlely be back!",

    "text": "Nine Fine Irishmen was an amazing restaurant.  It combined a great atmosphere, delicious food and even an Irish band!  We had the cheese dip with a variety of bread and it was a great appetizer.  For our entree's, I had the Shepard's PIe and my date had the fish and chips.  At first I didn't think the Shepard's Pie would be filling enough.  However, after eating a third of it, I realized how hearty those meat and potatoes were and it was a perfect amount.  I highly recommend Nine Fine Irishmen if you're looking for a great Irish Pub and unique experience in Vegas.",

    "text": "I grew up in Boston - I think we have the monopoly on Irish bars.  Anyway, Nine Fine Irishmen is alright - they serve Guinness, but it's bloody expensive (too expensive).  It's got an interesting decor, gets a bit crowded, and live Irish music is always a treat.  Anyone out there that is sick of spending big bucks on Newcastles, head down to the old Barbary Coast for 99 cent ones - draft beers, it's all the same.  Not a place I would want to camp out in, but this bar would do to kill an hour or two.",
