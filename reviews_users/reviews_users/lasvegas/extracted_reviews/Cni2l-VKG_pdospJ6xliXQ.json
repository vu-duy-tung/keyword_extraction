    "text": "I come here quite often due to the fact I have a bartender that works here and I work a few stores down. I give it 4 stars. Reason why?   Answer: all the burgers are cooked to the way you want it. Burgers can be customized-there is no limit. THIS IS NOT A FAST FOOD BURGER! so if you're expecting a $2 ... don't enter this establishment. I believe the burgers are priced right especially for the quality. Presentation is great as well. If you are unsure of what to order... ask. Every time I keep coming here, the menu seems to expand. A year ago (or less) they didn't have a desert section...now they do! Staff is very outgoing providing a laid back experience. However, don't always expect the staff to be there for every refill... They may have a habit of socializing amongst each other. (now I'm not sure since there are many new faces) Seating is very cramped especially sitting in the tables that are in the middle of the restaurant. Normally I sit at the bar... Much more comfortable.",

I wasn't a HUGE fan of the bun but overall the burger was juicy, well cooked and very satisfying. The fries and onion rings were also great.  But the best part was the black & white milkshake. OMG was it worth the calories.   This was a fun restaurant to go to. Everything is solid and although it's not the \"best\" burger I've ever had, I think it's a MUST GO for vegas.",

In the end, I realized I prefer In 'n' Out.  I just got bleu cheese, avocado, and bacon on my burger, and the bacon was crispy and spectacular. As a whole though, it was just okay. Considering we spent more than $50 for two burgers, two orders of fries, and one soda, I was unimpressed.  I've also tried Burger Brasserie and Gordon Ramsay BURGR, and I found them to both be delicious, unique, and worth the outrageous cost. But Burger Bar just didn't do it for me. I'll give it another shot if someone insists but will never choose this place on my own.",

The burger was overcooked which always bothers me, as the meat loses its flavor when it is burnt.  I like Kobe burgers and this one tasted like nothing more than a middle of the road restaurant burger.  The sweet potato fries were nothing to write home about either.  Just a note, I got my burger on a ciabatta bun and I would not recommend this, as it was too dry and really took away from the burger.    Chef veggie burger with buttermilk zucchini fries was also pretty blah as far as the burger is concerned, but the zucchini fries were pretty good, these I would recommend.  All in all I would not recommend this place nor come back to it.",

Damn, I can't imagine getting a burger for $60, but to each their own!    I get my angus burger on ciabatta bread and order bacon to be added.   For drinks, try their Strawberry Mojito.  Yummy!

Busy place on the weekend (like almost every place on the Strip) but they do have a rather large bar (runs from the front of the bar almost all the way to the back) so if you have a smaller party, belly up to the bar for faster seating and service.

Me and two other friends went too concert headed up too Burger Bar. I always wanted too check it out just never got around too it. Now knowing location so close too House of Blues looking for greasy food soak up the alcohol Burger Bar solid solid choice.   It was my first time so had no idea the menu worked. None of us have ever been here so asked our waiter questions. He did awesome job of explaining everything too us. You can either build your own burger or go with ones that have on the menu. We optioned for the the ones that not build your own cause other ones it comes with fries. Maybe the build your own does but as far from my four PBR recollection or more  in could is negative. LOL!  I had the Peppercorn Burger. It was awesome. I know drinking but still the balance between the dijon mustard spread and the peppercorns (plus the peppercorn cream sauce serve on the side; put some of that cream-a-licous on top) slice tomato, lettuce, and onion. It was nice hearty burger at the perfect time in life. The burger meat was cooked perfect medium. The only thing that was disappointment was the fries was average at best. The burger which reality is the reason come here was Awesome.   Service could not say what an amazing job our waiter did! Not only with the questions. Two of my friends had the craving for nice over easy egg on top of their Hangover burger. You can add too the burgers already on the menu item ones. One of my friends notice his egg was way over done. The waiter apologize went back fixed the problem and came back with perfectly cooked over easy egg. You know perfect second break that seal have the egg yolk spreading all over its the bomb. Just knowing that do over easy egg right way on any burger. Always reason for me too go back!   Pricey. It Hubert Keller and on the strip so comes as no surprise. Too see $60 burger on menu blows my mind. Still most of the burgers average $15-20. I think your definitely getting quality burger. Fries could be better and meet the standards they set with the burgers. Just my take.",

Our drinks came out incorrectly...granted, one diet Pepsi, 3 waters and two sweet teas is a difficult order but at the same time, when told of the error, it took 7 minutes to get our accurate drinks.   Issue 3. The food was Luke warm for 3 of us and completely COLD for another. When we advised the waiter that the burger was cold, we told him that we didn't have time to wait and one of us didn't get a chance to eat lunch.   Issue 4. Upon inspection of the replaced burger in the car, the add ons that we paid for weren't on the \"fresh\" burger.   Issue 5. Our server must have joined the witness protection program because he came around as often as Haley's Comet.

It also didn't really have much flavor. And the total cost for 2 people was close to $60 (including taxation and tipping). The food wasn't bad. But if you're paying out $60, there is probably much better food elsewhere.",

I had the vegan veggie burger (I'm not even a vegan) which was grilled eggplant, capsicum (I think you call them red peppers here) zucchini, on a mushroom cap bun (no bread) and it was delicious and super filling!! My partner had the All American Classic which he loved as well.  The service was fabulous despite being packed and even allowed me to change my skinny fries to sweet potato fries a few minutes after I ordered without a hiccup. They had a great service where instead of just waiting they just messaged us when our table was free and we were seated 2 minutes after we put our names down.  Will we come back here? Definitely!!",

    "text": "We had a $50 food credit to use and thought that Burger Bar would give us the best bang for our buck. Burger Bar is located one level 2 in the Shoppes area of Mandalay Bay, not in the Fleur/1oak nightclub area. Got there for an early dinner on a Saturday and there was no wait. We called to put our name down but they said it was first come, first serve. I guess they changed their policy based on previous Yelp reviews where people made reservations.   We were seated at a booth which had a USB/110 on the wall! Perfect if you have your cable on you and have been depleting your battery while wandering around Vegas all day! Being the purist that I am, I went for taste and ordered the Kobe burger for $18 and added foie gras $13 which I can't get in California. The burgers come with lettuce, tomato, red onion and a pickle. K got the regular Angus for $10 with various toppings. We also got skinny fries for $4 and mozzarella sticks $7(!). The foie gras was pretty good and a decent portion for $13. It wasn't the best I had but it doesn't matter as much when you're smashing it on a burger. I had to have a few initial stand-alone bites. My burger was so juicy and flavorful, I just constructed it with the lettuce and tomato and that pretty much made it. Figured if I was paying $18 for a burger then I wanted to taste the burger and not a bunch of condiments. It was super filling too.   I had a few of the skinny fries which were just fries. K loved his mozzarella sticks but I don't think it's worth it for $7.   We had great service although when we asked about different menu items, she answered \"awesome\" to it all. Which was True but just hard to gauge the level of awesomeness for each item.   Prices weren't cheap but not too outrageous. I felt for a hotel restaurant and location, it was a good experience.",

The fries were the only hot items on our trays.  The burger was just OK and it was room temperature.  The wings were cold. We waited 40 minutes for our food. People that sat down next to us 10-15 minutes after we were sitting got there wings and burgers before us. I ordered a medium burger ao that didn't cause the delay.  Overall not the 4 star experience as stated here on Yelp. I was so excited.  I mean it is called the Burger Bar and burgers are my comfort food. I was not comforted nor happy.  I will not be coming back to this establishment and wouldn't recommend it to anyone.   The manager apologized and comped the wings and my beer but it still didn't make up for the bad experience.  Ahe said her kitchen was having a melt down. If your number one and main item is burgers then at least that should be good. I could have gone five guys for the same quality burger.  Sorry Burger Bar you did not live up to the Yelp hype for this burger connisuer.",

    "text": "After much debate we decided to make our own burger rather than choosing one of the burgers straight from the menu.   I chose the barbecued marinated beef with bacon,  sauteed mushrooms and blue cheese.   The Burger was juicy and cooked to perfection at a medium grill.   I could tell the beef was high quality however I couldn't taste any type of bbq marinade.   The bun I chose was the pretzel bun which was just the right texture,  chewy and tasty.   Sol chose a grass feed beef burger with bacon,  a fried egg and American cheese.  He had it put on a chibatta bun.  He had his burger well done which to me is too done but to each his own.   We also split a sweet potato fry.  Sol also ordered a side salad which was very disappointing.   It was lettuce and vignette,  that's it.   No other toppings.   Weird.   We drank water.   Alcohol drinks were on the menu for $12.50 each.   Milk shakes were $9 each.   They were good size but yikes!   Even the tea was $3.95, really?  For tea?     Our bill was $50 for 2 hamburgers, 1 order of fries and 1 side salad.  Even though the food was good,  it wasn't anything I couldn't have made at home.   Two thumbs up for the burgers.  Two thumbs down for the prices and the side salad.   Fries were fries.",

It was extremely flavorful. My husband, who loves a good burger, was also impressed. We would both like to return and try another type of meat. The only negative was the service. It wasn't awful but it definitely could have been better. We were sitting 2ft from the bar but it took forever to get a beer after we ordered and our server was just hanging out at the end of the bar talking with co-workers. That is kind of ridiculous.

    "text": "Thanks to all the great Yelp reviews and the fact that it was close to our hotel, we decided to try the Burger Bar. It was late when we went in for dinner, about 11:30pm or so. The restaurant was fairly empty, I think there were about 2 or 3 other tables that were occupied. Our waiter was helpful and seemed to be very busy.   The burgers here were so-so, nothing great but I've had better. My husband had a lamb burger which was nice, mainly because it came with spicy ketchup. The sliders I ordered were ok. They were a little dry, but not bad. I asked for some ranch with my fries and it came semi-frozen. We also ordered the Salted Caramel Milk Shake, which was excellent as was my husband's Mai Tai.",

While we had to wait for about 45 minutes to be seated, but once we were seated, the service and the food blew us away.   Our server was super nice, friendly, and attentive. The food server knew which of us ordered what, which I had not expected from such a casual place.  That's great service.   The burgers were simply amazing!  I made my own burger for almost $21 but it was worth every penny!  It was honestly the best burger I've ever had.   The drinks were also amazing as were the dessert milkshakes!!!  We've been to Hubert Keller's famed Fleur de Lys - that was wonderful, and this is an even better experience!!",

    "text": "Note: I'm a burger and beer gal.  I'm giving burger bar a 2 because the burger was just flat out not worth it. $24 for a mediocre burger? No thanks.  A few of us started with the american \"kobe\" beef as our foundation. I added guacamole, provolone, and bacon and a side of chipotle mayo to mine. First of all, to charge that much for \"kobe\" beef would typically lead a person to believe that it just *might* be worth the extra change. It wasn't. The meat tasted incredibly LEAN and dry, in fact, and it kind of showed when my meat patty crumbled into multiple chunks. What the?? Sadly, the toppings couldn't save the burger from its miserable demise as I tried to pick up its pieces and enjoy what I could.  The boyfriend's kobe burger didn't crumble, but one of the other kobe burgers that were ordered also suffered the same ending mine had. A fluke? Did they run out of the good meat and think it would suffice to give us the norm? Meh.  Whatever the case, I've had burgers 10x as good for less than half the price so burger bar was a complete fail.  As far as beer was concerned... nothing was appealing. I peeped out the bottle list just for fun and was completely taken aback by a $20something bottle of sculpin... you must be delusional.",

    "text": "See profile site for full review with formatted pics.  Perhaps it was Boulud, perhaps Keller.....at some point someone decided that a 99cent cheeseburger at McDonalds simply wasn't enough.  Foie Gras, Truffles, Shrimp, Lobster.....you name it, you got it.  While I do find it odd that I found myself being led into Burger Bar by my friend when I don't particularly like beef and don't eat burgers, I will admit to have had a few in the past and my all-time was the Thurman Burger in Columbus Ohio, a famous one in its own right.  In a day that included Tableau for breakfast and Alex for dinner I must say I didn't expect much from the Burger Bar....but I was pleasantly surprised.   While the Bar was located in a shopping mall at Mandalay Bay I didn't judge....most of Vegas feels like a mall anyhow and Per Se in NYC is located in a mall, as well.  Arriving around 2:30pm there was a line...a good sign I guess....our names were taken and 10 minutes later we found ourselves seated at a 4-top in the middle of the restaurant.  While the place was quite loud, conversation was quite easy and our menus were delivered quickly.  With 5-6 bread options, 5-6 meat options, 40-50 topping options, plus desserts it actually took longer to order than we had imagined.  Eventually I settled on the Turkey Burger on Ciabatta with grilled Shrimp, Pesto, and a side order of Sweet Potato fries while my buddy opted for the Kobe Beef Burger with Sharp Cheddar and Hickory Bacon on Whole Wheat with Spicy Skinny Fries and a sampler of beers.   As the place was busy we chatted for a bit and I decided to get up and explore.  Much to my surprise the kitchen was wide open for viewing and I wandered about to realize how fresh all the ingredients were, the bread being baked in visible ovens, and the meats stored in large lockers.  Everything appeared very hygienic and clean, very much unlike your average burger shack.  By the time I arrived back at the table my buddy was working on his beer and approximately two minutes later the food arrived.  While I spent a moment dressing my burger and eating my incredibly garlicky pickle spear, I heard my buddy partially-moan....clearly he was loving this burger.   Once my burger was adequately dressed and I had a large pile of ketchup for my fries it was time to dig in.  Crisp ciabatta with a fluffy interior first greeted my tongue followed by the wonderful basil blast of the pesto mingling with plump and tender shrimp and well cooked yet juicy turkey.  Great texture, quality ingredients, wonderful flavor, well cooked....what more can you ask for in a burger?  I next dug into the fries which were simply fantastic and #3 only to Michael Mina's Duck Fat Fries and Michael Symon's Lola Fries in terms of crispy outside and soft/salty inside.  I do find it rather unfortunate that the restaurant did not order an organic/original ketchup given the quality of the ingredients otherwise, but I guess a minimal amount of HFCS won't kill me.   Having finished off our burgers and laughing more at the PTI analysis of the USC/Oregon State result my buddy and I opted for a dessert burger - the chocolate version featuring a split donut topped with a chocolate gnache puck, mango \"cheese\", and strawberries.  Humorous in presentation and tasty in flavor, this choice was excellent and split down the middle this \"burger\" was just enough after the huge burger/fries.  The mango cheese was especially surprising in its fresh taste and jello-like texture while the chocolate puck was so rich I doubt I'd have finished one myself.  The donut was a tad dry, IMO, but didn't hurt the burger overall.   All told I liked the energy and the food at Burger Bar.  While certainly our most \"low class\" meal, I actually enjoyed the experience and the pricetag more than Sensi and Craftsteak and my buddy loved it which was excellent since he humored me in going to so many French restaurants on the weekend.  IMO, foie and truffles are best served by a chef like Stratta or Savoy and not on a piece of beef and buried under toppings...the concept of the Rossini Burger is ludicrous and anyone ordering it is showing off and missing out on the opportunity for more originality and customization at a lower price.  Regardless, to each his/her own and I think the concept of designer burgers has a lot to offer...even if the underdressed and uncustomizable option at Father's Office is still the standard by which most burgers are judged.",

    "text": "Earlier in the evening, last Friday, I visited Hubert Keller's other place, Fleur de Lys. So after experiencing amazing service and food, we dropped in his casual Burger Bar for a snack.  Well, I wish I had never had gone.***  They have a funny system where you basically pick your choice of meat, an array of toppings, various buns, etc. I decided I didn't have enough brain power to do all that so I ordered the sliders. Everything initially tasted good but as the food cooled and our appetites were satiated, everything started tasting a bit off. I ended up not eating the buns for the sliders and stopped eating the fries. Even the wonderfully fried onion rings were weird.  They did have some burgers that you didn't have to do a thing but order like the foie gras burger ($60) but after explaining to my group what foie gras was, they all decided it was disgusting so I didn't get to order it.  But still, nothing was horrible. It just didn't seem to be worth the price (except for maybe my $15 22 oz Doc's Draft Pear Cider). However, one in our party really didn't like her food so the manager ended up taking 10% off our entire bill. That was very kind of them.  Late night you see a lot of drunks walking to and fro. This seems more like a frat/ sports bar anything with the crowd seemingly made up of 80% guys. I did witness a waitress help a girl in an extremely short skirt to the restroom. She later stumbled back to her table with her skirt hitched almost up to her crotch. Oh wow. Note to drunk girls, Burger Bar is not dark enough to hide bare thighs.  *** We only went because we meant to grab late night happy hour next door but they just closed at 11 p.m.",

Each time I end up getting a wagyu burger with a bunch of elaborate toppings and all three sauces from Keller's other restaurant at Mandalay, Fleur de Lys. It's an epic feast and hits the spot every time.  One notable exception was a couple of years ago when we came an hour before 2 a.m. closing. At that hour, the service was weak and the food seemed cold. Otherwise, they cook it a solid medium rare each time - something that a lot of other hamburger places have trouble with.  Solid hamburgers, with quality ingredients, at strip prices. And if you get lucky you'll see Hubert himself walking around.",

The last time we were at Vegas, we couldn't find this place for some reason but we were adamant this time and found it.  At first, I thought it was just another burger joint as The Counter but Burger Bar is much better in every way. The service was great and the food was sooooo GOOD!  I ordered the Atlantic Salmon burger ($8.50) on a wheat bun and added on spinach and avocado. The burger already comes with red onions, lettuce, tomato, and a pickle as basics. The add-ons cost a little more but for all that, it came to be like 10 something. The salmon was cooked to moist, tender and juicy and everything complimented the flavors very well. Since I am not going back to Vegas anytime soon, I am definitely going to make this at home.  Of course, I can't have a burger without fries! We ordered a side of sweet potato fries and their buttermilk fried zucchinis. The sweet potato fries has the right crispiness without the grease. It could have used a little more seasoning but I was okay with it. On the other hand, the buttermilk zucchinis was seasoned to perfection with a slight crunch and the perfect crispness. (Oh my..I want more now!)  This was a great experience at the Burger bar and it is an A + in my book.",

We always add provolone cheese, cheddar cheese, cinnamon bacon, and oyster mushrooms. All delicious and to die for.   They carry some awesome beers (try the Wailea wheat!), and service has always been good. The wait sucks, but there's a reason wy this place always has a wait.",

Erin never let our glasses get even half way empty. She had about five tables or more and she ran them like a pro! This place is in the shops area between Mandalay bay and Luxor. I would totally recommend this burger place! Thanks again to Erin!!!",

    "text": "So I'm walking through the Mandalay Place after exiting Luxor and pick up a magazine that shows this huge hamburger on it, a story about the best burgers in town.  Sure enough, Burger Bar is at the top of the list. This is Super Bowl Sunday, so right before the game starts, I see that it's not too busy inside and the maitre 'd tells me I can sit at the bar, but anything over an hour may cost me an extra 25 bucks.  No problem, I didn't plan on being there that long.  Had to catch a plane back to Cali.  I pick me out the Salmon Burger.  This thing is awesome; large and very tasty, cooked just right and comes on a variety of buns.  I chose the potato bun.  Great choice.  For what I got, as a single patron, this place was great.  Easy, friendly, great service, stunning waitresses.  I hope to make my way back.",

    "text": "I love this place! I heard about it through a friend who saw it on the Food Network. They were featured because of their $60 Rossini burger, which is a Kobe Beef with sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, and Madiera sauce on an onion bun. *They have the same burger at a restaurant in the Wynn (next to the big waterfall) for $32! My fave is the American Kobe Beef Burger! It's SOOO good! If you're there, you also need to try their sweet potato fries. All the burgers can be customized with toppings of your choice.   If you have room for dessert (which I always do!), you definitely have to try their dessert burgers. I've tried their chocolate burger (the best one), which has the warm donuts as the buns, chocolate ganache as the meat patty, passion fruit as the cheese, strawberry as the tomato, and mint as the lettuce! SOOO good! I have also had their Creamy Cheese Cake burger, which has cheesecake and carmelized pineapple on it.   It is definitely one of the best burger places in Vegas! Btw, it's located in Mandalay Place (the shopping area) of the Mandalay Bay casino. Be prepared for a 30min -1 1/2 hour wait though. It's worth it! You can always walk around the mall or check out the great dessert place next door...  Here is a little script from the Mandalay Bay website on the restaurant:  The ultimate burger experience, from the famous restaurateur Hubert Keller of Fleur de Lys, comes to Mandalay Place. Incorporating the finest varieties of beef, buffalo, turkey, vegetarian and vegan products, a range of gourmet toppings and delicious buns, Burger Bar has a little bit of everything for the creative eater. Complete the experience with a Sweet Burger dessert or a hand-crafted micro brew.  Here is their menu, if you want to check out what they have to offer as well as the prices:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.usmenuguide.com%2Fburgerbarmenu.htm&s=6390ba799293e0acc96d8fdf809caec2fd71f37b1080b239d14357578623bc81\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">usmenuguide.com/burgerba...</a>  YOU HAVE TO EAT THERE!",

Had the Hubert Keller burger (Chef's Favorite) with Ciabatta bread, soft blue cheese, spinach and onions.  It was FANTASTIC.  The blue cheese was perfect, not overwhelming at all.  A perfect blend.  Also tried the fried Pickled Jalapenos - WOW.   Next time I want to share the Rossini burger with someone (Kobe beef, Foi Gras and truffles) - right up my alley!   Great selection of beer as well.",

She also said she was surprised that we didn't order them because she said everyone orders them. I have had them since this experience and I kind of wish I had ordered them. The waitress was sick of them because she ate to many of them as would I.   I showed my husband the dessert burger off this page and he was pissed that he didn't get to order that.

Sometimes the hostesses are a little snotty, but the snotty ones don't last long and the management always makes sure you're happy and full.  The burger selection is fantastic - your choice of buffalo, beef, turkey, chicken, salmon, or lamb (that's relatively new option). Topping choices are extensive as well. There's something for everyone. My favorite is buffalo with a fried egg, bacon, and roasted peppers with no bun. Other times I'll do zucchini, spinach, and roasted pepper. I've had their burgers a dozen ways and they always come out delicious.  Also, they have their sweet potato fries down pat. Love them.  Oh, and do yourself a favor and get a shake after you're done eating. They're huge and filling and will most likely ruin your appetite (do I sound like your mum?).",

    "text": "A friend was staying at Mandalay so we thought it would be the perfect opportunity to try it.  It's located in the second level Shoppes at Mandalay towards the Luxor.    To start we all shared the Jalapeno Onion Petals.  Very tasty! At first I couldn't taste any of the jalapeno kick but after a few bites it showed up.  It's served with BBQ sauce and ranch.  There was a large amount so it was easily split with three people.    For my meal I chose the Burger Bar Sliders.   Three cute little burgers just calling my name.  They are topped with plain bacon, cheese and grilled onions.  I used some of the leftover sauce from our appetizer as well.  Really good! Of course I had to get the sweet potato fries on the side.  They give you plenty with your meal.  I almost didn't finish them... Almost.  I enjoyed every bite.    I also had a taste of my husbands burger.  He built his own with angus, grilled onions, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno bacon.  They cooked this perfectly.  Plus the jalapeno bacon is fricken awesome! Definitely better than the plain bacon on the sliders.    Service here could have been a bit better and more attentive.  Our drinks sat empty for a while until a different waitress came by.  But I did appreciate the others taking our finished plates promptly.    Even though it is pricey for burgers and drinks, i wouldn't hesitate to dine here again.  I think everything nowadays is pricey so I'll just roll with it.",

    "text": "Came here one night with a friend from out of town. He's a burger lover so whenever he's in town, we always try a different burger place. So this time, it's time to try Burger Bar!  Burger Bar is located between Mandalay Bay and Luxor in the shopping strip area by the swarovski store.   We had a party of 4 and we were seated fairly quickly. Then again, it was also like 10 PM at night so it wasn't particularly busy anyways. The establishment itself was pretty big. It had a huge bar on top of that.   I'm not exactly a burger lover so my opinion is pretty neutral. However, what I do believe is that when you're trying out a burger place, you should always go with a classic. With that, you are more able to taste their ingredients clearly. Extra ingredients won't be getting in your taste bud's way.   I ended up with their \"American Classic\" --  black angus beef patty topped with American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun served with a side of skinny fries. I opted to put their crispy bacon on the side. I don't like bacon on my burger because it ruins the texture for me.   While I'm sure that they use good quality ingredients, their seasoning department is quite lacking. Not only was my burger under seasoned, my fries were under salted. Perhaps some people like that? I'm not one of them though. I ended up putting salt on everything like my life depended on it. And before you think that the bacon would've made a difference -- I'm not the only one in my party that thought the patty was under seasoned. Speaking of that crispy bacon, it wasn't crispy at all. It was more soggy than anything. Limp even.   The price was a little bit on the higher end of things, especially for a burger. My American Classic was almost $16. So with tax and tip, you'll probably looking at around $20. Though you do have to factor in that you're on the strip and it's advertised as a gourmet burger. The good part about it is that the burger they give you are decently sized. I got pretty full after eating half of my burger. I actually needed my friend to help me finish my burger :) Needless to say, he was stuffed to the bone afterwards.   Overall, Burger Bar didn't quite capture my taste buds or my attention. It's decent and not a bad place to hang out with friends when you're in the area. AKA when your friends are in town. I personally wouldn't be back to this establishment as .. I think there are better burger places in town.",

    "text": "Located just a couple turns from Luxor in Mandalay Place.  After hearing that Pete Rose was around the corner signing autographs at the sports place, we ventured upon Burger Bar and ordered something to go. Why to go? Why not stop here for a regular meal?  Well one reason is that we were in a rush.  Well then why stop here?  Because, my friends, they have something that is called the Nutella burger. The Nutella burger? What? I've never heard of that! The Nutella burger is on a glazed \"doughnut\" with a nutella mousse, strawberries, and a passion fruit gelatin. And nutella. Lots of nutella. The nutella was as thick as a regular patty. All that for $7. So here's what you'll think. I can get a burger for $7? Yes and no. First off, it's a dessert burger, so naturally it'll be small. Hahaha yeah it was small. I kinda guessed that since it was Vegas and I saw the prices of their other burgers. There's a Kobe burger for a price that I'm not going to repeat on here, but if anyone has ordered it, I wonder if that is good :P (you can check pics if you want :P )  The nutella burger was... interesting. Obviously it was a dessert burger and the donut thankfully, was glazed. The nutella overwhelmed the entire burger and you couldn't really make out the fresh fruit that was on the bottom of the burger. It had decent flavor, was surrounded by the Nutella (which obviously was the star).  Something interesting to try here, but probably one and done, unless someone else comes with me to Vegas and wants to try it out. :D  Friendly service, as the person who was seating at front was knowledgeable, kept us updated with our to go order, and was nice. :D",

We also got the gluten free buns and gluten free steak fries which were both very good.  Decent beer selection too, and they have some interesting malts if you still have room (we didn't).

The food is now sub par.  The kitchen can't get the orders right.  The taste of the food is lackluster and way over priced for the quality. We had to return a hamburger because the meat was bad.  Replaced with grilled chicken which was dry and flavorless.  The shakes are $13 and don't taste all that special.  You can't taste all the different flavors in the specialty shakes.  The cookie dough tasted sour/bad.  The General Manager isn't even aware of the food specials that have been advertised for game days.   We gave it two tries and will never come back.  It's really sad because years ago this was a great restaurant.",

    "text": "We ate here because the Veggie Burger sounded amazing. It had so many yummy things in the patty. However, this was definitely a case of the description sounding betting than the food actually tasted.  First off, there were only 2 vegetarian things on the menu, and the wrap was (I think) $14, so we went with the $10 burger. Unless we wanted to pay $1 or more extra per topping, even for sauces, we opted to just have the lettuce, tomato, and onion it came with, and some ketchup from the table.  Pretty much, the toppings were the only flavor.  The patty itself was incredibly bland, with no discernable seasoning at all. The worst part, though, was the consistency. It was SO mushy, it squished out the sides of the bun when we took a bite. It was like trying to eat mashed potatoes on a bun. We both ended up using our forks to eat them...not even knives, it was that mushy. Such a disappointment, after the menu made is sound so great.  The non-vegetarian food might be better, no idea. A couple good points, they had a pretty large beer selection, and the sweet potato fries were good, though the portion you get for $4 (the burger doesn't come with a side) is really small, and not worth it. Our server, Andres, was nice and attentive, which is appreciated, especially since they were fairly busy.  It was one of the less expensive places we could find for dinner, Vegas is getting ridiculous, so it was fine for that one time. We wouldn't go back though, and at least for vegetarians, we wouldn't recommend it.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I'm not a huge fan of burgers and only came here for my boyfriend who loves them. But I'm trying to be fair and judging based on if I did like burgers lol.  We came here on a Wednesday around noon before Thanksgiving. It wasn't too crowded so we got seated immediately. The waiter was really friendly and promptly took care of us. I got the chef's milkshake (called black & white I think). At first I thought $10.50 for a milkshake was super expensive, but when I got it I understood why - it was super big and had tons of stuff inside - chocolate, cookies (I think), chocolate whipped cream, and tons of both vanilla and chocolate ice cream made of real dairy. Maybe avoid if you're lactose intolerant and share with someone if possible. We almost got the fries sampler which was interesting but decided against it after the large milkshake came. I got the turkey burger with onion buns. Never had onion buns in my life but fell in love - it wasn't pungent and smelled and tasted amazing like cooked onions. The buns were fluffy as well. I felt the turkey patty was \"too high quality\" for me though - felt like I was eating angus beef. I prefer the frozen patties from Costco just because I don't really care for meat and I think those are more flavorful as they probably use more flavoring to mask the lower meat quality, but I'm ok with it! Would probably come back again for happy hour to try their cocktails, wings and sliders, which might be easier for me to eat since I'm not a big burger or meat fan.",

But the top 40 music is at a loud enough level that it feels like I am somewhere fairly awesome but low enough that I don't want to kill myself. The service is top notch. These guys are really on top of things.   This is my first encounter with Hubert Keller (exec chef from Fleur). First impressions are important, and this food didn't let me down. The sliders were cooked to perfection. They were three very basic burgers. The focus was on the quality of the basic ingredients. Keller's staff was putting on a clinic for me of how to present a classic burger with no frills or fancy schmancy sauces and ingredients. I welcome truffles with open arms... In the right dish. You don't need to put them on my burger. I appreciated the sliders for their raw beauty and taste. Of course, if you want truffles, or triple cream Brie, knock yourself out... You can pile on gourmet ingredients all you like.   I was going to get a shake, but at $9 opted to stick to my Diet Pepsi. I think that's where I had the biggest problem. This is definitely a quality burger place. Of the gourmet burger joints in town, this has my vote (for now). However, it is hard for a place like this to dethrone the simplicity and tastiness, and price tag of a good ole single w cheese at In N Out. I know they are not the same. But when I want a burger, INO is the benchmark of a burger. You can certainly get better, but at a $15-$30 premium? $9 for a shake? I'm not sure if that is money well spent.   I'll be back. But not when I am just craving a burger. The next time I get a huge commission and I want to celebrate with my wife or a few of my buddies, the Burger Bar has my name all over it.",

I ordered the lamb burger (medium well) topped with what I remember to be fried egg, mushrooms, caramelized onions, avocado, and a few other things I can't remember on ciabatta.   It was damn massive and having not eaten since 12 pm (it was 9 pm by now), I somehow found the courage to wolf it down in 7 minutes. Perhaps it was my hunger but damn, that was probably one of the best burgers I've had. Everything came together so perfectly and 7 minutes later, I was a happy, well-fed person.   Fries I'm not too crazy on but I stole a few from my girlfriend's plate as she struggled to finish hers and I must say: very good.   Definitely gonna have to come back here soon.

    "text": "Sadly, but most certainly, in the top 3 most tasteless and overly expensive burgers I have eaten in my 55 years on Earth.  $13 for a \"black angus\" burger on a mass-produced ciabatta bun with a slice of lettuce, tomato, onion and a pickle spear.  A small basket (the trendy metal ones that most customers hate) of so-so fries was an extra $4.25?  The burger had zero flavor.  Luckily, we did not have to pay extra for salt, pepper and hot sauce.   That was the only way to eat it.  Ketchup was served in a small cup?  Really - the owners can't spring for ketchup and mustard at each table, but they will give you a \"sticky\" bottle of hot sauce?  Service was too slow for making a simple burger and fries - even for the weekend grillmeister.  The restrooms are outside the restaurant in a hallway used by the shopping mall?  No - I am not joking.  Sodas are $4 each and if the waitresses could learn how to refill them, it still would be a cheap rip-off.  Maybe the higher-star raters had enough alcohol to dull their memories.  In the end, a very expensive meal - $53 for the restaurant's \"classic black angus\" burger, a turkey burger, one order of fries and 2 sodas (never re-filled).  As a local, we will not be coming back, our friends and family will not be coming and for the money we paid, we could have gotten twice the food at Shake Shack and 200% better service.  This place is the typical shopping mall sports bar that does have lots of TVs.   Re-name this place, \"Don't Bother Bar.\"",

The foie gras really tied together that burger.   We has a really great server that helped us as we were first timers.",

Overpriced for quality of food : $35 for a chicken sandwich with Swiss cheese, turkey burger with avocado slices, one side order of sweet potato fries, and one Pepsi . . Turkey burger was very dry and bland. I ordered the homemade Dijon mustard as a side (they charge you for side sauces) and it was not flavorful, not even mildly the nostril opening good stuff of even a store bought brand. The chicken had some flavor to the exterior skin but was also not juicy inside. Very disappointing lunch we chose due to such good reviews. Will definitely not return or recommend.",

I enjoyed the Kobe beef but hate myself for not ordering the lamb burger.  Normally I would rate this establishment a 4 for a reasonable balance between quality, service and price yet we had an experience here where my cousin-in-law accidentally left his wallet and the crew here kept it for him and returned it with every single dollar and card accounted for. Candor experiences like this make for an automatic 5-star review in my book.",

I did not try any of the adult libation as I'd already had quite a few myself..... but what I did see going past me and at the tables looked delicious...and very potent.   A very large selection of hamburgers or at least four to five  hamburgers that can be fully customized with special breads, cheeses. bacons and a myriad of other choices. they truly wicked roster of side dishes as well....... with stand out such as spicy onion petals and everyone's favourite onion rings.  the staff was very busy that night with an unexpected rush of people around 10 o'clock which included a table of 25 or 30. I wanted to sit at that table because there were some very handsome men!  The interior was spotless without being antiseptic. and the Barkers must not be charged grilled because there was no smoke in the main dining area.  If had one suggestion it would be this....  season the meat generously with both salt and coarse black pepper.  I will so be back.",

The one star comes from the despicable host on Thursday afternoon and her sub-par customer service skills. We approached, totally stoked to see them open and we asked to be seated and we were informed that they weren't serving food.   Hmmmm, there was a table that was sat that was having food delivered to them right as we spoke.   WTF is that all about. We were there for a 36 hour mission and this was our main place to go eat, what we had been longing for, was shut down by this person. Learn some better skills and have a better approach. Ended up with a not so impressive meal from a back up plan that we weren't hoping to use.   Thanks for nothing. I hope you're still around the next time I make it down there...",

Were told they are just waiting for a table large enough to fit us. No problem, seated soon after that. The music got a little repetitive, like it sounded as if one song was stuck on repeat. The burger came out cooked exactly like I asked to medium rare. Had foie gras on it and thick cut fries with aioli. Great taste, great bun. A friend at the table got the \"truffle sauce\" and it was more like a broth that they drizzled truffle oil into 5 hours ago. No truffle taste what so ever. Ive had better burgers, but this was one of the few times it actually came out perfectly to the temp ordered by everyone at the table!  The server sighed as we asked him to pay the check with 3 cards as if pressing the button to split on the POS system and having to swipe not one but 3 cards was some painful process. Love to see him when the POS system goes down and he actually has to go old school on the knuckle busters and have to actually write out totals. Sorry to be so difficult.  On the way out we couldnt even get the 3 hostess to look up and acknowledge we were leaving and say good bye or thank you. The bussers dont care about the right of way either twice we were nearly run over as we were walking out and it wasnt like they were doing 700 covers that night. Overall the food was way better then expected but the service needs some serious work and improvement. Would go back again and just sit at the bar.",

Let's start with the drinks - they have an excellent beer selection, including fat tire which is one of my favorites.  Pitcher for $22 = very happy me.  Their burgers were cooked to perfection and included fresh, very tasty ingrediants that matched some of the other upscale burger places I've been - like Five Napkin in Manhatten.  I had the Black Jack Burger, which I can attest was fantastic.  My friends also enjoyed the American Classic, Black Angus Beef and Original Ultimate Burgers.  As far as sides, I tried their sweet potato fries as others on Yelp have said they are fantastic - I thought they were good but nothing special.  If I were to go back and I would probably go with regular fries.  Finally, the atmosphere was great.  Very modern place and it was packed, everyone was having a great time.  Great experience, I would definitely recommend.",

Gotta love it.... wish I was there now...",

    "text": "3-stars.  Average.  Middle of the road.  The taint.  Someone help me understand how there can be so many people - legendary Las Vegas-based Yelpers that I have much respect for - that live in a town that has BLT Burger, StripBurger, Bradley Ogden, Daniel Boulud, Stack... and yet still stamp the holy, golden '5-star' on Burger Bar.  When it comes to burgers, unless it's a $1000 burger served in some back alley by a gorilla, I personally don't really care about the price, venue, wait, or even the service.  If you're gonna give this joint 5-stars, I think you need to be prepared to tell me that this is gonna be the BEST...[grrr]... BURGER... [arrrrgh!]...EVVVVERRRR!! [HULKSMASH]!!!!!   (Oh, and compare it to a known quantity, please.)  1) THE TEST I strolled into Burger Bar the other day (after waving to & observing the flirtatious \"Minus 5 girls\" for a minute - big ups to 'Leo C' for the mention in his review) & bought two burgers:   This \"Rossini Burger\" & this other Angus Beef Burger with grilled onions, avocado, and swiss.  That's right.  Eff it.  I'm on vacation, b-tches.  2) THE TASTE I hunkered down and tried each of these things, disregarding size or accompaniments. -- Rossini:  It was pretty GOOD... but it just wasn't OMGWTFGREAT. The beef was quite tasty and rich but the one thing I expected more of was the robust truffle flavor that I thought would be there and that didn't really come through... I question why they even add it.  And the Foie Gras thing was weird - I suppose I expected something a little more... \"fois gras-like\" and what I got... wasn't.  Did they make my burger, right?  I mean it still tasted good but the texture wasn't what I'd expected.  -- Angus:  Again, not BAD... but just not that GOOD.  The beef wasn't nearly as juicy as the Rossini nor was it as flavorful which is to be expected I guess but to put this into perspective, I think a slightly better burger is purchasable through the Venetian's Room Service.  That's all I'll have to say about that.  3) THE COMPARATIVES Think of this as, \"Two burgers go in; one burger comes out\".  I'm going to dump the Angus burger since I didn't think it was outstanding & nuanced enough to 'compete' and strictly compare the Rossini against some other burgers I've had from memory.  With the exception of Bradley Ogden, you may assume that I expressly order their best beef with avocado and some onions.  -- BRADLEY OGDEN beats Burger Bar -- BLT BURGER beats Burger Bar (this was close) -- BURGER BAR beats Stack (this was even closer) -- BURGER BAR beats StripBurger  CONCLUSION I don't think Burger Bar produces the finest burger in Las Vegas.  It's more like something somewhere in the middle... which of course is fine.  I boxed the Rossini Burger, because... well, I'm not gonna leave behind a frickin' $60+tax+tip burger on a plate for them to dump.  But it's sitting here in my hotel room after having made the taxi ride home and sadly I don't think I'm going to finish it.  Nor do I think I'll go back for another when Red Square's got such tasty casual tapas dishes on the other side of the hotel.    3-stars.  ------------- FUTURE PATRONS OF MINUS 5: I think that it's important that I verify for all gentlemen approaching Minus 5 for beverages, that based on my interaction & careful observation of the youthful Minus 5 marketing staff, that the area in & around the Ice Lounge is definitely \"chilly\".",

My boyfriend and I loved this place so much that we went two nights in a row.  The first night I had a buffalo burger with caramelized onions, avocado and pepperjack cheese on a whole wheat bun.  The burger was cooked perfectly and was juicy and delicious.  The next night, I had a turkey burger with caramelized onions, pesto and mozzarella.  Yet again, the burger was absolutely delicious and cooked perfectly.

I wanted to like this place since Hubert Keller designed the menu. We tried the $16 Kobe burger which should have been moist and delicious, but instead it was a over-cooked, scrawny little hockey puck on a so-so bun. The fries were just OK. I've had better...everywhere else.  My advice:  Save the money and go to Keller's absolutely fabulous Fleur de Lys. Go to the Las Vegas location, not the flagship San Francisco one. I tried both and they don't even come close to each other...so wierd.",

We ordered 2 burgers.... 1 kinda indulgent and 1 kinda plain.  - Angus beef, bleu cheese, carmelized onions, oyster mushrooms, bacon, and a side of black truffle sauce on wheat.  - Angus beef, pepperjack cheese, guacamole, salsa on an onion bun.      We also had thick fries & zucchini.  Everything was delicious.  I was pouring the truffle sauce on every bite even after we put some on the burger.  The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is because of the prices.  It hurts a little to pay more than $50 for a hamburger + french fry lunch.  I'll admit though, it was worth it and I'll definitely be coming back when I'm in Vegas again next month.",

I'm guessing that even with all the different meat choices, the normal taster isn't going to be able to distinguish between the cheaper and medium priced beef. Throw in the fact that no one's going to be going to eat just a normal cheeseburger (who wants to when there are 7 types of cheese, tons of toppings, and even foie gras and truffles to be added), it's just not worth it to go for the more expensive meats.  I'm not a big fan of allowing the guest to create their own dish. It smacks of the chef not having a great menu. Just think of Father's Office in Santa Monica: one burger, no substitutions, no additions and no one complains. Why? We know perfection when we taste it. Burger Bar's concept is too \"of the masses.\" An edited menu would have shown the owner's concept better.  Sliders at the Burger Bar were cute, but instead of showing me three different slider possibilities, why not create the \"perfect\" slider and show me why it's perfect?  So many reviews for this place on yelp, I'm pretty sure my review is going to get lost in the masses.",

It seems like the only times people are not satisfied is when they have a mental block regarding the price because it is a simple (and usually cheap) American standard. For my money, BB is well worth it - and I am not even a burger lover by any means. The ingredients are high quality and the food is usually executed perfectly. The beer selection is great and they throw in just enough wine options. The service is usually decent, but there has been some suspect service for a Strip property (especially considering how easy of a job it is at this joint). The blah decor, and a little inconsistency on the food and more so on the service is what holds BB back from five stars. Tip: All of the meat here is high quality. Skip the more expensive beef options and go with the least expensive. I have tried them all and more expensive options are not worth the extra dough.",

The \"design your own burger\" concept is not new, but they have great options, better than any place I've seen before.  I went with an Angus patty, ciabatta bun, jalapeno bacon, blue cheese crumbles, and caramelized onions.  Perfection, served medium rare.  My wife opted for the buffalo patty on whole wheat and kept it simple with cheddar cheese.  This is not usual for her, but whatever, she enjoyed it.  Sweet potato fries were good, about average for what we've had before.  We both walked away satisfied until an hour or so later at the airport when our dinner made an emergency evacuation.  Both of us.  This is the reason I gave 3 stars instead of 4.  Hopefully just a fluke.",

    "text": "Incredible Burgers!!  I'm not a big burger fan but the burgers here give me major cravings.  During my first visit, I had the turkey burger and it was juicy and super flavorful.  The next visit I tried the angus burger and there is no turning back.  The burger is full of flavor and is very \"tender\" (if that makes sense)...it almost falls apart in my mouth.  The fries and shakes are really good as well.  One note: in cooking their burgers, the chefs err on the side of caution and make them a little better done then at other places.  I always get medium burgers at other restaurants, but here I go with medium rare and it's perfect and pink every time.",

I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good tasty juicy burger lets not forget the fries and beer. =] Although it took 45mins to get a table it was worth the wait.  **Burger Bar right between Mandalay Bay and Luxor**",

    "text": "The Kobe burger was amazing.  Cooked exactly the way I had ordered it.  Caramelized onions...so good.  Sadly the side items we tried, the mozzarella sticks and onion rings were pretty \"meh\" and tasted like bag frozen bar food.  Why establishments will serve amazing food next to mediocre food will forever elude me.  The $15 strawberry mojito was ok, though if it had any liquor in it, sadly the flavor went undetected  The thing that really brings the expirence down for me, was the service.   It initially started out quick and attentive, but like water in the desert, it quickly vanished.  We sat with empty drinks at the end of the table, both liquor and then water, for the better part of 20min without anyone stopping by.  By the time we finally got our ticket, Id forgotten who our server was.  This place could be so much better...but i guess with the throngs of people, theres really no motivation to make a good place great.",

I did love the sugared/salted rim. Yum.  We sat down and I ordered a Killian's and my husband got a Chimay Blue. For lunch, I ordered the Wagyu burger, medium, with aioli, fried egg, and pepper jack. My husband got the Prime Choice burger, MW, with sliced cucumbers, dijon, spicy ketchup, and cheddar.  We also ordered the fried pepper jack shotz, sweet potato fries and fried zucchini.  It took only about 15 minutes to get our food. The zucchini fries were freaking AMAZING. Wow, they were good. The fried cheese was so yummy - nice and spicy and we loved the sweet potato fries too.  I put some aioli on my bun, took a bite and the damn fried egg yolk exploded down the front of my shirt. I'[d ordered the egg  over medium, so that surprised me (and dismayed me too). When I looked at the burger, it was dripping blood and was almost all pink/red, so that was definitely NOT medium. The waitress came over and was very nice about sending it back. She gave me some club soda for my shirt. My husband really enjoyed his burger. Mine came back perfect medium and I pierced the yolk this time. Live and learn. It was super good. Very tender, flavorful and just delicious. I really wish we had one of these in Austin!!  We didn't have any room for a milkshake, but the ones I saw going by looked very yummy.",

    "text": "I don't usually write reviews but this time I just can't miss. It is the second time we have been disappointed. Burger Bar is a great place. Me and my co-workers come in at least once a month. Over the last couple of months this place is going down. I don't see any of the older servers here and the customer service is just sooo...bad.  I am in the industry myself and some things you just can't do.  The reason we come here is for the good burgers and the good selection of beers, but you can not ask your server for a beer advise and be answered \"I'm sorry but I don't drink beer\" This is a beer joint you got to know your beers girl.  So we come in and the first thing is the hostess, we ask for our favorite server, the server who usually serves us, the hostess tells us that the only way we can be served by her is if we have a reservation or we need to wait over an hour. If we don't want to wait an hour we can be seated with Hillda or Hadia ... don't really remember the name in only 20 min. So we agree to wait 20 min and go with the other server. OMG was this a mistake. We wish we waited an hour.   Later we meet the girl who usually serves us and she tells us that actually she was not busy and she actually had had empty tables all along.   So we not only got bad service, but we had to wait extra time for the bad service after we actually requested someone else to serve us.   NOW THIS IS JUST OUTRAGEOUS!   IF I would to do this in my restaurant ... I'd be fired on the spot.  You can't sit guest to your friend's tables, you can't tell me you can not recommend me a beer because you don't drink beer, when I ask for ranch I want it with my food, not after I'm done with it, and you need to check with me when the food arrives to make sure nothing is missing.   The management need to do something about teaching their stuff what is waiting tables about. You can't run Hubert Keller's joint with amateurs.   The chances that we won't come back anymore are very big.   Food is good though...",

Upon checking in with the (very disinterested) hostess, we found out that the wait was going to be at least 30 minutes unless we found a seat at the bar. We scoped out the bar and finally found two handicapped accessible seats at the very back. Hey, I'd sit at the kids table if it meant that I'd get to eat sooner. Luckily, two people at the main bar left and husband was able to snag their seats. No kiddie table for us, yay!  Of course, sitting at the bar meant that the service was a little slow, but it wasn't horrible. The bartender was friendly, so that goes a long way.  The food definitely made up for it.  We got an appetizer of the jalepeno beer-battered fried pickles, which stayed piping hot all the way to the last bite. Husband got the surf and turf burger and fries ($24) while I made my own: American \"Kobe\", medium-well, oyster mushrooms, monterey-jack cheese, and bacon. Side of sweet-potato fries ($22). I don't know if it was a $22 burger- I could have done without the bacon, but it was fantastic. DH couldn't keep his hands off my sweet potato fries, either.  We were too full for shakes or desserts, but enjoyed our experience there and can check it off our list of burger joints!",

This time, I ordered the NatureSource USDA Burger, cooked medium, on a plain bun with cheddar and pepperjack, jalapeno bacon, avocado, roasted peppers and chipotle aioli and a side of skinny fries with truffle mayo to dip.  The burger was thick, juicy and flavourful and I was surprised that the jalapeno bacon shone through in a delightful way.  The truffle mayo may have almost upstaged the burger.  It's so good I could drink buckets of it! A must try and delicious with fries. Great beer selection and our server was equally great and made a quick recovery when missing one order of fries. One out of the four of us had the Salmon burger and said it was mediocre but the other two who had beef burgers were incredibly impressed.",

Went two days in a row, Kobe burger one day, the regular (angus?) the next...  Actually found the Angus to be more flavorful, but they were both incredible.  Fries (reg and sweet potato) are fantastic.  Milkshakes are also actually worth the $9 or whatever they cost (and I'm not a person that's particularly keen on sweets).  If you're in town and you like burgers, you shouldn't miss this place.",

    "text": "After hearing about the Burger Bar for the last two years I finally got a chance to try it and the gourmet burgers are very good. I went with a business associate and we both ordered the Kobe Beef burger which, according to the menu, is produced in the Snake River area. Our burgers were cooked perfectly and were tasty. I ordered the buttermilk onion rings and they were excellent. Maybe the best onion rings I have ever eaten!  Burger Bar offers a huge selection of condiments to pile on your burger but every item will add a buck or two the the cost of the meal. The Kobe Burger will run $20 so be prepared.  Service was very good and the iced tea and lemonade are both perfectly prepared. The restaurant reminds me of a loud sports bar and there is loud music playing over the speaker system.  It is very difficult to hear and carry on a conversation.  It is a good choice for quick meal, once you are seated, and a tasty burger.",

Went back for lunch this past weekend with some guys for a friend's bachelor party and this time had the Country Natural with bacon, blue cheese, and chipotle aioli on ciabatta.  It was a really good burger, and the ciabatta is a nice touch, but it loses two stars for two reasons:  1) If I'm \"designing\" it myself, where is the added value of having Hubert Keller associated with the place?  It's really just some guy in the back who cooks the ingredients that I've chosen for him.  2) Again, it costs more than Father's Office in LA, which is my favorite burger.  You have to make a better burger to charge more for it - nuff said.",

Granted, I have never actually met the French chef but I feel like after watching Top Chef Masters, I am convinced that he is a wonderful person who makes mouth-watering food. Fiance and I went here while watching my cousin's 16month old baby. It was a fantastic night. First, it was exactly what we were looking for - delicious food in a casual setting so that baby Cami could make all the noise he wanted and no one would mind. I had their sliders (three kinds - buffalo, kobe and classic mini-burgers) with sweet potato fries - yummm! Fiance built his own burger - kobe beef, grilled onions, cheddar cheese on focaccia with deep-fried zucchini spears. Delicious! Fiance has declared that it was the best burger he'd ever had. I must admit that I thought the zucchini spears were even better than my sweet potato fries. We ended it all with one of their decadent milkshakes - the caramel latte. oh man, it was a bit too sweet for me but fiance drank it down in seconds.   there are lots of other things we definitely want to come back and try  (BUT only when we really are feeling the big-spending Vegas mood), especially their luxurious $60 burger that comes with kobe, foie gras AND black truffles. ridiculous!",

At first I thought that it was gonna be just another overpriced burger joint.  I was wrong though... I have visited this place every time I have been to Vegas since that trip almost 2 years ago.  I am absolutely in love with the turkey burger as the patty is juicy and incredibly delicious.  The portion is generous and they offer an array of toppings you can put on your burger.  I usually stick to the pepper jack, grilled onions, and bacon (if I really feel like treating myself).  I recommend also ordering a helping of sweet potato fries or zucchini fries.

For dinner, he did a make-your-own burger with a lamb patty that was really juicy and delicious, and I got the baguette burger which was also really good.  The meat oozed delicious, umami juicy goodness all into the crunchy yet perfectly chewy baguette.  The only thing I would do is add a tad more cheese.  The fries (regular and sweet potato) were both stellar, especially with the spicy ketchup.  I was a little afraid it would just be some tabasco-splashed ketchup, but this stuff is super good, and you can tell it's made from scratch with little bits of peppers in it.  The service was just meh... it was pretty much the equivalent of ordering on a touch-screen which might have actually been a little more fun.  The hostess, however, was very sweet and talked to us more in 5 minutes than our server did the entire time.  For 2 burgers with fries and 2 waters it was $45, so it is definitely your typical overpriced strip restaurant, albeit with damn good burgers.",

(Turkey, Beef, Salmon, Buffalo, etc.) Lots of different toppings to choose from (from sprouts to lobster to truffles). An extensive BEER and WINE list. They have beers from micro breweries around the country.  Everything was fresh.  Cons: The food was pretty bland.  The service was sub-par.  I was in a party of 6 and they included gratuity. The places was LOUD. The seating was cramped. The hostesses were really rude. Everything was overpriced (to be expected on the Strip).  Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place. It is a trek to get to just eat. I was there on a busy Saturday night. We had to wait for everyone to get there before we were seated. The hostess was really rude about all of this too.   We were seated in a booth that comfortably sat 6 people. Our waitress looked like she was juggling about  5 tables, one of which had about 20 people. She could really use a hand.  I ordered a veggie burger, which was quite bland and really need some spice and seasoning. I added grilled onions and guacamole and opted for a whole wheat bun. I ordered a side salad, which was $2.55 for some field greens and a balsamic vinaigrette. A bunch of my friends ordered the sweet potato fries, which are yummy, but they were't any better or any worse than I've had before. Again, nothing spectacular.  In all honesty, I would have been much happier with a Double-Double from IN-N-OUT.   Burger Bar has a good idea, but it really just felt like a dressed up \"Fudruckers\" in an Applebee's setting.",

Great selection of beers, ciders and whatnot.  Got a pear cider that was exceptional and came in a huge ass bottle. I think it was made in NYC. Our bartender was great too, very friendly and down-to-earth.  Price was great for the quality of food, drink and service!!",

I guess that is why I am drawn to Chef's from SF. I have been eyeing this place after seeing a piece on the travel channel. Nestled between a bunch of chic stores, art galleries and bars.   I dug it.   I was totally pleased with the menu setup  4 basic burger types with all the sides sold separately on the side-  milkshake & beer lists as well were very, very detailed. :) Great touch.  The surroundings were causal but people seemed touristy and business suit types. I would see this gem as a great place to get around midnight after one too many cocktails or after a day at Moorea Beach (the adult pool)  I ordered the Buffalo burger with caramelized onions, bacon, & Swiss cheese. The zucchini fries and the skinny fries, They are a separate charge from the burger.    Tried the 5 beer sampler and a wheat hoegarden, left a little tipsy and the perfect amount of fullness. Job well done Burger Bar!",

    "text": "Continuing my Tour de Burgers, I went to Burger Bar twice in two days.  This, however, was not the record among me and my friends.  Two of my friends, went 4 times in 4 days - one had the chicken sandwich, turkey burger, angus burger and a dessert burger and another had a Kobe burger, two angus burgers and a dessert burger.  All bow down to Uvan and Steve!  Well, as far as my experience goes, I will have to say Burger Bar has really good quality burgers.  I had the Kobe burger, rare, no toppings on the plain bun and the angus burger, med. rare, no toppings on the plain bun.  Each time, the burger was cooked exactly as ordered (cool and red in the middle for rare, pink throughout for med. rare).  The bun was exceptional.  It was slightly crunchy but soft and was perfect to absorb the meat juices (which there were plenty).  The size of the patty was perfect as well - not too small, not too big, abouth an inch tall - I'd say it was around 7 oz.  Although I don't notice this at most places, I will say, each burger could have used more salt.  I don't think the meat is pre-salted before it's ground and very little appears to be put on before it's cooked.  But, just a sprinkle of salt really helped the flavor.    Lots of people rave about the Kobe, but I wasn't too thrilled.  For one, the texture was too soft.  (I know, I got it rare, it's supposed to be soft.  Well, that's True.)  But the texture of the meat was soft.  Also, the angus beef had a much more \"beefy\" flavor than expected.  For the price, I'm getting the angus burger from now on.    The sides?  Well, the zucchini fries are great.  Whether they're frozen or not, I don't care.  They are good.  The onion rings are thick with a heavy coating and good.  The fries are fine.  The beer list is very good with well over 20 selections.    TVs for each booth - reason to linger and drink.  Oh, and no corkage fee but terrible wine glasses.  Service is spotty, but really dependent on who's your waiter/waitress.  Overall - one really great place to grab a great burger and some drinks.    Wine I brought and had with the Kobe beef burger: 2003 Miura Garys' Vineyard.  Deep purple color, smooth rich texture, firm acidity, bright plum flavor with leather and earth.  Much more rustic than the Pisoni Vineyard bottling I've had from Miura.  Tasted better after 6 hours, likely because of bottle shock on the drive up.  Much more smooth, less leather and earth and more bright, sweeter plum and fruit notes.",

    "text": "I'm a lover of Top Chef Masters and Top Chef in general, so when I saw that Hubert Keller had a menu favorite burger, I had to take a shot.  Spinach and blue cheese on a burger, I mean, could he really marry these ingredients on top a buffalo burger?  First off, let me preface this by saying that perhaps my palate isn't refined enough to appreciate this particular marriage of ingredients.  With that said, I thought the blue cheese was overpowering and the spinach gave the burger an unusually mushy texture to what was an slightly adventurous attempt at a traditional American flavor.  So, onto something more positive.  The buffalo meat was red and flavorful, when the taste of blue cheese wasn't overpowering.  Also, I had a piece of my friend's Kobe Beef Burger which was the complete opposite as far as ingredients, clean, simple and flavorful.  All in all, I think HK's burger was just a bit too complicated and may have worked for some, just not me.  Everyone else seemed thoroughly satiated with their meals, a Hawaiian burger and Kobe, so would I recommend coming back? Perhaps. $20 a burger is a pretty steep price, but nothing a trip to the craps table couldn't fix.  Btw, if you're thinking about getting that $500 burger+champagne at the fleur de lys in SF, a note from our waitress: try out the $60 at the Burger Bar which is basically the same thing, just w/o that champagne pairing.  Au Revoir!",

Don't get me wrong, I LOVE foie gras, I LOVE kobe beef, and I LOVE truffles....but quoting from a friend of mine, \"you can combine platinum, silver, and gold together and it'd probably end up looking like shit.\"  That basically describes the $80 burger here.

    "text": "$100+ for four guys to each get a burger.  All weekend long we planned to get the Daniel Boulud kobe/short rib/truffle burger but we were running out of time and so we settled on the Burger Bar instead.  The thing about this place is that even though there are endless ways of customizing your burger (choice of meat / bun / toppings / cheese / sauces), most of the time you just want to choose from a combination of toppings. There are a few combinations but none of them sound very good except for a kobe/truffle burger and a burger with lobster in it. I chose to go custom: ridgefield beef, bleu cheese, bacon, and a black truffle sauce on ciabatta with a side of sweet potato fries. My verdict? Pretty awesome. Total damage? 30something dollars. Not too bad, the price of a buffet and either way I'm stuffed.  The other cool thing about this place is it has a very extensive list of beers. They had hitachino beer here but sadly only the lacto and hef here. I don't recommend any of those.   The thing that sucks is it is a small place, it gets busy, and theres no place to sit and wait. There's shopping but you know Vegas and seating... only at the tables or in front of the slot machines. It's in a mall. They need beepers so you can venture away without worrying about losing your spot.  3 stars for it was good and I might come here again.",

    "text": "Great place!  Perhaps the best burger I have ever eaten (more on that in a minute).  First select your burger - regular beef, black angus, maybe splurge on the kobe? Is salmon, turkey,or a veggie burger sounding more like it? And what would you like on top?  Fois gras, a fried edd, lobster, or maybe just American cheese? Actually, pretty much anything you would like on your burger is available. And it's good! And the beer selection isn't bad either.  The place has sort of a sports bar feel to it.  Casual, maybe a little loud, good energy.  I arrived about 10:30 on a Saturday night and the wait was like 10 min.  OK - the best burger ever - the $60 one with kobe beef, fois gras, black truffles, and wine sauce. So good.  Totally worth it.  You must try it at least once in your life.  Wash it down with a Sin City Amber...",

    "text": "YES! Yes, it is all it is hyped up to be! Your burger comes with a side of lettuce, tomato, onion & pickle then you choose your type of meat, bread, cheese, vegetables, sauces, EVERYTHING IMAGINABLE! (All extra toppings cost extra).  They also have an amazing beer selection and great alcoholic & non-alcoholic shakes! Also, each booth has a small tv screen on the side-wall channeling a sports game.  My boyfriend and I began coming here about 5 years ago and we return on every single Vegas trip we take (twice a year). We stayed at the Luxor 5 years ago & this is right at the Mandalay Place coming out of Luxor. We haven't stayed at Mandalay or Luxor since, but wherever we are staying, we make sure to stop by.  Our first experience was superb! I had the Turkey burger on wheat bread with grilled asparagus, portabello mushrooms, and provolone cheese. Then I chose the skinny fries and OMG YUMMY-NESS! My boyfriend gets beef burgers and they are just as delicious!   Let me give you a run-down of all the toppings I remember: Bread- White, wheat Meats - Kobe beef, angus beef, chicken breast, turkey, veggie burger Cheese- Cheddar, provolone, american, jack, blue Veggies- Asparagus, spinach, button mushrooms, portabello,  Surf toppings- Lobster, shrimp Misc.- Fried egg, truffles (expensive!) Sauces- Fleur de Lys chef sauces  Sides- skinny fries, fat fries, fried zucchini, sweet potato fries, onion rings  I've tried many different combinations and they have all been good!  Will keep coming back forever and ever and ever :-)",

It tasted exactly like my wife's regular burger which was mediocre at best.  The place was very expensive which would be ok if the food was exceptional.... It's not!    I dropped $20 on a burger and fries that were bland.  If I wanted a plain old unremarkable burger I could've saved $14 and went to Red Robin.",

It's surprisingly easy...  1) Unresponsive absent servers who forget your order, ignore your table, fail to properly input your order, forget to place your drink order, and forget to place your dessert order....oh and this all happened in one vist.   2) Over fry your Onion Rings what were heavenly delights of fried onion goodness on my last visit were over fried disasters on this one. I doubt my server had the wherewithal to observe this and since we were already behind due to the poor service we didn't bother to send them back.   3) Undercook and present the burger as a pile of meat bread and toppings thrown on a plate. My last visit the attention to detail and execution of the delivery was flawless this time around it was a mess. I have had burgers at 5 guys with more care and attention paid to the preparation.    In one service the place that had the best burger I ever ate and made me a believer ruined my evening and disappointed me at unprecedented levels.   On the upside the server comped my shake and apologized for all the mix ups but I was still really disappointed in my return to burger bar.",

    "text": "Best burger I've had in Vegas (out of five). I went here after my working brother arrived from ORD. I knew it would be late on a Friday for dinner, but there was no wait for a table for two. Destiny, deliciousness, and decadence awaiting us at Burger Bar.  This is a Hubert Keller place!!!! So great. I wish I could tell you who he is!. I bet he has an accent and grew up on the streets of Europe post WWII. That's where he learned the in and outs of food. I have a great imagination, don't I?  Anyway, the menu is STACKED with burger options: Angus beef, buffalo (which my brother ordered and said it was gamey), and USDA beef. They also had Kobe Beef! You know anytime a cow gets a massage and drinks beer to relax in Japan, you know it's gonna be excellent.  I was so hungry and overwhelmed by all the burger topping options. Luckily my brother got onions and since I ordered first and he wasn't ready, I was able to add them after the fact. I ordered the Kobe Beef Burger on whole wheat, with cucumbers, grilled onions, and portobello mushrooms. The meat/bun ratio was GREAT!!!!! I had a choice of fries (sweet potato, skinny, fat, buttermilk zucchini), but I went with the onion rings and was not disappointed. I also got jalapenos (which ruined the burger so I ate one by one). I wasn't mad when my brother let me have some of his sweet potatoes. Well worth the 11 PM wait since my brother had gotten in an hour earlier!!!  We ended up ordering two of their reasonably sized ice cream sundaes. I thought it'd be bigger. I got strawberry he got vanilla and we added coconut (me) and he got a Twinkie, butterscotch, and coconut.  Go if you're in Vegas. $70 total, not including tip. BUT AS KT PERRY SAID! THAT'S WHAT YOU GET WHEN YOU'RE IN VEGAS!",

When we sat down to eat, I liked that the waitress was friendly and easy to talk to.  I also liked that they had a small TV embedded into our booth so that we could watch baseball while dining.    For my entree, I ordered the Surf and Turf burger, which consisted of an angus beef patty with three jumbo shrimp (although the menu online says it has lobster, but it was actually shrimp when I ate here) and asparagus on top.  It was good, and tasted like they used quality ingredients.  However, it didn't mesh as well as I would have liked.  To complement my burger I substituted a side of onion rings instead of fries, and thought they were pretty good.    I can't say that I would go out of my way to eat at Burger Bar, but I would definitely eat here again if I am in the area and can find it.  I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.",

I ordered a burger with spinach, Brie, onion and aioli on a pretzel bun. The burger itself  was good (nothing spectacular) . The bun was yummy and fresh, but there were some flaws with the toppings. The Brie was mostly rind, very little creamy Brie goodness. The spinach was steamed, which I thought was super odd since it was listed in the same group as lettuce. I asked for fresh spinach and the waitress said she didn't know if they had any because they usually cook it all in the morning. Wait, so the spinach on my burger that I ordered at 3:30 was cooked early this morning? The waitress ended up bringing out fresh spinach so that was good.   We also had a wedge salad. Nothing special and actually mediocre at best. One little piece of bacon, minimal blue cheese and the dressing was runny.   I have no problem spending money on an awesome burger, but I do have a problem spending $20 on a nothing special burger that I feel like I could have made just as good (if not better at home).",

I'm so sorry if I spelled that wrong. She was amazing. Although it was busy she greeted us warmly and made sure we were comfortable. I told her it was my girlfriend's birthday and she greeted her right away. She took our orders and our food came out quickly. I spoke to the gentleman that brought out our food and our excessive amount of ranch dressing that we asked for and found out he was the manager. His name was Sam. I thanked him so much for bringing out our food and told him that it shows that he's got great leadership skills to come out and help when it's busy. Which is few and far between. Sam was personable and just a big sweetheart. I believe a True leader leads by example, and from what I saw, that's what he strives to be..... I can't forget about the food! It was delicious!!!! Oh my goodness! And the shakes!!!! Oh and the lady that brought out the shakes was one of our favorite people! My girlfriend had the French kiss and I had the Nutella shake. Both were heavenly.  So thank you Burger Bar for making sure my girlfriend's birthday dinner was a success. You all are amazing.",

    "text": "Such good burgers.  The other reviewers do not lie.  Don't let the prices on the menu - especially the nickel-and-diming for additional condiments - fool you.  You may pay $20 or more for your burger, but you're getting a burger that's worth more than that.  Your Inner Deliciousness Accountant will balance the books and nod approvingly.  As if being a quality burger joint weren't enough, they have a surprising selection of craft beers available.  I was not expecting to find Dogfish Head IPA on the menu three time zones out of Delaware.  I went with the Fat Tire Ale, though - highly recommended.  I liked it so much, in fact, I drank six more the next evening, BUT THAT'S A STORY FOR ANOTHER TIME.  And in case I haven't made it clear: yes, the $16.00 Kobe Beef burger is worth it.  Protip: tourists, this is a bit of a walk.  Once you get in the front door of Mandalay Bay, you still have to walk through the casino to its attached shopping mall, Mandalay Place, and circle halfway around.  Do not let the Urban Outfitters and LUSH outlets fool you - this is not a mall diner.  This is the velvet rope of burgers.",

I love all the choices and have yet to have a burger that I didn't love.  I am also a fan of the boozy milkshakes.    On my last visit I decided to shake things up a bit and order cheese sticks instead of my normal fried zucchini and was slightly disappointed.  They were no better than TGI Fridays or Red Robin.  Next time I will just stick to the zucchini.    It's a bit of a pricey meal, but I figure that's the price you pay for eating on the Strip.",

    "text": "Took the $10 cab ride down to Mandalay to stick some of Hubert Keller's red meat in my mouth.  The wifey and I stumbled onto this place about two years ago, before everyone knew who Hubert Keller was, before Top Chef, before it turned into a herpes-ridden-french whore. And I'm not talking about the waitresses.  Time for a second visit... I say yes...  Walked into the Mandalay... If you've screwed a shark in the face, you've gone too far.   Once we actually found the place again, we walked right in for a late 10pm Vegas dinner.  Drinks?  Tons of beer to tantalize, but I was already three Jameson's in, so let's stick to it.  So I ordered another one.  Waitress brings it and I thought it was Vodka.  This shit was so watered down it was a joke.  If I was just there for drinks I would of donkey-punched the shit out of the bar tender and wrote \"Suck it Vegas\" on his forehead....   But, I didn't.  I don't fuck with people who can fuck with my food.  And since we didn't order yet, I didn't want to get my burger finger fucked by a pissed-off bar tender.  Meaning, this restaurant isn't nice enough to send shit back.  Some places, you just have that gut-feeling that someone will Ryan Reynolds the shit out of your food.   So, I sipped my water with a splash of Jameson, and got down to business.  The wifey ordered the American Classic.  It was good. Not mind-blowing, just good. The regular fries were tasty.  Especially dipped in mayo.  You know what they say, \"When in France.\"  I got the Angus beef, fried egg, bacon, cheddar cheese.  My creation.  They should call it the Heart Attack Breakfast Burger. Yup.  It was fucking good.  Well worth the trip. Then again, if you put bacon and a fried egg on a donkey dick, I would eat that too.  Overall, I would go back... I would just order a beer with my burger.",

Loved taking my vegetarian girlfriend to a burger bar and ordering it rare. Mine was rare and very very delicious. I had it on Sunday on my way out of town so that means i had completely punished myself by the pool and in the lounges the days earlier. That burger said goodbye in a way i needed. It said \"there will be several accidents on the 15 south so this should hold you over for 5+ hours\" and it did. Loved it. I had the skinny fries and they didn't do a thing for me, however the onion rings were pretty damn good. Next time I will go for onion rings.   Staff is really helpful and very attentive. We waited a little bit for the burgers but it was Sunday and Check out time. I'm not the only genius that decided to eat before leaving town so I get the wait.  There were a lot of really good waitress's and that was causing some serious issues with the girlfriend because i was actually looking around at what everyone was eating and my girl friend at first thought I was checkin out the servers.  Then when i explained that i was seeing what everyone else was eating she started laughing and said, of course you are...you yelp more than you look at porn on the internet.  NOW THATS FUNNY.",

    "text": "Not gonna lie, was a little underwhelmed by Burger Bar.  When a restaurant has the name Hubert Keller attached, you expect a certain level of quality, and so I was a little disappointed when what I got was just another burger joint.  That being said, I didn't get one of the signature burgers, so maybe I just didn't order the right thing.  Ordered the Country National sustainable beef burger and topped it with avocado, grilled onions, and jalapenos.  While the meat was flavorful and cooked properly, the sesame seed bun was slightly hard on the outside and a little dry.  The jalapenos were the pickled, sliced varietal you're given to put on your nachos at movie theaters.  We also had a trio of sides - french fries, sweet potato fries, and onion rings - none of which were any better than what you can get at your local neighborhood diner.  If I were to return, would probably be a little more adventurous and try one of the \"Chefs Burgers.\"",

Ohhmmyyyggoooddd. Soooo goooood!  They also have good drinks. I had a long island which wasn't dissapointing but there are a bunch of different types of beers and a full bar.  There was abouy a 20 minute wait around 5pm which really wasn't that bad.  The waiter was friendly enough he wasn't over the top spectacular.

He sent his only begotten Surf & Turf burger to save me in my time of hungover need.  This place is wonderful! From the casual, sportsbar feel (TV's in every booth) to the excellent beer selection, I was impressed. This place would make Tim \" the toolman\" Taylor bark with manly excitement!  Where do I start? Oh yeah...we started with fried jalepeno-flavored pickle spears and zucchini. Both were great! I was especially happy to be washing it down with SD's very own Stone IPA, a local treat.  So, I was there with my gf and we decided to pick a couple burgers and share. That didn't work out very well for her I might add. Given it was my birthday week in Vegas I decided to splurge on the Surf & Turf burger. Yea I said it!  The perfect amount of lobster atop a prime black angus burger that rested on a healthy amount of asparagus, along with a side of mushroom sauce. Ya only live once right? This bad boy left me speechless. The fries were thin and crispy but this burger was an extreme delight.   After biting into the S & T burger, I didn't think it could possible get much better. I should have known...the American Kobe Beef burger here is easily the BEST burger I have ever had in my existence. Period. Sorry Rocky, it's True.  You can get it however you want and add from 30 or 40 toppings. I felt like since I was a first-timer here that I wanted to make this burger work for me. I went easy on it and just added carmelized onions and some cheddah. Ya know how the middle of the burger is always the best, juiciest bite? This entire Kobe burger was the middle of the burger all the way around...in other words, orgazmic!  The service was excellent, very friendly and attentive. They seemed moderately busy but we were seated after maybe a 5 minute wait. I will never go to Vegas again without eating a Kobe burger from here. This succulent treat is KING in Vegas and will have you singin' love me tender at first bite. Long live the king!",

    "text": "Can be tricky to find if you don't know Vegas really well, since it's in the walkway *between* Mandalay Bay and the Luxor. It's worth it. Follow your nose to the Lush bath products store across the hall.  On its face, it seems pretty straightforward: decent bar, burger joint, TVs in the booths showing some sport or other. It goes deeper. Start with the beer list - great selection, large draft list and truly wonderful bottle list. I've had award winning Canadian beers here that I can't even get in Canada. If you've never had a Unibroue beer from Quebec, I recommend the Unibroue 17.  The menu, too, goes deeper. Not just burgers. Grain fed or naturally raised beef? Wagyu, maybe? You are spoiled for choice, but if that intimidates, they have several reasonable pre-defined burgers to choose from or riff on.  I'm the guy who brought Melissa Y. (below) here on her birthday, making lots of noise about the $60 burger. Kobe beef, foie gras, 1/3oz of shaved black truffle on an onion roll. The Rossini, they call it. We each had one, and they were great. Better than great - putting black truffle on a burger is something I haven't done before or since (except on return trips here) and it is some inspired eats, my friend. You would not do badly to spend some blackjack winnings on that little masterpiece.  BUT. I'm going to tell you something important here, so listen good: you can do better. You can make a thing more pure and more perfect. You can reach the Platonic ideal of burger in this place, and reaching Platonic ideals isn't a thing we get to do very often in our lives. Are you ready? Then let's begin.  Ditch the foie - it adds richness where none is required, and the richness it adds is lost in the strong flavours. Ditch the kobe, too. Kobe is either getting you beautiful texture (not irrelevant in ground meat, but certainly *less* so than with steak cuts) or beautiful flavour, but the naturally raised beef has that in spades. Ditch the onion bun as well, if you want my opinion. I like onions plenty, but baked into a roll they lose some of their fire and even if the result is still tasty, you're missing the opportunity to go for their Ciabatta (great texture, nice yeasty flavour, works with the beer) or their Sesame (a classic, done well).  Okay, so now: Keep the black truffles (KEEP THE BLACK TRUFFLES), but maybe get your cheese on, and add some pepper bacon or a fried egg. Congratulations, champ, you've got yourself a burger that adds no pretense, that gilds no lilies, but which explodes with flavour you didn't think a burger could have. This is it, this is the burger you've been waiting for.  I'm proud of you, soldier.",

I had the peppercorn burger and it was good. I like pepercorns and the cracked pepper flavor. Very unique tasting sauce. Chipotle aioli was just ok. Milkshakes are very expensive, I think it was $8.50 and up. I had the Nutella milkshake and it was awesome. Next time I want to try the $60.00 burger (kobe, foix grois,mushrooms and truffles). It looks really good. I am not sure if it is worth it. Oh yeah...add a fried egg to your burger if you can...it adds flavor. Sweet potato fries!!!!! Enough said!  Service -   Aside from the stuck up bitches at the hostess stand. Especially the one with a tattoo on her arm. Service was prompt and friendly.  Our waitress was very nice and helpful.

I'm docking a star because during my last visit the fries were kind of stale. Also, there was inconsistency in the cooks of the burgers. Hubby and I both ordered medium. Our hostess was very clear in telling us it would have a lot of pink, but oddly, hubby's burger had way more pink than mine. If anything, mine was a perfect medium and his more toward medium rare.   With those couple of things aside, I really like Burger Bar. If I'm on the Strip and craving a burger, this would be my first choice.",

I ordered the wedge salad didn't receive a wedge of salad instead it looked like a slice of iceberg. It tasted decent in a fast food kind of experience.  The booze was fine on a positive note! Service was polite but not more than that and cost wise, well your in Vegas.",

Food: I mean, they're nothing really notable about it. You. Can make your own burger or you can choose the chef's special. Now, my take away from this was their extraordinary options for vegetarian/healthy food. I guess that's a nice touch.   I got the turkey burger while my girlfriend got the hangover burger. The turkey was clean but basic for the price. At $11.50, I'm expecting something that could bring a \"wow\" factor. So to be served burger with veges on the side feels a tad bit elementary. While the burger was pretty big, I didn't think it was seasoned well. You basically had to rely on ketchup to heighten the entree. That meal also didn't come with a side so it was a bit disappointing.  The hangover burger tasted pretty good but just like the turkey burger, there was nothing notable about it. They had a side of \"special sauce\" which couldn't live up to its name. This meal came with fries what looks so soggy, it made a bad representation of what fries are. It's embarrassing.   Overall, I don't think I would come back here. It was a good try but very basic.",

    "text": "We LOVE a good burger - this place does not disappoint.  Choose because it was convenient to the Bodies exhibit at the Luxor, and maybe because it had burgers and loads of beer options. Anyway, we weren't really sure what we were getting into. Glad we lucked out with this random choice.  You choose your burger type - beef, Kobe, buffalo, veggie, turkey and I want to say something else... chicken maybe? Then you choose a type of bun - plain, pretzel, ciabotta, and a couple of others. Then topping - there are different greens, cheeses, mushrooms, proteins, uh... Lots of options.  My hubby ordered the Buffalo burger and I ordered a regular beef one. He just got cheese, lettuce and tomato. I got cheese, lettuce, tomato, and a fried egg. We both like.our burgers medium well. Both burgers were cooked PERFECTLY! We both thoroughly enjoyed our burgers.  Fries - lots of types of fries. I got the skinny fries (which doesn't mean low cal, rather the fry size). They were darned tasty!  The hubs got a Smore Shake, which was darned good. I opted for a beer for my calories - it doesn't matter want you like, they'll have a beer for your taste.  Our waitress was fantastic. She was attentive but not in-your-face. Because we were 6 friends enjoying our time together, catching up on BS and relationships and politics.  My only complaint for the evening is that they don't have large tables, rather a bunch of 4-top tables that they put together to make a 6 or 8 seater or whatever. Because we were 6 we had to wait some time for two tables beside each other to open up. Not their fault, it's just that one of the tables was being slow and enjoying each other's company.  I highly suggest you give this spot a try!",

I couldn't make up my mind, so I went with the Burger Bar Sliders. (You can also make your own burger, but I didn't want to think!) They provide 3 different sliders. Perfect. Buffalo w/caramelized onion, Angus w/Bacon and Beef w/American Cheese. You can substitute your side fries and I went with Zucchini Fries. Of the sliders, I preferred the traditional Beef w/Am Cheese and Angus w/Bacon. The Zucchini Fries were good, too.  Good burgers and we were all satiated.",

    "text": "I can't believe I've never reviewed Burger Bar because it is my very favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. I've been dining here for years and while the menu has seen its share of changes (I nearly cried the day they removed the cinnamon bacon from the toppings menu), the food has remained high quality and consistent.   Hubert Keller is one of my favorite celebrity chefs and I've seen him in the kitchen here at least a dozen times over the years. It's always a thrill when he walks through the dining room. Make sure you take a peek into the kitchen in case he's there the day you are in! Many local Vegas celebrities (Penn Jillette, Rick Moonen) also love this place, so keep your eyes peeled for a star encounter.  The wait time here is always long, so arrive at least half an hour before you want to dine. You can check in with the hostess desk and then shop around the mall until your table is ready. Be prepared for an even longer wait if you go at popular times or if you want to be seated in one of the very coveted booths (complete with their own mini television sets).   The menu is simple and totally customizeable. You pick your meat, bread (they do low carb lettuce wraps too), cheese and then as many gourmet toppings as you want. The beef is super high quality and the toppings are delicious. I usually pile my burger high with grilled red peppers, carmelized onions, spicy bacon (extra crispy!), spinach, and grilled zucchini. The end result can get pricey (expect $20 per person, minimum), as you also have to add on a salad or fries or sauces. If you only try one sauce, make it the house made ketchup or the house made mustard. Both are incredibly delicious.  As sides, you can get a decent side salad, soft yet crispy sweet potato fries, regular french fries, or fried zucchini (which is fun to share as an appetizer). There's also a creative menu of milkshakes where you choose the ice cream and ingredients!   The service has always been fantastic, a testament to the high quality standards for the wait staff here. It also appears that there's little turnover, as we've had the same waiters multiple times in half a dozen years.   The worst part about this restaurant is that it is LOUD. Don't go here if you want to have an intimate conversation. The problem is that it's crowded, the floors are concrete, and they blast music WAY too loud. I'm not a fan of loud restaurants but I love the food so much that I still come here.",

I always get the Kobe beef; it is so tender it melts in your mouth and is always cooked perfectly.  The DBF is a big fan of the turkey burger, which has a terrific pure turkey flavor, like Thanksgiving.  The veggie burger is tasty and very different from all others that I have had; the interior is almost the texture of mashed potatoes, but the outside has a slightly crispy crust.  There are lots of interesting shakes on the menu too.  The restaurant is dark but has a fun and hip vibe, and there are TVs in every booth.  Service can be great, sit in Ashley's section if you can.  She is awesome:  fun, friendly, and really keeps on top of things.  The DBF is not a big fan of Las Vegas, but I think the thought of never going to Burger Bar again (or Hussong's Cantina, but that's another review) is enough to make him reconsider going back!",

    "text": "I met an out of town friend here for dinner before the Michael Jackson One show.  I've been wanting to try the Burger Bar and it was convenient for having dinner and getting to the 7 o'clock show.  I had read reviews of friends on Yelp and had decided what I was going to get before I got there.  Then I looked at the menu there and I changed my mind.  While we were studying the menu, our server brought our drinks and he kept my iced tea refilled during the meal.  I opted for the Hubert Keller burger which is ground buffalo meat.  It's topped with caramelized onions, bleu cheese, and baby spinach served on a ciabatta bun.  Finally, it's served with a red wine and shallot sauce which the menu states is Keller's favorite sauce.  I ordered the burger rare.  The server asked if I wanted it cool inside and yes was my answer.    It was served exactly the way I wanted it--red, cool meat.  The burger was very tasty and very juicy.  It was better buffalo than I've had in the past.  I also got a side of skinny fries which were good but nothing special.  It was also a small amount for the price.  As for Chef Keller's favorite sauce, I didn't find it all that flavorful.  I poured some on the burger and some on the bun but I got no flavor of cooked wine and shallots.  This is a good burger joint.  The place was crowded and noisy when we got there, but the crowd thinned out as we were there.  I guess I know how to clear a room.  I'd like to try his foie burger.  Had I known that when I went to the casino before the show I'd hit a $120 bonus, I'd have gotten the foie burger.  Oh well, another time.",

When I came here for a late lunch and comparing other Yelp reviews, I have to say that to make one's visit more worth it here is to just try their Rossini burger, which costs a whopping $60. I am always looking for a better deal, so if you try their Build-Your-Burger and use the same ingredients, it actually costs about $6 more. Overall, the Rossini burger is your best option to try their foie gras, because it contains the best ingredients to make that burger POP and taste OH SO GOOD.  So what did I think of it?  We ordered two orders of the Rossini burger, which comes with Kobe style Wagyu beef with sauteed foie gras and shaved Black truffles and Black Perigold Truffle sauce on an onion bun. Frankly, I chose this burger only for the foie gras feature. Considering that duck liver is considered illegal in CA, I might as well make my trip to Vegas worth it and get it while it is still legal in Nevada!  Let me just say that it is absolutely delicious! The patty and truffle were solid and flavorful with the foie gras. The foie gras was SO GOOD! Absolutely creamy and what one expects foie gras would taste like! We substituted our skinny fries for fat fries and ordered the Truffle Mayo dip - definitely try it! It's so good and the server gave us free extra Truffle Mayo dip! GREAAAT PLUS!! **  As for desserts, we had the Pumpkin Spice milkshake to go. It tastes just like pumpkin pie. Yummy for those who are fans of pumpkin!  Looking back, I would say that $60 is probably a bit too much, but I think it was more worth for the experience and to try the foie gras. So if you haven't been here, try this place at least once! When one is in Vegas, might as well go BIG or go HOME!! =)",

We decided to try out burger bar because of the great ratings, but was disappointed  We got to the restaurant and placed our order there to bring back to the room. I decided to do a custom burger with just kobe beef patty on a ciabatta bun with lettuce tomato and red onions. Also got sweet potato fries 'cause what's a burger w/out fries?!  Honestly, the fries were better than the burger. I remember finishing the whole box of sweet potato fries. They weren't too oily and were crispy. The burger was such a shame. Patty was overcooked and it's \"Kobe\" Sure didn't taste like kobe beef though. It was so dry and lacked the fatty flavor that I normally get from Kobe burgers at most restaurants. In addition, there were no juices coming out from the patty, that's how dry it was.  Do yourself a favor and get a real burger at Gordon Ramsay's BurGR",

The fact this restaurant is part of Huber Keller's culinary universe made it even better.  Mid-afternoon, the joint was comfortably empty, and service was quite good. I had a booth all to myself, and was able to relax and watch the most recent episode of \"Game of Thrones\" on my iPhone via HBO GO, thanks to the free Wi-Fi at Mandalay Bay. And I enjoyed an O'Mission GF pale ale with my feast. The pickle and house-made dijon mustard were added bonuses and a nice complement to my meal.  If you're not GF, there are so many more options!

Quality ingredients - no fillers, good quality beef, steak fries are huge and crispy but soft inside.  They pay attention to details: the peppercorn sauce is separated.  After you finish your burger, you don't feel thirsty like the other places (don't know the reason for this, use of msg perhaps?)  Their milkshakes are classic, high quality ice cream is used, not too sweet.  Very smooth, that you can drink from your straw, no lumps at all.  The only reason why it's not five stars is that it's a bit pricey for a burger, albeit it a perfectly executed one at that.  Expect to pay between $15 to $20 for one which includes fries.",

The Hubert Keller burger is buffalo meat, baby spinach and blue cheese in a ciabatta bun. It comes with its own special sauce too. My partner ordered the Spicy Lamb burger (also in a ciabatta bun). Our burgers came with a side of the skinny fries. The Nutella milkshake was soooooo decadent and heavenly! I loved it. The blue cheese and the special sauce gave the Hubert Keller burger a uniquely delicious twist. BUT it didn't really wow me. I have had better burgers in my local area. The spicy lamb got a thumbs-up from my partner. As for the skinny fries...I didn't really like it. I couldn't even finish it. I love French fries and can usually finish my order. But I just couldn't with the skinny fries. I think it had something to do with the texture and taste.  Finally, a kudos to our server who was very attentive and knowledgable about their menu.

Nevertheless, try this place while in Vegas, you may find some greater excitement in the food that I didn't?",

I highly recommend getting the think fried versus the skinny ones. They are much tastier and if you're a fry fan like me, much better compliment to the wings.",

    "text": "Yay, I'm an instant fan.  I'm trying to ignore the fact that I pounded a few beers on an empty stomach before arriving here, but nevertheless...  I ordered the most \"famous\" patty on their menu (which comes in around at 11 bucks). After you pick your patty and your bun, you get to choose from a plethora of toppings... and by plethora, it's like an endless list of goodies (note, you get your standard fare of lettuce and tomato on here)  Portabella mushrooms, guacamole, 3-4 different types of bacon, like 8 varieties of cheese, grilled onions, some special sauces... I was just so overwhelmed and in a good way. They even had some truffle oil to be drizzled atop your burger and that comes in at a whopping 30 bucks. I opted for a burger on sesame bun with a fried egg and bacon. It felt like the BEST burger I have had in a long while. The egg oozed out some yolk and that just made for pure gluttony. I actually am getting heartburn writing about this...  Alongside your burger, you can pair it with some fries. I opted for the sweet potato fries and they were a welcomed treat. They didn't mess this one up.  All in all, I really enjoyed the dining experience and I'm inspired to make another trip out to Vegas and definitely hit up this spot again. Everyone I went with was sooo pleased as well. Man, mouth is watering right now, ugh!",

I barely could resist, I know I was going straight to a 3-card table and losing three times that amount after dinner, but I didn't pull the trigger...I have to find out why a burger costs $60?

Build your own, choose from the Chefs menu. No matter. Add a side from several great choices.  In addition, the beer list alone could keep the lights on. Domestic lite beer drinkers, I recommend you go beyond yourself and try a great tasting, well, anything else.  Not being one who easily gives 5 stars anywhere. Burger bar should receive 6.

The service here is pretty great, despite how busy it was when we went.  Our waitress was really friendly and attentive.  The only real drawback is that if you build your own burger, the cost of additional toppings can add up pretty quick.  The concoction I mentioned above was close to $20, but considering they have a $60, it didn't seem so bad.  I can't wait to go back and Hubert Keller has himself a new fan.",

I decided to keep my add-ons simple so I could concentrate on the taste and flavor of the kobe beef. I only selected carmelized onions, lettuce and tomato and a light spread of mayo. I liked that the Burger Bar offers an array of bread and bun options. I went with wheat and was highly satisfied with the bread to beef ratio which was more beef than bread and I didn't run out of bread during my last few bites as is usually the case elsewhere.   When I was done with my burger my plate was dry which earns major points with me because I hate soggy burgers that I can't put down between bites because the plate is a soggy soupy liquidy mess. I also hate dry burgers but this magical burger was neither dry nor dripping! It was a first!   We also ordered fries accompanied with a sauce sampler which allowed us to try 5 sauces of our choice. I enjoyed tasting all the different sauces and going back and forth between them all to decide which was my favorite. I ended up concluding that the white bbq sauce was the one I was most into.   For now...this burger is the reigning champion of the best burger I've ever had....I may only want Kobe beef burgers from now on.",

Came here for lunch on a Sunday, during the NBA playoffs. Wait time was about 10-15 minutes, not bad. There's plenty of TV screens above the bar and at every booth, there's a TV screen as well, awesome!   I ordered a medium well Kobe burger ($17.50) w/ swiss (+$0.70), portobello mushrooms (~+$1.00), & caramelized onions (~+1.00). So after the added toppings, total for my burger was about $20.20 (dammmmmmmmnnnnnnnn)   I thought the burger was one of the best burgers I've had. The kobe meat melted in my in mouth, it was tender and was full of flavor...delicious!! We also ordered onion rings, skinny fries, and fat fries. I thought they were average.  I probably wouldn't come back though, $20 for a burger is quite a lot.",

Also, the veggie burger was only $9 (unlike some of the $22-24 burgers in some reviews here).   We did try the sweet potato fried and definitely lived up to its hype. We also indulged with a Nutella milkshake but with vanilla icecream (it comes with chocolate icecream otherwise) and liked it lots.   I'd say if in the area, try it out.

    "text": "I must say that Hubert Keller can definitely make some stellar burgers.   The Burger Bar is LOCATED in the Mandalay Palace (Between The Mandalay Bay and Luxor walkway) is one of my favorite places to get a burger in LV. One, I love the   QUALITY OF MEAT. They have great choices to choose from such as Angus, Lamb, Buffalo and my favorite Kobe. Not only is the meat good, they also have great buns. I think they work out a lot. PRICES here are very reasonable and in my opinion, excellent for the quality of food. If you a balla or if you just won a few bucks gambling then I would recommend you try the ROSSINI. It's a 60 dollar burger that is made with Wagyu Beef and foie gras.  I can tell you that it's worth it (If your a burger lover and like foie gras that is) Similar to other burger joints, the Burger Bar offers specialty burgers or you can customize your own. My recommendation would be to do both if your with someone else or if your really hungry.   The ENVIRONMENT here looks like  your average bar and grill. Dim lighting and lots of TV's.  They even have TV's in every booth. This place has always been crowded and there was always a wait list whenever I ate here. I have said this in many of my other reviews but if you don't like to wait then go and eat early to beat the crowd.   The SERVICE has been good on both visits. They took care of us well which was pretty impressive considering how busy they get.  Overall, I can always count on this place to satisfy my burger needs whenever I am in LV.  I give this place 5 stars because I believe that the quality of food for the PRICE to go along with their SERVICE is worth it.",

    "text": "FOOD - 5 stars AMBIENCE - 3 stars (meh - boring/any old bar and grill feel) SERVICE - 3 stars (meh - passable/not bad enough to complain)  This was our first time at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  We selected:  1) Chef's favorite burger with two changes: swapped out buffalo for Kobe beef; swap ciabatta for a soft whole wheat bun.  (Chef's favorite is buffalo with spinach, carmelized onions and blue cheese with a red wine and shallot reduction sauce on ciabatta) -  approx. $25  2) Build-Your-Own - Angus beef with green asparagus, oyster mushrooms, bacon and peppercorn cream sauce on a soft onion bun - approx. $17  3) Skinny (plain) fries - approx. $3  4) Glass of house merlot ($7) and glass of Red Diamond cabernet ($10)  Both burgers were amazing.  They nailed medium rare on both.  We split them in half and shared.  We savored every bite.  We couldn't really decide which we liked better.  The flavor on the Chef's Favorite might've won by a hair, but the texture on the Build-Your-Own was much nicer than the texture on the other (the crisp bacon, al dente asparagus and earthy, slightly chewy oyster mushrooms were all a nice contrast to the tender burger and soft bun; the Chef's favorite was pretty much all soft, melt-in-your-mouth-no-teeth-necessary kind of mouthfeel.)  Fries were good; not too greasy, not too salty.  We rarely ever finish an order of fries, but we ate all of these and dipped some in our burger sauces!  House merlot was fabulous minus (boring, a bit watery, not fruity like a Merlot should be.)  Red Diamond cab was much better.  It's a $10-11 solid table wine you can find at Sam's Club.  Would've liked to see a little bit bigger selection on the wine list (there were only about 4 reds by the glass and 6-7 total.)  But I guess they want you to drink beer (extensive beer list by country.)  Service was hit-and-miss with server forgetting about us twice for a long time.  Also, right after we sat down, she came by to take our order; we asked for a couple minutes, and when she returned she brought us a check.  She had already set it on the table and started to move on before she realized she had the wrong table.  That was a precursor on the service.  It wasn't horrible, it was just thoughtless.  Either she was distracted or tired or somewhat indifferent to her job (not sure which.)  Ambience was also a disappointment.  I would've expected something unique or inventive.  Nada.  Take away the menu and the food and I could've been in any average burger place anywhere.  No hint I was in a top-tier chef's restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  Kinda noisy; too many little kids and crying babies for my thinking (we had a 10:30 PM dinner.)  But for me, food is king, and the food was grand.  We were pleasantly surprised by the bill; under $65 before gratuity.  It was yummy enough that I actually thought, \"I could come back here again...tomorrow.\"",

I then saw on the menu that this restaurant was by Hubert Keller, an awesome chef, that also runs Fleur at Mandalay which I had previously had, with amazing food! Burger was perfect. Fries were amazing. Service was good! I would definitely  come back when I'm back in Vegas!",

    "text": "A burger place for everyone is hard to find, but Burger Bar is just that! From a vegan to a fine dining snoot, all types are bound to find something they can enjoy on the menu.   We used to go here regularly for their veggie burger. Even though it was a bit mushy, it was delicious, and we would order it \"well-done\" to give it a bit of extra crunch. And, now that we are back into the meat-eating world, there are even more options to select from, including turkey and the pricey Kobe, even buffalo. You can get salmon too, fish-lovers.  But, what I truly enjoy about Hubert's burgers are the endless options for customization. There are around 50 choices of toppings, which means your burger never has to be the same thing twice. You can throw foie gras on top if you're fancy (I am not). Or grilled zucchini if you have a thing for green (I do). And, you can get a very simple mixed green salad on the side for $2.50 instead of fries. I have never ordered the \"Chef's Burgers\" because I prefer to dress my patty up my way.   They also have a nice selection of beer and a TV for virtually every table. Service has always been good, and really, if you order smart, the prices are darn reasonable for dining on The Strip. Note: They do accept M Life!",

I opted for the build your own burger, with ground beef, smoked gouda, spinach and caramelized onions on a ciabata bun.  It was really yummy and perfectly cooked.  The fat fries were also great, came out very hot, crispy on the outside and fluffy on the inside.  The chipotle aioli was delicious with the fries.  And as far as Vegas goes, its not a bad deal -- about $16 for the burger and fries.",

The fries it came with were so addicting. Try the white BBQ sauce, which is just BBQ sauce and mayo mixed together.   I ordered the Chocolate Burger to take back to the hotel. Oh, man. One of the best decisions I made while in Vegas. Warm donut \"bun,\" Nutella mousse \"patty,\" passion fruit jelly \"cheese,\" kiwi \"pickles,\" and strawberry \"tomatoes.\" It even came with a side of raspberry sauce, but I didn't bother using that... as you could expect, the \"burger\" was already sweet as is. But definitely order this if you love sweets! Very cute and very tasty.  I'll have to come back to Burger Bar on my next trip to Vegas and try a different burger, or make my own. The shakes also looked and sounded really great. Very affordable dinner for Vegas, especially for a restaurant owned by a celebrity chef!",

You pick your type of burger meat including kobe, sustainable, sirloin, etc and other including veggie patty, salmon, turkey, etc.  Then you can pick your bun - onion, sesame, whole wheat, ciabatta, etc, cheeses - pepperjack, swiss, american, cheddar, etc, and fixings:  lobster, asparagus, mushrooms, onions, etc, sauces - truffle, shallot reduction, etc.  Some burgers are already built for you and you got your schmancy ones including a $60 truffle burger, Lobster/asparagus burger, etc.  Pick your side of fries:  Skinny, steak, sweet potato.  First time here I picked the lobster burger which was pretty tasty, but I don't remember too much about it.  Second time I ordered a sustainable on wheat w/swiss cheese and shallot reduction.. honestly, patty didn't have much flavor, and the sauce didn't either so my burger tasted pretty bland.    Good selection of beers and small TV for each booth.  While the prices for a typical burger isn't through the roof, (around $20) your best bet if you're pinching your wallet would be the slider appetizer, three cute sliders w/fries for only $12.95.",

The first time I came here, I splurged and ordered the $60 Rossini burger.  It was good, but definitely not the best burger I've ever had, and absolutely not worth the price.  I am embarrassed to even admit spending that much on a burger!  For less than the price of that single burger, on a return visit we got two Angus burgers with our choice of toppings, sweet potato fries and skinny fries, and an Irish coffee shake.   All were delicious except for the skinny fries which were just meh.   Not as skinny or crispy as I would have liked.  Standout toppings were the bacon, mushrooms, dijon mustard and the peppercorn sauce.",

I saw the description: Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese, I'm thinking - WINNER! Fell short!  The buffalo lacked the gamey flavor I like about the meat. It tasted like the Angus burger my boyfriend ordered, but with a higher price tag!  I must say the Buttermilk Zucchini Fries were pretty damn good! It almost tasted like a mozzarella stick because the zucchini has a melty, gooey consistency inside.  That was probably the highlight of our meal.

My google-ling taught me that Wagyu cattle \"produces a higher percentage of oleaginous, unsaturated fat than any other breed of cattle known in the world\".

We were seated quickly and had our drinks in hand within minutes. The ambiance was eclectic: there was a small television in our booth playing a sports channel, but I do not recall any audio. The lighting was dim, matching the dark mahogany wood seating. As expected, the crowd mostly consisted of visiting tourists. Attire is casual.   I ordered a Hawaiian \"burger\", er chicken sandwich. Why didn't I order a BURGER? I am not sure. I suppose the pineapple just sounded so appealing to me. Even more ironic, my cousin ordered the Salmon. I know - who orders salmon at a Burger joint?! Apparently fresh fish , particularly salmon, is hard to come by where she lives.   Anyway, my chicken sandwich arrived and to my chagrin, the chicken tasted very dry. The pineapple I was craving didn't really compliment the chicken as I had anticipated. I suppose I can't discount them too much since I didn't order a burger; but how hard is it to cook chicken?   The salmon, however, was reportedly delicious - and I think that is what was important. My cousin was visiting, not me.   Maybe next time I will actually order a burger. Hopefully it will be a little better prepared than my chicken - juicy and delicious- as one would expect it to be.",

    "text": "First off, I only review burgers.  This place has got a great name.  I can't believe someone didn't snatch it up sooner.  This is world renown chef Hubert Keller's baby.  He has some great restaurants in Las Vegas including Fleur de Lys.  First impression of the Burger Bar is that it's laid out pretty simply and looks like a place I would enjoy coming to.  The staff was friendly.  The burgers were surprisingly not that special.  I expected a much higher quality burger coming from Chef Keller.  They were good, but not great.  Many better burgers are out there in Las Vegas.  This is a good place to go if you're already there and are craving a burger, but I wouldn't make a trip just to eat the burgers here.  WHAT I ORDERED: Main --- - American Kobe Beef Burger: 3/5 (meat was better than other patties, but lacking in flavor): 3/5 - American Classic: 3/5 - Black Jack Burger: 3/5  Sides --- - Skinny Fries: 3/5 - Buttermilk Onion Rings: 4/5 (good but not enough)  STAFF: Friendly  WAIT TIME: Come at the wrong time, and you'll be waiting, but at least there are some shops nearby to kill time.  PORTION: Generous  BANG FOR YOUR BUCK: A tad overpriced probably because the reputable chef  WOULD I RETURN: Maybe",

Your Mrs. wants a salad, your friends want to try the latest celebrity chef spot and the guy that tagged along just wants to know what time we're getting to the club, strip club, concert, cirque show, etc.  Tell everyone to relax and just go to burger bar.  Its a local favorite stop prior to all things MBay/Luxor for a number of reasons. 1. get the burger you want, built how you want it. 2. nobody doesn't like hamburgers (even you veggies, pretty sure they have your options too) 3. milkshakes and those spicy cheese popper things because your inner fat kid deserves to be let loose from time to time. 4. It's not JUST burgers, they've got plenty of other choices on the menu. Excellence does take time and is a little pricey but in the end you'll have a satisfied bunch.  Then you can take your Mrs. to the cirque show, your friends will head to the concert and the creeper can catch a cab to the strip club.  Everybody wins.",

    "text": "I would really give this 2 stars, but I'm upping it a little bit because the other people liked their burgers. So here is the good: we ordered one of their adult millkshakes (has alcohol) - the mint chocolate chip flavored one - which was AWESOME. Mint and chocolate and so drinkable with mounds of chocolate whipped cream and an oreo - what's not to like? It actually didn't taste like alcohol at all, which was good for me, but got us wondering what we were paying for.That came before all our food so I was kinda stuffed by the time I got my burger. My mom had the chicken burger on a wheat bun without additional toppings and my friend had the salmon burger with blue cheese on a sesame bun. Both said that their meats were cooked really well.   I was way waaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaay less impressed. I had the veggie burger since I'm vegetarian, which had an awesome description but was pretty effing bland. It was made of mushrooms, brown and white rice, lentils, caramelized onions, peas, and potatoes. It tasted just faintly of lentils and the mushy texture added nothing to the experience. I had mine on ciabatta bread, which wasn't toasted enough to my liking so it was kinda too soft. We also ordered sweet potato fries which were good, but nothing special. Same with the zucchini fries, which actually seemed like every generic burger joint zucchini sticks which you can buy in a freezer section. I was SUPER excited about their deep-fried pickles, and sorely disappointed - they were pickle spears, not chips, and the beer batter was crispy but way too heavy.   I don't get why people think this place is so good - must be all the toppings. But if you have to rely on toppings, anything will taste good for a price, won't it?  When the milkshake is the best part of my meal, suffice it to say that I won't be coming back. Too bad. When you go to a top chef restaurant, you expect top chef food.",

My friends, who are lovers of foie gras, were excited to try the Kobe burger with seared foie gras (which is now banned in CA). This burger was an expensive $60, and my friends were really disappointed by the taste. The foie gras pieces were small and not of good quality. Good thing I opted out of the foie gras burger! I ended up just getting the American Classic, which was not any better. Nothing super great about it, meat was whatevers, and the burger actually came out a lil cold. It did not taste like \"right off the grill\" temperature. Would not spend the money or come back!",

On top of that I love the fact that I can create my own slice of meaty goodness.

I've been here twice, and the first time I rated this as the 4th or 5th best burger in town. But the issue was that I got one of their pre-made selections on the left side of the menu. I think I got a Peppercorn burger or something, but it was a \"good\" not \"great\" experience.   The next time I got adventurous and made my own burger. When you mix a high quality meat with the bun/cheese/toppings that you like, this burger will blow your minds. It was a little more expensive with the high-quality beef, but worth every penny.  What's that, and they have a good beer selection?  Make-your-own milskshakes you say?  I only have good things to say about this place. Go here. Go here now.",

With the blue cheese, spinach and caramelized Onion on Ciabatta bread made this burger a Father's Office <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/fathers-office-los-angeles\">yelp.com/biz/fathers-off...</a> burger with buffalo.   I LOVE Father's office burger and now I love Hubert Keller's burger!  I really don't know why I like Buffalo burger so much, but I just find them so flavorful and juicy but with texture and not mushy like beef tends to be sometime when it is too juicy.  $22 IS a bit overpriced for a burger.  But attaching a name like Hubert Keller is like buying a $2,000 Prada bag if you love good food lol.  The restaurant is literally a Burger Bar.  It looks like a kick back sports bar that serves burgers.  There seems to be always a wait to get seated at this restaurant, but if you don't mind sitting at the bar, it's pretty easy to grab a seat since people who sit at the bar are always on the go.  Hubert Keller said on Top Chef masters that he serves $5,000 burgers and they people actually order them... I wonder what's in his $5,000 burger!  Next time I come here, I want to try building my own burger :) yummy!!!  *edit* I made a mistake, his $5000 burger is served at Fleur de Lys, his other restaurant at Mandalay Bay.  \"Created by French chef Hubert Keller, Fleur Burger 5000 Fleur Burger 5000 The Fleur Burger 5000 is a luxury burger served at Fleur de Lys at Las Vegas' Mandalay Bay. The Fluer Burger 5000 is made from Kobe beef and topped with black truffles, foie gras, and served on a brioche truffle bun with a special truffle sauce. The burger is served with a bottle of 1990 Chateau Petrus in imported Ichendorf Brunello stemware, which they let you keep.  Looking at their menu, some of the appetizers include burgundy escargot with garlic and parmesan gnocchi and smoked salmon raviolis with guacamole. A sample of the entrees include filet mignon with braised oxtail tortellini and slow roasted Alaskan king salmon with a parmesan and herb crust, artichokes, lemon, and capers. The Fleur Burger will set you back $5k, but hey at least they send you a certificate of authenticity and some Italian Ichendorf Brunello stemware.\"",

    "text": "Wow! I never even knew this place existed and now I can't wait to go back. My amazing girlfriend brought me here on our recent Vegas getaway. This is one of the best burgers I have ever had. Yes I just said that. One of the best burgers I have ever had and I have had a lot of them. I love cheeseburgers. I think I am ruined on burgers after this. It is a nice place. One long bar with tables and some cool booths. I think it is great that they can text you now when your table is ready. No buzzer to carry around and if the wait is long you can wander farther away. It is a sign that this was the busiest place in this little area. There are a lot of other restaurants in this little area but this was the busiest. I now know why. You can build your own burger and shake. Anything you want. Really anything. If you really go crazy you can get a $100 burger. You think that is crazy but I would say from the first bite you would say it was worth it. Mine came in about $20 and it was so good. From the first bite to the last. I didn't even get anything crazy. I just got an Angus patty, cooked medium, jalapeno bacon, Swiss cheese, a fried egg and their spicy ketchup. It is tempting to pile stuff on because you see so many toppings that you like but trust me 4 is enough. Too many and you have too many flavors going on and you overwhelm the burger. Mine was just about perfect. Cooked just right. It feel apart when you bit into it and melted in your mouth. The jalapeno bacon and the spicy ketchup had just the right amount of kick. Just what I was looking for. For the shake I got chocolate ice cream with Oreos, hot fudge and mini marshmallows with whipped cream on top. The straw is huge. Almost hard to get your mouth around but big enough so nothing gets caught. It was so good too. Creamy and chocolaty. So good. The service was great too. Water always full. They gave us time to pick out exactly what we wanted. I really can't wait to go back. We almost went back a few times but wanted to try other places. Guaranteed when we come back to Vegas this will be one of our first stops. For sure.",

We received teriyaki. It was icky.  Ruined the burger. We got 1 burger & 1 beer and it was almost 38.00.  So I'm not happy.  She brought us a discounted check. The manager took off 3.00. Sorry but that didn't cut making me feel better for feeling ripped off that bad.  It was alright but surely not even better than habit burger or something  in the 6-8.00 range.

    "text": "Went to Burger Bar with a large group of yelpers (Shawn H's UYE).  I ordered the angus burger with pepper jack, jalapeno bacon, avocado on ciabatta and a side of truffle mayo.  I opted to skip the fries and get a chocolate peanut butter milk shake instead.  The shake was amazing.  One of the best shakes I've had.  When our food came my plate had fries and it looked like the wrong burger because I didn't see any avocado but I didn't want to touch it to check.  I told the waitress that I thought it was wrong and she said it was right.  She argued with me saying I didn't order avocado and then finally brought me some avocado on a plate for me to put on my burger.  I open up my burger to add the avocado and the cheese was all white with no peppers at all so I didn't think it was pepper jack, and the bacon was definitely pepper bacon and not jalapeno bacon.  I think she might have confused the pepper jack with pepper bacon? I'm not sure.  It was very loud in the restaurant so that could have been part of it also. I don't appreciate the waitress arguing with me though.  I know what I freaking ordered.  I'm a yelper.  I looked at the menu and knew what I was going to order before I got here.  So I ate the burger with the avocado she brought and just left the wrong cheese and bacon.  After the avocado fiasco I didn't want to deal with her anymore.  I didn't enjoy the burger at all.  Not sure if the right bacon and cheese would have changed that.  It just wasn't good.  I didn't even eat half the burger and I was starving when I got there.  She didn't charge me for the fries even though I said I would pay for them.  My total for the burger, shake and auto gratuity was $30.  Pretty pricey for a burger, especially one that wasn't very good.  A few others at our table didn't care for their meal either.  I'm wondering if I just got Burger Bar on a off day.  I have heard such good things I will be back to give them another try.",

I assume that as a tourist trap, the burgers have become what they have for feeding the masses. Reading the descriptions I was very intrigued; upon tasting the burgers, I was not. Not disgusted by any means, but just not impressed. The buffalo meat was delicious though.  I'd also assume that the fries a place like this offers should be great in one way or another and I found none in both types.   Overrated is quite the perfect word for this place, just like most of Vegas. Some places are, while being overrated, worth trying just, or at least, once. This place, I found no merit for. Reminds me of an airport restaurant. I'm not mad I tried it, but I wouldn't be recommending anyone to go out of their way to.",

The menu has changed slightly with different beef choices, an Angus and a Waygu instead of American Kobe.  Stuck with the standard Angus which was delicious.  Discovered they have picked green tomatoes as a side which were fantastic.  Got an order of the Burger Bar Ketchup which was fantastic as well.  Nutella shake was very rich and tasty, but I think I could make a decent reproduction at home and save myself $8 and change.  (I mostly tried it to see what it tasted like so I could recreate it at home)  Our waitress was excellent and always made sure our drinks were filled.",

Currently, actively working my way through their Chef's Burgers portion of their menu -- I have had the Surf/Turf (not my favourite), the namestake Hubert Keller Burger, and a third one that I am not sure of which one it was now -- only on one occasion was my burger not cooked to temperature (asked for 'medium rare'; was brought 'well done').   Back to the dessert burgers. Goddamn is that creamy cheese cake burger one good.   The service has been hit or miss for us here. They can be busy -- and I can understand busy -- but there are other places that are busy but still take your order fairly quickly and more importantly bring you your desserts after ordering them in a timely manner.   The weaknesses in this area force me hand in a four-star versus a five, although anyone can come here and easily have their five-star experience on a routine basis. Food is great; boy, those dessert burgers cannot be overstated though. - E  *That is until you try the sweet potato fries at BurGR.",

A small, somewhat-cramped eatery in the halls of the Mandalay Bay, Burger Bar is exactly what you'd expect from a Las Vegas casino restaurant:  A little over-priced because of the location, but with plenty of options and a solid effort at quality.  My burger wasn't delicious. It was good, but that's it.  It's hard to find a place that'll cook a medium rare burger, and this place only came close.  But it has a nice set of options, including gluten-free buns and kobe beef.  I definitely recommend the sweet potato fries and a few different sauces (truffled mayo anyone?).  I had a decent chocolate milk-shake while I was there, too.  I wanted to rave about this place.  I loved the menu and got excited about my order.  But I ended up finishing my meal without one of those \"MMMMMMM\" moments.  If you crave a good burger and don't feel like leaving the casino, it's a fine offering.",

The second you bite into it the whole thing comes apart like rice I guess. I had better else where, and was very disappointed. The Lamb burger had a smell to it and was not all that to say the least. I had better and cheaper Lamb burgers elsewhere and was very disappointed with my experience,   I find this place to be Extremely Overrated and a Rip-off to your wallet.

My burger was decent and the only thing that was good there was the spicy ketchup (but I'm not sure if it was worth paying an extra $1 for it... I can mix tabasco with my ketchup for free).    Anyway, I tried their \"American Classic\" which consists of an angus burger on sesame bun with lettuce, onion, and tomato.  You can have the burger cooked the way you like and it comes with a side of \"skinny fries\".  No ladies... that does not mean less calorie like the \"Skinny Girl\" drinks.  What \"skinny fries\" mean here is slender looking fries (like McDonald's).  What was pretty awesome was how they let you do a mixture of fries and sweet potato fries.    Overall, not a place I would ever recommend anyone visiting. I would rather tell you to take that $20, place a $15 bet on a blackjack table and use the other $5 to get yourself a burger from McDonald's.",

My favorite thing to eat is burgers and this is on my top 2 list with the blue cheese burger @ bubba burgers in hawaii.  Foie gras and truffles = an experience in itself, i could eat both of these things 3 meals a day and die a very happy man  Skinny fries perfectly cooked and seasoned  Onion rings with ranch = say no more  Mac & Cheese + fryer = duh, amazing  Beers on their list for days, bottles and draft, had a pitcher of an IPA today, great pick with a burger.

I'm not much of a gourmet burger kind of guy, but maybe thats because I've never had Burger Bar before.  I opted to get the angus beef burger cause that seemed like the most popular choice. I also added bacon to my burger because cmon...bacon... We just got into vegas that day and was already pretty tired from the drive so I was ready to eat and knock out.   The burger itself was so juicy and so flavorful. The 2 main things I always look for in a meal is texture and flavor, and man did this burger deliver. Every bite seemed to taste better and better as I went on. The bacon that was in my burger was just the icing on the cake. It was cooked exactly the way I like it, which is right on the border of soft and crispy. This made the texture of each bite soft, juicy and chewy all at the same time while packing a punch of flavor.  I definitely would recommend this place to pretty much anybody. Even though each burger ended up being close to $20, I felt like I completely got my money's worth. Next time I go, I definitely want to try some of the more expensive options",

As a caloric  indulgence, I also got the Black & White milkshake. For $8, I really wish that there was more milk shake and less whipped cream! The glass is also very tall, skinny, and deceiving.

I have been coming here for years and am a loyal customer.  Mandalay Bay is not a centralized location for where I like to stay on the strip but I make a point to come here every trip.  I like it that much.  There are a few tricks to this place though.  You get to pick your burger meat and I honestly think when a reviewer chooses the wrong meat, they feel like this place isn't good.  The trick is that you only need to order the Angus beef burger.  If you get the vegetarian fed beef selection you are simply not going to get that fatty, juicy flavor a burger needs!  Come on people, if you were in the Donner party, would you have selected the skinny person or the fat guy to eat?....lol  The fat is what makes a burger juicy and delicious.  Also, a burger is really only supposed to be cooked medium at the most.  If you really want a juicy burger, anything else will dry it out.  I love the fat fries but my friend swears by the skinny ones.  Maybe I am just prejudice against anything skinny, i dunno :)  I read a review on here about the Nutella milkshake.....OMG!  That was a freaking awesome choice.  I almost couldn't finish that and the meal.  It is almost too much....Notice I said ALMOST?  That's right, I kicked it into FAT GUY gear and took it all down baby!",

The timing has never been right as we rarely visit the strip but a few nights ago after taking my little brother to scope out some UFC fighters after the event at Mandalay bay we thought what better timing, kill 2 birds with one stone if you know what I mean.   Menu is simple burgers can come from a burger menu where toppings are already picked for you with a set price or build your own. I Chose the option choose my protein and build my own burger. They have angus beef, buffalo,Kobe beef, even salmon and chicken and other options if meat isn't your thing.   Build your own burger option can be kind of pricey if you're not careful each topping is an additional price. It can also be a bit much if you're drunk and can't decide or if you're like me and are very indecisive. It's best if you know what you like.   My custom burger - Angus beef patty medium on a potato roll with grilled pineapple, pepper jack cheese and jalapeno bacon. Chipotle aioli on the side.   The fiance chose a angus beef patty medium on a sesame roll with Swiss and an over easy egg.   Sides - skinny fries and jalapeno onion petals.   My burger was juicy and flavorful. Peoperjac didn't add much heat like I thought and the jalapeno bacon tasted like regular bacon. The sweetness from the pineapple went well with the chipotle mayo. Overall I was happy with my burger. The fiance however had a huge mess as the burger fell apart and he was left with a piece of burger with a yolky mess as everything fell apart and he ended up finishing it with a fork. He's not one to send back his food, because he thinks they'll tamper with it, so he did not want to say anything and just bit his lip about it.   Skinny fries were standard fries and the jalapeno petals weren't spicy like I had hoped no kick at all.   Overall service was a ok and my burger was great but I don't think my guy would like to come back to this place. After all we try to avoid the strip unless we have to go there. 3 stars since my juicy burger was the perfect way to curve my midnight munchies.",

I have eaten here numerous times. 1st time I ever saw and tried the now popular \"sweet potato fries.\"  I did find my last few times here that rather than ordering my burger \"medium rare\" or \"medium\" I had to tell them what color I wanted it.  I had to send my burger back 2 or 3x otherwise.  Now I know.  Tell them what color you want it and see how they define that before you place your order.

The only thing that changed were the prices, and these burgers cost a pretty penny now, especially if you want to customize your burger, you may end up with a little sticker shock.  ALOHA!!!

I got an angus burger with guac, American cheese, & caramelized onions on ciabatta bread with a side of onion rings. The bread and onion rings were great. The burger tasted like it was grilled/smoky (it had the grill taste) but i did not like the caramelized onions. They were mushy and too sweet. Side note, they forgot my guac so it was separate in a container. Also, it comes with lettuce, pickle, red onion, & tomato on the side. I tried the cinnamon honey mustard and it was good.  The only downside is that it's really rich and I couldn't eat all of it.   Ps. After we left, it got really crowded (line outside the door)! Reservations recommended.",

We are pretty sure that our waitress was newer, although it was hard to tell since we only saw her for our orders and then check.  We had to flag other servers down for silverware and drink refills.  We went late, far after the dinner rush so there really was no excuse.  The wait time for the food was ridiculous, especially since it wasn't cooked perfectly.  Our food was okay.  Both got build your own burgers.  We asked for medium well and probably a fourth (and not in the middle, but on the side) was rare.  We waited soooo long foe our food though that I just ate what I could and left the rest.  Sauces were excellent.  Skinny fries were tasty.  Overall, not impressed.  I'm so bummed that it didn't live up to the hype.",

Let's make this simple with a pro and con list  Pros - We sat at the bar, and thus did not experience service problems as some reviews have state, bartender was quick, friendly and on point - Dirty Dog IPA was awesome - all of our beer from draft was perfect temps and poured correctly - Fat fries, salad, all that was excellent  Cons - Where this is located is a pain.  It's pretty much dead middle in the walk between Mandalay and Luxor - maybe not a con for others but wasn't convenient for us - The burgers were undercooked - all 3 of us ordered medium and all 3 got blood on the plate and the bun.   Was way to hungry to send it back, unfortunately. - The burgers were not well seasoned; if not for having pepperjack on it, it probably would have tasted like nothing at all.  The prices were pretty brutal for a burger and fries, but that is expected on the strip, so not going to put that on either list.  Bottom line is if you are going to showcase yourself as a burger joint and name your restaurant on it, you should be a perfectionist on it.",

It's a convenient place at the hotel.   We ordered the cheese quesedilla, which came with sour cream, fresh salsa, and a type of guacamole sauce (looked like a green mayo).  Typical quesedilla.  $12 (OUCH on the price).  A side order of fries was $5.  I ordered the cesar salad with chicken ($16) and asked for some onions to add to the salad.  The salad was nicely prepared, but the salad dressing tasted a bit cheap and bland.  I only ate half of the salad.  Best thing of the meal was the great customer service from Heather.  She really took the time to be patient with our tables and she was very helpful throughout the meal!  Thanks a bunch!

I recommend getting the zucchini fries or poblano poppers. I got the \"Low Carb\" burger which was very good and I appreciated an alternative to a bun was available. The vibe of this restaurant was more \"food chainy\" so I wasn't too excited about it. I think going to Vegas you want to eat at places with a lot of character and this just didn't make the cut. It felt very ordinary, nothing wrong with the food though.",

Good variety of items to try and we tried various burgers. I ordered the house special for the lunch at a medium rare. Burger was seasoned appropriately. Lightly sauced. The beef out closer to medium well. A side of golden steak fries were served along side. Water refills through the meal had to be requested.   Check settlement took a bit longer after finishing the meal.   Good: fries were tasty. Burger was seasoned appropriately.  Bad: mediocre service, slightly overcooked for my liking was the burger, and a little overpriced for being away from center of the main strip.   Willing to try again someday but so many options.",

I was very tempted to order the $65 Wagyu Truffle burger but my vendor who was taking us to lunch would have bitch-slapped me into the Luxor.    We started with some wings and various appetizers which I tried in vain not to fill up on.  I ended up doing a Kobe build a burger and wow was it amazing! My co-workers somehow had room for milkshakes and they said they were incredible.

My brother and I got the build your own burgers and got both reliable toppings and a couple of premium and fancy condiments! Both of us enjoyed our burgers and I got a vanilla shake with, yes, vanilla vodka.   The only thing I will say is that the food is a little on the expensive side (even for a burger!). Still, I enjoyed it so I guess that is all that matters at the end of the day!",

The ultimate bloody Mary itself was great but the slider on top was horribly dry, tasteless and I'm pretty sure the bun was stale. Sure it is a drink topper but that doesn't mean it shouldn't be done well especially for $20 a pop. I also had zucchini fries and while I appreciated that they did not disintegrate into goo as some do the breading was just too much, thick and strongly flavored like frozen mozzarella stick breading so you could hardly taste the zucchini.",

We also got 3 different fries in our fry sampler. We got the truffle, garlic and steak fries. My favorite had to be a toss up between the truffle and garlic fries. I actually ended up spreading the truffle and garlic aioli into my burger and it transformed it into a Wagyu truffle garlic burger. It was ahh-mazing! This place is definitely worth checking out and was my first good meal in Vegas!",

    "text": "My wife and I finally went back to this restaurant after a sabbatical.   In the past this was our go to Burger place, as the burgers were homemade using freshly ground beef, including Black Angus and Kolby.   However, what really differentiated the Burger Bar from the myriad of competitors was the service, in particular the twins, Erin and Ashley, who were a fixture of this eatery.   Their knowledge of the menu, engaging personalities and customer service was amongst the best we have ever had in Vegas!  Which is why they had a loyal following to boot.   Unfortunately, they have moved on and our last few visits indicates that they are sorely missed.    Our waiters and waitresses in subsequent visits were not up to the mark in any manner shape or form.   They had sub-zero persona's and paid zero attention to to their customers which made for an unsatisfactory experience.  They also had a limited breath and scope of the menu, which to a couple of our dining associates caused a lot of unneeded frustration.   My wife and I actually knew more about the menu than they did (not good).   In one instance we ordered their jalapeno bacon as an appetizer and they delivered it when we finished our entree. Really? We also ordered a medium burger which came out dry as a bone and on a stale bun.    Alas, competition has in many instances equaled or surpassed the Burger Bar, a scenario which makes customer satisfaction a keen component in the \"Burger Wars\".   If the Burger Bar doesn't improve their customer service they will lose out to competition.   On a last note, please stop serving frozen fries, it's beneath a chef like Hubert Keller's pedigree.",

She was truthful and knowledgeable that they had gluten-free foods available.  However, our waitress was not very cordial and overall seemed unhappy to be serving us. It was a major disappointment considering our experience would have been great without this problem.",

My friends and I shared the fries sampler with sweet potato fries, zucchini fries, and onion rings, and 5 dipping sauces. The sampler came in a holder shaped in three cones. You can imagine that not a lot onion rings fit into that cone. but, they were yummy.  I was not too keen on some of the sauces. The white bbq sauce was ok and so was the basil aioli. homemade mustard was forgettable. chipotle aioli was ok. cinnamon honey mustard was recommended for our sweet potato fries but i definitely wouldn't dip my sweet potato fries in that.   2 friends shared a nutella milkshake. soooo yummy!!! so my other friend and i decided to order another milk shake. We ordered the black and white which was vanilla ice cream and cookie dough shake with chocolate whipped cream. it was ok. not worth $8.75.   i had the turkey burger on a wheat bun with pepperjack cheese, caramelized onions, and avocado. turkey patty was overseasoned, but the overall taste of it was good.   Spent about $25 on my meal including tax and tip. A bit steep for a burger joint.",

I should start this by saying that my fiance and I love burgers, we go to every gourmet and dive burger place and anything in between, that claims to have great burgers.  This was to be our first time in Las Vegas and a few friends said we had to come here - match made in heaven, etc. etc.  The walk through Mandalay Bay to get to the Burger Bar was fun, lots to see!  I did some window-shopping at Lush while we waited for a table.  The service was good, friendly, and nothing exceptional but we weren't expecting that here.  The beer selection was fantastic, and we started off by ordering a nice cold, tall beer to get started.  We took a look at the menu, it was pretty straight forward, and immediately decided on the Kobe burgers - I mean, if this is a burger place, the Kobe must be the best right?  On a friends recommendation we got the fried sampler as apparently the zucchini fries were not to be missed.   I have to say that the sweet potato fries, onion rings and the zucchini fries were fantastic, I'd go back just for that, a beer and some people watching.    The Kobe burger (cooked rare, and yes it was cooked to rare perfection) was more than just tasteless, something about it actually just didn't taste good.  I love Kobe beef, and I love my beef rare.  I didn't fuss about with cheeses and sauces and such, a Kobe burger should be all about the meat and the bun.  It was so bad both my fiance and I left half a burger behind.  No joke, a $20 dollar gourmet burger that was quite literally, inedible.      When we got back to D.C. after our trip, we rushed to Ray's Hellburger to restore our faith in a damned good burger.",

I only got the standard burger patty and that was pretty good, i bet the kobe burger is even better.  The patty was juicy and the topings were all fresh (nothing looked like it was prepped a few days ago) and the bacon is delicious for a bacon burger.  The sweet potato fries are good too, slightly sweet and crispy not stale tasting like a lot of other restaurants.   I love that you get to pick every aspect of yrour burger from the menu so you can create as big or odd a burger as you want.   Prices aren't too bad so i will definietly make a trip here next time i am in town.",

The fries, rings and fried pickles are always tasty.  You can build you own burger basically, so the bill can added up if you do not watch. For a burger, fries and a soda it is usually around $20, so be prepared when you sit down.   Considering that everyone else in town for a convention eats at Border Grill or Red, White and Blue it is worth the walk to Burger Bar because you can sit down right away usually.",

    "text": "My husband & I stayed at Caesar's & thought we would check out the casinos on the way doen the strip, then go to Bachi Burger.  As the tram was pulling in to Mandalay Bay, I saw the advertisment for Burger Bar.  We figured we would check it out as it was there & not a cab ride away.  We got there before it opened, checked out the menu & decided to stay.  When it opened, we decided to sit at the bar.  On a Friday, the restaurant was full within 20 minutes.  We took our time, ordered a beer sampler before lunch.  Both ordered build your own with the Kobe beef and potato buns.  I went simple with smoke gouda & the chipotle aoili, with sweet potato fries.  Husband got the peppercorn sauce, avocado & american cheese with skinny fries.  Medium rare.  Very pink in the middle, but the meat was so melt in your mouth my husband (who likes things a little more well done than I) didn't care.  The sweet potato fries were the best I have ever had.  The staff did not rush us, even though there was a bit of a line forming & every seat was taken. Next time we will split a burger & try a shake - they looked too good & you have your choice of spirited or not. Also, the pickle spear is a perfect dill. See you in April!!",

I got the Hubert Keller burger with Kobe meat instead of buffalo due to the yelp reviews regarding the Kobe beef. It was good meat but the taste overall was kinda disappointing.  I got the sweet potato fries with my burger which was cooked well but under seasoned.   Also fyi they charge a $2 split charge and portions were an okay size to share. :(  However ambiance was chill and service was good. Location was kinda odd, the place is located tucked away in Mandalay bays shopping area.  It was good NOT great. Sorry burger bar but there won't be a second date.",

    "text": "It's not really fair to compare the Burger Bar to other Burger places. Only on the Strip in Vegas can you blow $25 on a burger and not really care. It's actually a good value, considering that's only 1 hand of black jack for most people. I guarantee you'll enjoy this burger way more than that one hand of black jack.   The Burger bar is celebrity chef, Hubert Keller's creation. He has a few of his own burger combinations on the menu, or you can build your own from extensive options. I actually wish that Hubert Keller would have more of his own burgers on there. There are only like 6 listed on the menu. I like creating my own, but hey you are the famous chef, dazzle me.   I've been there a couple of times, so I can report on a few different burgers. I highly recommend the Surf 'n Turf burger. I'm not sure it says on the menu, but I think all the burgers are 1/2 lb. They are nice and thick. The Surf 'n Turf is Black Angus Beef, topped with a 1/2 grilled lobster tail, and grilled asparagus on a plain bun. Because I believe all burgers should come with cheese, I had them add provolone to it. Now pay attention to this next part, because I believe I have improved on Hubert Keller's creation. Order some pesto and mayo on the side. Mix it together and use this as a sauce. Yum, you'll never have a burger like that anywhere else.   You can choose different types of meat for your burger. After trying a Kobe burger on this last visit, from now on that's the only way I will go. It's about $7 more for a Kobe beef burger than the Black Angus, but it's so juicy that it melts in your mouth. The Kobe beef is actually American Kobe, so it's not crazy expensive like the real Japanese Kobe. American Kobe is a hybrid between Black Angus and Japanese Wagyu beef. It has the highest marbling of any beef in the United States, and is as fine as you can get without importing actual Japanese Wagyu beef. You also get to pick from 5 different buns and about 45 different toppings. Toppings are as plain as American cheese and are as fancy as pan-seared foie gras.   Just so I could try 2 burgers on this last visit, I cut them in half and shared them with my brother. Burger number 1 was a do it yourself Kobe burger. We agreed on provolone cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed oyster mushrooms, on an onion roll. Had the burger medium rare. The result was such a juicy burger that you didn't need any mayo, ketchup, or any other sauce. Just the natural juices of the burger with the toppings was perfection.   Burger number 2 was new on the menu since the last time I ate there. It's called the Hubert Keller Burger. The menu says it's his favorite. It's a buffalo burger with blue cheese, caramelized onions, sauteed baby spinach, aoli, on a ciabatta bun. I think the buffalo had the least amount of fat of all their burgers, as such I found it wasn't as juicy. I was expecting it to maybe have some different kind of flavor, but it didn't. It could have just been lean ground beef. It's also the same price as the Kobe, so unless you are trying to be healthy, go with the Kobe. The blue cheese was kind of medium, which wasn't a bad thing. A very strong blue would have over powered everything. Of the 3 I've had so far, it was my least favorite, but still good.   The fries were ok, but the buttermilk zucchini fries, were excellent. Got those with a ranch dipping sauce. They have some dessert \"burgers\" on the menu that I must try sometime. They use a donut for a bun and have fillings like cheesecake and grilled pineapple for example. It's so hard to save room for them though, perhaps they deserve their own visit.",

My patience did not go unrewarded, because I was graced with fantastic service and premium ingredients.  Our party of six did not daunt our waitress who was spot on with every menial, impromptu request we had.  I ordered a Kolbe beef patty on whole wheat, with sprouts, aeoli spread, blue cheese, and prociutto.  All the add-on's definitely complemented each other; my only trivial gripe is that it's quite difficult to get prociutto with a clean bite-- there's a lot of tugging, and ducking required, but that's no fault of Burger Bar.  Pricing is typical for Las Vegas, but despite the location, do keep in mind the quality of items that are dressing your burger, and it'll all make sense in the end.  Burger Bar is my new go-to spot on the way home from Sin City.  ;)",

    "text": "Maybe it was my great experience at Bachi Burger.  Or maybe it was Hubert Keller's name.  But after some friends told me about Burger Bar I expected more, a lot more.  The girl and I got a seat quickly but only because we sat at the counter.  No biggie.  The server/barista came to us quickly.  I was a little miffed because he said the shakes were huge (depicting it with his hands) and would be enough for the girl and I.  Well when it came out it was not huge--it was barely enough for one person (depicting with my hands).  And at $7--spot-on for outrageous strip prices.        Now to the food.  I ordered the Slider Trio because I wanted to try the 3 different ground meats:  buffalo, angus (i think), and all-natural.  The menu says they're cooked to medium--NO SUBSTITUTIONS!  It came with an order of skinny fries.  The gal had the angus burger and got a bunch of toppings.    Well, my sliders came out and although they were really tiny, if the menu explicitly states medium, I would tend to expect medium.  The buffalo was medium but the other 2 were medium well.  All in all, the \"burgers\" were dry, practically tasteless, and pretty much tasted the same (though in terms of ground meat tasting different I didn't expect much).    I tasted the girl's angus and you could definitely tell the difference in tastes from that and your run-of-the-mill ground beef.  But other than that it was unremarkable--dry (even though cooked to medium) and needed more seasoning.    Eating on the strip I expect to be ripped off.  But I didn't expect to literally be ripped off.  Found out after I got back to the car that they had charged us for the more expensive burger!    Sorry Hubert but although your $60 Kobe, Foie Gras and Black Truffle burger is impressive, the rest of your menu lacks culinary creativity and your basic burgers require something more that makes it better than your average diner burger.",

Okay, the restaurant itself isn't really glamorous; it's a typical bar/burger joint. At the time I dined here, the 2010 World Cup was going on, so the place was packed with testosterone-driven men of different nationalities, screaming and getting heated up. But the food is another story. That's right. I'm talking about the legendary: The Rossini. Rossini burger may overwhelm you at first. When I first saw the description, I thought to myself, \"Sure, I enjoy Kobe beef, foie gras, and black truffles, but all in one setting, in a form of burger?\" After minutes of serious hesitation, I decided to order it. If I don't enjoy the burger, oh well, at least I would have gained an invaluable experience.  Okay, the burger was good. But of course, it should be good; it has three of the most treasured ingredients in the culinary field after all. But after a couple of bites, I started to feel the heaviness of the burger and I was done before I could even finish half of the burger.  I also ordered the Nutella milkshake, but I couldn't even get to it. So if you are a lightweight diner like me, share and split the burger.",

After a brief stay at Daylight (the Mandalay Bay Beach Club), my group came here to grab some lunch. Burger Bar is located inside the Mandalay Bay Shoppes (it's sort of in the middle of things so be prepared for some walking).  Though without a reservation, we were quickly shown to a booth inside the restaurant upon arriving.  Service was superb. Our waitress was super attentive, fast, and kept our waters/sodas refilled throughout our stay.   I ordered a custom burger, choosing the Kobe beef option ($17.50 just for bun and meat - lettuce, tomato, pickle, and onion are served on the side), and grilled onion (which was about a $1.00 upcharge). I chose to get my burger cooked medium rare and that was that.  When the burger arrived, it did not disappoint! It was probably one of the best burgers I've ever had - simply tender, juicy, and wonderful with each bite to the last. There was no need to add cheese or anything fancy to this burger - just make it medium rare and have some onion and you are set.  Though definitely pricey, Burger Bar is an awesome eatery and I look forward to returning my next visit to Las Vegas.",

White BBQ, cinnamon honey mustard, garlic aioli, truffle mayo, and a second white BBQ. The white BBQ sauce is magical (if you couldn't already tell). I also tried the sliders, which are tender little bites of hamburger heaven on a mini-bun. Macaroni and cheese bites are pretty good (not my favorite) and the sweet potato fries are to die for (try them with the cinnamon honey mustard sauce! Mmmmmm).  For burgers, the surf and turf burger is a juicy burger with asparagus and large prawns on top. The hubby always gets the bison burger, with the works, and a \"black and white\" shake (read: large chunks of cookie dough that you have to suck through a supersized straw).   Service: can be a little slow on busy nights but honestly the food more than makes up for it in the long run. The price is a little high, but Hubert Keller does not disappoint with his recipes and burger-fusion! Enjoy!",

If I came back I would order a normal burger - with cheese and bread, not a bunless burger. My husband had a completely different experience. He ordered the Hangover and he thoroughly enjoyed it. We came here about an hour before our Michael Jackson show. We were served in a timely manner. Great restaurant in the middle of Mandalay Bay.",

    "text": "One of the better burger joints on the Strip.  I've only been here once, and it's been a year since I've last went there, but I do remember how much I enjoyed the Kobe Burger I had (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1LCXqYn&s=5e61b1b069d472435a99dcc9a729afe3b48d43df8dad8ca3f19bd981f28f7444\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1LCXqYn</a>).  Since it was my first ever taste of Kobe style beef, I ordered it plain and simple, just to be able taste the beef and figure out why the hell do people rave about it so much.  To be honest, I didn't notice a huge difference, but it was probably because I haven't had regular burger for weeks before that.  Needless to say, it was very good.  I was very curious about their Rossini Burger, but I couldn't come to myself to pony up $60 for a burger.  I've been hearing good things about it though, and also their Veggie Burger that I saw Hubert Keller make from scratch on his TV show.    I don't know what to say about their Chocolate Burger (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F20biv3F&s=678d1e8b30b5618ea2382dece4f3a31cad491250c7f2145bd5f2acdf1d646390\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/20biv3F</a>) as it really took me by surprise because they really did a good job making it look like a real burger.  I wasn't even sure how to go about eating it whether to knife n fork it, or eat it using my hands like a real burger.  I decided on the latter and that probably wasn't such a good idea as the strawberries and mint leaves kept falling out.  It was very good though and was a fitting way to finish your meal at a burger joint.  I'm actually happy to say that I was overwhelmed by the pure customization you can have with your burger over there.  This is why I'm very excited that the Burger Bar in SF is opening soon, so I can be finally create my burger masterpiece without having to fly out to Vegas.",

This is what I love about Vegas, culinary free reign in every shape and size at every price point. Viva!  I had a turkey burger with caramelized veggies, a side of fries, and a Nutella milkshake.

    "text": "I know this sounds a bit unbelievable, but until recently it has been rather difficult to find a good craft beer bar in Las Vegas.  Burger Bar was one of the first, and still one of the best.    Great menu offering options for nearly anyone's tastes.  From a classic burger, to a lamb burger, to Herbert Keller's favorite with ground buffalo, caramelized onions, blue cheese, and baby spinach its hard to go wrong.  Build your own burger with an impressive number of choices.  Not sure I ever remember seeing sprouts as a burger topping option, much less pan seared foie gras.  The one that hit it out of the park for me - a fried egg.  If you have never tried it, do so!  Absolutely delicious.  Multiple fry options, fantastic shakes, and even a take on a dessert burger.  Who does this?  Obviously one place that lives up to their name - Burger Bar!  One fail - the fries.  I was surprised at how fantastic my burger was, but the fries were just not up to the same par.  Not cold, but not as hot as they should be. Sitting at the bar, I turned to look at the far end of the restaurant and watched the kitchen window.  Fries are made, stacked in absorbent recycled bowls and sit in the window until served.   10+ minutes is too long for fries to sit.  My one and only complaint, and loss of a perfect score.",

Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is know for the Rossini: Wagyu kobe beef, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, madeira sauce on an onion bun. At a whooping $60, it is the cheapest burger on the Top 10 Most Expensive Burger list (the most expensive being the Douche Burger at $666).  I love foie gras, and since it was outlawed in CA (damn you), Vegas is my closest foie gras fix, of course I had to get it. Have to admit, the burger did not look impressive at all, I was on the verge of a huge disappointment until I took that first bite, and I was sold! Worth every penny! ok maybe not every penny, but def worth a one time try. Tender, sumptuous, juicy, luscious texture. Oh My GAWD! Comes with a side of seasalt and course ground pepper so you can season it to your own liking.  At $60 they also throw in dessert, I got the chocolate burger: krispy creme donut, chocolate and nutella patty, kiwi slices, strawberry, and caramel to look like cheese. I was really full at that point so I didn't eat it, but it looks way cool!",

I always enjoyed watching Hubert's cooking show where he would introduce an eclectic mix of ingredients to spice up the good old America stable of hamburgers.   You can definitely taste the quality of the meat that is used to prepare the burgers. I had asked for a medium rare burger and it came out perfectly with warm pink center just enough to keep the meat flavorful and juicy. The Ciabatta bread certainly gives the burger a more elegant look from the old sesame buns and offers a much more full-bodied texture to the burger. My girlfriend had the Kobe beef burger and didn't enjoy it as much as she wanted to. I think it had to do with the fact that she asked for a medium well burger.   The sweet potato fries were also a nice addition to our meal and added a hint of sweetness to every bite of my burger.   Conclusion - Although the prices are a bit steep for a burger, I applaud Hubert for his colorful rendition of the classic American burger and will definitely visit again on my next trip to Vegas.",

It's hard to imagine but these burgers can not be described in words only tasted. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "The only reason this place does not get a 5 star rating is because of the price!  I was there with a friend  we each had a burger and one appitizer and I had two beers.  It was 65 dollars!  Yes for two burgers.    Now that I got the price out of the way we can talk about quality.  First off they have a huge menu of different beers from all over the world, although I was infinitley disappointed they did not have Lowenbrau.  Anyway I highly recomen the American Kobe beef burger.  It was great and in my opinion very close in quality to the Japanese version, while being immensley less expensive.  My burger was $16, but I will admit it was more than worth it.  Pretty much the best burgers I have had in a very long time.  I highly resomend it, and I can tell you all that if this place was more along the lines of a reasonable spot in price (which it is not) I would probably be eating there at least twice a week, and I live 40 min from there!  Bring some money, but the product is not a let down!",

My grounded, rare meat was actually tough (and unsalted) - They mixed up the order and delivered the wrong plate to my boyfriend.  By the time they were done looking for his burger on other random tables, I had finished mine - $$$  OK, done venting.  High level summary: won't go back.",

    "text": "Became interested in this place when I saw the burger-themed challenge on Top Chef Masters. Went here for Saturday lunch, it was pretty busy with an estimated 20 minute wait. I instead sat at the bar. I wanted to try the Rossini of course, but I couldn't justify the price to myself. Instead, I went with the Hubert Keller burger medium rare (bison, spinach, caramelized onion, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun). Had a Hitachino white ale with it. In total, $30+.  Now, nothing about the food was objectionable. I ate pretty much all of it, and the portion size was definitely sufficient. By the time I got out of there, I was full. The food was decent, but it was also not very memorable or flavorful (even with blue cheese!). The skinny fries especially were quite generic and could have been served from a chain family restaurant. Maybe I've been spoiled by Father's Office in Santa Monica, but the Burger Bar food was just...alright. Add to the experience a pretty long waiting time for food, and well, I'm not running to go back. Maybe I should've done a customized burger instead.",

Yes, they do a great job elevating burgers to another level of creativity and taste, but their prices are kind of ridiculous. For two people I think our check was close to $100 without drinking alcohol. Sure we didn't need to order the surf and turf burger, but it's still just a sandwich. Is is a sandwich really ever worth that much even with bells and whistles? This really is a glamourized sports bar in a mall. The tvs do nothing for the atmosphere. I would go back, but only if someone else was paying.",

Amazing burgers, good beer and FOIE GRAS TOPPING!  They have a huge variety of beers here first of all.  A lot of foreign ones I've never heard of before.  This last time I've come here I got the house hef, which wasn't very good.  But, that's the not the star of the show.  The star is the freaking amazing burger they serve here.  Now I've never gotten any patty besides the angus patty.  I figured it's ground up beef, no point in having a super awesome one.  Spend that money on the toppings!  I got the angus burger with portabello mushrooms, foie gras and some provolone cheese on ciabatta bread.  (Wait, maybe mozzarella because they didnt' have provolone.)  Anyway.  The angus burger was damn juicy and served at a perfect medium-rare.  The portabella mushrooms were AMAZING as well.  It was juicy and so perfectly grilled.  Man, my mouth is watering as I type this.  The real star of the show was the foie gras.  And yes, it deserves its own paragraph.  A huge chunk of perfectly seared liver.  When bitten into this thing explodes.  I'm serious.  It was like the big bang in your mouth.  You literally smile as you bite into it.  Your senses run wild.  You become reborn.  It is that damn good.  And for only $12 to add it to your burger, do it.  DO IT!  Guys.  Do yourself a favor.  Stop reading the reviews.  Just go.  If you're already there, reading Yelp reviews to figure out what to order.  Just remember.  FOIE GRAS!",

Having made my decision to go with something quick and comfortable, I decided the Burger Bar was my pick of the night.  Place itself was uber busy on a weekday.  Multiple TV screens at the bar provide enough entertainment, although the booths and tables are squeezed in a bit too tight for comfortable conversation.    Went with the American Classic thinking this should be easy.  I mean, how can you mess up a burger, fries and a beer?  Ok, the Double Chocolate Stout, while not amazing, was a great way to start the meal.  The wait was quick enough.  Got my burger in about 10 minutes and was truly excited to take my first bite.  Tried another one, and another, all the while thinking .... this is it?  THIS is what the fuss is all about?  I typically get my burgers medium-rare, but after the KGB fiasco (see previous review), I decided to play it safe and go for medium.  Meat was still a bit too pink for me.  The burger itself tasted bland, as with the fries, and I am not a salt-aholic at all.   Could it have been a off night?  Hmmm ...",

This isn't biased as I've been before and had a good burger, but last night was bad.  Got sat right away but after 10 mins of no server, I stopped a busser and asked for him to send somebody to assist us.  Another 5 minutes (the place was half full so that's not the reason) and nobody.  Finally a server stopped and asked if we were ready to order.  We stated that we hadn't even been helped.  No \"sorry\" just continued to ask if we wanted to order.  We inquired about the Happy Hour specials that were advertised out front.  He had no idea and look confused.  He went to the bar to get the info and stated that we had to sit at the bar for the specials.  We then started to walk to the bar and decided that we weren't going to enjoy ourselves after this much work and we left.  Disappointed to say the least because with just average service we would have stayed and spent a fair amount on food and drinks.  Just another example of a strip outlet dropping the ball.",

The food is overpriced, undersized for Italian cooking.  We were interested in going because they advertised excellent food and fix your computer at the same time.  Wow gives a new meaning to the word bite. We thought that this was a cute idea, but after eating there it seemed that the computer thing in order to bring in money because he is hurting.   There are many great eateries in this neighborhood and people should take the opportunity to try the different restaurants, just not this one.",

I felt bad at first, like a pig...but then once I took one bite THANK GOD, no way would I want to share this amazing burger.   I decided to try something different, so i ordered the baffalo burger. It's lower in calories, fat and cholesteral. By the taste you'd never know it. You order everything ala carte so it is sort of pricey for a burger joint but worth the experience. Eh it's Vegas!! So I ordered it with the plain bun, lettuce, tomato, bacon and skinny fries. YUM YUM & YUUUMMM. I swear I scarfed that shit down like someone was going to steal it.   The rest of the table also got buffalo burgers and a black angus burger. Everyone was super happy with their meals. OH we also had the sweet potato fries and zuchini fries. Also very very good.   Makes me really sad cuz we don't have a Burger Bar. =( If you love burgers...i def recommend this place. They have a zillion toppings to chose from and a variety of buns too. Oh man....I was stuffed but it was well worth it.   Now I just read they have a chocolate burger for desert!! DAMN IT! Maybe I should have split my burger so I could have had that too hahaha.",

Where I can have a good burger and add a touch of designer flare with higher end fixin's. Cuz sometimes Heinz alone just doesn't cut it.  You have the option of what type of ground meat you want to start off with.  Anything from turkey to american kobe beef, which is a scam by-the-way.  Then I throw on some Jacob the Jeweler bling bling type sh!t on it that you won't find at  Islands.  So I sparkle my burger up with some asparagus, prosciutto, and pepperjack dairy.     Once your done with the jewelry, you can choose what kinda suit you want your burger to wear. I usually go with the Ciabatta bun (rounding up the mobster look nicely).  Honestly, you could probably combo up any of their choices and not have a bad one. They also have an adequate selection of brews. The sweet potatoe fries are a good accesory to the crime. Trill.",

About five years ago we gave up going to the fast food joints, with the exception of an occasional IN n' OUT Burger, and it only has increased our appreciation of how good a hamburger could be.  The Burger Bar in Mandalay Place is a great place to truly enjoy a good burger. They have a wide variety of burgers to choose from. Not only in toppings, but also in meat choices (Angus, buffalo, etc.) as well as bun choices.  The last time I was there I had the Buffalo burger. It's a bit pricey, but certainly worth the treat. Throw in a side order of sweet potato fries, and I was a happy guy.  This place certainly isn't cheap. Two of us went for lunch, ordered a couple of burgers and soft drinks and the bill was close to $50.  The place does get a bit crowded so be warned. I tried to take my wife there for a quick late lunch last time we went to Vegas and we were told the wait was over an hour. So, we went elsewhere. But, we'll be back!!!!",

The really cool thing about this place is you can customize the burger to put whatever you want on it, from the meat (beef, lamb, kobe, or bison) to cheese to the type of bun to the saucr to about 40 or so different toppings.  My go-to burger is the bison burger with blue cheese, avocado, shaved black truffles, and pesto mayonaisse.  It is absolutely amazing, and not too too expensive, which is a rarity in Vegas.  I make it a point of coming here at least once every time I go to Vegas, which is about once or twice a year, and I've come maybe 8-10 times at this point.  The last time I was in Vegas (for my birthday last year), my wife and I came here and also tried the fry sampler for the first time, which comes with regular fries, sweet potato fries, and I think steak fries, and you get a choice of I think 5 sauces of whatever you want off the sauce menu (we got pesto mayo, BBQ sauce, chipotle aioli, and a couple others), and it was also really good.  We left this place stuffed and happy (and leaving somewhere in Vegas happy is never a sure thing).",

I got their signature mint milkshake with alcohol and it was the best as it ever was. Its one of the best tasting shakes out there, alcohol or no alcohol I think everyone will like it. I'm not even usually a mint lover and I love that shake.   I got the kobe beef burger with sweet potato fries and onion rings and eveyrthing was delicious. The kobe beef was very tender and cooked perfectly at medium rare. A lot of places struggle with medium rare, they make it either rare or overdone so I really appreciated the fact that burger bar cooked it so perfectly. Their fried foods were great as well. This is a restaurant that I would go over and over and over because its good food, good milkshakes at a great price.",

At the burger bar the bun was noticeable larger than the piece of meat to the point that I had to tear off the bread before the first bite. The burger had a nice char taste to it and had a good thickness at about 3/4 of an inch. I just wish it was larger in diameter.  The sweet potato fries were very delicious. They had a nice sweetness to them and did not require and seasoning nor condiments.  The burger bar has an impressive selection of draft beers with an optional beer flight of 6oz selections.  The service was the biggest disappointment to me. We started with a wait of 15min which I find to be no problem. Once seated it took about 10 minutes to get our drink order and another 35 minutes before we had our meal. Our waitress was inattentive to drinks and checking up on how our meal was.  Overall the food was good but I think I will try another burger place the next time I go to Vegas.",

I've had many delicious ones in my day and when I arrived in Vegas and saw the Burger Bar sign, I thought I hit the jackpot. The wait was long, but the bar was open, so we took advantage. I had a really good pear ale to start while I looked over the menu. Burger Bar offers a build-your-own burger type of menu. One has the option of choosing from a variety of meats (including the most important one; TURKEY), types of bread, condiments, cheeses, and other toppings. I had a turkey burger with bacon, cheddar, bbq sauce, spinach, and tomatoes. It was a combination of all the things I hold dear on a burger. My taste buds and I were very excited, but I was slightly let down by my food. The toppings were good, but the turkey was dry - really dry. The french fries were ok, but not amazing. Meh, next time I am in Vegas, I will probably bypass Burger Bar. I paid a whole lot of Vegas money for a mediocre meal. It left my stomach sad.",

I'm going to get my 1 gripe out of the way, the service was very slow. I'm not sure if it was the lack of staff or what we ordered but it was a 20 minute gap between getting our milkshakes to getting our burgers. However me and my girlfriend didn't mind the wait cuz our feet were hurting anyway.  Now about the food. The Milkshakes were some of the best ive ever had in a while. I had the French Vanilla (alcoholic) which had Kahlua and a few other sweet things that tasted amazing. Thick and rich without being TOO sweet. My girlfriend got the Nutella chocolate milkshake which was good but not as good as the vanilla. The chocolate was great but a tad overpowering.   The burgers were obviously the highlight of the visit. Me and my girlfriend each ordered the Kobe beef burgers with our own favorites on top. The chef and waitresses got our orders exactly right and were very helpful in helping explain how everything worked. The meat was tender and the chipotle mayo sauce was great giving the burger enough of a kick to not make it too spicy.   The onion rings were good but nothing special, however the sweet potato fries were delicious. Go here with a hearty appetite.",

So Brian being Brian, I order the Surf & Turf Burger.  The Surf & Turf Burger is Black Angus beef burger wit half a grilled lobster, grilled asparagus and a plain bun.  I eliminated the asparagus and kept the lovely lobster.  This was like $24.25.  Would I buy this with my own cash?  No way.  However, how often do you have lobster on a burger...........most likely never.  I always order the fat fries with my burgers here because they are so utterly delicious.  Now here are some bad things people will say. -It's a little expensive.  Yes, there is no disputing that.  The burgers are a little pricey, as are the beers.  Guess what, who cares?  If you want to save money go to the buffet.  You could get a cheaper burger at In-Out Burger if you're so inclined.   -It's a simple burger place, why are the people so loud?  The staff here likes to have fun.  They may be a little loud, as would the customers.  This is not L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon.  This is a simple, yet good restaurant that should be affordable for most people. -This isn't in Mandalay Bay!  Well, technically it's not.  It's in Mandalay Place which attaches the Luxor to Mandalay Bay.  I will for strategical purposes, state that it is in Mandalay Bay.  Despite the complaints, I know though, when I come to Las Vegas...........I stop here.  The serving sizes are huge, the food is delicious and the staff is friendly.  5 stars.  *Note: I should have given this 5 stars over a year ago*",

I had to try it out for myself.   My friends and I went there on a Sunday night around 6:30pm right at Happy Hour time. The place was packed but we're able to sit ourselves at the bar. The bartenders were very nice even though we only wanted food. Fast services, friendly, and ultra good looking guys delivering your food are a plus!!   The surrounding was like any burger and pub joint lotsa plasma and booth TVs playing the pre-season football.  On to the food: I had a Blackjack Burger cooked to medium. But came out medium rare, acceptable not too red. Quite tasty. Crispy fries just like McDonald long and skinny!! Delicious pickle to go with your burger.   I really wanted to try the $5.75 Sweet Burger topped with Krispy Kreme dount, but my stomach had been filled with the ultra delicious under $15 burger. It's absolutely a steal for Vegas dining!!  Next time, I hope to try the ultimate $60 Rossini burger with Foie Gras and Black Truffles!! Sounds mouth watering...?? I bet it is...  Totally recommended!!",

I still have flashbacks to eating the one with cheese and caramelized onions! If I could only have one last burger before I died, that would be the one.  There were some more expensive burgers on the menu that I had been tempted to try, but since I hadn't ever been there before, I chose to be a bit frugal until I figured out if I approved of the burgers.  Boy, do I approve!  When I head back there though, I think I'll have to try something with truffles (my fav.!)...",

The crappy thing I don't like is that they pump music through their speakers and since music is loud, people also speak louder. Don't expect to have a nice quiet conversation with your date or friends...this ain't the place for that.  The menu is simple. You can pick one of  their set menu items or create your own burger. Reasonable priced menu especially for the LV Strip. You can choose from different meats...Black Angus, Country Natural, American Kobe, & Buffalo. For you other people not looking for meats...they have a veggie burger, chicken, salmon, or turkey. Then you can dress it up with whatever veg, cheese, or sauces, on their lists. And you can get your burgers with fries (fat, skinny, or sweet potato), buttermilk Zucchini fries or onion rings, & beer battered jalapeno pickles (never tried these). I usually keep it simple: Kobe beef on a sesame seed bun with grilled onions & spinach, with sweet potato fries or onion rings, & a $7 chocolate shake (yes I did just order a $7 shake!). The wife likes the Surf & Turf- black angus burger, grilled half lobster, & asparagus. They also have a $60 Rossini Burger-kobe, foie gras, black Perigord truffles, on an onion bun...pretty steep for a burger but if it floats your boat-eat it.  They also have a pretty good selection of beers, wines, and cocktails. Beer is beer everywhere except when it comes to the prices and BB alcohol prices are higher than other similar food joints. We always pass on the drinks.   For the most part we've had decent service. But we do avoid the lunch and dinner crowds because those are the times we've had hit or miss service. It's mayhem trying to wave down a server during a weekend dinner rush. And it seems like they play extra loud music to help to drown out the customers that need assistance LOL! Seriously, you can hear ESPN, loud music, people talking loud just to hear themselves...and that's going on all at once. BB has the unmistakable ambiance of a high school cafeteria.  Overall, BB is fun burger joint where you can create your \"OWN\" masterpiece of a burger. We like that they offer you many different selections of toppings, but beware on your add on's, they can definitely add up. You could easily be eating a $20+ burger. So bring your earplugs and just text away with your friends...and enjoy your burger.",

I was so looking forward to the Burger bar (what with the reputation of the $5000 burger and all) but was left totally unsatisfied.   I had the peppercorn burger, medium temperature. When the burger came out, the meat was literally raw in the middle. I asked the waitress if they could just heat it up a touch, I like my burger pink, not raw. She said no problem and returned with a well done patty. *sigh*. there goes my $20 on a burger.   The patty was overcooked, the peppercorn sauce was so mild that I couldn't taste it with my overcooked burger. All in all it was just such a disappointment. And quite honestly, while I'm certain that the ingredients were top notch, taste-wise, I've had much better at much lower prices. 2 Stars.",

    "text": "How can you not love a place that is casual yet takes its food very seriously?  I had the buffulo burger on ciabatta with caramelized onions, mushroom, and gorgonzola cheese.  Yum!!  You can really taste the difference between a buffulo ribeye and a beef ribeye....but no so much with a burger patty.  I probably could have ordered a less expensive beef option and still had a wonderful burger.  I ordered it medium rare and the waiter cautioned me in corporate speak that undercooking meat can cause ...blah, blah, blah....and that it will be bloody in the middle.  Bring it on I said.  Here's a hint:  When you order a custom burger then add fries they put the fries on the plate with the burger.  For the same price you can order the burger you want and a side of fries plated separately for the table to share and you get twice as many fries.  Our group of 6 ordered one side each of skinny fries, fat fries, sweet potato fries, and zuccini fries and had more than enough.",

We grabbed dinner here before a show and it was perfect for exactly this purpose, as opposed to making it the highlight of a night out.  That said, the burger I had (with bacon and cheddar cheese, $13) was fabulous and the service was great. Even the vegetarian at the table had options and was happy with her meal. Great lunch or casual dinner in Vegas.",

Our burgers were delicious. You can customize them with different toppings, sauces, etc. My boyfriend and I each chose a burger that was produced on a family farm or something. It was moist and flavorful and really hit the spot!  What's really amazing about this place, though, is their beer selection. Aside from their impressive array of tops, Burger Bar has an incredible selection of bottles as well. There are tons of IPAs, which made us San Diegans feel right at home. I'm a lambic fan, and they had three different kinds on hand! The prices were good, too, for Vegas - a pint of 8-9% beer was about $8. I loved this place and will definitely go back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

The Salad was big and bland. not much dressing or flavor and the romaine cut way to small. I asked if the burgers were prepared open face, dry bun and was told yes.  I said I preferred a fully assembled burger and I asked for 1000 island on the bun, not on the side and they said that was no problem.  The burger arrived open faced, veggies on the side but with dressing on the bun. Smallest, skimpiest lettuce and tomato I've ever seen. Meat, bacon and cheese were all quite good, bun was not. I eat fast when alone and the bun pretty much fell apart mid way through.  Fries were below average, not crisp, bland, needed salt and I cant remember the last time I had to add salt to fries.  Service was mostly non-existant  aside from taking my order and delivering food. No one ever asked how anything was. Zero attention during the meal. Had to ask for cutlery, napkin etc. No reason to return.  Over priced for what you get.",

    "text": "Holy Kobe, Batman.  Things that are good:  - Yeahhhh, burgers. I know it's become terribly a la mode to dress up your beef with all sorts of fancy toppings (burger a la mode not being one of them, I should hope, but I'm sure some molecular gastrotard has put a mustard sorbetto on top of ground beef.) Love the menu. Pick a meat (including buffalo, turkey, or veggie. How nice. But seriously. Red meat.) Pick things to put on it. Pick a roll. Pick a temp. Watch your wallet shrink. (Truffles! Foie! Lobster!) Everything was good, save the aioli. A little forward for me; couldn't really taste anything but garlic. The roll was insane.  - Really good beer selection. I picked a bad beer (I'd heard good things about Hitachino Nest but I thought it tasted like sour upper-lip sweat post-workout.) But that doesn't stop me from appreciating the overall collection.  - Our server was nice, speedy, and thorough. About as much as you could ask for.  Things that were off:  - They definitely lean more towards undercooking here, so if you're in doubt, I'd go a notch up as far as doneness is concerned. I'm of the mind that rare = good and foodborne illness = I'll take my chances, so the extremely red and wet nature of my burger wasn't so much of a problem. If you're picky, I'd say go medium.  - Waiter for the section next to ours let out a most vociferous belch while exiting the service station, and while I'm not entirely OPPOSED to a good burp, I'm also a little put off by such public displays of wanton near-regurgitation.  Next time I'm in Vegas, I hope to return.",

    "text": "Was here last week on my trip in Vegas as we were staying at mandalay bay and left red white and blue after a poor experience with service there (read my review).  But onto the review for here:  We were seated right away and instantly had our waitress at the table a couple minutes later taking drink orders. She was very good about checking up on us for anything we needed and also had a good sense of humor  I ordered the wings and made an Angus burger for my meal and shared half and half with my friend who made a chicken sandwich.  Their menu is cool because it allows you to create your very own burgers and sandwiches by choosing your meat, bun, cheese and toppings. choices were pretty broad with meat having Angus beef, buffalo, chicken, and higher qualities of beef. Buns were ciabbata, onion, sesame, and then a large selection of cheeses and toppings. If you build a burger though it does not come with fries, so keep that in mind. The burger was good and the beef was very moist and flavorful.  The chicken sandwich was a little bland even after putting on the chipotle sauce that my friend asked for but it wasn't dry which was nice.   The wings were very good but not as spicy as I was hoping for, but my friend did feel that they were very spicy. The wings also came with fries which were seasoned well and cooked well along with some carrots and celery. I did have a bite of the burger my other friend made that came with some au ju sauce which was also very good  Prices were pretty standard for a sit down burger place and the service was great. The only thing that kept me from giving it a 5 star was the bland chicken. I would return to try another creation if I am down in the mandalay our lucite area.",

I wish they would make it larger because there are restaurants on each side of it that are dead.   I had the Kobe Burger with Peppered Bacon and cheddar cheese.  They have a great beer selection where you can get samplers as well.  They had buffalo flavored fries, but the second time I went, I was sadly informed that they no longer serve them.  Everyone I went with loved the sweet potato fries.  The chipotle aioli I strongly recommend as it complents the burger just as much as the fries.",

    "text": "This restaurant, by famed restaurateur Heubert Keller touts itself as the best burger in Las Vegas and the ultimate burger experience.  Instead this place is everything you would expect from a stuck up gourmet who wouldn't know a great burger if it hit him in the face.  Don't get me wrong, you won't get food poisening here and you won't come away saying that the burgers were inedible, in fact for the most part the end result is a good burger.  I am certain however, Mr. Keller and his chefs have never seen the parking lot of a sporting event with a charcol grille and a spatula.   First, what I don't like about this place.  The burgers were cooked like a gourmet would, meaning good for a steak, bad for a burger.  All the burgers we tried were underdone and we asked for them medium.  Second, the prices are outrageous.  You will not get out of here below $20.00 per person and for a burger, that is just wrong.  Third, the service is absolutely attrocious for the price.  This is supposed to be a burger place but they treat you like the fine dining establishments, meaning rude service and slow service.  Fourth, the Kobe burger is a waste of time.  The flavor is lacking and quite honestly, you don't need the best meat to make a good burger. Fifth, the bun is boring. I expect better from a 20 dollar burger joint.  The buns we had were dry inside and soggy outside.  Now, for the good about this place. 1) you can get just about anything on your burger and you pick and choose what is on it. 2) you can get just about any type of meat on your burger from kobe to buffalo to ostrich. 3) the burger is tasty if you get them to cook it right.  The sides and drinks deliver.  Still searching, let me know your favorite burger place so I can try.",

    "text": "This place was pricey ($22 for a buffalo burger), but damn, was my burger slamming.   I think it was called the Herbert Keller burger (or some other old white guy name) and it was a massive, tender and juicy treat (pause). The meat was flavorful, the ciabatta bun was a perfect complement, and the the grilled onions tasted like they'd been scooped out of the best french onion soup. Add to this the spinach and bleu cheese that had melded together, and you have the recipe for bliss.  The salmon burger was also good, sizable and a healthy alternative to a regular beef burger. Unfortunately, the delicious fries and onion rings probably offset any health value to be found in this meal.  Still, this place impressed me, as burger places can often disappoint, and I'd probably give it five stars if it weren't for the high prices.  Oh, and I should remark that the beer selection here was enviable. Great selection of international bottles, plus Fat Tire on draft. Fat Tire, son.",

May be most peeps were sleeping in from a night of partying? ;)  I almost almost ordered the grilled chicken burger since I'm trying to watch what I eat since I'm getting married in June, but OMG, I'm so glad I \"wised up\" and ordered the Kobe burger!!!   It was the best burger I've ever had to date.  I ordered my burger medium with aioli and grilled onions on a wheat bun. It was cooked to perfection. I didn't order any fries, so I \"stole\" skinny fries from my df - boy, they were quite good! Just the way I like them. Service was attentive and friendly.   Our server really was on top of things.    My df and FBIL ordered the buffalo burger, they said it was very good though my df thought his burger could've been cooked a little more (he ordered medium but it looked medium rare).  My FSIL (Christine T. ) ordered the kobe beef burger also, but she ordered it medium rare. She said she should've ordered it medium instead.  Must get the chocolate burger!!  The four of us shared it and it was just enough for a taste.  If I'm craving a burger, I'm going to hit up the San Francisco location - hopefully, it's just as good!",

    "text": "I had the pleasure of dining here a few months ago with my girlfriend and don't regret it one bit. These guys are one of the first restaurants in town to make gourmet and specialty burgers a cornerstone of their business so their pioneering efforts alone make them worthy of your business... in my opinion. The decor is rather nondescript, but the beer selection is noteworthy.   I decided to try the buffalo burger medium, on an onion bun with shitake mushrooms and blue cheese crumble.  It was pretty fantastic and easily one of the burgers I have ever had. It was rich and flavorful without being excessively greasy. The steak fries were solid. My girlfriend opted for the turkey burger with fresh made guacamole which was good, but I really wouldn't recommend it unless you have a strict diet or avoid red meat for religious reasons. The bottom line is that there are many different kinds of burgers here for the various tastes and preferences of burger lovers Prices were ok considering this is located in Mandalay bay and has garnered quite a bit of attention over the years. In my opinion this is THE place to go for a burger if you are in Mandalay Bay--without question.",

Yeah I said it, a burger orgasm that you can't get from eating a Big Mac or In-n-Out burger, but right here, right now, Burger Bar.  Can I get an angus burger on a sesame bun with chopped jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, a fried egg (over-easy!), grilled onions, and chipotle aioli sauce? YES, I CAN! My creation was so amazing with the right amount of spices and flavors mixed so well together with the thickness of the angus beef. To be honest, the fried egg really did it for me... you cannot go wrong with that!!! My only suggestion is to pass on the $5 beer battered pickles: NOT WORTH IT...trust me. (The fat fries were also alright). What IS worth it is the +$15 you will spend on one burger that will leave you wondering how'd a burger make you feel so completely satisfied?! & if the cost is what's stopping you from coming here, bet $20 on black at the roulette tables and cross your fingers for a win that'll be spent on something you won't regret!!",

I must say I was expecting my server to show of their tummies and for them to look like they had a good time at a bar. So I was really crossed on what kind of burger to get and I ended up getting the classic Hubert Keller burger....I must say it was a very strange tasted. I ended up taking only a couple of bits and putting it down. I tried my friend's Burgers and they tasted great. For a restaurant that focus' on burgers I was definitely disappointed. It lacked a lot of good mixtures of flavor. The fries were ok too. The sauces that they gave you were good. The servers were pleasant and nice. They were accommodation especially when the burger came out to be the wrong temperature. You would think they would have it down because it is a burger bar. I guess everyone has their slip once in a while. None the less, they were very nice about it and the manager gave him a whole new plate.",

We both had the Buffalo Burger with bleu cheese (you can get a Chef's burger or \"build your own\").  I had a toasted sesame seed bun and my brother had the toasted plain bun.  I have to say that it was a REALLY tasty burger.  The other ingredients (lettuce, red onion, and tomato) were unremarkable but let the meat stand out.  The Skinny fries were unremarkable but I did find myself nibbling at my brother's sweet potato fries which I actually liked better than the Skinny fries (and I don't normally prefer sweet potato fries).  We were seated immediately (didn't like our table and were shown to a booth without hesitation by the hostess) and our server appeared right away to take our drink orders (lots of beer to choose from).  Drinks arrived quickly and our orders were taken efficiently and all of our menu questions were answered cheerfully with enough detail for us to decide.  The servers all around seemed like they like to work there; she checked on us peridocially but didn't seem intrusive.  The place had the up-beat vibe of a sports bar (screens all over the place including a small flat-panel in our booth) and the buzz that comes with a lot of tourists--it's Vegas, after all--oh, and there were a couple of crying kids but we were too into our food so they were drowned out plus it's so big, asking to be moved should not be a problem.  I would like to go back, or maybe hit the Burger Bar in my hometown, to try the Rossini burger: for $60.00 you get Kobe beef, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, Madeira sauce, on onion bun.",

The zucchini fries were delicious and amazing - hot with a crispy coating.  As Oklahomans, where decent beer cannot even enter the borders, we appreciated the extensive and tasty small brewery beer selection.  Day Two:  Hubs - same as Day One (not so adventuresome, or maybe he just really liked it), Black and White milkshake (vanilla ice cream, cookie dough, chocolate whipped cream) Me - black angus with proscuitto and mozzarella cheese, zuc. fries,  custom milkshake with vanilla ice cream, oreos, and caramel sauce.    I rarely, and by that I mean almost never, eat to the point of pain.  The milkshake was worth it.  In fact, I was tempted to keep eating it despite feeling like I just might throw up from fullness.   We enjoyed everything we ate, had good service, and found the quality for price point to be high given the crappy overpriced offerings in the casinos.",

I had actually thought it was inside Mandalay Bay... I didnt know 'Mandalay Place' existed (Its a interior corridor between Luxor, where we stayed, and Mandalay Bay with restaurants and shops). I was looking forward to building a juicy burger and adding some toppings with a little extra heat and flavor in them and devouring it with some sweet potato fries.  We were seated... hostess was nice... I guess. The crowd was a little obnoxious and the waitresses seemed a little prude (in their short shorts, small tops, and platform boots).. and this was lunch time. We had about 4-5 minutes of looking over the menu when a gentl... guy came over (not sure if he was our waiter or busser.. he had a full lenth apron on). He didnt introduce himself as our waiter, didnt ask if we had been there before, didnt go over anything on the menu... just took our drink orders... Well, he did bring those back... and left again! This had been at least 10 minutes since we plopped our buns in the booth ( with a tv showing sports... news) The dude made no mention still if he was our waiter or not, just dropped off the drinks and left. Still didnt ask us if we've had time to go over the menu, or if we had any questions. Meh, it was already past the point of no return... I could tell already what the service was going to be like. We had seen other tables being serviced, and plenty of other employees walking past us... we were close to the rear/kitchen, probably noticing we hadnt really been helped, but kept on moving (like I said, I thought this place was a little.... ya know).  So 15 minutes, Im sure had past. My fiancee and I looked at each other, knew what one was thinking, got up, and left.  I swear I heard our dude holler across the restaurant, \"Hey guys come back\". Maybe that's what I wanted to hear so I could turn his way and....  Oh how I wanted a burger from here... Maybe next time. For now, One Star",

The combination of spicy ketchup, perfect medium rare lamb, so thick my wife had trouble taking a bite, and the soft ciabatta bun (most places have ciabatta that's too crunchy for me), made for a wonderful lunch. The fries were done well, but not superior to other fries I've had. I was so full from the burger that I forgot to order a Nutella shake for desert. Our bartender was friendly, we talked Halloween costumes (my wife had just picked up a sailor outfit and tutu at Frederick's, right across the way from Burger Bar). My only complaint is that I had asked for a Coca-Cola, the only have Pepsi, so I ordered a Sprite and was brought... a Pepsi. Barely a complaint at all, I didn't bother correcting the order, but a tiny bit irritating. The food came exactly as ordered however, so it was a good experience overall.",

And you reside here, so very far away from me. ::Single tear:: This was the last place I ate during my first trek to Sin City, and what a way to end the trip. The menu is fantastically huge, with all kinds of goodies to pile onto your Burger. And when I say \"your burger\", it truly becomes YOUR burger, because you make it what you want. Care for some chipotle aioli? Go for it. More of a grilled onion person? Be my guest? Oh, no, you say you want CARAMELIZED onions instead? They have those too! I mean, portabellos, spinach, fried egg, bacon.... peanut butter?? So many different reason I need to get back there. It's a shame that my tummy and pain threshold are not as strong as I would like them to be, otherwise I would have added one of the yummy-sounding milkshakes to my order as well. What's so special about a milkshake? Well, the fact that they have a list of shakes with alcohol in them is pretty friggin' special to me, so back off. :) Perfectly done, medium Angus beef with Swiss cheese, sprouts, avocado, mushrooms and aioli.... this is called \"The Ali\".... at least in my head. Oh. Em. Gee. Love love LOVE on a bun. Do it. You know you want to!",

    "text": "A concept table service burger joint plus full bar in the shopping zone of Mandalay Place, from chef Hubert Keller of Fleur-de-Lys fame.  The concept is that you choose a base burger (3 kinds of beef, lamb, turkey, garden, etc), one of five buns, and then pile on your choice of about 40 toppings at extra cost, ranging from homemade beet pickles to a half lobster or a fried egg.  The $60 Rossini burger (with foie gras, sliced black truffles, and madeira sauce) is something to try at least once and the $16 regular Kobe burger is good too.  Knowledgeable and courteous waitstaff, great ingredients.  A real temple of burger-dom.  Only two reason for four stars instead of five are: 1) bar concept though ineeds work and better mixed drinks (but does have 24 beers on tap); and 2) prices a little high, and really, after all that it's still a hamburger.",

The american kobe isn't the cheapest option on the menu but it is worth every penny. the toppings take up a nice piece of real estate on the menu and have almost anything you would want on a burger, even a lobster tail to turn your burger to the surf and turf. amazing place and hot hot hot bartenders.",

Thanks for all of the tips from everyone. I ended up getting the Kobe burger with pepper jack cheese, avocado, grilled onion, jalapeno bacon with Truffle Mayo. OMG- this was the best burger I have ever had.   I also had the skinny fries and ordered the sauce sampler (5 choices) with: Basil Aioli, Truffle mayo, White BBQ Sauce, Spicy Ketchup and Chipotle Aioli. Let me tell you that they were all very good sauces. But that Truffle Mayo is so good I think I could just drink it out of a glass. Not a joke!   I also ordered the Beer Sampler of course. I can't remember all of the names of beer that I got, except I did get Stella Artois, and the Sin City beer.  This was really cool and I loved all of the beer I chose.  Everyone at my table loved this experience. We would have stayed for dessert but our waiter the snob seemed like he wanted us to leave. So that is exactly what we did. So much for my Nutella Milkshake and Chocolate Burger. Maybe next time.",

The side booth we were sested in had a TV inside the wall so if you don't want to talk to your dining companions there's always that haha! I forgot what the exact name of our appetizer was but the way our waitress explained it made it seem totally different than what I was expecting. It basically tasted like a jalapeno popper that came with a side of garlic aioli. The size was really small though.   I ended up ordering the baguette burger and added jalapeno bacon. It's served on what looks like a metal cafeteria lunch tray which I thought was cute and unique. My burger wasn't bad but it wasn't great. The jalapeno bacon was chewy and it didn't taste any different than regular bacon. The baguette was also a bit tough, making it hard to eat. The side of skinny fries  tasted average but there was definitely a lot of them! The best part was how perfectly the meat was cooked. My boyfriend and I both got ours medium and both were cooked just right. I swear my boyfriend ate his in about 10 min because he didn't want to put it down!   What makes a burger for me is mostly the toppings, which this one didn't have much of. But if you're all about the meat then I'm sure you'll enjoy this place!",

    "text": "I can't believe I waited so long to try Burger Bar.  But then again anything worth having is worth waiting for.  This Hubert Keller establishment is less expensive than his other restaurants.  Since, I enjoyed his Fleur burger when I went to Fleur a few months ago, I had to get a similar burger at Burger Bar.  An old friend raves about the Nutella milkshake and he knows how much I love Nutella so eventhough I'm lactose intolerant, I had to get a Nutella milkshake.   It came before my meal came so I was basically having dessert before entree - and there's absolutely nothing wrong with that.  I was instantly addicted to it.  My friend had to pry it from my tiger claws.  It's a chocolate and Nutella milkshake with chocolate whipped cream topped with whole hazelnuts.  Definitely the best milkshake ever!!!  I got the Rossini burger (Kobe beef, foie gras and black truffles on onion bun) with Skinny Truffle fries.  It's $60 but you have to consider the fact that you're getting the best burger you could ever have plus, it includes fries and dessert!  Fleur charges the same price for  the same burger but your dessert won't be free!  So, for what you're getting, it's definitely worth the price.  The friend copied what I got except he had Fat Truffle fries.  The Skinny and the Fat fries were equally good.    The free dessert that came with our Rossini burgers, we got a white burger and a chocolate burger.  The white burger has cheesecake with fruits on a Krispy Kreme doughnut.  The chocolate burger has a Nutella fudge \"patty\" with passion fruit gelee \"cheese\", kiwi and strawberries.  They were good but I'm biased towards anything with Nutella so the chocolate burger was a clear favorite.  The service was excellent as well.  Our server Gina checked on us from time to time.  She remembered having a Yelp event there a month ago.  It was an awesome first experience for me and I want more Nutella milkshake!!!",

    "text": "Burger Bar is On-The-Strip-Dining, with that being said, it's really one of the better dining options to consider when you're on the south end of the Vegas Strip. The burgers are decent, and the prices are fairly reasonable.   FOOD The burger choices on the menu appeal to a variety of tastes. There's also the option to create your own burger masterpiece with an array of condiments, buns, and patties if none of the menu choices don't appeal to your belly.   On my last visit, I kept it simple and ordered the American Classic  (AC). The AC is a basic cheeseburger with onions, lettuce, tomatoes, a pickle, and bacon. It also comes with a good amount of crispy skinny fries. I ordered my burger to be cooked at medium-rare, but it was just too rare for my preference -- medium-well might be a better option.   SERVICE I've been here on a number of different occasions, and this place is always packed. When I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, before dinnertime, the restaurant was already filled with diners. You can choose to ride those hunger pangs and wait for a table, or grab an empty spot at the bar be served immediately. The bar service is fine, but I would've preferred sitting at a booth or table.  OTHER The restrooms are located outside of the restaurant, and it's kind of a long trek just to get there no matter if you exit the restaurant from the front or back.  OVERALL A decent dining choice located inside The Mandalay Bay, but I would check if it's possible to make a reservation in advance.",

Over a hundred bottled beers to choose from as well. I settled on a Victory IPA from Hop Devil brewery, a tasty adult beverage for sure! Nice and lip puckering bitter with a taste of German malts rounding out at 6.7abv.    Now for food, ordering a burger was a no brainer. After all the place is called burger bar right? I went for the \"Perfect 10\", a huge free range beef patty that was BBQ marinated and perfectly cooked with smoked gouda cheese and caramelized onions served on a pretzel bun. YUMMY!  Man this one hit the spot like a cannon! Highly recommended.  The burgers are pretty pricey but they come with a good portion of tasty shoestring french fries and this is Vegas...    Burgers and beer, gotta love it.",

We made the mistake of dining at Holstein's, which I absolutely loved the first time we visited last year.   What makes Burger Bar a 4 star dining experience for us is actually overlooked quite often by Yelpers like me. I have been to Burger Bar in Vegas 3 times, SF 5 times and both locations offer exactly the same quality, the same freshness, flavors are identical each and every time. Consistency is clearly the end result of hard work, dedication and a high level of execution.   I decided to add some additional options to my burger this go around and I am glad I do. I typically order up the same things, but this time, I added grilled onions, which were cooked to perfection and tasted delicious atop my burger.   I also ordered up a Virgin strawberry mojito and damn was it good!  I think I just wanted to give Hubert and his team another 4 star review to remind them that their dedication is noticed and that I love em, even if we have to visit this particular hotel to see them.",

Each time that I have gone, we were seated right again, but then again both times were on weekdays when it tends to be less busy. Overall, I like being able to sit at a booth because of the comfort level, as well as the tiny tv on the wall that allows you to catch up on the latest sports scores, news, etc. I like that at Burger Bar you can create and customize your own burger instead of picking a burger and asking for them to take off ingredients you don't like. At my last visit, I decided to go big or go home and went with the Kobe burger on a sesame bun. Alongside with it I had to go with some pepper jack cheese, as well as BACON! Anyone that knows me knows that if bacon is on the menu, 9 out of 10 times I will order it jeje and this time was no different. Last but not least, I had to get some truffle fries to go along with my customized burger. The burger was super juicy and the meat was cooked perfectly. Can't wait to go back!",

I know burger joints aren't known for vegetarian burgers, and frankly most places just throw some sort of dry black bean patty on the menu and call it a vegetarian option, but I find it refreshing when burger places have multiple vegetarian options for their patrons. That being said, the Burger Bar had a decent vegetarian patty on their menu. It was comprised of unique ingredients like peas and potatoes, it was soft and moist and although I felt like my patty needed some salt, it masked by the ingredients within my burger.   My $9.95 vegetarian burger included a leaf of romaine lettuce, a slice of tomato and a slice of onion. Everything else is extra!! Cheese: 0.95, avocado: 1.75, aioli: 0.75. I also ordered a side of sweet potato fries for 3.65 and paid an extra 0.75 for aioli with my fries. I paid about $24 for a vegetarian burger and a side of fries with tax and tip.  I'm all for paying for great food and exceptional service, but I hate over paying for mediocre food and okay service. I feel like Hubert Keller nickel and dimed me for a lackluster burger and I'm not pleased.  I wouldn't come back.",

    "text": "As we were contemplating on what and where to eat for dinner on Friday, my BIL suggested this place.  It's located in Mandalay Place (the mall between Mandalay Bay and Luxor).  We arrived around 6:00ish and had to wait about 25 minutes (party of 8 here), which wasn't too bad since we spent most of that time checking out the candies in Lick (a colorful candy store nearby).  The concept of building your own burger is fun, but can get pricey.  I got the naturesource patty on a sesame bun ($10.50) + pepper jack cheese ($0.95) + grilled onions ($0.95) + peppers ($0.95) + chipotle aioli ($0.45) = $13.80 (lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and dill pickle already included).  Not too bad price wise, but that's for a burger only.  One of my kids (who eats like a horse) wanted a burger that included grilled shrimp ($6.00) + a side of mozzarella sticks ($5.95) that would've cost $25 to which I said HELLL NOOO (she only took out the shrimp so it still was about $20).  My burger was pretty good.  The patty was nicely pink (medium well) and juicy with a kick from the pepper jack cheese and chipotle aioli.  It was also pretty filling too, so I didn't need a side after all (because I stole some mozzarella sticks, skinny fries, fat fries, zucchini fries, and pepper jack cheese shots from others...needless to say, I couldn't finish my burger).  Maybe next time I'll try their $60 burger.  HAHAHAHAHA.",

    "text": "Burger Bar has a great name.  Who doesn't enjoy a good beer to go along with a good burger?  They have the variety of toppings and selection of beer to deserve their name.  Yet I don't think their food deserves their prices.  I had the Kobe Burger and topped it with japaleno bacon, carmelized onions, and got their black truffle sauce on the side.  With the price of my burger now above $20, I expected heaven on an onion bun.  When the food was brought out, my heart sank.    One of my burger pet peeves is when the bun is bigger than the patty.  If I'm paying this much for a burger, it's disappointing when 25% of the burger was all bun and no meat.  Perhaps the cost and size is offset by the quality of the beef?  After all, the menu states, \"This American Kobe Beef from Snake River melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate.\"    Unfortunately I agree with only half of that.  It was a very tender burger; they're not too far off by saying it melts in your mouth.  But unmatched flavor?  When I was asked how the burger tasted, my only reply was, \"It's really tender.\"  Sadly, the unmatched flavor was nowhere to be found.  I didn't use the truffle sauce at all for the first half; after that I was pouring that sauce all over in an effort to give the burger flavor.  In the end I'm suspecting that is was an off day, since many people have enjoyed the Kobe burger during their visits.  But based on this first experience, I can't see myself coming back anytime soon.",

I was surprised they actually have barely any pre-concocted burgers, but actually base their menu on build-your-own burgers, which I didn't like. I want what the \"house specialty\" is, but wasn't impressed by their list of standbys. Also, by making all the toppings ala carte, you can really inflate your check.   I ordered the organic beef burger, which after cooked to my preference of medium well it could have been from a Kroger beef log and I wouldn't have known. So, it wasn't amazing beef. After my losing streak downtown the night before, no Kobe for me! Like I mentioned, the highlight of the sandwich was the jalapeno bacon where they cure the bacon in pickled jalapeno juice according the the waitress. The fried egg was cooked over medium when it was stated over easy. Bummer. Ala carte Sweet potato fries can be passed on. When one of my table mates ordered cheese fries, they actually just melt 3 slices of cheese onto your fries and then charge you for each slice of cheese. Hilarious!!! Fat Tire on tap made the boys happy. Iced tea was fresh and refreshing!  I liked the rock decor and rock themed wait staff. Our service was good. By Monday at 12:30 There was already a wait so, you know it's popular. I'd definitely be back if I'm down at the South end of the Strip or staying at Mandalay, but I'm not making a special trip out. I mean, it's just burgers.",

Huge beer selection (which I appreciate). You can build your own burger or choose from one of the gourmet ones. I built my own and loved it. I tried 5 different beers, too. If you love burgers ( or just feel like having one), this is a place to go in LV. Highly recommend and look forward to trying HK more upscale restaurants",

From Kobe, Angus, Veggie and even Buffalo, the burger combinations are endless.  This is a build your own burger establishment and there are a plethora of toppings to choose from.  Too many mind boggling choices.  I could have used a few \"favorite\" combinations from the menu.  It's easy to get confused with all the possibilities.    The sides were good too.  They have skinny fries, which I love (and I think fat fries too...but who wants those?) and the onion rings were awesome.  Hubby had the sweet potato fries which he thoroughly enjoyed.  By the time it was all said and done we were gorged on all  that burgery goodness.  The service was friendly and fast, but not so fast they are rushing you out.  Oh, and they had little flat screen TVs in all the booths if you are interested in sports.      My only regret is that I didn't try a donut made to look a burger dessert.  Because I think we need to incorporate donuts into more than just a breakfast treat.",

There was a mini tv screen in the booth which was cool. Our waitress was very nice and cool throughout our time there.  I ordered the kobe burger (australian wagyu $17) with cheddar cheese and button mushrooms and a sesame bun (cheese and toppings are at an additional cost. ) Also a side of sweet potato fries. The burger was great. I ordered it a medium well and they couldn't have made it more perfect. My only complaint is I like my burgers a little on the greasy side and there was virtually no grease in my burger at all but I'd imagine that is a good thing for most normal people!! Sweet potato fries were really really addicting!!!   For the price and the quality of meat, I thought it was a good deal!! I would definitely go back!!",

This place doesn't hold a candle to East Coast burger places like Z Burger and 5 guys. Want an overprice burger that doesn't have much to offer, come here. Want to say after your meal, jeez I wish I would have just went through the drive through at McDonalds, come here. I came here with a friend and we both ordered 2 dressed up burgers with a side of fries and a coke, the price was close to $60. The burgers were overcooked when we asked for medium. The fries tasted like they had come out of a bag in the frozen food section and then been deep fat fried when they were put on our plates there was an excess amount of oil. The only part of the meal they excelled in was the cokes, but how hard is it to put together a fountain soda these days.  Not coming back.....",

I'm a carnivore myself and  what carnivore wouldn't love a burger late at night? He ordered his $60 burger and I tried another burger.   Needless to say, I was disappointed with my burger...The ground beef had several little pieces of nerves in it, yuck, I could not enjoy my burger. I took a bite out of the $60 burger and so worth the price. We ended up telling the waitress about my burger, she apologized and explained that the ground beef was made fresh daily and it tends to happen. I do not know if that's a good or bad thing?! Fresh ground beef but with little pieces of nerves, hmmmm?! We did get 50% off my burger but I would have rather paid full price for a delicious burger I would have enjoyed to the last bite.   Oh well, I might give this place another try next time I'm in town but that's a big might. The ambiance was cool, casual, they had a bar, and tvs. The night we we went it was pretty empty for a Saturday night in Vegas, weird. But give it a shot and you might just like it!",

The beef was fantastic, but the toppings were actually pretty bad. The avocado was under-ripe and the bacon was way overcooked. It was like a beautiful Italian sports car with a bunch of stupid bumper stickers on it (think \"COEXIST\" and Calvin peeing on something); a tremendous foundation with garnishes that only subtract.  The sweet potato fries, while tasty, were lukewarm and kind of soggy. Not the best I've had, to be sure.  The Nutella Shake, however, is worth all the hype and more. It was so rich and amazing that I'd come back here just for that. Too bad it's a four hour flight...  I'd give Burger Bar another try next time I'm in Vegas, but I'm disappointed I didn't have the experience everyone else on Yelp seems to have had.",

I wanted to grab it and shriek 'my precious' and claw at anyone thinking of touching my glorious glass of sugary goodness.  Get this dang shake.   You will thank me  I would give a five star on the shake alone but it IS a BURGER bar after all.

    "text": "I still have a handful of places to try, but this is probably my favorite burger place in Las Vegas. There's a set menu of burgers, but you can still customize your burger if you want. There is a varied selection of proteins for your burger, the sides are solid, the beer list is lengthy, and you can customize a shake or sundae for dessert. It's usually busy and on a wait, so service is usually relevant to the time you dine.  Our party of five came when they lifted the gate at 11 AM on Mother's Day. We had a reservation via Open Table, but didn't need it. The restaurant though was at capacity by the time we left. We sat in one of the booths which are each equipped with their own television. Service was sufficient as our server wasn't too busy. The kitchen was timely most likely for the same reason. Their efficiency also included the food runner, who was aware of seat numbers and brought the food to each of us describing the dish without having to inquire who ordered it.  I've had the Austarlian Wagyu burger on my last visit and it was delicious and quite memorable. This time, I ordered the Hubert Keller Burger ($24.85) which they were able to keep the lean buffalo meat juicy. The portion of blue cheese wasn't too large and overpowering and the red wine shallot reduction added to the depth of flavor with an acidic note. The skinny fries were hot with crispy exterior crunch. I did miss on the beer pairing as my Firestone Union Jack IPA was a little too high in the IBU units. That's my bad and I'll get it right next time. Also ordered was an angus burger, a turkey burger, the burger bar sliders, and a chicken caesar salad. I had a bite of my wife's angus burger and it was still juicy even though she ordered it well done (she should be punished accordingly for ordering her burger at that temp). Next time, I'll have to try the lamb.  Pricing is expected for a gourmet burger joint on the Strip with alcohol ordered. Before tip, our bill was $133. If the third visit is as good as my first two, then I'll have to put Burger Bar at the top of the list.",

Everything was ok hostess were nice and our server is ok I guess. The issue was with my order I req no pickles, when the food came everything looks good when I cut into the burger in half ate it I was ok then start finishing the half and in the middle of it I was like it kinda taste bland so when I finish it because I was so hungry I said wait there's no dressing no tomato no lettuce no onion just the extra cheese I added. Called the server and ask does my burger comes with anything else like lettuce or something she was like YES IT SHOULD BE ON THE didnt it came with it? (And I was like nope) and then she said oh sorry my bad I THOUGHT U SAID NOTHING ON IT and I told her the only thing I said is NO PICKLES. And then after having our food she came to ask if we need anything else my friend said the mayo that she initially asked upon ordering and when she was done with her burger and when the server came she was like oh your mayo didn't came and we were like just horrible.

Hangover Burger: Angus beef smothered in their Hangover Sauce (Thousand Island and Chopped Lettuce), with onions and ketchup on a sesame bun. Also added an egg over easy to the burger. Ordered it medium, but definitively came medium-well. The sauce was fine, but the burger wasn't all that special.  S'mores Milkshake: Highlight of the meal, and would go back just for the shake. Chocolate fudge on the inside of the glass, two graham crackers, marshmallow cream, and ice cream! The only improvement would be to serve it in the glass, with the extras in a stainless steel The only improvement would be to serve the remaining milkshake in a steel mixing cup with a long spoon. The Milkshake moves my overall ranking from a 3 to a 4.",

They also have a variety of healthy options. Whatever you do, get any of their fries and try them with any of their aioli sauces. The garlic aioli was so good with my fries and went well with my burger as I am not a ketchup gal.   Service - it was nook on a Sunday and it was barely half filled up. Service was way slow and it took even longer to get our food. Waiters were nice though.  In all, wouldn't go out of my way for Burger Bar but if I were staying at the Mandalay Bay or any of the conjoining hotels, I'd probably stop by again.",

(Atypical I know'!) i ordered the burger sliders accompanied by skinny fries and a glass of chardonnay. The burgers were made medium-rare and I asked for a side of the garlic aoli for the fries. The burgers were made well but pretty skimpy on the dressing; they came with a tiny 1'x1' pale piece of green with an anemic tiny slice of tomato. One of them had about the same size piece of bacon. Another has a small mushy pile of supposedly carmelized onions and the third had barely any cheese. All for $15! The wine was good but was also miniature sized. It was not a white wine glass but resembled a cordial glass, for $9! Honestly, I could get twice the food and drink for that price, even at a tourist trap on the strip!",

My order was the following: - Skinny Fries: Delicious - Onion Rings: Delicious - Caramel Milkshake: Amazing - Chef's Veggie Burger: I was a bit disappointed with this burger.  I was very excited as I took my first bite.  But realized that there was absolutely no salt.  The burger was very bland.  I had to put some spicy sauce on it to get some flavor.  I couldn't even finish half of it.  So as a vegetarian, I was disappointed.  But I am sure the other burgers are amazing (as per my friends).",

There are plenty of different options here that you would find at your regular burger place plus a few added extras.  My boyfriend got the kobe burger and really liked it.  I wasn't too hungry so I opted for a fry sampler to split with him (the fries were good but I mostly munched on the fried pickles of the one we ordered) and I built my own milkshake.  I have never tasted a milkshake so amazing before.  I dream about returning to vegas and enjoying another strawberry chocolate shake.    If you're in the area, definitely check out Burger Bar.

    "text": "The debate between trying Gordon Ramsay's Burgr joint or Burger Bar was quite the decision to make. I guess the decision was made: Hello, Burger Bar.   The price range is hefty for a burger, but when you're in vegas--it doesn't hurt to splurge a little. My first choice was the Hubert Keller at the price of $25 & comes with a side of skinny fries. I've never had buffalo meat and cooked at medium--it was delicious. Never been a fan of blue cheese, so subbed that out for provolone. I am a True provolone cheese lover, but man oh man--it really overpowered the taste of the burger. As a matter of fact, it's sad to say that it was a bit too much cheese for me. Personal suggestion? Ask for light cheese with any burger. Oh yes, & the french fries? Nothing special about the fries.   I can't say this was the best burger I've ever had aka still on the hunt for it. But it's never a bad idea to expand your broad of taste & check it off your list of places you've eaten at. Better to try than wonder \"what if\", am I right?   Also, don't say I didn't warn you but prepare for a long wait for your food. It was at least a 20-30 minute wait for our food to finally come out. So just make sure you're not absolutely starving walking in here otherwise you might get pretty hangry.   Eat on.",

Overall good burger. The meat needed a little bit more seasoning (had to dip in ketchup for a little extra flavor). A great burger for me, does not require ketchup. I really enjoyed having turkey bacon as an option. Had an Australian ginger beer with lime on the side.  Note: The staff was awesome!",

The burger was smaller than I imagined a $15 burger would be, but paired with the fries, it was the perfect amount of food to split if you're trying to go \"light\" for lunch or dinner.   Our waitress was super helpful and had the burger cut for us and kept it on one plate rather than charging us the $2 \"splitting\" charge.  The sweet potato fries were fabulous! Added bonus: $6 draught beer! Way cheaper than the $13 beers at all the hotels.  Would definitely go back!",

For apps we ordered fried zucchini and fried pickles, as well as a sauce sampler. The fried pickles were spears and I'm used to the little chips. The zucchini, which I have never had, was actually pretty tasty! The pickle spears were ok, I don't like spears because I feel they don't get cooked enough, but they sufficed. The sauces we tried were chipotle aioli, tartar sauce, spicy ketchup, basil aioli, and I think the white bbq. The chipotle aioli is the clear winner! It was soooooo good! I dipped everything in that sauce, it made the pickles so much better! The basil aioli was also tasty.  For our burgers we both selected the Angus Beef and medium. I ordered mine on ciabatta, with jalapenos, avocado, Swiss, and jalapeno bacon. He went with a sesame bun, cheddar, Foie Gras, fried egg, and opted for the black perigord truffle sauce and the red wine and shallot reduction sauces.  My burger look most excellent, I love a burger on ciabatta because of the juices from the burger, it was so lovely and pretty! The taste was delicious; the beef was perfect with a pink center! You can tell the beef is fresh! The avocado was also fresh and green! The jalapeno bacon wasn't over powering nor was the actual jalapenos. Included were the pickled jalapenos and fresh. I also got the skinny fries which were a perfect addition! He said his burger was AMAZING. He literally finished it before I finished half of my half lol. He gave me a try of the Foie, and I was not a fan. He said it was perfect though, for $13 I would sure hope so! The egg was cooked perfectly as well, like a soft fried.  Our customer service here was impeccable, the server checked on us many times and offered her feedback on the food and asked how everything was! She made sure we always had our drinks refilled. It was nice!  We will def be back for more yummies!!  Yay!",

    "text": "Staying at Mandalay Bay, and anytime I checked Yelp! for recos, Burger Bar popped up. Luckily, we got an opportunity to walk over (short walk through the mall-like part of the hotel that connects to the Luxor) and have dinner here. What a great call!  Happy hour: strawberry mojito ($6; I would have ordered one after the other if someone else was buying them for me... they were that good), Pilsner ($3). Burger: angus beef, medium rare, caramelized onions, pepper jack cheese, jalepeno bacon, hangover sauce (in-house special sauce), avocado on a ciabatta bun. Eff yeah. Meat came out PERFECTLY medium rare. Can I just say how obsessed I immediately became over the jalapeno bacon?? Jesus is real. And I know this because of how amazing the jalapeno bacon was on that burger. Everything worked perfectly together and the combo with the Pilsner hit the spot.   We were a party of 5, and the wait for a table would have been about 45 minutes (Sunday evening). There was plenty of room at the bar, however, so we made our way there and took advantage of the last few minutes of the Happy Hour menu.   The fries and chicken strips from the Happy Hour menu came our within minutes. Your standard fries and chicken strips: tasty, not anything brilliant.   The burgers took a little longer. Probably waited a solid 20 minutes, which felt like 45 because of how hungry we were, but for the perfection of my meal, I'll take it without complaint.   The rest of the burgers looked good, and we all pretty much finished our plates.   I really enjoyed being able to build my own burger, and the options were crazy good, from truffles (right?!), to caramelized onions, fresh avocado to any kind of cheese.   Love the big TVs for watching games at the bar area.",

It had a great flavor and the baguette gave a perfect crunch (I love crispy bread). The skinny fries while they were tasty did not really wow me as much as I expected (especially after reading other reviews). They were cooked well but weren't as crispy as I thought they would be.

The meat itself was nothing special and even kind of bland. They offer a good number of toppings that you can add on, but charge $1+ for each. The fries were standard and my girlfriend was unsatisfied with her fried zucchini.  The service was a little lacking, however, it was noon and close to full capacity. I feel that our waitress didn't prioritize our table because we had a big group and her 18% tip was already guaranteed. I would not come back here in the future.",

    "text": "***Many Las Vegas restaurants let their quality standards slip once they have been around for a while and that is the case with Hubert Keller's Burger Bar; Burger Bar is still a decent value compared to the many overpriced high-end restaurants on The Strip, but there are several new gourmet burger spots in Vegas (like Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood) that are probably more exciting***  There are several reasons to visit Hubert Keller's Burger Bar.  It is from a celebrity chef (Hubert Keller), but it is a relatively inexpensive restaurant (at least compared to the many expensive celebrity chef backed fine dining restaurants on The Strip).  It also primarily features two items--burgers and milkshakes--that are very popular.  Finally, Hubert Keller was on Top Chef Masters and showcased this restaurant as well as his burger skills so many might be intrigued with this one if they saw that season of Top Chef Masters on the Food Network.  This Burger Bar (there is also one located in the Macy's in San Francisco) is housed in Mandalay Place--a mini-mall within Mandalay Bay that features a few retail and dining options.  It is a fairly small place and the menu showcases a build-your-own-burger concept where you pick your burger protein--several types of beef, lamb, buffalo, turkey, and veggie as well as chicken breast and salmon.  You then choose your desired bun as well as all kinds of toppings including raw vegetables, grilled vegetables, many types of cheese (standard stuff like American and cheddar but also brie and smoked Gouda), several sauces, additional proteins like bacon and prosciutto, and finally a few premium ingredients like seared foie gras and black truffle.  You can also order one of their signature chef's burger creations so you do not have to make any choices.  In addition to their burgers, Burger Bar also serves all kinds of fried food from French fries and onion rings to zucchini fries and mozzarella sticks.  Chicken wings and a few salads are available too.  I went the build-your-own-burger route and opted for their Prime ground beef and added bacon, smoked Gouda and spinach on a potato bun.  The burger was okay.  I thought the burger at the newer Gordon Ramsay BurGR was much better--the beef was much juicier there and it featured both a higher quality bun as well as higher quality toppings.  The burger at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar was okay, but only the really thick and meaty (crispy but also chewy) bacon stood out.  The bun felt very plain for a gourmet burger spot.  I also opted for one of their milkshakes.  They have all kinds of milkshakes from build-your-own-milkshakes with many toppings to signature creations.  I tried their caramel latte, which featured coffee ice cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels.  It was a great mix of caramel and coffee and the milkshake had a great thick and creamy consistency (very addictive and hard to put down).  Service was good--pleasant and quick.  Prices are reasonable for a notable Las Vegas restaurant.  Burger Bar's prices are higher than similar gourmet burger restaurants in other big cities like Los Angeles, but that is to be expected given that Burger Bar is on The Strip.  Burger Bar does offer a decent meal that comes at a much lower price than the many celebrity chef backed (and very pricey) fine dining restaurants on The Strip.  I remember liking Burger Bar more on my first trip.  It is not too surprising that the quality has dropped since then; the quality standards at many Vegas restaurants seem to slip if it has been around for a long time.  Hubert Keller's Burger Bar is still a decent spot, but Gordon Ramsay BurGR at Planet Hollywood is a much better option for an gourmet burger on The Strip.  Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is attached to Mandalay Bay.  Like other major casinos and hotels on The Strip, Mandalay Bay offers both complimentary self and valet parking.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Burger Bar last weekend for the infamous Rossini. Everything was great from the service to the burger (and the dessert burger that followed).  The Rossini was great - rich and juicy. The fries were just you basic boring fries (the only disappointment of the meal). I chose the cheesecake version of the dessert burger and it was fantastic. I'm not a dessert fan but I ate every bite of it. The fresh strawberries made it.  Would I stop in here every trip and spend 60.00 on a burger - no. Was it delicious and am I glad I did it - yes.",

    "text": "Burger Bar: You had me at FOIE GRAS and BLACK TRUFFLES  This is a great place for quality burgers. You can choose from one of the many different burgers on the menu or build your own. They have a ton of beers on tap,and a bunch of neat cocktails. I tried the Salted Caramel martini. Definitely very strong, but perhaps a little TOO salty for my taste.   We tried a few burgers when we came in this weekend.  I ordered a Grilled Chicken burger on an onion bun with a fried egg and truffle mayo. The grilled chicken was really tender and moist. The onion bun was fresh and sooo soft. The fried egg was perfectly runny, and the mayo was so darn tasty! There were flecks of black truffle in the mayo, giving the mayo an awesome kick of truffle flavor. YUM!  The peppercorn burger was also a hit. The beef was cooked to a perfect medium with a hint of pink. They really piled on the peppercorns on the burger!  The sweet potato fries were fantastic as well. Probably some of the best ones I've had in a while.  Of course, we had to order the ROSSINI BURGER with Foie gras and black truffles.  Yes it is $60, but SO WORTH IT. The richness of the foie gras and the bold flavor of the truffles added so much flavor to the tender Wagyu beef. This has got to be the BEST burger I've ever had. The beef was so tender and the flavors were just heavenly. Since the burger is 60 bucks, they let you choose any side you want with the burger and you also get a free dessert! We tried the mac and cheese croquettes and the chocolate dessert burger.  The croquettes were good, but paled in comparison to the burger.   The chocolate dessert burger was really good. Awesome dessert that works so well with the burger theme. The warm donut 'bun' was really good. It worked so well with the nutella mousse (the patty) and the passion fruit jelly (cheese). The richness and the tartness balanced each other out very nicely. It was a great way to end our meal!  Service was good. Our waiter was very nice, he was a little hard to track down, but  whatever, we were so focused on our food. I don't think we really cared. It's a little far from where I usually play on the strip, but it's a great place to get food on our way into or out of Vegas.",

And finally I went with their Hubert Keller Burger. It was good, but nothing worth writing to mom about. I actually enjoyed the fries more.  The same goes with the milkshake. It wasn't too rich or fatty or anything. And it was just the right amount.  But the HK Burger was just so-so. So-so that I had to box it and eat it later on.   Looks like I have to come back and try the other burgers. If this place is known for the \"best burgers\" you bet I'm going to give these guys at least another shot to see if it is True and maybe try out the Rossini burger. Will see!!",

On the bad side the burgers are bland. They seem like they were designed by some sort of roulette wheel of toppings.  Glacier like slow service and bland food do not make a good dining experience. The prices are ridiculous. You would be better off going to Holsteins. Better food, service, and beer.",

    "text": "Hubert Keller made his foray into gourmet burgers with the opening of his first Burger Bar in 2004. Shortly thereafter, several Burger Bars popped up luring customers with it's prime meats, tantalizing toppings and toothsome milkshakes. Whether you fancy an ultra-luxe $60 burger or if you prefer your burgers a little more spartan, Burger Bar can fulfill your needs.   Give your burger the ultimate treatment and choose from a dizzying array of toppings, including pan-seared foie gra, black truffles, lobster, large shrimp, homemade chili, prosciutto, fried eggs, jalapeno bacon and more.   After tossing a few options back and forth, I decided to go with the Hangover Burger --certified angus beef smothered in hangover sauce, chopped lettuce and served with fat fries. My friend ordered the same burger but the gluten-free version with sweet potato fries. We both relished every bite and lapping up all the hangover sauce with their tasty fries.   The birthday girl choose the Hubert Keller Burger, which comes with buffalo, carmelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. This namesake burger comes with a beautiful red wine shallot reduction sauce and many sides of hefty smiles.   And don't forget about ordering one of their signature milkshakes or choose from a staggering 60 ingredients to custom build your own milkshake. I had the Cowboy Milkshake -- whiskey and chocolate ice cream topped with chocolate marshmallows. It's very rich, almost like a chocolate mousse, so prepare yourself for one decadent treat.   Menu highlights include the American Kobe beef, buffalo, veggie, salmon, surf 'n turf burger with black angus and lobster tail. The Rossini Burger ($60) features wagyu beef foie gra and shaved truffles on an onion bun.   Wonderful burger joint tucked away in the Mandalay Bay Shopping Forum.",

The service was great and the bartender was very happy to chat us up about the selection of beers they had in bottles and on tap which my husband loved. I mean loved. He decided to just try every (almost every) beer on the tap we were seated near. There were about 8-10 in our section of the bar. Ugh.   Anyway, we shared an Angus burger with:   -caramelized onions  -on an onion bun  -jalapeno bacon  -provolone cheese  -button mushrooms  -skinny fries  -zucchini fries   The burger was so good. Cooked perfectly. The fries were average, nothing special. After we were done eating I wanted to do some shopping but hubs wasn't ready. When I walked out he was on his 4th beer. Oy. I returned about an hour later and he was still at the bar!   Anyway, I enjoyed the burger and he thoroughly enjoyed the beer.   Will I come back? Probably not. I think trying this place just once is good in my book.",

Hubert Keller was involved in the menu, so my expectations were high.   As usual, dishes are rated 1 - 10, 10 being amazing.  $4 Onion Rings (6) Decent rings, about 10 per order. Large and heavily battered.  $3 Fries (2) Thick cut, but not crisp on the outside. It was the texture of high school cafeteria fries. They came with a side of ranch dressing with the consistency of Gatorade.  $13 Classic Burger with Fries (4) My friend got this burger. I didn't try it, but it look like shit. I'm not sure how Keller puts is name on this crap.  $16 Kobe Beef Burger, $2 Swiss Cheese, $1 Caramelized Onions, $6 Truffle Sauce (2) If this was Kobe, then I don't doubt McDonald's will start serving it soon. It's American Kobe from Snake Rivers Farm, but I think they mix it with something else as well. The onions tasted as though they had been sitting for hours. The truffle sauce was decent for $6, but tasting of poor quality. Overall, this was trash.   $4 Side of Zucchini Fries (7) This and the onion rings were the only good things I had.  This food is absolutely shitty, go elsewhere. Perhaps, if you hook up with somebody that you regret in the morning, this would be an appropriate option.",

The service, on the other hand, was inexcusably bad.  The bartender was inattentive, impatient, rude and did not listen to us at all.  Worse yet, the manager supported this kind of behavior and had no sympathy whatsoever for what they were choosing to call a \"miscommunication\".  We waited almost 45 minutes for a burger which we later found out was never even put in because the bartender was not listening.  After calmly inquiring after our burger, we were told that we never ordered one, but that it would be put in on the fast track.  Apparently the fast track meant we would have to wait yet another 30 something minutes for a medium rare burger.  Under the circumstances, I'm not sure if the burger was even good or if we were just starving.",

    "text": "Hands down, best burger I have ever eaten. Before even entering Mandalay Bay, I was telling myself to critically rate this restaurant for every minute detail. Working from a fast food burger joint (In-N-Out Burger), I've had my plentiful shares of burgers from all sorts of places and arriving at one of my favorite chef's resto, Hubert Keller, I was pleasantly impressed  Accompanied by the 2 most trustworthy women in my life, we busted a \"Lord of the Ring's\" journey to get here. From the Manadalay Bay entrance, the Burger Bar is far... Once arrived at this eatery, I noticed the settings is quite dim and social. There was a bar ofcourse but there were also booths and tables. Great take on a mix between a \"fine brewery\". The place \"looked\" packed and we had to wait for a good 15 min. for a booth but there were already a couple of empty booths so I didn't understand the point of waiting... Our server was nice at first but like a oddly new friend that you meet who suddenly opens up the next day, you see their real side and you don't like it. She was serving us like a quick Asian at an oriental restaurant. Didn't really care for hospitality, but got our orders right. She was also pregnant so maybe it was a mood swing that we ended up seeing?... I dunno. Anyways, onto what we ordered:  Marinated Chicken Breast Burger w/ Swiss Cheese on a Whole Wheat Bun - Great chicken taste, nice and tender and the slice was not too big to overwhelm the swiss cheese or the bun. The cheese even had holes in it! The bun to compliment was great as well. Fluffy and a discerning wheat taste. These guys weren't playing around with the choices of ingredients.  Black Jack Burger on a Ciabatta - a thick beefy behemoth with thick italian square buns. It wasn't accompanied with any cheese (cuz my girl didn't ask for any) but the taste was still apparent. Medium well, moist ground up beef which was well seasoned and full of flavor. I really wished there was some sauce to accompany it but for a mere bread, meat, and veg combo, it still tasted out of the ordinary.   Surf and Turf Burger on an Onion Bun - as a lover for steak and lobster, this burger was right up my alley. Think of a cheesecake with a graham cracker crust topped with thick full whip cream... but SAVORIZED! The asparagus was buttered with the texture of a moist graham cracker, my medium rare black angus didn't seem as big as the Black Jack Burger's but the texture was pure butta (that thing couldn't keep together on a fork). The lobster was perfectly cooked, tender for a lean meat, and complimented the steak and asparagus texturely, perfectly! I was kind of worried the server didn't ask me if I wanted cheese on it, but honestly you don't need any. Just another flavor to get in the way of the stars of the show. On the down side, from how moist everything was, it made the bottom bun really soggy. Nevertheless, the onion bun had an onion taste that you could not miss (which was great!)   The lettuce, onions, and tomatoes on the side of these burgers were fresh and crisp. It could've been a side salad all together. Plus the pickle garnish had nice suttle taste, not overwhelming like your at home jar pickles, but almost like a cucumber palate cleanser.  Typing about side salads, I had one as one of my sides. It wasn't all that great, but with drenched olive oil for a dressing , it did have a good enough taste to finish. The other sides we had were fat fries and sweet potato fries. Fat fries were crispy and thick, which I thought tasted way better than the flimsy sweet potato fries. About sweet potato fries, they are popping up everywhere now, sadly these aren't the best I had.  Service was slow, food was tasty and fast, and the price was reasonable. Everything came up to be a good 60 bux plus tip, quality = price tonight. FYI: each booth had a mini TV on the side playing some type of sport. That's just overkill with the whole bar meets fine dining theme, but hey it sells! It was a great experience for all 3 of us and I would definitely come here again. Portion size is just right for a hungry person, and the taste is incomparable.",

    "text": ":o)  It pains me to give Burger Bar four stars.  First of all, I'm not typically a burger type of gal, except when it comes to In n Out, but everything surpassed my expectations and was super tasty.  Unfortunately, my burger's lobster was overcooked and service slightly disappointed me.  :(    BURGERS: Hubert Keller burger - Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun.  The buffalo added the perfect amount of gaminess to give this burger a good earthy kick with the blue cheese to add a mildness to it.  Which was slightly odd since blue cheese has so much flavor and usually packs a bold punch.  Everything harmonized beautifully and I was happy to chomp away.   Surf & Turf - Black Angus, grilled half lobster, grilled green asparagus on a plain bun.  Sadly, the lobster was overcooked and was chewy.  Other then that, the green asparagus complemented this burger perfectly.  American Classic - Black Angus beef, America cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun.  A very good basic burger.  The juiciness of the beef makes this one exceptional.  SIDES: Sweet potato fries - Hands down the sweet potato fries won the sides battle.  They were very typical very good sweet potato fries.  Good ratio of sweetness and saltiness, and nice and crispy  Onion rings - These babies reminded me of the onion rings you get at Carl's Jr. with the same texture and crispiness.  The biggest difference between the ones at Burger Bar is that the onions doesn't slide right out of the ring.  :)   Aioli - Do yourself a favor and just get it.  It's so good.  I wanted to cover my hands with this sauce and lick it all day.  I know it sounds absolutely disgusting, but it was soooooo good!!  Zucchini fries, Skinny fries, Fat fries - They're all good, but not amazing.  From a service standpoint, I was a bit disappointed because we told the server that it was my friend's birthday.  Sadly, she didn't bring us a little burger dessert, but we were stuffed beyond all belief to even fathom having another bite.  Here's a little note.  Keep their number on hand.  Even though they don't take reservations, you can call them to ask them for a wait time and to put your party on the list.  It's almost like a fast pass for the Burger Bar.  :)",

    "text": "Save your money. This place is not very good and not worth the high price for a burger.   I don't mind paying more for a burger just because of a gimmick or because the place is in a nice hotel on the strip. However, I would like the food to be really good. It's barely average here. I did the create your own and it wasn't satisfying for the price. Maybe half the price. The fries taste like cardboard. Usually, I clean my fries up. I left half of them.   Another person in my party got the sliders. They were pretty bland as well. The buffalo one was interesting.   I feel like they have too many unique offerings and not enough made to order selections. Give the vegetarian, buffalo, Kobe beef, lobster, lamb, and other unique selections their own page or section. When you take all of those out, they really only have three made to order burgers. The classic, peppercorn and one other.    The Create your own features too many options and could also get expensive. Also, you risk your customer not being satisfied by a bad combination of toppings. I would also recommend they come up with a signature sauce and push it.   They need more, interesting made to order options. Or more interactive servers that guide you through the menu. Ours was nice but not helpful.   We got a trio of ice cream/mousse desserts that were not great either. A frozen strawberry shouldn't taste so much like a frozen strawberry.   Don't waste your time. Go to the food court at Luxor lol...",

I decided to go with the burger, to see if the place can live up to its name and not only was it priced rather reasonably, but it was pretty delicious. Eventhough it is located in a mall type setting, the ambiance is inside is pretty tolerable. Some of the other visitors were consuming BMCs, as the name would absolutely attract \"beer junkies,\" that live on Bud Light and other such delicacies, and some of the waitresses, whose natural shapes have been modified by surgeons operating in the fields of plastics, had no shame in not knowing much about the good beer, but nevertheless, for this locale, if you must have craft beer- this is one of the stops that I would recommend.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to go to Burger Bar in Vegas since the first time I went three years ago. In October, my husband and I finally sat down at the bar and had our burgers at Mandalay Place.  That's when I ordered the best milkshake in the world. It's the Black and White Cookie milkshake. It was like Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough ice cream, but better. It was orgasmic. I was dying over this milkshake. It probably was 1,500 calories, but damn if it wasn't worth it.  Since my husband and I are pescetarian, you would think that a burger place wouldn't be as capable of handling us. Not so at Burger Bar! I ordered the most incredible salmon burger, cooked to perfection. My husband ordered the vegan option, which was two amazing portobello mushroom caps with tons of veggies in the middle. Not only was it incredible to see a vegan option at a major restaurant, but it was a very tasty option.   The fries were eh, but the next time I am ordering the zucchini fries. They looked amazing. The line outside looked super-long, but I give full credit to Hubert Keller for taking something as common as hamburgers and milkshakes and elevating them to levels of perfection that you never thought they could reach.",

    "text": "So, we hit this place up twice during our week stay in Vegas. We were at the Luxor, so it was a short walk to get to here.  To anyone who orders their burgers anything but mid rare-rare. What is wrong with you? That being said, our first experience was pretty awesome.  We didn't have to wait more than 5 minutes. We ordered the sliders to start and they were heavenly. Anything on brioche is sure to be fabulous.  I ordered a kobe burger medium rare with jalapenos, jalapeno bacon, guacamole and pepper jack cheese. It was heaven. The husband ordered a kobe as well, but I can't remember what was on his. The only issue I had with the service was that we had to ask for several things that should have come with the burgers. They forgot my bacon and my jalapenos and they forgot my husband's aioli. I had the sweet potato fries. They were delicious.  The second trip, I ordered the Guinnes float which was fantastic. I ordered a NatureSource burger mid rare, but it came out well done and I couldn't eat it. It was totally dry. The server never came back around after her first check in so when I finally had a chance to tell her that the burger was overcooked, Jared has finished all of his food. She offered me another burger but I said no thank you. I had to refuse two more times because she kept trying to give me another burger. I didn't want to sit and eat while my husband had already finished his meal AND we had reservations for a nice dinner in like 3 hours so we really had to go and get ready for that. They took it off the bill, so no harm I guess.  I figure that if the service wasn't so spotty, it would be a 5 star place. The burgers are fantastic when cooked right, and the prices are average for Vegas and well worth it for those delicious burgers.",

There are so many choices that its like the Starbucks of burgers. Of course they have their flashy menu items, but also they have great classics done right, order bacon on your burger and you'll understand why!!

Just get them as your side instead of the sweet potato or regular fries...trust me.  Didn't have a shake or anything, but they did have a nice beer list and I enjoyed the Shiner Bock on tap.  The waitress wasn't very attentive.   Overall I probably wouldn't go back because I could get just as good if not better somewhere else.  I will add that when I was at Bobby Flay's restaurant for brunch that day (Mesa Grill at Caesars Palace) they were bringing out some of their burgers that people ordered and they looked really tasty.  Might have to try one next time I go back to Lost Wages...er...I mean Las Vegas.",

After about 5 minutes she came back with another pickle and removed the hair. That was it, no manager, no offer to make a new plate.

    "text": "I came here on a Saturday and there was a two hour wait. I asked when there slow period was and they said in a really obnoxious voice \"We don't have a slow time\". Um this was not True. We went back during the week and waited like 10 minutes (even though there were empty seats, and walked by several times during the week when there was no wait at all. So, the key here is to go during the week. OK as far as the burgers, my burger was cooked perfectly and the topping options is wonderful (loved the caramelized onions). The fries were good, but I think I would do the sweet potato fries next time. Also, I wanted a shake but at $8+ that was just crazy (I mean it made the $5 shake in Pulp Fiction appear to be a bargain). All in all a good burger place that I would return back to.",

They have an awesome veggie burger and tons of toppings like picked green tomatoes, fried egg, asparagus, blue cheese and so many more.. to create your own burger experience. The skinny fries are also to die for. Relaxed atmosphere... love sitting at the bar. They also have really good beer on tap!",

    "text": "WOW! What a great burger joint! I've only had the pleasure of trying it once and ordering takeout since the wait is ridiculously long, but 4.5 stars! Ordered the Burger Bar Sliders so that we could try three different burgers. One was Angus, pretty good, very basic. A little dab of mayo and mustard and it's perfect. The next was the bacon burger which was my least favorite out of the three because the patty was a bit dry and not as flavorful. The last was the onion burger and I think this is the reason that makes Burger Bar so popular. The patty was so tender and moist, one bite into it and it was oozing with juices. The caramelized onions enhances the rich flavor of the beef, my mouth probably said oh em gee! If you get the chance, order it with sweet potato fries to top it off!",

    "text": "i visit my parents in Nevada once in a while and I also visit the strip with friends. My dad said he would like to take me to a nice place to get a burger. I wasn't about to argue with that. We put our names down and they have a system that sends a text when they are ready to seat you. Really nice! So about 20-30 mins later I get the text and I'm raring to go. We get seated and our server seems like a nice chap. I order a beer, my dad as well and my mom a water. He returns with 3 beers and no water. Not a big deal, my dad or I will just end up drinking it anyhow. It was a simple error. They have preset burgers and they have a make your own burger with several options of meat. I don't recall what my mom got but she got the sweet potato fries on the side. I got the thin cut fries on the waiters recommendation and some pepper jack bomb things. My dad and I got the Australian Wagyu style patties. He got his medium well, he was actually going with well done, but the waiter talked him out of it. The right call in my opinion. I got mine medium rare. While waiting for food I got another beer as the first one went down quick and my dad started on the extra beer already. The food arrives and the burgers have those little plastic sticks in them that indicate how they are cooked. They reminded me of Sizzlers as a kid. We dig in. The pepper jack bombs were small nuggets of cheese battered and fried well, they weren't too gooey and had a nice bit of heat. The thin fries pretty much tasted like pretty generic thin cut fries from anywhere. The sweet potato fries had a crispy seasoned coating and weren't bad. Now, I didn't get around to asking my parents how their food was. They seemed to like what they got, but I was treating my parents and they are the type to not complain in the case. Here's where things started to get disappointing. Our waiter just seemed to up and vanish. I'm not totally sure, but it seemed he never returned after dropping the food off. I cut my burger in two before starting on it. My burger nearly mooed out load as my blade fell. The patty was extremely rare, but somehow one side was cooked slightly more than the other. That half I ate, and honestly nothing about that burger was memorable or had any distinct taste. We were more than done and our waiter had still not checked on us. I ended up asking a busboy to get him for us. I pointed out the burger and he agreed that it was undercooked. The host/manager came by and told us he removed it from the check. The place may deserve a second chance, but based on the experience and the dizzying variety of other places to try in the area I don't think I will give it one.",

The hostess was on the phone when we walked up and was telling someone that it is recommended to make a reservation, although not required.  Our waitress was so nice. I had a phone call that I had to take while our food was being prepared and while I was outside the restaurant, she actually came and let me know that the food was on the table. She also checked in with us every so often to make sure that everything was good.  I really like how you can basically build your own burger.   I got the regular burger (medium) with American cheese, avocado, and bacon on a whole wheat bun. Bacon was crispy, but everyone seems to like it that way so I should've asked to have it a little bit on the softer side. Burger was cooked perfectly.  C got the buffalo burger (medium) with sprouts, cucumber, and bacon on an onion bun. Burger was cooked to order. The cucumber slices were HUGE.  We both got the sweet potato fries, which were good (as usual).  I could only eat half of my burger (I wasn't very hungry), so the waitress brought out a doggy bag to take with us. She delivered the doggy bag and the check quickly and we were in and out within an hour.  I will definitely go back if I have the chance. Just wish it was a little closer to the center of the strip!",

    "text": "Offering a sizable length of rope is a dangerous thing, especially when a high percentage of your clientele will hang themselves with it. At Burger Bar, the rope is a massive number of options for each and every component of your burger. That's thousands of burger permutations, many of which are truly awful.   Vegas is great for people watching and Burger Bar is great for burger watching: take note as Lance from Des Moines constructs his demon spawn burger and then complains about the resulting assault on his palette.   You'll also notice those deer-in-the-headlights expressions when patrons first get a look at the number of menu offerings. The Burger Bar staff will not jump-in with recommendations. Do not be surprised by this. They don't eat there. It is just not possible. They're all amazing fit.   Anyway, 5 stars for this combo: *  1/2 pound Angus Beef, medium rare * Whole Wheat bun * Sauteed Mushrooms * Caramelized Onions * Blue Cheese  The Burger Bar beer menu is huge with many beers on tap, so pair your burger with a cold one and some thick cut fries.",

The only drawback with this place is that there has always been wait to get seated. Luckily for me during my most recent visit there was room for us at the bar so we were seated right away!   This time around I had the kobe burger with jalapeno flavored bacon and pepper jack cheese on a wheat bun and steak fries, having a slight hang over I really couldn't think of anything better to have than the burger listed above and a nice cold beer. When it comes to beers the Burger Bar has no shortage of them, with a beer list that is as long and as extensive as most top restaurants wine lists. I ended up ordering an organic beer called Stone Mill which was unreal, I am going to yelp about that as well :)  Like most good things this also isn't cheap, however it is worth going to once in a great while to treat yourself and your friends to a killer burger and I cannot think of a better place to do this at.",

However the reason I am giving it 3 stars is because my  girlfriend spent the night with what seemed to be food poisoning. Besides her burger we shared everything else she ordered. With only one night in Vegas it really stamped out our night. We were also driving back home to Oregon the next day. So instead of making the trip in one day we had to get a room for next night due to her not feeling well. The experience in the restaurant was awesome however the repercussions of her veggie burger was extremely unfortunate.",

    "text": "I think its time for a vegetarian (or at least non-beef eater) to weigh in on this whole Burger Bar phenom.  The vegeburger is always an underestimated menu item, thrown in as an afterthought by most carniverous restaurants as a half-hearted olive branch so that the meat eaters can drag their vegehead friends with them, but usually they are very basic and do not offer choice options or ways to jazz them up like are typically offered for meat burgers-so any opportunity to play around with the vegeburger medium is a place I'm in the mood to try!  After ordering a vegeburger with portabello mushrooms and jack cheese, I gotta say that I am TOTALLY a fan of this place now!  Their patty was closer to a gardenburger than to a boca burger, which is how i prefer my nonmeat burgers to be.  The mushrooms were plentiful and the cheese was melted to perfection.    As a fantastic side, the zucchini fries were amazing.  Fried to perfection with ranch to dip them in, these definately made my night.  Since I was staying at Mandalay Bay, they let me phone down my order and pick it up in about 10 minutes.  When I got there, I overheard the hostess telling a customer that the table wait was about 15-20 minutes for a table for two.  Not bad considering how long you have to wait for tables in other places in vegas, but I definately was pleased with my choice of to-go.  Overall a great meal that was a complete BARGAIN for like $13.  The cheapest meal I had in vegas, and the quality was probably the best. Will definately be back again.",

There's something about a milkshake and a burger together.     Helpful hint- there's always a wait here, but you can avoid the wait and sit at the bar top(best seat in the house) right away.

We started the meal off with a nutella chocolate milkshake. I'm not a big fan of shakes, but the nutella whipped cream was delicious.   They give you the option of selecting your patty (ground chuck, angus, kobe, turkey or veggie) and then a huge array of toppings to select from.  Each topping comes with a price tag, so the crazier you get the more your burger will cost you.  They had a $60 burger on the menu that was a kobe beef burger with black truffles and truffle oil and 4 or 5 cheeses...insane!  Jeff and I both went with the Angus beef burger. I kept my burger simple with pepper jack cheese, guacomole, and jalapeno bacon. yes, jalepeno bacon. It was so spicey and so good! Definitely a great concept. Jeff got Monterey Jack cheese, peppered bacon and Avacado that was simple but delicious.  They had a ton of fry options but we decided on \"fat fries\" which were a thicker cut. fry    Everything was very tasty. It was also priced just right. Both good things in my mind :)",

The wait was quite long but we were able to wrangle some seats at the bar and seeing as it was another hour wait for a table we just ordered our food there.  Getting a burger the way you wanted it was great. So many choices. The wife and best freind had the original burger while I had the peppercorn burger. First things first, the server actually asked us how we wanted the burger cooked. Not the usual let me burn the burger to a crisp and slap it in a bun and call it a burger. We got it medium because our server said they usually under cook the meat so our burger was pink all the way through and super juicy. The wife added a fried egg which was done right (a little runny yolk in the center, not like fatburger where it's over cooked). Made the burger more rich. The peppercorn burger came with a peppercorn sauce to pour on the burger which was delicious. Then each burger came with a side. (Had the sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, fried pickle, and onion rings.)  Each was good, though my favorite was the fried zucchini.   Damn I'm craving a burger as I write this review. Let's just say it was that good.",

    "text": "Burger Bar is definitely a Vegas must....it was a bit difficult to find but that may be due to my gender and our proclivity of not wanting to ask for directions.   I have been here twice, the first time was quite a good experience, wait staff was on their game and very attentive. I had the Angus on wheat with swiss, jalapeno bacon and a fried egg. Very good burger, although the patty did lack some seasoning but that may just be a personal gripe as I opt for seasoned meat over a plethora of toppings. Do watch out for the first bite when getting the fried egg, lets just say it was closer to sunny side up than over medium.   My second time at the BB I was a bit displeased with the overall experience. The hostesses were rude and there were 3 of them standing doing nothing at a podium made for one person. The only thing worse than the attitude was the fact that the wait was about an hour but I can deal with the wait, its Vegas and there is always something to do while you are waiting. On to the food, I mistakenly ordered the slider sampler thinking that I could get a taste of the buffalo and kobe burgers without having to order the entire burger. What I got was 3 small tasteless burgers that were on the slightly overcooked side. Least I had some sweet potato fries to help calm the hunger pangs.   All in all if you like options and you like creativity you need to check this place out but be prepared to shell out an extra few bucks if you want to go all out. I have yet to try to the surf and turf burger...waiting to hit the progressive jackpot before shelling out the 30 bucks or so it is for that one.",

    "text": "All I can say is jalapeno bacon!!!!!!   Okay really wanted the best or one of the best burgers in Vegas OTS. After several reviews we decided to give it a shot. Decided on the Kobe with cheddar and all the fix ins. Gf had the black angus beef w/jalapeno bacon, cheese, shared fries and had a beer. Bartender recommended an IPA for me (delicious, creamy not too heavy and potent). I am coming to the realization that I am not a huge Kobe fan but for some reason I keep trying. Fries came first, average steak fries with Good ranch. Burgers came and mine was okay. GF's burger was awesome. Perfectly cooked-med-but it was the jalapeno bacon that made the meal. It was spicy and delicious a must try. I would definitely return and try more beer other options and dessert!",

    "text": "Mmmmmm... burger bar...  Okay, so we found this place in a Japanese guide book and we were worried that it might not still be around... so we schlepped out there and arrived to find the place was hopping. We didn't have to wait too long to get a seat.  The menu at this place is amazing. Basically, you construct a burger with whatever toppings you want. And they have pretty much everything. It was everything I could do not to go hog wild and make the most expensive burger known to man, so I went with a spicy buffalo theme. I ordered the buffalo (delicious cow like animal) and got jalapenos and pepper jack, the fried zuccini, and a chocolate banana shake (not on the menu, but they made it anyway). The wife had salmon.  I was in burger heaven. I mean, it was really one of the best burgers I've ever had in my entire life. The wife wasn't enjoying her salmon and so she wasn't too pleased. She was happier when I gave her the rest of my shake though (cause it was soooo good).  Anyway, one little detail that I thought was awesome was that when my jalapenos came, there were picked ones and fresh ones. And they had ketchup, mustard, and A1 sauce at every table.  So, in the end, the waitress was kind of a bitch, but this random other dude kept helping us out, so we left her a little tiny tip and gave the random dude some gambling chips, and we were off.  Excellent place, come with the guys.",

It was not.  Swiss Cheese.....Good. Oyster Mushrooms.....Not-so-good....Tasted as-if-out-of-a-can.... Bun......Very Good....Toasty, potatoey... Fried Egg....And here is the reason for the low score...... NO YOKE....NO YOKE....I advised both the Waitress and the manager (whom the waitress sent over) and neither of them offered to have another egg made.  The Waitress even said, 'That's the best part.\"  No shat!!!!!  Wings.....Great....tasted the Red Hot....Which is how it should be......  Beer....Was bottled, so it was Great........  So yelp has decided to filter this review. DO NOT GO TO BURGER BAR...... So many other places that are doing high-end burgers right....and this place is not...  From 6-25-2012",

Can you imagine a great meal, anywhere, of any kind, in which you're relegated to \"ya-hoo!\" (which, by the way, it's not whoohoo!, it's yahoo!  Think I'm wrong?  Quote a movie, \"WHOHOO!\".  I'm waiting...is the search engine named \"whohoo\"?  No. It is not. It's yahoo.   Ok, March 2014, NCAA March Madness, my buddy Brian says, meet us at Burger Bar 1:30.  I got there 1:15 and they're already eating.  Not ordering, 1/2 way through the burgers!  Ok, whaddya-gonna-do? Now I gotta QUICKLY order so as not to lag too far behind...and I order the Hangover Burger, they say, \"smothered in hangover sauce\".  I can only imagine.   So,  while the boys are eating, I'm waiting, and Joey, a douchebag from Great Neck, Joey says, \"...how is it possible that every burger here (5) are perfectly cooked?\".  And I gotta tell ya, I don't know.  Most steak houses use the press method = you press down on the meat, steak or burger, and the firmness indicates the cooked temp....you can google \"steak temperatures using your hand\" and it's a simplistic guide...make no mistake: 5 burgers and then mine, PERFECT!  I do know how they did it.  I'm not telling.  State secrets.  And it is very elementary.  My burger was absolutely delicious. Terrific burger, great service.   GO THERE NOW!",

    "text": "This place came highly recommended by my good friends who I consider to have great taste in fine cuisine. We went for lunch and ordered the Kobe beef burger (cooked medium), with the onion bun, brie, grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, lettuce, and tomatoes. We also added truffle mayo and chipotle aioli sauces on the side with fat fries.   The patty was juicy and pink all the way through. It would have been perfect, HOWEVER, it was a little underseasoned. We had to constantly spread sauce to it. The fat fries were well cooked (crispy on the outside, soft on the inside). All the extras complimented the patty well.   Since today is National Donut Day, we ordered the sweet Nutella donut burger, which is basically a Nutella patty enclosed in a Krispy Kreme glazed donut. It had strawberries for tomatoes, kiwis for pickles, and a passion fruit jelly slice for cheese. HOW CUTE, and delicious. It wasn't as rich as I thought it would be.   TL;DR: burger was good, patty a little underseasoned. Get one of the dessert burgers!",

    "text": "WOW! The best way I can describe the delectable burger and smooth velvety milkshake I had here at the infamous Burger Bar! Mom and I had a date to visit Lush and we decided we were hungry. I read about BB on here(yelp) and remembered it was in Mandalay Place and thought it sound like a plan!   First off follow the sign to valet in the Mandalay Place. Go up the escalators make a u-turn and voila BURGER BAR! It's on your left hand side! We got to the hostess stand and put our name down and then had the bejeezus scared out if us! The hostess was literally SCREAMING parties names....this was beyond annoying!! We had a 15 minute wait time so we pre-shopped lush a little then went back to BB just in time for the hostess to scream my name right at my face :/   We were sat near the back and upon sitting and ordering drinks I absolutely regret not just sitting at the counter! Ill explain later about our not so awesome server....Mom ordered a strawberry mojito, eh I can make better. I had the best milkshake I've ever tasted....EVER! Salted caramel o M g this thing was the best texture and flavor and creamy and sexy and amazing and every positive word in the dictionary all at once. It took every fiber of my being not to chug it in one drink!   Now onto my burger I had a naturesource burger on an onion bun with jalapeno bacon, mushrooms, caramelized onions, and truffle mayo.the combination was perfect and the burger was juicy and messy and I couldn't stop eating it! It was cooked to a perfect medium and I've never tasted anything like it! The truffle mayo was a perfect compliment and made the burger. I ordered the fat fries which were awesome. Mom ordered the onion rings which I didn't care for...  Now onto the service. We were sitting between two side stations, both of which we got to see our very social server be extra social when we needed things. She would say I'm going to drop this drink off and come right back....after telling the other server how last night was right? The food deserves 5 stars, easily. The screaming hostess' and gossipy server take that very well deserved star away. Will I be back? ABSO FREAKING LUTELY!",

The food and service here is great, whether I come here by myself or with 18 other Yelpers!  I came up with a new creation.  I call it, the Shawn H. Burger!  Give it a try :P  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-las-vegas?userid=eZZyuJDouIg4p-GYB3PV_A#bf50r1MXyZaFeASlyngAiA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a>  Angus on Ciabatta, Foie Gras, Truffle Mayo, Black Perigord Truffle Sauce! My best combination and burger to date!!  I usually spend the money on Angus here, because even their most basic burger trumps the other guys in town.  I've had their Waygu here, but it is NOT necessary, and I'd rather spend that extra $7-8 towards the Foie Gras personally!  The Foie Gras melts in your mouth, and is like butter on top of your burger!  The truffle mayo is perfection on top of everything and blends perfection in each bite.  The Black Perigord Truffle Sauce was very subtle, but it adds to the moisture in the bread.  You could skip this last element if you need to, but make sure you have the other options!  And the ciabatta is the perfect bread to absorb those medium rare juices...staying firm and keeping your hands clean, even with all those juices hitting the plate.  And don't forget to finish with a Nutella Shake!  One of the best things you'll eat if you are a nutella fan!",

DAMN!! that first bite was vegas worthy and worth the $25. Hahaha  Also ordered the salted caramel shake and ga-damn that hit the spot.  LOVE this place.  Check it out if your ever in the area.",

They have an extensive beer menu (I love the Framboise, my husband likes the black and blonde- Guiness and Heffy).  They have great fries (sweet potato, zucchini, pickles, skinny, fat) and you build your own burger.  You can choose from a variety of patties- 3 kinds of beef (including Kobe), turkey, salmon, and a delicious house-made veggie burger (the best I have ever had).  You can choose from a variety of buns including ciabatta, various sauces and interesting toppings (including pickled green tomatoes).  This is Hubert Keller's restaurant, the same chef from Fleur De Lys.  One of my fav restaurants in Vegas!",

This is my go to place prior to heading to the airport and for some reason I have luck afterwards to gain some money gambling at Mandalay Bay. But enough about my lucky streak; you're here to read my review.  The chefs who cook the burgers always get it the way I wanted whether medium or medium-rare.  Choice of bread or condiments is top notch and the fries ( the skinny ones) is great.  Service is very attentive and friendly.  Reason I gave them four stars is it is still very noisy even on a quiet friday  afternoon.  P.s., splurge a little and order an american kobe beef  burger(rare) with skinny fries and Primo beer.  Condiments are up to you(my was with guacamole).",

Love the choices, and as a reviewer mentioned not sure I can taste the difference in meat choices.  It's probably because I customize with too many toppings.  Service is always good and the shakes are excellent (Tried the mint chocolate chip this time).  Usually get some sides of rings and sweet potato fries to share.  Beer choice is excellent, over 100 on tap? Tried a beer sampler as well this time...very filling.  Every time I have eaten here, I 've had to wait about 30-45 minutes.  I did take the advice of someone that said you can call ahead to be put on the waitlist so our party of twelve waited only 5 minutes to be seated with a call about 30 minutes prior.  This place does not dissapoint...casual comfort food but quality eats for the price (avg bill was $25/each including drinks and sides).",

None of them impressed me much, they were cooked medium which is the only choice for sliders but it was only medium in the very center, the rest was a little too cooked (probably due to the small size). The Hostess seemed extremely unhappy when I arrived with my friends and when i left i said bye, she bid me farewell with the same sad state of emotion... kinda killed it. As i was saying, the burgers lacked any \"interesting\" flavors despite the delicious description in the menu. The sliders were quite small and overall just didn't impress me as far as taste. Even though each burgers used different beef, they all tasted much the same. Presentation was pretty and the fat fries were pretty good but that just didn't cut it for a $20+ bill... i was gonna go for the ballin 60 dollar burger with truffles etc but opted not to at the last moment. Now im curious how that would have been. hahaha",

I would say the same of the service and the ambiance. I had an angus burger with the usual fixings plus avocado... cooked perfectly, I noted, otherwise forgettable.  As a table we also ordered the skinny fries and the onion rings, the former being much better than the latter.  I tried my friend's Ridgefield burger and I thought that meat was a lot more flavorful despite being told the Angus would be the superior option.  I'd say go with a Ridgefield burger with more toppings to add some kick and an order of the skinny fries to share.  I would go again and try something different and give my buddy Hubert and his excellent reputation another chance, but definitely disappointing, I'm sorry to say.",

The Burger Bar is conveniently located in the shopping wing, Mandalay Place at Mandalay Bay.  It's not really so much a bar...it reminds me more of like an upscale ice cream parlor.  The place is pretty spacious with counter seating and wood booths with granite tables. They offer a wide range of beers, both domestic and imported specialties, along with their version of the 'six dollar' burger.  The burgers are gourmet style, courtesy of Hubert Keller and are actually worth their inflated price.  They use some real top grade beef...Ridgefield Farms corn fed beef to Black Angus beef to American Kobe beef...they have something to satisfy the most discerning beef lover.  Not fond of beef, try their lamb, buffalo, chicken, or turkey burger.  For something more healthy, they also have salmon steaks and a veggie burger.  I tried the Ridgefield Farms American Classic burger, which came with bacon, lettuce, and a tomato slice.  The surprise on the menu, next to the $60 Rossini burger (Kobe beef laced with foie gras and truffles), are the many condiments that one can add to your burger...over 40 different choices.  I opted for the jalepenos and peppered jack cheese.  And here, when you ask for medium rare, it comes medium rare...it came out perfect.  Also a surprise, the service...excellent and attentive.  Worth the splurge...go have one!",

I was recovering from an evening of WHOO HOO and needed some protein that wasn't covered in grease or had mystery \"cheese food\" on it. Two people ordered the mini slider plates and said they were the best burgers they have ever had! I had the turkey burger with carmelized onions, cranberry sauce and blue cheese on an onion bun...and MAN, that was one hang-over cure! Another friend who embraces the \"stinky cheese\", had the Hubert Keller Burger and his only complaint was there needed to be MORE of the blue cheese (but he's an over-the-top kind of guy anyway).  The skinny fries and the sweet potatoe fries were just heavenly....I didn't order my own, but scrounged off other people b/c I didn't think they would be as wonderful as they were....my loss... We were all full, but the Chocolate Burger sounded all kinds of yummy, so we just ordered one to have a little taste...I wish I had ordered my own....I am dedicated to now try making my own at home for a special b.b.q. party this summer! It was to die for chocolate-y and the presentation delightful. The bill for five people, with a couple of alcoholic drinks each, tax and tip was a respectable $120. Being as it was a late lunch, i didn't need dinner later so it really was a good deal. Some reviewers have said that its very noisy, but we found it just pub-like: a constant, gentle murmur with sudden peaks of laughter and clinking, but not obtrusive or a detriment to conversation. But that could have been b/c of the very cosy booth having such tall backs. I would go there again in a flash.  MacDonald's lovers please try some real burger for a change!",

Being a non-carnivore, I did not have a burger, or even a veggie burger, but opted for the Cobb salad. It was pretty good - I'd probably order it again. It would have been great but I didn't really care for the vinaigrette dressing, although I think that the dressing definitely made it feel a bit lighter, which is a good thing in Las Vegas. I did try the fries, onion rings and sweet potato fries and all were very good. I really enjoyed the sweet potato fries. They're served with ketchup but if you ask for a side of ranch dressing, they'll gladly bring it to you, and the ranch went nicely with the sweet potato fries as well as the onion rings. I also tried the vanilla milkshake and it was pretty delicious. The service was friendly, it was easy to get in for a late lunch, and the prices are not outrageous. I'd return.",

    "text": "I'd like to think of myself as a burger connoisseur of sorts as I've eaten the best and worst burgers throughout the country. Burger bar falls in the middle, there's absolutely nothing special about this burger. It didn't make my mouth water, it didn't leave me counting down to the next visit, but it didn't leave me needing some water to wash the taste out of my mouth either.  The best thing about the place was the fries. I had the fat fries and they were delicious...maybe they should consider a name change to Fry Bar? They have fat fries, skinny fries, and sweet potato fries. My mom had the sweet potato fries and she said they were average, but loved my fat fries.  The best thing about the burger was it's size. It's a pretty thick burger. The worst thing about it, was that it was dry. I ordered my burger medium rare, I expect to see at least a little blood, there was none.  The service gets 2 stars. I went on a Sunday for lunch, probably my first mistake being a local and fighting the masses of hungover zombie looking folks. The wait was 30 minutes, not what I was looking for, but by the time I would've gone elsewhere, the 30 minutes would've been up. I ended up getting a seat in the bar about 10 minutes into my wait. It took an additional 10 minutes for the bartender standing directly in front of me to take my drink order. Another 10 for him to bring me my rootbeer, and then when my burger came, there was nothing on it! No cheese, not lettuce, no pickle, no tomato...all of which says comes on it, except the cheese, which I ordered as an add on. My mom's veggie burger was cold.  I will not be back to this place",

    "text": "The Kobe beef burger was the best burger I've had. The bf and I made this our first stop when we got to Vegas. We (aka \"me\") also wanted to try one of their dessert burgers, so we decided to split a Kobe burger and then split the Cheesecake burger.   We got the Kobe burger, cooked medium, without any toppings *partially because we wanted to see the no frills version, partially because we just couldn't pick what to put on it*, and with a side of zucchini fries. There is a charge for splitting the plate, but they warn you ahead of time and make sure all the dressings *lettuce, tomato, onion* are provided for both burger halves.   I didn't realize no toppings literally meant nothing on the burger. It was a patty and a bun. Add the dressings to preference. No condiments on the burger already. After dressing my burger, I was ready to put some ketchup on my burger, but my bf reminded me that \"real\" burgers don't use ketchup. I took a bite, and was glad I didn't ruin it with ketchup. The meat was juicy enough that it didn't need ANYTHING. I probably would have eaten the patty by itself. I secretly regretted splitting the burger with the bf. I bet he did too. The zucchini fries were great too. Cut thinner than I usually see, and not soggy at all. Fried goodness.   I didn't expect too much from the cheesecake burger. I knew it was just a gimmick, but that's okay. I wanted to try the cute little donut burger. It was surprisingly good! The cheesecake was more like a mousse, and the drizzled some raspberry syrup on it as well.   However, if I went back, I'd opt for my own Kobe burger, and skip the dessert. I prefer a good beef burger over a good cheesecake burger any day .",

Mind you our waiter was great however the food service was extremely slow. We built our own burgers and all but one person ordered med-well and the other well done. We figured since she orderd hers well that what was taking so long. We go out food and but into a raw mooing burgers.  My husband isn't one to cause a scene about returning food so we just ate what we could and prayed we didn't throw it up later. I wasn't happy at all. The 2 stars are for the server.",

The skinny fries ($2.50) were just okay - sort of tasted like McDonald's.   We also tried the peanut butter burger ($3.95) at the end of our meal.  It's a donut with peanut butter mousse, jelly and kiwi, built to resemble a hamburger.  It was different and was worth a try.    Bottom line:  I would have easily given this place 5 stars if not for the lousy service (which was cold and inattentive).",

You can even add lobster into your burger if you want. Basically there is something for everyone here.  This was actually my second time back and this time I tried the Kobe Beef Patty. I added cheddar jack cheese, jalapeno bacon, jalapenos, fried egg, onions, ( I forgot to add mushrooms =**( )and got a side of buttermilk fried zucchini fries. They have all kind of fries at the burger bar.  I always have a hard time eating slowly and completely enjoying my food but I forced myself to eat slower than usual for this one. All I can say is WOW. My first bite was incredible!! As Homer would say \"MMMMMMM MMMMMM BURGEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEER\". The kobe patty was so juicy...truly an explosion of flavor. This is something that I could probably eat everyday during my trips to Vegas.  My trips to Vegas will never be complete until I make a stop at the Burger Bar. I also recommend going to Fat Tuesday for a monster drink, which is down a couple stores from Burger Bar, after you finish your burger.  5 STARS",

The wait for this place is long but worth it. We usually end up window shopping in the area and come back. Because of the size, it's not really the best place for large groups but it's still worth it.

    "text": "I saw that this was a restaurant owned by acclaimed celebrity chef Herbert Keller.  Recently he was featured on Top Chef Masters.  This was an economical opportunity to check out his culinary offerings. The place is located in the small mall that connects Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  It has sort of a grill and bar feel to it.  Super casual.    Their menu includes a build your own burger option, build your own milkshake and build your own sundae option.   Great it you are super picky, not good if you are indecisive!  I tried the top sirloin burger and added a few fixings.  I noticed that they had about everything you could think of to make your perfect standard to gourmet burger.  I was in the mood for a Hawaiian burger, but noticed they have everything BUT teriyaki sauce.   Bummer.  When I got my well done (by choice) burger, I noticed that the bun to meat ratio was a bit off.  \"Where's the beef?\"  I would have preferred a flatter patty so that it covers the span of the bread.  My first bite included everything but meat.  Verdict.  It was good, but not entirely great.  I could have settled for an In-N-Out burger.  Ouch.  Service was excellent.  You gotta love Vegas for that reason.    There are TV's at each booth which is set to ESPN and a few huge TV's at the bar.  TIP #1: If you like mayo, ask for the chipotle aioli.  It's a hint of smoky, garlicky pepper aioli (mayo).  Surprisingly tasty.",

The wait was about 20 minutes and they wanted us to sit at a table near the entrance which was an awkward looking location as people were coming close to it when they were entering and leaving. we declined and opted instead to wait an additional 15 minutes for something else. 5 minutes later we were seated at a comfy booth. They even let us bring our fat Tuesday drinks in. The atmosphere is sports bar like and fun. The waitress was nice and helpful when it came to the menu as it was our first time. She had some great recommendations. I had the Lamb Burger with customized toppings of caramelized onions and Jack cheese. The waitress warned that it wasn't for everyone and you either love it or hate it. I love gamey meats so to me it was flavorful and juicy. The zucchini fries could have been thicker cut because it seemed to be mostly batter but the fried batter was crisp and tasty so i enjoyed them. My girlfriend had the Hubert Keller Burger which was very tasty with just the right combination of toppings to satisfy. The skinny fries were decent French fries. We tried the martinis and they were good too. Would definitely go back to try one of their other creations!",

It is pricey but that is because these aren't the nasty McDonald style burgers. These are what I call gourmet burgers.   What is so unique about this place is that you get to create your burger by picking the meat, the bun and a variety of toppings...not your basics like lettuce, tomato, pickle but toppings like portabella mushrooms, fried egg, guacamole, etc.   We ordered the buffalo Burger on wheat with a fried egg and white american cheese and the grilled chicken on focaccia bread with guacamole, salsa and pepperjack cheese, both of us ordered the sweet potato fries. Every bite was wonderful. It is hard to find a place that serves sweet potatoe fries (which is a favorite of ours)!   We also had drinks from the bar. I had washington apple martinis and my husband had long island iced teas...made perfectly.   Service was ok...but then again it was VERY busy. We got lucky to find a seat at the bar otherwise we would have had to wait 40 mins for a table at 2pm. Very popular place so either make reservations or go at an very unusual dining time....  We still talk about this place and definitely plan to go back next time in Vegas.",

But ever since we saw it, we visit it every year.  We should be making our annual trip soon...but figured I would review it so I can update it later with my Kobe experience.  I usually get the American Classic $12.75 Ridgefield farm beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun and that thing is delicious.    Or you can make your own and add topings as you wish.  This burger really hits the spot right before or during the draft.  Sometimes there is a wait as it is pretty popular.  I will have to revisit and update on how it tastes compared to the burger places I've been to in so cali....and I will try the kobe this year.",

I watched Giada on Food Network eat here a while ago, and ever since then I've had it at the back of my mind to check this place out.   I ordered an Angus beef burger on ciabatta bread, with toppings of carmelized onion and peppered bacon. All the ingredients tasted fresh and blended well together. If I had to nit pick, the ciabatta bread was a bit on the dry side. It was begging to be oven warmed or briefly toasted on the grill. But I was so hungry, there was no way that burger was leaving my grasp.   As for the sides, the crown jewel had to be the buttermilk dipped fried zucchini fries. Piping hot fresh zucchini interior, crispy not-too-heavy breading exterior, and nice seasoning. Dip it in some ranch sauce, and it was the perfect compliment to our burgers. We also had sweet potato fries, which was good as well, but didn't quite hold up a candle next to the zucchini fries.   Prices are reasonable, and service was efficient and friendly. Next time, I'll have to spring for the Kobe beef burger, with pepper jack cheese and grilled mushrooms. Yes, I've given it some thought. So if you're ever in the mood for a good burger in a casual atmosphere in Vegas, you'll know where to go.",

When \"most\" people think buffet they think all you can eat (ayce) and average food quality, right? Right; However, the reason I think buffet's are ever so popular and important to the epicurean theology is not because of the quantity but rather another keystone of the American English vernacular... FREEDOM.   Freedom is a very powerful \"gimmick\" restaurants employ [which we all fall victim too] to coerce patrons into thinking they are the captain, el presidente, la luchadora, and the head honcho of their own food eating destiny.  Breaking this nonscientific hypothesis down one begins to realize we have become a society filled of imaginative free thinking charlatan's [aka pansies] who scoff and laugh at menus containing such disclaimers as \"no substitutions!\" or \"additional fee's may apply\".  Many existentialists relate this chickenheartedness of linear movement to a consternation of structure and organization; similar to its analogous nature much like rusty shackles placed on man's progression towards lifes many possibilites.   Now, while many readers are thinking wtmfs (what the motha f'n shits) does this rambling of philosophical food mumbo jumbo have to do with patties of meat???? Well, its sets the stage and illustrates the progression and direction of culinary \"fast\" food by placating to society's wants and needs.  Why do you think the Chipotles, Yogurt Lands, and the Burger Bars of the world are becoming so popular? It's the freedom of choice and limitless possibilities all stemming from the belly busting buffet.   finally I digress....   Burger Bar is an A-OK place that provides almost limitless possibilities to feed your meat addiction. You pick the type of patty, Black Angus Beef, Kobe Beef, Colorado Lamb, turkey, and veggie. Then comes the different buns/breads. Then comes the toppings which each have their own subcategory like the Garden, Grill, Ocean, Dairy, Farm, Pantry, and Earth. Lastly you choose the fried goodies.   I can only speak based on my concoction. I got a lamb burger with spinach, cucumber, feta cheese, pesto sauce, and side of fried pickles. The burger was okay, outside the steep price tag, nothing was different than any of the other \"made to order\" burger joints. The fried pickles however were the best item. In honer of full disclosure however, if I didn't drop a couple of Benjamen's at the craps table while waiting to be seated the burger might have tasted a bit better. Just a smidgen though.   I was lucky enough to get a taste of my friends [the famous michelle t.] angus beef, foie gras, truffle burger and it was as heavy as a thanksgiving dinner at the klump's house. For $30+ it tasted amazing but probably would have put me to sleep and then a stomach ache had I eaten any more.   All in all, fun place, nice staff, good service, okay food, but a bit overpriced.",

It was sooo good!!  The meat was tender and juicy! mmmm yummmy!   My boyfriend got the buffalo burger and I think I like it more than the american kobe!  It was more tasty.    For sides we got the jalapeno friend pickles - yummmmy The sweet potato fries - a must get! The fried zucchini - for some reason, theirs were so good! And some onion rings - I can skip these next time  I love how they have burgers for the people who don't like to build their burgers and of course having the option of building your own burgers.  What else is cool is that you can even build your own milkshakes!! =)  I think this place is pretty awesome!  Both in the menu and the food!",

We went to the Burger Bar the next day for lunch and to my delight, it was \"phenomenal\". I had the Peppercorn burger. Yummy beef patties cooked medium rare with honey dijon, fresh peppercorn, lettuce, tomato on a plain white bun with a fresh and a yummy peppercorn sauce to top it all off!   Little did we know the restaurant was owned by Chef Hubert Keller. He also owns Fleur de Lys. Somewhere my friends and I have always wanted to try... it's just a bit $$$. There is a $60 burger you can try at Burger Bar. It is the Rossini burger. It is Kobe beef, american cheese, foie gras, and truffle shavings on an onion bun. Sounds like something to try next trip around!  Worth a visit. Next time Fleur de Lys or even Robuchon!",

On my most recent visit, I tried the buffalo burger on a whole wheat bun, and it was delicious!  I've had the Kobe and the black Angus burgers as well, and they are fabulous, too.  The skinny fries are always amazing.   My husband always orders the beer sampler-- they have a great selection on tap, and the sampler offers generous portions of any beers you wish to try.   My recommendation is that you get there a little early-- you'll probably have a 30-minute wait at about 6 on a Saturday, but if you get there later, you'll be waiting a while.  Oh, and bring a hearty appetite!",

But when I finally had a chance to eat here recently, I felt it was too indulgent to blow $60 for a burger! I opted for building my own burger instead that would be like Hubert's burger but with Kobe beef instead of buffalo. I think the watiress accidentally brought me the buffalo anyways because the meat was chewy.  Overall, I prefer Father's Office burger over this one...even if the meat had been juicy Kobe instead of tough dry buffalo.",

Even lunch during the week there was a line for groups, so go with a group no more than 4 to avoid the wait (isn't it always 4), there is also a long bar that you can grab a seat at.  The decor: think traditional diner turn the lights down, and throw some wood in place of shiny stuff.  The burger came out quickly and done right.  There are several chef burgers for you to choose from but than you can select your bun, your patty of choice, cheese, and any condiment you want.  But think carefully, for me: kobe beef so I went with the swiss because it is lighter in taste but salty and cheesy still, its a kobe buger so don't even think about putting some crazy topping that will overpower the meat.  I digress, the service was prompt, the burger was great, the sweet potato fries were good, the beers were cold.  Yeah, I will be back.",

Some might say it can be dry, but that is how i like my burgers... weird yeah. We had some sweet potato fries, small fries, and fried zucchini, can't go wrong with fried stuff, so no complaints there. Favorite was being able to choose what i wanted on my burger.... downfall, paying extra for the delicious toppings.

My boyfriend said, while half way through his burger \"it's not gone but i miss it already.\"   We had a party of 6, and we called in for reservations, they said it was going to be about an hour. No biggie, we're in Vegas, we passed time.   Three of us got the Kobe Beef burger: AMAZING. I was VERY skeptical about this meat. I really didnt understand the big deal. BOY WAS I WRONG. It was like steak in burger form. Oh lord. One of us got cinnamon bacon. Yes, i just said CINNAMON BACON. (They have many types: Black pepper, jalapeno bacon, cinnamon bacon, ..and i cant remember the other two)  Two of us got the Surf n Turf burger, with the lobster tail. They were in heaven. One of them got the shallot and wine reduction sauce, which she was VERY pleased with.  The last person got a veggie burger, sadly to say, i dont think she enjoyed it much. But c'mon, there's nothing better than real meat anyway.   There was very little conversation throughout dinner, which one of us had brought up, but we had decided it was due to the fact that everyone couldnt stop eating!  We got zucchini fries which were, absolutely delicious. They weren't super thick, nor super thin. The breading was crunchy, and herby, with the soft (yet firm) veggie inside.   As for the dessert burgers, eh, they were ok. Not needed, nothing to write home about.   The price can be anywhere from $12-60 per burger. It all depends on what you put on it of course (for example, lobster and black truffles will be hella expensive. Where as asparagus and pesto will be much cheaper.)  Go here. Get the Kobe beef. Enjoy. And sob endlessly when you've finished it. :D",

With both a vast beer and burger selection, you can come back again and again and not have the same thing for a year it seems.  You pick type of meat (or non-meat) you want in your burger, the kind of bun, and then start picking and chooseing from a laundry list of extras to pack on top of your patty.  It's all there, trust me.  They even have a few pre-packaged deals including one $60 burger.  They even had dessert burgers!  If you aren't going to be all that adventurous with your burger selection then you might be better off finding a burger joint that will let you have a plain cheeseburger for much less though.

But there are plenty of other items to pick from if you want to spend less or try something else.  You can build your burger however you see fit.  You get to pick not only your preferred cheese of course but also the type of bread and there are MANY toppings to pick from.  Not too many places let you put avocado on top of a burger.

Service for my table was excellent, really above average, even at this price point.  I was quite pleased. (Thanks Sergio.)  The concept here is elevating burgers, but the fundamental problem is it's a mashup of flavors, and trying load so many premium ingredients, well, they get lost.  And Wagyu?  Not to say beef selection doesn't matter, but the reasons wagyu commands a premium, doesn't make a difference here.  I'd give it 4* if not for the excesses in pushing brands.

    "text": "Came here with some friends before going to a concert. Burger Bar is located on the bridge/walkway that connects Mandalay Bay to the Luxor. They are pretty pricey for the food but it's on the Strip so that's to be expected.   We sat at the bar and had a wonderful server. I wish I asked for his name! He was attentive and gave opinions on what his favorite food items were on the menu.  I got the baguette burger (cooked medium) which came with melted truffle Brie cheese, tomatoes, onions, lettuce, and pickles. The words \"truffle\" and \"Brie\" is what made me order this dish. I was a little worried the baguette would be too hard but to my surprise, it wasn't at all! My burger was cooked perfectly. The meat itself didn't have a whole lot of flavor, however, the truffle Brie cheese made up for that. This came with skinny fries (my favorite) because their fries are more crunchy which is what I prefer.   If I had an event that's either at Luxor or MB, I would eat here again. It's a great restaurant to just chill, relax, and eat.",

You can even create your own shake with toppings, syrups and liquors. Everyone raved about the burgers. I didn't get to try one, but they looked and smelled amazing.

Each booth offers a small personal TV so you can watch sports which is awesome!  The menu only had a handful of specialty burgers that the kitchen creates, otherwise it is a build your own burger place. Everything is priced a la carte. I got the buffalo burger with pepper jack cheese and a spicy ketchup. Simple, but soo delicious. The burger patties are very thick and I highly suggest cutting it in half to eat it LOL they have so many different options for your side, I stuck to the skinny fries but the tater tots my boyfriend got were pretty tasty too.   I also had a lavender lemon drop martini that I would highly recommend. The prices are a bit high for burgers, but they are really amazing and this restaurant is located on the strip so expect everything to be expensive. We were in and out of the restaurant within 1 hour so it's a fairly quick dining experience which worked perfectly with our concert start time.",

I was surprised not too many in there to watch the NFL games. So I sat at the bar. I placed my order Kobe Beef Burger (~$18) Truffle Fries (~$8) and a beer. The guy who sat next to me placed his order 10 minutes after I did and his came out first. Had to track my waiter down just to check on my order. Even the guy sat next to me was shocked.   Back to the food. I had Kobe Beef burger before and this was not even close to it. Tasted more like regular plain beef. I should've just order the regular burger and save me some money. The truffle fries were ok. Nothing special. Next time I'm in Vegas I'll pass this place. Not worth the money. This place failed me and so does Yelp this time.",

With this in mind I figured Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay would have been a stone cold lock. Hundreds of beers to choose from, a masculine yet inviting interior, a packed house and even great bartenders had me sprung from the onset. In fact, I was seriously digging Burger Bar up to the point the Burger arrived!  I decided to try the \"Perfect Ten\" Burger which really was more like a Perfect 5. Maybe Vegas grades on a curve? Basically they put down a (perfectly cooked) medium rare patty and top it with Gouda Cheese, carmelized Onions and serve it on a dry and stale Pretzel bun. With exception of the bun, the ingredients were fresh enough and the Burger was juicy and bold, it is just that there was no \"pop\" factor for me and at $16.00 it should have all kinds of wonderful in every bite. Frustrating.  It being Vegas, I gambled big but lost in the flavor department. If you are going to drop some serious duckets on a Burger, I would suggest going elsewhere.",

We had already waited about an hour for lunch and I'm not the type to send things back so I ended up not eating most of it. My friend did end up sending back her burger since she requested it well done but it was still pink inside.  Overly long wait plus subpar food not cooked to order makes for a meh experience.",

Vast beer selection, something for everyone. Have a signature burger or build your own. The sliders are great if you can't decide. Not in the mood? Have a sandwich or salad. Cobb salad is spectacular. There's a few good options for kids, and menu is an activity page with crayons.  The onion rings and sweet potato fries are excellent. Can't comment on the desserts because we've never had room. Service is always very friendly.",

I was visiting out of town and two friends who live in Vegas brought me here.  They said we MUST try it.  GOOD CHOICE!  Their \"thing\" is that we must be intentional about \"building\" our sandwich.  Choose your: bun, the \"meat\", the cheese, the toppings, additions, sides, etc.  There is no \"pre grouped\" option, you build your meal from ground up.  I am 47 years old, and I have worked in hospitality for many years, and of course I have eaten in restaurants all of my life.  I have NEVER had a meal that was SO intentionally created and presented for me.  I could tell the placement of my two cheeses was precise, the placement of the burger on the bun was precise, the placing of the crown of the bun was precise... EVERYTHING was precise.  That made me appreciate it more.  The server was INCREDIBLE... never missed an opportunity to wow us with flair, friendliness, and refills.  Great job.  It will be a place I will re-visit when I am back in vegas... in a year or two... :)",

Anyways, got seated and I ordered the Hangover Burger, basically it was a burger with In N Out Spread so for $13, definitely not worth it. Replaced the fat fries with onion rings as well. Onion rings had way too much dough on it, could barely taste the onions themselves.   Anyways, looks like I learned my lesson, either order the $65 Rossini or make my own burger with foie gras and the Kobe wagyu beef. Will give this place another shot when I come back, but the wait time is just ridiculous.",

The Burger Bar is a casual place with pop music piping throughout the restaurant and sports on the millions of televisions they have.  Each booth has their own television for you to catch a game or two so you'll never miss a game.  It's clean and modern and just dimly lit enough for you to feel relaxed.    I had \"The American Classic\" while the dude-man had the \"Hubert Keller Burger.\"  Both were super delicious, hit the spot, and cooked to a perfect medium..  I really enjoyed the buffalo meat in the HK burger and that red wine and shallots sauce was crazy good.  I liked dipping my skinny fries in there.  My burger was crazy big while the HK seemed to be a smaller portion.  Is this normal?  It was my first time stopping by!  I had originally wanted to try the \"Spicy Lamb Burger\" but I was afraid it would be too spicy.  While Burger Bar isn't my burger place of choice on The Strip, I definitely wouldn't hesitate to stop in again!",

The restaurant is long and narrow and small.  It makes you realize why you have to wait.  The burger was tasty although it may not be the best of Vegas. Service was friendly.

They cook their burger to PERFECTION, and you'll never find another place with this quality of beef.   Not only is the beef perfect, but also their toppings.  You get to choose ANY topping you like on your burger.  I always get avocado with mozzarella and satuee portobello mushroom.  MMmmm, mummmm, mummm.  My stomach is growling just thinking about it.  On yeah, you also get to choose the type of bread you want around your burger.  I always choose ciabatta bread because it's mostly crust with little dough in side.  I'm weird, I always eat the outside of the bread, but not the inside.    Bottom line, if you're in Vegas, you gotta come here and try their burger.

The quality of beef was not as good as other places I've had burgers in Los Angeles. They have options like Wagyu and Kobe beef, as well as extravagant options like seared foie gras, though. So maybe if you get a burger with these ingredients, it would be better.   Their thin fries are only okay, but the white bbq sauce is amazing.  I recommend this place if you really want a burger, but it's not exactly an upscale burger restaurant, despite being priced like one. Perhaps the real attraction is the variety of liquor they pour.",

    "text": "Came here on my quest for foie gras. According to yelp, this is one of the most affordable places to find foie on the strip.   We walked up at 8pm on a Tuesday and found that it was a 45 minute wait for a table. However their bar seating goes all the way to the back of the restaurant (pretty long) and we were able to find seats at the end of the bar.   We ordered   Fried pepper jack \"shots\"/ breaded cheese balls that are breaded and fried. They were crisp and the cheese inside was soft but not too oozy. The flavor was solid but towards the end of the dish it became apparent that it was just cheese. I love cheese so for me that was a plus, but be prepared for a lack of flavor development.   \"Naturesource\" (I think free range) Patty, onion bun, carmelized onions, foie gras/ the foie gras add on was an extra $13, making this burger run around $26. I was splitting with my husband and they split the plates without us asking but then also charged us a $2 split plate fee.   The foie gras was about a third of a full one, which for $13 isn't bad. I actually removed it from my burger so I could taste it on its own. The patty was too thick for the foie.. I would recommend adding the truffle sauce ($5) as this dish was a little on the dry side without. The onions were carmelized beautyfully, and the patty was perfectly cooked.  I would return.",

I got the Kobe burger with grilled onions, Swiss and truffle mayo. A side of fries too. Hoping for a treat.  The burger looked good, was huge but the taste was bland. I added the truffle mayo which was the clear highlight of the meal. That mayo also saved the fries which were just okay. Got a much better burger on the strip at Fat burger for half the price earlier in the week. Season your burgers better.",

    "text": "During our last trip to Vegas my husband and I had dinner at the Burger Bar.  We arrived and a friendly hostess told us that it would be a 15 minute wait.  It was a Friday night and it was very busy.  We were seated in about 10 minutes.  We were seated in a cozy booth that had it's own TV with sports on.  Our server was friendly and came to our table quickly to get us drinks.  Burger Bar is build your own burger.  They have excellent choice to make a burger for every palate.  My husband order the Kobe beef burger with Pepper Jack Cheese, Avocado, and Bacon.  He also order a side of their Fat fries.  He thought the burger was one of the best he has had and was cooked perfectly to order. He said the Fries were just above average. I order the Chef's Veggie Burger with smoked gouda, Avocado, peppers and Asparagus and their Aioli with a side of sweet potatoes fries.  The veggie burger was very tasty! I also would have to say one of the best Veggie burger I've had. The sweet potato were great.  It was an excellent meal overall.   My husband and I share a Oreo Shake for dessert. It was a great treat to end our meal. We will definitely be returning to the Burger Bar during our next trip to Vegas. I highly recommend the burger bar for dinner before a night on the strip!",

    "text": "Ok... so mixed feelings on this place.  I like the burgers... I like that they accomodate group parties with pre-determined menus ... and I like that they assign big groups 2 servers and multiple bussers.   However... I don't like that it's so freakin' loud in there and that the set up (flow of tables and traffic pattern) is NOT efficient or easy to maneuver. You have to squeeze around tables, chairs and people to get through the place and then dodge the servers and the bussers who have trays of food/plates.  I enjoyed the Buffalo Burger with Zucchini fries. Buffalo Burger was juicy and meaty and lean.  So good!  The bun was a bit too thick for me so I only ate one side.... the zucchini fries had too much batter for me. I would prefer a lighter batter... and more zucchini... rather than the other way around.    I saw the Cobb Salad and it was BIG... and it looked really good.  Yes... I'll be back to try other items on the menu.... might be better to go during the week when it might not be as crowded.",

When we approached the desk, they all just looked at us and didn't greet us. They actually even looked irritated that we interrupted them. How dare we ask them to work at their job!My husband went ahead and requested a table which was going to be 30-45 minutes. Meanwhile I went to the Slice of Vegas hostess desk to inquire how long a table might be and the women working there actually had sunny dispositions and looked like the enjoyed being at work so we ate there. I would consider trying Burger Bar again as long as they don't have stuck up b!tches working at the front.",

Service: - the hostesses and the server were all pretty cool  - food took a lot longer than it should have to come out  Food: - American Kobe Burger - Not Good. on the menu, this sounds really good, and it better be if they're charging 17 goddamn dollars for it. Ordered ours medium with American cheese. The reason the food took so long to come out was because the kitchen was burning it to an effing crisp! It would have been overdone even if it was ordered \"well done\". They also charged $2 to cut it in 1/2 and bring it out in two plates even though we didn't ask 'em to. The burger we had from room service the night before was a lot better. Pretty much any burger I've had in the last few years (including fast foods) s**ts on this burger. - Fry Sampler (Fat Fries, Sweet Potato Fries, Onion Rings) -  Very Good. Only used ketchup and ranch to dip. Probably the best fat fries I've ever had. Onion Rings were really impressive too. Sweet Potato fries were good, but not my thing.   Misc: - Nice setup, the booths have their own tv in the wall - Your burger doesn't include fries on the side, you have to order that separately - I was planning on coming back for the Buffalo Burger (that costs more than the Kobe), but after they fumbled our burger tonight....I'm not wasting my time/money here again.",

Seriously, the food came out room temperature  (at best ), the fries were soggy to the point of almost being undercooked. My husband ordered provolone on his & it came with no cheese. I ordered very light bleu cheese on mine and it had about a quarter cup piled on it.  The soda he ordered was diet  (which he hates) so they couldn't even get our beverage order correct. Worse of all, we both ordered our burgers medium-well and they were rare to the point that we couldn't even eat around the edges.  Not even juicy, lacked flavor and served on a cold potato bun made me actually lose my appetite.  Usually I love aeoli but theirs was so garlicky I had to mix it with the mayonnaise that we also had to request just so I could dip the pathetic fries in it. I did eat the tomato, the modest little slice that was served on the side.  Honestly, it made me not want another burger any time soon!  Epic fail!",

    "text": "All you need to know: THE BEST SKINNY FRIES I HAVE EVER HAD IN MY LIFE. EVER.  Perfectly cut, not greasy, perfectly salted, crunchy outside, soft hot inside. I ate every last one and I could have eaten more.  So it is no secret that I love Hubert Keller.  I have the hugest crush on him with his French accent, charming smile, and gray ponytail.  And I don't typically crush on older men, that's a fact.  I also love how he's always adorably sweet and encouraging on the Top Chef shows.  And his PBS shows make it look easy to make souffle...yeah, right, but he makes it look easy.  So we went to Burger Bar after an unintended visit to the airport to retrieve my BF's lost ID.  Ugh.  This place looks like an updated more upscale diner with booths, tables, and bar seating.  Get your fave type of seating and get ready to stuff yourself!  Burgers are either \"build your own\" or Chef's burgers that are already designed with toppings, etc.  They even have veggie burgers and fish burgers so if you don't like beef you are still going to find something here.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger that was buffalo meat with caramelized onions, baby spinach and bleu cheese on a ciabatta with red wine and shallots sauce.  If it is good enough for Hubert it is good enough for me.  The burger was perfectly medium rare and the entire thing was messy and dripping with savory juices from the sauce and the caramelized onions. It was delicious...and huge!  I didn't finish the entire thing but that may have been because I stuffed my face with fries.  The BF got the lamb burger.  This one is with secret spices, tomato, cilantro, and spicy burger bar ketchup.  It had a great spice taste, like Middle Eastern inspired flavor.  And the spicy ketchup - that is the stuff.  We ordered a separate order of that for our fries.  Not that the fries needed ketchup but damn that ketchup was good.  I cannot stress enough how good those fries were.  I am a huge fan of skinny fries, crunchier the better, and dear God they were amazing.    If you don't want burgers, they do have salads and a chicken sandwich too.  They also have milkshakes, including BOOZY milkshakes.  If ONLY I had enough room for one of those too.    Service was good, our waitress was attentive and didn't let us go thirsty.  She also answered that Chef Keller was not there that weekend and told me I could keep up with his whereabouts (i.e. stalk him more effectively) on facebook.  She confirmed that he is a sweet guy just like I already knew.  The prices are pretty standard Vegas if you ask me which means it isn't gonna be the cheapest burger...mine was $22 if that tells you.  And the ketchup extra was $1.  But hey, that's how it goes.  Next time you are in Vegas and want a casual atmosphere and a damn fine burger and the best fries EVER you need to come here.",

    "text": "I like to say that I am a sweet potato addict. If it is on the menu... I always order it.   This place probably has the best sweet potato fries! They also have really good burgers (Which would make sense since they are a Burger joint). I have had their Surf and Turf Burger ... which is really good.... but I havent had another surf n turf burger to compare to.   But anyone who goes here has to try their Hubert Keller burger! They use a Ciabatta bread for the bun and it is a buffalo burger. My cousin tried it (who is a big burger fan)... and he thought it is one of the best burgers he had ever had. You have to go try it for yourself!  And as for dessert, I personally recommend their Chocolate Burger (which is made with donut for the buns, and some type of nutella and chocolate center for the patty). I only recommend this if you truly have a sweet tooth. But for those who just want a bit of sweetness added to their palate, I would recommend their Sundae Trio. This has a great balance of sweetness to your burger meal.",

    "text": "Not worth it.  Period.  Full stop.  End of discussion.  Saying this is an alternative to Fleur is like saying that a Hyundai with \"Ferrari\" spray painted on the hood is an alternative to a fine Italian automobile.  I was fully prepared to love this place.  Had the $60 burger.  Was with a companion that ordered the second most expensive burger.  Had a couple sides/appetizers.  Again, not worth it.  The $60 burger is very good, but it's worth more like $25 or $30.  Most everything else?  Typical diner fare.  When I'm at a place that serves a 60 dollar burger, and numerous 16-23 dollar burgers, I don't expect to get appetizers out of a food service of America bag, but that's exactly what I got.  Mozzarella sticks at BB should not be the same ones you get at Denny's for 5 dollars. Period.  Eff this place.  If you want to be upscale, be upscale.  If you want to be a Denny's alternative, be a Denny's alternative.  Mixing and matching the two is just deception.  It's BS.  That's why this place sucks, and I'll never go there again.",

    "text": "Well I'm so sad to say that my last trip to Burger Bar was just average.  We stayed at the Palazzo and we walked all the way down (over 4 miles round trip) to eat here.   The food has changed or at least I went on an off night.  First, my favorite zucchini \"fries\" are now generic zucchini strips.  The kind you find at most pizza places. They were thicker than before and not \"fry\" like at all.  I was super bummed.  They weren't terrible, they were just like the frozen kind a lot of restaurants use.  Second, my veggie burger was not so good.  It started to fall apart after my first bite.  The bun soon joined and I had a complete mess on my plate.  The bun was almost stale in my opinion.  The hostesses were awesome but our waitress was ok.  It was a Thursday night so it wasn't super busy or anything.  I don't know what happened to my beloved Burger Bar but I can tell you that I won't be making the trek down there anymore.  If I happen to walk by I might step in but I doubt it.",

The place is fun and good for groups, they have a wide selection of good beer and the burgers are gourmet burgers. The surf and turf was interesting; I didn't think I would enjoy a burger like that, but surprisingly, they pulled it off well. The onions rings were really great and so were the skinny fries.  I felt the food was a bit overpriced, but overall, the potions were healthy and Mandalay Bay is a high end casino, so it was expected.",

The waitresses seem sometimes like they have too many tables but are friendly.  I've never eaten at the bar here.  Price- When you're on the strip keep in mind that EVERYTHING is pricey!!!  If you don't like it head off the strip!!!  Actually, relative to other offerings on the strip and considering portion size, this place is actually a good deal (for the strip).    I live in Vegas and took my Mom here a few days ago so i'll post from her perspective.    Mum- Sliders - Raved about them rest of the day.  Brother - Angus Burger.  He loved it, said it was the best lunch he's had in a long time.  We shared the Nutella  shake and the sweet potato fries.  We all agreed the shake was the best we've ever had (i'm not a big sweet guy but this was the bomb).  I no longer eat red meat and had the Turkey burger which wasn't bad as well :)  In summary, don't avoid this place because people say it's over-priced.  It isn't for the strip, and I go out of my way as a local to eat here.  People I bring here think it's great and I have friends in town that have had their birthdays here.  Comparing it to fast food or saying fast food is better makes me LOL",

I had originally ordered the truffle sauce, but it came without the truffle sauce, but instead came with truffle mayo.  My server realized the mistake, and apologized and said that she would make the correction to my bill.   didn't mind since the truffle mayo was excellent.  The burger was fine (not sure I'd go with the kobe again since I didn't notice that much of a difference from a regular beef burger).  Foie gras was nice addition.  Sweet potato fries were very good too.  Ordered a caramel milk shake after lunch which was very good too, but killed my appetite for my dinner a Sage later that day.  Not sure I'd make Burger Bar a destination, but if you're nearby, I'd recommend it for a burger.  Service was very attentive.",

I can't remember the name of the burger but the sauce tasted just like a Big Mac. The burger itself was smaller then I would have liked. The fries were seasoned and delicious. I had a martini that was shaken but when poured had some ice in the glass. No big deal I took it out. Service was great at first but getting our check was a chore it seemed like.

This was one of the first design-your-own-burger places I ever encountered, but of course now other places with the same concept are all over the place. However, this one is still doing it on a grand scale and better than any other I've run across. There are such vast selections of meats, breads and toppings that anyone can find something that can become their perfect burger. For me, it's bison meat on ciabatta with bleu cheese, spicy mustard, caramelized onions and spinach. With a side of shoestring sweet potato fries, of course. Oh, and a flight of IPAs from their massive beer selection. Service is always incredibly friendly and these folks know the menu options well. It's almost always crowded and there's often a wait for a table, but I've had good luck stalking the bar and grabbing empty seats there.",

    "text": "This place is a joke! Unfortunately this place was recommended to me by a friend in Tucson, AZ that said that this was the place to go for burgers.   He couldn't have been farther from the truth. This place is nothing but a burger assembly line. The burger I had came to me with slightly burnt caramelized onions which threw off the entire taste of the burger I got. I flagged down the waitress and told her it was no good. Even another person at the table that got the caramelized onions thought the same thing. The waitress had me wait for the \"manager\" to come out and remedy the situation. His name was \"Scott\", and he had to be the most unprofessional manager I have ever experienced, he stated because I have taken two bites out of my burger that I am responsible for the bill, but he would gladly make another. After I told him I refused to pay for a burger that wasn't as advertised with burnt onions, he argued that this was policy. I told him, thats fine but if you want to charge me for some food that I refused to eat because it was amateur and sub par that he would have to call the authorities in order to get me to pay! The whole table that I was with was not only blown out of the water but was embarrassed, He offered to take only 1/3 of the cost of the meal off the bill and offered me a choice of kolbe beef sliders. I finally agreed still blown away that he was fighting this so hard. He comes back to me and tells me that they are out of kolbe beef so they prepared regular burger sliders for me! It was at that time only about 9PM on a friday night. If this place has run out of Kolbe Beef on a Friday night, than it has no right calling itself the Burger Bar! My deduction, he didn't want to give me kolbe beef sliders! Either way, not a win for this place!  Lets summarize: 1. Bad food 2. Poor Service 3. Fight from the manager 4. Embarrassment from the manager 5. Lies from the manager 6. The most pathetic sliders I have ever seen  The sliders came back to us with no condiments just dry beef on 3 buns and nothing to write home about!  I was \"REQUIRED\" to pay for food I did NOT eat, I fought with the \"manager\", and I got a super sub par Slider as a sorry we suck gratitude!  Overall this place and its manager are so full of shit that I will avoid this place at all costs, and recommend some of the more local places or even other chain places that will have better food, or management that can see that someone made a mistake, and make it right!   Steer Clear! Scott your a D bag! how you got your job is beyond me! Public, just know that I am a yelp Elite, and that I wouldn't steer you wrong! This place gets an F for Effen Horrible!",

A past coworker of mine at the last last huge company I worked for always wanted to eat here, every effing night whenever he was in Vegas. We were always in LV for tradeshows (CES, Interop) for a good 8-12 days at a time so I guess a good burger, nice cold glass of beer and stellar service is key, especially when you're basically \"living\" in a town filled with AIDs spreading peeps and cancer-inducing gamblers. Ew!  I've had their veggie burger and another burger off the menu that I really can't seem to remember at this moment. I remember the veggie burger being very juicy, the fries were mehhh and my beer was gettin me real nice and buzzed that first work night we were there for CES. :)  We sat at the counter each time we ate there and the bartenders/servers are very friendly and efficient. They better be, cuz this place always seems packed with people!  Would I return here? Hmmmm, if I was really craving a Kobe burger (which is like their most popular burger), then maybe I'll finally try one out. But there are TONS of other amazing dining spots in Vegas to try out and I do plan to attack at least 50% of all the great ones before I lose my teeth and I'm shufflin' around with a walker.",

    "text": "An awesome alternative to dropping mad duckets at Fleur de Lis if you would like to experience Hubert Keller's food.  This place rocks about 6 of their own signature burgers which I find to be kind of low for a Celebrity Chef. With a chef of this caliber I would have loved to have seen more options. I love the idea of having choices, but sometimes can use the guidance of a professional... especially a known professional.  You also have the option of completely designing your own burger from the buns, to the meats, to the cheeses, and to the toppings.  Your meats range anywhere from your everyday 80/20 blend of ground beef all they way up to American Kobe which is a delicious blend of Black Angus Beef and Japanese Wagyu Beef. Since it's not actual Japanese Kobe Beef one can experience the next best thing next to the original for a fraction of the cost!  I'm not really a gamblin man so dropping $25 bucks on a great Cheeseburger is no big deal for me... and the experience last longer than how quickly I don't achieve 21!  I've been here a couple of times, but an example of one of the burgers I constructed was this: American Kobe Beef Patty, tender Grilled Onions, an Over Easy Egg, crispy delicious Bacon, American Cheese, and a perfectly balanced BBQ Sauce with Sweet Potato Fries. I found this combination most mouth watering and delicious that had my eyes rolling in the back of my head in pure culinary ecstasy. The burger was smooth and juicy and was complemented exquisitely by the other components of this burg!  I just couldn't bring myself to giving them a perfect score because some \"Amuse Douche\" server that was working on that visit just made my entire visit simply horrible. He was arrogant, argumentative, and his facial expressions were appalling. Someone definitely woke up on the wrong side of the bed that morning in turn leaving (pun intended) a bad taste in my mouth.  Decor inside is modern and warm.  The word is out on this place as there is always a line, but it is definitely worth the wait.",

She led me down the right path to a delicious juicy burger and garlic fries, just what I needed to satiate my late Vegas breakfast hunger. They have everything there from a $65 foie gras topped burger, to an $11 build your own burger right down to what kind of bun you want. And tons of different toppings. I built my burger with a pretzel bun, angus beef, smoked gouda, peppered bacon, grilled onions, and avocado. YUM! It was so big I had to smash it to fit into my mouth. It was so damn good! I chose the skinny fries for my side and to my surprise they were full of garlic chunks and didn't really need any dipping sauce. I ordered garlic aioli and wound up putting it on my burger, since there wasn't anything but butter on the bun.   If I was to stay in the vicinity again I'd eat here again for sure!",

The skinny fries, on the other hand, were salted nicely and cooked perfectly - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside.   The bar, TVs, and skimpy waitresses did give the place a somewhat confused vibe (since it also has an aspiring upscale burger joint feel to it).

I had the trio mini sliders which were accompanied with a side of fries. Each burger had its own little spin-- one classic, one with bacon, and one buffalo! Each one was unique enough to stand on its own. Even after finishing all of them, I could still recollect what each one tasted like individually, and that's the whole point, right?  All my friends were satisfied with their burgers too. I have to say that the fries were cooked nicely, but they weren't anything special. In the end, it's a three-star because I think one, the burger could have been more juicy, and two, there are other burgers that deliver on the same price and budget.",

However, the highlight was their skinny fries with garlic aioli sauce. Not to mention, this place is by renowned chef, Hubert Keller. Overall this place was delicious and I must-go-to place if you're in Vegas.",

Honestly, I probably would never eat here if it wasn't for the Nutella milkshake and I kept talking about it all weekend that we ended up going there twice~  Service was good on both visits but the hostess won't sit anyone until the whole party arrives so that was a tad annoying.   I tried: Nutella Milkshake - amazing!!! The nutella was prominent and it was plain addictive. Pretty huge for one person, best to share since nutella is quite sweet Strawberry Banana Shake - pretty darn tasty, surprisingly light for a shake and not overly sweet Cookie dough Shake - Not my favourite, had chunks of cookie dough with most of it blended in. Just like a light chocolate doughy shake  Lamb Burger - Well seasoned, a little gamey with a nice kick from the spices. Not bad but not my favourite. Salmon Burger - Amazing. The salmon fillet came looking like a patty (round) which was a tad alarming BUT it was just cut that way. Fresh and cooked a little rare in the middle, which was fine for us. I had it with a side of aioli n on a potato bun (both were delish). Zucchini fries were disappointing though.  Definitely be back since they open late, so we were able to go for a quick snack & nutella fix~",

The burger was cooked perfectly medium and it was moist and tender like nothing I have ever tasted. Now I wish I would have gotten the Kobe beef, I know it would have been incredible.  The restaurant has sports playing, in the booths you have a personal TV which is pretty cool.  One thing to definitely try next time is their flight of beer floats-that is right, BEER floats!! They do a float with Guinness and coffee ice cream. I can only imagine how tasty that is.",

This last time, I got a Kobe Beef Burger (oooooh tender) with, Blue Cheese, Jalapeno Bacon, caramelized onions, button mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, all on a onion bun! MMmmmmmm!!!!   So, the way this place works is you pick your bun (Onion, Wheat, White, Sesame), your meat (Turkey, Buffalo, Beef, Kobe Beef, and Veggie, your cheese (swiss, provolone, blue cheese, cheddar, american, etc.), bacon (peppered, jalapeno, regular, smoked), your onions (raw, caramelized sauteed, grilled), mushrooms (portabella, button, etc), you can even add black truffle oil or a fried egg! The selection here in regards to toppings is amazing, you can build your own amazing burger to your own taste.   This place is always packed and seems as though they don't have enough payroll to sustain the amount of people. Our waiter was all over the place, and was having a hard time keeping up with all of the tables.   Burger Bar is located in between Mandalay Bay and The Luxor.   This is somewhere I would return again!",

    "text": "The brilliantly innovative and sometimes crazy mind of Hubert Keller decided to step away from the fancy, upscale French eateries and create a..... burger joint?  It's True, and if you've been here before, you should also know it's DELICIOUS.    Located inside Mandalay Bay's \"Mandalay Place\" (their shopping center) - this burger joint is almost always crowded and buzzing with people.   We came here on a weekday around 3pm thinking that would be a good time to come and get a table right away.  We were wrong.  We still ended up waiting for almost 20 minutes to get a table but since we had been here before and knew what awaited us, we would've waited an hour.    The last time we were here, we ordered the Rossini Burger ($60), which is Burger Bar's most famous and most talked about burger.  You get a 1/3lb. of American Kobe beef (which is nothing compared to the original Japanese beef, but it's still pretty tasty) topped with sauteed foie gras (duck fat) and shaved black truffles on an onion bun.  OMFG!  They have four different kind of fries you can order.  Skinny, Fat, Sweet Potato or Zucchini.  We have tried all of them and our favorites are the sweet potato and the fat fries!  If you order the Rossini Burger, you get a \"sweet burger\" after your meal.  We ordered the Creamy Cheesecake Burger - the buns are actually a glazed donut that's been sliced in half, there's a patty made of cheesecake and then there's a caramelized pineapple slice on top of it.  It was freakin' amazing!    Service was excellent and when we told the waitress we were splitting the Rossini between the two of us, she brought us two separate plates, each with a huge half of the Rossini burger, and each with their own order of sweet potato fries!  Very nice!    Not all the burgers are this expensive, mind you.  You can still get a Kobe burger without the foie gras and truffles for about $20.  I've also tried their \"Surf and Turf Burger\"($25), which has a 1/3lb. of Black Angus beef topped with a grilled half lobster and grilled asparagus.  It doesn't come close to the Rossini burger in taste, but it's still a pretty delicious and decadent burger!    This restaurant has become a regular destination for us whenever we're in Vegas.  My wife insists we HAVE to get a burger at Burger Bar.    Pros:  Rossini burger! Four different kinds of fries!  Great service!  Outstanding food in general.  Cons:  it's almost always busy, but what can you expect?",

    "text": "This place is very similiar to The Counter as you can build your own custom burger.  In some sense it is better in that you can choose the type of beef (I got Kobe but more on that later), but there is slightly less choices on the other toppings (though still a lot compared to most other places). I really enjoyed the place, nice american bar-y atmosphere but not too crowded, and a short wait for lunch. Moroever the burger did not ge me overstuffed, which is a bonus as I hate wasting quality food and don't like to pack stuff to go.   This time around I got the Kobe patty with American and Chedder cheese, plus bacon, grilled onions, and truffles all topped with an onion bun. For sides I got the sweet potato fries, also ate normal fries, but regardless they were nothing to rave about. As for the Kobe patty, well you can't really beat Kobe (WARNING: it is American Kobe not real Japanese Kobe) when it comes to beef do undoubtly it was good. But really I think it is a waste to put such prime meat into a burger. Don't get me wrong if McDonalds served it for cheap I would get it all the time but for 20 bucks mmmmmmhhhh iono.  Definitely a chill place that I would visit again even if it was just to grab a beer and a burger. Next time I think I will be trying the beer floats.",

    "text": "Craft beer and burgers, a winning combination.  The Burger Bar in Las Vegas has done a great job of mixing the two.  Our first visit to Burger Bar was exactly one year ago to date - and it was probably one of our best Las Vegas STRIP experiences ever.  Before we knew about Aces and Ales - we always figured craft beer in Vegas was a bust.  As a last ditch attempt on our LV craft beer journey, I decided to do some research on yelp.  Did it exist?  Luckily fellow yelpers were able to direct me to Burger Bar.   At first we weren't sure what to think - my first concern was that being a Hubert Keller restaurant, it would be extremely expensive (sure, his food is amazing and restaurants are to die for, but only on very special occasions!)  My second concern was it's location on the strip.  I wasn't quite sure what we'd be in for.  Luckily, my fiance, who refers to my trip preparation as \"research,\" trusts my recommendations, so we took a chance.  We were pleasantly surprised.  It's a really cute restaurant, with more of a pub vibe.  Although their logo is  a martini glass with \"Burger Bar\" on it, they have much more than cosmos and appletinis.  We were very happy to see Dogfish Head 90 Minute on tap (NOT 60, but 90) at a very reasonable price.  They also had a decent bottle selection, keeping in mind that we were in Vegas and weren't even expecting to see Sierra Nevada on tap.  They also had their local brew and a few others that were impressive.   Nothing rare, but still more than decent.  We had been back to Vegas since then, but had never made the effort to head towards that side of the strip.  Fast forward a year later.  Our 2nd Annual Labor Day trip, we decided to hit Burger Bar since we were already at Mandalay Bay for a concert at the House of Blues.  We first arrived at 8PM and it was packed. No seats at the bar (our preferred seating of choice - easier access to the bartenders :)  and there were a TON of people waiting for a table.  We decided to head to Mix for a beverage and stop by on our way back to see if anyone had left.  Sure enough - 9PM on a Sunday - we found two perfect spots at the bar!  Timing is everything.  Dogfish Head 90 Minute was again on tap - 9oz for $5 - pretty good for a 9% beer!  Then I saw Lagunitas Lucky 13 on tap - 9 oz for $4.50.  I really couldn't pass that up!  We ordered rounds of beer, and my fiance and I decided to split the Surf & Turf burger (a burger with lobster and asparagus- $24.00) - surprisingly - soo good, with fries and an order of their Jalapeno Fried Pickles.  The burger was awesome, the fries were crispy and flavorful, (not burnt) and the fried pickles were probably my favorite.  I know people who say anything deep fried is better, and I normally try to avoid that motto like the plague.  But I was glad I tried these. A hint of jalapeno in the light batter, and the clean, fresh flavor of the pickles took away that greasy aftertaste you normally get from fried food.  They did split up our order (they cut our burger up and separated the fries for us).  We noticed after that there is a $2.00 split fee, which didn't bother us - but worth mentioning in case you are thinking of sharing.  The crowd is extremely eclectic.  A variety of college kids, older couples, younger couples, families...and it was busy - even on a Sunday night (although it was Labor Day weekend so that's expected).  Almost a little too busy and loud for us.  Although casual, it's anything but a dive.  The service was super friendly and nice (which is one thing that had stuck out for us the first time around).  Higher end burger shops and gastro pubs seem to be the trend wherever we go nowadays - Burger Bar is definitely one of the better ones.  I only give it four stars because it's probably not somewhere we would frequent if we lived in LV.  It is a little pricey, and the ambience is a little noisy and cluttered. I will say that Burger Bar is consistent - even a year later we had the same great experience.  Nothing much had changed, but I guess if it ain't broke don't fix it.  Worth checking out - especially if you enjoy beers and burgers!",

I had a buffalo burger and my, oh my, was it juicy and melt in your mouth!  Buffalo being a lean meat, that's no small feat.  I'd be hard pressed to move away from such a delicious burger on a future visit!  On said visit, I'll definitely want to save room for a sweet burger.",

You can choose to build your own burger with any kind of beef, bun, cheese, sauce and toppings. These burgers are huuugggeeee, and they're so so so good.   Skinny fries, Fat fries, Zucchini fries, sweet potato fries , onion rings. Yes!  It's a modern and hip burger bar with tv's in every booth playing sports and whatnot. The staff are all young and sexy, most are full of tattoos. This place has a kind of sporty, rock n roll, biker, badass vibe to it.  The bar of course sells any kind of drink and has a long list of the different beers on draft. They are also famous for their alcoholic shakes, which is a sweet way to get drunk.",

    "text": "What an awesome find!!! In the middle of a shopping \"mall\" inside the Mandalay Bay hotel.  Ok, so this is one of those places that have one expensive burger ($60 rossini burger). No, that's not the one I tried although I'm thinking next time I might, just to see what a $60 burger taste like.  Anyway, we walked in and they sat us down right away. This is a very casual place, nothing extremely fancy. It's an upscale bar, very cool, looks like a great place to grab a drink, grab a bite and hang out.  We decided to split the Hubert Keller burger (his favorite according to the menu). The burger meat is buffalo and it comes with caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. It was pure heaven! The meat is very tasty and the bread is delightful. This comes with a side of skinny fries which we swapped for sweet potato fries and they were fantastic. This plate of one burger and a side of fries comes at a whopping $19.25. But we split it between two people and it was enough to fill us up.  O.K, are you ready? NUTELLA milkshake!! Did you hear me? I said, NUTELLA milkshake!! Ohh, vanilla ice cream blended with lots of nutella topped with homemade whipped cream topped with hazelnuts and a drizzle nutella. What a dream!!! I know they make this at some other places but this one is the BEST so far.",

We made a trip out here from the Venetian, and it was nice seeing the casino and the mall, but I'd say it's not worth the hike just for the burgers. I didn't try the $60 kobe beef burger though, why ruin kobe beef by grinding it up and sticking it between two pieces of bread? We went for dinner and the wait was about 30 minutes or so for a table, but we had a group of 10 with us.   The awesome thing about this place is the fries!! Well, not really the fries (I think I tried the entire menu of fires), but the SAUCES!! We got a sauce sampler and they were all REALLY, really good, even just the standard aioli.  The place is casual and is a sports bar, serving beers, liquor, etc. Stop by if you're in the area. Skip if you're not around.",

I need to go back and try the Kobe beef burger as the black angus burger that Kacey ordered was nothing to go crazy about and the Burger Bar sliders were good but just not worth the price. Onion rings, zucchini fries and sweet potato fries were all delicious. Skinny fries were ok. Not a fan of places that nickel and dime you for every topping either, but I guess they are just trying to get you to order their specialty burgers.",

The star should be the American Kobe (Snake River Farm beef) but I hate eating luke-warm burgers and soggy fries. Perhaps my Kobe burger would have been much tastier with seared foie gras and truffle but $60 is a big jump from $16. This is just not the environment for me to spring $60 on a sandwich and risk it being served warm. For now, I think I'll stick to Flemming's prime bacon burgers for $6 during happy hours. AND  it comes with better fries!",

RE: the joint nice place, very random songs playing, i mean one min you hear babyface and the next you are listening to shiela e... lol.. various beers on tap i like the idea of building your own burgers, cuz i am picky and dont enjoy mustard or pickles on my burger. i decided to get the angus beef. i didnt throw in hella shit in it cuz i just wanted to taste it and i figured that i could always build more the following meal... BUT last min i couldnt help but throw in the portobella mushrooms.   my bf is a vegetarian and got the veggie burger, basically 2 'bello mushrooms and hella grilled veggies in the middle. he got a few extra grilled veggies to throw in side.   RE: the food so our food arrives and first of all, the only thing in the bun is the burger itself. the 1 slice of tomato and the 1 slice of lettuce is off to the side with the pickle ooozing its juice all over my bun and sweet potato fries. i have to give them credit for the abundance of mushroom. my angus pattie is HELLA tiny compared to the bun. i'm not a fan of bread so the less i eat it the better. so we throw our burgers together and the angus was tasty but a bit on the dry side. i did enjoy my sweet potato fries. i enjoyed the cheesecake burger too. i'd go back for those 2 things alone and not spend $13 on a burger. i ate every gawd daym thing and wasnt stuffed... theres something wrong with that... cuz normally i always walk away like the state puff marshmallow man....   RE: the service there was no mayo, the katsup and mustard were empty and i placed the katsup bottle upside down at the end of the table and 8 people walked by and didnt bother to refill it. the waiter forgot the extra shit my bf ordered and didnt really check up on us. the server was lucky i ended my meal on a good note with that daym cheesecake or else i would have stiffed him....",

I'd still rather go to the Apple Pan in Los Angeles, but this place is definitely up there. I was especially happy with the hostess.  There was a 40 minute wait when we got there.  We didn't want to wait so our party sat and ordered at a few open seats the bar had.  We saw a few tables open up about 10 minutes later and no one sat at those tables.  I asked the hostess if we could sit there and she initially told me that if we had already ordered at the bar we had to stay and eat there..house rules.  She then went to talk to her manager and in a few minutes we were in a booth.  what more can I say than...Niiiiiice!",

The place is pretty easy to find, being positioned in the mall between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.   The service and food are very good and there is a great selection of burgers.   The only reasons I would give for the Burger Bar not getting higher marks are that despite booking for 8pm, we were waiting another 20mins before we could be seated. I guess that is a good sign for the food, being such a popular place!   Also, bear in mind that the burgers are not cheap - especially by US standards - they do have foie gras and kobe beef burgers on the menu, but as an afficionado, I would say that these ingredients don't always make the best burgers.   There is a good choice of beers on tap.   All in all, very good burgers. Pricey. Make sure you book a table in advance",

But the Burger Bar somehow manages to fold the essence of excess into a place that is casual and cool, comfortable with what it is without the need for dancing waters or gold leaf bathroom fixtures.   The concept of the burgers are somewhat build your own, so you can get virtuous with your order if you want. Or you can go all-in with the Kobe, double orders of shoestrings and hell, they'll probably top the whole thing with gold leaf if you ask nicely. It is Vegas, after all.   What I like most about the Burger Bar is that, although it is a casual, relatively quick eatery, it is owned by one of America's best chefs and one who cares about ingredients. The same attention goes into food quality here as it does in a Michelin starred place. So, if you want to eat the same quality of food as the upper crust, just get it served on a bun, I think you'll enjoy this place.",

The sweet potato fries are always great and I tried the zucchini fires which were good- but I didn't need a whole plate of them. I ordered the Foie Gras on one of my burgers ( I love foie gras) and probably would not order it again at burger bar- it was rubbery, unseasoned and just blah.   The kobe burgers at burger bar are the way to go- SUPER juicy and meaty tasting. I've had kobe burgers other places, but Burger Bar's are the best. My fav burger- kobe beef, blue cheese, caramelized onions and bacon on a sesame bun- perfection!",

You really couldn't get any sense of him putting his finger into the place with it looking like any other sports bar in the entire world. Sure you can get foie or lobster on your burger but it just doesn't have the finesse that you might expect from a chef like him.  Overall its a good burger bar with TVs in each of the booths. and plenty of taps of beers to choose from. You can basically create your own sampler of beers which will range from $2-$6 each depending on which beers you actually pick. The burgers can be built to order with basically anything available for you to add on to.  As sides i tried their Fried Cheese (love them, reminds me of denny's), and Zucchini fries (tasty, the breading stayed on while eating)",

But both times I visited, I was able to get a seat at the bar with no wait (once for a party of two then again for a party of four).  The bartenders are very friendly and personable. I didn't need their beer expertise to decide what to drink, but I saw them helping some craft newbies decide on a brew.  The draft selection is solid and is probably the best thing they have to offer. Be warned that pints are pricey, though.  Food is, to put it mildly, seriously overpriced. Burgers can easily run over $20.00 without much effort. If they were truly $20.00 burgers, this would be acceptable. But I feel these burgers and sides (brought in frozen or prepackaged, no less) are worth perhaps half to two thirds what is being charged. You are definitely paying for the scene.  Speaking of scene... it is crowded with youngish, good looking people. Saw lots of beer being consumed, but also saw a good amount of other beverages. I don't think the craft beer list is the main attraction for most of the diners.  Some places have deserved reps for great burgers (Father's Office and Lucky Devil's in L.A., for instance), but this place is getting by on its inexplicable \"hot\" status. Don't get me wrong, the food is good. But it's not buzz worthy.  I don't think I'll be going back here again unless it's to grab a pint on the way to eat somewhere else.",

I ordered the Peppercorn burger which arrived barely warm at best.  $16, really???? Milk shakes were OK but nothing special...all in all, $120 for 4 People, for lukewarm burgers with old garnish.

No fuss no muss... so got the all natural beef w/ a piece of foie on an onion bun. Everything was cooked perfectly, and very juicy.... definitely satisfied my craving.    The price was not bad too. $12 to add on the foie (foie prices vary from place to place but this was decent).  yam fries were MEH....wish i got the onion rings instead.  Ohhhh, and their strawberry mojito is great! soooo refreshing!!!",

    "text": "There's a reason I made this place my Vegas staple... it never fails.  We were in town for a week and I know the wait can get a bit crazy at Burger Bar. Normally, I have no problem waiting it out (the shopping close by is SO great), I mean, who would for quality food? But on this particular Tuesday, we had tickets to see a show at 7:00pm at Mandalay Bay and I wanted to score dinner here before the show.  I know they dont take reservations but figured I would call anyway and see if I could try to arrange something. The girl who answered the phone gave me the email address of the manager to see if she could accomodate.  The manager was so incredibly sweet and went above and beyond to make sure we had the best table with the best server and got in and out on time to see our show.  Needless to say, the service here is top notch, excellent.  Now on to the goods: the eats.  I had the Kobe Burger built my own way. The toppings you can choose from are SO original and they have a TON of choices. The meat was insanely tender and juicy, so lean, not an ounce of fat. I couldnt decide whether to pair it with the buttermilk fried zucchini sticks or buttermilk fried onion rings, so the waiter mixed and matched and brought me out a half order of both!!! And I'm so glad that he did... they were BOTH rediculous!! So, so delicious.  In closing, once again, the Burger Bar out-did themselves and keeps me looking forward to my next trip out west so I can score some more food there!  Would recommend them HIGHLY to anyone looking for a great burger joint.",

Our server was on point even though he was also tending to a table of about 16 and upon getting seated had our drink order put in.  The restaurant was quite skinny but went back quite a bit with the bar to your right going almost the entire depth of the restaurant. The atmosphere was great, kind of like a sport bar/club/family restaurant...if that makes any sense. We had a booth towards the back of the restaurant which had its own TV with a college game on. The music was loud and you almost have to whisper into someones ear to be heard, but that why the atmosphere was so great!  The food was drool-worthy! I had the Hubert Keller burger with bacon and it was awesome. It was a good sized burger with wine reduction shallots, sauteed spinach and blue cheese, it came with skinny fries (which were just ok) and was about $28. Our table also ordered onion rings, which were also just ok, and mozzarella sticks, which were pretty good.  Everyone pretty much licked their plates clean (even the one in our party who ordered the Vegas Vegan) so it must have been pretty good. Common, Hawaii, you need to get your burger game on!",

We did the only logical thing possible with such a short time in Vegas: to-go ordered our mini burger trio and sweet potato fries.  1) The mini black Angus burger was good and fairly moist still for such a tiny burger. Sometimes something that simple is so good.  2) The classic beef burger with bacon was my least favorite as it was the driest out of all the mini burgers.  3) Top sirloin burger with carmelized onions: YUM. The best one.  All the ingredients were fresh and the burgers all came on mini ciabatta bread, which was surprisingly easy to bite into. The sweet potato fries were good, but not the best I've ever had. A good handful of the fries were overdone. Next time I will be sure to make a reservation to really experience Hubert Keller's vision on gourmet burgers.  NOTE: He's opening a Burger Bar this coming late fall on the 6th floor of Macy's in Union Square!!! YAY!",

They have an excellent beer selection as well as a huge list of \"a la carte\" toppings for your burger.  For God's sake, do not order the Kobe burger. This is one of my pet peeves about most of the restaurants on the strip. The beauty of Kobe (and really, Wagyu, which it can't even touch) is in the perfectly marbled texture of the meat, which is completely ruined by grinding it up into burger. It's a stupid gimmick that apparently works very well as these burgers are so prolific on menus here. It's hard to find a restaurant without them here, so I guess I'm in no position to protest them all. Whatever.  I like the idea that I can get something as ridiculous as truffles or foie gras on my burger, but I never would. Choice of three different types of bacon PLUS prosciutto is very nice, as well as three different types of fries (skinny, fat, and sweet potato) covers all the bases.  It's still overpriced, but it's quite convenient and the food's not bad.",

Really nice since it doesn't alienate folks like myself who loathe mayo or mustard. My friend ordered the veggie burger which was big, but delicious. I ordered the chicken sandwich with spinach and pineapple. Excellent, and had a cider and fries to go along. Definitely get a booth which has a personal tv for you sports fans or sit by the bar.

    "text": "Pretty decent burgers. I'm not sure they met the hype, but they weren't horrible either.  To start, I ordered mine on an onion bun which turned out to be a good choice. The Kobe beef was nice and juicy, the grilled onions made it sweet, and the jalapeno bacon (yes, jalapeno bacon) was a really nice addition as it gave it a nice kick. And of course, peppered Jack cheese.  The regular fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini fries were all great... I just wish they had garlic aioli sauce.  ;)  The negatives I have are:  1. The price. Being $16 for the burger alone (as each topping has additional costs) gives it a reason not to go too often (thank goodness it's 250 miles from me), but I'd say it's worth it on the occasional visits to Vegas from here on out.  2. My brother's burger somehow turned out pretty bland. He had the Kobe with Jack as well but with guacamole and jalapenos on the side, so I question the consistency of the burgers somewhat.  3. To be completely honest, w/ all those toppings, it's hard to tell the difference between Kobe beef and your typical farm or Angus beef. Might not be a bad idea to save $5 and get that instead.",

As an added perk, there's flavored syrups that can be added to any soft drink (or hard drinks, I guess), which are delicious and add to any sugary high that compliments meat.  My girlfriend praises the Garden Burger, and after a bite, I saw the light; you can tell they are hand made, and like a good Garden Burger, aren't trying to taste like a hamburger; they're their own entity.  Give it a shot, you definitely won't regret it.",

    "text": "So I had kind of a mixed experience here. I had read the reviews and thought it would be a great choice for a casual dinner. My friends all agreed. The wait was about 40 minutes at 9pm on a Friday. (We used the time to grab a martini and buy bath bombs at Lush across the way. OMG heavenly, both of them.)  Anyhow. Our waitress was super sweet and very helpful. I ordered the Angus burger on an onion bun, with caramelized onions and blue cheese. She told me that was the best combo EVER and not to add anything, it was perfect. I like positive reinforcement, awesome. My friends all ordered and we spent a few minutes watching the Laker game on the TV in our booth.   The good: My food was delicious! The blue cheese was a nice kick complimented by the perfect onions. I had also ordered sweet potato fries, and they were great. Our server had brought out ranch and mayo for dipping without us asking, which we loved.  The bad: I ordered my burger medium and it was RARE. Bloody all the way through. Normally I would have sent it back....but I was starving and it tasted good. So maybe that's not so bad then.  The ugly: As I was 3/4 done with my burger, my friend who had gotten the sliders noticed a hair wrapped around the toothpick and bun on one of her sliders. This hair was so wrapped around and clearly not hers. Yuck. She pointed it out to the server and in seconds, a manager was at our table, offering to make a new plate or take it off the bill. She opted to just take it off the bill.  So theres my dilemma. I loved my food, I wish I could go back today, BUT I won't because hair is not delicious. Bummer! I'm still giving 4 stars though, it could have been a fluke!",

The toppings are excellent twists on your favorites (the jalapeno bacon, for example, kept my table's mouth watering for 48 hours after we left).  You'll pay a hefty fee for it, though.  I think we averaged just under $20 for a burger, fries, and coke.  That's a lot, even by pricey-city standards.  I'm glad I went, though.  If you don't eat a lot of red meat, you might want to warm-up your stomach prior to eating here.  Two members of our party were hit hard by the sudden introduction of massive quantities of delicious ground beef.  Pro tip:  Call ahead to get yourself placed on the waiting list.  We called about 45 minutes before we showed up, and we were seated within 3 minutes of showing up on a crowded Friday night.",

There are times you're not sure what you want, but other times you know exactly what you want to eat and that is the only food that you want. That's how I felt when I walked into Burger Bar. I've been to quite a few burger places, but this place is THE BEST. It's definitely one of the more pricey ones too. They've got a pretty extensive beer selection, shakes with and without alcohol, and of course burgers. Easily the highest quality burger place I've visited. I always try and avoid building my own burger because I like a lot of different things on my burger and not all those thing mesh. I'd build my burger here, because I can just come back and try a different combo. I got the Hubert Keller burger. So tasty. And the sides..Oh the sides. They have more than just the typical fries or onion rings. Zucchini fries, cheese curds, fried jalapenos and fried pickles. You could make a meal from the sides alone. If you know you want a high quality, best in your life burger, Burger Bar will not disappoint.",

I also chose a side of sweet potato fries, which was also great.   What was also impressive was their beer menu. I could have sworn they had every beer/lager in the world. If you're looking for something a bit stronger than a beer, I suggest the Chimay, white ribbon.  If you still have room after your burger, try the dessert burger!! It's a warm doughnut sandwich with ice cream and some fruit I think, but it was YUM!! I thought that it was going to be too sweet, but it was just right.

A bit pricey for a burger- about $12 bucks, but the burger came out juicy and flavorful. They have all these fancy add ons like lobster, shrimp, etc. But be prepared to pay upwards of $25 if you choose these options!

Well, at the butt end of an extended weekend in vegas, we had one last opportunity to binge.  maybe not our final meal on earth, but pure hedonism of vegas doesn't exist in San Francisco.  Perhaps a bit uncouth or maybe simply boring, we decided to go back to the Burger Bar for our final meal.  that's right... same place in 2 days.  But I ordered two different entrees so that means \"danger\" is my middle name.  First night, sliders!  And to make sure you don't fudge a good thing, you're not aloud to make any changes to the order.  And for good reason, the sliders deliver.  Three of them in total, one basic cheeseburger, a grilled onion delicacy, and a more exotic cheeseburger concoction.  Hit me!  For the picky (i mean discerning), you can also customized your own burger.  Starting with the patty options... 1) basic 2) niman or 3) the American Kobe beef.  Screw you Carl's Jr and your $6 restaurant burger... this one begins at $16.  Then you can add-in anything ranging from rabbit food (lettuce) to canadian bacon.  Of course, you can also get sides of regular fries, steak fries, sweet potato fries (yum), onion rings, or anything else... just tell them to deep fry it.  You made it this far... so now a word of advice.  Call ahead to make a reservation otherwise you'll be staring at a 30 minute wait regardless of what time you think most people eat their meals.",

    "text": "I was walking around with a friend of mine after buying drinks at another place. We weren't really craving anything in particular, but this place was packed and it looked like a good idea to check it out. I like the idea of the place, you can basically customize your burger as you like it all the way down to the type of fries/sides that you want.   If you want to avoid the wait, you can opt to sit at the bar (which is what we did). There was a flirtatious bartender serving us. She was totally flirting with two hefty guys in their 40s. They SO wanted her, it was hilarious watching them drool over her. She wore a tight tank top that showed off her tattoo on the small of her back, total bait for the guys.   Service for the food is pretty quick as are the drinks. The bartenders are pretty knowledgeable with the drinks too so they can answer your questions if you have any. You can also get a sample if you would like, which is nice. And if you want to flirt, there are plenty of bartenders to flirt with. TVs are also behind the bar, offering various sporting events.   So overall, it's a pretty chill place to go to. Fairly cheap food and burgers the way you want it. Worth trying out and fun can be had by all!",

I always get either to Kobe or the Buffalo burger, I recommend the Buffalo above everything else on the menu!    Sweet potato fries are good & all of the shakes are really good.  For dessert you have to try the Cheescake Burger but if they're serving the Chocolate Burger & you need some chocolate, you'll overdose on this one, the chocolate gnache portion is fantastic.  The more you add the pricer to your burger the pricer it gets but there are so many toppings to choose from that I change it up every time I go.  Tip for takeout, you can only order takeout when you're at the restaurant, not over the phone.  Yet the 20 minute wait for the food rather than the 60 minute wait for a table on a Sat night is perfect.  Plus there's a ton of shops in Mandalay Place so it helps the wait go a little faster.",

If I was in Vegas and was in the mood for luxury burgers, I'd go here.  Atmosphere was pretty casual, almost sports bar like.

The great thing about the place is the ability to build your burger the way you like it with pretty unique toppings.  Their signature item is the Rossini burger, which has Kobe beef (American Kobe I believe), with foie gras, shaved truffles and a madeira sauce and a small side of fries.  Price?  $60.  Since you can go anywhere for a burger, we ordered the Rossini.  The patty was cooked to order  and extremely tender.  However, the foie gras was overcooked and not all that good.  It tasted like ordinary cooked liver as opposed to the buttery and savory texture if cooked properly.  What a crying shame...  Overall, still a good burger, but pretty unforgiveable how they prepared the foie gras.  Don't think we'll be going back there, given the prices.",

    "text": "Ah the first destination of gluttony was at The Burger Bar @ Mandalay Bay. Not only was the gf and I hungry after making our way down to Vegas, we were starting to get grumpy about it.   The wait time: 25 minutes.   The gf really didnt want to wait, but lucky enough she decided to do so or I would have missed out on what could have been...a great experience.   During the wait, I stayed thirsty and ordered a Deadlift IPA. Being a gym junkie, I got the badge on my IPhone to prove it, I went with the Deadlift IPA just because a deadlift was a exercise. lol.   The 9 oz's of golden brown liquid was filled in a wine shaped glass. Why couldnt restaurants serve IPA's in a schooner. 33oz of great beer would eliminate the hassle of reordering. Id be down for that. Not your standard beer, on a empty stomach, you can get tipsy quickly. As I grabbed my beer, the bartender forgets to even ring me up as I stood there waiting for the bill. Our table was ready and I was not about to stand there waiting for a bill so I took it with me to the table. Already, this place was a ++++ for me. Did I just get this right? A free beer? Hell yea!   We sat down and looked over the menu. Kobe burger was the only option for me but I was debating if foi gras for a extra $30 even worth it. The gf rejected the notion of me eating a $60 burger so I parted ways and decided to go with some toppings.   Kobe burger........and then some. -Avocados -Coleslaw - American cheese - Bacon - Grilled Onions  The total for my burger alone was $26. All that was missing was a fried egg, in which the restaurant wanted to serve scrambled due to the recent egg scares. I ended up passing on it, but I knew a fried egg would have made it even better.   Oh and it doesnt end there. I got an order of sweet potato fries and a Caramel Latte Milkshake.   If your going to do it, DO IT BIG! That is just what I did.   The gf had a Angus burger w/ aioli and skinny fries.   As expected, when our burgers came out, Kobe beef is Kobe beef. I tried both the Angus and Kobe and was able to make a direct comparison. Hell, even in a blind taste test, I would be able to differentiate Kobe beef with Angus Beef. The very first bite of the Kobe burger and the juices gushes all over my hands. The texture was so soft and moist. Each bite took very little effort as the Kobe beef melted away in my mouth.   The Caramel Latte Milkshake was made of coffee ice-cream, caramel syrup, graham crackers, and butterscotch morsels. My god, it made me wonder what the other milkshakes tasted like because this one was just indescribable in words. Any explanation would be unjustified.   The Burger Bar got me. It got me good. Definitely a must try if you want a great burger.",

    "text": "My husband & I went here on a recent trip to Vegas, mainly because we watch Hubert Keller on TV and wanted to visit one of his restaurants. We enjoyed it--it's not fancy, more like a sports bar. I had the vegan burger, which was grilled veggies between two portabello mushrooms. It was great and I'm not a vegan! My husband had the low carb burger--lettuce instead of a bun. He liked it too. He also had a shake that I had a few sips of--yummy! It seems weird that we both didn't get regular burgers, but at this point in the trip, we just wanted to eat lighter. I would love to visit again and try the lamb burger!   My burger came with shoe string fries (good). My husband's didn't so he ordered \"fat\" fries on the side. There was plenty with mine though--so we could have shared. It just depends on how big of an eater you are.",

They're awesome!  Their burger selection is also out of this world. They've got everything from the plain jain Angus beef patty to Kobe beef with a lobster on top. Anything you get is worth every penny.  The dessert is awesome and quite unique as well. I got the chocolate version that's built out of a doughnut, chocolate thing, passion fruit jelly sheet, and sliced kiwis. It's made to look exactly like a burger, but tastes nothing like one at all. If you're ready for hitting the town wired, this sugary concauction will do the trick for sure!",

    "text": "Not good! Milkshake was awesome, burger was worst thing ever.  I had the Blackjack Burger on Ciabatta. It was somewhere in the $15 range. I know this is Vegas but I figure a $15 burger would be comparable to Red Robin. Maybe it was just the particular burger I ordered.  This burger was dry, the ciabatta roll was beyond dry. The burger disseminated itself, I had way too much roll and not enough meat. The meat (ordered medium well) looked suspiciously like my partners' medium rare. It was too pink for me. The meat itself wasn't seasoned (which is fine, I guess if you like that) and seasoning wasn't available outside of ketchup and mustard.   The fat fries were good, but they probably came from a bag so I won't spend any time on that. The milkshake was great. But was it good enough that I would go there just for that? No. Would I try any of their other food again? No. Was I WOWED by customer service? No.   When our check arrived, our waitress asked how the food was. We said bad. She didn't believe us(!!!) and then asked why we didn't say something sooner. Okay, it was our fault. It wasn't your problem to fix. It wasn't our assumption that the food you brought us was your best. What would you have done to fix it? So we payed full price for a meal we ate about half of. Do not waste your time, energy or money on this wasteland. You're in Vegas, there's too much good food to be wasting time in pits like this.",

We could have shared one order of fries but I wanted Sweet Potato and my DH did not.  He had the create your own burger with a lamb burger, blue cheese and jalapenos.  He loved his burger.

    "text": "I'd like to start and say this place deserves more a 4.5 stars then a 4.  So, this was my third time here, me and my best friend go every other year to Vegas, and we always make sure to stop here no matter how far away it is from where we are staying.  First trip, I ordered the Hubert Keller Burger, which is buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, and bleu cheese on a ciabatta bun, and my friend ordered the same.  Let me tell you, this was absolutely amazing, and i'm not that big of a bleu cheese fan unless its on wings.  This burger was delectable.  Cooked perfectly, and the addition of the baby spinach was nice along with the onions, and on the ciabatta bun, which feel apart 3/4 of the way because it was so juicy.  The burger is easily a 5.  The reason I cant give this place a full 5, is unfortunately because of the fries, which were skinny fries.  Now yes they offer different fries, but ours came with the skinny fries.  These were just a 3, needed a bit more salt and 15 seconds more in the fryer.    Drinks, this was the interesting part.  Last time, I ordered multiple beers, they have, in my opinion, a fantastic beer menu.  BUT, I ordered the Mint Choc. Chip Alcoholic Milkshake, which was absolutely amazing.  We also ordered the ice cream beer flight.  Put it this way, every single person in the place looked at us regretting not ordering this for themselves.  I highly recommend.    Second trip here.  My friend ordered the Hubert Keller burger again, and I ordered the American Classic.  Again, both cooked perfectly, and consistant, same issue with the fries though.  And again we ordered the alcoholic drinks.    Overall.  Easily worth going to over any burger joint on the strip.    Trick, take the Tram from Excalibur to Mandalay Bay, saves the looooong walk.",

I though the buffalo meat was good, moist, and it tasted better than my mom said it was going to taste. My mom ate the Kobe burger with Brie , and carmelized onions. She liked it so much she didn't want to give my dad a bite :)  The sweet potato fries were really tastey. Oh, and the Nutella shake was gooooood.",

Let's start the long list:  - Macaroni & Cheese Croquets: Fried Macaroni & Cheese. Do you really need to ask why this is so amazing?  - Zuchini Fries: Yum. I'm always looking for something different than the standard fries. These always hit the spot - Fat AND Skinny Fries: I really like that they give you a choice, cause I feel like everyone has a preference! - Buffalo Burger: Flarvorful, Juicy, something DIFFERENT than the standard Angus - Lamb Burger: The spices they use really bring out the flavor of the lamb. It's the perfect amount of spicy. Again, something different that actually competes with the angus - Angus: Great quality of meat!! Flavorful, juicy, and always cooked just the way you order it. I perfer mine Medium, with a little pink, and it's always perfect!  I also like that you can build your burger with whatever sounds good that day. I love blue cheese and bacon, with the aioli. The caramelized onions, or simply how it come. OH, and the ciabatta bun is what I always put it on. Chewy, soft, and toasted. Always compliments the burgers to perfection.  AND the BEST THING TO ORDER HERE HANDS DOWN.... Drum roll please.... THE SALTED CARAMEL MILKSHAKE. Yes, save room, cause this is what I always want to come here for! OMG, split it with your table, or keep it to yourself, either way this is my favorite thing ever. I'm drooling just thinking about it. Creamy milkshake, salty goodness to balance it out, the sweetness from the caramel. 'nuff said.",

Anyhow, lucky for me, after arriving in Las Vegas at an hour too obscenely late for there surely to be anything open but a fly-by-night diner on the side of the highway, there stood Burger Bar...in a swanky hotel, without bean pole, Texas haired ladies in stilettos strutting outside its doors. (I would only later learn that fine eateries are ALWAYS open in Vegas.)  Starting with the trio of fries, I found myself dunking perfectly crisp, perfectly plump salty slices of sweet potato, regular potato and zucchini into an assortment of sauces. Not since my days as a humble saloon girl had so many luxuriously creamy flavors of dips been set in front of me. The miraculous thing about the creamy, slightly spicy chipotle aioli, the sweet and savory white BBQ sauce (a Ranch + Masterpiece concoction any Kansan would recognize) and the sticky, smooth yet viscous honey mustard is that none of them were cancer inducing. Take that Skools!  The Kobe beef burger cooked medium rare offered a nice crisp sear on the outside, and when cut into glistened with a reddish pink indigenous knowledge to any mid-rare expert chef. Not only was this burger as smooth as a swig of the finest vermouth, but when topped with caramelized onions, chopped jalapenos and spicy ketchup, offers your mouth a loving amalgamation of meaty, sweet, savory, crispy and smooth. Ordinary burgers be damned...I'll no longer settle for anything less than Kobe Beef (I'm now broke).  Oh, and just to add a little bit more LDL to your already hyperactive blood stream, try a Nutella shake.",

The guys all think they're hot, and I constantly hear them all doing their Austin Powers' \"Twins, Baisal, twins\" impersonations. 2. The burgers are some of best on the strip. They have Kobe. They have buffalo. They have any kind of burger you can think of, and any way to top the burger you can think of. The appetizers are great too. I usually end up with an appetizer because I'm not a big burger fan... but other times the server will be very accommodating and make up a vegie sandwich for me. We have always had top notch service at Burger Bar, from the twins and all other servers we may get.  One of my favorite things about Burger Bar (aside from it being right across the way from Lush where I love to shop) is that you can get a beer paddle with 6 beers. They are good size beers, and the beer menu at Burger Bar is expansive. There are so many beers you can try that are craft brews, imports, etc.",

They don't take reservations and won't seat you until your whole party is there...so hurry up people!   The six of us squeeze into a booth where individual booth televisions make this a very sports bar friendly atmosphere.  If you noticed, I'm not the biggest burger fan, so I end up with the Vegas Vegan Burger with Buttermilk Zucchini Fries ($12) - Sandwiched between two portobello mushroom caps are grilled roma tomatoes, grilled zucchini slices, sauteed peppers, and a roasted eggplant slice.  Sure, it's pretty generous sandwich because they really do load it up with veggies, so you'll get your fill on the vegetarian burger.  The fried zucchini was pretty standard, crispy and not soggy at all.  The Husband had the American Kobe Beef Burger ($16.50), straight up.  They ask if you want to add various fillings like cheese, mushrooms, etc.  But he stuck to just the beef so he could taste the meat itself.  It was decent, but nothing special or worth the price.  (I guess what makes this place special is all the toppings you can add - 8 different kinds of cheese, lobster or shrimp, foie gras, chili, black truffles, or three different sauces.  All of these definitely bring the price of your burger up though!)  Service was okay - we had to ask the waitress more than once for extra Ranch dressing, etc.  It's a busy place and with high backed booths, it's hard to see your tables.  Overall, been there once and that's enough.  Don't think a return visit is necessary at this point.",

Bigger fan of chain The Counter in comparison.  The shakes were fun because you could customize and I got a pumpkin flavored one because it was autumn and I love pumpkin.  They were really good and you even had the option to make an adult version with alcohol.  We got some side of fried cheese which was pretty bad.  In fact despite being over priced we only ate a few and left the rest.  It's not that cheap, but it's vegas so most food isn't that cheap.  Overall it's okay, if your at MB it's great but don't go out of your way to come here.",

I'm a local and don't usually go to strip locations for the simple fact that everything is just more expensive. We didn't have to wait long, maybe about 10 minutes to get a seat and this was around the afternoon, right before dinner. We were seated at a table right at the entryway and it was kind of a bother, but we didn't want to wait for a booth. The burgers were pretty awesome, although I couldn't finish mine but lo and behold--my appetite came back when I saw that they had a yummy Nutella milkshake on the menu!! Way worth the trip!",

I thought a sports bar, with burgers who could go wrong? The burgers are not inexpensive; I believe our total bill was $80.00. (I should of made him pay..lol)  My favorite thing was that you could build your own burger, and pick your own beef. Of course I chose the Kobi beef, which was the best decision of my life. I could not stop moaning, and indulging myself in this delicious meal. I didn't even focus on my date, I was so focused on the food.. it was absolutely ridiculous.   Everyone must go here once, and indulge! Also ladies it's a great place to find men, this place is always busy!",

    "text": "3.5 stars. Let's start off with the positives: Service was very, very good. Our waitress was friendly, attentive, quick to refill water, and was basically perfect.  However, the 3 stars above indicate something wrong with the experience, and that something was the food itself.  I had the Kobe Beef Burger with Provolone and my fiancee ordered the Hubert Keller burger and fries. Fries were pretty good. Nice texture, nice flavor, but nothing amazing.  The Hubert Keller burger had a solid combination of flavors, with nice play between the cheese, the meat, and the sauce. If both burgers were as decent as the Hubert Keller burger, I would've probably leaned towards four stars. However, my Kobe beef burger, despite only being cooked to medium and still nice and pink inside, was really dry and flavorless. There was just not enough fat in my burger. No juiciness. And since the burger was very basic other than the cheese, there was nothing else to mask the forgettable patty. Perhaps I should have added some truffle and foie gras to liven it up, but then I'd just be enjoying those things, rather than the burger itself.  If you're going to come here, spend a bit more and get their specialty burgers, I guess. Wanted to like this place because Hubert Keller is the man, but left feeling a wee bit disappointed.",

It was cooked perfectly and all of the toppings were on the side, so I could add as much or as little as I wanted.  I choose the Ridgefield beef cooked medium topped with pepperjack chese, caramelized onions, guacamole, and jalapeno bacon.  Everything was so tasty and the bacon was perfectly crispy.  My husband and I split sweet potato fries and the fried pickles.  Next time I would skip the fried pickles just because they were so big and there were so many of them.  My husband also ordered the Twinkie Milkshake.  It was huge and tasty.    Service was fast and efficient during lunchtime.  While we were there we saw a bunch of UFC fighters eating burgers.

Dark panel wood bar casual restaurant for Hubert Keller's burger bistro. Booths, tables and plenty of bar seating with TVs lining the bar walls.  The wait staff was very friendly and attentive, but it seems like that is something common in all touristy eateries on The Strip.  A decent menu of standard milkshakes (chocolate, vanilla, coffee, etc), but you do have the option of building your own (alcoholic) milkshake.  The add-ons, however, were not embedded throughout the milkshake.  My oreo crumble was just sprinkled on top of my chocolate whipped cream and not throughout the ice cream portion of the shake, and I barely tasted the Kahlua I added into the mix.    Varied burger selection with a variety of burger meat options and toppings to add.  The menu also includes a selection of signature burgers.  The Hubert Keller burger was delicious with the complement of cheese and onions, and the au jus sauce made it absolutely perfect.  My bison burger was tender and flavorful with the onions and mushrooms, though I wish the meat itself was more flavorful (though stealing some of my husband's au jus made it perfect).  While parts of a given burger were good to excellent, the overall burger package was alright.  I expected more flavor and more unique topping combination for what I paid for.  You do have to give them props for the selection of burgers and shakes options, but the burger themselves are above average.  I actually preferred the burgers at BLT burger better.",

Got our order in and waited about 20 minutes for the food to come. No biggie.   Our food comes and I bite into my burger and the inside is rare. I send it back because the meat is so raw on the inside. They then cut my bite off and browned the area they just cut off. So it appeared cooked. I took another bite and it's still raw inside. At this point I am not sending my food back. I ate the bun and left meat there. $30 burger and I couldn't eat it because it was so raw. Will never eat here again.",

As an Alaskan I was skeptical but it was a big thick piece of fish that just happened to have been cut with a big round cookie cutter. Ordered medium, it was cooked nicely.  We added spinach, asparagus, and Gouda.  Couldn't taste the cheese but the veggies were great; the while thing was knife and fork food, not a sandwich.  The Vegas vegan was a little lame.  The pile of artfully arranged veggies was nice in theory but was lacking in the flavor department.  The jalapeno petals were our favorite of the several fries we tried.  Soft and tender with a nice kick.  Skinny fries were nothing special.  I burned my mouth in the zucchini fries more than once, even after waiting awhile for them to cool.  Relatives passed a lot of food on our direction.  We ate too many fried onions, but just couldn't stop.  Caesar salad wasn't worth more than a few bites.    But the pumpkin pie milkshake that my other half's brother ordered...that was amazing. Dude knows how to pick the right indulgences.   Liquid, frozen pumpkin pie.  Mmm, Mmm, thickness.  Which we'd started with a shake of our own: would have been a better choice than all the fries that sat heavy in our bellies long into the night.",

We walked in and and sat at the bar. The ambience here seemed trendy and cool it was a dimly lit and all the booths had TVs which was a nice added touch. Upon sitting at the bar we noticed the beer selection is huge with many options both on tap and in bottles. We decided to split a burger for lunch and decided on getting the Wagyu beef build you own burger. The build your own burger had so many options to choose anything from different sauces to different buns to cheeses, veggies, and meats you name it, it's likely an option. We finally settled on getting a Wagyu burger cooked rare with cheddar cheese caramelized onions on a pretzel bun with a red wine and shallot reduction. We also decided to get the garlic fries which were served with a garlic aioli. Our burger came out quick and they even split it in half and separated it for us which was awesome. The burger was cooked to perfection nice and juicy, and the fries were an amazing compliment for the burger. Needless to say that was hands down the best burger I have ever had. This place was everything I had hoped it would be and more. It was so good that we ordered the exact same thing the next day.",

And hold on a second, did I also drag out my family here because I read good reviews? Yes, yes and yes.  And probably never again.  It's a nice burger joint but the price did not match the taste.  I've had better experiences at restaurants less than a mile from my apartment and who's main dishes aren't even the burgers.  But this place has burger in it's name so I expected way more.    The description of their food sound so good when you read it on the menu but when it comes out, displays no appealing presentation whatsoever.  It's literally just the bun with meat in the middle.  They even make the fries sound awesome but they come out looking worse than Mcd's fries.  The only cool thing about this place are that the booths (if you're lucky enough to sit in them) come with their own t.v. And that's about it, folks. Gbye.",

The worst thing for me is to get a burger with cheap meat or gristle.  I did not have this problem at Burger Bar.    There are many options to choose from on the menu.  There are specialty burgers already designed or you can make your own.  You can choose your bread, kind of burger, toppings and condiments.  I chose an angus burger on ciabatta roll with sauteed mushrooms and caramelized onions.  It was delicious!  We also shared the fries and they were good too.  My daughter had a mint chocolate chip shake and that was yummy too.    The only downfall to the Burger Bar is that it is pricey.  I guess that what you can expect in Vegas now so it's no surprise.  The service was good but a little rushed.  All in all, I would definitely come back.  I'd love to try the Kobe burger next time; I just need to wrap my head around a $17 burger!",

To accompany the burger, there are a variety of sides, but opt for the skinny fries. And if you are up for it, wash it down with an adult milkshake.

FOOD: Turkey burger (4 stars): Customized with wheat bread, fried egg, avocado, American cheese, and mushrooms. All burgers come with the standard lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle. Turkey was cooked well and was moist.   Veggie patty (3.5 stars): A little dry but looked much better than any other turkey patty I've seen.   Skinny and Fat Fries (4 stars): I usually love skinny fries but I liked the fat ones more here. Nice and crunchy.    Nutella Shake (5 stars): Do not come here when you are trying to eat healthy because this was the best thing that I had here. SO FREAKING GOOD. Well anything with nutella is always good, but this was extra good!   Coke float(4 stars): Also really good (= They make good shakes.   Service (5 stars) Our waitress was awesome. They mixed up a couple of fries on our order but fixed it right away. She kept up with all our requests, and for a group of 10 we had no problems.   ATMOSPHERE (5 stars) Cool burger place. They have nice big booths to sit in also, with a small TV at the end. We had too big of a group to sit there though.   The hostess girls in the front were fake nice. Almost made me not want to eat here. Sorry I asked how long the wait was girls, but we had 3 kids in our group and kids go crazy without food. All you were doing was standing in the front anyway!",

If there was one thing I would change, it was with the way the burger was built. There was tomato on the bottom. As I continued on with the burger the bottom got a little slippery and after each bite I had to rearrange the burger a little bit. Got a little distracting. Also, being a busier place, it took a little longer with the service which wasn't awful as it was kinda expected, but nevertheless it still counts.

The burger was juicy and flavorful and the toppings were fresh. I loved that I could get it on a whole grain bun too. They have a few specialty burgers, and offer made to order burgers where you can choose from a very large variety of toppings (they even had 2 different types of bacon) and a bunch of different types of meat (buffalo, beef, turkey, chicken, veggie, etc). I do wish they had more specialty choices because I can be really indecisive with the made to order build your own selections. Also the build your own burgers got very expensive very quickly. I liked that they offer sweet potato and regular fries, we tried both and they were equally great! The do also offer a moderate selection of beers on tap and a full bar.  The only major negative to me with this restaurant was the location. It's in the middle of a mall, and is really dark and small. No outdoor seating was offered, and the tables were pretty close together. The staff was very friendly and helpful however, and overall I enjoyed this restaurant.",

I've had the American Classic many times with cheese and bacon for a nice juicy burger.  The hangover burger is great with the coleslaw topping and it definitely helps after a night of drinking as its name suggests.  Full service bar to eat when dining room is full is a plus and the friendly staff make sure the order is right every time.  The onion rings are super crispy and cooked to perfection every time.  Sometimes I'll do the fat fries that complements the burger of choice well.  Great place to watch current sports events while dining on a delicious burger.  The mini tvs located in the dining booths are a great idea and makes it feel like watching tv at home and having a meal.",

Never tried foie gras before, but the mixture of the foie, the cheese, and the perfectly cooked and seasoned beef was delicious. The fries were not bad, but nothing totally exceptional. However, the burger is enough to make one come back (should I head back to Vegas anytime soon).  The waitress was friendly, answered all of our questions prompty and in a relaxed manner (during a busy lunch hour), and couldn't have made the experience any better.   To continue this thought, I am not a huge beer drinker (prefer Whiskey), but both my buddies said the beers that the waitress recommended to go with their burgers fit perfectly.   I don't head out to Vegas often, but when I do, I would not be abject to stopping by here again (and getting the same foie burger as last time)",

    "text": "I was hungry, I was wanting to spend money on a great meal, and I was craving a hamburger. I wanted to pay a lot for a juicy tall loaded hamburger. I read the reviews; they sounded good. I thought a restaurant where the name of Hubert is on the label must be good. I looked at the pictures and they sure looked good. We got there, I ordered the Hubert hangover burger for $25 for my wife and I ordered the lamb burger with garlic aoli for myself The server did not ask any other questions nor make a comment. After a 45 minutes wait (almost missed a show) the burgers showed up. The Lamb burger was the SADDEST burger I have ever seen. It was limited to a bun with a relatively small piece of meat inside. It was pathetic. Nothing else with it. No fancy additions, no feta cheese, no \"Mediterranean stuff\". It was literally a bigger version of the $1 burger at McDonald.  When I acted disappointed the server started arguing with me that it was my fault for not having added stuff... I thought by going to Hubert's, the chef would be In charge of adding stuff. Also, they claim there was 8 ounces of meat...BS...there was barely 6. Th Hubert burger was another disappointment. Again, it did not look anything like a burger. It was a piece of meat with clumped spinach(or some other green tasteless thing) on top. It is a disgrace that Hubert name appears on this restaurant. Any other $10 burger would have been better. By the way, nothing is included. Fries are additional and itty bitty containers of dip sauce are extra. For  2 sad, naked burgers I ended up with a $56 bill. The manager heard of my disappointment. He came and he also started arguing with me. Did not even offer to refill my water or any other common courtesy that managers do with disappointed customers. The date of the event was 9-6-2014 at 2PM. I strongly recommend you do not eat at this restaurant if you enjoy good hamburgers.  However, if you want a big bill, bad service, and a sense of disappointment after a meal, then this is your place.   If you insist on not believing me then at least when you get there make sure that you add everything you want to your burger. You will be charged for each item including the sauces and be held responsible for the end result. What a disappointment. I am 48 Y/O. I have never tipped less than 16% to 20% in my entire life. This was the first time I leave no tip.",

The burgers here are topnotch and made with really good quality meat. You can have your burger cooked however you want it, and you have the options of making your own burger or choosing one of the house specialty burgers. I choose the Hubert Keller burger which is buffalo meat topped with blue cheese, baby spinach and caramelized onions, my friend had the Pepper jack burger which was Kobe beef topped with pepper jack cheese and tapenade. She had the zucchini fries as a side and I chose the sweet potato fries.   The burgers were both tasty. The meat was juicy and flavorful. Every bite of my burger was pure deliciousness. My friends zucchini fries were superb, and my sweet potato fries were crispy and just perfect. It was my first time trying buffalo and it was really good and not gamey at all, and I think I actually prefer it to beef burgers.   We also shared a milkshake which we customized. We chose chocolate ice cream, fresh banana, cookie dough and vanilla whipped cream. It was soo rich and good!   To top it all off, the service was attentive, friendly and fast. Our waitress was super nice and we felt well taken care of.",

Dining with a friend we ordered 2 burgers and 1 shake. It was late afternoon and a few customers, though the wait to eat was sufficient for fresh made to order food.   My pet peeve are restroom and although this one was clean, the faucet water sprays out and nearly drenched my shirt and the floor. I commented on this to the manager and his response was \"Yes, I am aware but the company has not authorized anyone to come out and fix it.\" Poor customer service in that respect.  I always think towards the comfortability and ease of things dining in a restaurant or using the restroom. My ultimate goal is to exit the establishment feeling good to come back and feel safe leaving. The restroom issue is a safety hazard because of the water on the floor, but all the same it would not preclude me from visiting again... for food. Thus the reason for the four star review.",

    "text": "When I think of Hubert Keller, I don't think of this place at all.  The environment here makes me think of a higher end biker bar. All the waitresses are wearing hip hugger jeans, tight black spaghetti straps with their midriffs showing, cleavage popping and their tramp stamps proud and loud. That said, the waitresses are all very sweet and accommodating.   I ordered the Hubert Keller burger which is a buffalo on ciabatta bread with spinach, caramelized onions, blue cheese, and the usual condiments. I liked it a lot, and it was very juicy as well. I loved the sweet potato fries which the waitress allowed me to substitute at no additional cost.   My other party member built their own burger: kobe beef with mushrooms, caramelized onions, avocado, and some other condiments that escape my memory. That was actually significantly better than the Hubert Keller burger I had, perhaps it was due to a preference in the meat selection.   The sizes are filling and I was glad I didn't order a shake, even though I really wanted to. I wouldn't have been able to finish both my burger and a shake without rolling off the escalator in a food coma induced state. If it wasn't so far off from the main Strip, I would come here more often. However, for those driving to and from Vegas, make this your first or last stop on your trip, unless you're staying @ Mandalay Bay. Vegas traffic just isn't worthwhile.",

I was pretty impressed by the service (especially b/c we had such a big group), however I was not that thrilled with the ambiance. While in Vegas there are few establishments with great views, the set up of the restaurant is a bit awkward and very narrow which makes it feel like there are many people crammed in.  The food however is just as good as it was in SF. Love the zucchini as well as the sweet potato fries and the burger was cooked to perfection.",

    "text": "We tried to check out Kilroy's - Food Network's Best Burger in Nevada, but found they don't offer burgers anymore (that doesn't speak well about Food Network selections, does it?).  So we tried this place instead, which is an arguable replacement, and it was convenient for us, with BB  being on the Strip and in Mandalay Bay.  So, I would say the buffalo burger I had (buffalo, baby spinach, carmelized onions, and bleu cheese on a ciabatta bun) was quite good, but really, is any burger $22.00 good for a 5/8 lb patty?  It's a popular place, but overall, I found it overpriced, and thus the 3 star rating.  We had a 45 minute wait at 9:30pm.  Wife had a Cobb salad.  Our vacation partner had three sliders for $13.50.  His wife had the Black Jack (monterey jack cheese) burger  at $13.55, and this looked to be the best valued burger anyway.  Good place to check out for the selections and novelty, but it's a one time visit sort of place.",

I have wanted to try Burger Bar for a long time now because I love Hubert Keller - I've eaten at Fleur de Lys so I also wanted to try this more \"casual\" eatery of his. It is quite different which probably is the most beneficial to my wallet.    The bf ordered the sliders which had Angus beef, country natural beef & buffalo along with fries.  I customized my burger - kept it pretty simple this time around but when I come back, I'm gonna load more stuff on!  This time, I got country natural beef, cheddar, peppered bacon, aioli on a wheat bun with skinny fries.  Next time I want to add carmelized onions & maybe a fried egg.  =)  The burger was really good...cooked perfectly, very good beefy flavor & juicy too.    Don't go too crazy with the toppings...just adding three items with the fries put me over $15 so even though it's tempting, you must restrain yourself.  =)  You can order a beer, cocktails, or get specialty milkshakes too.  You can even order a \"dessert\" burger made with a donut & filled with other dessert items.    Definitely would come here again if in the mood for a tasty burger. =)",

    "text": "We went there at the recommendation of a local friend who loved this place, but we left there just kind of feeling \"meh\" about the whole experience.  First, the good: There were a lot of options for our burgers, in terms of selection of ingredients, toppings, etc.  You can even build your own burger with just about as many things as you could want in or on it, truly making your own masterpiece of a burger.  There are a ton of side options, too, and you can even get a sampler of different types of fries, tater tots and even fried mac & cheese bites.  And the dulce de leche martini that I had was to die for.... It was the perfect blend of alcohol and sweetness to me!  Then there's the not so good: The place is ridiculously loud to where even with a 3/4 enclosed booth with high walls separating us from patrons at the next table over, we still could barely hear anything through all the music and noise.    I had the Hubert Keller burger, which as others have reviewed, is over $20.  Yes, I get that this is considered a somewhat \"high end\" gourmet restaurant, but for 20+ dollars, I expect that burger to sing in my mouth with flavor and texture, and what I got was a very generic burger that tasted overwhelmingly of the carmelized onions and slightly stale ciabatta bread.    The other burgers that our friends had were good, but again, no one reported that it was anything spectacular that made it worth the premium we were paying for what was essentially burgers and fries.    So in the end, it was a decent food experience, but unless our local friend insists on going, it probably won't be on our radar on our next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Brought the whole family here to check it out last week and we wanted a completely different experience compared to In and Out.  We wanted to pay the big bucks for a great tasting burger.  Not bad at all...  Ambiance - Well, when you put out a club type front person to take your reservation and then have everyone wait for a table, you kinda create your own \"must go\" type of atmosphere. Tables, booths and music, this is a long and narrow restaurant, but plenty of room.  Service - Not bad, not great. Made a few mistakes on the orders, but overall, decent.  Presentation - Food is kinda slopped onto a large plate, and if you order without fries on each plate , and choose to say, share fries with everyone, then the kitchen hasn't a clue how to make the plates look half empty with only the burger on it. I find that to be odd for a 20.00 burger. Yeah, put it on a huge plate and make it look like you paid a lot for a little.  Food - Good taste overall for sure.  Definitely interesting to either order pre-made combinations or order everything on your own.  However, the taste is okay, not mind blowing.  Price - Very expensive for the quality.  I would have to be careful when I come back, because I will not frequent this place. Getting to it is a challenge since you are going to go to a casino, park, walk and walk and walk...... For the money, without the club type atmosphere you can go to Grind Burger on Trop and it is as good or slightly better.  Overall - Good experience, glad I tried it. Would bring clients, but not sure if I would come back with the family.  Family note - Don't let your kids go to the bathroom alone. Seems that the toilets are in the restaurant, which make it safe, but the fact is the signs bring you to an exit door and you exit the rear of the restaurant and you are in the back of the public mall where anyone and everyone has access.  The door from this public area to the restaurant is open and so, BE CAREFUL.  This is a disaster waiting to happen!  Very poor security.",

My friend got the Hubert Keller burger, and honestly, for all of the bells and whistles it came with (carmelized onions, bleu cheese, red wine and shallot sauce), it was pretty bland.   I built my own burger with an egg and pancetta, and while the pancetta was perfect, my burger again, left a lot to be desired. It was just a flavorless hunk of meat, and with the thickness of the patty, it's an awful lot of blandness to process. Eating these burgers felt more like work than an enjoyable dining experience.  We ordered the appetizer sampler with plenty of fried goodies and a five-sauce sampler, and while the sauces were great (we kept them to flavor our burgers a bit more later), the appetizers themselves tasted like they were thawed out staples that you could pick up at any grocery store. In fact, I'm pretty sure I've purchased the fried macaroni and cheese triangles that we were served at Target.   We ordered alcoholic milkshakes as well, and again, were pretty disappointed by the flavor. Super thick, and while we both ordered different types (the french kiss and the chocolate cowboy), they both just tasted like chocolate.   With so many awesome dining options to choose from in Vegas, Burger Bar REALLY needs to step it up.",

I also had an additional side of onion rings.... amazing!   They have a HUGE beer selection, including many on tap. That's in addition to all the custom milkshakes you can conjure up!   Here is my overall take on this place. - It's Vegas! Most good food (especially in a report hotel) costs a few bucks more.  - It's a celebrity chef restaurant. Nuff Said. - The prices are *not* stupid outrageous! I mean... have you ever eaten in a \"Five Guys\" restaurant?? You spend plenty for those burgers... and the Burger Bar is FAR superior for a few bucks more. - The service was awesome.

We were told 10 min. wait for a table for 2. 50 minutes later, we're still standing there (why? not sure...) and watching 2 tables open, 3 tables open, 5 tables open... when we were eventually seated, we counted 10 open tables!! In what crazy place do you take a list and leave 10 TABLES OPEN?!  When we finally were seated, our waitress was sweet and the service was quick. Our food was okay. I thought the zucchini fries were a lovely addition, but there were far too many for me to consume.  All in all? There are better places where the wait is shorter.",

Service was brisk--our burgers were delicious, perfectly hot, dressed generously and the the drinks were topped off until we begged them to stop. Fries were crispy...seemed that they were hand cut. Price for two of us with sodas was under $50.",

Kobe beef, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, Madeira sauce, on onion bun - are you kidding me? I know to some people it may sound over the top - but it was EXCELLENT. One of the best burgers I have ever had. It is quite pricey, but I would pay that amount of money to taste those flavors again. Unforgettable, indescribable... too much goodness in one burger.  Thank you Chef Keller for creating this tangible dream. (July 2012)",

If you find yourself at the south end of the strip, do yourself a favor and visit Burger Bar for your burger fix.  Aside from the recommended options, Burger Bar offers guests the ability to customize their burger any way they see fit.  Bun choices, protein choices (even a salmon option), and toppings galore.  The fries and onion rings are pretty amazing as well.  I've been here a handful of times and have never been disappointed.  The prices are reasonable in normal places, and downright bargain-priced for the Strip.  I've dined here with a friend and we each got a burger, fries, and a beer for about $40 before tip.  This place often gets crowded, with wait times in the hour range.  If you want to be seated fast, sit at the bar.  The wait is usually zero and the bartenders are extremely friendly and helpful.",

I would definitely stay here for a bite and a drink if my teams were playing! The waitress and hostess were also very friendly and great service.   We chose the Herbert Keller burger ($21.95) and the sliders ($13.75). Both came with skinny fries, which were surprisingly delicious! Somehow it tasted light for fries, crunchy, perfectly seasoned and a great portion as a side for the burger. The sliders were also surprisingly good. All three slider burgers were cooked perfectly, ate moist and well seasoned. One was \"nature source\" with American cheese, angus beef with bacon, and Buffalo with carmelized onions. For sliders that sound regular, all 3 were cooked perfectly and all toppings went well together. In my experience 2 or 1 of 3 sliders are the only ones that are tasty and the rest you eat only because you are hungry. I enjoyed every one of my sliders! My husband had the Hubert Keller burger, which Buffalo, carmelized onions, steamed spinach, blue cheese, red wine and shallots on a ciabatta bun. This one was big but too soggy. Perhaps this is because we were taking our time taking pics but the ciabatta bun was so soggy that made it hard to eat the burger. Despite that, great flavours. With the intense blue cheese, spinach and perfectly medium Buffalo burger, wow well balanced! Plus it came with a full pickle which always is a plus for my palate.   All in all, a great burger place. I'd come back for the some or to try the Rossini ($60). Only 4 stars because of soggy bun and the price tag for the Hubert Keller burger. A fair price would be $18. Definitely recommend this one to others!",

My friend told me about this place and its Kobe beef burger, but I had no idea how good it would be.  Food: 1) Kobe Beef Burger - Kobe beef was really juicy, tender, and every ingredient was fresh. Definitely worth around $20. 2) Sweet potato Fries - it's a must with the burger.  Service: The staff were on top of getting people seated, served, and were efficient. However, there was a long line, so we had to wait about 45 minutes.  I suggest you go early to beat the rush, or you'll wait awhile.  After losing a good amount of money, Burger Bar cheered me up as I left Vegas on a Sunday.  I'm extremely picky about the places I'll return to and Burger Bar is definitely a place I try to visit everytime I'm in Vegas.",

I know it is possible, I have had great burgers before, but this fell quite short. Service was friendly and attentive, though they seemed to be in a hurry for us to leave, though the tables were half empty and it was midday. I opted for the Dry Aged Angus, which was a slightly more expensive option.  I chose cheese, caramelized onions and the red wine reduction with shallots.  I was surprised to find the burger to be quite under-seasoned.  The burger itself was good, but was missing that charred beef flavor your get from a great burger.  Though it wasn't dry, it wasn't juicy, either.  I would have expected a beef mix with enough fat to have flavor and keep it from being dry. The skinny fried were OK.",

When I was seated, I was pleasantly surprised that each booth had it's own TV, which allowed for me to watch the NBA playoffs up close. Definitely a huge plus for a sports fanatic such as myself.   I ordered a Kobe Burger with spinach, cheddar cheese, caramelized onions, and peppered bacon, while opting for the Fat Fries. I went with a vanilla shake to wash the food down.   First came the shake, which was possibly the best shake I have ever had in my life. This is probably an exaggeration, but it was very, very good. Next came my burger and fries. The fires were decent (hard to mess up fries), especially when dipped in the side sauces that I had added on. Unfortunately, the burger tasted how it looked; very average. I'm not sure what my expectations were, but a regular, messy, sad looking, lump of a burger, SMOTHERED in caramelized onions was not it (there were literally more onions than meat). Definitely a deal breaker for me.   I expected to get the MJ of burgers, and was handed a Darko Milicic: decent, average, not bad, and not worth the hype... Definitely not how I want to describe an $80 dining experience.   Three stars for the shake and the TV's in the booths. Food was worth maybe two.",

The one thing I don't like is that all the add-ons (For me: American Cheese, bacon, sprouts) costs extra :( .   I always get my burgers cooked medium-rare and that's the way they turn out. The patty is soft but I feel that it's just a tiny bit too greasy. That's OK, if you're eating a burger you shouldn't be worrying about grease. No burger is complete without french fries BUT DO ASK FOR THEIR AIOLI dipping sauce, it is phenomenal on the burger and even better with the fries.  The service has always been good here and I like the sports-bar style atmosphere. Overall one of the better restaurants on the strip and a very good burger.",

    "text": "Rolled in here around 8pm on a Friday night and ended up with a 40 minute wait time. They can text you when your table is ready which allows you to do some shopping/gambling if you want.  Fairly large place with two bar areas front and back, some booths along one wall and tables in the middle. Extensive menu featuring \"Build a burger\" options. They have some great milkshakes as well, both alcoholic and not.   I ordered the Angus Prime burger, on a sesame seed bun, with prosciutto and cheddar cheese. The burger was decent sized, maybe 1/3 lb. Flavor was just ok, didn't really seem like there was special seasonings or anything in the beef. I also got a Pink Monkey milkshake, which was strawberry banana flavored and that was pretty tasty. A side of sweet potato fries and it was plenty of food to fill my hungry belly.  Overall, the service was pretty good. Once seated it took about 5 minutes for a server to come over and take our drink order, even though it was busy. The burgers came out after about 20 minutes. You could definitely see the staff was hustling around.  I'll try it again just to see if I can find a combination that I really enjoy. Its not the best burger in town but it was good.",

The price is honestly average or a little cheaper than a typical place on the strip, but the food was great. The burger prices vary significantly depending on how fancy you get, and they have a build your own burger that's reasonably priced. There were three of us that ate there and we all got different burgers and sides and we were thoroughly impressed. Even better, they have a large selection of beers from Coors Light up to fancy craft beers from breweries even I hadn't heard of. The service was excellent and the food quality was spot on. If I am ever in Vegas again I will be going here for a second go at their burgers!",

The burgers here, even the basic American, are freaking amazing!  They're full of flavor and the toppings don't take away from it like other places. Burger Bar allows the actual burger to speak for itself.   Portion sizes here are pretty decent. By Vegas standards, it's relatively affordable, but by local standards (wherever \"local\" is to you), it's expensive. Expect to pay $20+ for your meal.   Service here was a little slow, but not too bad.   I highly recommend adding and over-medium egg to your burger. Oh, and get the \"thick fries\" too.",

Definitely a good option if you're on this end if the strip (located in Mandalay Bay Shoppes, area connecting to Luxor).  Huge selection including a build your own. Downside to this place is the cost - hubby's burger alone added up to $25 pretty quickly with the bison plus cheese, bacon and some extra fillings. Ouch!  I had the turkey burger which was awesome! My pineapple addition was super skimpy but the jalepeno bacon add in was totally worth it. Sides are $4/each and we each loved our onion rings and zucchini fries.  Great service. Lots of TVs including an individual one at your booth to watch a game. A good burger but a bit too pricey for what it is.",

I love foie gras and truffles, so I thought it would be the perfect burger but it was surprisingly lacking in taste despite the toppings. First of all the burger patty itself DOES NOT come salted.  It came with a side of coarse sea salt and black peppercorns to sprinkle on your burger, along with a \"black perigord truffle sauce\" (which sounds cool but was nothing special). Even after adding all of the salt to my burger and using the sauce it came with, it still did nothing spectacular for my taste buds. Not to mention it took about 3 or 4 bites of just the plain bun and patty until I got to the actual foie gras and truffle part (which were both tiny pieces and low quality as I could barely taste them). The \"kobe style wagyu beef\" didn't taste any better than regular beef. The fries it came with were just mediocre fries.   TL;DR-- the Rossini burger is not worth the $65 price tag.",

Maybe because we are a married couple instead of a bunch of single dudes who will probably tip better if given the chance to ogle the goodies? Who knows. Food wins. It is really hard to get a rare burger that is not goopy with juice and can be eaten without crumbling into a blob of ground meat, but at BB they succeed every time.

Like I said I always get the turkey burger and it is a very good size, and juicy not dry like many others.  The downfalls are that you have to pay for each individual topping and the sides that you want with it.  You have your choice of fat steak fries, skinny fries, zucchini fries (my favorite) and some others.  I have a hard time choosing between the three so every time I go I usually rotate them.  I have never had a bad experience with the food nor the service.  The atmosphere is great (first of all its Vegas!). I love hockey so during the winter months they usually have a game on with their many TVs (located in every booth and some overhead at the bar), They have a full bar and some good beers on tap (blue moon always a fave).  I love it here and every time I go to Vega$ which has been happening a lot I have to go at least once if not more.  They are opened late (I believe 2am on the weekends) so when you are fed up at losing at the casinos, or drunk from gambling too much at the tables,  come here and give it a try!",

It also took a little while to get seated (though not the 45 mins they quoted us, luckily!) For the cost, the chicken sandwich was just OK. WAY too big (but really most things in Vegas are out-of-control huge anyway). The zucchini fries that were recommended to me weren't as good as I'd hoped. A bit too greasy and not zucchini-y enough, if that makes sense. I think they had too much breading. The sweet potato fries I tried off someone else's plate were great, though. I love sweet potato fries! Those at my table who got burgers seemed a lot more happy with what they got than I did... So definitely go for a burger if you go there. I was also intrigued by the build-your-own milkshake, but after the HUGE amount of food (and seeing the $7 price point) I wasn't in the mood for one. Maybe someday!",

    "text": "Some of the best burgers around.  This place is located in the Shops at Mandalay Place, between Luxor and Mandalay Bay.  A totally unique burger menu where you can top your burger with pretty much anything under the sun.  If you are in the mood for a lobster tail or foie gras on your burger, they have it.  For the meat, you can choose from beef (they offer regular, Black Angus, and Kobe), lamb, turkey and veggie burger.  I actually prefer the turkey burger over the rest.  It comes out perfectly seasoned and so tender.  The beef and lamb are always great too.  After you pick your meat, you pick your bun type, your cheese type and then all the rest of your toppings.  My favorite concoction is a turkey burger served on an onion bun with American cheese, peppered bacon, and button mushrooms.  All the usual toppings such as lettuce, tomato, and onion come standard with all the burgers.  They make great fries here which come in both the skinny or thick varieties.  For something different, try their delicious zucchini fries.  They also have a big beer and drink selection here.  If you are lucky enough to sit at a booth, they are equipped with flat panel televisions.  The service has always been great here.  I have never been here when there was not a wait, but the wait is usually only 10 or 15 minutes and there are plenty of nearby shops to browse around while you wait.",

The beer was great and my girlfriend had a sombrero (khalua/milk) which was also very tasty. But now onto the nitty gritty. We tried the fries sampler with fat fries, skinny fries, and onion rings and all were cooked to perfection. I enjoyed every bite of them. Now....One of the BEST burgers I have ever had. Was the one they let me create through their nifty \"Create a burger\" section on their menu. You get to choose the type of meat, bun, toppings, cheese, anything you can think of to create your perfect burger. I got mine with a Wheat bun, Kobe Beef, Red wine sauce, pepper jack cheese, and jalapenos. The burger was soooo JUICY. Incredible. Delicious. Mouth watering! It is very hard to compare to any other burger I have had in recent memory. Although the Kobe beef makes it a little more pricey at $24 for the entire burger it was definitely worth the money. Enjoy your own burger creations!",

    "text": "This was my first lunch stop on my first trip to Vegas (last year).  In terms of atmosphere, Burger Bar is virtually indistinguishable from any other sports bar or mall restaurant. The schtick is the diner's ability to customize everything from meat to bun to toppings. I opted for the Kobe beef burger (which was $16), cooked rare and topped with swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and oyster mushrooms (these ranged from about sixty cents to two dollars). I also added a side of sweet potato fries (I believe they were just under $3). The burger was absolutely enormous, and it was more or less tartare-style with just a touch of char around the outside. The combination of toppings worked well together and added some dimension, but they didn't mask the flavor of the beef. The sweet potato fries were good and crunchy, but they weren't anything special and actually tasted like standard frozen ones. I also didn't eat much of the whole wheat bun I had chosen--next time, I'll just pass on the carbs. Service was mediocre (I waited almost 15 minutes for someone to acknowledge my presence at the bar), but the draft beer list was surprisingly varied (most domestic drafts hovered around $5).  Next time, I think I'll hail a cab and go to In-N-Out!",

The service was just soso, but then again im just being served a burger and fries so dont expect much. Was interesting that they offered a variety of burgers from Kobe Beef, Buffalo, all the way to a chicken and even Salmon Burger. I went for the American Classic ($13) as when it comes to a burger i want to keep it simple and enjoy the flavor of the meat. Ordered medium rare and it came out well cooked and tasted quite well 9/10 (the bacon helped that). The skinny fries are good but i will suggest you to order the Zucchini fries with a side of ranch cause they are slammin. All in all it was a good meal and i would probably go back if i was in the area and wanting a simple meal with no frills but a $13 hamburger is not something i want to buy to often as i can do that at home with minimal effort.",

I would save your money and get the regular burger and load up on add-ons, as opposed to splurging on the kobe burger.

    "text": "I LOVE Burger Bar. So much. As a local, I really try to avoid the Strip as much as possible. But this place has become a staple in my family. When we think burgers, we think Burger Bar...so it's well worth the drive down the Strip to get there.  Depending on when you go dictates how long the wait is. We've waited anywhere from 10 minutes to over an hour. They won't seat you unless everyone in your party is present (which I can appreciate, having worked in the restaurant industry), so if you're waiting for people to arrive, I recommend at least getting your name on the list. That way, when everyone DOES arrive, you can just let the hostess know your party is ready and your wait time will be shortened.  It's usually pretty loud in there. If you're looking for a quiet meal, this definitely isn't the place to go. It's got a bit of a sports bar feel to it, with sports games playing on both the big screens and the small TV screens inside the booths. But everybody always seems to be having a good time, and I can still manage to have a conversation with my table without having to shout at anybody.  They have the Chef's burgers menu, and also have build-your-own options for burgers and milkshakes (both alcoholic and not). They have non-beef options, such as chicken, turkey, or salmon. They even have a veggie burger and a specialty vegan burger, along with various salad options for all the non-meat eaters out there. All of the Chef's burgers come with skinny fries, but you can change those out for any of their other side options. (I usually opt for sweet potato fries.) If you do a build-your-own, you can add on those side options for $3-6.  I personally am OBSESSED with the Hubert Keller burger. I mean, I dream about this burger. I wake up craving it. And then I bug everyone I know to give me an excuse to go get one. It's a buffalo burger topped with sauteed baby spinach, caramelized onions, and blue cheese. Each component on that burger compliments every other component. It comes with a Red Wine Shallot reduction on the side, and it just puts the burger over the top. It took a couple visits for me to get my dad to try it (he was scared of buffalo meat for some reason), but I practically shoved a bite down his throat and now he's hooked. Buffalo meat is amazing!  A close second (in my opinion) would have to be the Peppercorn burger. If you're a fan of pepper and mustard, THIS is the burger for you.  Then of course, there are the milkshakes. Holy crap! So yummy! I've had both the Nutella and the Salted Caramel milkshakes. Both are sooo delicious. When ordering shakes \"for here\" they are decorated beautifully. Very artistic. But you can also order them to-go, and they'll put it in a plastic cup with a nice wide straw so you can take it with you.   I also recommend the Creamy Cheese Cake burger. This is a dessert alternative to the milkshake, filled with sweetened cream cheese and caramelized pineapple. The \"bun\" is made with fresh donuts! Mmm Mmm! They're a little small though, so...unless you just want a bite, I recommend skipping the \"Let's split a dessert\" part of the conversation and just keep it all to yourself.  We've never once had a bad experience here. Our servers have always been friendly, they are mindful of any modifications we make, and our burgers are always cooked to perfection. Service CAN be a little slow though. Depending on how busy they are, it may be hard to track down said server for drink refills or extra sauce. And once they take your order, you can expect to be sitting there twiddling your thumbs for 15-20 minutes with nothing on the table but beverages. (There is also a longer wait on the dessert burgers.) But! They DO cook everything to order, so it's completely understandable and well worth that wait.",

Service was great and booths are nice and roomy and four of us adults sat comfortably in there.  Burgers were great as were the sides and drinks. I ordered a custom made burger which does add up when you start piling on things like pineapple and different cheeses. Also added some foie gras to my burger which was delish.  The only gripe i have which i assume has nothing to do with the restaurant itself is that Yelp* has this as a $$ which i think it should be a $$$ considering there cheapest burger is in the $19 range. Other than that i have always had a great experience there and now that i live out of state Burger Bar is a must whenever i go to Las Vegas which is usually twice a year.",

    "text": "Being this is Vegas and all prices are inflated (burgers start around $14 and go up quickly), it is easy to be skeptical. However, I was widely impressed by the burgers.   The Spicy Lamb Burger was very good. It had a nice kick without being spicy just for the sake of being spicy. Definitely not a burger that will ruin your taste buds and throw you into a flop sweat. The Hubert Keller burger (made with Buffalo meat), was awesome. Carmelized onions and blue cheese, tough to go wrong there. My favorite, though, was the Peppercorn Burger. It had peppercorns (obviously) along with Dijon mustard and a peppercorn sauce. I usually skip the sauces or get them on the side as I fear they will be either overpowering or make the sandwich too messy. However this sauce was outstanding. I'm not a fan of creamy sauces and although the menu states it is a \"peppercorn cream sauce,\" it was not at all what I expected. It was not a mayo-based sauce so not super thick. Tough to describe, but it was fabulous. Here's a great tip, get the zucchini fries rather than regular fries. They are awesome.  I was very happy with the Burger Bar. Nice selection of beers as well.",

Also thought the fat fries and onion rings were good with the various dipping sauces (I recommend the chipotle aioli for a kick and the basil aioli for the flavor). Had the Chocolate Cowboy adult milk shake and it was the stuff dreams are made of. Asked for it to go since we were in a rush and it was presented really nice! We went at noon at were seated immediately, service was fast and reliable throughout. Would definitely go back for my burger fix.",

OK, full disclosure: I'm a vegetarian rating a burger place. Most people will think I don't know what I'm talking about. Fine, whatever. Since I don't eat meat, I have become very picky about my veggie burgers. Most places that serve them give you a frozen patty that was made in a factory somewhere and the waitress has no idea what it is. Blah... Burger Bar is NOT like that. They may emphasize the meat, but it was one of the best veggie burgers I've ever had. (Only one better is the black bean burger at Malibu Grill in Bloomington, Indiana).  My dining companions enjoyed their meaty burgers, and they said their sweet potato fries were very tasty. I was in the mood for more exotic fare, so I got the zucchini fries. WOW!!! Freaking awesome! Gimme more!  For dessert I had the nutella milkshake. Most people at the table were sharing and passing around desserts but not me. You will pry this shake from my cold dead fingers. It was perfection.",

    "text": "I've been to Burger Bar a few times now and I am a fan. I couldn't decide between 3 or 4 stars but decided on 3 because there are so many other better options in Vegas. If you are in Mandalay Bay Border Grill is the best restaurant but Burger Bar is not a bad option.   They have pretty much anything you can think of for your burger. Start out with beef, chicken, turkey, lamb, or many other types of meat. Add whatever cheese and toppings. Then you get to pick your bun from many options (pretzel, wheat, potato, etc). Once you have your burger you have the option for many different types of sides (fries, sweet potato fries, fried zucchini, etc). There are so many options you could get something different every time you come here, even though it is pretty much just burgers. I think they do have a few salads if there are people in your group that would prefer something other than a burger.   The burger itself was very good. Very juicy and cooked perfectly. Service is a little slow, but not awful. It was slightly overpriced, but comparable for everything in Vegas.   If I'm in the mood for a burger in Vegas I might return to Burger Bar",

Just as we were about to leave, we were able to grab someone's attention to receive menus. Once that was accomplished, service was friendly, glasses refilled, etc.  1 of the few places open past 10pm - after the Lion King show.  They have a great assortment of beers that anything you could imagine and have a craving for - they can produce it or something similar.  Had a Black Jack burger w/fries. The burger patty was thick and moist. Would've been possible to simply eat the burger patty alone (without the bun). For quicker service and avoiding custom orders, they bring the lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side and you pick and choose what to do.  TVs are on ESPN, ESPN2, and Prime Ticket. Music and such for others so it is a win-win for all.  $25 for burger, fries, and a beer is not what I envisioned at a burger joint but it'll do!",

    "text": "I am a burger-lover and Burger Bar's Kobe beef burgers are #1 IN THE WORLD on my personal list of top 4 (still searching for #5) burgers ahead of:  25 Degrees' (Hollywood, CA) ground sirloin burgers (my personal #2 rated burger in the world), Morton's Steakhouse's ground prime rib burger (#3), and Cattlemens (Northern California) Motherlode burger (#4); all of which can be purchased in the same price range ($15-$30 including side orders).  As a premium burger, the Burger Bar offers complete customization, cooked to order with all premium ingredients.  They offer premium meats, cheeses, toppings, and sauces which allow you to make EXACTLY WHAT YOU ARE LOOKING FOR.  In this regard, the Burger Bar is superior to Morton's prime burger and 25 Degrees' ground sirloin and garnishes.   The side orders (mac and cheese croquettes, fries, and onion rings) are cooked perfectly:  not too crisp, not soggy, not hard.  The ambiance at the Burger Bar, Las Vegas is a classy yet casual expression of the modern American diner/bar.  Located in one of Sin City's premier hotels and casinos, the Mandalay Bay, expect the Burger Bar to be constantly busy and loud.  Service is accurate and attentive without being intrusive or overbearing.  I have not tried other premium burgers in Vegas.  As such, in Las Vegas, where culinary experts are in constant competition, there may be a better burger than the Burger Bar's. But with over 1,400 Yelp reviews of burger restaurants in Las Vegas at the time of my review, the Burger Bar is hundreds of ratings past any possible competitors.  Cooked perfectly as ordered with almost every conceivable ingredient from which to choose, the Burger Bar's Kobe beef burger is the single best burger I have ever had.  My search continues for the next burger contender alongside Morton's and 25 Degrees.",

    "text": "When does a the burger ever justify the price? When we think about expensive burgers (or anything, for that matter) one of the first thoughts we have is a comparison to a cheaper alternative. If I eat a $20 burger, it is because I'm assuming its going to be levels better than the likes of other slightly cheaper, but expensive, burgerse like Shake Shack or Umami Burger and it definitely MUST be better than the best value burger of all: In N Out, am I right?  Let's start with the service. Reservation was set for 8, but we pushed it back to 9 with no problem. Loved that. More than half of us arrived and were seated quickly. Loved that too. Our waiter started out cool and informative. Then, the rest of us came and ordered drinks, but only the first half of us received them; the ones who didn't waited over 30 minutes before their drinks were delivered. Upon notifying the waiter, he apologized, went to the back, but returned soon after and sarcastically looked at my friend in the face and said \"30 minutes???\" *sarcasm*.   WTF. We're a party of 9 paying for $25 burgers that are about as good as In N Out with extra toppings in Las Vegas and you want to put your tip in jeopardy by being testy over your mistake??   Now lets move on to the food. It was good and I have no complaints, but it wasn't great. The cheapest burger on the menu was $17 while the most expensive burger was $65.   TL;DR - the food was good, but overpriced - something that would have been offset by the hole in our service.  P.S. He still got his tip.",

The place seems like a good place to check out a sports game.  There are numerous TV in the bar in addition to the personal TV in each booth.  The second thing I noticed was the price.  Be preferred to spend around 20 dollars for a burger.  The other shocker if your looking for a shake be prepared to spend 12 dollars for a shake.    For food I got sliders l, my advisory is if your hungry and not a kid.  Don't get the sliders they are small and not to much out of the ordinary.  I guess the highlight was the bun, which tasted better than most.  The toppings change from each burger , but not much variation in taste.  The shoe string fries were just alright not much else to say.  My wife had the classic burger which was about the same taste wise as my burger.    My main beef with burger bar is for the price what you get in return.  Granted I imagine there are better items on the menu, I'm not sure it's worth spending any more to have something that may not be really really good.  If your staying on Mandalay Bay property and really want a burger you may want to try this place.  If not try either Shake Shack or Burgur, both places I prefer over Burger Bar.",

My friends ordered the Reuben burger and the Greek burger. I ordered the baguette burger.   My friends stated their burgers were bland and too small. They did not think the price was worth it but they did like that the burgers come with fries. I agree that the burger was not worth the price. I ordered my burger medium rare and it was not. The spinach in my burger tasted like they were not properly washed. The brie cheese did not work well with the burger. I could only manage to eat half of it even though I was hungry. Keep in mind the burger is tiny, you can see my picture to what I am talking about. I would not recommend anyone coming to this place for burgers.   I figured people would come here for the big selection of beers.   I'm clearly not Vegan/Vegetarian but I assume that Vegans/Vegetarians would be upset to find out that their fries are being fried in the same oil as bacon.

    "text": "I'd reserved a lunchtime table in advance for our group of 18, and we were seated immediately when we arrived. One reason I chose Burger Bar, aside from its location, is that the full menu was available to us. Many restaurants in Mandalay Bay & Luxor offer a scaled-down menu for group reservations, which defeats the purpose of choosing a restaurant with a broad menu for our picky eaters.  I started with a Long Beach Tea, which was strong yet yummy. Then I ordered the Kobe beef burger, cooked medium rare, and added baby spinach & provolone. This burger was amazing! Its not often that I remember a menu description as being 100% accurate, but this burger really did melt in my mouth. I also chose steak fries, which were equally delicious. In fact, I ate some cold fries over the next couple of days and was surprised at how tasty they still were.  Our server on this day was simply outstanding. And the kitchen was on its toes as well. I was hoping to have an opportunity to stop by here again during my Vegas visit, so I could try one of their alcoholic milkshakes, but I unfortunately ran out of time. Nonetheless, I thoroughly enjoyed our lunch experience here at Burger Bar, and definitely plan to return.",

    "text": "Last night, it happened... I finally found the best milkshake I have EVER tasted!   Okay, let me start from the beginning.   We wanted a laid back, yet high quality experience for our anniversary dinner last night. After researching all of the restaurants at the Mandalay Bay(where we are staying), The Burger Bar really caught our eye. We called ahead 30 minutes to get our name on the list & when we arrived we were immediately seated. Ps. This was 8pm on a Sunday night.   The restaurant was clean, organized for such a small space, and a super fun atmosphere! My husband was excited to see a small TV in our booth playing the basketball game.   Our waitress, was super friendly & helpful! Nothing but positive things to say about any of the staff members we came in contact with.   We started out with the mozzarella sticks + marinara sauce. YUM! The sticks themselves were probably a 7/10, but the marinara sauce was TO DIE FOR! I was eating the leftover sauce out of the bowl with my fork LOL  Next we did the \"Build Your Burger Experience.\" So many meat, bun, toppings, and sauce choices! I had the grilled chicken sandwich on a sesame bun, with avocado, Brie, and caramelized onion. I tried every aspect by itself & as a whole. Amazing ingredients!! Nothing tasted frozen or like it had been sitting around. My husband had the angus beef burger with avocado, pepper jack, grilled onion, on a sesame bun. He wasn't blown away by his burger, but he also commented that he feels it's his on fault for not putting any sauce on it. I just feel like you shouldn't need sauce for a really good burger though, ya feel?   Finally, on to the best milkshake I've ever had..  We shared the \"Build Your Own\" milkshake! We did a coffee ice cream base, Nutella sauce, Oreo, and chocolate whip cream! The chocolate whip cream was homemade! It was so far from Hershey. Almost like it had a European taste. This milkshake was rich in flavor, but didn't taste like it had any extra sugary \"fillers .\" You could just tell that every ingredient was high quality.  I cannot wait to go back for this milkshake, but next time I'm getting my own ;-)  Overall, really great experience! I would absolutely recommend to friends/family & hopefully will be back soon!",

THE WAIT: None on a Saturday around 10pm for two of us. We got our own booth, with our own TV and all.   THE COST: $42 before tips for 2 beers, a side of fries, and a burger.   * Fat Fries ($3.95) - 3.5 stars I was craving potato wedges and these were good. A tad on the soft side, could have used slightly more crisp.   * Reuben Burger ($20.20) - 3.5 stars Juicy and full of flavor, great melty cheese and corned beef. Good way to kick off our weekend in Vegas.",

Lots of options for burgers here at fairly standard Vegas food prices, but I went immediately for the custom burger option due to the wide variety of options. The meat was tender and juicy while the buns and toppings were great. Size of the burger is pretty standard but they pack it with content (if you're a fatass like me) so it's nice and filling. Their hangover sauce is interesting too, so definitely the right pick if you want some good burger s after a night out on the strip.",

The Hubert Keller burger (buffalo meat, blue cheese, caramelized onions) was TO DIE FOR!  I would definitely recommend it.  The surf and turf was a little disappointing, which is why I'm only giving this review 4 stars, but that may be because the beef just didn't compare to the buffalo.  I don't think alcoholic milkshakes require additional explanation.  Our server was super friendly and helpful and it was a trip to see her twin working on the opposite side of the restaurant.  I will definitely stop by the next time I'm on the south end of the strip.",

Skinny fries and zucchini fries are great, don't miss an opportunity to order the sauces for dipping. Simply delicious!  It is a little pricey, but worth it. The boozy milkshakes are delicious and the beer list of imports and craft beers are fantastic.   Service has been unobtrusive both times, although the first time we went the waitress seamed a little overwhelmed, but the 2nd time we loved our server.

    "text": "My husband and I were searching for a place to have dinner while staying at the Mandalay Bay and we decided upon the Burger Bar.  Although the Yelp app stats this restaurant takes reservations it in fact DOES NOT.  When we arrived we were told that there would be a 15 minute wait.  It was actually more like a 5 minute wait. Upon entering there was loud music playing overhead and TVs in the booths.  We ended up sitting at a table which was nice because it was more intimate.  We checked out the menu and decided to build our own burger.  The choices they have to build your own burger are limited but they did have selections that I liked. I ordered the angus beef with provolone, avocado and portobello mushrooms on a ciabatta bun with a raspberry ice tea. We also ordered the Fry Sampler with mozzarella cheese sticks, onion rings and skinny fries.  When I asked our waitress Daylene (which is a pretty name by the way) if they had honey mustard, she gave me a heads up saying some customers DID LIKE and some customers DID NOT LIKE the honey mustard sauce.  Our sampler came out pretty quickly and the honey mustard was good.  When our burgers arrived I realized they did not come with fries on the plate. That was okay because we still had the fries from the sampler.  I have to say, my burger was tasty. Better than a Slaters burger. I actually was only able to eat half of my burger.  I'm not sure how kid friendly this restaurant is, but it sure is adult friendly. Would we go back, heck yah we would!!",

Which I find that amazing! And he also had a sense of humor! He was very attentive with us and with other tables as well! We did not have to ask him for refills or really anything because he was on top of everything!! Knowing how busy he was, he did not stop giving us an excellent service!!! Thank you Andres so much for everything you did tonight! I also work at a restaurant and I know how stressful it can be! As much as you try to please people sometimes you just can't.

    "text": "This was my first time to Burger Bar and only knew of this place from Yelp and ironically, friends from out of town. Most of my Yelp buds gave Burger Bar good ratings, so I knew a meat feast was inevitable.   Shawn H. put out a UYE for Burger Bar and I took advantage of this opportunity. Keep in mind that Burger Bar is located inside Mandalay Bay.  Most restaurants tend to cost a little more in a casino on the strip.  But at Burger Bar, prices are fairly cheap considering its location.  Burger Bar has a huge selection and you can also create your own burger.  These are all great call outs for a burger joint. But first things first, I need to point out is that this visit was during Lent in which red meat is currently being sidelined. Second, I don't drink much.  So, my review might not be a fair one at the moment because I am not reviewing Burger Bar for what they are known for, which is a burger and a bar.    This visit and rating is for their service and their Salmon Burger. The Salmon Burger is huge at a half pound and prepared medium well. Price is about $10 which is a good start. However, I felt that taste was lacking and the salmon patty was dry. I know salmon isn't flavorful in the first place, but I have had tasty salmon burgers at other restaurants (ie. Halphen Red in San Diego).  Since I was eating 8 oz of this stuff, I at least got about 40 grams of protein and Omega 3's.  In all, I was disappointed with my salmon burger.   The service is pretty good considering that our party was fairly big.  Burger Bar is very accommodating and the staff is excellent.  You can say that the service almost cancelled out the poor taste of the salmon burger.  I have not given up on Burger Bar. I still have their real burgers to try and based on what other Yelpers have stated already, this is what they are known for.   PS:  This was a Shawn H's UYE.  I had a great time with other Yelp friends.  Thanks again Shawn for putting this together.",

However, the truffle fries with the truffle mayo were absolutely amazing and were absolutely worth paying the extra money for. Some of the best I'd ever had.   The service was OK.

My favorite, if you have been to LA, is Father's Office in Culver City.    I had the Hubert Keller burger for about $25.  It was a solid burger.  My quip is that I do not think it was worth $25.  Maybe $15.  Considering that we can get an In-N-Out Double double for about $8, I would expect twice as good or three times as good and it did not live up to that metric.  The atmosphere is great and the waitresses are hot.  My buddy and I grabbed a seat at the counter quickly and easily.  It was easy to watch the bowl games.  If you are looking for a decent alternative to the other more pricey places on the strip, give this place a try.  Given that this is Vegas, nothing on the strip will be cheap, so if you are looking for more affordable options, plan to drive a bit off the strip.",

These women definitely deserve a raise or a promotion or something because the service they provided at this burger joint was even better than the service i've gotten in much fancier much more expensive fine dining restaurants. if you're ever at Burger Bar look for either Erin or Ashley (or bothe of them) and i will guarantee that your dining experience will be as good as the transcendentally excellent burgers.",

I had a angus burger cause I couldn't pony up the cash for buffalo or american kobe.  Buffalo burgers in SF cost less than HALF of that by the way. So I put pesto and carmelized onions with peppered bacon and extra pickles.  I also added the sweet potato fries which were nothing to write home about.  The buffalo fries were much better but still nothing special. Basically this is an overpriced version of the Counter.  EXCEPT they have dessert burgers. We tried the chocolate burger - a donut with no hole cut in half with a \"burger\" of chocolate ganache which looked like a turd, strawberries, and this slice of yellow \"cheese\" that was passionfruit jelly.  One bite was enough.   It was a fun experience but WAY too pricy for what it is.  And bad service too.",

The Chef is the auspicious Hubert Keller of Fluer des Lys Restaurant (SF/LV). At the Vegas restaurant they have an on-site butcher, all the ingredients are fresh, they even have a vegan burger for the non-meat eater. I usually go with 'the Traditional', BB also has a full bar, hence the name. The service is good, and the prices are indicative of a 4 or 5 star restaurant, but at the end of the day, it's worth the splurge. Burger Bar will be opening soon in Union Square for those that stay closer to home. Defn. worth the wait. . . .",

It's not convenient to get to but its worth the effort (and the extra walking will maybe burn 50 calories!)  The best part of ordering a burger here are your options.  EVERYTHING is a la carte: the burger, the buns, condiments, extras, fries.  You choose your favorite toppings to go with your favorite meat (kobe, turkey, veggie, Angus) and bun (sesame, ciabatta, etc).  You can order truffles, bacon, foie gras, and many different types of cheese to go on top.  The fries are an extra cost but we each ordered different fries to try them all out.    The tastes were very good on all facets of our meal.  My son had the choice of a burger (krabby patties) or grilled cheese; you'd think at a burger joint he would've ordered the burger but no.  The ambience here is great: servers are excellent, the lighting is cool without being too dark. The best part is the tv's at our booth which had the NFL game on from that night.    It's a little expensive but you get what you pay for in my opinion.  Looking at the other reviews here, 240 Yelpers can't be wrong!",

    "text": "2 stars: Meh. I've experienced better.  Nothing is as polarizing as the simple hamburger.  There's so many different arguments that can be made as to what makes the best burger.   Simple and cheap at some stand that's been around since the turn of the century? Gourmet and requiring a credit application to order at a celebrity chef's latest brainchild?  And every single combination and permutation in between.   Hubert Keller is kind of accomplished in the same way one would say Matisse was a good painter, or Larry Bird was a good shot with a basketball.   With that kind of resume, comes a certain amount of pressure to perform.   And that's my fundamental issue with Burger Bar.  It's been around for a while now, and it's definitely on its way down.  I've been here more than a few times, and after the novelty of the Rossini burger wore off, including texting pictures of the receipt to prove my street cred, and the novelty of making a few custom burgers - ooh, i can choose from different grades of meat, that are all pretty good, and don't really make a substantial difference once ground up and seasoned, to 99.97% of eaters,  this place strikes me as a big buck version of Fuddruckers that happens to have a celebrity chef endorsement.   Seriously. Think about it.   They both offer hamburgers with different grades of beef.  They both offer burgers with different types of meat. They both offer customized toppings. They both offer multiple types of fries. They both have milkshakes and floats. They both serve beer. They both cost more than in & out.   The last 2-3 times I went to Burger Bar, the service has been mediocre and delivered with absentee-level attention.   The food has been inconsistent as well, and what kind of irked me the most recent time was that I created a spicy burger, and when I told the waitress that there weren't enough jalapeno's, she brought me a thimble sized cup with more sliced peppers, and I found an extra charge for them on my bill.   Seriously?   You're charging $14 bucks for a burger and you want to put another $0.85 cents on my tab because I mentioned that the burger didn't have enough jalapenos on it when it came out of the kitchen?   Some nerve.   There are so many other burger spots and so many other celebrity chefs in Vegas with burger spots that this place is completely irrelevant at this point.   Unless you are here to try the Rossini on an expense account meal, don't bother.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places to eat in Vegas.  It's always a great place to take folks who don't get to Vegas very often and don't know where to venture out to eat outside of their hotel.    The Burger Bar has something for everybody.  They have a list of menu items they've put together as well as a create your own burger side.  Basically, you pick your bun, burger, cheese, vegetables, other toppings, and fries.  They have all kids of cheese, three or four types of bacon, many veggies, several types of onion, and even some uncommon items such as fois gras.  They have steak fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, seasoned fries, and zucchini fries.  You can pile it as high as you want.  The burgers are big and as delicious as you want to make them.    They even have a few dessert burgers where a doughnut serves as the bun.  Originally, they only had one and it wasn't anything great to me.  Since then, they have added a few more options that I have yet to try.  Their milkshakes are delish as well.  I usually make my own burger, but last time I ordered the sliders and they were very good.  It was a perfect choice when you're not hungry enough for a big burger.  The sliders are three mini burgers that are each different.  I'll definitely order that again.  Time and time again, this is a great place and always has something for everyone, carnivores and herbivores alike.  I'm not sure about the vegan folks though...  They do get super busy and I would highly recommend making a reservation.  Roll up your sleeves, head to the Burger Bar and see who can build a better burger!",

Straight up burgers, from a regular old fashioned burger to grourmet kobe burgers.   I sat at the bar at the bar while I ate, and it was a week day so the place wasn't too crowded, hence I don't know how to rate the service. But as far as burgers go, if you like burgers, you must go here. For the vegetarians, they have veggie burger on the menu, and for the adventurous, they even have a buffalo burger - and no not the buffalo that accompanies the sauce - I am talking a real buffalo burger.   They also have some real funky desserts to match their burger theme. Like a donut burger or a chocolate burger. I didn't try any desserts though.   Only thing to watch out for - it may be a place that sells burgers, but its no McDonalds. Don't expect a 99 cent menu. It is a touch pricey.",

They're not the biggest burgers, but that's fine with me because I didn't feel like a complete fat slob when I devoured the whole thing. I love that you can customize your burger, although the price will add up with all the toppings. The kobe beef burger was amazing! It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. Definitely one of the best burgers I've had. My wife's veggie burger was the best that she has ever had also. The size of the toppings are pretty big so if you're looking to save a little cash split the toppings with whoever you're with. The caramelized onions they gave me were plenty for two burgers. The skinny fries were nothing special but the onion rings were large, crispy and delicious. Next time I'll have to try the sweet potato fries. The black and white milkshake was tasty, with good sized chunks of cookie dough in it.",

    "text": "The good stuff.  Good basic burgers (skip the high end stuff), good beer list, and a good menu of ingredients and sides.  The bad stuff, most things overpriced, and the service.  Sorry Todd (the server), I know we were a big table (10), but that food took forever, one order was completely forgotten, and one burger was medium well instead of medium rare.  And while my wife got the $16 buffalo burger you raved about, I got the $9 Angus and mine was better.  The fatty cow is always tastier than the lean healthy buffalo in my experience, and at double the price for lean and healthy, I am not willing to give up flava.  Fooled me once and got me to buy your pricey burger while you had an automatic 18% tip for a big group, but it won't happen again, and hopefully all the Yelpers will be on to you now.  Oh yeah, Karen got the $12 foie gras option and it was nothing to write home about. Cool that it is on the menu, but I would like it to pay it's own way too.  While I don't mind spending $88 for burgers at lunch while in Vegas, it better be over the top spectacular at that price, and this simply wasn't.    Other notes: The zucchini fries were pretty good, though a bit mushier than I would have preferred.  And this would be a 3 star place if we had just gone in, got the Angus burgers at $9+options, had our food prepared right, and got our food in less than 50 minutes, which is kind of ridiculous for a burger.  Oh yeah, also cool that this place has about 4 different fresh bun options, 3 different bacons, and about 20 or so other interesting sides.  Jsut skip the foie gras and probably the lobster, though no one in our group tried the lobster so Ic an't speak first hand for it.",

Do not succumb to the temptation to switch in a fancier cheese- the melted American cheese, in all of its processed glory, is what makes the burger. Soft grilled onions, gooey cheese, perfectly cooked black angus beef (medium rare or less for the right texture)... it's a gooey beefy ambrosia. I'm having a flashback just writing this review.  Yes, it's great that you can make all sorts of wacky burger combos, but stick to the classic here people. It will transport you to new levels of beefy bliss, like Bear weekend in Provincetown or the first cook-out of the summer.  It's a bit of a hike from the casino in the Mandalay (it's tucked away back in the shopping area) but it's worth the walk.",

Another of our party lit up a cigarette and one of the bus boys came over and pretty rudely told her to put it out. I see where the guy was coming from but the attitude was unnecessary.  Shakes with alcohol were very appealing. Someone at my table got one and said it was delicious so that's something on my list next time I head to vegas.",

All were probably just below the level of The Counter (pretty common in southern California), which isn't saying much.   Service started off pretty good, and then suddenly turned ridiculously rude towards the end of our meal. I'm not quite sure what went wrong. We were all pretty friendly, and given that we were all slightly hungover, we weren't exactly loud or obnoxious. We didn't send our server running back for numerous things right after she came back, we didn't talk to her rudely, we didn't grab the wrong server and demand service, we ordered a good amount of beers and food for our group, we didn't order the cheapest thing on the menu and ask for waters all-around... in summary: we really didn't do anything that would piss off a server (and I've waited tables for years during college, so I know what those are)...   Luckily, we were too hungry, hungover, and close to finishing our meal to give much of a shit. We got the bill, left a sizeable tip to let her know we weren't going to stoop to her level of rudeness, and walked out. Given better (or at least more consistent) service, I'd say 3.5 stars, but a 1.5-2 for managing to almost ruin a fairly-OK meal...",

The server was slow to get around to take our order and just didn't seem like she wanted to be there or help us.  The zucchini fries were just okay. People were really all about them in reviews, but the breading wasn't much more than basic bar provolone stick breading. A few times the zucchini inside just slipped out leaving a sheath of uninteresting breading. Not awesome. The sweet potato fries were very good and the mac n cheese bites were good, but I seriously think it was just Kraft mac n cheese that was fried. That's not a complaint because I have a nostalgic fondness for that, and I have to say at least it was full of mac n cheese. Some fried mac n cheese I've had (like at state fairs) is mostly just breading.  For my burger, I was very undecided. I went with the natural source beef with brie, the red wine reduction sauce, mushrooms, and carmelized onions. It was appetizing and filling, but the bottom of my bun deteriorated. I went with the plain bun; maybe others are more substantial. I ended up eating the last half of my burger with a fork. Medium is more like medium rare. This doesn't bother me, but FYI in case you expect your burgers to be more cooked through.    The TV in our booth was not in our control, though the server did get the staff to change it. The TV was beat up with a good 20% section of poor/damaged pixels.  Our milkshake was the best part.  Not the worst meal I've had, but not good enough to make me come back.",

    "text": "This is a review only for their happy hour.    Between 2 of my girlfriends and I, we ordered all the appetizers on the HH menu and a drink each.  As for drinks, 2 of us had the Summertime Splash which had gin in it and 1 of us had the Strawberry Mojito.  Both drinks were very yummy and I don't even like gin usually.  We could hardly taste the alcohol, so we asked the bartender if there was a lot of alcohol and he said yes.  He actually added an extra shot of alcohol in our drink after we said that, but honestly, I enjoyed the original much better.  Needless to say, the bartender and the other servers were all very friendly.  For the HH menu, there was a truffled grilled cheese sandwich, burger sliders, pulled pork sliders and buffalo wings.  Every item was good.  The meat in the sliders was moist and flavorful.  My favorite was the buffalo wings.  It was not the traditional saucy buffalo wing that you might picture.  They were prepared with a dry rub, but was not at all tough or dry.  It was the best buffalo wings I've ever had.  I definitely recommend this place and would love to go back the next time I'm in Vegas again.",

    "text": "It's funny when someone hypes up a restaurant so much, that when you get there. You're not overly impressed. That might have been the situation here. I had the organic burger with mushrooms and swiss. Which is what I was feeling like at the moment. This burger was pretty juicy, I ordered it medium rare. Which, typically is how I like my burgers. Well done, and you're set to get a dry burger.   I figured, I just had a kobe beef burger and a buffalo burger a little while ago. It was just an all right burger, nothing to go crazy for, or go back for.  I was with 3 other people, and one had the buffalo sliders. Not one had agreed that they absolutely loved the place. I chose the sesame seed bun for my bread and zuch fries. Get the sweet potato fries, my sister had ordered them, and they were delicious. With a side of chipotle aioli. The perfect combination. The zucchini fries in itself were a little disappointing. Pretty much all breading, and no zucchini.   In the sea of overpriced restaurants, this place is probably the most reasonable, unless you want to stuff your face at a buffet. The best place to sit, is in the super comfy booths. They have a little lcd tv. We watched the riot in Vancouver after the Canuck's lost.",

Been there a few times and tried other items on their menu, but his Rossini burger is probably the main reason why I would want to come here to eat again.  As for appetizers, if you're indecisive like I am, then I would strongly encourage you to order their THE FRY sampler.  It's a decent amount for a party of 2-4 people, and it has a little bit of everything delicious there.  They also have a full-bar, so you can definitely pair your meals with a nice cocktail, beer or wine.  Good food, casual joint, and nice servers.  PLUS - if you're lucky, the one & only Hubert Keller may be there himself.  So don't be shy to shake his hand and chat with him.  He's a pretty down to earth guy.",

I doubt that was wagyu beef - it was super dry and flavorless. Nothing about this burger warrants $60.  The lamb burger was excellent. I ordered provolone (I think it was provolone) cheese for my lamb burger. Probably one of the BEST burgers I've ever had in my life!  The zucchini fries tasted like nothing and I think are frozen / bulk but can't be sure.   Service was not great. I will never go back.",

Boca & Morningstar, you may call yourself a veggie burger but you're really just some soy slime with a faux funky meat taste. Gross.   The Burger Bar veggie patty is the real deal - thick, fresh, and deliciously full of vegetables. I was a little worried by the description (pumpkin puree? weird), but was so delighted by my first bite. It bursts with flavor. I would have been happy to make a meal solely from a few patties, nothing else, that's how good & satisfying this burger was. Also, the beer battered jalapeno pickles were bomb! Crunchy & fried on the outside, yummy on the inside.   There were some disappointments - the bun wasn't really all that great. The homemade dijon mustard (one of the extra costs) didn't taste as good as grey poupon off the shelf. The cheese was broiled too long on both mine & my boyfriend's burgers, so it was thin and hard instead of being thick & cheesy. Overall, the meal was awesome and I hope I can go back to try some of the desserts & milkshakes (alcoholic milkshakes! does it really get better than that?).",

The Burger Bar at Mandalay Bay is Chef Hubert Keller's awesome restaurant and is supposed to be the original build your own burger.  I had the Kobe beef burger (cooked medium) with baby spinach, blue cheese, bacon, foie gras, and truffle sauce.  It was amazing (see pics).  The milkshakes (with alcohol) also looked incredible, but the burger and sweet potato fries were all I could handle.  The service was friendly and very helpful.  They have a full bar with delicious Bloody Marys, and a huge selection of beer.  There is nothing not to love about this restaurant...but bring your money.   Hamburgers at this restaurant can easily get into the $20-$40 range without much effort.  The price of the burger depends on the type of meat you choose and the toppings you add.  I'm embarrassed to say that my crazy burger cost slightly over $40, but I did go crazy when I ordered with absolutely no consideration for price.  I'd definitely go back and order the exact same thing or maybe try a different variation (aka get any type of meat burger topped with lobster).  Food-5 stars, Service-5 stars, Originality of bar drinks-5 stars, value-3 stars, burger joint ambiance-5 stars.",

    "text": "The 4 star average for this place is pretty accurate.  Ate here twice during my visit and the overall experience was great.  There's already a ton of reviews so I'll try to keep this short and to the point.  The good: - This place can cook a RARE burger. Thank you! - The buns are great.  Crusty and perfect for soaking up all those burger juices. - Great variety of toppings.  There's definately something to be said for getting a burger with exactly what you want on it. - Sweet potato fries were tasty.  Zuicchini fries were just ok, dipped them in ranch which reminded me of fried mushrooms and veggies at other run of the mill restos. (Side note: noticed in other reviews mention of runny ranch, this was not.)  The not so good: - Fleur de Lys sauces weren't that great.  Tried 2 and both lacked the flavor to stand up to the rest of the burger. - Music was loud.  I understand going for the \"bar\" feel, but honestly it was hard to hear our server (or anyone else further than 2 ft from you).  Other thoughts: - If you're looking for a plain burger, this may not be your place.  There's really nothing wrong with their burgers, but the thing that makes this place great is the extrordinary toppings. - If you've only had burgers at Chili's or Fudruckers type places, you may want to order your burger one doneness level up from your usual.  Those places notoriously overcook their burgers, so if you're used to their medium rare, it's really more like medium.",

Its one of the few places where a person can spend $60+ on a burger (which includes Kobe beef topped with a lobster tail and a portabello mushrooms). Vegas baby!  If Vegas is too far for you to have a customizable burger, I suggest The Counter over in the LA / Santa Monica area ifyou live in So Cal. Not as glam as the Burger Bar, but delicious nevertheless.",

But the burger... oh, the burger!  I plumped for the Kobe beef on a sesame bun with mozzarella, bacon and a fried egg, with sweet potato fries, and my word, I was in heaven.  The flavours melded together perfectly into one lovely meaty, cheesy, greasy mouthful of awesomeness.  The one disappointment is that we only found this place the night before heading home.  I guess I'll just have to make my next Vegas trip sooner rather than later.",

    "text": "Burger Bar is located between the walkway of Luxor and Mandalay Bay at Mandalay Place.  We went there around 830ish and were told to wait for half an hour.  We walked around, gambled a little bit and came back in about 20 minutes, they called a few names but no one showed up so we were able to get a seat pretty quick.  I am a burger fan and Burger Bar really hits the spot when you are craving for one.  The menu offers some already constructed burgers, but the fun part is the ability to \"build your own burger.\"  Whether it's fancy kobe beef burger with fois gras and truffles for about $60 or a black angus burger for $10, it is satisfying that the big burger you order will be cooked to perfection with the toppings you want.  I ordered a burger with jalapeno bacon, portabello mushrooms and pepper jack cheese on an onion bun, it was delicious.    The burger doesn't come with fries so we ordered onion rings, fat fries, and shoestring buffalo fries for an addtional cost.  They were alright, I would prefer some seasoning on my fries and they were a little dry.  I've had better.  Overall I liked the atmosphere and the convenience of the place since we stayed at Mandalay Bay.  I would definitely come back and build another burger.",

    "text": "Went here since I am a fan of Hubert Keller and had been hearing good feedback about Burger Bar. Came in expecting a good burger at $$$ prices. Boy was I pleasantly surprised!  I ordered the American Kobe Beef burger with sprouts, avocado, and beet root pickle. I wish I had known that the burger itself already comes with lettuce, tomato, onion and pickle as I read the menu as all accompaniments must be ordered separately but I was very happy I got all the extras that I did. I would definitely recommend getting the beet root pickle. I loved it since I am both a fan of pickled things and beets. It really helped cut through the richness of the burger. I didn't notice a huge difference in my Kobe burger since as a whole it still tastes like a burger, albeit a darn good one. My table mates ordered the Buffalo burger (which was a bit more noticeable difference and very good) and the Hubert Keller burger (which again was yummy). I also vouch for the sweet potato fries as they are crispy, ketchup delivering perfection.  For dessert the table split the Chocolate burger which came out beautifully presented. The chocolate \"patty\" was chocolate hazlenut between two donuts with strawberries, kiwis, mint and a passion fruit \"cheese\". It was a great ending and very unique.  All in all, yes Burger Bar is expensive for a burger but I do believe that we paid for quality and craftsmanship and the portions were more than enough for everyone.",

Tried the American Classic, Peppercorn, fries and the Caesar Salad.  The burgers were okay.  They did come at the desired temperature but its not like the pate was anything special.  The Peppercorn burger in fact has too find a grind on the pepper resulting almost a dusty tasting burger.  The bun these come in was quite good, but not good enough to make me succumb to eating it.  The fries were excellent, crunchy outside and light and fluffy inside.  The surprise was the salad, which was excellent.  This looked like hand torn leaves definitely a house made dressing with the perfect touch of creaminess with the gentlest hint of anchovy in the back, just delicious.  Very pricey, but hey if you are going to gamble on a burger, where else would you do it but Vegas!",

The only problem I had with this place is that they have little TVs at each booth, which makes it too easy to bet Oklahoma City in the under only to watch the Clippers put up 100+ points on the road and kill my bet. Other than that-- great.   Also, service-- from the friendly hostesses to the patient waiter-- was excellent. We spent $65 for three people (including tip) and had a great time and meal. Would have been better if Oklahoma City knew how to get some defensive rebounds, but so be it.",

Dark wood, open feel and a very modern take on a bar. The service was amazing. Beers were ordered quickly and shortly after so was our meal.   I decided to try the sliders with three different kinds of meat. Buffalo, American Kobe, and Angus. All were great and flavorful. It was great as I really didn't think I'd be able to tell the difference from one to another, but they had subtle flavors that allowed me to do so. I chose naked burgers because I really wanted to taste the meat.  The sweet potato fries were tasty and the regular ones were too. One of my friends got a Peanut Butter milkshake that was amazing. Wow!  It's Vegas, so remember things cost a bit more, but if you want a great burger, at a nice location with friendly service, this is the place.",

    "text": "It's a bit of a pain to find - first off, The Mandalay is set back from the strip, so you have to take a (free) tram to get there.  Once you do, walk through the casino hugging the right til you get to the shops (up the stairs).  Then walk most of the way through the shops towards the Luxor, and it'll be a small, unassuming restaurant front on your left.    It's a chill atmosphere, with whatever music playing the staff feels like listening to (my night it was 90s satellite radio), and personal TVs in the booths.  Nothing pretentious whatsoever.  Grabbed a solo seat at the bar, and was promptly greeted and set up/given water by multiple servers.  Patrick was super duper friendly and made my night very enjoyable.   He and another guy behind the bar seem to call everyone \"baby,\" which I found rather cute and enjoyable (although I'm taken), but I had the thought that a different woman dining solo as I was might have found it unnerving.    Whatever, I had a great time chatting and hanging out with Patrick throughout the night, and he was an attentive and informative server.  He seemed to really enjoy his job and is great at it.  Service can often make or break a meal, and it definitely made mine.  I ordered the Hubert Keller burger, with a few changes.  I got the Kobe instead of the Buffalo, and an onion bun instead of the Ciabatta.  I also ordered the zucchini fries, with a couple sides of sauce (truffle aioli and pesto).  The burger was very good.  Piled high with the toppings, and the shallot and red wine sauce was sooooo goood.  My only complaint was that the bottom bun was soggy as soon as I got my plate.  Not cool.  All in all not the best burger I've ever had, but a great one and it hit the spot.    The zucchini fries were AWESOME.  I've rarely had fried veggies that are juicy and taste fresh while maintaining a thick coat of batter.  Also, the serving portion is ample.  The sauces were great.  Sadly they don't make their own ice cream, which was more noticeable when I decided on a sundae instead of a milkshake.  I got coffee ice cream with nutella, caramel, and graham cracker (I was feeling a big pig-ish).  It came in a banana split style dish - very long and narrow - with two huge scoops of ice cream, shmears of nutella on either side and a couple of graham cracker pieces on either side as well.  The caramel was sadly missing, but it was brought over as soon as he realized.  It was difficult to eat - there was too much ice cream for the dish, the nutella wasn't incorporated and is hard to do so yourself when it gets cold, and the graham crackers were whole which meant I had to break them up myself and there was no space to put them really without them fall off the ice cream on to  the table.  So - bottom line - this place is good if you're in the mood for a very good burger, and some inventive fries/sauce choices.  For dessert, maybe stick with the milkshakes over a sundae.",

If you like milkshakes you're doing yourself a disservice if you don't go here.  A regular angus beef burger costs 9.50 while a Hubert Keller burger is 22. Carmelized onions and bleu cheese are that big of a mark up? They place it on a ciabatta bread that is extremely fluffy and not chewy so that's a plus. Next time I'll order the angus beef and put 3 cheeses on it and get some spf's next time. The quality of meat is fine. The buns are spectacular. Went back on another occasion and tried the Kobe beef burger. It didn't stand out like I thought it would. Still, you can't go wrong eating here.  Great service. All the girls have something attractive for everyone and come in different varieties while wearing a small top and yoga pants. You have the blonde athletic type, the very skinny and perky asian, the curvy alternative gal, the drop dead gorgeous latina with caramel skin and big, curly highlighted hair and a big, curvy butt in an extra tight shirt. I fell in love with this particular girl and tried not to look at her so much during my stay. This girl was bad ass. She is making some lucky guy out there really happy. Once you see a highlight like that at a restaurant I believe my taste buds take a back seat.   You should go. For the food of course. It can get busy so watch out for the hours and wait time. It can get noisy and they can sometimes play grating music.",

Interesting combination to put asparagus, lobster, and a [perfectly cooked but underseasoned] burger together on a nice soft bun but how you can charge $25 for a burger and not even include a condiment is beyond me.  You have bottles of ketchup, mustard, and A-1 in front of you - which one of these would go well with a surf & turf burger?  None.  This thing was dying for a nice aioli or something which would have made it less dry and a whole lot more tasty.  Alas, no luck - and from a French chef no less where you would expect aioli to be readily available for the fries and everything.  The restaurant is crazy busy but has 2 long bar seating areas as well as quite a few tables.  They do a great business and the vibe is good, I'll try to return at some point but it just annoys me when restaurants take good food and ruin it by forgetting about the little things like seasoning and in this case condiments.  Maybe the other burgers are better, presumably that's the case unless everyone is there just based on the hype.  In Vegas, it could be either one.",

I have been a vegetarian for 6 years now and have had many a veggie burger.  This was was very very mush.  Think the texture of a rice casserole on a bun.  I finally had to take it out the ciabatta bun to finish it because the texture was freaking me out.  It was very tasty though... loved the many ingredients and thought it was cool that the veggie burger was made with pumpkin puree.  I got blue cheese, button mushrooms and asparagus as toppings.  The asparagus was the PERFECT  burger topping.  The blue cheese was big chunks and the perfect amount.  I would skip the mushrooms next time.  Just nothing to write home about.  The skinny fries didn't look like much were DELICIOUS!!  The nutella milkshake was so unbelievably amazing.  You must splurge and have one!!  My husband had their signature buffallo burger and really enjoyed it.  It looked fabulous.  I was suprised by the ambiance.   I was expecting a counter service type place.  But this is a sit down, darker bar atmosphere.  I also hated how you had to walk down a long hallway and then out of the restaurant to get to the bathroom.  Go before you come.  ;)",

We had reservations for 35 people and when we checked in we told them that there would only be 25 people. They took one of the tables away. Naturally. We then ate mediocre burgers that you would expect to be much better at a place that calls themselves Burger Bar. Not impressive at all.   Time for the bill. They charged us $200 for the reservation then proceeded to make us pay for 35 people when we only had 25 that actually ate. Everyone talked to the managers and they had no empathy or understanding and really could less about why it is completely absurd to charge us for 10 people that didn't eat. The place wasn't crowded so it's not like they were turning people away so they could have waived that rule but clearly had no interest in having any decency. Out of all the places to go in Vegas, do not waste your time here",

My burger was cooked perfect, there \"some pink\" is more red then most but I like that, warning to those who don't.  There was a few fry options, fat and skinny fries and then zucchini. I went with zucchini and it was a refreshing change.  Drinks were expensive but I was expecting that.  Our waitress was great.  I would 100% return here.",

Let me just say that the burgers were really good.  I got the sampler so that I could try the different types of burgers offered. My husband loved his burger.  He did a build your own with the jalapeno bacon, pepper jack, and pineapple.  Let me repeat, he LOVED his burger.    I hate to give this place only 3 stars but the burgers were not enough to make up for the lack of service.  We has to ask for our drinks to be refilled although people were constantly walking by us at the bar.  We also had to ask for our check and when we finally got it, we were charged for things we didn't order OR receive.  The fixed the check for us, but it still took a while since we again had to get someone attention.   I really hope that the service gets better because I would love to go back there on our next Vegas trip!",

There's plenty of other stuff on the menu too besides just burgers. They got appetizers, salads, \"low carb healthy\" stuff, \"vegetarian options\". Also got some \"special\" meats you can order for your burger...like turkey, lamb or buffalo.   I ordered The Hangover Burger which is basically a regular hamburger with onions, tomatoes and lettuce. They give you a pickle spear on the side. (no cheese...I'm sure that costs extra if you want that option.) My burger automatically came with fat fries. Even though it was only a hamburger....this tasted really good. They had a \"hangover\" sauce in my burger and to me, it kinda sorta tasted like thousand island. I truly enjoyed my burger. Price was...eh...average. $13.95 including fries. Not bad when it comes to food prices on the strip.",

Sitting at the bar was a good alternative to  waiting  for a  table at lunch. They have some standard burger configurations (from $12 to $65), but they also have a make your own section. So I concocted an angus beef burger on sesame seed bun with caramelized onions,  peppers and American cheese. And a side order of a combo of fat fries and onion rings (ask nicely and they might combo it for you, too).   The burger was amazing. Cooked perfectly medium with a  pink center, and quite juicy. The burger and toppings were perfectly sized to each other and the bun, which is something you don't often see. And the toppings were plentiful. This is one of the best burgers I've had. The fries were nothing to write home about, but the onion rings were crispy rings of perfection.   The price is a bit steep ($18 for the above) but I think well worth it. After all, a quick burger at the Mandalay pool costs $12.   A new favorite place to go In Vegas.",

    "text": "The original celebrity chef burger joint in Vegas and still the best.   100+ visits, it's all about consistency.  High quality proteins, fresh baked buns, well sourced cheeses, well made toppings that could adorn any steakhouse menu, proper cooking to temp and bar friendly service.  Expensive, yes but quality justifies the price (dollars and calories).  Review by \"build your own\" mouthwatering examples:  1.  Lamb burger (onion bun, sauteed spinach, jalapeno bacon) - Blend of lamb and beef, heavily seasoned with a merguez spice blend.  Nice chew on the rich, moist burger.  Upfront spice flavor that finishes with the pleasant gaminess of lamb.  The thick layer of well drained sauteed spinach and spiciness of the jalapeno bacon make the burger sing.  2.  Turkey burger (onion bun, caramelized onions, grilled pineapple, jalapeno bacon, bleu cheese) - Whoa, it taste like turkey.  Well seasoned, very moist (press it with a fork and juices flow).  Extremely well caramelized onions with incredible sweetness that pairs well with the juicy pineapple.  Heat from the bacon and earthiness of the bleu cheese round out the flavor.  3.  Australian Wagyu (ciabatta bun, pan seared foie, black truffle) - Heaven.  The burger, very rich and juicy, not overly dense.  The livery notes of the foie add complexity albeit richness, the truffle earthy umami that heightens the natural sweetness of the beef.    With every burger, the usual burger toppings (lettuce, tomato, raw onion) always eaten as a salad with the ranch dressing provided with an order of buttermilk zucchini fries; another winner.  50+ beers on tap backed by a solid list of bottles.  Full bar if you're not feeling the burger and beer pairing.  Outstanding, friendly, efficient service especially at the bar.  Solid.",

It seems like a lot of people really dig this place and the service they've received in the past.  We came in here after going to Happy Place with some friends since we were a bit hungry after and hadn't had dinner yet. We were seated almost immediately which was awesome. I was super excited to try this place out since again, the reviews seemed like it was a hit. One of the coolest parts about our booth was that it had its own TV in it, which was amazing. There was a button and no one really explained how to change the channel, but I'm assuming that's how you do it. My husband didn't want me to change the channel because that was the game he wanted to watch hah!  And here's probably why my star rating was a bit lower. The service was super slow. It took about 15 minutes before a server finally came over. To be quite honest, it felt like we were being ignored for most of the experience, which was a real bummer. When we ordered, we ordered a side of ranch and didn't get it. Once we got our food and noticed we didn't get the ranch, it took a while for her to come back and check on us before we could mention that we never got our side of ranch.   The food was super delicious though. We all ordered sliders and really enjoyed all of them. I loved the way the food was plated, too! The fries came in a paper bag, which was pretty cute. I also got a shake to go, too. Which was super chocolatey (just the way I like it!).  To be honest, I'll probably give this place another chance and come back in another time when I'm in the area.",

Burger Bar Service & Ambiance:   The main entrance is small but this restaurant runs deep like a tunnel with plenty of tables, booths, a full bar  burger and contemporary classy upscale sports bar feel.  I love how some of the booths have their own monitors to watch sports.  Our server was super friendly and got along super well with my friend's daughter and were buddies by the time we left. The kitchen got our boujie burgers to us pretty quickly.  Burger Bar...Burgers& truffle fries:  I went with the Lamb burger.  It's 50/50 Australian Lamb/Angus beef but 100% delicious.  This was a unique burger that I thoroughly enjoyed.  My progressive friend from California went with the Beyond Meat Burger which is a plant based burger that identifies with being meat and she enjoyed hers as well.  FYI the burgers don't come with fries so we shared the truffle fries with the truffle mayo.  We dug the double truffle action on the fries..  Overall, the Burger Bar still offers a great boujie boutique burger experience.   The more creative or boujie the burgers start getting close to $20 quickly but you knew that coming in here.  Or at least you do now after reading this review.  =)  I'm sure my next visit won't be so long as there were some other interesting burgers that caught my eye.  Enjoy!",

At 8:30, we were told it would be a 10 minute wait, which was fine. We were seated a little before the 10 minute mark.   Our first waitress came over to take our drink order, which our second waitress delivered to us. She then told us she was taking over because our first waitress got busy and so she took our food order. We then waited and waited and waited for over 30 minutes. No waitress in sight, no food. Another waiter then came over and said our food was up next, but when he brought it over to us, it wasn't our food. It belonged to the table next to us. So we waited some more. Finally our food trickled out and it was honestly mediocre at best. 3 of our burgers were super dry, my husband loved his however.  The service was very slow, even with 3 waiters/waitresses serving us. The sad thing was, it wasn't even busy so not sure what happened.",

Real quick on the service: place was busy but not packed. Water spilled water on me twice and the bussers dropped two used utensils on my lap. The waitress was slow. I tried to order appetizers twice and she walked past me. So service was sub-par to say the least. Also, the waitress asked me how I wanted my burger. I told her medium and she gave me some long winded explanation on what medium is then asked me again if that's what. Might be my least favorite interaction with a waitstaff of all time.  I don't mind pricey gourmet burgers and there are so many of them on the strip. Even by those standard these are pricy. I went pretty basic and it was still over $60 for two people. I guess about the same as other high end burger spots, but I didn't feel like I got as much in quality or quantity.   The burger height was the saving grace. I got pepper jack cheese and chipotle aioli. Kept it simple wanted to mostly taste what I anticipated was a high quality of meat. To that end there wasn't anything special about the meat. Beyond that the chipotle aioli was bland. The onion bun was soft, but otherwise forgetful. So what makes this \"gourmet\" burger place special? Definitely not the soggy onion rings.   This place also has the most absurd reservation policy/fine system I've ever heard of. Didn't effect me but listening to the host explain it to someone I found myself thinking \"Never make reservations here unless you're willing to risk your soul on being able to make them.\" Not a ton of space for groups of more than 8 comfortably.   The burger alone with price is an averages gourmet burger. Factor in subpar service. Lackluster toppings and sides. And I'm left wondering what people see in this place.",

    "text": "After meeting Hubert Keller and finding out he had another restaurant in Mandalay Bay, we had to try it! It's a bar type atmosphere in the shops that connect Mandalay Bay to Luxor.   They have a big menu with tons of options! If you don't want one of their burgers on the menu, there's a huge list of toppings that you can build your own. They also have multiple options for the side such as fries, tator tots, etc. The food was good but honestly just another burger place. I would be interested in going back to try one of their specialty burgers because I ordered a basic bacon cheeseburger the first time. The fries were too big and not cooked well enough. (Soft inside)   For dessert, we ordered make your own s'mores...always a great idea! They provided many toppings, in addition to the normal chocolate and marshmallows.   We sat at a booth in the bar and each one had a TV.",

Their burgers are always great (though I often choose perhaps too many veggies to add to my meal), and the milkshakes really do hit the spot after a busy day on the strip.   I have never had trouble with my friends finding something to eat on their menu. And the service we get here is pretty good considering just how busy this location gets. Perhaps it was once the best Burger restaurant on the strip, but for me it is always just one of my favourite Vegas restaurants. It's a great place for burgers and I'll always seek it out given a trip to Vegas. Located between the Luxor and the Mandalay Bay Casino, it is pretty easy to find and well worth a visit.",

When can a hamburger be worth $65? When it's built with Kobe beef, foie gras and truffle shavings and dubbed the Rossini burger by Chef Hubert Keller. Most menu options are more down-to-earth. You can select gourmet burger toppings and pair them with skinny fries and a liquor-spiked milkshake or beer float.  You'll find plenty of gourmet touches to these quality hamburgers. Patties made from beef, buffalo, and turkey are topped off with things like tapenade, roasted pineapple, or fried egg. While the American Classic is everything a burger lover could want--Angus beef, cheese, bacon, tomato and onion.",

The food was great we had a couple of Kobe burgers which I asked for a little medium rare paint but it seemed a little dry to me but it was still good keep in mind you buy the burger and whatever you add to it is extra charge and also fries are sold separately so you probably end up walking out of their pay $55-$65 a couple. But the food is delicious excellent customer service",

Parking Paid self parking at Mandalay (free for Pearl M Life members) or valet.  Service Service was friendly but slow at times even though there was only a couple tables.  Food Reuben The Black Angus beef really stood out in this case it was very tender and juicy. The flavoring was off from a typical Reuben sandwich, the sauerkraut in particular was very weak. The corned beef was non-existent as well. Reubens has a very distinct flavor and this burger was severely lacking in that flavor. 1 star  Chocolate burger This was an interesting dessert. I found it a tad too sweet for my taste, which I blame the thick chocolate for. The donut bun was just a mediocre donut. Thicker slices of kiwi and strawberry would have been nice.",

What convinced us to eat at this place was that the booths are equipped with our own small TV. Perfect for March Madness (go KU!)  They have plenty of suggestions, but they also have crafted your own burgers. This was what we opted for.   I got their chicken sandwich with skinny fries.  I'm not a big on fries person, but skinny fries? Bring them!  As for chicken sandwich, most of the time we need condiments to add flavors. This chicken sandwich didn't need it!  I could taste the rosemary and it was juicy, glistened when I opened the bun to add onion and tomato to it.   The hubs crafted his own burger and said it was really good with his buffalo tots.   Our little one got their chicken fingers with fruits.   We just need to remind ourselves this is on the strip in Las Vegas so the tab will come out a little pricey.  4 stars is for the price although it was expected.",

The beer selection is glorious as they have large selections of Belgian and German beers.   The menu is simple and to the point. You can either build your own burger or select some of the ones they recommend. We built two burgers:   Burger 1: Country Natural Beef, Pepper Jack, Onion, Jalapeno Bacon, Fried Egg, Truffle Sauce on Onion Bun.  Burger 2: Chicken Breast, Sprouts, Fried Egg, Tomato, Button Mushrooms, Cucumber on Ciabatta.   Burger 1 was great. Highlights were the beef and Jalapeno bacon. I thought the onion bun was just okay.   Burger 2 might have been the best Chicken Burger/Sandwich that I ever tried.  Next time I'd like to save room for deserts/sweets. They have a nice selection of interesting shakes and even a beer-ice cream paddle.",

    "text": "Mmmm, burgers. One of my favorite foods.  I'm not much for fancy burgers but I made an exception for this place. I was in Vegas for a week (!) for work and stuck in Mandalay Bay. Now, I'm not saying Mandalay is bad place but a week indoors anywhere is rough. My birthday happened to fall that week so a group of about 35 of us ditched the company-sponsored festivities one night and headed to the Burger Bar in Mandalay Place to celebrate my 34th year of existence.  First, I will give the staff kudos for arranging seating for us. When 35 people roll up with no reservation, I'm sure it's not easy but my guess is the check for 35 justifies the hassle. We had to wait for a while but only because some large group with little kids was already in the place. Sidebar: Vegas is no place for a family vacation. Take your fucking kids to Disneyland, not a place famous for gambling, sex and getting piss-drunk. I don't fuck up your Legoland vacation by getting hammered and then hitting on your wife after spending $500 in a strip club so don't fuck up my vacation by bringing your hyper kids to Vegas and letting them run around while screaming their heads off. Deal?  But I digress, on to the food. I ordered the \"Hubert Keller Burger.\" I mean, it's named after the owner (and world-renowned chef) - it's gotta be the shit, right? It's actually a buffalo burger, not beef, with caramelized onions, blue cheese and baby spinach on a ciabatta bun. It was indeed the shit. One of the best burgers I have ever had, in fact. I also ate half of my boss' Kobe beef burger, also excellent. And they don't mess around when you order rare or medium-rare. You better like it bloody if you order it that way, not like those chain restaurants that are afraid to leave any pink in the meat. It makes me nervous to order food in those places. I mean, why are you afraid to serve your food a little underdone? What does that say about the quality of your ingredients?  The sides (sweet potato fries, regular fries) were good but nothing special. I wish I had ordered dessert. They had some good looking \"Sweet Burgers\" and milkshakes on the menu. Maybe next time. The beer menu is very impressive and they serve pitchers.  The service was very good. They were quick and came by often. With 35 people in the party, I was less concerned with their friendliness, I just wanted them to get the orders correct in a timely fashion, which they did. I willl definitely go back the next time I am at Mandalay.",

One thing I remember from my previous visits years ago was how the staff had a holier than thou attitude and that attitude still remains.  Chill out, it's a friggin burger joint.  I laughed at the hostess after she told me it was 20 minutes for a table for one.  When I started to walk away she alerted me that I could sit at the bar if I liked.  I happily took her up on that offer.  Lunch started with a fantastic pint of Blue Moon.  This glass of beer set things right.  It was the perfect temperature and had a substantial orange wedge.  I'd rather have too much orange than too little.  I'm the same with Corona. The beer lasted just long enough for an awesome bacon cheeseburger to arrive.  The burger was packed with one of two types of \"Jack\" cheese (I told them to surprise me and I don't remember which I had) and accompanied by a side of skinny fries.  The burger was prepared medium and was nice and juicy.  The bacon was fantastic and, although I'm not much of a fry guy, the fries were nice, crisp and tasty.

Fries and Onion rings above average. Total bill was $170 for 6 of us including drinks and gratuity.  If you are looking for a fun night out with friends or want to try this place once I would rec it. If you are just looking to satisfy your burger fix I would go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Food-wise, this place is okay. I mean, it may be a little overrated for \"gourmet\" burgers, but it's almost worth it.   I was, however, absolutely appalled at their service standards here. My friend and I had dinner here tonight and ordered a split of champagne they were offering as a special or highlight or whatever. After realizing it was not what we expected, we tried sending it back, only half expecting them to take it off the bill.   Maybe it's their policy to try to comp as little as possible, but the entire situation was handled extremely poorly. Both my friend and I are involved in the fine dining food and beverage industry in one way or another, we are well aware of how most good restaurants on the strip will bend over backwards to make customers happy. Instead of apologizing and/or offering some kind of compensation for the dissatisfaction, the manager came out and proceeded to argue with us for a good 10 minutes about their general policy about unsatisfactory items, and as long as nothing was technically wrong with the product (i.e. spoiled or whatever) they wouldn't do anything else about the situation. And then he had the nerve to tell us about how he would only take it off the bill if we were going to leave \"extremely unhappy\", and that he was already losing money on the sale as it was. This, after a bottle of champagne was sitting out at room temp for over 20 minutes, becoming warm and flat. After a while we just got tired of all the arguing and told him to do what he had to do, paid the bill, and left.    Needless to say he's lost at least 2 repeat customers, not to mention our significant others and countless number of friends who I'll make sure will never go here.",

Tried the surf and turf burger with bacon.  Burger was good, maybe a little underseasoned.  Lobster was a tad bit over cooked.  Wish it were grilled instead of steamed Bun was good.  The kicker on this burger was asparagus.  Surprisingly good!  Overall the burger was a bit dry, could have benefitted from some sort of sauce.  This place cooks its burgers to steak temps which maybe a little rare for a lot of people.  The fries were the most disappointing part of the meal.  The skinny fries came with my meal.  They tasted very generic.  they were the type that has that crispy coating(potato flour I think)  But they were uninspired for a a burger joint.  Thought in/n/out's fries blew these away.  Not too expensive for a celebrity chef joint.",

Sometimes you just want to say \"no more buffets\" and just get a good piece of meat between 2 pieces of bread. This wasn't just a piece of meat though. Being my first kobe beef burger ever, I had to order it medium rare. I usually order bacon with my burger, but oh no, not on this one. Oh,  this thing is a piece of art, I tell you. I took a moment as it sit there daring me to pick it up and eat it. But no, as if to torture myself a few minutes more knowing that relief is right in front of me (almost like when you want to take a shit so bad, u finally reach a toilet bowl, u hold it in just a few seconds longer). I sit there admiring this man made creation. I could kiss the chef in th ass. It was beyond delicious. While you're there, go on and order the Nutella milkshake, holy moly. It's just beyond amazing. Oh, and people who gave this place less than 4 stars didn't order the Kobe burger, haha.",

Ummmmm DELISH!!! we tried to get something different everytime and it was never bad, in fact it was amazing. the kobe burger, i want to drive four hours just to eat it. my boyfriend is a health nut with a burger weakness and is now obsessed with the buffalo burger.

My boyfriend customized a Natural Burger(?) with Swiss cheese and portabella mushroom on a wheat bun with a side of onion rings, while I customized my Kobe Burger with mozzarella, caramelized onions, and garlic aioli on a sesame bun, and I got mine with a side of sweet potato fries.  Now, don't get me wrong. These were good burgers. But there was nothing more to it. They were good, but not exceptional. We were expecting in-your-face goodness but the burgers certainly failed to meet that expectation, considering the chef's reputation. Quite honestly, Umami in LA has better burgers; the patties are incredibly juicy at Umami. For what the Burger Bar is charging, i.e. anywhere from $10 ~ $16 for a burger that comes with fries, or $16~$21 customized burger and sides, they need to do better than what they are serving now.   The only things that were memorable were the garlic aioli and the onion rings; other than that, I would consider this place as \"been there, done that\" and something that I have checked off my list, but do not expect to visit again.",

    "text": "I guess I was pretty lucky.  The three of us got here on a late Monday afternoon and there was no wait at all.  Since I was at Hubert Keller's Burger Bar...I wanted the full experience.  Burger, skinny fries, sweet potato fries and a strawberry shake.   I swear my meal was 3000 calories in itself!  Hopefully what happens in Vegas, will stay in Vegas.  I had to walk off the extra weight afterwards!      I wanted to order the $60 Kobe beef burger with foie gras and shaved truffles...but that seemed a little extravagent for a late lunch.  Also, build your own burgers always seem to fail me.  There are always too many options and I tend to add too much to my burger.  So I decided to keep it simple and I ordered the sliders.  I figured it was the best way to sample 3 different burgers.  The first was the American Classic which consisted of cheese, sliced tomato, lettuce & pickle.  The second consisted of bacon and the third had caramelized onions.  Honestly, I couldn't tell the difference of which patty was Kobe beef, Buffalo and Ridgefield Farm beef.  They were supposed to be cooked to medium, but it was well done when I got them.  The patties were a little on the cold side and a little dry.  Also, I didn't like the bun on these sliders at all.  I prefer a moist, soft bun.  These were not.  If there is a next time, I'll have to order a regular sized burger.",

    "text": "So here's the thing about Burger Bar: you have to believe that a $15-$30 burger can be worth the money.  I know what you're thinking: \"No f-ing way.\"  Well, that's fine.  I used to be like you: uneducated, unknowing.  Unenlightened.  And then I went, and my eyes were opened to the top of the burger world.  First, you gotta choose your meat: you can get Angus, Kobe, hell, even Buffalo and Vegetarian.  Then you choose your toppings, and this is where the fun starts.  You like lobster?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Kobe burger.  You like shrimp?  Bam!  Throw it on top of your Buffalo burger.  You like lobster AND shrimp?  Bam!  You're crazy.  But you can throw both of them on top of your Angus.  They've got different kinds of bacon, different kinds of lettuce, cheese, mushrooms... hell, they even have shaved truffles, which launches your burger into the price stratosphere.  Somehow, everything is cooked so well that it all goes together, even if you've got a Vegetarian burger topped with eggs, asparagus, and applewood bacon.  Then you have sides.  They have a great selection of those, too.  Normal fries, sweet potato fries.... they're wonderfully crisp with just enough of the potato matter.  My personal favorite is the fried zucchini; way better than anything you'll get at a carnival or random schmuck burger joint.  The decor is pretty nice; it's sort of like a gentrified sports bar.... that occasionally serves $65 burgers with truffles.  But it's comfortable, warm and inviting, with tons of wood bars, tables, and booths.  I haven't really had a chance to try the beers, as I think I'm usually too busy stuffing my face.  Anyway, give it a shot.  I never thought a $25 burger could be worth it, but they've made a True believer out of me.",

You can get some high class truffles and stuff like that.   Sides are decent.   If you're too lazy to think up of something original, the chef has a menu set to pick from.    There's a full bar, but a BIG plus is the beer menu.  They have an extensive import selection.  Stuff you don't see anywhere.  I got a Delirius and a Lambic Apple Cider Ale from the Belgium menu.  Some good stuff.   Ahhhh, beer.",

I can honestly say that their kobe burger(named after the great Kobe Bryant.  lol jp) is the best damn burger I have eaten in my 25 years of existence. Prior to dining at this gem, I'd be damned if I would pay 20 bucks for a slab of beef between a bun. But I've never had hamburger meat literally melt in my mouth. DamN!  I'd gladly pay it over and over again if I werent 300 miles away   =(  The salmon burger is the bomb too!",

A small group of us were there for my friend's birthday and I had the Hubert Keller Burger with buffalo, baby spinach, blue cheese, caramelized onions, a shallot reduction sauce on a ciabatta bun.... um... AMAZING! I've never had buffalo before and found it very flavorful and lean. The shallot reduction sauce was a little underwhelming and kinda made the burger a big mess.... but a delicious mess!  Remember... it is Las Vegas so it is a bit pricey.... my burger was about $20, but worth it for Vegas. You spend $20 on a spin at the roulette table so why not for an amazing burger.   Also had some onion rings and fried zucchini which was great. Some of the best fried zucchini I've ever had. They have a HUGE beer selection which I loved... had a amber ale which was perfect with the burger.   Our server was great.... very prompt and always had a smile. The hostess however, seemed like she checked out for the day. While she was physically there and seated us quickly, she had -0- personality.  This is definitely on my list of places to return to when I'm in Vegas :)",

    "text": "Went here one night for dinner, ordered the American Burger and a Fat Tire.  Instead of the regular fries, ordered the sweet potato fries.  My friend ordered the Kobe Burger and Onion Rings and an Alcoholic Mint Shake.  Overall, we felt that the meal was just so-so.  My burger was pretty much your typical burger with cheese, bacon, lettuce, tomato, etc. His burger was a little more tender than mine, but still nothing to rave about.  His shake was supposed to have alcohol in it, but who knows if there was any actually in there.  You cant really go wrong with a Fat Tire.   When we went, it was about dinner time, so they were pretty crowded.  We were told there was about a 20 min wait, unless we wanted to sit at the bar.  We were starving so we elected to sit at the bar only to walk to the back to find that the only seats open were the last 2, one of which is IN the walkway for the servers to get to the kitchen.  We ended up sitting there, where we noticed that almost the whole back half of the restaurant was empty.  Apparently they werent seating in that area because they didnt have enough servers.  That sucks.  One good thing about this place was conveniently located in a mall, so you can walk off all the food you just ate, or browse the shops while you wait for your table.  This is your typical burger and beer place, and I probably wouldnt recommend the alcoholic shakes.  Id stick to the regular shakes for half the price.  Another good thing about this restaurant is that you can build your burger however you want it. A definite plus for those picky eaters, or the people who like everything under the sun on their burgers.",

    "text": "We waited 50 min for dinner on a Sunday, but were able to easily distract ourselves and make the wait go faster by visiting the neighboring mall stores.  The wait was well worth it; you'll have to study the menu for a while to figure out what to order because not only is there a wide selection of burgers and drinks/shakes to choose from, but there's a million different combos of burgers you can customize.  Luckily, they have a page of specialty burgers so that you don't have to make those tough decisions.  I stayed simple and picked the organic-y, grass-fed beef burger cooked medium-rare on wheat and added only swiss cheese, tomato, and sprouts (I wanted to be able to fit the burger in my mouth).  I probably shouldn't have ordered anything else because I couldn't finish it.  But what did we decide to do?  Since there were four of us, we each can order four different type of french fries and all try each others' fries!  Fat fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, and seasoned fries, I think.  A few more people at our table and we probably would have ordered the rest of the types of fries on the menu.  The fries were good entertainment (and too filling), but clearly the burgers are the superstar here!  Unless you have a huge appetite or order JUST a burger (hard to do given the wide menu selection), you'll probably need to take some to go.  Don't overlook the drink/shakes section.  They serve alcoholic milkshakes here, like a \"French Kiss\" (Vanilla ice cream, Godiva liqueur, Kahlua, chocolate) or an \"Irish Coffee\" (Coffee ice cream, Kahlua, Jameson, Caramel, Chocolate syrup, Chocolate coffee beans).  And don't just drink a Guinness beer.  Have a Guinness BEER FLOAT (Guinness, Coffee ice cream).  If you're more of a Blue Moon beer person, they toss in Raspberry Sorbet into a glass of Blue Moon.  What a great way to kill two birds with one stone (having a drink and eating dessert).  Learn from my mistakes; leave room for the Alcoholic Milkshakes and/or Beer Floats.  I didn't and now I probably will have to make an excuse to visit Vegas yet again to try another burger variation and finish it off with an Alcoholic Milkshake!",

Our server was friendly and efficient.    Orders in our group of 6 included 3 of the Kobe burgers, 1 angus burger, 1 natural beef burger, and one salmon burger.  We shared an order of skinny fries (good, but nothing special), sweet potato fries (good), and onion rings (very good).  Everybody enjoyed their food immensely.  I had the natural beef burger, cooked a really nice medium, with jack cheese, guac, and caramelized onions (which the waitress suggested when I said that I needed something else on my burger).  Mmmm.  Very good beer selection--both on tap and in bottles.  Two people got milkshakes (non-alcoholic ones).  I got a taste of the nutella shake and it was terrific; really, really thick and chocolaty.  Will certainly remember Burger Bar for future visits to Vegas!",

But overpaying for food of humble origins is just part of that Vegas thing for good or ill and I have long made peace with it. The place is accurate in it's name as a bar because the size of the place I feel plays a factor in the long lines. Vegas is about huge volumes of people and this place is smaller then allot of restaurants around the strip so planning accordingly goes a long way to starving less. Personally I say what breaks this place apart from great places I have had burgers is not so much that its miles better. But rather the options to assemble your perfect burger is staggering and the possible combinations equally so. Think of it as your one shot to make a burger in your image and then devour it like a hungry god and you get the idea of this place. If your just ordering a regular burger that you think will surpass the regular burgers back home it might be able to but not by huge margins.",

We get our bill and split it with cash and a card. Guess that was too much for her to calculate. She comes back with my card and over charged me by 20$. So she takes it back and then does it again. So me being nice and thinking she might've had a bad day, I ignore it and give the extra 10 now that she over charged me and would leave it as a tip. She explains to me that the over charge would be off in a few days. I get home yesterday and check my account and come to find out that she had charged me for the full bill between my self my wife and her 2 friends and took the 40$ in cash for herself.

We were waiting to go grab the luggage and hit a cab to the airport, but neede3d some grub.  I'm not a fan of anything in the Luxor so we headed over to Mandalay.  The service was *eh* but I love being able to put all sorts of different things on a burger!  Yummy!  Choices of cheese and veggies!?  If only they didn't charge $1 or $2 for each item I could have made them like I do at home.  But seriously, $1 for guac and $2 for fresh avocado?  I think my partner got more guacamole on hers than my sad little piece of avocado.  And then I'm adding a whole extra star for having Shiner Bock on tap!!!  It's hard enough to find it in Chicago, and I sure wasn't expecting to see it on a beer list on vacation!  Thanks for ending our trip on a high note!",

You can also add on stuff such as cheese and grilled onions for $1 more each to truffles which were about $30 extra to add on.   The sweet potato fries were a bit addicting, but the regular fries were just like Burger King french fries.  Nothing special.  The service was friendly and fairly responsive.  I liked the atmosphere, and there's even a television embedded into the wall at the table you sit at, too bad I couldn't change the channel not that I paid much attention to the telvision anyways.  If you have the money, why not.  The burgers are nice and big.",

Better than a Carl's Junior $6 burger but far below a decent back yard BBQ. The boyfriend and I shared a buffalo burger and sweet potato fries. It was ok, nothing special. No special seasonings or expert cooking or fine meat. No one at our table of 6 said \"wow that is a tasty burger\" well one person did but she eats everything and it was her idea to come here. And even she mentioned a back yard burger would have been better. I generally go to restaurants because they cook better than me. So for the cost of our burger I think I will buy some Worcestershire sauce, a package of ground beef and have a little something left over to make up for the cab fare we wasted coming to this place.",

I got a migraine while waiting outside so long so when we were seated at a table in a noisy area I asked for a booth because they were a little enclosed, I was told we would have to wait another 10 at least. I told them I need to order a drink to take my medicine and couldn't wait any longer. we were told once we received something we couldn't change seats. so when our waitress came and I expressed my opinion she went to find the manager whom I told what happened. they gave me my drink then let us move tables. the food was just ok, the prices a bit high, I liked the burger bar at NEW YORK NEW YORK much better. we went there twice and perfect both times!",

First, I was somewhat disappointed at the selection of burgers.  For some reason I thought there would be more exotic meats like venison, or wild boar, or ostrich.  I ended up getting the Wagyu Burger.  While the burger was pretty good I'm not sure that ground Wagyu makes that much of a difference.  What really impressed me was the zucchini fries.  The seasoning on the breading was da bomb!  There was a large list of toppings for your burger but I honestly don't know that I wouldn't rather be at In N Out.",

I ordered it medium rare, but it turned up pretty rare. Seems like they err on the rare side here. Beer selection was fantastic, with a good range of belgian as well as american beers. I had a delerium noel yesterday, which was awesome. Like the delerium tremens, but smoother and sweeter. Might have been the last bottle, but they've got plenty more.",

That was awesome, cuz that meal I was totally feeling veges not meat...

My bf and I ordered an angus burger (medium rare and medium) with tons of toppings: pickled green tomatoes with a hint of jalapeno minus the spice, spinach, bacon, cheese, chipotle sauce, avocado, etc. (for two burgers). He ordered fried zucchini while I ordered sweet potato fries. He ordered a root beer while I ordered a root beer float. Each burger comes with the standard lettuce, tomatoes and onions on the side. We would've ordered kobe beef if it was from Japan. All the meats are farm grown though so it just tastes THAT much better. Highly recommended before you go on a diet. Meal was about 25 per person. Can't believe I inhaled my burger. My bf had to eat faster just to keep up. That's a first!",

Although his other restaurant Fleur (located in the same building downstairs) was somewhat disappointing, the Burger Bar served the best burgers I have ever eaten. I ordered the Hubert Keller burger the first time, and it was delicious. The sweet caramelized onion sauce that came with it was perfect, and the medium rare buffalo patty was cooked to retain the optimal moistness. My dad let me try a bite of his American Classic, also medium rare, and it tasted even better than my burger! I loved this restaurant so much I came here for lunch again days later. Unfortunately, I did not have as great of an experience. I ordered the American Classic, and also I still call for it to be medium rare, it was much dryer than before. I asked for grilled onions instead of raw onions, but they still gave me raw. I called sweet potato fries both times, but they were less crunchy the second time. The service also felt less attentive than it had during the preceding visit. With that said, the Burger Bar still remains my favorite burger place, and I would definitely return on my next visit to Las Vegas.",

Burgers were cooked to order but relatively small (the bun was bigger than the burger). Taste was just okay (we have much better in LA) fries were pedestrian, service was dead slow (this was a late lunch and not a lot of folks in the place over the Christmas weekend!).    We tried friends' burgers as well, but no one seemed thrilled with their food. Consensus was, \"We really don't need to remember where this is; I doubt we'll be back.\"",

There is a lure to being able to customize everything on your burger, especially at a pretty decent price.   I'm not a vegetarian, but always interested in trying different takes on the veggie burger.. so trying to be adventurous i went with it! it was really tasty - a nice blend of veggies and rice, grilled to have a nice bite to it. Sadly, our waitress was not on here game that day and kept forgetting certain add-ons. I still feel if I got my avocados in my burger it would have really made it! oh well... the fried zucchini fries somewhat made up for it.   I definitely need to come back and try a 'real' burger since it seemed like everyone devoured theirs.",

I like this place because it has a old school/new school burger joint look to it. They have a huge beer list and my server allowed me to taste three different beers before choosing the one I wanted which was nice. I went the Rossini Burger which is the grand daddy of all the burgers they serve. It was named after a XIXth century Italian composer whose love for fine food was legendary. Its Kobe Beef, sauteed foie gras and shaved truffles all on a onion bun with a side of a rich brown madeira sauce. It comes with a choice of fries, I chose the sweet potato fries, and a choice of a desert burger, I chose the PB&J!    The burger was absolutely amazing. I ordered medium and it came out perfect. It was very juicy and the flavors all pair well with each other. The truffles add a very nice earthy taste to it as the foie gras adds a nice richness to it. Surprisingly I was able to eat it with out it coming apart. The fries are were very good as well. I'm a huge sweet potato fan and like how they have different type fries to choose from. The PB&J desert burger is peanut butter mousse, raspberry jelly and sliced kiwi's all in the middle of a warm glazed donut. Its VERY rich but VERY good. The kiwi adds a nice refreshing taste to it which it needs with the richness of the peanut butter and the donut.   The Burger Bar has a wide-range of choices and will satisfy your burger craving while in Las Vegas. I will be back to try some more of Hubert Keller's crazy burger creations.",

When you have to resort to pulling out a knife and fork to eat a burger, you're putting in more work than necessary.  It can all be blamed on a lack of a bun.  Using two portabello mushrooms to mimic a bun sounds good in theory, but is outright disastrous when executed.  Vegetarians at least have one other option, the Chef's Veggie Burger, which sounds more safe (i.e., less messy).  Because of their quality ingredients, classy styling, and multitude of options, Burger Bar is on a whole 'nother level, and can't be compared to typical burger joints.  Had it not been for their excellent sweet potato fries, the rating would've been a solid three.  The price wasn't too bad without any extras, but was still more than I would ever think of paying for a burger--a veggie one, no less.  The service was top notch and upbeat.  Burger Bar is highly worth a revisit, if only for their SPFs.",

More like mushy rice mess that sends my taste buds packing.   The sweet potato fries are delicious. One of the people in our party ordered the kobe beef/foie gras burger (aka Rossini), which was just ok. I seriously doubt it was worth the $60 price tag, but it came with a free dessert. We chose the chocolate burger, which is a warm donut (as the bun) with chocolate ganache as the meat patty and a slice of jellied passionfruit as a cheese slice. This was awesome. I would come back JUST for the dessert burgers.",

He got bacon, pineapple, cheddar, and spicy ketchup. He was very happy with his choice. I, however, was kind of disappointed with mine. I got caramelized onions, the red wine reduction sauce, and cheddar. The sauce, which I thought would be amazing because it was supposed to be like a 'signature' sauce and it cost like 3$ was totally bland! I was counting on it for a lot of flavor, and it totally disappointed. The burger was fine, but nothing special.

That's right, i just told you to order a $75 hamburger.  C'mon, you're in Vegas, what's $75?  a few hands of blackjack?  Wouldn't you rather eat something that you will never forget as long as you live?

Normally I dip my burger in some kind of sauce but this time I just enjoyed that meat flavor from my burger. Ahhh I want another one now!",

    "text": "Crazy delicious hamburgin' to be had at this restaurant.  Hmm, what can I tell you that the twenty jillion previous dudes haven't? I'll make an attempt at some useful insight.  I order the angus burger medium and it's cooked melt in your mouth perfectly, with the proper thickness and pink throughout. You can get it with other crazy meats, but honestly it's not as good as the regular style with the angus beef. I just prefer to let the hamburger do what it do. The Kobe and costlier alternatives are nice if you want something different, but I highly recommend the OG variant.  The sweet potato and regular fries are simply real good, and not unnecessarily fancified. It's also an excellent place to drink delicious beer, as they have many micros like Dogfish Head 60 minute and 90 minute at a decent price. I believe the cost is every bit worth it for what you get here, at the Mandalay Bay no less. There are a lot worse things you can spend your money on in Vegas, trust me.",

The fact that we received great service at a high end burger joint with kids present was awesome.  The waitress informed my girls that the kids burger was called a Crabby Patty.  Whether True or not she had the kids in her back pocket.  My wife ordered the low carb burger both times.  Being a carb addict I didn't want to admit it, but it was better than my first attempt at build a burger.  The token salad on the side had amazing dressing, my guess is there are truffles.  The low carb facade was thrown out the door when she ordered the Twinkie shake.  The Twinkie outshined my Nutella Shake which was a little to chocolaty.  My second attempt was just gooey goodness.  Kobe, Jalapeno Bacon, Truffle sauce, Provolone & spinach w/ Chipotle Aioli on a Ciabbatta bun.  ***ORDER the beer float sampler.  My wife doesn't like beer that much but even she enjoyed it.  It was the perfect amount for 4 people.  Rasberry was by far the best. *****",

    "text": "Bumped up to 5 Stars Because I had Impeccable Service and a Burger that made me wipe both sides of my mouth.. before taking a bite!!  Sat at the bar: (for like 2 hours)  Round 1: (Under Chef's Burgers with skinny fries) American Classic: \"Black Angus beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on sesame bun.\" Absolutely Delicious Angus, cooked right on my prefered medium well, bacon thin but not much fat and toppings fresh. Only thing that could use a slight improvement would be adding a slightly larger/taller Sesame Bun (because the patty isn't small, a little more bread would be a plus).. With that said, Its still was an Excellent Burger!! The fries were like McDonald's skinny but weren't as salty and had a plain potato fry flavor.. No complaints.    Round 2: American Kobe Beef Burger and fat fries: \"This american kobe beef from Snake River melts in your mouth, tender with an unmatched flavor, the most expensive beef in the world for the most discriminating palate.\" Who in the right state of mind would read this on a menu and not want to order At Least One ??!!.. As much as I wanted to try the \"Hubert Keller Burger\" or add some truffle or foie gras toppings to this burger as I planned before I made this trip, I got sucked in their brilliant description of marketing genius of having this burger Alone! I ordered it plain (coooked medium plus) to indulge its full flavor without being bloody or burnt and without any support of sauces, toppings and even cheese. I've had kobe in the past but this particular kobe patty was AMAZING! It wasn't too rich or velvety but just had and an INCREDIBLY saturated Fatty & Buttery Flavor that was Beyond Comparison of any Angus Beef Burger I've ever had. Now, this isn't the type of burger I would eat on a regular basis like I would an Angus. Because I feel this is more of a Real Treat like Gourmet or having truffle, foie gras, uni, eggs nest.. Just my opinion. Nonetheless, Definitely one of the Best Burgers I've had in my life, Bar None! The fat fries had the same flavor as the skinny but I liked these better, I personally prefer fatter sliced fries and more undercooked than crispy.   * I ordered the Beer Sampler (6) different Beers to choose from domestic/imported: I'll cut right to the chase - \"Humboldt Brown Hemp Ale (USA)\".. Your welcome =)  Service was 10.0/10.0, I Felt Special. I must of exchanged words with 5 different staff members including the manager in regards to anything that I needed to make my dining experience any better and some interesting conversations that set a nice vibe.. Atmosphere was relaxed and live at the same time (sports games were playing and some indiviudals cheering, but not annoyingly loud). Both Burgers were Memorable and absolutely worth every penny.   *For those of you that felt their burgers were mediocre at most, Please advise me of a Burger that you obviously feel that's More Worthy.",

The Kobe beef burger is...um...well it's making my mouth water just thinking about it...\r \r The Burger Bar offers a wide variety of burger choices, but the real fun is in the topping choices (ranging from the ordinary: tomatoes, pickles, onions...to the extreme: lobster, black truffles!!!).\r \r Good drink choices (quite a few beers on tap) and wonderful homemade fountain sodas.  Excellent sweet potato french fries.  \r \r My favorite there, however, must be the \"Chocolate Burger\" dessert.  It's a warm glazed donut sliced in half (to look like a hamburger roll), a round slab of chocolate grenache, fresh strawberries, fresh mint, mango gelatin and raspberry syrup.

Come on! Tell me that you're not impressed!  A toaster, microwave and hotplate!? I was proud of myself for just mastering the microwaving of the cup of noodle.  Yet, Chef Keller made an amazing meal that looked good enough for me to fork out urber $$$$! This man's food looked amazing,  sOOOo AMAZING that I wanted to experience his flavor profile first hand @ Burger Bar.   The menu at Burger Bar consisted of built your own burger, a few chef's burgers, sandwiches and salads and desserts.  After the constant pestering from the waitress, I finally decided to make my own burger.  There are no directions/recommendations for the ingredients on the menu.  For example, it should say: \"pick your cheese, pick your sauce, pick your veggies, pick your toppings.\"   I was overwhelmed with the list of ingredients, but chose:   Black Angus Beef Baby Spinach Caramelized Onion Peppered Jack Portobello Mushrooms. Ciabatta Bun   My burger was aiight. The caramelized onion and Portobello mushrooms tasted yummy. The Angus beef was dry and needed more seasoning. I had to pour ketchup on the beef to add more flavor. The bun was whatever. Overall, I was just not impressed!  Chef Keller, I want to experience your flavor profile, not mine! Your awarding dishes look and sound amazing! I don't want to build my own burger! If I wanted to build my own burger, I could make it at home. I understand that you had Chef's Burgers like the American Classic, but, Ridgefield farm beef, American Cheese, Crisp bacon tomato did not excite me!  The Rossini did sound amazing, but @ $60 a pop, I rather save my $$ for Fleur De Lys. You are an amazing chef. Just because Burger Bar is a lower end restaurant does not mean it should have lower quality!   Burger Bar needs to live up to the Hubert Keller name and it doesn't.",

My best friend had her heart set on getting dolled up and having a sophisticated dinner at Mix, another Mandalay Bay restaurant.    My other friend and I took a look at Mix's menu, its prices and agreed we were still going to be hungry afterwards.  So she came up with an ingenious idea of going to Burger Bar (she saw it highlighted on Rachael Ray's Tasty Travels show) before our formal dinner.  We managed to slip away from the group, ordered the Black Jack Burger to go and chowed down in the privacy of our room. Shhhh!!  I had my second dinner, ate teeny tiny and everyone was a happy camper at the end of the day.  My best friend's boyfriend came by our room later, spotted the Burger Bar bag and gave us so much crap for not inviting him along.  Well to his credit, he never ratted us out and to this day she doesn't know know about our trip to Burger Bar!",

When we got there on Saturday night, there was a short wait, so we decided to sit at the bar.  Great decision.  The bartender was so incredibly nice (and looked like a prettier version of Jennifer Lopez).  She served up our beverages and promptly took our orders.  I ordered the buffalo burger with grilled onions, portobello mushrooms, and pepper jack cheese.  My husband ordered the grilled chicken sandwich w/ pepper jack and grilled onions.  We shared the sweet potato fries.  My buffalo burger was amazing.  I wanted to eat the whole thing but had to resist since I knew it was not in my best interest.  It was juicy and full of flavor.  I was surprised how generous they were with the portobellos, since it was only a dollar addition.  My husband raved about the chicken sandwich, too.  The sweet potato fries were killer.  They were the best sweet potato fries because they had the perfect consistency of crispiness and potato softness on the inside.    I highly recommend sitting at the bar and grabbing burgers and drinks anytime you are in Vegas.  We seriously could have split one and probably will next time.  Sit at the bar and the service will be great, too.",

We went on a Wednesday night, not 'peak' Vegas season or anything, it was busy, we waited over 40 minutes for food - and with my 3 year old, that does not work. When we got our food, it was not cooked. My husband asked for medium - I think they showed that patty the grill and that was it. I like medium well on a burger, it was barely medium. There was a long period of time where I didn't see ANY food coming out of the kitchen.  As for the taste. It was ok. I had an angus burger, on ciabatta with jalapeno bacon and guacamole. Not great. Sweet potato fries were great. My 3 year old had the chicken strips from the kids menu, those were pretty standard.  I would not come back. I can tolerate a lot of things, but not impossibly slow service and uncooked food. The waiter was nice enough, but to be honest, the PIZZA SLICE place around the corner seemed like THE place to be. Packed, loud and everyone looked happy. I don't like pizza but.. it looked pretty good.",

A wonderful variety of beers on tap (most I have fund in Vegas anyway) and an impressive selection of bottles from around the world!

We had seen Hubert Keller on TV showing us how to make a few different burgers but what caught our attention was the veggie burger.  We thought hmm that sounds pretty good and then forgot about it.  Because who is gonna make just a little bit of rice, lentils, and the several other ingredients it takes to make the patty?  Easier to go to the Burger Bar and order it.    I loved it and it was only eight dollars, hands down the cheapest burger on the menu.   My sister in law had the Angus Beef burger with bacon and blue cheese and was very happy with her choice.  We shared sampling of sweet potato fries, fried zucchini strips, regular fries, and fried onion rings.  Even though it was fried nothing seemed greasy.  You can pick special condiments you want but they charge you for it or you can just use the bottle of ketchup and mustard on the table.  We got a ranch dressing, a spicy mayo that wasn't so spicy, and a homemade ketchup which was a bit spicy.   I don't how much the total was because my sister in law picked up the tab.  I enjoyed my meal and liked the fact that I got to try Hubert Keller's recipe.  I expect that his cooks have been trained to execute it to his standards and that the ingredients are high end.",

But after eating here on numerous occasions, I think I finally got it down pat.  I've been hooked on Burger Bar since day one.  I make it an effort to eat here at least once on all my Vegas trips (approximately 7 trips since).  The minute I touch McCarran Airport I make a beeline straight to Mandalay.  Is it that great?  Umm, yes and no.  It can be, you just gotta get the combos right.  Like I said before, it's very easy to go overboard on the toppings and just get it wrong.    You have the choice of ordering their pre-made selections or create your own.  Picking a bun, meat and fixin's can be perplexing.  Like me, you easily get lured into exotic items such as black truffles, lobster and foie gras.  I made that mistake in the beginning and my burgers came out tasting like a garbage disposal.  So many things mashed together, it was a complete mess.  Not only that, it  was a costly Frankenstein experiment... ranging upwards of $65 a burger.  Yeah, it adds up quick.    It wasn't until a couple of years ago that I stumbled upon a winning combination.  Plain bun, American Kobe (cooked medium rare), Lobster, American & Swiss cheese, Grilled Asparagus or sprouts, pickles and pesto.  Not too crazy, other than the lobster.  Eating that silky luxurious lobster tail is what drives me back.  It's that one ingredient that makes this burger gourmet!  It ain't cheap, but for $30 it gets my karma amped up to the highest notch.  All these nuances of flavor are working in every bite... sweet, savory, sour... mmm mmm mmm.  It's a feast on a bun!  Come early, there's going to be a wait.  If you get a chance, order the Butttermilk battered Zucchini fries and the Peanut Butter and Jelly Burger for dessert.  OMG... BANANAS!",

    "text": "I wanted a bloody, rare burger. And that's what I got. I'm pretty sure I could hear my burger moo at me when I bit into it. Dripping in juice...so good. And yes.. again, it was so yummily rare.    Don't worry - all y'all who are afraid of a lil pink, my friends got their burgers medium and no moos coming from their burger.  Tons of burgers to choose from OR opt for the build your own burger variety.  They even have an oh-so-indulgent kobe beef burger!    I got the country natural burger, added on a fried egg, bacon, and provolone.  In all honesty, I wanted to go all out and add truffles and truffle sauce, and foie gras, but I was trying to be good.  Even with me 'sacrificing', that burger was amazing. When I ordered my burger rare.. it came RARE. I love that. I love ordering meat rare and it being done right.  It totally tickled my burger fancy.   My friends got their burger - and I wish I could tell you what was on theirs - but I was so involved in my own bloody burger goodness that I just didn't notice.    We also shared the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries.  The sweet potato fries were good - albeit, perhaps the least amazing part of the whole meal - and the zucchini fries were delicious!!! Soft and crunchy at the same time. All that washed down with a yummy Spaten Optimator beer...this whole meal made me one very happy girl.  Wait...that's not all. We ended the meal sharing a mint chocolate chip milkshake made with a mint liqueur. Amazeballs, I tell you.  We were so full we were convinced we'd only sip some and take no more. But it was so good, we forced our fat asses to keep going...and we regret not one sip of it.    Sat at the bar, didn't have to wait for a table, and the bartender/waitress was super awesome and nice.  So, my verdict? Burger Bar = happy lil me.",

I had a standard burger with cheddar for $14.95 and will grade that an \"A.\"  Where they lose stars is on beer prices... I asked for an IPA and got the old standard Lagunitas.  It came in a 22 ounce bottle which is a bit unusual.  I ended up ordering two because I had some time to waste.  Then the bill comes and each beer is $16 -- more than the burger.  I always hate restaurants that do this, and yes there are a lot out there so I should know better.",

We watched burgers, fries and wings just sit up at the expedition window for longer than a restaurant should allow. We were so hungry by the time they brought us out our aged buyers that we said nothing. They were over cooked and pretty much something you could have expected at a Chili's or Applebee's but at doubled the cost. I'd skip it all together, unless they were your only choice. you're better off grabbing fast food a couple of steps further.",

All of these critiques must have been completed by people without taste buds, or a since of value.  I am aware that Vegas is a town perfectly designed to take your money, but this is ridiculous. The chef that has proudly placed his name on this poor excuse of a restaurant should be forced by his peers to renounce his proclamation as chef.  Seriously, I have had better burgers at Denny's.",

    "text": "3 1/2 stars. Angela suggested this place telling me she had heard it was one of the best burger places in Vegas. It's also got one of the most expensive burgers in the States. So we came meeting a friend of hers who also brought his own friend.  I got a bite of everything and actually I've uploaded a pic of my receipt. So you can see exactly what we ordered. I got the $60 burger and had them cut it into 4 pieces so we all had a bite. Angela got their spicy lamb burger, the other two ordered a peppercorn and salmon burger. I actually got a bite of all them.   Lamb burger was overcooked. Almost well done, a medium at best. Was incredibly disappointing. Not good at all and I like lamb burgers. So don't order your lamb burger anything less then medium rare. Honestly, I wouldn't recommend any beef burger less than medium rare.  The salmon burger was overcooked. Wasn't too impressed with this also. I mean both this and the lamb were like 2 stars to me, would not ever order them again. The peppercorn on the other hand was outstanding. Really strong fresh peppercorn and it's super tasty. Really liked it a lot.  Ok, so the $60 burger. The beef was cooked perfectly. Just really, really excellent and tasty. The truffles, excellent. Burger also get serves with truffle oil on the side which you should absolutely pour on top and it so enhanced the flavor of everything. So what was its weakness? The foie gras. Not enough of it. Angela has never had foie gras and she told that she couldn't taste it. Not a good sign. I'm practically French and have eaten a ridiculous amount of different types of foie gras. Yeah, certain foie gras can have an incredibly powerful taste and overwhelm anything else if too much is used and eaten at once. This burger did not have this kind of foie gras. I could physically see the foie gras and even I could barely taste it. Seriously disappointing in this but other than this, a great burger. Worth $60. No, definitely not. Maybe a $30-40 burger. Maybe, though honestly I don't think I'd ever order this burger again. I'd encourage someone else to give it a try but I'd be good.  So what really was the gem of evening? You can not only customize your burger and make any 100s of different permutations of different types of burgers here, you can also customize your own shake! This includes beer floats! But what's the True sign of a real milkshake connoisseur? I'll show you how you make a shake. So I told our waitress that whomever makes the milkshake, to customize me one. I was going to leave it to their imagination and experience. I said I'd eat anything and wasn't allergic to anything. The only thing was that I didn't want anything boring but a shake of all shakes. So it turns out, there's a guy who's dedicated to just making the shakes! How awesome is that. When he came out with my shake it was beautiful. And this is the real reason why I posted up my receipt so you can see what he put in it. I boxed my shake with a black pen so take a look! This alone will make Burger Bar a special place for me.  So overall not a bad eating experience at all. I'd definitely come back anytime.",

The burger, while cooked to \"medium rare\" was sadly dry and devoid of any seasoning.  The foie gras was undercooked and the truffles were definitely not fresh.  I was given little side dishes of salt, pepper, and perigord sauce, but even with the addition of those, the burger lacked flavor.  The fries were not very good and were something one could get at McDonald's.  I am so sad, because I was hoping this would be the best burger I have ever eaten.  For $65 dollars, it was not worth it.......I have no problem paying for great food, but this did not fall into that category.",

I knew the Buffalo Burger was going to be gamy and dry, but it was worse than I expected.  You can't have a good burger without some fat and the ciabatta just completely dried out my mouth.  Buffalo meat is just too lean and pair that with the ciabatta, well I might as well just eat a dry towel.  The dish came with a cup of what could have been Au Jus to drizzle on the burger.  Yikes.",

    "text": "I've had Burger Bar bookmarked after reading an article about the best burgers in the U.S., and finally got the chance to try it during my last Vegas round of shenanigans. My bookmark was for the Rossini burger, the most expensive item here, but I only realized that once I got home. If you're daring enough, give it a try.   I see Burger Bar as a fancier version of The Counter. I try to eat as uniquely as possible, so being able to customize my own burger immediately grabbed my attention. You have a choice of 8 meats + 1 veggie, 6 buns, and 46 toppings. If this doesn't satisfy you, nothing will.  I ended up getting the following:  Lamb Burger \"Murquez Style\" + Sesame Bun + Cheddar Cheese + Grilled Shrimp + Pesto Sauce   Where else can you get a combo like that? Upon first bite, the burger was nothing short of glorious. It's like the Vegas gods flew down from the top of the Mandalay Bay and presented me this burger on a golden platter. At that point of the night, I wasn't even drunk yet but my taste buds sent orgasmic chills throughout my whole body that had me ready to pass out from how delectable this burger was. The ground lamb is seasoned and cooked to perfection and presented to you in a pretty hefty patty. The shrimp are hefty and go together perfectly with the lamb, cheese and pesto. Whoever doesn't believe me needs to give it a try. The bun is perfectly toasted and has a slightly sweet but not distracting taste to it.  To top it off, I got the Chocolate Cowboy Milkshake, which consists of whiskey, chocolate ice cream, chocolate, and whipped cream. Simple, yet so delectable. It may be pricey but it comes in such a huge glass that you'll need to summon your friends to finish. This goes perfectly with any burger.   I don't care if my cholesterol shot through the roof that night. I'm too young to be thinking about that. As long as your taste buds are happy, your heart will be happy.",

The combinations and permutations of bread, burger, toppings, fries, sides and drinks are a True something-for-everyone, and the game is always on - TVs in the booths and a string of TVs above the bar.   Even the relatively long hike to the back-access-hallway bathroom provides a good excuse to take a necessary break from the action.  Adding a fried egg to any burger is my favorite, and the zucchini fries are a great fry alternative. The perfect place to try mixing Tabasco with Ketchup if you've never done it before.   The basic Angus beef burger patty is baseline great. The NatureSource beef patty is a few bucks more and tastes marginally healthier. Both cook up fine & juicy Medium Well if you're E-coli-conscious. The 'Kobe' beef patty comes out tasting kind of oily, so not my fave. The Lamb Burger is a solid choice, as are the Turkey Burger and the Chicken Sandwich. If it ain't right, this place is eager to make it right. Just speak up!  You really can't go wrong here. But try to go at off-times for little or no wait.

    "text": "Fantastic burgers, delicious beer, and excellent service! The hubby and I ate here one night while staying at the Luxor (which is connected to Mandalay Bay). After some Yelp-ing, we decided to give Burger Bar a try.   We stopped in on a Tuesday night and we were seated right away. The booths have a small TV with their own channel controls. I tried flipping through the channels and it became quickly apparent that they only feature sports networks/shows. I'm not really a fan, but the TVs are a nice touch if you're into sports.  The menu has a selection of around a dozen specialty burgers, or you can pick your own toppings (and protein) to build your own burger. I opted for The Greek (lamb) burger. SOOOO ridiculously good. It had just the right amount of spice and the patty was cooked to perfection. The sandwich is served on a pita which makes sense but it does result in a slightly awkward meat-to-bread ratio. I can't have a decent burger experience without a beer so I was pleasantly surprised when I perused their beverage list. Their beer selection is fairly extensive with a lot of options from local breweries.",

Aside from that, the burger was perfectly cooked, I'm a medium-well kind of guy and usually end up getting burgers that are mostly well with only a slight hint of pink, if any at all... this burger was exactly what I envisioned when I ordered medium well.  I love the option of being able to choose whatever toppings strike your fancy, they even have pre prepared \"Chef's Burgers\" that take the indecision out of it. I chose the Pepper Jack cheese, Jalapenos, Jalapeno Bacon, and caramelized onions. It was very tasty, juicy and worth the wait.  I would recommend this place to anyone who's gonna be in especially those looking for a place to eat that had great food at a reasonable price",

You're not Bobby Flay, c'mon and have some self respect), this 'build-a-burger' menu is attractive nonetheless. With upscale options such as Kobe style wagyu beef, foie gras and shallot sauce (\"Hubert's personal favorite!\" the menu touts), you really can at least feel the emphasis on fine dining. . .but it is indeed a burger place and there's no escaping that. Which is fine - because the burgers are good. Ton of options, and some interesting sides (stuffed poblanos, jalapeno onions) - at a fair price. Again, this is Hubert Keller so you'll pay more than expected (count on $16-$19 for a burger), but the flavor is there and probably one of the best burgers on the strip for whatever that's worth.   Service is notably sound, and the decor is more roadside grill than Michelin star, but that's okay. That's the environ in which I want to eat my burger.",

As a possible result I thought the burgers and fries were excellent!  Burger Bar has quite an extensive menu and our group of 6 took full advantage of that. Each person ordered something different. My burger was cooked to a perfect medium-rare; it was excellent and was very juicy. The sweet potato fries were good and hit the spot although the ranch was...eh. The others in my group seemed to enjoy their burgers, fries, and shakes. One of them had some sliders that looked very tasty.  The service was attentive and very accommodating especially considering how \"sauced\" our group was. Even though the food wasn't too greasy it really hit the spot after a LONG night at the tables. Fortunately I had enough leftover for a late night snack; tip included :)",

Even though my friend's burger was very overcooked, it was still juicy. They gave their burgers a 4 star.  Me and my other friend had the black angus burgers. I asked for medium rare and it was technically cooked alright (slightly overcooked but acceptable), however, the meat had zero juice and no flavor. I had smoked gouda (one small slice) and caramelized onions on mine and the onions were the overwhelming flavor. I felt like I was eating cardboard with onions--my burger would rate a zero star.   Before ordering I asked the waitress what was the difference between the two burger meats and which one had the most flavorful. She said the angus had more flavor--WRONG. It was tasteless.  The garlic fries were excellent.   The $10 wine was served in a very small glass. Get beer instead.",

    "text": "After a hard day's work at a convention floor - my officemates decided on eating here for dinner. I saw that they had a Veggie Burger, so I was content with eating here. There was a 15 minute wait when we got there around 1900 on a Thursday evening, so we just waited outside. 15 minutes does pass by quickly while strolling around the strip mall, and soon enough, we were seated at a booth. Our waitress offered drinks, which I decided on a beer.   One thing on the menu is how there are many options, ranging from all sorts of protein, ranging from beef, chicken, salmon, lamp, buffalo, or even Kobe Style, not to mention the house veggie style. There's even assorted bun types  (including gluten free) and a half page of toppings to consider. Talk about options, and letting my mind go nuts with all of the variables to consider.  I settled on getting the house veggie burger, with a potato bun, and sweet potato fries. Check out my pictures to see what it looks like. :-) The veggie burger was moist and tasty. The texture of the patty was offset by the texture of a perfectly toasted bun, with spicy ketchup and jalapenos.  A good amount of textural contrast, along with flavor contrast as well. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal, and it was a nice way to end the evening.  However, one of my officemates decided to go all out and try the $60 Rossini Burger. Upon first bite of this burger, he was filled with glee and happiness. So much pleasure in enjoying a burger comprising of Kobe Style Wagyu beef from Australia, accompanied with foie gras, shaved truffles,  black perigord Truffle sauce. I mean - there was a lot of taste in that burger. The waitress herself said (and I agree with her) that, if you ever stop here, try this burger. It's all about the experience, not about the money. Just try it once, and then savor the experience forever.   Next time I'm in Vegas, I will strongly consider eating this Rossini Burger, just for the experience.   Service was top notch! Waters were kept filled, offered additional beers when it was warranted, overall, just checked-in on everyone while the entire restaurant was very busy.   ==Tip== Access to the bathroom is way in the far back of the restaurant; go past the second half of the bar. Pass a door, turn left, head down a hall way, and bathrooms on the right. The bathrooms are shared between multiple restaurants. The bathrooms were cleaned during my visit - plenty of paper towels to use.",

This place was not my choice but I went along with the group figuring I'd find something on the menu to eat. Ended up with a fabulous Angus burger on ciabatta with tapenade. It was delicious. Fries were fine but the burger stole the show. Not too juicy, just enough. Good bun. Tapenade added to the flavor rather than masking it. This will be a lunch or late bite go-to anytime I'm in the neighborhood. Friends- be shocked but it's True!",

The first time I was alone and got the burger with foie gras and truffle mayo on an onion bun (that part recommended by the bartender). It was totally delicious, perfectly cooked, and the truffle mayo was fantastic. The staff was friendly and the environment appealing, despite that this restaurant is tucked into an otherwise-indifferent strip of shops. The second time my girlfriend and I came here to get their Ultimate Bloody Mary (or whatever they call it here). I have to say, if there was any alcohol in that Bloody Mary, both of us missed it. But the elaborate setup of it-- with a slider, bacon strip, chicken wing, olives, you name it-- was fabulous, and for $19.95 you can't beat it. Not only did it look \"TV show great,\" as my son said later upon seeing the photo, but my girlfriend and I agreed that the chicken wings were the best we'd ever had. We tried to order additional ones because they were so delicious, but at the time we were there, the only available version was a platter for $15, and that's more than we could eat. I'd still like to come back here just for the chicken wings.  Highly recommend this place and will definitely return!",

    "text": "For our group's end of the year dinner, we were angling for burgers and decided on this place mainly because they were likely to be able to seat a table of just shy of twenty. I got more and more excited as I did my research and found that this was often listed as a top burger place in Las Vegas. Hey, don't laugh at my naivete! You know it's all about Bachi anyway if you're a local.  I chose the Hubert Keller burger because I wanted to try buffalo meat and I was too lazy to try to custom-build one. Oh, and the whole having his name on it thing means it has to be good or else, right? Indeed, it was delicious. It came out medium-rare as I had requested, and the first thing I did was try to take a bite without adding the red wine and shallot reduction. Mistake number one! Gotta pour that sauce on there to get the maximum flavor out of this. Granted, the caramelized onions and blue cheese complemented each other well, but you need to use the sauce. Also, I liked the bite from the red onions that I threw on later and barely noticed the lettuce and tomato, which is fine by me because I just didn't want them to go to waste on the plate.  Did I not talk about the meat yet? Well, that's because I was saving it for its own paragraph. I loved it. It was similar to beef in a way, but it had a much cleaner flavor. It's somewhat hard to detect the unique flavor that sets it apart until you get a piece of mostly meat in your mouth, which I finally did at the end, and it's definitely not what I would call gamey or anything. It's just something different to appreciate because you don't eat it everyday (well, I guess you can, but I can't be bothered).  The only drawback to my meal was that the fries somehow just did not go with the burger, so it was like eating two separate dishes the entire time. I think I should've had sweet potato fries instead. When I tried a few of those from my friend, the sweetness called out to me as something that would have worked. So for those of you who might wanna try the Hubert Keller burger, I do suggest that you try to substitute in sweet potato fries for the normal thin fries (but it might cost more? dunno).  There is no doubt that this is a great place on the Strip to have a burger. If you're from out of town (and you're not one of those deprived people who have never tried In-N-Out), you won't go wrong making this your burger stop.",

I ordered the Kobe burger medium rare.. and it was the perfect fit for me. My burger came in nice and juicy. The meat itself was simply seasoned and charbroiled for several minutes.

The burger has quite the options. You choose your buns and can literally add up to dozens of additional ingredients including bacon, avocado, dipping sauce etc. to it. We tried with the sesame and onion buns, both types of dipping sauces (one truffle based and the other red wine based), various cheeses, and finally garlic fries with Aioli dipping. We also tried their Nutella milkshakes. Overall, we were satisfied with the meal, but to be honest, Wagyu beef does not shine in burger form. The dipping sauces were nice but nothing spectacular and adds nothing new to the meal. The garlic fries actually were the best part of the meal. The milkshakes were absolutely DIVINE but obviously for other good reasons. We enjoyed our visit overall but were not sure whether the place was worth the price. Each burger came out just over $40.",

    "text": "Great? no. Decent - a surprising yes.  We needed a place to go with our 3.5 year old; and, well, French Fries are her primary sustenance. The Burger Bar more than adequately met our needs.  A big plus is the fact that they have gluten free buns, fries and beers (I wish they had the best GF beer in the world - Harvester). I didn't expect such a windfall in a place like Las Vegas (sorry - no offense Vegas).   The quality of the food stuffs was also remarkably high. From the choice of meats to the \"make your own burger\" toppings - everything was really well prepared.   My one fault to the place - it has the feel of a Denny's. The overall ambiance is a bit lacking. This is not outside of general expectation - especially as the restaurant is on the LV Strip; but, it would have been nice if the overall decor and ambiance of the Burger Bar were a bit more \"upscale.\"",

GUESTS: 17 people  FOOD: Turkey Burger, added fried egg and pepper jack cheese ($13).  I loved that you were able to build your own burger with many options for add-ons.  This allowed everyone in our group to customize their order.  TASTE: The food was out of this world delicious.  One of the best places to find a delicious burger.  The burger was cooked perfectly and the presentation was on point.  Some members of our group ordered milkshakes which they said were phenomenal.    BEVERAGE: Diet Cherry Pepsi ($3.50)  SERVICE: Waiter was phenomenal.  He continually came back to refill our water glasses and patiently dealt with our loud group.  CLEANLINESS: Restaurant, silverware, glasses, etc. were all clean.  WAIT TIME: We had an evening reservation and were seated almost immediately upon arrival.",

We went mid afternoon so had to trouble be seating almost right away in a booth.  The waitress promptly came to get our drink orders and then the food order.  I decided to get the turkey burger on whole wheat for $8.75 and a side order of onion rings for $3.45.  There are 6 choices of buns to choose from.  The burger came with lettuce, tomato, onions and a pickle and I added a little bit of ketchup.  I found it to be a little on the dry side but not too bad.  The onion rings were delicious and reminded me of the A&W ones.  You got quite a bit in a cylinder container.

We never make reservations and they are always able to seat us right away or within 30 min (which is enough time to check out the nearby shops).    The Burgers are outstanding and the fact that you can pick from so many toppings, buns, cheeses makes this place just AWESOME. I only wish they had pretzel buns (as those are my fav). Fries are soooooo good. YOu have several choices too. I always get sweet potato fries and they are super duper crisp. Zuchinni fries are so good too. I always tend to overeat--its just so good i try to shove it all in.  They also cook it perfectly--as you wish. I like mine medium and I got mine medium. Prices are reasonable for a customized burger.  My only complaint is the service. Not sure why, but its a lil' slow. It's not like we are rushing to get outta there, but when you're hungry its a LONG time to wait for your food.  Waiters good be a tid bit friendlier.

It never gets old because there are so many combinations.  My favorite meat was bison.  Mmm!  They also have a a full bar with a nice selection of beers.

In fact, many Yelpers I respect and normally agree with love this place but man, I haven't felt this ripped off since I bought my HDDVD player.   Maybe Im biased against these so-called \"gourmet burger\" spots.  I mean, what makes a hamburger great is that its approachable by everyone, regardless of economics.  Perhaps thats why it has come to be synonymous with America...that it crosses boundaries.   Not here however, these burgers are decidedly expensive and in reality no better than anything you'd find at your favorite local burger joint.    Just because you use the word \"kobe\" or \"danish blue cheese\" doesn't mean you have the right to charge $20 bucks for a burger...but apparently here it does.  Another thing is one would think a gourmet burger place would have gourmet fries right?  Wrong...here the fries were so mediocre I was yearning for Chili's.......yep, thats right I said Chili's and now I must shower to wash the shame off my body.    I had Hubert's favorite burger which was composed of Buffalo, Bleu Cheese and sherry shallot reduction sauce.  It tasted ok, but the price...oh that price!  Would you spend 15 bucks for a gourmet hot dog?  You would tell me to jump off a bridge!  My mom had the sliders and reported them as being ok as well, but nothing special.  Service was average but not very friendly.  I mean I would have a smile if I was getting a 10 dollar tip for bringing out two hamburgers and a couple soda pops but who am I to judge?  One positive thing to note was Burger Bar did have a nice beer selection with some unique options at decent prices.  Its nice to be free from the normal yoke of beer oppression perpetrated by the casinos.  I for one can pass on this place again but judging by the crowd there and the reviews on Yelp, most people disagree.....Twilight Zone I tells ya!!!!",

No really, I could go on and on about the trashy crowds, the trash, the smoky casinos (not my scene!), etc. but at least a good find was to be had in terms of a quick, casual dinner on our one-night stopover. Not taken with the idea of eating at one of Las Vegas' famous, extravagant buffets, we decided to wander around the Mandalay Place shopping mall behind Mandalay Bay to see what we could find. Burger Bar was far-and-away the least crowded and most casual looking, so there we went.   The menu offers your average burger assortment including some interesting toppings, and a solid cocktail list. I went for a dry martini (I needed it) and my friend had a boozy milkshake which she enjoyed. Our burgers were prepared quickly and everything seemed fresh and on-point. The toppings were flavorful (I had caramelized onions and gruyere cheese), and service was prompt and friendly. Burger Bar really was terrific and a great find for a quick meal.",

You'll be better served (both taste and service wise) at other joints in town like Bachi Burger, Holstein's and other establishments. Their Drunken Monkey and Mint Chocolate chip spiked shakes are also a colossal disappointment lacking any distinct flavors and instead tasting like something that would be served at Johnny Rockets or Red Robin. The Hubert (Helen) Keller burger has a beefy flavor further bolstered by use of spinach and Bleu cheese. However, you could get a similar tasting burger for $5 at Joe's Junior in the East Village at New York City. The Reuben on the other hand lacks any punch and the corned beef overtakes the burger in the dish. The fact that the sauerkraut fails to pull through in the composition nor does it even taste much like anything when eaten alone would explain the fact that the parts of the burger cannot even hope to become much of a sum.

After being told there was a 30-minute wait for 2 people, I went next door to Hussong's and was immediately sat with water and chips on the table in under two minutes. I'm going to go write a review on Hussong's after this margarita!",

We had a really great server..who was also not bad to look at. He made sure our waters were filled and when the burgers arrived he got us our mayo stat. My burger had American cheese and bacon with the works. I ordered it med rare and it was perfect! I cant never get my grilled burgers at home to look like that. The onion rings went very well with it all. My friend had the same burger but got zucchini as her side. I was able to nibble a few of those. They were good but a touch on the greasy side. All and all a very good spot for a burger!",

Salmon portion seemed to be a bit thicker than usual but it was cooked perfectly.  It is one of the best cuts of salmon I have had at any restaurant.  Sweet potato fries were crispy and also some of the better ones I have had.  Lunch with 2 beers was less than $20 - great value.  By the way, sit at the bar if you can.  It often makes for interesting conversation.",

This place gives you an option to build your own burger or choose from 5 or 6 of their own creations. You start with the meat. You have options of buffalo, turkey, American kobe, or regular grass fed ground beef. This is where the fun starts...... After you choose your meat you then choose how you would like to top it. You can go as plain as American cheese and bacon, or you can fancy it up with foie gra, a lobster tail, and slices of truffles. Anyway you mix and match it, they know how to cook your meat to perfection.  Be careful of not \"over-topping\" your burger as you'll find it difficult to wrap your mouth around it.",

I think it maybe that I just don't like the greasyness of kobe, and it tastes a little gamey (to me ...).  The place was okay, but just okay, and not a bad choice for a quick bite (if they don't have a crowd - but a crowd doesn't always mean good - have you been to Chipoltle lately?... shudder), the sweet potato fries are not as good as you think they will be, service is slow.  Menu is good, lots of interesting choices - but it would be a place I would go to because I was at Mandalay Bay doing something else, not that I would go to Mandalay Bay to go there.",

Love the sweet potato fries and fried zucchini.  The beer selection is of excellent quality also.    It can be crowded and hard to get in at times.   However, note that if you are looking for seats at the bar, the bar extends further back than the portion you can easily see from the entrance.    I wouldn't recommend bothering with their specialty cocktails: the ones I've tried have been rather weak and unremarkable, thus exorbitantly priced at around $12.  I like to have some exotic drinks while in Vegas, so they would get five stars if they shore this up.",

Burger Bar emphasizes beer (large selection) more than wines (not the greatest list of reds).  My husband tried the Rossini burger on a previous visit.  While he completely enjoyed it, I wasn't terribly impressed with the flavor combinations when I had a taste--mostly, the Madeira sauce just seemed a little too sweet that day and didn't seem to work very well with the other items on the burger.  My husband also had the dessert burger--again, while he loved it, I thought it much too strange.

    "text": "Located in Mandalay Bay, on the 2nd floor, Burger bar is a burger joint that has some cool offerings! I had been here about a year ago and tried their veggie burger. It sounds amazing. The description sounds like it was made specifically for me. However, the execution of the burger falls seriously short. It's way way WAAAAY to mushy. Ew. Not at all how a burger should be. I didn't care for it so I didn't order it when I came yesterday. Yesterday, I ordered the salmon burger and zucchini fries. That \"burger\" my friends, was delicious. The only \"complaint\" I have, is they should have put a condiment on it. Either mayo, or some cool dill dip kinda sauce, that would have sooooooooo made it better. We were given so ranch dressing (or that!) for the fries, so I did put some on it. The zucchini fries were OK. They had some weird after taste that I think was a dried spice in the batter. Whatever it was, I didn't care for it. If they took that out, this would be 4 stars, all day long! Now that I think about it, they have all these cool condiments you can add to your burger and sauces you can order for your fries. I should have read them and maybe got one for my burger. Now that I know it doesnt come with anything, I'll order one next time. Price for a salmon burger, in Mandalay Bay, REASONABLE! Only $10.25....NOT bad at all! I was shocked it was so \"cheap\". Nothing on the strip is cheap, unless you find happy hour specials. I was definitely impressed with the burger itself and the place. Service was great. Waitress was always checking on us and refilling our waters. I definitely think I'll come back next time I'm in Mandalay Bay.",

On thing that worked out brilliant was ordering a portobello on top. They are so tasty and meaty that I took that with some of the other ingredients (avo and bacon) and made a second burger out of it. Highly recommend it!  Good sweet potato fries. Good beer selection.  Highly suggest the dessert burger!  Overall: Good place for a meal in Vegas that isn't too pricey and will satisfy most people....who doesn't like a burger?  Value: Alright...with beer it ended up being a pretty pricy meal for burger joint. classy or not.  Quick Tips: - Get the dessert burger (donut/cream cheese, raspberry sauce etc) - Sweet Potato fries - Don't order a bunch of ingredients unless you order the port shroom and then its like two burgers in one.",

This place was packed, but we didn't have too long a wait on a weeknight. I got a burger with blue cheese. Can't remember what hubby had but we both enjoyed our burgers. The onion rings were nothing special at all, sadly. The fries were good though. For dessert, we had the mint chocolate chip sundae, with creme de menthe. There was a huge puddle of the booze right in the middle of it, buried under a mountain of whipped cream. :-) Yeah, it was good.   The place was really loud so not great for conversation. We were tempted by the kobe beef, but just got regular beef and it was still pretty tasty. Overall, it was good but frankly I was expecting more from it.",

If you want to splurge they have a $60 burger made from Kobe Wagyu beef and foie grais with shaved truffles. Sounds amazing but it would take a lot for me to pay $60 for a burger.   Wife and I had the beef, which was good. Then we ordered the sauce sampler. Mind you this a Hubert Keller restaurant so you know it's going to be good. There were 5 sauces that were all amazing. They are great for the burgers as well as a dip for fries.   What really topped off the meal was the buttermilk onion rings. They were flavorful and delicious. They worked well with all the sauces plus the housemade ranch.   Go and enjoy!!!",

How do you know Burger Bar is legit? Here's how... Me: Peppercorn burger Waiter: How'd you like that cooked? Me: Medium Rare Waiter: It might still be bloody is that ok? Me: OMG YES! (rolling eyes in anticipation of amazing nom nom nomness)  The peppercorn aspect of the peppercorn burger actually sucked.  Not enough peppercorn flavor at all, I was expecting an all enveloping thick & crunchy crust of peppercorns.  All I got was a light sprinkling. The peppercorn sauce on the side didn't help.  Don't get me wrong, still a fantastic overall burger but lacking the essential flavor I wanted.  The sliders are great great.  Meat is very flavorful and juicy but you might still be hungry afterward. 3 sliders doesn't necessarily fill up a growing boy.  As for the fries, sweat potato fries are good.  The regular fries on the other hand were great.  They look like Burger King's fries, but are fantastic, thin, crispy, crunchy all the way through (not greasy at all).  I am a fan!  PS. They have an extensive beer list.  Get lost in it, try something new, try something different.",

There was an excellent selection of craft beers I had trouble deciding but ultimately went with the Sin City lager which was smooth & tasty.  The waitress was very attentive and made sure we had everything we needed.

The sweet potato fries are the best I have ever had- a lot of places do not know, or care, to make a great sweet potato fry. I got the Nutella milkshake and it was soooo good! Not only that but I have dreams of their burger desserts: the first one is a Nutella patty on a donut bun with passion fruit gelatin, kiwi and strawberries- the second is a donut bun with a cheesecake custard and pineapple slice (it tastes like an pineapple upside down cake).  It can get VERY pricey if you don't watch what you are doing. You can build your own burger and shake if you want, but BEWARE- it will be more expensive to do so than if you go with their featured foods.  Example: the Nutella milkshake was 7.00 (all milkshakes are, but for the Salted Caramel which is 8.75), if I wanted to make my own the ice cream to start with is listed as 7.00. Syrups and toppings range from 30 cents to 1 dollar. Add whip cream? 1 more dollar. Liquor? WAAAAY more than a dollar. So, unless you feel like raking out nearly twenty bucks, go with one of their featured shakes.",

Though skeptical, I have to say I was intrigued by the prospects of a good milkshake and a burger. Little did I know that not only were these milkshakes everything he had built them up to be but the burgers were incredible as well. Good texture, perfectly cooked and highly recommend a side of sweet potato fries - which are also amazing. And you'd be doing yourself a huge disservice by just doing the burger without the milkshake. The Black White Milkshake may well be he world's perfect dessert. Chocolate mousse whipped cream with chocolate chips and fudge swimming in vanilla ice cream? Are you kidding me? We went back the night before I left just so I could have another for the road!

Not once did I question bypassing the Kobe beef or buffalo burgers, tempting as they may be.  Amazingly juicy at a perfectly cooked medium, with mushrooms, peppers and caramelized onions on top, I'm not sure I've had a better burger.  Their housemade dijon was also a delicious addition.  The fries (tried both fat and sweet potato) were good and very reasonably priced but not exactly must-haves.  I also got dessert, sharing both a nutella milkshake and the raspberry float.  The nutella milkshake is a chocolate lover's dream, and luckily I am one.  Chocolate chips, chocolate syrup, chocolate ice cream, chocolate whipped cream and nutella.. yep it's as good as it sounds.  At $9, it's also a bit pricey, but hey, you might as well go all out when you're already spending close to $20 for a burger and fries.  The raspberry float was tasty too, even though I don't usually like fruity things.  All-in-all, an amazing burger place.  Definitely give it a shot if you're in the area.",

My 2nd attempt burger came back in the same raw and mushy condition so I asked for it to be removed from the bill.

I ordered what the chef recomended so it had provolone and sat on top of a Onion bun because I didn't want anything to take away from the over $20.00 Kobe hamburger patty.  It  was nothing to Yelp about.  If I would of known it was gonna taste like that I would of ordered everything on it , cause it just was not what I was expecting.

    "text": "I am sure you are all familiar with the traditional salad-bar concept. You walk up to a selection of ingredients and fix yourself a personalized salad. Burger Bar takes that idea and steals it on behalf of carnivores everywhere (but primarily in Las Vegas!). There is no need for a sneeze guard at Burger Bar since all of the available ingredients, or burger toppings if you will, are listed on the menu. They do offer pre-designed burgers that range from reasonable to not-so-reasonable price-wise, but the fun as far as I am concerned is in building my own burger.   For eaters more adventurous than I, which basically means everyone, Burger Bar is one of the few places in Las Vegas where I would suggest you go to frequently. With so many restaurants in Las Vegas it is hard to go someplace you have been before at the expense of trying somewhere new, but I try to apply that concept to dinner more than I do for lunch. Burger Bar, though a fantastic dinner spot, works well for lunch too. Each time you go, you can create a new burger blueprint like one you have never had before. There are enough options to keep you entertained visit after visit. And even though I basically get the same thing everytime, it hasn't gotten old yet.   Angus Beef + Sesame seed roll + Bacon + Cheddar cheese + Fried egg = Bliss. Add their Brown gravy and you'll wonder why anyone puts ketchup on a burger (and it's GREAT on their skinny fries).   When, not if, you go looking for Burger Bar, you'll find it in Mandalay Bay in the Mandalay Place.",

Get a booth if you can, they come with a mini tv showing sports. There is a always a great atmosphere here and the staff are really friendly. Its gets quite busy at dinner time, but you can put your name down for a table and go sit at the bar for a drink.

The staff was very friendly and our waitress/bartender made me one of her special martini's with coffee beans in it to wake me up. She also gave me a souvenir bottle of water with a devil on it (very fitting haha). My turkey burger was cooked perfectly. I was very impressed with this place even though its just a burger bar.",

    "text": "I'd really want to give this place a 4 star rating... but I think it only deserves a 3 star.  Located in the indoor walkway/mall halfway between Mandalay Bay and Luxor (closer to Mandalay), I've been to Burger Bar twice in Vegas.  The first time I had seen the place featured on a travel show and thought the idea was pretty cool.  You basically get to pick from a huge list of options to create your perfect hamburger -- everything from different meats, toppings, breads, and extras.  If you want a Kobe beef burger topped with lobster tail, yes you can get it here.  If you want a turkey burger with avocado, they've got it too.  So they've got the quantity, but I really think they lack in quality.  Don't get me wrong - the burger tastes good.  And damnit, if you don't like one of the toppings, it is kind of your fault for picking that.  But really, when it comes down to it, the burger just isn't amazing or spectacular like I'd expect from a Vegas burger joint.  The sides aren't anything to write home about either.  Their prices can quickly add up too since each topping comes with an additional charge.  So in the end, Burger Bar gets a 3-star rating.  One bonus: they have a solid selection of microbrews.",

After a late night of partying on the Strip, Burger Bar is the best place to stop in and sober up (open until 1 AM on Friday and Saturdays).  If you're coming for a regular meal, you can't go wrong with the American Classic burger, with cheese, bacon, onions and tomato.  But if you just want a quick bite, go for the sliders.  You get 3 different burgers:  two of them with different types of beef, the other with buffalo meat.    But to make your meal really special, get a milkshake.  Each time I come here, I get the Nutella milkshake, which is the best milkshake I've ever had.  For some reason, the milkshakes are better here, even better than the SF Burger Bar.

The burger was superb and the side of fries were decent and my plate cost around $14 which is to be expected at a joint right on the strip. The waitstaff was friendly and attentive as they could be while the place was pretty full. All in all, not a bad pit-stop after a concert at The House of Blues or perhaps a long night of shopping.  Their dessert options looked quite intriguing however I have not yet gotten a chance to order off of that menu.",

Frankly, Hubert Keller should be ashamed to serve such swill.\" (2) sticky seats, slow service at the bar (2) value: skip this joint and head to Five Guys or In and Out - way better in terms of quality, cleanliness and value. (2)  We went here for happy hour on a weekday and it was as boisterous and loud as if it were a weekend. This place is pretty hopping and there were a crowd of people waiting to be seated.  Luckily, we only wanted to try the happy hour so we were able to walk through and find a small space at the end of the bar to settle ourselves in. Another gentleman told us - \"just grab a chair... that's what I did\". So we did precisely that. Unfortunately, the seat that I stole was inherently sticky from some unknown substance which kind of increased the \"ew\" factor. In addition to this, it took a long while to get menus or heck! even get anyone to acknowledge our presence.  We ordered their buffalo wings, chicken strips, plate of 3 sliders and their wedge salad.  Their buffalo wings had a nice texture however it was nothing special to me. The seasoning of the wings was a standard hot sauce just like what you can get anywhere else. The dressing it was served with lack any sort of distinctive flavor - if you can't tell if it's ranch or blue cheese that's pretty freaking bad.   The chicken strips had a heavy slightly salty breading that tasted like what you'd get at any average cafeteria. Same goes for the fries.  The wedge salad was kind of disappointment because the tomatoes were on the mealy side. Yuck!  Finally their sliders. It was rather unfortunate that their meat is inadequately seasoned which ruined it all for me.  All in all, the food here is edible but hardly more than that. Given Hubert Keller's reputation, it should be way better than this. Factor in the cost...this place is a 2 star in my book.",

The food and the service both seemed so so, and for the price, so so doesn't cut it.   This time I tried the $17.95 Buffalo burger, which worked out to be $22.15 with a slice of cheese and a side of unremarkable fries.  When the plates hit the table, the fries we piping hot (two hot to eat), but the burger was just lukewarm and relatively flavorless.  My suspicion is the cook let the burger sit waiting for the fries he waited too long to drop to finish cooking.    When the waitress asked me how everything was, I told her \"It's alright.\"  What a mistake that turned out to be.  I should have just smiled politely and said \"great.\"  When she offered to get me another burger or whatever, I told her I didn't want to make a fuss or get something else.  She didn't listen.  Before I know it, the manager is standing over me explaining how they prepare the vaunted buffalo burger, how they sell about 800 regular hamburgers a day compared to only 20 buffalo burgers and take extra care preparing the buffalo burger, and how customer satisfaction is very important to him and to the server.  Bud, I know a lukewarm, relatively flavorless burger when I taste one, and I call this faux \"service.\"  The visit by the manager was an unwanted intrusion upon a meal that was already disappointing.",

It felt like I was hunting for worms in a lettuce patch. Never again. I left at least 60% of the salad for the garbage.  Bloody marys ($12) are a 5-star affair, if you're looking for a drink while you're there. Good tomato-to-spiciness ratio, and comes with cheese-stuffed olives. Yum!

When we got there me and my bf had already perused the menu all week deciding what we wanted to order so I was thrilled that the food lived up to my stupidly high expectations.   I ordered the burger sliders as an attempt to test my taste buds to see if I could tell the difference between the different kinds of meat. Long story short...I couldnt. But it was still nice to get a variety of toppings on each one so that you dont get bored. The best thing though for me was stealing some of my bfs truffle mayo (which like all the condiments/sauces comes on the side) and putting it on each of my sliders. It was sooooo goood. Now im a sucker for anything with truffle so thumbs up for that. One thing they should do is let you order some of their toppings even if you are not making your own burger. Next time I think id want to try the truffle sauce.   Bfs burger was kobe with foie grais and some other stuff. He said he couldnt really taste the quality of the kobe either. The kicker was the foie grais which they give a generous amount of. Next time he said he would just order the angus meat as long as he had the foie grais.   Even as we were leaving and throughout that weekend I could not stop thinking about those little burgerw with truffle mayo. Burger bar I will be back!",

    "text": "Burger Bar had decent burgers, so I would have given it 3 stars, but for their extremely slow service, I could only give two. We were a table of 2 around late 1 PM, almost 2 PM on a weekend, and there weren't enough customers to justify the 40 minute wait time for food. We only ordered a burger each.   The burgers were large portioned, and tasted decent but not amazing enough for its high price. We customized our burgers, and I liked the variety of choices on their menu. The beef was tender and cooked very well to our liking. However, we both found the meat to be extremely bland, as if they had forgotten to season it. What saved the burger was the sauce that was paired with it, otherwise it would have been too bland to enjoy.   I hadn't tried any other burger joints on the strip, but Burger Bar certainly isn't any better than burger joints in LA. I can find gourmet burgers in LA that taste better, without the hefty price tag.",

    "text": "OVERRATED.  Can I just leave the review with that one word?  We visited Burger Bar because it was in the concourse that connected our hotel to the Luxor, so it was convenient.  A friend of mine also spoke very highly of their food, so off we went.  The menu is much like Kuma's, but the quality of the food is much lower.  Maybe I've been spoiled here in Chicago, but we have a LOT of good burgers and burger restaurants.  Especially ones that make 'signature' or 'specialty' burgers.  That said, nothing at Burger Bar was particularly interesting or novel to me.  The food was good, don't get me wrong.  It's not like everything tasted gross.  I just think that the reputation of this place is more a myth since this place is just a burger restaurant.    The food is (duh) overpriced since this is inside a Vegas casino mall.  The drinks were decent and apparently the booze shakes were excellent.  Order one of those and tell me what you think.    I'd rather enjoy the buffet at my hotel next time since it's cheaper and offers a larger selection of various foods.  Meh.",

After a disappointing trip to the San Francisco location, we were torn whether or not to come back, but we're glad we did. The Red Velvet alcoholic shake was terrific. It tasted just like a red velvet cupcake (complete with frosting) and it wasn't overpowered by the alcohol. I ordered the kobe burger with seared foie gras and the truffle perigord sauce. The extras are a little pricey but it was quite tasty and enjoyable. They have great dipping sauces for the fries as well, and I'd recommend the white barbecue, which is sweet, and the truffle aioli which combines the traditional garlic aioli with an unmistakable hint of truffle. Great food, decent and prompt service. Can't wait to go back!",

I've become a bit of a craft beer enthusiast recently. I still don't know what I'm talking about, but I do enjoy a good brew. I noticed Ken M included Burger Bar on his \"Craft Beer Revolution\" list. I never would have thought of Burger Bar for that. I just pictured it as a place for expensive burgers. That's changed of course.  On my two recent visits, I ordered a Salmon Steak sandwich with some sprouts. At $8.50 (plus I think 55c for the sprouts), it's one of the cheapest things on the menu but I find it absolutely delicious. I get the salmon cooked medium and it comes out perfectly.  On the beer front, I went with the Deschutes Inversion IPA on my first visit and the Burger Bar Seasonal on my second. I'm a big fan of Deschutes anything. The Burger Bar Seasonal is currently a Hefeweizen by Tenaya Creek Brewery. Being a local brewery, I had to give it a try. I really need to make my way up to Tenaya Creek one of these days.  Burger Bar has kind of fallen off my scope in recent years. Now that I know I can get a good salmon sandwich with a great beer to go with it, it's back on my radar.",

I'm sure this might be hit or miss, but at least this experience has repeated itself.  The concept of the build your burger and of course the Hubert endorsement is a reason that fills the seat, but my love for the Burger Bar unfortunately stops there.  I have gone on 3 separate occasions and the first 2 I have had issues with the burger and recently it was now my wife who had the \"Irish Luck\" with Lunch.  The first two times I had the build your burger and both times they had come out raw vs. the medium that was requested. I normally am not a complainer when I eat, but for something like that getting sick is not my forte.  Recently I went and this time it was my wife's burger that was red and dripping blood which was inexcusable. She ordered sliders and she even said it best \"how can you undercook a small patty\"?  Beyond those experiences, I feel the overall flavor of the burger itself is just not there. I was looking for a little kick or at least something that doesn't leave me looking for a soda or a \"dolled up\" milk shake. I'm now on the hunt for a new burger establishment to satisfy my requests.",

We also ordered fries with dipping sauces (also each item an additional charge). The restaurant was nearly empty, but it took over 40 minutes for our meal to arrive.

I got the Rossini, which featured wagyu beef, seared fois gras, shaved truffles, all served with a black Perigord truffle sauce. I must say the beef was perfectly medium rare, as requested. The fois gras was a thick slab that was not nicely spread out over the burger. The sauce was tasty but was too salty. The bun was completely forgettable. Overall, NOT worth the $60 price tag. The flavors were rich but weren't well-balanced. A few more well-chosen ingredients to round out the burger would've made a huge difference.   The beer float paddle was innovative and worth the one-time experiment. Only two of them worked very well, though, which included raspberry-flavored ciders -- maybe because my palate expected something sweet. The bitterness of a lager mixed with strawberries and whipped cream was undrinkable, despite how tasty the whipped cream was. And although Guiness and coffee ice cream go well in theory, I'd say empirically the two are each SO good on their own, it's a disservice to combine them.   Ambiance is non-existent. At the comfy booths, there are TV screens about the size of a square foot flashing some sports highlights and a ton of ads throughout the entire evening. It is completely distracting, seeming to promote ADHD over any meaningful human interaction. What's worse, there is no way to turn the screens off. (If you have low tolerance for this, use two knives to wedge one of the black napkins over the damn thing and try to enjoy your meal.)",

The sweet potato fries are a must as well.  I'm a self deemed foodie so I'm all about customization.  I know you are never supposed to mess with a good thing (as the majority of menus TELL you what you will be ingesting), but I enjoy Chef's approach where you choose your protein, bun and toppings.  Sometimes I'm not always in the mood for the INSERT NUMBER here, so this type of menu opens you up for multiple visits.    During the last visit I had to go with the Angus (mid-rare) on Ciabatta (for the crunch) topped w/ Blue Cheese (addict), Avocado and Carmelized Onions w/ a side of Sweet Potato fries.   Burger came out in about 15 minutes and it was gone in less than 5.  The crunch of the bread w/ the combination of the buttery avocado, saltiness of the blue and sweetness of the onions made me have instant happy face.  Very satisfying meal and we will be back next time I swing by Mandalay.  Next time, i'll have to try the Milkshakes as I saw these being served to the Mid-Westerners at the table next to me who were raving that they were \"GONNA DIE\" because they were so good.",

For appetizers we had the alcoholic mint chocolate chip shake and the macaroni and cheese croquettes. I enjoyed both but the alcoholic shake needed a bit more liquor, however the croquettes were amazing!   I chose the classic burger with Angus beef and skinny fries and also sampled some of my boo's salmon burger. I ordered my burger medium-well which I think was a mistake because it was a bit on the dry side. (I think it would've been perfect had I ordered it medium.) However, the salmon burger which was also ordered medium well was perfect and still very moist. (Note: the salmon burger does not come with a side.)   The staff was overall very nice in the ambience was great. I think this is a trendy spot, not really a \"locals\" hang out. I think this place is fun and I wouldn't mind going back but it's not an everyday experience because the food is quite pricey.",

Burger Bar has established itself over the past years as a standard in higher end gourmet burgers.  The menu here has some nice selections and variety for most who enjoy a great burger, healthy and not so healthy options are available.   When approaching with a group make sure to grab a reservation. Most nights of the week can be busy as Mandalay Bay and Luxor are generally busy but when a convention is on it can be packed.   My recommendation is the Spicy Lamb Burger. As lamb can be little hard to find in town, Burger Bar seems to get it right. Most the burgers will come with fries, but are able to changed out for salad if need be.  One also great aspect of Burger Bar that isn't really talked about is the Beer Menu. They carry a fair amount of local and nationally crafted beers that is rotated out month.  Overall Service: 4-5 Food: 4-5 Cleanliness: 3-5 Coming back: yes",

It's tempting to pass up since there are so many great restaurants in the hotel alone, but people in the group were up for burgers and it was a good option after several business meals.  The drinks were good. I didn't go Kobe (someday, someday), but the burger and steak fries are more than enough for me. I went purist here. Even the vegetarian in the group seemed satisfied. Which says a lot for a burger bar.",

We all got Kobe burgers either onion rings, skinny fries, fried zucchini and multiple milk shakes alcoholic and regular.   Burgers are fine big enough to split but you have to buy toppings which is kinda annoying. Without toppings the burgers Would be bland.  Skinny fries okay? Always love onion rings,fried zuchinni was good to. Perfect amount of friedness( is that a word?)  Milk shakes were amazing, both types and even if u want to customize it further they were okay with it.   Only con was food took long time to come out",

    "text": "Maybe my expectations were too built-up.  But I have to say:  Burger Bar was alright in a few aspects but generally, kind of a let-down.  Like any typical eatery on the Strip, they really stick it to you on drink prices.  Learn from my experience:  get the Burger Bar-tender to make your cocktail without so much ice.  Still, the Bloody Mary was delicious, served with a really crunchy full-size celery stalk.  Beer on tap was alright.  Strawberry Breeze, on the other hand, was weak and only so-so in flavour.  And further made worse, with a truly pathetic looking frost-bitten strawberry on the rim.  Trust me, this drink would *never* have passed muster, had the Executive Chef/Owner even glanced at it before it left the bar for the customer.  Really left a bad impression-- just that one detail.  Burger Bar's servers were competent and cheery.  The hosts at front were less engaging, and very distracted.  If you want to have a meal at the bar, no problem no wait... just go straight in.  However, securing a table requires more patience than it should.  The booths were nice and comfortable.  Food-wise, it was... good.  But I can't say extremely satisfying.  Portions are not generous.  And way over-priced drinks leave a bad taste in one's mouth.  The lamb burger was thick, juicy, cooked exactly as ordered.  Tasty enough.  The condiment, though-- some kind of diced red pepper salsa mixture that came with-- was the real star of the dish.  That brought out the best in the lamb patty.  Burger Bar's Sliders were a trio of different beef varieties, done to medium just as requested.  Tasted fine, very good meat quality.  Buttermilk zucchini sticks and Skinny fries were crispy, light and nice too.  This is a costly burger joint.  I kind of want more value for above average food.  Going to have to do better than this, Chef Hubert, to get me to return.  Signed,  Slightly Bummed Out by the Burger Bar",

An hour fifteen minutes later we we're finally seated. Sitting at our table we were given our menus but never introduced to our server. Twenty minutes passed as we were passed about eight times by various servers, but never acknowledged.  Luckily, one person in our party called the hostess desk and told them we did not have a server. Within minutes, the manager came by apologizing and finally giving us a waitress. We were even offered a free round of drinks. The dissatisfaction in my face and stomach was not repairable.  Food was ordered and still wasn't happy. I blame the service solely on the manager. If the manager was on top of the staff this would never happen. The apology of miscommunication is inexcuseable. If the table is assigned to you, you should attend to your table. Burger bar, you got my money today but never again. No matter what city, country, or planet you are established in!",

This place is located in Mandalay Place which is the shopping walkway in  between Luxor and Mandalay Bay. The prices are definitely steep, you start at $8.95 for a regular burger but then your add ons like cheese, mushrooms, etc, cost that extra cash. Fries and sides are extra too, by the time you're done you paid a pretty penny for burgers and fries. I recommend the sweet potato fries.  Service did not check on us once after the food arrived, maybe he knew we were trying to be cheap cause we split a burger and he didn't bother??? HAH probably.  edit***   Went to Gordon Biersch and ordered a burger, I swear it was just as good, and probably cheaper.",

    "text": "On our trip to Vegas a couple months ago, we stayed at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay.  Saturday evening, not feeling like going out into the hot desert air for food, we decided to stay at Mandalay Bay and look for some good, reasonably priced eats.  Yeah, I know, reasonably priced eats at Mandalay Bay, good luck, huh?  Well, we didn't find them.  We saw Burger Bar in the restaurant list in our room and decided to check it out.  Upon arriving, we looked at the menu outside the place and it was a little bit more than we wanted to spend on a late dinner.  We left and walked around the shopping area and by the restaurants inside the casino area and confirmed what we already knew, no cheap eats at Mandalay.  With no better ideas, we went back to Burger Bar.   It was pretty busy, and there was a wait for a table, so we decided to sit at the bar where there was no wait.     Burger bar has a pretty wide variety of meats, cheeses, bread and toppings for you to build your own burger.  They have a veggie burger, turkey, lamb, Angus beef, Ridgefield Farm beef and Kobe beef.  Once you choose your meat and bread, you can add cheese and other toppings as you like (but of course, each topping costs extra).  They have the usual topping like bacon, mushrooms, onions, chili and peppers.  If you're feeling adventurous (and have some money to burn) you can get some of the more exotic toppings like shrimp ($6.00), lobster ($12.00), foie gras ($12.00) or black truffles (1/3 oz for $30.00).  To go along with your burger, they have fat fries, skinny fries, sweet potato fries, zucchini fries or onion rings.  Finally, if you don't feel like a burger, they have a marinated chicken breast, a salmon steak or a few different salads.   After waivering between the Angus beef burger and the Kobe beef burger, I decided what the hell, I'm in Vegas, I'll go for the Kobe beef.  I decided on mozarella cheese, fried egg, mushrooms and jalapeno bacon for my toppings and a side of fat fries to go along with it.  Should have been a five star burger, but it wasn't.  I would have been way happier with a Fatburger for 1/3 of the price.  I haven't had a lot of Kobe beef, and I had high expectations for it, but it seriously let me down.  It tasted like angus beef, nothing special.  I asked for it medium and it was overcooked too.  Kind of crunchy on the outside.  The toppings were good, but again, nothing better than what I could have gotten at Fatburger.  The fries were good, but that isn't tough to do fries right.     Overall, a disappointing over-priced burger.  Four stars for the selection, but minus two for the taste and price.  The only reason I would come back here next time I'm at Mandalay Bay would be to get a milkshake to go.  Sitting at the bar, we were right in front of where the servers made the milkshakes.  Whole milk, real ice cream and Hershey's chocolate syrup, the perfect chocolate milkshake!!  They also have vanilla, peanut butter, strawberry, and banana.  Mmmm...chocolate banana peanut butter milkshake...drool.  I sorely regret not getting one.  It was, however, enjoyable to watch the cute waitress make them.  Darnit, now I have the Milkshake Song in my head...",

I don't even LIKE burgers!\" so then I never ended up going back... until now.  My boyfriend is the reason I decided to mention Burger Bar this past weekend, because I know HE loves burgers and I told him \"babe, since YOU love burgers, let me take you to this cool place I know!\" He didn't even really want to try it out at first because who would trust ME as as burger critic?? I got the veggie burger the first visit for Christ sake!  But let me just tell you, that just validates my point even more. This place has something for everyone. They have salads, veggie burgers, no-carb burgers, vegan burgers, salmon burgers, chicken burgers, turkey burgers, angus burgers, kobe burgers, anything you can think of, they'll put in between their delicious burger buns (the bread is oh-so-good!) and voila -- the best burger experience in my life, hands down!",

    "text": "Well, I guess I'll be the first to give a not-so-great review.   I so love Hubert Keller from all the cooking shows (and actually, I rode in an elevator at Mandalay with him- but couldn't get the nerve up to say anything! DOH!). I had high expectations, and felt so let down.  We sat at the bar, as the booths and tables were all full. The service was friendly. We ordered the strawberry mojitos to start. They were not good. They tasted like cherry 7-UP and the strawberries were so big they clogged the straw- so you couldn't get a sip without scooting your straw around and trying to dislodge the strawberry.   We ordered the mix of 3 fried things and 5 sauces to share, and I ordered the veggie burger. I found it a bit daunting to choose from all the little extras for the burger. I did try a couple, and, in the end, my veggie burger ended up costing around 15 bucks (with no fries...those we had to pay extra for).  We chose the mozz sticks, sweet potato fries, and regular french fries for our combo. For sauces, we chose the spicy ketchup, the tartar sauce, the cinnamon sauce, the chipotle aioli....and I can't remember the other one. They weren't horrible, but none of them were special. Again, it's Hubert Keller's restaurant, so I figured the sauces would be sublime. The fries were also so disappointing! Just basic, frozen fries. The sweet potato fries were great with the cinnamon sauce, and I usually don't care for sweet anything. They were the highlight.  My veggie burger sucked. For one, it was huge. Hotel rooms in Vegas typically don't have microwaves, so there is no way to reheat left-overs. I don't understand why Vegas restaurants serve such ridiculous portions when you cannot enjoy left-overs! More than half of my veggie burger was thrown away.  The burger was also mushy and tasteless. I ordered some of the cool sounding add-ons, but couldn't taste them at all. The beet relish came in a little ramekin and had no flavor whatsoever.   My sister and her friend liked their meat burgers, so maybe it's just the veggie burger. If I ever try the place again, I'll try the vegan sandwich (with the roasted veggies) on ciabatta.",

This is located in Mandalay Bay inside the shopping mall strip side.  We went for lunch or right before noon and we were lucky to get a seat right away.  I noticed as we were leaving the line started getting long to get seated.  Very juicy burgers.....there are plenty of selections to choose from.  I think there even was an option for chicken and salmon.  I opted for making my own burger with toppings I wanted and it was one of the best burgers I have tasted and I'm not a big burger fan.

Located in between Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, this joint has a plethora of add ons and options for you to create your own masterpiece. Much like El Guapo had presents in Three Amigos!   My choice of late has been a simple Ridgefield beef(don't splurge on the Kobe or anything special) with Swiss, caramelized onions, portabello and the red wine and shallot reduction. Which, we found out the reduction has veal in it, so it is not vegetarian, much to Dallas G's consternation. Don't get the burger cooked anymore than medium. It comes out perfect this way. Their sweet potato fries are really good too. They have a great beer selection as well. Dessert options are many, but I have been to full to try any of them. I have had the Peanut Butter shake, which is to die for. You can go a little over board on the price of your burger depending on the add ons and the amount you get. This is a staple on any of our Vegas trips. In fact, I don't think there has been one where we have not gone.",

    "text": "If you see someone who reviewed Burger Bar and they didn't give it five stars, then their reviews should not carry any weight at all with you ever again.  Period.  For sure.  Picture a lonely ciabatta bun (the bottom half).  As if there were indeed a god, this bun gets married to a juicy, savory, delicious, mouthwatering patty of ground beef grilled to absolute divinity.  Who are the bridesmaids, you ask?  Tomato.  Avocado.  Lettuce.  Groomsmen?  Ketchup.  Mayo.  American cheese.  Who is the best man?  a fried egg, just waiting to burst forth with delightfulness that will dribble everywhere.  And the maid of honor?  Who so often is (admit it) the main attraction?  A red wine shallot reduction, poured on top of all of this goodness before the rest of the ciabatta comes to cap off the whole fandango.  Nay, I tell you, if you can eat that burger and not give burger bar five stars then you have a blackened soul.  Fine, you need more?  The regular patties are perfect enough to forgo the more expensive fare like buffalo or kobe but I have tried the kobe.  Get a peanut butter shake because daaaaaaaaaaaaamn!  Also they serve sweet potato fries, so who wouldn't like that?  But get the burger.  Get it the way I told you.  Throw some salt and pepper on there (ring bearer, flower girl) and you will be in absolute bliss.  Or you're a fool.",

Fried pickles, onion rings, sweet potato fries were all fantastic, skinny and fat fries were good. Great beer selection as well.",

I was pretty eager to try BurGR by Gordon Ramsay but ended up deciding to come back to Burger Bar. I'm pretty pleased with my decision.  While I typically like to try new menu items on a return visit to a restaurant, I knew I wanted another Hubert Keller Burger. Just like my previous visit, it was flawless.  I had initially dinged Burger Bar a star because I thought service was mediocre and the cleanliness level was lacking. I'm pleased to report that everything was spotless, no sticky residue anywhere, and service was spot-on.   Perhaps next trip to Vegas I'll branch out and try another burger spot.... maybe...",

Of course I had a burger, Angus to be exact which was very flavorful however the best was what my companion ordered a Buffalo Burger.  SO good.  Even though we where so full my companion insisted on order a dessert burger.  One with Nutella in the center.  This was the best donut I ever had in my life.  In between a glazed donut, holds a wonderful fudge like patty with cuts of strawberries, kiwis, and a gelled version of starfruit.  Top this off with a drizzled raspberry sauce and a little whip cream.  To Die for!    I will return and have another.  Only complain was there service is slow.",

Besides the barrage of partying, debauchery, shows, and loads of booze, it's certainly a place to indulge every desire, and food is definitely one of them.  So why did this place fail to impress? I was honestly expecting to be blown to smithereens by everyone else' experience with BB, but it was just run of the mill for me. I wanted decadence and deliciousness that I can't find anyone to compete with back home, but I can find at least one burger join in the cities I frequent that easily rival BBs offerings.",

I was willing to put up with overcooked angus but the bacon was so tough and it was too dry.

Custom burgers with just about any meat, any topping, any cheese with full on variety in fries/rings/shakes and probably anything you could dream up.  The one thing I learned on this last visit was that they have the most impressive beer line up in vegas, we are talking vintage varietels (I ended up with the Anchor Steam Christmas Brew 2008) including chimay, stone, and many other micro brew legends.  This last visit I really went for it.  Kobe Beef, add Lobster Tail, add flour de lys sauce (think Da Vinci Code), and of course sweet potato fries (note: they are no healthier than regular fries, but much more delicious).   $50 later, I am a supremely happy camper.  Now to get a burger n beer for $50 would be typically unheard of, but I truly feel I got good value and can easily win it back at the tables.  For a perfect finish try rolling around the corner and grabbing a yaegar bomb frozen concoction at the nearby yard stand (a few doors down towards luxor).",

We had a party of 7 (5 adults & 2 kids) on Sat. night for dinner at 7 and was seated less than 5 minutes with no reservations!! Wow, I was impressed and very excited to see what the fuss was all about. I've been to very good burgers joints in San Francisco, so I wanna see if this will top it . We were seated in a booth , very cozy and comfortable even for 7 of us.   I order the country natural beef burger with baby spinach, grilled onions, cheddar cheese on a sesame bun medium rare of course and order the fried sampler (fat fries, buttermilk zucchini fries & buttermilk onion rings). I custom built my burger and decided not to put any mayo, mustard, ketsup etc because it would taste better ( its the beef, right?). My total was about $23 without drink, so is it worth it?? YES,YES,YES!!!! Not only it was the Best  burger I had ever tasted , but the burger was cooked to perfection, Medium Rare !! Oh yes, WARNING, the fried sampler was a FULL order of each fried item, 3 large portions I just could not finish!! The fried zucchini and onion ring were perfectly cooked and was Delicious. Between us, all were very full and very pleased, not bad, the total billed was less than $160 (This IS Las Vegas!!). A Must Go to all Burger Lovers and YES, Burger Bar tops it all!!",

Internationally renowned French Chef does his take on the American classic.  Not the best in the world or in the country.  Burger I got was the natural, hormone free, organic, grass fed, yada, yada. It was very good, juicy, with a great char but it was not spectacular. It should be spectacular, right? It was as good as what I make on my grill. Well, mine might be slightly better. It could have used some seasoning. My friend got the veggie burger, homemade from lentils and veggies, etc. It was not that good. It fell apart...did not stick together the way you need a burger to. Not seasoned nearly enough. Nothing special and would not order again. The fries tasted like they were fried with everything else on the menu that is fried. Kind of like Jack in the Box fries. The onion rings were very good, but Ruth's Chris are better. The zucchini sticks must be made in a factory. The coating was so thick. The inside was molten liquid. No taste of zucchini. First bite we both burned our mouths. Did not eat any more. Made it hard to enjoy anything other than the iced tea. Which was fresh brewed and good. Disappointed. Ambiance: typical, loud bar with multiple televisions on. I guess it's supposed to simulate a \"sports bar.\" Service: the waiter was great, just right amount of friendly, efficient and helpful without being overly solicitous. However, the hostess acted like we were bothering her by walking up to her for a table and when we left, 3 of them were hanging out with each other like some high school click, while ignoring a couple who had just walked up for a table. Weird. Work on customer service, Huber! Shameful with all the choices to eat in LV, that your staff should be off-putting to customers.",

It wasn't that tasty and was way expensive, we spent 70 bucks pre tip on 2 burgers, one soda, one beer, and one split fried zuccinni.  Granted I got a surf and turf burger, it was a burger with half a lobster tale on it but it still would have been like 60 if I got a regular burger.  Plus the lobster was so overcooked you couldn't bite it with the burger, it sounds way better than it was.   Both burgers we had were under seasoned and nothing special, which sucks for 20 something a piece and they are served a la cart with no fries.",

Husband ordered the Kobe burger with some avocado, no cheese and I went with the no preservatives selection on a sesame bun with jack and lettuce.  I am not sure what went wrong with this combo, but the bottom bun turned to paste/mush and was really gross.  I was scraping it off to be able to eat the burger and was not eating especially slowly where I could see this happening.  He liked his burger a lot, and the fries were very good (as were my zucchini fries and the sauce sampler we got) so I only took off a few stars.  It's hard to give more than 3 stars when your main item falls so short.  The basil and truffle mayo sauces were my favorite - both were better on the zucchini than the ranch it came with!  Skip the white BBQ and the spicy ketchup, they are forgettable.  I even put the truffle mayo on my burger at some point to try and salvage it, but no dice.",

You can select what type of meat you want, they have everything from kobe beef to salmon to veggie. Then you select your toppings, again plenty of choices and then your bun type. I had the veggie burger with sweet potatoe french fries. The burger was delicious! I believe it was made with lentils and cheese and pumpkin puree? My man had an organic beef burger with bacon and seemd to enjoy it thoroughly! The drinks are expensive, $6 for a corona? But this is Vegas and there are no longer cheap options a plenty.

Waiters are friendly and bartenders very nice eye-candy.  The burger selection isn't endless, but the handful of choices you have all appear quality.    Some burger choices are Kobe beef, lamb, veggie, followed by choices in bread, cheese, and a lot of other toppings.  I ordered a veggie burger with avocado and sprouts on whole wheat.  It comes as a double veggie patty, which I didn't realize.  It was good, but from the description, I expected a little more flavor (more spiciness, specifically).  In any case, I really like the value.  It's a pricey burger but not extravagantly so, and you're full at the end.    They have about four or five styles of fries:  the sweet potato-style is a tasty, less salty-tasting, alternative.  I'd go back, as the other burgers ordered at the party looked really good.",

A decent place - basically a few set chef burgers (like the one mentioned above) and the rest is \"build-a-burger\" similar to places like The Counter, etc.  Except I've never seen $30 for 1/3oz of black truffles at the Counter.    Perhaps the most remarkable things on the menu, however, were the desserts; among numerous virgin and alcoholic milkshakes (the chocolate mint was tempting me like crazy), there were also two \"dessert burgers.\"  Both served in a warm donut bun, one had candied passion fruit to imitate cheese, chocolate ganache to imitate the patty, a mint leaf to imitate lettuce, and strawberries to imitate the tomatoes.   Ann and Nelson tried that and love it, I went with the waitress' recommendation and tried the creamy cheesecake filled donut burger with caramelized pineapple and strawberries as well.  Seriously amazing, best dessert I've had in a long while.",

It just didn't taste all that great.  And the bun doesn't work.  I think it would fare better with a brioche or pretzel bun.   Others at my table ordered the more traditional burger, which I thought was a little better.  Maybe it was the level of expectation I had, but I was disappointed.  I've had much better offerings at 25 Degrees, The Counter, and Father's Office.  Thumbs up on the sweet potato fries, but a no-go on the onion rings and steak fries.    Now about the good.  Excellent service.  The banana split with the caramelized banana - I can't complain about that!  Each booth has its own TV with ESPN.  Just wish the burgers were better!  Sorry chef Keller.  I liked you best on Top Chef Masters.",

I've seen this place many times on TV on Hubert Keller's \"Secrets of a Chef\" that was on PBS a while ago, and have been to his flagship Fleur de Lys restaurant in San Francisco.  One of the things that looked great on the TV show was the lamb burger, which has since been discontinued, so no luck there.  I wasn't up for the $65 Rossini burger, so I went with the build-your own, which was OK but nothing amazing.  The problem is that you can dig yourself into a hole with bad combinations, and there weren't that many suggestions made on the menu.  I gave it a couple of tries, and they were decent, but not great.  They had a good beer selection, which was a plus.  So, it was decent, but to be honest I probably preferred my Fatburger down the street, and definitely preferred burgers from The Counter.",

Oh, and be sure to order the sweet potato fries; they are to die for! Yummy!  The atmosphere is great, like an upscale, classy bar. Sort of reminds me of the bar area at a Del Frisco's.

    "text": "I only end up at this place out of convenience (when I'm headed to House of Blues), not lust.   Burger Bar wins the award for most expensive veggie burger.   You buy a basic burger (meat and bread) and then they have a lot of fun burger add-ons. I got a veggie burger on an onion bun with bacon -- just kidding -- avocado, blue cheese and baby spinach. Also got a side of sweet potato fries and zucchini fries. Both were good, but the zucchini fries were just battered and fried zucchini sticks. I don't know what I was thinking.   They also have a fat list of draught beers.   My two friends and I each got a burger and we all shared a pitcher and our total before tip was about $75.   The two times I've gone (primetime on the weekends) there was like a 20-minute wait. But you can take their number down, go window shopping at Urban Outfitters, and call the hostess to see if your digs are ready.   Also, look at the menu outside as you wait, so you get your grub quicker.   *   On a separate visit, I ordered a $3.50 PB-chocolate shake. Kind of expensive, right? But they give you the leftovers that won't fit in the glass, old school style.   Also tried the Buffalo shoestring fries. They were very good, by my standards. Tasted like they stole Jack-in-the-Boxes' fry seasoning recipe and applied it to a crunchy shoestring. Shoestring is the superior cut, but they were a little too crunchy.   I found out that you can order all of the burger add-ons a la carte, with out having to buy a burger. So you can basically make a salad. This news is epic. Next time I'm gonna make a $40 Lobster tail-asparagus salad.   I asked the waitress if ordering only a la carte items and no burger was common. She said a lot of vegetarians do that. Haha, pretentious ... I love it.",

I ordered the Rossini -- because this IS a Hubert Keller establishment I didn't want anything plane jane. Arguably the best burger I have ever tasted. Cooked perfectly, the truffle sauce was amazing and the fois gras was a treat I can no longer have in California. Furthermore, the Chocolate Burger dessert  was both beautiful in appearance and amazing in taste. I sat at the bar and the bartenders were very friendly and helpful. Highly recommended if you are in Vegas. Super convenient if you are staying at Mandalay, Luxor or Excalibur (it's in the shopping tunnel between Luxor and Mandalay Bay)",

I decided to go with the Kobe burger on a seaseme seed bun with Cheese. My burger was cooked perfectly. It was well done but not dry. Every bite was super tender and the bun was nice and fresh.

Located in the mall between Luxor & Mandalay Bay and with wood paneling, dark lighting and flat screens on the walls, it looked like just another sports bar.    But, once I had the food, I forgot about the setting.  We went for an early dinner around 6 p.m. on a Sunday and didn't have to wait at all.  I started off with the Lindeman's Framboise, which I think is a beer, but it tastes like Izze and is alcoholic, so even better.  BF had some kind of IPA - big draft selection.  Drink selection a-ok.  Then came the burgers - a buffalo burger for me, and surf & turf for him.  Burgers were excellent, cooked to the right medium rareness.  Fries & onion rings were perfect too.  No oily fries or loose onions after a bite.  Only complaint is that presentation was nonexistent. (I don't like seeing white on my plate unless it's done artistically.)  I also stuffed myself with the Chocolate Burger for dessert.  With donut buns, chocolate ganache meat, jello cheese, strawberry tomatos and mint lettuce, it sounded heavenly.  But, after a couple bites, it was definitely too rich for me.  Probably better to share than tackle alone.  Service is eh, but it fits the setting.",

    "text": "In Vegas, you will find no shortage of indulgences all over the strip and the Burger Bar in Mandalay Bay is no different. I went there around 3pm and was mildly surprised it'd still take about 10 minutes before there'd be a table for us. While the place is not very big, the decor is pretty nice - in each booth at the Burger Bar there are individual TVs for you to keep an eye on the game (I was there on a college football saturday).   I had the the $60 Rossini Burger (Kobe Beef, Foie Gras, and Truffles shavings). I knew I wanted it and was OK with paying the price. How was it?? It was delicious! The combination of the kobe beef, foie gras and truffles was incredible. Was it worth the $60?? Hmm... probably not. BUT, you can just get a regular Kobe Burger ($16) and add foie gras ($12) and/or truffles (1/3 oz. for $30). If you order the Rossini, however, you get fries and a \"dessert burger\" for the price of $60. Like I said, not a \"deal\" by any means, but if that's what you want, I would recommend anyone to try the Rossini once in their life. (BTW - I recommend the sweet potato fries over all other fries because we actually tried all of them)  The service was nice, the waitress kept my tea filled pretty much the entire time I was there. My only complaint is that I wish it wasn't at the extreme end of the strip. If you're not cabbing it, make sure you take advantage of the tram from Luxor. Walking to Mandalay Bay is pretty much out of the question.",

    "text": "The focus of my weekend in Vegas was certainly not food....I mean, when you show up with a dozen straight guys for a bachelor party, haute cuisine really isn't what people are thinking about. But after vomiting through an overpriced fiasco at Red Square, a 5am breakfast at Bill's Gamblin' Hall & Saloon so bad that no amount of scotch could mask it, cold fries from In 'n Out, and a soggy Reuben from Raffles Cafe in the Mandalay Bay I needed some real food.  On our last day everybody was a bit drained so I snuck away to the Spa at The Hotel at Mandalay Bay(highly recommended) but after a couple hours not even the hiss from the steam room could cover the rumbling from my stomach. I headed over to the Burger Bar as I'd heard tales of his Kobe/ foie gras / truffle burger. I felt quite confident that my fellow San Franciscan Hubert Keller would do right by me.  I was expecting something befitting of the chef of Fleur de Lys. What I found was a sports bar that could have been anywhere in the US. I checked the menu to make sure I was in the right place and yup, there was Hubert's picture beaming out at me. So I took a seat at the bar and ordered myself the famed Rossini Burger and a glass of syrah.  So a little bit about the Rossini Burger: Tournedos Rossini is a classic French dish combining Filet Mignon, Foie Gras, and black truffles. For their Rossini Burger, Burger Bar takes a sizable Kobe patty, tops it with seared foie gras, and smothers it with black truffles.  It comes with a side of rich Madeira reduction sauce and your choice of fries (I foolishly opted for zucchini....should have gotten the sweet potato). At $60 a pop it's a doozy for both your wallet and your arteries.   When it arrived I have to admit it did look pretty damn good....juices glistening down the side, truffles peaking out from under the bun....I was pretty psyched. And all in all it was pretty damn good. The meat seemed to be high quality, the foie (if a bit dried out) had that earthy sweet flavor, and the truffles had a surprising amount of oomph for it being out of season. The sauce was concentrated, rich and silky. So, what's not to like, right? But in all honesty, the whole was a bit less than sum of its parts. Perhaps it was too much of a good thing or perhaps my guilt detracted a bit from my overall enjoyment. It was all good but I can't say I'd order it again. The zucchini fries were standard but seemed out of place next to such dramatic opulence.  When I ordered, the Coyote-Ugly bartender told me that my Rossini came with dessert for which I could choose one of three \"dessert burgers\" which consisted of a split glazed donut filled with one of three options. On her suggestion I chose the cheesecake cream and broiled pineapple. And while all of those things are good, it was really exactly what it sounded like - far more fitting of Denny's than a Hubert Keller restaurant (albeit a burger joint). It just seemed a little gimmicky and over-the-top-Vegas-inspired-fat-American. Oh, and the donut was a bit stale.  Service was a bit questionable too. I was sitting at the bar so I had to contend with all the drunkards watching the Laker Utah game. With that in mind, the bartender was efficient enough. But when I asked her where the truffles had come from (I mean, I wasn't challenging her...I was honestly curious) she didn't say \"from Perigord\" or \"I'm not sure...let me go ask the chef\". All I got was an \"I have no idea\" before she sashayed away. And when she came by to see how I liked it she commented that the only time she's tried foie gras, she thought it was okay but had already had eight mojitos and probably wouldn't eat it sober. Now that's class.  So while the burger alone may have warranted four stars, the ambiance, service and stale donut reduce it to two. I might go back for a standard burger some other time as  the kitchen kicks out a mean one. Everybody should get to eat a $60 tortured animal-fungus extravaganza at least once. But, like so many things in Vegas, you just feel a little bit like a sucker. I'd feel silly about it but thanks to Carolyn at the Bellagio, I had some money to burn. So instead, I'm just a little bit fatter.",

(Mind you, I'd be willing to pay... $10 for an amazing milkshake, and cost has no factor in my decision that Johnny Rockets has the best I've tasted).

The deal was we had a time constraint and he didn't want to go to a super fancy place, since our cash was reserved for young single moms/college girls dancing ... err working their way though school. \r \r So wandering from Excalibur to Luxor to Mandalay bay we saw the Burger Bar.  \r \r Seating was easy and immediate considering it was ~ 8:00PM on a Friday night, and I'll admit our waitress was insanely cute.  The menu gives you a lot of options.  You can order pre-assembled burgers or you can choose meat, topping, cheese, bun, basically everything that will go on your burger.  One of the guys did get the Kobe beef burger, which he was very pleased with.\r \r Dessert (included when you get the Kobe burger) has an all sugar burger.  Buns are two donut halves, the lettuce is really mint, tomatoes would be strawberry ... you get the idea.\r \r Good service, very relaxed atmosphere, and you can go either way with prices.  If you've been winning, then go for the Kobe.  If not get something simple.  Either way Burger Bar is a simple place to grab a burger before you rip up the town.",

Hidden around the corner from the Mandalay Bay, this place is packed.  We waited about 20 minutes just to sit at the bar.    Is it the perfect burger? No.  Not even close.  Does it taste like a premium gourmet burger?  Yes.  But the problem likes with the fixins.  Everything is an extra charge.  Bacon, avocado, cheese, onions, grilled onions, and of course the fries.  I think i had the NY beef or the sirloin.....the kobe seemed too outrageous at the time, but i think now, i should ponied up and just threw down $$$ for tasty american wagyu.  I dont recall sliders, but i think that wouldve been a better way to go.  Unfortunately at the time, i was sporting a nice hang over from the night before at the casino bar with the boys.....10 too many kettle ones.  Anyhow, this is prob incomplete...I need to give it another go around for a better feel.",

    "text": "If you're in Vegas and you love burgers of all meats in all their exquisite forms go to Burger Bar.  If you don't go then you don't love burgers.  Period.  Situated in the shopping area of the Mandalay Bay, I caught lunch here after a rousing showing of the Lion King musical (it's really that good, but I'll save that for another review) and we were seated after a 40 min wait, which we killed time by browsing the neighboring shops.  Sneaking a peak at the other diners meals, the two of us decided to go with one big burger and one trio of sliders, rather than gorge ourselves on a couple behemoths.  I ordered their buffalo burger topped with caramalized onions and blue cheese while my friend got the slider plate that came with three mini burgers, each a different meat and combination of toppings.  Rounding out this excellent meal were a couple of milkshakes, I wish I could remember the flavours but it was almost a year ago, but I'm going to plan a return visit when I'm back in Sin City.  The only strike against our heavenly meat experience was the deep fryer was on the fritz for the day, so no fries.  I went for the cole slaw option instead as an effort towards some guilt relief.  If you're in the mood for a good burger and stuck on the north end of the strip, run, grab a cab, hitchhike down to the Mandalay for meaty goodness in a bun.",

Awesome food, great service, and generally a wonderful time was had by all.  We walked out with huge smiles on our faces and nicely filled tummies.  I ordered a burger that had \"pretty much the entire month's food ration of a small African country\" on it.  Black Angus, medium, blue cheese, jalapeno bacon, portabello mushrooms, and caramelized onions.  Sweet potato fries and a Deschutes IPA rounded out my meal.  The fries were crispy and delicious.  The patty itself was cooked perfectly and was juicy and awesome.  The toppings were completely proportioned just right -- not too much of one ingredient, not too little.  The bacon was so thick that perhaps it coulda been done a bit more crispy, but its amazing flavor more than made up for it.  The only slightly disappointing thing was the chocolate burger -- it looked INCREDIBLE, but the ganache serving as the 'patty' inside wasn't too flavorful.  Otherwise it would have been a perfect ending to our little outing!  The price was just right (at least it was just what we expected) and overall the servers made our experience just that much more awesome.  Not only did our server take care of us real nicely, but she also hooked us up with club passes for the weekend.  Although we're still not sure if we're gonna use them, it was a nice gesture on her part :)",

The service was really good. Our waitress was very attentive to us. As much as I want to like this place, it's not even that great.  I had the hubert keller's favorite burger which was like 22.00 bucks. The meat was really tender and the spinach and sauce made it taste better, but for 22 bucks, I was really expecting it to be like amazing, but the meat wasn't that flavorful to me. I was really disappointed in my burger. Maybe I just had too high of an expectation. My friend got the chicken breast burger, and it was a pretty good burger but for 15 bucks, I was kind of expecting the chicken to be more juicy and tender. My friend also said it's kind of plain so she took my sauce for my burger and put it on hers. The sweet potato fries were pretty good but it's the same everywhere else so it's nothing really special. I also brought back togo my friend an american classic burger and she said it wasn't even that great for 15 bucks.  My friend liked her burger and her experience here, but as for me, I dont think I will ever be coming back here. I've had better burgers for the price of $5.",

Anyone who knows anything about meat can't help but love this place -- I see so many people talking about the topping you can put on the burgers.  Forget all that...  If you want to spend a bit less than Order the American Kobe burger and put some normal old toppings on it and enjoy the delicious BEEF.  If you want to spend $70 than order the Japanese Kobe the way its meant to be eaten RARE and learn what means to truly enjoy life...  Once you are done order a peanut butter and jelly hamburger and a glass of milk!  ____________________ By: Ali E",

The burger really has been the best I have ever had.  The selection of toppings is extensive, but I usually stick to jalapenos and mushroom with a side of thousand island and onion rings.  The only thing I haven't been impressed with is the chili, so skip that.  The chocolate shake was great, but still $7+!.    Last time I went I had the beer tasting, so I got six or so unique and tasty beers for a reasonable price.  The premium beer selection is very good.  Also, my service has been consistently excellent.  Overall, I recommend Burger Bar.",

Buddy and I each ordered the kobe beef burger and couldn't have been happier.  The meat was prepared perfectly, and the list of available toppings was extensive.  I love that the toppings went from mild to wild and cheap to expensive.  This is probably the only place where one could get a burger with both shaved truffle slices and velveeta.  I went with carmelized onions and gorgonzola - delicious!  As others have said, you must try the sweet potato fries.  They are well worth the extra expense and are scrumptious.  One last piece of advice - do the call-ahead seating.  The restaurant doesn't do reservations, but you can call ahead up to a half hour.  My buddy and I did this and were able to walk right in upon arrival.  The place was packed, and the relatively huge line that formed behind us didn't care for us all that much.  In the end, the price was more than reasonable, given how well-prepared and customizable the meal is.  There may be a better burger somewhere else, but I certainly have yet to find it.",

My brother and I have been wanting to try this place because the chef was featured on Top Chef Masters, which is really cool, so we decided to do a little research before we went there. We went on Yelp! to see if other people had thought his restaurant was good I believe the average rating was 4 1/2 stars. The ratings made us more excited to go there.       We detoured our trip back for a bit and went to the Mandalay Bay seeking this place. After being pointed to different directions we were finally at the burger bar. It is a cool little burger joint that is darkly lit with little personal T.V.s at each booth and it also has a full time bar. Now that we were finally here we had to order. I was itching to get the Hawaiian burger well chicken burger because the description sounded good but being at a burger bar I should order the some red meat so I ordered the American, which is a classic burger. The burger came in all of it's juiciness. The patty was pretty thick so I put all so the condiments in the burger and I tried it but was sadly disappointed the burger lacked flavor in the meat. Keep in mind when a burger patty is thick I would expect some sort of seasoning but there was none. Since my brother and I had hyped up the burger bar so much we expected a mouthwatering burger but were sadly disappointed. To say the least I will continue to try new food places but mostly likely won't go back to the burger bar. Farewell, Burger Bar.",

In fact, my buffalo burger was incredibly dry and over-cooked - just being lean doesn't mean the burger has to be dry, I've had plenty of juicy buffalo burgers in my time. The sweet potato fries strangely, did not taste like sweet potatoes at all. Flavorless, in fact. Blah.",

Service was a little lacking because this place was pretty packed and our wait was about 25 minutes to get in.  the hostesses at the door were kinda stuck up...but whataya expect, this is Vegas ya kno.  but i'm glad they just opened up a new Burger Bar branch at home in Union Square SF.  being from the Bay, i'd expect the hostesses to be more down to earth and less of a bitch at the SF location",

The best quality about BB is obviously the unique variety of imported/foreign beers served. My favorites have been among many of the seasonal German based beer that have gone great with their standard burgers and sliders.  I'm typically not a burger fan in general, but the quality of their beef is choice and top notch, and even their veggie burger is something to rave about! BB is more of a place to go when I'm on the south end of the strip looking for a place to dine and dash. I usually sit at the bar itself because the service is the quickest if it's just yourself and two others. One of my local favorites!",

Why yes, a well-crafted burger with whatever the hell you want to plop, drop, dump, or slather on top, paired with a damn good milkshake, preferably with some alcohol added. My burger of choice was angus with grilled lobster tail, chipotle aioli, bacon, and avocado on an onion bun....with a coffee/Bailey's milkshake concoction thingy whose name escapes me. damn good though. And for dessert I had the tasting of 5 beer floats...5 different beers each paired with their own scoop of ice cream. Been done before of course, but 5 ways...and they were a nice size too....30 oz worth total. When you come to vegas you will come here, because I command you.",

If you are near the Mandalay in Vegas, and seek a quick/casual lunch, you must try Hubert Keller's take on the american classic.   I was here with a friend who tends to enjoy the finer things in life, so when he ordered the pricey Kobe Beef Burger, I did the same. After the first large bite into it, you should notice two key things. One: the flavor explosion of the high-quality beef bouncing around your mouth.. and Two: that captivating image of a perfect burger bite, where the juicy medium-rare meat begs you to take another bite, even while you're still chewing the first.. We both wanted to stand up and applaud.  I don't remember what the fries tasted like.",

They have a pretty good selection of burgers and various types of fries, as well as milkshakes which even include a Twinkie variety. I didn't get a milkshake but wish I had. I got a regular burger and a salad which consisted of just lettuce in a bowl.  The burger was fine, but nothing too special.  If I went back I would choose something a little more out of the box since that seems to be the way to go here.  We waited an hour for lunch on a Sunday around 2 pm!  Be prepared to pay $20 for a burger, fries, and drink which is typical Vegas pricing.",

Once we were in, I ordered myself an Atlantic Salmon Burger on a wheat bun with swiss cheese, button mushrooms, asparagus, along with a side of sweet potato fries. Our burgers took awhile to come out, but it was crowded so it was expected. When my burger came out, the salmon piece looked so thick and juicy! The waitress forgot my mushrooms though :( She brought them out separately but it just wasn't the same. Anyways, it tasted good and I eventually finished the whole burger (except some asparagus.) The burger was pretty big, and definitely met my expectations. The sweet potato fries were good as well. The were a little broken up, but wasn't over fried I guess. My friends got the Kobe beef burger and another friend ordered the salmon burger with a lobster tail on top, he said it was delicious! haha. I'll come back here when I'm in Vegas :)",

    "text": "First off, oh my goodness, have you ever watched Hubert Keller's \"Secrets of a Chef\" on PBS?  Love him. To me, he's a warm, charming, and charismatic Merlin Who Cooks, offering up wonderful recipes...teaching us plebian foodies how to preserve lemons for Moroccan tagine dishes in his lovely French accent. He makes quality and seemingly inaccessible foods and techniques approachable, and his recipes are even listed on his website for free! The mind behind a number of restaurants like the upper-end Fleur de Lys and Sleek, when he's been filmed inside his third establishment, the Burger Bar, it has always appeared to be a business-casual yet classy burger joint where you wouldn't be out of place ordering truffles or an extra side of fries.   Dude, the servers were dressed like Hooter's girls without the nylons! And weren't half as friendly! No! This is not what I expected! It really was like a bar, with uncomfortable seats, blaring music, and overpriced food. I was the only PBS geek who was going through a mental breakdown as the four of us got seated.   Ok, I thought: maybe the food belies the atmosphere. Wonderfully extensive beer & wine list. Yes, there were the creative doughnut dessert burgers. Admirably diverse burgers overall - from the kobe beef to salmon to bison...  But when the food came, nobody was impressed. My sliders were dry and lacked adequate taste, the fries were fine, and everything else others had fell into that overall category: \"fine.\" The prices would have indicated one could expect something of a higher caliber.  Before I had actually come to Burger Bar, I wanted to try a dessert burger, just for the novelty of it all. But with the meal having been so beneath what I felt were reasonable expectations, I didn't want to throw any more money away for nothing.  Oh Hubert Keller - I had such high hopes for my first experience with you offscreen. But I'm sticking to our long-distance television relationship and exploring therapy.",

I built my own burger and had the aged beef with pepper bacon, cheddar, and hangover sauce. The meat was delicious and the toppings were a perfect match for the burger. It was juicy and the potato bun was soft. I would definately recommend it to my friends as  a top place in town. The only reason it is not a 5 star rating is that it can get expensive when you build your own burger. Mine was around 20 dollars and it wasnt really that \"exotic\" to be that much (meaning i didnt add crazy stuff like shrimp or foie gras) Other than that is was awesome and I will definately go again.",

That is why I only gave them 4 stars.  The first time I was here was back in 2006. The menu was different back then. I ordered the American Kobe Burger ($16). It was really good. My friend ordered the Kobe/Foie Gras/Truffle Burger ($60). I was half way through and my friend made me take a bite of her $60 burger. It was effin of the hook!!

I had a Surf and Turf Burger which was a piece of lobster, beef patty, cheese, lettuce, asparagus and tomatoes; I selected the yam fries with this burger which were quite delicious. With a nice tic-tac-toe on top, the burger bun tasted very fresh and soft. The lobster meat was quite chewy and actually went really well with the asparagus. 3.5 out of 5 stars. On the other hand, my counterpart ordered a peppercorn burer with onion rings. The onion rings were large and crispy; however, I wasn't a big fan of the peppercorn burger. I'd give it 2.5 out of 5 stars.   This place also offered dessert burgers which would have been cool to try but I didn't feel \"dessert-y\" that time. A nice place to hang out with friends and catch up. A great place for contemporary food in Vegas!  Overall experience: 3.5 out of 5 stars",

Instead, I will focus on the best milkshake I've ever had in my life - the Chocolate Cowboy.  It was a bit pricey, running me around $11, but the chocolate was of the highest quality and the ingredients were perfectly balanced.  There were mini marshmallows that melted in my mouth instead of adding unnecessary chewiness, and everybody at the table wanted to sample the chocolate whipped cream (I reluctantly obliged).  The high point, though, was the whiskey in the milkshake.  It was perfectly proportioned where I got every bit of the flavor of the whiskey, but it stopped just before the normal \"burn\" of sipping whiskey would come into play.  It was absolutely incredible.  If you're up to turning the normal $$ of Burger Bar into a $$$, definitely hit up their milkshakes - you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "I rate this place 3.5 to 4 stars for the burger but maybe it's because I opted out of ordering the $60 kobe burger (i mean, seriously?) and got the American Classic for $13.  Coming from Chicago which really has such excellent burgers, nothing overly mind blowing about the American Classic burger except the juiciness of the beef and that the overall burger kind of melts in your mouth. However , I was expecting a bigger cut of meat and perhaps a bit more flavor in the meat. It was a little bland and needed more pepper.  And the fries...ive definitely had better...ugh!  I also give 2 to 3 stars for beer selection on tap! At first i was like \"oh wow, they have a large selection of beers on tap.\" I had the 6 beer sampler and only liked only 1!  (keep in mind i'm a picky beer drinker and i like microbrews and non domestics  such as Guinness.) This place seems to cater more to light beer lovers, as opposed to dark beer lovers.    The amber beer  was the best of the 6 and we really liked! So tasty and  good for dark and light beer drinkers! On tap, the flavor is balanced and bursts in your mouth with complexity.   The rest of the beers were very ordinary. The Oktoberfest was not what i was expecting- light and hoppy. The Kona Porter had the texture and smoothness of Guinness but no flavor really. The rest of the beers tasted like budweiser  or just too hoppy and light for my tastebuds.   Note: We went for late night dinner. I recommend this as more of a lunch spot. Just seems to fit better in ambience and food for that type of meal.",

I thought it was going to be a thick handmade patty from fresh (never frozen ) beef, Cooked to perfection so you get that char flavor on the outside while still remaining juicy, Not so, It was just a patty, Might as well have gone to Carl's JR. I think it would have been better, And I asked which would beef would make the better burger, and went with the more expensive Angus beef because I wanted a great burger experience, Again it would have been so so, but because I went out of my way to eat  there, I got to say it a TOTAL let down, My wife got the Chicken sandwich they boast is cooked to perfection while remaining juicy and I had a few bites, It was a thin previously frozen patty that was so dry it was sucking my will to live, Carl's JR would have been way better on that  front, I am not the vindictive type, I just wish someone where honest about it , Someone  that know there hamburger's so I could have avoided this train wreck, I will never go again.",

    "text": "Okay, so I am not a vegetarian, however I don't really eat beef anymore ever since I realized I have nightmares every time I eat it. So anyway, I ordered their veggie burger with bacon (ask for it crispy if you want it crispy, otherwise it comes sort of limp), grilled zucchini, pesto, cheddar on an onion bun and a side of fries. Their veggie burger was sort of a bland mushy rice ball that just broke apart while eating. So, finally I just ate all the bits with my fork instead of trying to pick it up. But honestly, it wasn't very good. The music was so loud we could hardly have a conversation, and the waiter even apologized for not hearing our order very well he semi-shouted (sorry, it's REALLY loud in here!). They have \"flavored sodas\" which I thought was going to be like an Italian soda or something. In reality, they just add the syrup flavor of your choice to their pre-existing tap sodas, so pepsi, diet pepsi, sierra mist etc. I did choose to make my sierra mist strawberry flavored and it was fantastic. In summary, I will not be back.",

Also had the sweet potato fries...they were awesome.  A must try.  In my opinion they taste way better than regular fries.  Service was attentive and cheerful.  Would've given this place 4 stars if it wasnt for one of the snooty hostess in the front.  We placed our name on the wait list for a table of 2 and were told it would take about 15 minutes so we walked around and checked out the nearby shops.  Came back in about 10 minutes and checked to see where we were on the list.  The snooty hostess snapped...there's a couple more people in front of you and we told you it would be a 20 minute wait and it's only been 5!  First off, I didnt reserve a table with you.  Second, your more customer-oriented co-worker said it would be 15 minutes.  Third, we waited well over 5 minutes.  I enjoyed the food.  Front of the house needs more training.",

We did sweet potatoes- awesome, onion rings amazing bite right threw and the onion doesn't string out, the very best.... Zucchini fries off the chart good. Probably best we all ever had!  Burgers... We ordered 2 create your own  1st- hamburger fried egg Swiss pretzel roll bun, avocado and regular toppings. It was awesome. The flavor of the meat was perfect and cooked perfect too  2nd veggie burger on a chibato roll with provolone fried egg and asparagus. Thank goodness we had some dipping sauce from the fries. Because it was so good at all. No flavor and mushy.   Dessert... They were sold out of what we wanted dang it.   Would we go back? No fun one time thing. It was just ok in the burger department awesome in the dry. Next time I'm going just for fries.",

The booths have TVs where you can watch sports center or whatever game of the day is on. They have a full bar, a lot of beers on tap, and an extensive shakes with booze menu.   Foodwise, there's something on there called a billionaire burger with Kobe (style) beef, Foie Gras, and truffle mayo.   I just got a baguette burger. It was really really good.  My paranoia when it comes to baguettes is that i'm going to get some stale loaf that cuts the roof of my mouth, or gives my teeth a workout. It was actually almost an amazing piece of bread. It if had been only a tiny bit softer, it would've been the best baguette burger of my life. Honestly, it was pretty close.   The meat was cooked perfectly. There was enough fat in the ground beef for it to ooze flavor when I bit into it. The Gruyere was melted evenly and just had just the right amount of gooeyness. The arugula was fresh and the garlic aioli was flavorful but not overly so. The fries were also good, crispy and fresh.   Here's the best part: every single time I've been here the service has been top notch. These ladies really know their stuff, and make me that much more likely to return in the future. Great job",

    "text": "I must've completely missed the bandwagon of hype for Burger Bar. Based on all the pretty good reviews I went in expecting something spectacular. I was staying at the Mandalay Bay and upon check-in I was awarded a food and beverage credit! I've dined several times at many of the restaurants here so i thought let me try something new and get a good burger!   OpenTable had some available reservations! Oh I just love the ease of being able to book yourself and show up! Upon arrival I was greeted by McKenzie who helped them earn another star because if it wouldn't have been for her I was most definitely going to rate this a two star experience! It's so refreshing to have a nice hostesses I just wish our actual server was just as pleasant. Once we were seated Mila the server came over did her quick little spill about the menu and left.. The restaurant closed at 11:00 PM and our reservation was the last one at 10:30! I get it it's not always the best to show up close to the time the place is closing however that doesn't mean that the customer service and hospitality should take a hit. We were pretty much rushed to order and when we had questions about the menu our server seemed reluctant to answer. After finally deciding on what to order the decision came down to:  Appetizer   Poblano Poppers- pretty Damn Good!  Well Done Wagyu Kobe Burger w/ Sesame bun & Fries  Wagyu Kobe Burger w/ Onion bun & mozzarella sticks  Final Thought: MEH...Most expensive mediocre burger I've ever had. Most definitely not worth it! Only way I'd return to even consider trying maybe another item is if the casino is paying for it it.. I left feeling like I would've been better off going to CHECKERS and got my 2 For $5 Bacon Roadhouse..",

I'm not sure if they've changed chefs, or their kitchen crew, cause I was hugely disappointed. I ordered a Hubert Keller burger to be cooked medium rare, and when my burger came it was well done. Huge disappointment. Dried out meat, burned onions tasted bitter... I didn't want to complain, because I know if I do, they'll take it away and it will be another 40 min wait. All my guests were already eating, so it would be terrible for me to sit there without food and watch them eat. Service was sub par as well. I ordered a milk shake and it took them 45 min to bring it out/make it. I don't get it. They weren't busy, there were plenty of empty tables in the restaurant. So making a milk shake for 45 min was inexcusable. We kept asking the server and she wasn't of much help either. The only reason I'm giving them 2 stars, were the quality of their French fries. That's about it. I'm sad to say this, but I think this was my last visit to this restaurant.",

Pick your toppings from like a zillion options, pick your bun (or go low carb and skip the bun). It is then cooked to your liking. There are pre-designed burgers to choose from if you get \"option anxiety\". There's even a healthy page on the menu for those looking to eat clean.   The sweet potato fries are always a winner in my book. I also recommend the chop salad here. It's a very generous size and comes in a big bowl and is great for sharing!   Because this is a long narrow restaurant, it always feel tight and cramped, even if it's not crowded. If you're claustrophobic at all, you might want to skip this place or just sit up front near the entrance.",

The food comes out quick and it is a good place to hang out and watch a game or just grab a fast bite The atmosphere is very casual as it is tucked inside the shopping area, and if you have to use the restroom you have to walk all the way to the back and outside of the restaurant into a shady hallway...I would suggest holding it until you get back into the hotel or casino.

    "text": "Popped in for dinner at 7pm during CES week. Place is bigger than it looks from the front and goes quite far back with two separate bars. 15 minute wait for a table or plenty of seats at the back bar for the two of us which we took advantage of.   We started off with a local IPA from their hefty selection of beers. Our server was friendly and had an impressive selection of catchy phrases. Everyone I saw working there was really hustling and moving with purpose. I don't know if they were short staffed this night but they were earning their tips.   We both built our own wagyu beef burgers from a plethora of toppings. We skipped the $30 truffles ha ha. I was super tempted to get one of their monster shakes but resisted. A guy next to us did and it looked yummy.   My only complaint for dinner was the wait after ordering for our food. Maybe it takes 30 minutes to prepare wagyu medium but it seemed long to us.",

I grabbed a bite from my friends Kobe burger...it was perfection and made me have super burger envy! Get the Kobe Beef Burger!! Don't waste your time with the sliders - they came out cold and a bite tasteless.  If you happen to be friends with people who don't eat meat (my apologies), The Burger Bar has some pretty decent vegetarian options as well. My other friend loved her veggie burger and skinny fries.   What is a burger without a milkshake? So I HAD to order the Chocolate Cowboy...oh my! 16 oz of delicious Whiskey goodness! :)  The palce gets packed but there was plenty of room at the bar. They have tvs everywhere and on different games so you can catch up on your golf, soccer, or baseball.",

I usually load my burger up with cheddar cheese, blue cheese, onion, bacon, and the basic lettuce/mayo.   I was first told about this place from a friend who thought I ought to try it since I had expressed my love of burgers and lived in Las Vegas for so long.  Although this place is pricey (it's costed between $70-$100 each time I've gone with one other person) it's well worth it if you're craving a fabulous burger and it's a date night!(:",

The burger tasted exactly how you would expect a Kobe burger with fried egg, bacon, cheese, and a lobster tail would taste....delicious!  This place has dim lighting and a bit of a pub feel to it.  The beer selection is good and i guess you can probably call this a Gastropub.    The second time i got the buffalo burger with bleu cheese which was also quite good.  I tried some of my wife's kobe burger with foie gras and that was pretty tasty too.  I'd definitely recommend this place if you are looking to try a 20-30+ dollar burger.   :)",

I was pretty excited since I'm a big fan of gourmet burgers and there were good things being said about this place.  We stopped by during dinner time and they made us wait, which is fine. We wandered around the surrounding shops until they called us.  Service was quick, and nice. I ordered a Kobe burger and thought it was pretty delicious. However... I gotta say, it wasn't worth the $17 I paid for it. I've had my fair share of gourmet burgers and this was NOT worth $17. Maybe $12. No more.   I left satisfied, but not. I just couldn't help but feel ripped off. Maybe living in California has spoiled me a bit and we have plenty of amazing gourmet burger joints out here for way less!   Sorry, but if you're charging me $17 for a burger, it better blow my damn mind.",

Well maybe I should have not set such high expectations and I wouldn't have been so let down.  Decor, great, loved it. Comfy booths with individual tvs at your table. Awesome. Cute, friendly waitresses. Cool. I am sure she had nothing to do with the 50 minute wait to get my burger. Really.  We were vanished so it didn't take long to decide. My other half went with the hangover burger. I went with the do-it-yourself style. I included cheddar, grilled peppers and onions, homemade mustard (YUM) and spicy ketchup. I could tell the quality of meat was there on the burgers. This was no frozen pre made burger. All the ingredients were fresh. But NOTHING stood out to make my burger $19.75. We also got a milkshake and some cheese shots. (deep fried pepperjack) Our tab came to over $60!! for burgers that were just OK that we waited almost an hour on. No thanks, never again. Move along.  I don't mind paying extra for it all, service, food, atmosphere, ambiance.  But all of it was simply mediocre.  Waste of time, heels, money, and hunger.  NEXT!",

I tried the peppercorn burger and hangover burger. The peppercorn one (actually I\"m not sure if that's what its called) was really tasty and different. It has dijon mustard though so if you can't take wasabi-like spiciness, you shouldn't get this burger. The hangover burger was even better! The sauce was mixed with the lettuce and idk.. it was just good. They also let you just build your own burger and put on your own dressing and toppings.   They also have really good sauces! I tried the basil aoili, white bbq sauce (bbq +mayo mix I think) and truffle mayo. My boyfriend liked the white bbq sauce one a lot, and the basil aoli with fries tasted like eating pesto pasta haha. The truffle mayo tasted really good with my burger. However, it took so long for them to give us the sauces that I was almost done with my burger before I got it :(",

I tried the sliders, which is a nice way to sample some of the different meats (loved the Buffalo) and my son did up a custom burger with bacon and a fried egg, which he loved.  Their onion rings are killer, but the cheeze sticks and the fried mac and cheese seemed to have come from Costco or something - nothing special.  Their spicy ketchup and the aoli sauces were both amazing, with both the burgers and the onion rings and fries.  We tried the truffle mayo, though and that was pretty disappointing.  It just tasted like mayo.  And it was $1.50 for  tiny side of it, where as the far superior aoli and spicy ketchup was only $.50.  (Be sure to ask because while they advertise a sampler of sides and sauces, they actually charge you for each one!  It was a bit confusing.)  The milkshakes, too, were SO good, too. My son did a custom one with some crazy concoction of stuff but I had the Black and White, which was killer.  I could have eaten a whole bowl of the chocolate whipped cream alone.   Really a good place with tasty food.  If you are a burger and/or milkshake fan, you'll enjoy this place!",

The beer is always great there are always different selections for you to chose from. I love that you can create your own burger. The meat selection is always fresh mouth watering goodness. Prices are ok, but this is the strip and its high quality beef so its priced at a reasonable amount. Oh and they have little TVs in EVERY BOOTH!! How could you go wrong with that?  I have ordered a few things here, all consistent and great. Kobe beef burger which was great, came out perfect for med rare. Not too bloody not too well done. I kept it simple with cheese, lettuce, tomato, and NO SAUCE! Onion rings which where amazing and the Number 9 beer went great with this meal.  The next time I got a USDA organic beef burger. Pretty standard, except I threw on some blue cheese, caramelized onions, lettuce, and no other sauces. A-MAZING!! Not as juicy as the Kobe wagu burger but up to par with what I was expecting. The beer I can not remember since it was a recommendation from my service who got it spot on, it was excellent. I order the Zucchini which by the way with there ranch was sooooo good.  I've never ordered a shake here but they are spouse to be good as well.  Great burger joint in a very uncrowded little strip of the mall, the walk there is longer from parking but not that bad. Make the trip its worth it and if you do have to wait, there is a lush cosmetics store where you can get face mask, soap and just browse to kill time.",

We were trying to eat a healthier than we had been that day. The Cobb salad was so big and very good except the blue cheese overpowered the salad and it made it hard to finish, which would be my only complaint. I would order that without the blue cheese next time. My fiance ordered the salmon burger that had a green, organic side salad with vinaigrette dressing. The salmon was cooked medium and was flavorful and filling. We also ordered a side of skinny fries and it's exactly what I like in a French fry. Thin, slightly salty and not extremely crispy. Yum. We finished everything except the last of the Cobb salad cuz we were over the blue cheese. The server gave us ice water with lemon and would refill our water giving us lots of ice which we LOVE. Nothing is more gross than getting luke warm water with no ice. The server was very nice and prompt. It was $36 for both is us. Not bad at all!!! We opted for this place instead of the Top of the World at the stratosphere where our friends were going. That place is too rich for our blood.  We had an awesome experience at Burger Bar and left satisfied without breaking the bank. I'm happy they were open late too! Not sure why a lot of other places in Vegas close at 10 or 11. I would definitely recommend this place.",

I take it you'll be tipsy / drunk coming here which will make it taste better.  Not sure how the meat options are. I'm rating this as if I were vegetarian.  They have a vegan option which is a giant stack of grilled vegetables between portobello mushrooms that comes with fries for $12. I was told it was good.  if you sit at the booth you get 3 channels, 2 of which are sports and the other is music trivia, I'm not sure why it exists but if you don't feel like looking at your friends you could just watch TV.

We were there around 11:30am and walked right in, but the night before there was about an hour wait for dinner time. We were seated at a booth table which feels very private because the booth walls go very high up. You also get your own TV at the table so you can enjoy the game.  With my Bloody Mary already in hand, I was in heaven reading over this menu. We decided to keep it semi light and split their wedge salad with the Hubert Keller Burger substituted with Zucchini Fries. It was all delivered hot and quickly. Great flavors, burger actually cooked to proper temperature and waitress put up with our random little requests throughout our meal.

    "text": "Burger + Bar.  Two words that were meant for eachother. From the Michelin chef that brought us Fleur de lys, comes Burger Bar, aka every man's dream. Diners can choose from a menu of pre-designed burgers or customize their own starting from bread type to the quality of beef (chicken, salmon and veggie options also available), and of course tons of toppers such as sprouts, pineapple, avocado, fried egg and jalapeno bacon to name only a few.  So what makes this burger joint stand out from the rest?  Well the quality is top notch, their beer selection is impressive and they offer hoity toity toppings like foie, lobster, and truffle.  Their milkshakes would make even the most disciplined dieter fail for sure. Oh yeah, and you can build your own shake too! Oh, the possibilities!  Their sweet potato fries are addicting and unlike other places (The Counter, ahem) they keep my ranch dressing coming, with no additional charge.  They have salads too, but let's be honest, who would even dare to order one with burgers like these?  True to Vegas style, BB is open until 3am on Friday and Saturday.",

The location of the Burger Bar is between Luxor and Mandalay Bay at the Mandalay Place Mall. I wasn't sure what to expect, but sure was great my boss wanted to go here. I was supposed to go here last November, but my plans had switched because of the Pacquiao fight.  We were greeted by a beautiful lady and placed on the tables near the entrance because the booths were full. My boss wanted to see the Football game, but at the same time have a great meal with our work money. I opened up the menu and I see this expensive $60 burger. Foie Gras Burger...What?! Geez. I ordered the American Classic with skinny fries ($14). I am not sure what my boss ordered since it was a customized burger, but sure was delicious for both of us. I guess I am willing to pay $14 for a burger, but not a dime more.  The atmosphere was awesome and people were just having fun watching the game either with the MLB or NFL. The American Classic Burger is a MUST!!! One day...I will order the Foie Gras Burger...just need to win $60 bucks.....  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",

I do like the concept of building your own burger. To those of you in the Bay Area, its like The Counter but better  Opted for the Kobe beef (although it was delicious, I didn't notice a difference between your USDA beef). I was smacking myself in the head for totally overlooking to add some kind of sauce to the burger (big mistake). Great atmosphere, TVs, and I highly recommend the ICE CREAM SHAKES. One of the best shakes I've ever had You won't be disappointed & well worth the price.  This place will become a staple for future Vegas trips for me",

    "text": "List time!  When I like a place a lot I tend to ramble on and on and on and on about nothing.  I get all excited and talk about every little detail that I can remember in order to paint a picture of how fantastic of a place the place I like is.  This place is no different.  As you can see... I'm already rambling and I didn't even start talking about the place yet.  What does that mean?  That means I LOVE this place.  So in an effort to skip the rambling I will make a list of why I love Burger Bar...  1.) Hubert Keller- he is the chef behind this place.  He owns a fancy schmancy restaurant called Fleur de Lys that I have not had the pleasure of going to... I hear it's amazing.  He is amazing.  He is a wonderful man and a wonderful chef.  One of my faves in the world.  2.) Build-it-yourself- you get to pick what kind of meat goes on your burger (Kobe, black angus, country natural, etc), what type of bun, what toppings, etc.. The choices and possibilities are endless... they have so many choices it's ridiculous and all their ingredients are high quality making for a fantastic burger experience.  3.) Service- the staff is attentive and friendly and always ready to make great recommendations for your palate  4.) Milkshakes- two words: Nutella. Milkshake.  5.) Jalapeno bacon.  Boom.  Okay... so... this actually is a topping that is so good it deserves its own reason.  The jalapeno bacon is SO GOOD.  I'm really not sure how they were able to infuse the jalapeno flavor so well into the bacon... but it is so perfectly balanced with bacon and jalapeno flavor that you start to wonder if a pig and a jalapeno had a love child that resulted in this wonderful creation.  What?  Seriously... you do.  Okay, okay... maybe you just think they fed a pig jalapenos.  No but seriously... it has great flavor.  When I went to Vegas the trip was only about 4 days but we ate here twice.  The first time I went I ate my burger w/ the jalapeno bacon and that flavor mixed with whatever else I put in was the best burger I've ever had in my life.  The second time I went I was without the jalapeno bacon and opted for the truffle sauce and some other stuff resulting in an okay burger.  Now I'm not saying that the jalapeno bacon is a make or break ingredient... I'm just saying that all the ingredients you put when you build your burger will make or break it... so choose wisely.. very very wisely.  Did I ramble?  Darn it I did.  Fail.  Fail for me... not the burger.  The burgers are excellent.  Just the burgers by themselves are excellent... without anything on them.  Seriously.  Okay wait I'm doing it again.  Rambling that is.  Darn.  I really do like this place.  Really.  Go try it.",

I have had a few \"kobe-style\" burgers and this was by far the toughest I have had...and it was cooked medium rare at that.  Other people in the party I was with had the black jack burger and the Hubert Keller burger which they seemed to enjoy quite a bit.  The fries were pretty tasty--we had the thick fries and the potato fries--and the zucchini fries were pretty awesome--perhaps the highlight of the meal.  They have a really nice selection of beers but also happened to run out of the one paticular beer I ordered, so I ended up getting a caramel latte milkshake, which I enjoyed most out off all the items I ordered.  In the end, the bill for four of us was about $130 including tax and tip...perhaps a little more than you'd anticipate from a burger joint, and quite a bit more than I would be willing to pay to go back...maybe I will have to try BLT Burger next time...  Happy Eating!!!",

    "text": "Two of my good friends were in town. We had the grandest of intentions of getting all dolled up and hitting the Strip for a Friday full of debauchery. What ended up happening was us, drinking vodka in their hotel room and stumbling for a late dinner at Burger Bar, where we proceeded to stuff our faces so full and then go immediately back to the hotel room to hit the hay. (When did I get so ooooooold?)   Anyway, unlike my experience at Holsteins (which I do like better even though I give them both the same star rating)  I did have a boozy milkshake. It was not that impressive. Don't get me wrong, I love a milkshake and I still drank it all, but I wanted it to smack me in the mouth with alcohol, which it did not. Mint chocolate chip with chocolate whipped cream and an alleged mint liqueur for $10.75.  I ordered the Hubert Burger. I have a huge admiration for the chef (Public TV FTW) and also inventive recipes, especially those involving blue cheese. Buffalo meat (a hard find... coming from South Dakota where it's everywhere), spinach, caramelized onions, blue cheese and a wine reduction sauce on the side for $22. It was spectacular, though perhaps not the best choice combined with my previously vodka-soaked stomach and liver and the aforementioned boozy milkshake.   We also ordered a sauce selection for the table. You're not coming to Burger Bar to save money or to eat healthy, so just do it. White barbecue, basil aioli, truffle mayo, homemade mustard, chipotle aioli were our choices. Loved them all but particularly the truffle mayo and homemade mustard. Mmmmm.   The decor and bathrooms are where the stars really plummet for me. Bathrooms are forever away, passing by the back-of-house restaurant rooms on the way. The decor looked like it was schlepped together and doesn't match a $22 burger.   However, we really enjoyed our experience and the service was great. I would try it again!",

    "text": "I was staying at the Mandalay Bay for a work retreat last weekend and had seen quite an array of restaurants in The Shoppes at Mandalay Bay. The Burger Bar was one of them and had an enticing concept - I could build my own burger. However, once I sat down, the menu itself with pre-determined types of burgers looked fantastic already. I could've built my own milkshake but their choices rocked already.  So what did I do? I opted for a brewski while my co-worker couldn't resist the Nutella milkshake (seriously, a NUTELLA MILKSHAKE!). I snagged a bottle of Deschutes Black Butte Porter for $5 which wasn't too shabby considering it was Vegas. Her milkshake was probably around $8 and oh so delicious. It was creamy and full of Nutella goodness without being overwhelming. There was nice thick consistency to the drink that a lot of milkshakes seem to miss when they are too thin or too thick. My porter was nice and smooth but didn't pair all too well with my burger. Regardless, I enjoyed it!  I opted to grab some buttermilk zucchini fries with my peppercorn burger (NatureSource beef with fresh and dried peppercorn, Dijon mustard, peppercorn cream, tomato, red onion, and lettuce) since I prefer them over regular fries. Aren't they healthier? Well anyhow, they were deep-fried to perfection and great with the ranch I asked the waitress for. The burger, now that was something. When you price a burger at $18, you get a lot of expectations from the client (well and again, it was Vegas). I think Burger Bar delivered. My peppercorn was just the right amount of peppery spice; I think the fresh peppercorn really gave a sweeter twist to the meal. The patty cooked medium rare really staved off my beefy desire as its natural juiciness made the meat so desirable. Paired with the creamy peppercorn sauce, it was fabulous burger. How did I deal with the guilt of such a huge burger? Whole wheat bun!",

    "text": "No me gusta. No me gusta at all.  This should be my favorite place in Las Vegas: Artisan Burgers and amazing beer both local and foreign. Even the service was grand. What went horribly wrong? There are two factors that make this place a definitive nope: one is the price of everything is out of touch with reality. Sure this is in the Mandalay Bay on the strip, but it's actually in one of those weird connector mini-malls we have so many of. This is a very nice retail passageway, but it's not actually Mandalay Bay proper. Even if it were I am sure I could find a greater value in food virtually anywhere else in the Mandy.  The problem isn't just the prices, which are certainly atrocious, it's just that the burgers aren't good. I had the Hubert Keller signature burger. It wasn't great. The meat wasn't particularly flavorful,  the red wine and shallots sauce was vinegary and the side of the chipolte aioli was bland and seemed old. The Buffalo was dry the previous time I came here and I chalked it up to being the nature of the meat. It's not, I've had spectacular buffalo since and much better value.  The beer list is utter torture. It's glorious in it's depth and yet should anyone actually pay those prices they should immediately be carved into servings and fed to starving African Children. A handy strip mark-up is one thing, within reason. But charging eight times retail for a beer readily available at local gas stations almost almost makes me want to go all Reductio ad Hitlerum up in this review. I scoured the beer menu and could not find a purchase I was willing to make. I cannot remember the last time I went to a restaurant such as this and just had a soda. I actually did not purchase a beer.  If you can afford this place go to a burger restaurant that actually has decent food. Better yet check out e by jose andres and save a few bucks.",

I wanted to get the $60 burger but didn't feel like getting disappointed if it did not live up to my expectations.  I got the kobe beef, swiss cheese, caramelized onions, and jalapeno bacon on an onion roll with sweet potato fries. I tried the Lagunitas beer which I liked at first but towards the end did not care for it anymore. I discovered ranch dressing and ketchup mixed together are a good combo.  The next day I got pretty ill and still am two days later with food poisoning, I am not sure what did it since I was the only one that got it sick.

    "text": "I had a friend visiting from England and we decided to meet here since this is located at the hotel where he was staying at. I have never been to burger bar, so I was really excited, knowing it is owned by a renowned chef. I ordered the Twinkie Shake and the American burger with extra caramelized onions. Sad to say, they sound better than they taste. The burger was dry and lacked flavor, and the shake wasn't really anything to race about. I did love the zucchini fries, but that's about it. Service was also just okay. Overall, I was just very unsatisfied and felt like it was a complete let down compared to all the hype. Not sure if I will be back again.",

Points for the sweet potato fries, they were average but nice to have the option.    My burger came over cooked and on a cibatta bun that was way to bready.  Maybe if I stayed away from the cibatta it would have tasted better, or atleast like a burger.",

They have the biggest selection of toppings, and all different types of burgers but we knew from the start KOBE beef was what we desired. It was really good but with all the toppings you don't need to get kobe, the sirlon burger I'm sure would be just as tasty. So next time,actually this April we will devour another burger loaded with toppings.   As for the wait time, it was about 30 minutes and the service was good. We'll follow up with another review next month after trying something new.",

I love just building my own burger with the array of meats and toppings to choose from. And unlike so many places like this and in Vegas, the portions aren't overwhelming - big, but not huge and gross.   It's also worth noting all of the booths have their own TVs - great place to view the game (ie: take a break from the Sports Book when there's only one game being aired during the first round of March Madness).",

    "text": "This place is amazing and great for the money! You get what you paid for. I had the veggie burger w/ avacodes and jalepenos as extras and added ZUCCHINI FRIES. The fries are very good. YOU can take anyone with you including meat eaters, picky kid/adults, vegans/ vegetarians. They have vegan milkshakes and other wonderful shakes but for $5 you can get a frozen pina colada and it was the best thing I had in my 3 days at Vegas and its only $5!! They have strawberry daquiries for $5 too and it's very big with lots of whipped cream too.  Veggie Burger Zucchini fries  Pina colada (frozen drink virgin)   $22 with tip. It's worth it and yeah buffets are cheaper.   *TIP: You have to wait about 10 to 30 minutes depending on when you go. I went for lunch.  *TIP: Try their unique fries (zucchini or sweet potatoes instead of the usual)  *TIP: You can MAKE your own burger or add topping to burger combinations they already have. They have seafood burgers too.  *TIP: It's close to FAT TUESDAYS so you can get a drink from there and eat here if you want more varieties.  COOL INFO: The head chef Mr.Keller was on TOP CHEF and is a finalist on TOP CHEF MASTERS on BRAVO TV. We saw him there and I was so tempted to say hello but I was too shy lol. He is an amazing chef.",

Sorta bad but I forgive just this once: - Service was good although I think they might have forgotten our order because we waited a good 30 minutes before we got our food... - There was a small piece of plastic in my girls burger, dunno what from but other than that the food was just fine",

I ended up making my own mushroom & swiss burger with Black Angus beef -- not very exciting. The beef was really fresh but overcooked. The fries were hot and tasty but nothing special. They were just piled on a plate and didn't come with any dipping sauces.   Let's just say I wasn't impressed -- I expected more from a potential Top Chef Master...",

They have composed burger offerings and they have the any way you want it option, which is the way I roll at The Burger Bar.  Great fries, the pass the Mickey D's test.  Don't be shy about calling an audible and going to the onion rings, they are tasty!  The selection of beers is fantastic.  The staff is awesome, they will take good care of you while you're there.

They also have a really cool \"burger\" dessert menu (donut buns with dessert stuff on the inside) - most of those run about $5.  The atmosphere is very upscale bar-like, with little TVs in each booth.  I had the Turkey Burger on Wheat with Skinny Fries and it was the tastiest turkey burger I've ever eaten!

My hands were practically shaking at the thought of yummy sweet potato fries *adores*   What I Thought: So not pretentious! With a chef as famous as Hubert Keller, you'd think the place as a stench of snobbery to it, but it doesn't all. Very casual, elbows on the table can we get you meat and beer type joint. The servers were too slow for my taste and didn't check in on us but one time. it would've gotten 5 stars had it not been for that   Who I Dragged Along: Ros and our Mommy (yea, i still say Mommy)   Atmosphere: Clean, modern, dark wood, dimly lit with TVs at the booths with some sort of football game on.   Price: Our bill including tip came out to be $55 or so   What We Ate: My mommy is a semi-vegetarian and she said their veggie burger was seriously the best thing she ate during our Mother/Daughter's weekend in Vegas. Unfortunately she refused to get onion rings since she's against all things fried.   Me: turkey burger on sesame with sauteed portebello mushrooms, provolone cheese (for extra stringy cheesy goodness), bacon (pork fat ftw!!!), lettuce, tomatoes, onions with a side of sweet potato fries and chipotle aoili for dippin   Mommy: Veggie burger on Wheat with lots of hot sauce, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, tomatoes and onions.. and ate of our plats of fries   Ros: black angus burger with Cheddar, bacon, tomatoes, lettuce, onions with a side of skinny fries   Shared: chocolate burger for dessert (yummmm, dark chocolate goodness)   Parking: We walked over from MGM, but its Vegas, there's parking everywhere!   Would I Come Back: Next time I'm in Vegas.. sho nuff! I hope Hubert opens one in the Bay, that would rock sooo hardcore   Did i miss anything?: Hubert Keller is one of my ultimate Chef crushes, being a wannabe chef myself i adore his culinary point of view plus.. its damn friggin great burgers!",

All three times, I've had some form of addition and subtraction to my basic burger - medium juicy patty and a ton of fresh raw onion.  That to me is probably all I would go for on a normal day... no cheese.  Cheese always seem to overtake the taste of everything else it's added on, for me.  But add an egg cooked over-easy, real bacon and some jalepenos... omfg - I'm having a burgasm!  I always almost have the black angus 'coz I wouldn't get the kobe beef.   I just think it's kind of silly that they called it American Kobe beef... Kobe as we all know, is nowhere near America and the ones they serve here are from Idaho... ummm...   But this is a good place for a cold beer (they really are as cold as beer should be, I'm told), a very very VERY good Burger and a nice ambiance with surprisingly not many rowdy kids considering it's a burger place - maybe they too are too busy  having their mini burgasms to be annoying :)  Again, they might need a new host (she's as stupid as she looks) but everyone else is great.  Still can't get over the twins who work there - they always throw me off :)",

And the buffalo burger at Burger Bar is so good. They have a ton of toppings if that's your thing, but I just need cheese. Throw a pickle and some lettuce on there, mustard and steak sauce. I need one now!  Good onion rings, crispy fries and a great selection of beers here. Full bar too! Service is good, there is a small wait most of the time, but just do what I do and sit at the bar. TV's everywhere so you won't miss the game.  Some special notes about my new favorite meat...  Buffalo contributes about 69% more iron to your diet than beef; with higher levels of vitamins, minerals, and twice as much Beta-Carotene as grain-fed meats. It's also high in essential fatty acids and has an excellent ratio of Omega-3 to Omega-6 acids. All things considered, it's a perfect way to enjoy the full, rich flavor of beef without the guilt.",

But we both tried a Kobe Beef burger. I was amazed by the variety of toppings you could add to your burger ranging from dairy to culinary delicacies. I had the Kobe Beef burger with Cinnamon Bacon, and Swiss Cheese. It was delicous the Kobe Beef just melted in my mouth as I heard Kobe Beef is supposed to do. I also had a Black and White Milkshake which was fantastic, and they give you the rest of the can. Overall, a most go for any burger lover. The atmosphere was definetly not the fine dining I was expecting at Mandalay Bay, it was more like a wild west saloon.  Side Note: I discovered the reason the Kobe Beef burger is so popular is because the farm treats the cows in a humane way, and feeds them beer to make the meat more tender. The whole feeding beer to a cow makes me wonder if the cows are drunk all the time. But I digress.",

They cook em to order, the fries are good and it's about what you'll spend at any other place in Vegas.

They were open late on a Friday night, when my boyfriend and I just arrived, so after a long 3 hour drive, we were starving, and craving something too good to be True.  We knew exactly what we wanted...a KOBE BEEF BURGER.  now this is the 2nd time we've been here, and neither experience has left us in dissapointment.  I've tried the angus beef, the turkey burger, and now the kobe beef, and no other burger i've had has been this meaty, juicy, and succulent.  Paired with the sweet potato fries, and it's one of the best meals i've had in my life.  The burgers are huge, and the servings of fries can feed 2, so if you wanna save your money for gambling or appetite for liquor, than share.    we also had the dessert burger, which was okay. It's just cool to look at. The doughnut and chocolate ganache were my favorite parts, but the fruit combined with it was a little tart for my liking.  But this place definitely earns 5 starts for the food, ambiance, and service. AMAZING.  The burgers come with your standard toppings (lettuce, tomatoes, a pickle spear). You get to choose what type of bun, the burgers themselves cost between 8-16 bucks, and toppings are extra.  GOogle the website for a more extensive menu (along with prices)",

    "text": "This will now be one of my standard stops when I'm in Vegas. Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, the shopping area that's technically part of Mandalay Place, but the restaurant is actually closer to the Luxor.  If you're going just for your basic hamburger, it may be overpriced, but this place is all about customization and outlandishness in building YOUR perfect burger.  This is how I built mine: - American kobe beef burger, medium rare - Ciabatta bun - Sauteed portobello mushrooms - Seared foie gras + side of onion rings  Are you sitting down? My burger easily cost $35, and it was worth every penny. And I would gladly pay it again. Just know that it's very likely your burger won't be that expensive, and it will still be very good.  They didn't skimp on the foie gras, enough in fact for me to take a slice of it to enjoy separately.  The ciabatta was perfect for absorbing all the delicious juices and foie gras fat without disintegrating.  Man, I'm drooling just thinking about it again... if someone pointed a gun to my head and said, \"You must make love to a food item of your choice!\" this would be it. Rar!  Amenities wise, there are several TVs throughout (including one at your table)... we went on a Sunday, so we got our fill of NFL games.  There was quite a large bar and lots of booth seating.  This being Vegas, the servers were all attractive... not that I noticed, since they still didn't hold a candle to my burger.   Did I mention that it was pretty good?",

I met my husband here for lunch since he was attending a conference at Mandalay Bay.  I got there a bit early to secure a table during what was a very busy lunch crowd!  I only had to wait about 20 minutes which wasn't bad at all, but I did get there before noon so I think that helped.  I ordered the Pepperjack Cheese shots to start, which were little fried balls of spicy cheese yumminess.  We had dinner reservations at a steakhouse later that evening, so we both veered away from the typical burger menu... my husband had the lamb burger which was delicious if you are a lamb lover.  Very flavorful.  I had the grilled chicken sandwich (yeah I know, I know, but I just couldn't stomach anymore beef) and it was surprisingly juicy and delicious!  You can select your own toppings (although you pay for everything besides lettuce, tomato, and onion) so I chose sauteed spinach and truffle mayonnaise.  Oh the mayo... I wanted to lick the cup it was so good.  Fat fries with spicy ketchup completed the meal.  For dessert we split a milkshake with peanut butter, chocolate, and Baileys... very rich and delicious.  All in all, we really enjoyed our meal and our server was great too.  We would definitely go back to Burger Bar!",

Her burger melted in my mouth and made my burger just a mediocre hamburger. THANKS SHERRI!! :p   But either way, the food was great.

I usually go for the buffalo, always medium rare and always right on target.

I tracked one of these ales down in England and found a way to get it to me here in Cali.  If you are in vegas or staying at Luxor or Mandalay Bay, give it a shot for lunch.  btw...the seating at the bar is first come, first served, so if the wait for a table is too long, just hover around the bar and see who is finishing up.  as they say, God helps those who help themselves.  ;0)",

We waited 15 minuted for a table (not that big a deal) , however after we were seated it took 10 minutes for a waiter to wander over and take our order. We actually have to stop him from running off so we could order our sides. In his haste to get away from doing pretty much anything, he managed to get a couple of orders worng, but our group of friends are pretty laid back about it and didn't bother to mention it. It literally took 35 minutes for our food to get the the table and by then it had apparently been sitting because the fries were cold and the burgers lukewarm.  The food itself was OK but forgettable with the exception of the Mint chocolate milkshake one of the group ordered, that was excellent.  None of us were ever offered refills on our drinks, not even the guy drinking water, of course the waiter woud have had to come to the table to do that. Once the food was delivered we only saw him again when he dropped off the bill.  I may try this place again, as I'm hoping I caught them on an off day, but reading the other reviews, it probably won't be anytime soon.",

I'm totally going back and ordering that shit next time! Great beer selection, I think the Dogfish Head IPA would go well with the Kobe. Oh and you gotta try the zucchini fries, this is a must.

You can hang out in the middle of the mall and people watch until your buzzer goes off. The place feels kind of cramped once you're in there. At least it did for us. We were in a table in the middle, between the bar and some booths, but who's complaining? It's Vegas, and if you don't like crowds it sucks to be you.  A quick pitcher of beer set the dinner off right and we followed it up with a couple burgers (it IS the Burger Bar) that were cooked exactly the way we ordered them. My wife likes hers medium and I'm a burnt to a crisp kind of guy, which usually means one of us gets hosed. But not this time!  The shakes were awesome, too!",

    "text": "After a couple of buffets, our plans of a \"nice\" dinner were slowly dwindling away, so in the late afternoon/early evening on our last night in town, while the rest of the guys were breaking in my friends PS3 that they just gave him, I hopped on my friend's computer and checked out places that we could possibly go. A dinner at a high end fancy restaurant would have had slim chances since it would have been such last minute, plus I was getting the feeling the guys wanted a chill dinner. Trying to compromise, I hit the \"$\" and \"$$\" signs in my search.  One of the things that popped up was this place.  Personally for me, I absolutely love burgers, so I know I would have loved it.  And while it's no Fleur De Lys, I thought \"how can you go wrong with a restaurant by Hubert Keller?\"  I skimmed a couple of reviews and made the suggestion to the guys.  They all seemed to like the idea. The listing said they take reservations, however I believe the listing is wrong on that because when I called, the hostess said they did not take reservations, but would happily put our name down when we were going to head in.  It was still a little early, so I called back about 30 minutes later to put my name in, however we took a little long getting over to Mandalay Bay from the Wynn, and they had apparently already called my name.  Not to worry, she bumped us back up, gave me a buzzer, and said it would still be about 20 minutes since we did have a party of 11.  We finally sat down and overall, the decor and ambience of this places feels like Daily Grill meets a sports bar.  The booths on the right were had dark wood high backs, yet while the dark wood bar still resembled something out of a Western movie saloon, they had several televisions all along the back wall.  It was fully stocked as well.  They took a page from Barney's Beanery and each booth had it's own television.  Down the middle were a series of tables and our table was set up near the back, closet to the kitchen.  Our server Renee, was really cool and cute too.  She looked a little bit like a cheerleader right out of high school, with her hair in pigtails and her bright yet borderline smile, she was actually really nice and took good care of us.  And no, I don't mean in \"that\" way.  Pervs....  The menu is simple: burgers and burgers.  On the left, they had some preset burgers, which I'm sure were meticulously decided upon by Chef Keller.  There was one burger called the \"Rossini Burger\" and it was a burger consisting of American Kobe beef, seared foie gras, and black truffles.  While it sounded AWESOME, I was not ready to fork up $60 for a burger.  I was almost going to suggest we get that as a table and split the cost.  But to no avail.  The other side of the menu consists of building your own burger.  The concept is not new with places like The Counter, 5 Guys Burgers and Fries, and a few other places, but Hubert Keller included the typical add ons such as avocado, caramelized onions, aioli, and various cheeses, but he brings in a variety of gourmet items such as foie gras ($12), black truffles ($30 for 1/3 oz), Portobello mushrooms, and sauces such as a red wine and shallot reduction.  You start with your meat.  You have a choice of chuck, angus, American Kobe, buffalo and turkey.  The basic burger will run about $9-11 or $17 for the Kobe and is topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and a pickle wedge.  Then there are the add-ons.  Everything were of various prices, but quite reasonable and expected.  Cheeses were $.70, condiments ranged from $1 to $1.50, an avocado was about $2.50?  In all, you had a choice of I would say at least 2 dozen items.  Of course the gourmet items (as listed above) were more expensive.  I got the angus with both Monterey jack and provolone cheese, caramelized onions, aioli (should've gotten the chipotle aioli) and proscuitto.  You have a choice of plain, sesame, wheat, or ciabatta (I think there was one more?) as your bun.  I decided to just play it safe and go with a plain bun.  Most of the reviews I had read and raved about the sweet potato fries, and for $2.85, you can order an individual portion as your side.  Our food came out and the burger looked and smelled delicious. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/Cni2l-VKG_pdospJ6xliXQ?select=JfESKNrcArdV3QRIaYq_oA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/Cni2...</a>  I couldn't really tell between my 2 cheeses, but oh well.  The meat was well seasoned and while it wasn't a perfect combination of flavors, I really liked all of my toppings.  The sweet potato fries were nice and crispy but not overcooked, so I really liked that.  Overall, I think everybody liked it.  I've heard small things here and there that they didn't like, but I consider it a successful meal.  They apparently also have build your own milkshakes, but I think that would have absolutely sent me over the top.  I definitely know where I'm coming to get a good burger next time I'm in Vegas.",

Cost to worth it rating: 3 (burgers start ~$10, specialty burgers are more) Return worthiness: yes (I go at least once each Vegas trip)  Highlights: - Peppercorn burger: yummy rich sauce from Fluer de Lys recipe served on the side so you can pour to your liking. I added blue cheese crumbles to take it over the top. As a pepper fiend, I actually could've used a bit more pepper on the actual burger. :-o - Ranchers meat (or something like that): as the second level up, it's definitely worth the $1 upgrade. The hub got the standard and I could tell the difference in pure meat flavor as well and juiciness. - Seasoned bacon: peppered and jalapeno are options  - Jalapeno fried pickles: couldn't taste the spice so much but they were great and  like that they were spears - Make your own: array of toppings including regular things like a selection of cheese to not so mainstream like fried egg and pickled beets   - Open late: weekends til 2am - Sweet potato fries: thin, crispy - Veev acai spirit lemonade: not too sweet, interesting dynamic with antioxidants in an alcoholic beverage--wonder if they cancel each other out ;-) - Personal tv in booths: great for sports days  - Milkshakes: come all sundae style pretty with the hugest straws ever, also come in alcoholic versions which is great for sin city   Lowlights: - TV options: wish could switch channel and they had the direct ticket  Love this place and remains my casual Vegas staple so I'll be back.",

    "text": "This was our last meal in Vegas before hopping on a plane and getting back to reality.  Knowing that Burger Bar is a Hubert Keller restaurant, I went in expecting a lot...maybe expecting too much.  You basically build your own burger here.  There are so many choices.  You get to pick your meat, bun and your toppings.  I went with the Black  Angus Beef Burger with bacon, grilled onions, sprouts and bleu cheese( <a href=\"http://static1.px.yelp.com/bphoto/DUT55eQDtMPNZgyjN_JvKg/l\">static1.px.yelp.com/bpho...</a> ).  I swear the restaurant wasn't very busy, but the food took for-e-ver to come out, and we were huuuungry!  After watching food pass us by to other tables, our food finally came.  For a $14 burger(after all my toppings), I was expecting to have a super orgasmic experience when biting into my burger.  The burger was good, but definitely not the best burger I've ever had.  The meat was nice and juicy, but  the flavor didn't wow me.    Again, service was sloooooow.  We were done with our meal, and we wanted to pay our bill so we could head to the airport.  Our waitress was nowhere to be found.  We finally get our bill and want to pay it, but again, the waitress disappeared.  Maybe I was just more irritable because I was tired and hungover.  But it seriously seemed like we waited forever.  Will I come back again?  Maybe.......they do have a Kobe beef burger...hmmm.",

We shared a half Caesar Salad (the menu didn't offer half-portions, but our server let us know). It was pretty boring, but after a weekend of carbs and meat, we were pretty excited about a bit of lettuce.   For the burger, we shared an Angus Burger ($9.50) on a Sesame Bun with Pepper Jack Cheese ($.95), Caramelized Onion ($.95), and Jalapeno Bacon ($1.55).  They had so many toppings it was very hard to decide (and easy to wind up with a $17 burger if you weren't careful!)  The bacon was awesome and we loved the onions. They had some chef special burgers that came with skinny fries, but ours was just the burger, so we added an order of Zucchini Fries.    For dessert (and the bit that threw me from 3-stars to 4) was the Sweet Cheesecake Burger. It was a glazed donut sliced in half like a hamburger bun (so cute!) with a cheesecake 'burger' and toppings of strawberries and pineapple. It was so awesome and I was so sad that I had already promised half of it to Mr R.    Overall, it was a good lunch spot and a great burger.",

I have some major respect for Hubert Keller and he is my favorite chef. Anyway back to the review.   First of all, I would like to explain how this place was a major up for me when we first came here because it was still open at like 12? My friends went to the Ice lounge so it was perfect to come here after the lounge. We were all hungry and this place was the only place in the mall that was still open and that was exactly why we went to this restaurant. So that was already a good start.  I really like the place a lot to be honest. There were so many different kind of burger to get. It was like Burger Heaven to me hahaha. You could either get a fixed selection of burger OR you can make your own burger with whatever topping you want in the inside. There were many pre-fixed burger that I want to get but dude...a burger with whatever you want is like a damn dream come True to me. :) SO OF COURSE I picked the \"Make your own burger.\" ALTHOUGH i did wanted to try that one burger with lobster or the Hubert Keller burger but regardless I didnt regret it one bit.  SO there were 4 different kind of meat you can get with the \"make your own burger.\" There is the regular, buffalo, kobe, and one other kind that i forgot. It was a week ago. ANYWAY i got the regular patty with bacon, avocado, spinach, portebello mushrooms, grill onions, and i think thats it...? I'm not sure hahaha i got too much toppings. ANYWAY the burget came and the burger was huge. It was like my dream come True burger :) It was so hard to bite through it bit by bit but it was so tasty bite after bite. OH MAN. I love the burger that i got. It was so delicious.   I tried my friend's burger which was legit as well. HE got the kobe patty with bacon, avocado, FRIED EGG, grill onions and some other stuff. I took a bite of it and i was also in love with it. :) There so many different kind of toppings you can get that its just so awesomeeee! I think my rating went kinda down when i saw and taste my friend's sliders. It was so plain and doesnt look that appetizing. It was anything special just 3 sliders with 3 different kind of patty. I tried it and the taste was not special and it was not the right match as i would say. The fries was pretty good.   I don't know but I wouldn't mind coming back here to make my dream burger again. hehehe :)",

The place is located a little ways inside the Mandalay Place, which is their shopping/mall area. Seriously, I didn't know MB had a mall area. Good to know. I arrive fashionably late and our party of six are already seated at a booth. Inside the booth is a TV turned on to the Lakers game.  We started out with some cocktails while we continue to look over the menu. The drinks were typical... Nothing too spectacular. The burgers on the other hand had an extensive menu with almost everything and anything you could possibly want to add on.  I ended up choosing the Kobe Beef Burger, medium rare, on ciabatta bread with bacon, grilled onions, cheddar cheese, and sliced avocados. Unfortunately, fries do not come with your burger so I ordered some to try out. Overall, the burger was pretty big and tasty. I'm not sure if the $16 price tag on the Kobe Beef burger was better than the regular $8 beef.  Next time I'd definitely try the regular Ridgefield Farm/Black Angus beef. But then again, I probably wouldn't come eat here unless someone else wanted to go. It was good, but not 'OMG THIS IS THE BEST BURGER EVER' kind of place.  I included a pic of my burger. Enjoy!   P.S. Dont forget to flirt with the minus5 girls on the way to and from the Burger Bar!",

I am not a big meat eater but I had to see what the rave was about.  we arrived around 7 and for a table of 10 we did not have to wait very long.  It was a Wednesday though so I'm sure that made a difference.  The service was great, not easy with such a big party.  The waitress introduced me to the red velvet vodka! wow that was delicious!",

    "text": "Located in Mandalay Place, Herbert Keller's Burger Bar is an upscale bar that carries gourmet burgers, shakes and bar drinks.  Although they have a variety of burgers to choose from, I ordered the build your own burger. You get to choose the protein, bread type for bun and fillings. Dill pickle, tomatoes, lettuce, onions are the complementary fillings. Additional gourmet fillings are abundant and are an extra charge which can be from .95 cents to $5.00 depending on what you choose.  I had the Kobe Beef Patty- Medium ($17.25) on Ciabatta Bread with a side of Truffle Mayo (+.95 cents) which I put on my bread and ate with my side order of skinny fries which comes in a cup (enough for me and my boyfriend). I washed it down with an iced tea.  My burger was juicy, tender (not as fatty as I imagined) but had really great flavor. With a light spread of truffle mayo it was sooooo good. However, I preferred dipping my fries in the truffle mayo, the mayo had bits of black truffle in it that wasn't too overpowering.  Service was great and I was lucky to score a table right at 11am when they opened but it got busy as the day wore on. Closes at 11pm which is nice.",

Maybe some of the worst money I've ever spent. The burgers were just ok, nothing spectacular. My boyfriend's Kobe Beef burger had chunks of tendons or something in it. The bartenders were attentive but not personable.   I wouldn't return, or suggest this place to anyone.   BLT Burger was so much better, just a few hotels down the strip.",

    "text": "Any place that I visit four times in the course of one weekend, especially in Vegas where there are SO MANY options, I feel obligated to give five stars.  Especially because on the fourth visit one of the kitchen staff waved at me.  Apparently I became a \"regular\" real quick.  1) my first stop after being picked up at the airport by Vegas yelper Myke, five of us decide to have lunch at the burger bar.  I ordered a MR burger with pineapple, grilled onions, Swiss and prosciutto.  Ill tell you what though...that decision took almost an hour.  SO MANY OPTIONS.  I was disappointed none of us opted for the $60 burger which consisted of half a lobster, shrimp, and some other expensive goodies.  You can add truffles to your burger as well and up the price, but I guess we figured since this was our first stop of a long weekend, we should be somewhat frugal.  Kobe beef was not an option for me...but it was definitely an option on the menu.  Also I had a delicious mimosa which was my first drink in 2 weeks, so it went down into my belly which was ready to welcome it with open arms.  2) Same day....other people show up to Vegas and THEY get hungry.  Now, I wasn't in the mood for another burger one hour later, but i did order my favorite beer Blue Moon.  That selection was a lot quicker than the burger, but their beer list is super extensive.  It was the best selection I found all weekend, and had i not been craving a Blue Moon, I could have stared at that list for an hour too.    3) Still the same day...That night, I am in need of some serious food, seeing as though all i had eaten all day was the burger in the AM.  So three of us, before heading out to the club, went and ordered the fries, sweet potato fries and the zucchini sticks.  A perfect little inexpensive snack to coat my tummy with the grease it needed.  4) Saturday night, my roommates were looking for the perfect IPA.  With the extensive beer collection, they found it.  I had a corona.  Thanks again for lunch Myke.",

    "text": "I would consider this place a high end burger place. It's basically burgers, fries, and salads (4 total) on the menu.  They have the usual \"build your own\" burger option (meat, cheese, bun, toppings, sides) or their own specials. This time around I chose the American Classic for $12.75: Ridge field beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun and I added mushrooms. I chose the regular fries.   The burger itself wasn't too bad, a bit dry, but good quality moo. The fries were nicely crisp and soft at the same time. Mmmm, good food. It also looks like they make milkshakes like how they did back in the day. Metal cup/whole milk/Hershey's chocolate syrup....oh yeah. I need a cigarette. Oh, this part of the casino/resort, you're not allowed to light up.  Considering the X games were happening, my dinner companions and I were talking about Pierre (forgot his last name) about doing Moto-Cross and Skateboarding. One of the really pretty waitress' (that one of my dinner companions were looking at since we sat at the bar), said, \"Oh yeah, he does both.\" To which I was waiting for my friend to say something. I guess he didn't hear her. So, when she came back, I asked her how she knew. She responded with. \"I'm a big extreme sports fan.\" This time, both my dinner companions looked (both confused and WTF, why is she talking to us? faces)...to which she quickly turns around and goes off to do other things. D'oh!   Maybe next time I'll try a more expensive burger and my friend who's interested, will actually SAY SOMETHING to her instead of making her feel dumb. :) Hee.",

Anyway, the very friendliest of staff, the craziest of burger building options, the endless amount of beer selections, and then the milkshakes!!!!  First off, I started by building my own burger. Kobe beef, pretzel bun, bacon, cheddar and bleu cheese, caramelized onions, and a shallot reduction.... (I know, right?!) Then I got the skinny fries.  The waitress suggested the truffle mayo. I will not suggest it, I demand that if you go here, YOU GET IT!  OMG, I could've eaten that with a spoon. Ok, ok....you get the point. I also had a, build my own \"alcoholic\" shake. The guy that owns this place is a genius! Chocolate ice cream, bananas, peanut butter sauce, frangelica, Malibu banana. What The \"F\"!??!!  They had their own little room in the middle of the restaurant just for building ice cream. I will be going back tomorrow for lunch.",

    "text": "Burger Bar is a small burger chain by French chef Hubert Keller.  This place is basically a higher scale build-your-own burger restaurant where just about every ingredient costs some extra money.  What you see here is the Australian wagyu beef patty with swiss cheese and fois gras on top.  Yep, a fat piece of fois gras on top.  The burger was cooked medium and was very juicy.  In fact, it was soaking juicy which caused the bun to to be way too wet.  The fois gras by itself tasted creamy but was hardly seasoned.  When paired with the wagyu burger, it absolutely did not mix at all.  It was like eating a big piece of fat.    All in all, I thought it was just an OK burger joint due to the price, but it's definitely a decent lunch spot if you're in Las Vegas.",

One of my fav things about this spot is their great beer list. It's not crazy awesome, but it's pretty darn good. And you can create your own sampler of the different beers too. I'm also a fan of the trio of fries. Fair warning: It's an insane amount of fries - don't attempt to eat it on your own. You can get to pick 3 different types of fries (or rings). I really like the fat fries and sweet potato fries. And then you can pair that trio fries with a sampler of dipping sauces. Oh my! I do love me some dipping sauces, so I'm a total fan of this sampler. Every single sauce I've tried so far has been great. And then there's the adult milkshakes, beer floats, etc., etc. There's definitely a LOT more to the Burger Bar than just burgers.",

As an appetizer I ordered the pepper jack cheese shots.   The spicy lamb burger that I ordered was very dry and bland. The lamb tasted funny and it wasn't spicy at all. The sweet potatoes fries were mediocre, however, the pepper jack cheese shots were decent.  I had higher expectations for this restaurant. This place is more about quantity than quality, so the food is below par in my opinion. Our service kept refilling our drinks and asked if we needed anything, so service was good but not impeccable.

But that doesn't mean it wasn't a good burger.   First off. They don't take reservations. This place is PACKED, so call ahead and get on the waiting list, or be prepared to wait 30-60 minutes for dinner. For a Vegas restaurant, I was a bit surprised at how small it is. We called when we were heading over there though, and ended up only having to wait less than 10 minutes.  I do love the fact that you can build your own burger and they have a lot of options. They have a few burger options on the menu too. I built my own burger with Black Angus beef, bleu cheese, caramelized onions, peppered bacon and chipotle aioli on a cibatta bun. It was a tasty burger. But it wasn't out of this world amazing. The prices are a bit high, but you do get a gigantic 1/2 pound burger. I couldn't even finish it. Fries are extra though, and were really not that impressive.   I enjoyed the little tv's at each booth, and there was a great beer selection. I don't see this as a must in Vegas, but if you enjoy burgers, you'd enjoy the Burger Bar.",

My burger was so sloppy it was falling apart before the waiter had it at my table.  I guess for it being an upscale slightly pricey burger place I expected my burger to be fully assembled and not lackluster in taste.  My friends Bison burger was so much better than mine,but both of our fries came out cold.  The server dropped the food but we did not see him again until he asked if we wanted refills and left the check.   Save your money, this place is overrated",

    "text": "I made sure this was on my list of places to try based on the sage advice of Brad E.  I had walked by the place many times in my travels to Vegas and had glanced at the menu board and decided $10-20 hamburgers were not my style.  I got there early for the dinner hour and got a seated at a small table right away, being alone they tried to talk me into sitting at the bar without being pushy.  By the time I left folks were waiting to be seated.    I opted for the sustainable beef (medium) on Ciabatta with blue cheese and a spicy aoili ($12.35) .  It came with a tiny slice of onion, a tiny slice of tomato, a pickle spear and a slice of lettuce (see picture).  I also got a side salad ($2.50).  It was a good, but not great, burger.  For me it didn't live up to the hype.  I have had burgers that tasted just as good from Red Robin for less.  I seemed to arrive as shifts were changing, my original waitress was by quite often but towards the end I had a waitress that was working another part of the restaurant and I only saw her when she came to check on me.  It didn't really matter much as either way I got good service and was never totally neglected.  I would come back again if somebody I was with wanted to but not likely by myself.",

    "text": "Do not let the hype scare you, you can get a great burger at the Burger Bar without spending more than $15. (or indulge yourself to an exclusive $60 burger!)  The Burger Bar is located right where the Mandalay Bay shops meet the Luxor. You get a lot of really unique choices of burgers but the real highlight of the Burger Bar is that you can completely customize your burger any way you like.  You can choose from different types of beef (including Angus, Kobe and my favorite Buffalo) as well as salmon and chicken and a huge variety of additional toppings.  The standard burger includes a choice of beef Kobe and Buffalo being the most expensive and succulent) along with lettuce, tomato, onion and dill pickle and your choice of bun (more than 7 choices if memory serves me correctly).  While the huge variety of toppings is tempting, keep in mind that you actually need to eat the burger and an additional 6 toppings will make a beef skyscraper that will require knife and fork to dispatch (not that there's anything wrong with that).  The burger is always cooked to perfection, I have tried both medium rare (my favorite) and medium and every time they were juicy, succulent and flavorful.  Their onion rings deserve a special mention, they are crisp and fried to perfection and you can still taste the actual onion inside them.  The Burger Bar also offers some generous milkshakes. My personal favorite is the caramel latte which also comes with 2 Graham crackers. Believe me, I work hard so I eat a lot and it's often difficult to finish  big burger and the milkshake...  The staff is friendly and attentive.   On the negative side, the booths are just a bit cramped and the music is too loud for my senile worldview. Also depending on day and time there might be up to 30 minutes of waiting but that is expected for a restaurant on the Strip during rush hour.  Overall, the Burger Bar is an excellent place on the Strip to eat a juicy satisfying burger, made to your exact specifications without putting a huge dent on your wallet.",

Wanted to sample several things so ordered some appetizers.  Here's the bottom line: The fat fries were OK but nothing special. Typical bar fare fries. I would expect fries in a place like this to be hot and crispy, not limp and mushy.  The Chicken Wings are the same chicken wings you get in almost any bar anywhere, covered in off-the-grocery-store-shelf Louisiana Hot Sauce. Nothing special at all. Very average.  Perhaps the most disappointing were the Sliders...  First, for $6.95, they only give you 2 instead of the standard 3. More importantly, if I go to a place promoting  itself as a superior, signature burger restaurant, I would expect the burgers to be extra-ordinary.   Not only were they perfectly ordinary but they were the smallest sliders I think I've ever seen, about the diameter of a silver dollar. They were bland and dry, no flavor. I don't even think they were seasoned with salt and pepper. They came with cheese and a pickle slice. The cheese looked like the cheese that comes individually wrapped in plastic, not even melted.",

Since my sister had eaten here before, & said it was good, I trusted her judgement. The wait was not long & 5 minutes under the 15 minute wait time given. The Hostesses were very nice & polite. I could care less for our waitress, as she was young and not too eager to help out with the menu selections.   Our food however was delicious!! We both ordered custom beef burgers on a pretzel bun, cheddar cheese, bacon n onions with sweet potato fries. Juicy meat, cooked to order as a True medium, soft bun, fresh toppings and bacon was crisp along the the fries!! The sweet potato fries were a little too sweet for me, so next time, I will order the fat fries instead.   We ordered shakes to go with our meals, they did not disappoint!! I had the adult Vanilla French Kiss shake made with coffee liquor, while my sis opted for the Salted Caramel shake. Both creamy, delicious & not too overly sweet!!  We were seated at a booth with our own personal TV which was great, since the Charger vs. Broncos football game was on!!  I would definitely come back to Burger Bar!!",

The booth we were seated at had a small TV in the wall where we could watch the game.   Food is reasonably priced for a burger joint in Vegas. I ordered the Angus beef burger from the build your own menu (~$10) with the Onion bun, American cheese and their Burger Bar Spicy Ketchup. The food wait was slightly longer than expected.",

I'm leaving a review because after talking to a manager, they took care of everything and made a fresh burger.  I went with the classic American.  And they bought our drinks for the mess up which I reiterated was unnecessary but greatly appreciated!  The booths are big and spacious and all have their own TV!  Great for playoff football!

They have such a great selection to choose from, lots of toppings and options for people who choose not to eat beef too. We did not get a chance to try their epic bloodymary, which we hope to do the next time we visit Las Vegas. The chef's skewer on that looked awesome. Hopefully, the next time.",

Instead of lining up against the wall and waiting like a bunch of common criminals, we walked around the casino, did other stuff, and checked back about 20 minutes later.   The hostess said she'd already called our name and that she'd call it again later when a table opened up.   Fair enough -- it was our fault for wandering off. She called another name \"party of [same amount of people we are],\" again, again; obviously this mystery party of 4 was not around.   I said \"we could take the place of the  people you're calling, you know.\" To her credit, she got it and seated us in one of the several empty booths (so, is anticipation part of the dining experience or is there some seating system whose logic eludes me to this day?).  The food was excellent. I'd caught the chef's (not that I expect that he personally made our order) show on PBS (that's how hard I party) and it lived up to expectations. Our waitress was nice and friendly.   If  you're at Mandalay Bay and want to have a gourmet burger, this is what I'd recommend.",

But because this place is one of my favorite burger places (and I don't live in Vegas) there is a huge wait just to be seated. Your best bet is to find a spot at the bar to order your food and such. Oh, and make sure you know that it'll cost you about $25+ per person. I was tempted to get the $60 burger but I think I'll wait till it's my birthday to try that one out. Also, the sweet potato fries are awesome. If you don't like their sweet potato fries, there's something wrong with you.  Here's how this place breaks down on my top ten burger list: 1. Burger Bar, Las Vegas (NV) 2. Healthy Junk, Anaheim (CA) 3. GBurger, La Habra (CA) 4. Left Coast Artisan Burgers, Seoul (KR) 5. Abbey's Burger Bistro, Baltimore (MD) 6.

The service was pretty rotten.  It took almost 45 minutes to get our food and the restaurant wasn't that crowded.  I kept asking the waiter how we were looking and he said a few times that my burger was going right up.  Well, it wasn't.  The people sitting next to me sent their food back to the kitchen.  It looked like the burger was way undercooked.  Lucky for me that I didn't have that problem.  A fine place for a burger but far from outstanding.",

Because I had previously eaten at Huber Keller's flagship restaurant Fleur  in San Francisco, my expectations were really high.     That place is fabulous.    Here, well its a burger bar and not the best of burger bars.  The restaurant is very noisy.   I know that is the fashion for gastro pub type places, but for us, it was hard to talk.   The burgers and toppings were terrific.  I liked the reduction sauce that came with my burger.    The service was terrific too.    But the buns were ordinary.  The french fries were good, as good as McDonalds, but not great, and the onion rings were disappointing -- maybe frozen, i don't know.  Father's Office in West LA, or the Back Abbey or Eureka in my hometown of Claremont CA get everything right, the burger the bun, the sides -- Burger Bar has a ways to go to match the best of this genre.",

With that being said, Burger Bar is a fun experience when you're in Vegas. It's in the midst of the hotel/shopping area, so if you're going for a quick bite this is kind of inconvenient. Make an attraction out of it, visit the hotel and go shopping so parking & walking here is worth it.  The table backs are high for privacy, so the next table won't see how big of a slob you are when the waitress brings your 10 ton burger and you drip 5 tons of it onto your lap.  Totally customizable, if you're not gonna drink alcohol then try one of their shakes (maybe with alcohol IN it? just a thought. hey its Vegas!) and their side items.

    "text": "I believe there's only one in Vegas and how befitting for such a great sit-down burger joint! I wouldn't call myself a burger kind of person but I do consider myself a man of great taste. And flavor! Mmm :9  \"I stay Gucci down to the socks!\" (c) Christopher Wallace.   I live by a motto of never believing in something because of the hype. Not that I'm too good to give a little attention to pop culture, but just because I go in it to find out for myself and walking into Burger Bar with that same exact mentality. I almost ALWAYS, ALWAYS call a restaurant when I'm on my way to let them know that I will be paying them a visit. I give them my name, ask if it's busy, and the amount of time it will take for me to go from \"here\" to \"there\" so they can expect me. And that is exactly what I did:  \"Hi, my name's Aljamin. What time do you guys close? ...Late? Awesome! I'll need a seat... no... just me. Great! What was your name again? Awesome, Joel! I'll be there in about 15 minutes. Thanks again!\"  99.9% of the time, my table is already set. And that it was! +1 for Joel at Burger Bar! Excellent customer service and superb follow through. The menu is EXCELLENT! I browsed through it and a bunch of stuff made me \"oo! and ahh!\" First thing I noticed was the most expensive burger on the menu: Kobe burger with foie gras (duck liver), black truffles, caramelized onions?! Mmmm.... I couldn't afford it at the time, but hear me Kobe burger! YOU WILL BE CONQUERED! Haha!  If you know what a salad bar is, you get the idea of what Burger Bar is like. You pick your meat, your bun, your toppings, and a side. I went with the Kobe beef, Swiss cheese, on a wheat bun with caramelized onions (lettuce and tomato come with it), and a succulent red wine reduction sauce on the side. Order you some sweet potato fries and you're set! Once you destroy the burger, get the Nutella shake for dessert! Magnific!  I would definitely come here again and create my next masterpiece!",

We did a full circle around the entirety of Mandalay before finding it in the hallway where it is tucked away.   Great burgers! I was skeptical, but pleased. I had the Angus and husband had the Wagyu. He couldn't stop raving about it! I had a bite and wasn't that impressed (my burger was incredible as well). Definitely a matter of personal preference. He said it was worth the extra bucks, while I wouldn't have cared.   Will definitely keep this place in mind for our next trip.",

The fries were so good with aaforementioned ketchup that I neglected my burger.  Also had their poppers and with the ketchup - awesome.

    "text": "With so few choices for vegans in Vegas, especially in an \"Ive got beer munchies big time and I want to eat now\" type of situation, the Burger Bar is a sufficient choice. Deemed the Vegas Vegan burger ... how clever, their vegan selection includes a nicely toasted bun, a huge portabello mushroom cap, fancy greens, tomato and a laundry list of exotic and standard sides you may add on, some at an additional charge of course.  I was thoroughly satisfied with my choice of toppings, all of which I cannot remember now due to mass beer consumption.  I do remember ordering a pitcher of their Oktoberfest, which was tasty yet way too heavy to be drinking with burgers (vegan and regular) and fries. Luckily, its Vegas! So we got ourselves a couple of to-go beer cups and went happily on our way. Our pockets a bit lighter, but not by much.  The selection of beers here is impeccable, mostly bottled, but many on tap as well. I dont think that I would return for the vegan burger, but I would definitely come back for the beer.",

I realized we had missed our check out time! My head dizzy and my stomach queasy, my boy and I quickly packed our bags and headed out the door. After a discrete snooze at a bar, I woke up knowing I should eat (but not really wanting to). We headed towards the Mandalay Bay looking for food. Nothing sounded better than the Burger Bar, why? The hangover burger! I know it may sound kinda odd, but it was what the doctor ordered. I was able to share the burger with my boy and make it safely on to the plane a couple of hours later :)! Highly recommend it if you hit the town hard the night before!",

    "text": "After agonizing over my restaurant choice for my last dinner in Vegas before an early morning flight, I settled on Burger Bar. I had the pleasure of dining in upscale restaurants the entire week, and was looking for something more relaxed. Since, my ingredient standards are high, it couldn't be just any old burger place... When I saw they had a Waygu beef burger on the menu, I knew that was exactly what I wanted for dinner! I ordered it \"build your own burger\" style and added smoked Gouda and truffle mayo. I'm not usually one to go for mayonnaise, but the server highly recommend it as it is one of their house made specialties. Soooo, when in Vegas... I also added a small organic greens salad, which was lightly and perfectly dressed with a tasty, subtle vinaigrette. The burger was cooked to perfection, and practically melted in my mouth. The Truffle Mayo was an excellent complement! Rounding out the meal was a small side of skinny fries. Just like the Mayo, fries are not something I usually eat, so if I order them they have to be darn good for me to bother with the calories! They did not disappoint. I had the fries with their spicy ketchup which was a great choice! It tasted like it had a jalapeno infusion. I decided to go for one of their signature milkshakes for dessert, since I was on a serious splurge. This is where my review went from 5 stars to 4. I ordered the Nutella milkshake, which is chocolate ice cream blended with Nutella, topped with homemade chocolate whipped cream and crushed hazelnuts. The flavor of the shake itself was good. Where it fell short was: it was missing the hazelnuts (no one stopped back to check on me & fix it), and nearly half of what was in the glass was whipped cream topping, as opposed to actual milkshake. If I'm going to spend $10 on a milkshake, it better be a milkshake not whipped cream. The service was good; the server did a great job helping me pair toppings to complement my burger selection. I will definitely go back again, I will just look for dessert elsewhere.",

    "text": "Is it cliche to give this place 5 stars??? I don't care! I would agree, this is probably among the best burger places in the city.....Yes, the prices are more than what you would pay at Apple-bee's and/or In-n-Out.... but OBVIOUSLYYYY this is a much more quality burger and you do get what you pay for.   For my experience:  I sat at the bar. I didn't plan on it, but there was no wait.. and I was hungry! Overall I highly recommend sitting at the bar, there are plenty of bartenders, they are attentive and right there when you need them. If I were to be sitting in the restaurant, I would prefer to be in a booth because the tables seem like you would always feel in the way.   For our eats we STARTED (which was a mistake) with the Nutella shake. I will dream about this delicious thing for the rest of my life. Something this tasty shouldn't be allowed to exist. If you love Nutella, you will fall in love with this incredibly easily. Its topped with fresh cocoa whipped cream, hazelnuts, and chocolate chips! I will drink this down before I die.  Burgers: I really wanted the buffalo burger(which they serve here) because I love buffalo and its better alternatives to beef. But, I stuck with turkey. Turkey burger with provolone and guacamole on a ciabatta bun. This baby was steamin when it came out. Fresh off the grill. I really appreciated the guacamole they had here, fresh and yummy, and its obviously not for dipping chips in, and they understand that. It is for spreading and the consistency of it was beautiful for spreading! All the burgers come with lettuce, tomato, and purple onion on the side... and a pickle spear:]   My friend got a burger as well, and she also got the zucchini fries, PIPING HOT also. These were good, and a good change from fries.   Sadly, I couldn't finish my burger because of the delicious Nutella shake. I will definitely be back here for my indulgence and gluttony, but next time I will fast and make sure Burger Bar is the only thing to be in my stomach that day.",

If it's not the best burger restaurant in Vegas, Burger Bar is in the top three places in town offering ground meat on a bun.  The restaurant's decor is simple -- think neighborhood bar tucked away in a casino.  But the menu is vast.  It's a high-market grocery store's collection of meat, vegetables, cheeses, sauce options.  Put simply: Burger Bar is [bleep]'n fantastic.  The cooks prepare the patty perfect to order (I'm a medium rare kind of girl).  I had my bison burger with blue cheese and cucumbers.  The cheese was appropriately pungent and tasty and the cucumbers were fresh and crispy.  And the whiskey milkshake I ordered was brilliant.

The price tag on the burgers is well warranted as i have yet to experience a burger that compares.  There is usually always a 15-20 minute wait during dinner time and if you are super hungry that can be annoying. For me, it has always been well worth the wait. Overall the staff is friendly enough, service is solid -- nothing exceptional but also nothing to complain about. The food, however, is what earns this place a five star rating. I have had several burgers off their menu and the Rossini, of course, tops them all -- but for more budget oriented people I'd recommend the Buffalo Burger or the Kobe beef burger.   I had the Buffalo burger with grilled onion and avocado along with zucchini fries on my most recent visit. It was good but i should have ordered it medium instead medium well. I think with Buffalo meat being lean and dry naturally it is best to order it a bit juicier. Kobe beef burger was simply amazing and I have no complaints about it. The skinny fries are okay, as are the sweet potato fries and zucchini fries...I don't know, I have never met a fry I didn't like..  I truly believe that you can't go wrong with anything on the menu at Burger Bar.",

I ordered Blue Moon on tap and boy on an empty stomach, it definitely went to my head quickly *smile*. I ordered the Hubert Keller burger $20 with sweet patoto fries and my hubby ordered an American Kobe beef burger $16 (not to be confused with the Rossini Kobe burger at $60 with truffles) with added choice of toppings + $4 and a side of onion rings.   As I waited, I noticed that the restaurant looked like a comfy burger joint, with booths and tables. The booths each had a mini flat screen so you can watch while you eat. There are two bar areas, for those who do not want to wait for a table. Take a seat at the bar if you are hungry and want to be served immediately.   My burger came in a foccaccia bread with loads of blue cheese. My first bite was great, a mouthful of cheese, tender meat and chewy bread. I tasted my hubby's burger and mine was definitely the winner. The hubby's Kobe burger had lots of hard bits in it and that was surprising, especially if its supposed to be a Kobe burger.  All in all a good experience but I still prefer the Perfect Burger at LBS at the Red Rock Casino. I want to say that I will come back here but even if my $20 Huber Keller burger is good, it's still does not beat out the Perfect burger.",

The burgers were so amazing I'd be willing to put up with bad service the next time I come to Las Vegas. The zucchini fries are a must. The fried mac and cheese was sinfully delicious!!!",

We had high expectation for the food!   I ordered the Black Angus Beef burger medium rare. The meat was very bland, and it was lack of seasoning. Bryan had the American Kobe Beef burger medium rare. But, the kobe beef was like the black angus beef which was lack of flavors. The meat didn't melt in the mouth. Nothing stood out and nothing special! My husband and I definitely had better kobe beef burger before. That was very disappointing.  For the sides, we had the buttermilk onion rings and BUTTERMILK ZUCCHINI FRIES. The onion rings were just fine. The batter was flavorful, but the crust was too thick for the skinny onion rings. On the other hand,  the zucchini fries had the same crust, but the crust was good on the zucchini. The zucchinis were cut thick, so they can hold up the crust well. It was a good combination. I like them.   My favorite is the NUTELLA MILKSHAKE! The shake was delicious! It was pack with hazelnut flavor, especially the nutella whipped cream. Every bite was nutella! Perfect for Nutella lover!   Overall, the food was just ok. I thought Hubert can do better, maybe his other fine dining restaurant would be better. For about $50 two person, Burger Bar doesn't worth the money in my opinion.",

A great array of gourmet burgers (customizable), fries (perfectly crispy regular and sweet potato fries), shakes, a great variety of tap/ bottled beer/ lager, a cool setting and finally \"hot\" servers!.  We arrived around 2 pm, yet the wait time was still a good 45 minutes. Luckily, we were able to find 2 seats in the bar (2 bar areas).    After settling down, I ordered the American Kobe burger-($16) w/ swiss-($.70) w/ a side of sweet potato fries-($2.85).  My bf ordered the American Classic (Ridgefield farm beef, American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion, on sesame bun served w/ fries-$14).    As far as taste, both burgers were great!  I could not really distinguish the two apart, in terms of meat quality.  I would probably just go for the American Classic next time, as both provided commensurate levels of satisfaction.   The fries were outstanding.  Both the regular and the sweet potato fries were absolutely light and crispy.     My bf enjoyed his Polygamy Porter beer.  We ordered a Heath bar/peanut butter chip ice cream shake. He got 2 sips and i finished the rest.  It was an awesomely delicious, gluttonous, all-American meal.  Now off to detox.",

On one hand, the flavor profile of the baguette burger was one of the tastiest I've ever had and the patty itself was absolutely perfect. On the other hand, there were so many ways in which the cooks could have made the concept shine but failed to execute.   The burger could have been the best I've ever had if the cooks didn't fumble the pass.   The bread was not toasted well and had a store bought quality to it. The burger/bun did not fit well together so eating was very messy. The arugula was not flavorful.  And the Brie chunk was too thick and didn't cover the burger either. The sweet potato fries were bland.   The whipped cream was delicious but the milkshake itself was not particularly thrilling.   The real low of the burger bar is the ambiance. Everything from the tables to the mismatched silverware to the fact that the booths are filled with TVs that the wait staff CANNOT TURN OFF make the burger bar feel like an airport restaurant. The staff were friendly, but seemed checked out to the point where I kept waiting for them to make a mistake.",

I didn't eat all day on our 9-hour drive to Vegas and was so looking forward to ordering a killer burger and adult milkshake. I didn't get that far.  We arrived shortly before 7pm on Friday night. It was packed. That was understandable. We were told it was about a 45 minute wait unless we wanted to sit at the bar. SURE! Let's sit at the bar. We were seated immediately and with a smile. Thanks!  We sit at the bar and was immediately addressed and we put in a drink order while looking at the menu. I had planned out burger after burger before I came here, but I decided to divert from my original ideas. I ordered a Kobe on an onion bun, with blue cheese, jalapeno bacon, caramelized onion, and a side of skinny fries. The wifey bought the American Classic.  Within a relatively short period of time our food came out...  well, her food came out and I was given a burger that was said to be mine. I looked at it and didn't see any bacon nor any sign of bleu cheese. I made mention of this, the bussboy didn't quite understand. I cut open the burger and inspected it: maybe Kobe beef with a ton of grill scrapings (these were \"grilled onions\"). The burger was sitting in the window for some time for it was lukewarm and the fries cold. I brought these issues to my server and he said \"Are you sure? Are you sure there isn't any bleu cheese under the burger or bacon under the onions?\" Really? You are kidding me: look at the damn burger. Bacon and bleu cheese can only be missed by someone never experienced in eating either. FAIL.  Understand that our food was brought out by a bussboy who didn't understand the various sticks and plastic they stick in the burgers to mark them. That's why my server came back 5 minutes later trying to stuff the burger I ordered in my face to eat instead. It was obviously cold at that point.  I took bites of the first burger, it sucked. Really disgusting. My stomach was turning and I could not eat anymore. Really disappointing.  We got our bill and they were willing to charge me a fucking arm and a leg for not being able to eat the burger I ordered. They then took the toppings off and charged us for the $17.50 Kobe beef. My wife insisted that was some bullshit (of course she was incredibly polite about it) and it was stricken from the bill. We paid for her food and drink and still tipped 20%.  Pros: It was all in all accommodating. People were friendly and we were seated quickly for an insane time of night. My food was comped for their mistakes. Their attitude was positive even when we were not.  Cons: Don't have bussboys serving food. This is the fastest way to fuck things up in a food service. Have those who are in the fold of the whole order be the one's responsible for serving, that way you can cut down on fuck ups. Problem solved.  I didn't get to have an adult shake... oh well. Not sure I will ever go there again to try it since there are tons of food options here and for my first experience of BB it was sour.",

    "text": "My husband and I had dinner here 2 nights ago. I got the buffalo burger and my husband got the nature source beef burger. The meat was good. We got it well done and the meat is still juice. My husband also got the pretzel bun and he liked it. I had the plain bun and it was good in a way that it is not the soggy kind. I asked for no pepper and no seasoning on my buffalo meat and they were able to accommodate that. I like my meat plain, that is just how I prefer. I usually feel that seasoned meat doesn't taste good as it masked the real meat taste.  The only thing we didn't like as much was the shake. We shared the salted caramel and it really tasted salty. I know we should have expected that it is salty but didn't anticipate that it would be salty enough to make me feel thirsty! It was like after eating msg! The shake does have a secret sauce called \" Fleur de sel\" in it and I don't know if that sauce contain any msg or fermented soy as my throat was terribly dehydrated and very thirsty after the shake. The toffee syrup in the shake for sure contributed to its saltiness too. After we went home, I had to eat an avocado and a plum which were high in potassium to counteract the trauma. I usually eat high potassium food as a remedy if I accidentally eat food with msg or high sodium. So if you can't handle sodium well, don't order the salted caramel shake, try another flavor instead.  The burgers were satisfactory but it is not a \"wow\" yet so we can only give 3 stars here. Especially when we know another burger place serving naturesource beef meat as well, and they can accommodate no seasoning and I think that this other place grills the meat better too. Burger Bar is very pricey too when considering the size of the meat they offer on the burger, so one time try at Burger Bar is enough for us. It is not the place for us to go back again if we have a crave for burger or shake in the future, there are better options in town.",

This is the only place I have ever seen a $60 burger on the menu and trust me friends, I did not order it since it goes against the dietary needs. However, if I did....I'm sure my taste buds would be smiling and my wallet empty from the foie gras and truffles it was prepared with. This burger read deliciousness straight from the menu.  Moving onto my order:  The Vegas Vegan...after all when in Vegas, why shouldn't my be named after the city and its sinful nature? This meatless monster sandwiched a large roasted  (Roma?) tomato and slice of eggplant between two grilled portobello mushroom tops, and was surrounded by a ring of grilled zucchini and squash. To top it off, add a pickle and a large serving of skinny fries. Is it so wrong I thought skinny meant low fat? But there was nothing \"SKINNY\" about these fries but their appearance and they were delicious. My meal was good nothing to complain about but nothing to rave about either.  Good food and good service.",

All I talked about was going here, and finally 1 year later I made it!  Foie Gras, and shaved truffles on a kobe wagyu burger. What else can I really say!  I was thinking, oh my gosh, I'll never be able to finish this and it's gonna go to waste. But when this gem of a burger was delivered to my table I was pleasantly surprised at it's simplicity. It  was perfectly sized and not over garnished. It comes with a side of sprouts and little cup of brown sauce which you can drizzle on your burger, or use to dip your fries.   Some might think, well that's just silly spending $60 on a burger, but it does come with a dessert or shake of your choice.   All in all pretty damn good, and I look forward to trying their other creations!  Be aware that there is often a wait so make a reservation or plan accordingly.",

We just stayed at Mandalay Bay over Labor Day weekend so we had a short walk to one of our favorite spots.  I have to say, the Kobe Beef is one of the best I have ever had. It is so delicious and just melts in your mouth. But if you want to keep it basic (and less expensive) the Angus Beef is a great choice as well! You really can't go wrong.  The only reason I am giving Burger Bar only 4 stars is because our server was a bit off. When we told him he left bacon off of one of the burgers, he said \"well then there's a kitchen full of Mexicans I need to go yell at\". It was so off color and uncomfortable for our entire table that we really didn't want to deal with him any longer.  Other than that odd experience, the food and ombiance is amazing.",

    "text": "Yes. Yes yes yes yes yes. I've always wanted to go to one of Hubert Keller's restaurants (Fleur de Lys being at the top of that list). But since we were in Vegas, we decided to hit up Burger Bar. Okay, for the record, it took us for-ever to find it in the casino, our fault for not being able to navigate I suppose.  Food: Obviously known for their burgers, the range of flavors starts with a run-of-the-mill cheeseburger, to a fine dining Rossini Burger (Kobe burger, sauteed foie gras, shaved truffles, and a rich brown sauce). I settled somewhere in the middle with a Bacon, Cheddar Kobe burger. Very juicy, great bread (a choice of 4), and well-seasoned onion rings. Fries were also really good (offered thick or thin). But the coup de grace was their shake. A nutella shake. NUTELLA....SHAKE. It's freakin genius and I have no idea why it's not sold everywhere. It originally was suppose to have chocolate ice cream. When I asked the waitress which shake I should get, she suggested the Nutella shake, but with vanilla ice cream. Let me tell you....I will be forever grateful to that waitress. Possibly the best shake I've ever had. Rich, creamy, topped with a chocolate whipped cream and garnished with hazelnuts. Friends also had some alcoholic shakes, which were also really great.   Service: Awesome service. Aside from the life-altering choice my waitress helped me with, the servers were good about keeping our glasses filled and coming around every once in a while to check on us.   Overall: I wish there was one near San Diego, alas, to eat at a Burger Bar you must be in Vegas, St. Louis, or San Francisco. But a great restaurant, with awesome service. Oh, did I mention there was a tv in our booth? No? There was. It was awesome. Forewarning: They don't have restrooms in the restaurant and the trek to the bathroom is nice little stroll. But who cares when you can have one of the best shakes ever?",

The place is small, like a dive bar and not what I expected.  I ordered the salmon burger with skinny fries. The fries were crispy and tasty but I have had better salmon burgers at Fuddruckers! I guess I expected since we were in Vegas (where things are bigger and usually better) the salmon burger would blow me away. That it did not, it kind of tasted like it had been frozen for awhile and didn't even taste like seafood. I expected more fishy, I like my salmon tasting like fish at least even though it's a burger. The bf got a regular old hamburger which he was not impressed by either. He said he has definitely had better and by the end of our meal I wished we would've saved our dinner to go somewhere else at the Mandalay Bay. We did end our meal with a strawberry banana shake which was yummy and I would return to get a shake but definitely not coming back to eat a burger.",

    "text": "I'll start this review by saying that I was told by a good friend that this place had the \"best burgers\" he had ever had.  And when I'm told that anything is \"the best\", it almost always fails to live up to the expectation.  Burger Bar fell victim to the same curse.  A buddy and I were in town staying at the Luxor for a trade show that was at the Mandalay Bay, so aside from the recommendation from another friend, we had to walk past Burger Bar every day to get to the Mandalay convention hall.  We almost didn't make the stop, because like usual, Vegas had sucked the life out of me and made me feel sick to my stomach within the first 8 hours of our visit, and neither of us had much of an appetite as a result.  After passing by a handful of  times, though, we decided that our last meal (fitting title for a terrible trip) would be at Burger Bar.  We arrived around 6PM and the wait was 45 minutes.  Instead of being impatient, we saw this as a good sign of things to come and put our names down before heading to waste a few bills and brain cells on gambling and booze.  When we came back and got seated, we were both impressed with the layout of the place.  Booths have private TVs, and the adjacent tables have great views of flat screens that overlook the decent-size bar.    The beer menu was extensive, and I learned that Burger Bar prides itself on its selection of \"rare beers.\"  Although I opted to drink wine, I can confirm that the beer selection here is second-to-none.  They had something like a minimum of 4-5 beers from more countries than I could process in one look.  The only problem is that a person can only drink so much beer when they are eating large amounts of beef.  Not a bad problem to have, though.  Now to the food.  My buddy and I both ordered the Kobe Beef Burger, his medium rare, and mine medium well.  When they came, all looked delectable...until we took a bite.  Mine was barely medium rare, and my friend's almost kicked him in the mouth it was so rare.  I swear I heard the thing \"moo.\"  So we got the attention of our nice waitress, informed her of the situation and asked for a re-order.  But instead of smiling and apologizing profusely, she tried to argue with us about what our respective burgers should look like based on how we ordered them.  Oh boy.  She finally sensed our quickly rising frustration, apologized and took the burgers back.  About 5 minutes later, we get our original order, but they were the EXACT SAME BURGERS, pieces missing from our last bites and all.  Now I'm not one to waste things, so this normally wouldn't be a big deal, but considering the waitress already arguing with us, and the fact that this place claims to be one of the best burger joints to be found, I would expect that they would cook us some new burgers.  I guess I'm expecting too much.  So my friend and I ate our decent, not great, but decent, burgers and moved on out as quickly as possible.  Needless to say, neither of us were thrilled with the food or the experience, and it would pretty much take a free meal to get me back there.  I'm not going to pay close to $20 for a burger and iffy service, when I can go to McDonalds and at least know what I'm going to get.  Bye-bye Burger Bar...",

I loved the sweet potato fries. Delicious. The burger was good, but not worth 10. The server/service was okay (there is always a line to get into this place), but he forgot my beer (even though they were out of what I originally ordered, so it was doubly delayed) and it took forever to get it. I probably would not go here again. I mean, guys in polo shirts and white tennis shoes and their dates. That's what this place is. Zzzzzz. There are so many other dining options in Vegas, and there's nothing special about these burgers. In and Out, in my opinion, is far better.",

My husband loves their large beer selection.  You may ask for a small taste of a new beer selection also. I love their cole slaw.  So many sides too, like avocado, pineapple, sprouts, jalapeno bacon and carmelized onions. The ground mustard is amazing!  Their salads are nice.  The shakes are awesome, many varieties.  They have a \"burger\" dessert made from a Krispy Kreme donut for the roll and a nice slice of nutella for the burger!  Erin is our best favorite waitress at the Burger Bar.  She may have a twin, but there is only one Erin!  Many solo peeps sit happily at the bar.  There is one chicken dish.",

The first time I went, it was only because I heard it was Hubert Keller's restaurant and once I saw the menu, I was not dissapointed.  I love that you can build your own and choose from an array of top shelf items.  You want bacon, you have 3 options (regular, pepper & jalapeno); onions, 3 options as well (raw, grilled or carmelized) and that's just the basics.  You can even start with a Kobe patty and add foie grais and truffles if you're up for it.  The sides are awesome too.  The zucchini fries are off the charts good.  If you want a place to get a great burger and just chill out for a while, this is place to do it!",

I also like that it is also a great bar as much as a burger joint. Don't miss out on some of the best bar tenders in town mixing some awesome drinks. It's a great late lunch place where you can get an awesome burger and a few pops. The grown-up shakes are awesome.",

We ordered a angus burger with bacon and aioli, it was literally cooked so perfect (medium rare) I was crying with each bite.  Their 20$ ultimate Bloody Mary was really bad. It was so thick and the burger and chicken wing we're really bland. I wish I would've saved the 12$ and got a normal one. It was so hard to drink and burned my stomach after every sip. It was like a clamato spicy smoothie yuck.  The wedge salad was perfect. It was really large in size and reasonably priced. The bacon and bleu cheese combination really worked with the iceberg lettuce and it went amazing together.  Their French fries are really good also and were great with the aioli I got for my burger!",

The place is super loud & music is blaring so don't plan on talking to your neighbors... or even yelling.  They won't hear you  There was an impressive list of beers & we chose chocolate stout & a Killians red.  Veggie burgers all around w/ a variety of fixings, all on pretzel buns.  I am loving the fact places now offer pretzel buns b/c they rock!    The patties were homemade but cooked on the same grill as their meaty selections - I mean come on!  There are a plethora of burger places who have the routine down & keep things separated.  It shouldn't be impossible for you to do the same  They forgot my avocado; brought out wrong bun for the Mr; I had to ask for silverware & we were never checked on after the orders were placed.....we were flagging down anyone who would give us the time of day, to fix all our issues & errors  But for filling a pre-show need, as well as an awesome beer selection, have to say A-OK.  For meaty crossover & forgetting almost everything, I've experienced better.  I'd never actually seek this place out to enjoy a meal.  I don't do it in SF; wouldn't do it again in Vegas",

This time I ordered the Wagyu burger with the truffle sauce. I went with the $7 Wagyu upgrade because it was described as \"melt in your mouth\" but it was really cardboard in your mouth. I've eaten a lot of burgers in my life and this was one of the driest I have ever had. Also I paid for a $1.50 Brie upgrade and $1.50 for the pretzel bun. The pretzel bun was rock hard and the Brie was almost non-existent. The burger was also luke warm and the fries were cold.   I would have returned it but it took 30 minutes to bring us our food so we were crunched for time. I couldn't get the waitress' attention because she was busy chatting so I had to stand up and walk over to her to ask to speak to a manager, the waitress came back with a \"discount\" of $2 off of a $30 burger. How generous...Gross, overpriced and bad service.",

It was actually a good choice!  We were seated right away, ordered drinks and ordered food soon thereafter.  From that point on, service was great, our waitress checked in on us at least 3 or 4 times during the course of the meal to ask if everything was OK, and our drinks never got below a few inches from the top of the glass before they were topped off (though at one point, the staff did top off my Sierra Mist with ice water by mistake).  I had the classic burger and fries, which simply came with lettuce, tomato and pickle.  It was a bit spendy at $15.40, but to be honest, it was one of the best tasting burgers I'd had in a while so I thought it was worth it.  My friend ordered the sliders and fries at $13.85 and was also happy with his food.  Soft drinks priced out at $3.75 each.  Touristy Vegas prices perhaps, but the food here was good and so was the service.",

    "text": "*THIS IS A GLUTEN-FREE REVIEW!*  If you love burgers and fries, but have celiac, eat here!    First off, I have two words for you: STEAK FRIES.  Ok, let's make it four words actually: Celiac-safe steak fries.  I gotta be honest with you, I didn't even order them because I had a feeling my giant burger would fill me up (I was right - good call, Teenie!) but the waiter did let me know that they are cooked in totally separate, safe fryers, not with anything breaded or anything like that.  So again- steak fries are safe for those with celiac!  Now the burger:  It was good.  It was damn good.  And I almost couldn't believe they gave me a gluten-free bun, but rest assured, they did:)  I ordered a build-your-own turkey burger with swiss cheese, avocado, and button mushrooms.  It was one of those burgers so big you almost can't even fit it in your mouth but then you're like, \"Oh it's goin down.\"  GDFR.   Bonus:  I also got a good whiskey mule there, served in the traditional copper mug  (why do mules always come in copper mugs anyway?)  A couple things to know about this establishment:   #1)  It's not in Mandalay Bay itself, but in the shopping mall part of Mandalay Bay.  (That totally tripped us up while we were walking around the hotel and casino looking for it next to all of the other restaurants.  You will not find it there!  Go to the shopping mall part of the hotel) #2)  It's kind of small and loud #3)  Our booth did have a little TV tucked away in the wall (basically at eye level) which was cool for watching sports while eating  So there you have it - a burger joint safe for those of us with celiac.  Go ahead and get smashed in Vegas and enjoy a burger here.",

But the three of us girls opted for the build your own burger! I ended up getting the veggie burger and they chose turkey burgers. And since the build your own doesn't come with fries we decided to share the fries trio.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-las-vegas?select=z-yVHO-quYd-SJQrFxSgcA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a>  The build your own comes with lettuce, tomato, and onion on the side so I decided to go with sprouts, smoked gouda, and jalapeno bacon for my add-ons! Yum!!! <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-las-vegas?select=snHoQFUjy-Bw2hJaEnuXWw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/burger-bar-las-vegas?select=EpAW2eL_kRHnNgxGrXkuvQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/burg...</a> My burger was juicy and I really loved the flavor of the jalapeno bacon, it gave the burger a little kick! I enjoyed each and every bite of my juicy creation.   Service was excellent as the staff was refilling drinks, making sure our food was perfect, as well as bringing us extras! We were extremely satisfied and I look forward to returning during my next trip to Vegas!",

    "text": "Not going to lie, I was a little tempted to order this $60 Rossini burger that was on the menu just to say that I've had it. Unfortunately, it sounded too heavy before a night out on the town and drinking, so I opted out.  This is located in the strip mall at Mandalay Bay. I've walked by several times, but had never been in. While you're waiting, they have a free photobooth outside to take some photos. You can either social media tag them or e-mail to yourself. Cool little perk and makes the time go by faster before you're seated. I'm sure there are some great photos as the drunks come rolling through.  A full bar is available and they have a ton of beers to choose from and there are various televisions on different sporting events if you're into that sort of thing.  What I tried: I created my own burger with the Australian Kobe beef with a ciabatta bun, spinach, swiss, fried egg, tomato, and chipotle aioli. This was served with skinny fries that were thin and crispy, just the way I like 'em. The burger itself wasn't everything that I had hoped for. As you know, I feel like I suck when it comes to building my own masterpieces, so I usually opt out. I should have stuck to my own habits and done so again.  I don't think that the spinach necessarily worked on the burger. It was sauteed but really watery making the rest of the burger super moist. I order the meat cooked medium and the combo of spinach and medium meat juices didn't really blend well. To be perfectly honest, I couldn't tell that the beef was that much better than the normal patties that my friends had in their sliders. Next time I will opt for the black angus beef and save myself $8. But at least I can say that I tried it.  I snuck some onion rings off of my friend's plate. They were pretty damn delicious. The onion was sweet inside and the outside was crispy and airy. They stayed crispy throughout the whole meal and I was tempted to order a second round. I was too stuffed, and that weird burger combo kinda gave me a stomach ache. Again, not their fault, I chose the flavors.  Service was good and everything came out fast. Our server was patient with some of my drunk table mates- I'm sure they get a lot of the crazy banter all the time.  I wish I would have tried one of their desserts. They have a good variety of shakes (both alcoholic and non-alcoholic) and something called a chocolate burger.  I would come back and try one of their other burgers and will sub for a side of onion rings. This place is more expensive than a typical restaurant, but it's expected since it's inside a hotel on the strip. Live a little.",

    "text": "After watching Top Chef Masters, I'm a big fan of Hubert Keller. Who else can manage to cook a 5 star meal in a dorm room using a hot plate and a shower stall? I also admire his diverse interests- not many chefs can boast about being a DJ in their spare time!  Anyways, I was excited to try out his Burger Bar restaurant when we were in Vegas. We got here around opening time, and there was already a line forming to try out the delicious burgers. Although we had a large party, we were seated promptly.   We decided to order the chicken wing appetizer, and I had a nutella shake to start out with. The chicken wings were good, but quite small compared to other chicken wings you'll find at other places. The nutella shake was beautifully presented, with elegant swirls of chocolate syrup laced on the inside of the cup. The shake itself was smooth, rich, chocolate indulgence, topped with chocolate whipped cream and a sprinkling of whole hazelnuts.  Although I didn't order the beer float paddle sampler, a person in our party did, and it looked amazing! (See pictures for the evidence!)  Although the Rossini burger was indeed tempting, I decided to forgo the $60 price tag and order the signature Hubert Keller burger ($22). After all, why not order the owner's favorite burger? It was perfectly cooked to order (Medium rare), with tender, flavorful buffalo meat, spinach, blue cheese, caramelized onions, with a lovely red wine sauce on the side. I'm not normally a fan of blue cheese, but it meshed well with the other ingredients. The only slight negative was that the burger really needed the red wine sauce on the burger, otherwise it tasted like it lacked a little seasoning. The fries that automatically came with the burger were decent, with a nice crisp outer layer.  Maybe if I strike it big in Vegas one of these days, I'll splurge on that $60 gilded lily of a burger, but for now I'll go for the other signature burgers!",

Tasted good, one of those \"there's no alcohol in here\" drinks that 5 minutes later you realize there was.  Just wanted a small snack so ordered the mozzarella sticks off of \" The Fry\" menu. They were pretty good, i always look for fried cheese where you can tell they were house made. These are good enough to make me think maybe, but probably not. Good enough to order a second helping of the fairly priced appetizer.  The one negative was the button to change the channel on the TV in my booth didn't work, apparently a known issue as hostess informed me when i was seated. You can request a channel, which i did, but it never changed, so i was stuck watching a very old movie on \"El Rey\".    The service was strong to quite strong, server \"Damian\" was very attentive, i did not have to ask for anything.  Overall, a solid experience, no hesitation to return.",

Makes me happy!  I got the veggie burger, which was good, but a bit on the dry side. You can actually see the vegetables inside the patty and it broke apart a few times which to me is a good thing, because it tasted and looked like it wasn't a frozen patty. I would ask for sauce with it because it was quiet dry when I got it. The whole wheat bun was just okay, I would try another option next time around.  The skinny and fat fries were good. They weren't too oily and I loved the presentation. The Nutella Shake - delicious! Yum! Cute glass it comes in!  Service was pretty good, and I liked the vibe in the restaurant.",

I chose the burger bar sliders which gives you a little variety and who doesn't love that?!?!? My burgers were dry and so were the buns :(  Couldn't we hit them with some butter?   When you come to a place like this & pay more for a strip location & a well known chef your expectations are high. Mine are because Keller is a master. I absolutely love his show on PBS & watch it every weekend! Not only does his food look amazing but he's such a fun & interesting person to watch. The French accent also works :)  So my burgers kind of sucked. My skinny fries were good. Luckily the ladies in my group seemed to enjoy their burgers & I should have just ordered a burger. But the sliders should be great and honestly they don't deserve 3 stars but I'm giving it because my prior experiences were good and I'm hopeful someone in the kitchen will taste them & improve on them.   With that said, there's a reason why Keller is where he is and has so many great spots and I'm not taking anything away from him. Maybe I had an off night, not sure. The service was great. They were packed. Overall a fun time for everyone in the party except my sliders.",

I got a pretty basic one, angus with lettuce, tomato, onion and American cheese with pretzel bun. I was very happy with their quilts of meat, not just some random fast food patty but one you would expect in a nice place like this.

Then more attitude because I wanted to substitute the cheese in my food. She never checked in on us, had to ask the bus boy for drinks. The restaurant was empty so there was no excuse for her being such a crappy waitress.  The food was good and prices were average for the area (high).

First of all, it's a little bit of a walking distance from the Mandalay Bay parking lot, but no more than 10 minutes to get there. Upon entering, it's darkly lit and has a trendy feel to it. All of the booths have a tv screen and our particular booth in the back had a plug for you to charge your items (be careful...it was on the side of the wall, so I feared my long hair would get caught on it). Good addition, bad place to put it. However, The booths can be very roomy- we sat 6 of us!   Overall reaction: service was good, but as soon as it got busy, it was harder for servers to make their way around the tables because of overcrowding.  Burgers were okay (I had the sliders, and my brother had the hangover burger). Not bad, but not amazing in terms of taste. However, there are some burgers on the menu that have a much higher price range, and if I could afford it that night, I'm sure those burgers would've been amazing!   **One thing I did love were their shakes! We had the Salted Caramel Shake & the Irish coffee shake(yes, with alcohol) , and both were delicious and came out with beautiful presentation. If you'd like to add more toppings/mix-ins you can do that, too! There's a whole list on the menu for you to pick from. Try it out! :)",

    "text": "Wife and I dropped in on a Sunday -- they were pretty busy so we sat at the bar instead of waiting for a table. That was fine. Then we ordered the problem here is for most part the burgers are ala carte. Which means it can get pricey. For example if you order a Bison burger that would cost $16, if you wanted cheese, bacon and mushrooms that would cost you another $4 or so then if you want fries or onion rings it adds another $3.25 to $4.50. You can see how this adds up in a hurry. Now I haven coming to Las Vegas for more than 30 years and the food options at the properties has gotten way better but along with that (big shock) way more expensive.  The wife and I got two turkey burgers shared a side of onion rings had two Budweisers and the bill totaled high $40s with tip it was high $50s.  The wife thought the turkey burger was pretty flavorless and close to tough which as she said for what we were paying she expected more in the way of a solid dinner.  We have eaten at Burger Bar several times in the past and thought  it was better but several years ago they took the Greek salad off the menu. The Greek salad was really good. And the Bison burger which I have had several times in the past was good then -- I can't imagine the quality has dropped.  The atmosphere was good there were plenty of TVs which meant we could sit statue bar and watch the Falcons Sunday night game.   The service was decent as always.",

The burgers faired pretty well as take out but there were a couple of hiccups.  Once back in our hotel room, we found that they only gave us 2 of the 3 burgers we ordered and 1 of the burgers had extra toppings, all the toppings of the burger that was missed.  Thankfully, the burgers were pretty big and we ordered 3 sides so there was enough to share.  We had the American Classic with a fried egg and a buffalo burger with caramelized onions, mushrooms and cheese/bacon/fried egg.  One of the two fried eggs popped on the way back to the hotel but it was still pretty good.  The buffalo burger was very juicy and perfectly medium rare, even though it was 25 minutes before it was eaten.  The sweet potato fries were ok as were the regular fries.  The mozzarella sticks were not great but that's because they were take out, if they were eaten right away at the restaurant, they may have been better.  The best part of this meal was that when we called the restaurant to let them know they left a burger off, the guy immediately accommodating and  said the meal would be comped for the mix up.  Pretty good customer service!  That's Vegas for ya!",

When we got seated, it took a pretty long time for the server to take our orders. My friend and I joked that they are going to get 18% gratuity anyways, hence the crappy service.  Otherwise, the food was great. My friend and I decided to split our meal because we had buffet earlier plus it was already late at night. We ordered the chicken hawai'ian burger; we told the server we were splitting. So when our order arrived, we had separate plates each with our own half of the burger with almost a plate full of the sweet potato fries. So as far as the burger, my friend and I didn't expect it to be really tasty. I was surprised that chicken would taste really good with the sweet sauce that comes with any hawai'ian burger. The sweet potato fries was bomb! I couldn't stop eating them... I was glad my friend and I split the meal because we had the same amount of fries that folks ordered individually.",

We waited over a half hour to get in here and I ate a burger for the first time in over 2 years and I was very very much reminded why I gave up such things.   I figured if I was going to eat a burger after all that time I was going to eat one in a restaurant by the darling Hubert Keller.  After such a memorable Fleur dy Lys experience, we figured we certainly couldn't have a bad burger joint experience.... but we did.  The cheese is placed on the burger far too early on the grill, therefore it all melts and slides off, by the time it gets out to the table there's pretty much no cheese.  My bun was soooooo soggy on the bottom that I almost gagged.  The raw onions, flimsy and flavorless, the tomato orange and unripe.   What a disappointment.  My husband was equally disappointed with his fancy burger.    There was nothing that could have gained this place a 2nd star.  Service was shit, even the soda was flat and syrupy.  I'm seriously trying to figure out how our experience was so 1 star compared to all these 3, 4 and 5 star reviews?   What are you all comparing these burgers to?",

Amongst the cheering and yelling of the Colts and Jets fans, we (the burger bureau) took a seat at the bar to indulge in the \"finest\" burger in town.   The menu shows a lot of promise replete with choices of signature and build-your-own burgers. They suit all spenders ($14.00-$60.00 +). Plenty of liquids are also available to wash down your desired selections.   I put in my order for the American Classic--sans cheese, picked up a side of Zucchini fries and elected for a mug root beer.   The Burger Breakdown: The American Classic shared the white oval plate with the Zucchini fries, a pickle and the fixings on the side. The fixings: a slice of raw onion, green-leaf lettuce and a slice of tomato. The burger was cooked to a perfect medium--yet desiccated. This was the first time I have encountered this anomaly. I was disappointed with the lack of jus (fats and oil that were missing). I reached for the root beer after every bite. Yikes. The zucchini fries were well seasoned and made up for this average burger. The burger was fair sized but only fair-flavored.  The presentation was lack-luster and the meal could be described in one word: LACKING. In an otherwise unforgettable trip to Las Vegas, I cannot wait to let this burger slip from my mind. While the selection was plentiful, the choices fell flat across this Burger Bar.",

    "text": "So after years of hearing that we need to try Burger Bar, my husband and I finally decided to take the plunge.  Burger Bar is located in Mandalay Place, which is the shopping area between Mandalay Bay and The Luxor.  There are lots of restaurants around this area and valet is a breeze at Mandalay Place.  Husband and I got right in and had a seat in the booth.  They have a HUGE beer selection (which had the husbands attention immediately!)  But we decided just to do burgers and fries.  I had a Kobe beef burger, on an onion bun, with a fried egg, mayo, lettuce, tomato and onion.  I had sweet potato fries with this.  I ordered the burger cooked medium and I'm glad I did!  If would have ordered it medium-rare, I think the burger would have come out moo-ing at me!!  (mind you- i'm all about medium-rare on a good steak!)  The husband had the American Classic with sweet potato fries.  We both agreed that we would have rather went to Red Robin or Stripburger over Burger Bar.  For one, you would think the Kobe beef would have great flavor.  Not even.  It was OK at best.  Husband said that he thought it was \"pretentious to charge that much for a burger that tasted like that.\"  After both our burgers and fries (we had water to drink) and after tip, we walked out paying $45.00.  Definitely a cool place, and I'm glad I tried it, so I know that I don't ever have to go back.  Definitely disappointed!",

The waitress only offered some sparkling water and when I told her that something was wrong with the food she just said oh sorry you don't feel well and brought me the check. We didn't even eat the other burger. I was sick the whole night. I called the manager the next day and they refused to believe me since I paid cash althought I told them exactly what I ate and what time I was there. She said she has the check the tape and when she did she lied and said it only took 18 mins for burger to get to us. Not True !!! They offered free burgers and I would never eat there again. She was so rude on the phone. Horrible experience expensive burger so not worth it !! Go to bachi burger. Much better service and delicious burgers.",

I did the customize your own burger. I opted for the Kobe Beef burger with grilled onions, cheddar, avocado slices, and skinny fries. Perfect and delicious, loved the skinny fries nice and salty hot and crunchy. The milkshakes look fantastic but i was so full there was no way I could fit more in.   Definitely would go again!!

A good char on the outside with nice a pink in the middle.  Not as juicy as I would have liked, so the Angus meat is lean.  The bun was a regular sesame bun. I was hoping for a brioche at that price.  It wasn't as good as a Bachi Burger.  My friend that the surf and turf.  The hardest part is putting the burger back on the plate.  It's too big and just falls apart.  Sometimes, bigger isn't better.  I don't think I would come back based on the price of the food.  It's good to try once.",

Customized Buffalo Burger w/Pepper Jack Cheese, Jalapeno Bacon, chipotle aoli on a wheat bun and a side of fried pickles encrusted with jalapenos.   +Jalapeno bacon was awesome.. very tasty now if i only could find some in LA   Chef Burger - Blackjack Burger - (Black Angus, monterey jack, tapanade, tomato, lettuce on a ciabatta bun)   This burger was alright... here's my problem though, when it comes to burgers I believe that the toppings should compliment the flavors of the hamburger not be where the majority of the flavor comes from. The burger wasn't seasoned well or the flavor of the beef just wasnt there.  In the future, if i were here to go again, first I would not go unless there was no wait because they do not take reservations. Secondly, I'm fine with paying $35 for a burger and what not BUT it better be worth my money which it wasn't. Thirdly, maybe this is why I like to adventure off the strip and not eat over hyped food.",

    "text": "Food?  Good.  I was definitely a fan of their Sweet Potato fries with my burger.    Ahh the service.  I would like to just say that after this experience I sent an email from their website to the location letting them know about our bad experience, and no one ever contacted me.  Hmmm...what does that say about their commitment to their guests?   So I arrive at burger bar with my two sisters and a mutual friend in tow.  We approach the hostess stand and let them know we are a party of four.  So the host grabs the menus, walks us to a table, sets the menus down, and promptly walks away.  Doesn't say a single word to us during the entire interaction.  Not \"Your serve will be right with you\", not \"Right this way guys\" Nothing.  Just dead silence.  Awkward.  So our dude of a waiter comes up and takes our order, our food comes out, and the guy comes back to check on us once.  Everything came out perfectly we tell him.  So as the meal continues, our drinks get empty.  We kind of all glance around, but no one has seen our waiter walk by in at least 15 minutes.  So finally another server walks by, his name tag read Damien, and he glanced over saw our drinks were empty, and brought over a pitcher of water.  So another 10 -15 minutes goes by...still have never seen our unnamed server...our meals are well beyond finished, and Damien walks by again.   \"Has your server checked on you\"  \"No\"  So he says he'll be right back, and comes back with our checks.  So we pay, and I don't think too much about it until as we are leaving, my sister and I look back and Damien is cleaning our table.  She walks over and politely asked him if he was getting our tip or the dude who took our order.  He informed her that when he went back to check on the server and find out why he hasn't been attending to his table that the guy had left for the night and hadn't reassigned our table to anyone.  So..thanks Damien for your server and F-U dude who deserted out table.",

    "text": "Rossini for the win!  $60.  I will never forget it.  Nor will I ever order it again, because I think my memory would be spoiled if I ever re-tasted it.  Must remind everyone again that we were in Vegas, where money is thrown around like in Monopoly and the atmosphere can cloud your judgment sometimes.  All good.  I think I would've had non-buyer's remorse if I hadn't ordered it.    Went with a group of 10 around noon on Saturday.  Waited all of 5 minutes.  Seating was cozy with a table pushed up against a booth table.  Clean, polished wood, part sports bar, part diner atmosphere.  Had college football going on the tv in the booth and the waitress was cool enough to change it to a game one of the guys requested.  The menu was ka-razy.  You choose your patty and bun ($8-16), then pick from toppings separated into categories (from cheddar to guacamole to jalapeno bacon to shaved black truffles:  $1-30).  Then, you still have sides, dessert burgers, shakes, and an extensive beer menu to sift through.  I was overwhelmed.  I had to go with the package deal, the Rossini.  American kobe patty, onion bun, foie gras, shaved black truffles, madeira wine sauce, served with cracked black pepper, coarse sea salt, and a truffle oil sauce on the side.  The burger was like butter, juicy throughout without much spillage onto the plate.  The flavors in the burger were so rich, I had to really slow it down and thoughtfully taste.  Therefore, I was pretty much done two-thirds of the way through.  But that would've been $20 of burger left so I continued to chomp away.    The fries that accompanied didn't suck, but they weren't memorable.  Tasted some zucchini fries, those were pretty good as well.  Might have gotten tired of them if I had to eat a whole serving.  Your choice of dessert burger came with the Rossini (something I swear I didn't see on the menu) so that was pretty cool.  I chose the chocolate burger--sliced donut, chocolate ganache patty, strawberry slices, passionfruit-pineapple gelatin, and mint ($3.95).  Looked like a cheeseburger, so cool!  Tasted pretty good but grew tired of the ganache.  I thought the cheesecake dessert burger was better, cheesecake was light and almost fluffy.  My chocolate loving homegirl would beg to differ though.  So all in all, I was satisfied with my $60 purchase.  Burger, fries, and dessert.  Another friend loaded up his burger with toppings and it ended up being about $30.  Plus, I figured I'd hit the slots later and recuperate some funds.  Whaddaya know, won $100 on one of those flaming 7s dollar slots.  Sweet...",

It came with a dessert burger which I ordered the cheescake burger and that was also delicious.  The Rossini Burger was a lot smaller than I expected but it was soo good.  The way to order the burger is rare.  Hands down.  Its the only way to enjoy the True flavor of the meat.  The burger came with this delicious sauce and truffle salt and freshly ground pepper.   Heres what you do. Add the tomato and the bean sprouts to the burger, sprinkle some truffle salt (aka CRACK) on the meat, pour some of that sauce, and take a heavenly bite.  Totally worth the money.  However since I'm not rich, I probably wouldn't order it again.  It was a great once in a lifetime experience and everyone should have in Vegas!  Burger bar is awesome.  Prices are fair for Vegas.  Service is great.  Beer selection is VERY VERY impressive.  Lots of great beers on tap.  I would definately make this part of my vegas routine whenever I'm in town!",

I got an ice cold donut with non melted \"chocolate ganache\".... I sent it back. And it looked as if they put the top of the donut burger in the microwave.

The Burger Bar, where you can have a hamburger made out of seemingly unrelated ingredients.  Kobe beef, lamb, fois gras, lobster, black truffles and avocado are just scratching the surface of the mismatched concoctions that come alive at the Burger Bar.  This isn't a buffet table loaded with burger toppings, but made to order concoctions of your own design (though they do have some pre-designed burgers to choose from).  The creative genius doesn't end with the burgers though.  A selection of Beer Floats are available as well.  That's right - Beer Float.  Ice cream and Beer.  We're no longer serving Mary Shelley's Frankenstien and now serving Mel Brook's Young Frankenstein.  And that's not all bad.  When my wife pointed out the Beer Floats, she laughed.  Unflinching, I immediately ordered the Beer Float sampler.  5 different micro-brew style beers, with 5 different flavors of ice cream.  I have to admit, most of them tasted better than I thought they would, and my wife who mocked me for ordering them was also slurping them down (I don't ever need 5 scoops of ice cream).  While I cannot say that the Beer Floats are the best beverage I've ever had, I can say that it was offered.  The burger however, was one of the best burgers I've ever had (second only to Detroit's Miller's Bar).  The Burger Bar is a 3-star setting with 4-star prices and superior burger options.  Strap it to a table, expose to lightning, and you have a place that even a monster could love.",

This is blue cheese and caramelized onion based burger on ciabatta.  I got onion rings on the side.  The onion rings are not bad but not better than say ... Carl's Jr.  I've had plenty of better ones.  I ended up eating only a couple.  The burger itself was great at first.  I was so happy to see they got medium rare right.  However as you keep on eating the caramelized onion really dominates too much and the last few bites get bad.  They say chefs care most about the first and last bites so this burger fails.    The service was great.  I don't think I'll be going back as this place just doesn't stand out.  Bill was $36 for lunch for one with no alcohol so it's steep for the quality.",

We also had the skinny fries and the onion rings...both were great. I also had the strawberry beer, which was good. I will definitely eat here again!!  One word of advice, be sure to specify how much pink you want. We asked for 2 medium well burgers, but one came out more like medium and the other medium rare.",

    "text": "Burger Bar, located in Mandalay Place, is a hamburger lover's dream! The restaurant's name says it all, as this place is literally a \"burger bar\" where you build your own burger. They do have some preselected options as well if you're indecisive, but I recommend building your own. Each burger comes with the standards (lettuce, tomato, onion, and a pickle). But this is the fun part!  Let's start with the meat (or non-meat) selections: angus beef, another beef I don't recall, American Kobe beef, turkey, salmon, and veggie. From there, it's off to bread. They had everything from plain to whole wheat and ciabatta. The best part, however, is all of the other fixings! From cheese (blue, mozzarella, cheddar, swiss, etc.) to other burger oddities like foie gras, they've got you covered. My burger was a turkey on plain bread with mozzarella and peppered bacon. As a side, I had the buttermilk onion rings, and they also offered fries and sweet potato fries. Check this place out!",

She suggested that I get the kobe beef pattie and then add on as many toppings as I like.  I think my eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach b/c when I got the burger, I almost passed out.  I couldn't finish the damn thing.  I chose mushrooms, cheese, spinach and jalapenos b/c I didn't think that lettuce, onions or tomatoes came with the burger.  Der, I know.    The sweet potato fries were crispy and perfectly cut - not too thick, not too thin.  My friend ordered the $ 66 burger, which I found to be too rich for me.  But I'm just a simple girl, so what do I know, right?  Foie gras and kobe beef was not the right combo for me.",

I've been a fan of Hubert Keller's Fleur de Lys in San Franciso, but I was surprised to hear he also owned a burger joint in Vegas. I love the idea that you can build your own burger however way you like it.  There's 3 different types of beef you can choose to start with, $8-$16. Want cheese? Add $0.65. If you're a foie gras lover like I am, add $12. Black truffle sauce, add $5. I also ordered their sweet potato fries, they were pretty good - but I've had better at The Counter in San Jose's Santana Row. ;-)  Overall, this place is definitely worth a return visit for lunch and/or dinner. Grilled foie gras patty for $12? Hell Yeah!!",

Right across from this Tea place at Mandalay and next to the infamous Chocolate Swan. This burger is definitely the shiznit. Not your greasy spoon shiznit. Just somewhere where you can say \"I just spent a hundred dollars on a hamburger!\" Eat this Europe. The French didn't even invent french fries! But this place - Mmmm desert burger.

They have a LOT of burger options, so if you are looking for something different, this is probably the place to go.  I got the cheapest burger on the menu - which was still like 15 bucks.  The burger was thick and juicy but not great.  I honestly would have been just as satisfied with a Red Robin burger (now you know where I'm coming from).  The next step up is a 22 dollar burger, which to me is an obscene amount of money for a burger.  The service was good, but the dining was very cramped - which was probably the biggest surprise about this place.  The coolest part about my visit was that we got to see Hubert Keller.  If not for that, I'd probably give it 2.5 stars.  If you want a rare and expensive burger and a chance to see a famous chef, go here.  If you are just hungry for a burger and don't really care, go to a cheaper place that you know you'll like.",

Anyway, back to Burger Bar.  There are several options:  beef, kobe beef, buffalo, turkey, or veggie.  Then you choose the bun, then the toppings, and then you pay an additional fee for thin fries, fat fries, sweet potato fries, onion rings, zucchini sticks.  I went veggie burger.  For toppings, I went with avocado, colby jack, grilled onions, and oyster mushrooms.  To make up for the fact that a veggie burger costs about $2.00, they had two thick patties stacked on there.  It was actually really good.  I was impressed.  I had onion rings on the side, which were good as well, although, I think they were frozen...no big deal, this isn't a gourmet meal.  Brian, my boyfriend had the Kobe beef burger, with a fried egg and swiss cheese.  He said it was the best burger he's had in a restaurant.  He loved the burger and the thin fries.    Overall a great burger, either veggie or Kobe beef.",

Very good, and worth the wait.       Have you eaten at the Counter?  I find it to be simular.  Expensive, not your everyday burger thats for sure.  $16- $20 depending on what you want on it.  Taste sweet potato fries and zuchinni fries. I recommend to share if you aren't a big eater!",

Everywhere else I order burgers medium-well or well-done, but this one is deserving of a medium or medium-rare. Delicious. - Best beer list I've seen in a while. All sorts of good things to try and tons on tap. I think the tap is like 6-8 feet long. - Sports on TV, including personal TVs in the booths. - Awesome toppings for the burgers and the fried stuff is so damn tasty. - Nice servers and friendly bartenders. Sometimes the host stand staff can seem a little \"inexperienced\" but that doesn't detract from the dining experience.  Just so freakin' good. I can't say enough about this place. I've dragged people all the way down from the Las Vegas Hilton just to have dinner here. Yummy yummy yummy!",

First of all the atmosphere was nice and un-pretentious its not a very big establishment but both times I went right around rush hour it was busy but still room was found for me (both a table and the bar) the staff were friendly and I had great service  I built my own burger both times sticking with the more reasonable angus beef both times  The food was great the sides were nice and hot and good portions that never left me wanting more. The burgers obviously hand made were almost the perfect thickness big enough to make them nice and moist holding in the juices but thin enough to allow the sides room to act on their own  The beer and drink choices were great with many varieties of taps and a full bar  The two things that keep this from being a 5 star is some rather large variability on burger doneness  (one was perfect the other borderline underdone both ordered at the same medium) as well as being a bit pricy for what you get   Overall if I am back in mandalay bay ever I will easily visit this place again",

BUT, all the girls have fantastic customer service and do a great job, so i figure go on with your hot selves. But it's the burgers and milkshakes that keep me coming back.

After reading a few of the reviews about the great beer menu I tried the Troubadour Obscura after delving through the extensive beer menu! I picked it because I love a good stout, but this was the worst beer I have ever had, but that has more to do with my choice than anything else.   As for the burgers I went with a Kobe burger with egg, bacon and avocado and my wife went with the Kobe with pineapple, bacon, and aioli. First I am glad I ordered mine medium-well because the wife ordered her's medium and I swear I heard it moo! I was expecting an amazing burger but it was really only so-so. I have had better burgers at in-n-out and it definitely wasn't worth the $75 bill.   The saving grace was the Black and White Milkshake which was to die for! The shake was thick enough to eat with a spoon and had large diameter straw to accommodate the big chunks of cookie dough in every sip and the chocolate whip cream on top was amazing!!!   The other thing that earned the 3 star rating was the excellent waitress. She had plenty of suggestions based on what her likes were and she was there every time we even thought we need something!",

It is a bit more on the expensive side as burgers go, but I'd pay that much again to eat one (actually going to go try the new one that opened up in San Francisco Macy's).   The ambiance is a classic kind of mix between sports beer bar and steak house. Rich dark colors pervade the establishment. The server was really nice and attentive.

I also ordered the Nutella milkshake. It tasted like an extremely rich chocolate milkshake, nothing like nutella which I love so much.  They had a kids menu also. My son ordered the kids cheeseburger  which was about an 1 and a half in diameter...  My other son got the chicken strips, and my wife got a plan cheeseburger. Add on a couple of sodas... and the total price with tip was around $140.00.  It was a let down. Over priced. Underwhelming.  I prefer BLT burger in the Mirage.",

We got the text a few minutes later.  Unfortunately, when we gave them our name, they pointed us to a table that strangers were already sitting at.  Somehow, 4 people we didn't know were sitting at our table.  They didn't make them move, but they did scramble to put two tables together in the back and get us seated in a few minutes.  The waitress was fantastic (one of the two identical twin waitresses there).  She refilled our drinks every few minutes.  They have a huge selection of gourmet burgers or you can build your own.  Everything was delicious.  The fried pickles did have a little too much breading though.  This being the first, it is still one of the best gourmet burger restaurants in Vegas",

(see my review for \"hot wings cafe\")... now sliders!! i hate this recession!!!! i could have eaten them in one bite.",

I ordered the Country Natural Burger and added bacon, caramelied onions, and cheddar cheese.  Burger was cooked perfectly and exactly the way I ordered.  The fries are ok- nothing special like the burgers.   On the 3rd visit I got onion rings and they were vastly superior to the fries.  Another bonus at this place is the staff.  Great service and very friendly.  Additionally, the hot bartender was wearing a tiny tanktop 2 sizes too small- defintely added to the dining experience.",

The perfect place to take your date when you are well past impressing them, the perfect spot to do a gals night out or just a gals luncheon before the spa or after the pool. The perfect next day hangover food a giant salad. And you know the guys gotta love a spot that has the most beers on tap I have ever seen in a burger joint. With a variety of eye candy running around decked out in Burger Bar outfits. You could even dine here with your family. Its cool all the way around.  With Apple Martini in hand I eagerly scope out the menu to see what famous creator Chef Keller has done to our all American Burger. I almost drop my martini when I learn its really True what they say...My God he put the ultimate on a burger, Foie gras! All I have to say after eating that meal is, how can I eat this all the time? The Kobe beef was perfect topped with Foie Gras. who'd a thought something so sexy can lay on top of an all American dish..the burger.  Seems like Chef Keller brought some of that classiness from Fleur with him to the Burger Bar.",

I love how many different toppings you can choose, and they are all high quality ingredients.  You can go from really fancy (truffles, lobsters, Kobe beef) or just plain ol american.  Either way, it can form to any wallet.  If you dont want to choose your own ingredients they have pre-selected top burgers, the Blackjack burger was really good.  I thought the skinney fries were too overdone, but the sweet potato fries were good.  This time around we tried a milkshake, the Black and White one.  OMG milkshakegasm.  Delicious, creamy, chuncks of cookie dough and homemade chocolate whipped cream.  If that isnt you thing, I hear Burger Bar has the largest selection of beers on tap ON THE WHOLE STRIP.   The french man created the best over the top burger joint- good eats with a healthy dash of Vegas Flash.",

The buffalo burger was excellent: moist, juicy, and properly seasoned. The lamb was good, perhaps too much cumin for my taste, but I definitely preferred the buffalo. The complimentary tomato, onion, pickle, and lettuce was always of excellent quality.  I always had ciabatta rolls, which stayed intact but yet had an easy to chew consistency. I always had my burgers with smoked gouda or cheddar cheese. My sides were regular or sweet fries and spiced ketchup. Definitely get the spiced ketchup, which is so much better than the Heinz variety. As usual, I ordered wheat beer on tap for drinks.  This place is not cheap. My individual tab ranged from $33 - $43, including tax & tip. But this is the strip and the burgers were some of the best I ever had. Normally I would balk at paying such prices, but I accept that the combination of location & quality mandate this.",

The entire time, we were telling the hostess to just split our group into groups of 4 or 6, and every time, they would just tell us, \"it's okay.. it'll just be 15 minutes.\"  During that hour and a half of standing in the middle of the mall, groups and groups and groups and groups of 4 or 6 white people were promptly being seated.  It's a lot of fun to watch somebody show up, get seated, eat, pay, and leave, while you're still waiting for a table.  After we finally sat down (we demanded that they the let us take the next seatings regardless of the size of tables), service was good, and the burger was mediocre (maybe worth 3 yelp stars).  Not that good when compared to the Father's Offices and Umami Burgers of the world.  My nutella shake was pretty solid also.  But our experience was so atrocious that I've got to give it a 1 star.

    "text": "I musta missed something here? We came here based on Yelp Peep reviews wanting to drink and watch the game. We already had food comma from today and just wanted a place to have a good burger and watch the game.  We ordered: - Hangover Burger - Baguette Burger - Lambert Rasberry Beer - tea   Pros:  - Fries came with our gourmet burgers; very good - burger meat was very generous and good quality  - burger was bigger than the bun - Lambert beer was good - booth seats had a TV each - lots of TV's everywhere  - big place and good for big groups - good customer service especially from Jessica - great location  Cons:  - Burger itself had no flavor so we had to add seasoning  - Burgers were small (looked bigger on the picture!) - Burger were super greasy  - The Brie cheese added to my Baguette burger was small that didn't even cover the burger.  - prices are high  I left a little sick from the grease of the Baguette burger I had. I ordered some tea to wash the food down and to melt the greasy feeling I had in my mouth. This place is great to hang out, have drinks and watch the games but we were not satisfied with the food especially at the price we paid. We may not be back...[34/100]",

    "text": "Came here for the first time on Saturday evening, night before the 2017 superbowl. We had came here kind of late in the evening as friend came into town around 0915PM. By the time we got down to Mandalay Bay, parked, and found the restaurant, it was closer to 1000PM.   Oh side note, the restaurant is located between Mandalay Bay and Luxor, in the shoppes, more towards Luxor, so it may seem like a little walk before you see it.   We were promptly seated within a few seconds of requesting for a table. The place was fairly empty. 1/2 full or maybe less. Mainly with some larger groups.   Typically we don't really go to burger places unless this friend is in town. He's a huge fan and lover of burgers so its almost became a tradition to go to a burger place or a pizza place.   My party was a party of 4, 2 being larger guys, 1 tiny girl, and an average sized guy. We were sat at a booth. 2 larger guys can but definitely wont be comfortable sitting on the same side. These booths are more toward the smaller side, even for 4 people.   Our waitress came shortly to take our drink orders. Then a few minutes later, our meal orders.   Their burgers are more on the pricey side but as expected from a restaurant inside a casino, and from a more named chef.   I had ordered the reuben. Our burger loving friend got the hangover burger. My tiny female friend (lol...) got the American classic with bacon on the side (shes not a fan of bacon, nor am I), and our other friend got a salmon burger  ------------------  \"The Reuben\" consists of a black angus beef patty topped with sauerkraut, corned beef, homemade mustard and swiss cheese on a whole grain bun served with a side of skinny fries priced at $19.80  \"The Hangover\" consists of a black angus beef patty smothered in hangover sauce topped with chopped lettuce on a sesame bun served with FAT fries priced at $13.95  The \"American Classic\" consists of a black angus beef patty topped with American cheese, crispy bacon, tomato, onion on a sesame bun served with a side of skinny fries priced at $15.40  The \"Evolve Salmon\" consists of grilled salmon topped with roma tomatoes, baby spinach on a multi grain bun served with a side salad with lemon vinaigrette priced at $15.65  ------------------  Food came out fairly quick. Most of us ordered medium for our patties with exception for the \"American Classic\" being medium rare. They were all cooked at about the same doneness of about a medium. A nice crust with a warm red center. Also, another \"consistent\" thing that we felt was in all our burgers was the patty was severely underseasoned. My friend opened up her burger and went ham on sprinkling salt on hers. I just sprinkled sparingly before every few bites. A little salt went a LONG way and it definitely helped.   When my burger \"The Reuben\" first arrived, I was like WTCRAP I got 3 small slivers of corned beef? then my friend told me he sees it under the melted cheese. Lol almost flipped the table for paying such a higher premium for 3 slivers. With the added salt, the burger was fairly tasty. The bread used was nicely toasted, and had a good firmness to it without being hard.   Skinny fries was about the same thickness as, per se, fries from McDonalds. Not bad. Comes with a nice pickle spear too. Dunoe why the \"Evolve Salmon\" came with 2 spears vs our 1. Om nom nom pickle. XD   Friend had mentioned the \"hangover sauce\" is similar to thousand island dressing, maybe something like spread from In n out too. xD   All in all. Decent place. Friend thoroughly enjoyed it. Ate his own and finished my friends 1/3 left over. I've never been much of a burger lover so it was ok to me. Lol   Not sure how busy they'd be normally during normal meal times but it was pretty easy when we went. Took them quite a while to bring the check though.",

I dipped mine in ranch and it was great. Perfect size app.   I then had the Greek burger. It had a great Tzatziki sauce on it. With onions and pita bread as the bun.   My partner had the Baguette burger which was great. The bread was not hard like most baguettes.   French fries were good. Nothing to go crazy over. But still all together great meal and great prices.   There is definitely something for everyone if you love burgers. Some vegetarian options too!",

    "text": "I have been to Burger Bar on a number of occasions over the years and have never really been blown away by the burgers.   On this particular occasion we were here for happy hour. Service was great from start to finish. Pleasant and extremely attentive by several different servers and bartenders. The drinks were good as well. Prices were right and I stuck with the strawberry mojito on special while my fella got a beer as well as a mai tai that he enjoyed for the most part. The happy hour food was les than stellar. The wings were probably the highlight, but they were a little dry and lacking in any real spice. The chicken tenders were sad and were similar to ones we could get at Denny's. The sliders were the least appetizing of everything we ordered. Lacking in flavor and after one bite I wasn't interested in eating any more.  I have had some good burgers here in the past but nothing particularly noteworthy. I do remember enjoying their sides quite a bit and after a relatively lackluster happy hour we ended our meal with the cheesecake burger that ended up salvaging our whole dining experience. Not the best donut I've ever had but the combination of cheesecake and fruit nestled inside a glazed donut bun was the perfect ending to our meal.",

    "text": "Came here last week while on a business trip...I was looking forward to getting something to eat and based on some previous experiences here I was anticipating a good meal. I sat myself at the bar because it was happy hour and thought about partaking in some of that, but quickly realized that I was going to a meeting in a few hours I skipped over that but did order a \"Happy Hour\" wedge salad for $6.95? Ouch! After a quick glance of the menu I decided on the salmon burger and ordered it protein style.  After a not too long of wait the burger came out and this is where some of the disappointment came in.  The burger was literally a piece of green leaf lettuce the salmon (no sauce of any kind) the salmon ($13.50) + avocado + bacon + some chipotle aioli ( now all of this is separate and added up to $7.70 Rip Off!) same lettuce tooth picked down. Not wrapped in any way or an attempt. Just a sloppy put together presentation that ended up just having to be cut with a knife and fork. But if I am going to be charged $21.20 for a burger then you better do it right. Well not this time and the only reason I am keeping this as a 3 star is because of past visits here and not entirely this one. One another note the lady sitting next to me also ordered a burger protein style as well and hers was put together just as sloppy if not more. So lesson here for this joint is not everyone likes a bun or can have one so this is something you need to nail. Maybe have your chefs go to Red Robin or the Habit to get some protein wrapping knowledge. Your flavors are great but your prices are high and if so you must deliver on everything.",

Since we were on a time crunch, we decided to see if we could find a place that was a little more accommodating.    Enter the Burger Bar.  As a fairly recent vegan convert, I was skeptical by the name of the joint.  It just conjures up unappealing visions of ground beef.  I figured they must have some type of veggie burger and took my chances.  Lo and behold, there was a veggie burger, and it sounded good, it was a chef creation with great ingredients that you would find in a vegan burger, even caramelized onions went into the making this burger...but it's not vegan because they put cheese into the patty, not on it.  I was hoping it was placed on top, and I could just order it without the cheese.  So disappointing.  But on the bright side, there was a Vegan Vegas burger, baby!  It had grilled eggplant, red pepper, and Portobello mushrooms acting as the bun.  No bread in this baby. I had a side of fries and a pickle spear.  It was delicious, and such a huge portion that I couldn't eat it all.",

    "text": "For me, Burger Bar was an intended destination -- not an accidental find.  I went specifically because I am a fan of Chef Hubert Keller and wanted to sample his take on burgers.  I really enjoyed it.  FOOD Because it's Hubert Keller, I was expecting an \"elevated\" burger, which seems to be a trend amongst respected chefs.  My burger fit the bill.  I took advantage of the \"create your own burger\" option on the menu.  You can choose from three different types of beef (angus, nature source, or Kobe), lamb, or buffalo.  Then choose from six types of buns.  Then choose from a seemingly endless menu of cheeses, sauces, and additional items.  My creation: the naturesource patty with smoked gouda, bacon, fried egg, peppercorn sauce on a pretzel bun.  I ordered it \"medium\" and was told that Burger Bar's medium is red inside, not just pink.  This was an accurate description -- and perfect!  My particular burger did not come with sides, but if you order from a chef's creations section, fries are included.  One friend in my party had chicken wings (delicious).  Another ordered the \"Hubert Keller\" burger which was made with buffalo and served with skinny fries.  She enjoyed it.  Another friend created a \"healthier\" and enjoyed it (though she said he liked Burgr by Gordon Ramsey better; I have not been there, so I have no comparison.)  We ordered steak fries and fried pickles for sides.  Both were great.  They also pride themselves on their shakes.  We did not try these or any type of dessert.  AMBIENCE It's...fine -- nothing elaborate or terribly unique.  Burger Bar is in the middle of the Mandalay Place shops, and it feels like a mall restaurant.  It's comfortable enough, but don't expect award-winning design or a \"cool\" vibe.  LOCATION At the Mandalay Place shops between Mandalay Bay and Luxor.  If you're staying at either of these hotels, it's great and an easy walk.  For those going by car, I suggest using valet.  Easy.  PRICES Fair.  I think my burger was about $20 with all my extra add ons.  If you add sides, a salad, and a drink, you could easily be at about $30 per person.  NUTSHELL It's a good burger.  I've been to Holstein's at the Cosmo up the strip, and it's comparable as far as quality and price (though Holstein's is more of an atmospheric destination.)  You'll enjoy Burger Bar...but expect to pay just a little extra than a typical restaurant burger.",

Everyone in our party ordered a different burger, and all were extremely happy with their choices. I will absolutely be going back here next time I'm in Vegas. The service was equally as great as their food. They also have small TVs in their booths playing sports which is a nice change from constantly having to look around at the TVs on the wall. Good place to have a great burger and enjoy a game.",

    "text": "A lot of the restaurants in big casinos put more emphasis on being eye-catching and different, while the food is too often an afterthought.   This isn't the case at Burger Bar. For serving some of the most common food in our culture (ground beef), they really do it right. Sure, it's a little more than a fast food burger, but you'll leave more satisfied.  All the burgers are tender, juicy, perfectly cooked, and the service has been top notch every time I've been there. The little TVs at each table are a nice touch also, particularly when you're with a couple chatty friends who are busy \"catching up\"; it gives you something to do while you savor your meat.  Highly recommended when you're in the mood for a great burger.",

In fact, the zucchini fries and mac and cheese croquettes are arguably the best sides I have ever had at a burger establishment. As a result, I debated whether I should rate Burger Bar with five stars for that reason alone. In the end, I had a hard time doing so since burgers are supposed to be the focus.  Overall, what I have learned after two trips here is that the American Classic is better than the Kobe Burger. And that the side orders are consistently amazing.",

    "text": "There's a loooong wait here for a reason. Burger Bar is awesome. The best thing about it I would say, are the endless options (customizable burgers, drinks, etc). Not to mention the deliciousness. Burger prices range from normal to ridiculous ($60) for those with fancy tastes. There was turkey, salmon, normal beef, Kobe beef, etc, with all sorts of fancy toppings available. (The expensive one had truffle essence...I still have no idea what that tastes like).  We ended up splitting a Kobe burger (they charge for splits, ugh!)  as pictured (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FxPX-07JmgKNbObjsoYBP2g%2Fl&s=69b8d9766adf3e01585f2e9fcdd9e9d42c0a849a9b01ef2dfce25b3e77bc3554\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bp...</a>). The patty was impossibly tender and wonderfully seasoned. We ordered a dipping sampler for our fries ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia2.ct.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FGB-CP9WLcVvQKnjJ0-d2fQ%2Fl&s=c0180282f109c38a62ed4acaa8f3cabd2bb9953efcd7a900f6d2f615530187f4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media2.ct.yelpcdn.com/bp...</a>). It was super-fun to try all the sauces. I liked the chipotle sauce the most. I also got seriously what I consider the most luscious Strawberry Margaritas ever (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia1.ct.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FWoZJlUx7yG4yrR6ycTuXbw%2Fl&s=9fa2fbbc3c6943dc801029f2297db1cf4b275e10119b6cdca3d83e9ad414d117\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media1.ct.yelpcdn.com/bp...</a>). I had TWO of them. There was a lot of fresh, sweet strawberry puree in there, as well as scattered mint leaves for to make it even more refreshing.  Last, we topped our meal off with dessert. There were many, many choices available...including alcoholic milkshakes, with customizable flavors (pick the liquor, pick the flavor)! Amazing. We settled on the dessert burger, which consisted of donuts sandwiching a sheet of passionfruit jelly, kiwis, strawberries, and gnutella (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fmedia4.px.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2F7p_GLg35zpGOLnw-FjHLqg%2Fl&s=8648d5182f76eb7428ed327ae4eb08a9f531e564e54ab18ed686c872cb9f3ea0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">media4.px.yelpcdn.com/bp...</a>), accompanied by a drizzle of raspberry sauce and a dollop of whipped cream.

Truly stellar meat - I chose the mid-grade USDA prime 'Naturesource' - combined with a great potato bun and fresh toppings to make a perfect, perfect burger.   It didn't hurt that they knew how to make a 'rare' burger - it was warm yet still red inside with a nice char on the outside.  The skinny fries were hot and crisp and the beers were excellent - an ale and a fairly obscure stout.  The place is often packed - I chose to eat at the bar instead of waiting for a table.  I'm usually a bit leery of eating at the bar....but the bartender was excellent.  She was obviously used to people eating at the bar and knew how to give sufficient attention to someone needing both food and drink.  As the evening wore on (I was waiting for a late show) I tried the pepper jack cheese shots.  I still don't know how much I liked them - they were crispy on the outside and nicely spicy but the inside consistency was kind of like a cheesy, potato-y, croquette.  I bit weird...yet yummy.",

Beyond the phenomenal food Burger Bar gets five stars for the following reasons.  1.Our waiter Sergio (I think) took great care of us.  Good recommendations and excellent timing.  2.  The prices are cheap by Vegas standards.  Burgers for two with a fry sampler and a few beers came in around ~50$.  3.  The hostess made a mistake and seated us in a section that was set to be occupied by a large group.  We were seated for maybe 5 minutes when the manager came over, apologized profusely and politely asked us to move a few booths down.  Our group was fine with his apology and had no problem with moving.  He insisted on knocking 20% off our bill which was an unneeded but nice gesture.  The manager also made sure to check on us and seemed genuinely concerned that we had a good time (which we did).  4.  They had an excellent beer selection.  Over the last few years I have been happy with good beers making their way to Vegas and Burger Bar has jumped on that bandwagon.  I had a few Dogfish Head 60 minute IPA and there were three or four more beers I would have gladly ordered.  Burger Bar.... we will definitely be back.",

I picked an angus beef burger w/blue cheese, seared fois gras and carmelized onions. Needless to say I was in burger HEAVEN with one bite of this concoction! The fois gras was cooked perfectly and covered the patty so no little smear here folks! One little word of caution: we had ordered our patties medium rare but when a friend's came out first and she had medium, we realized that medium was medium rare to them so order one level up IMHO.   We also had the trio of fries and fried zucchini... all very good and the dipping sauces were a lot of fun and tasty too!

I had a turkey burger with bleu cheese, caramelized onions and sauteed mushrooms - he had the minis and we shared the fantastic panko crusted onion rings. Everything knocked my socks off, I was seriously enjoying myself. The burger I ordered was HUGE and I ate a good 95% before giving up and giving in. My only complaint would be that they do not serve Mich Ultra( I know, you dark beer lovers are shaming me because they DO have a great beer list - just not what we prefer!) so we had to settle for a pitcher of Mich Lite.

I was dying to try the Rossini but didn't... the $50 I saved was better spent elsewhere.  Sports lovers should sit at one of the booths -- you can watch the game du jour in slack-jawed silence while you eat!  Yeah, it's kind of expensive for a burger, but sadly, it's a good deal for palatable food in a Vegas where cheap AND tasty food no longer seems to exist.",

So glad I won some money after the lion king show so we could eat here. It was either win some money and eat here or lose my last 50 and have dorritos for dinner and breakfast. It was a bad trip on the gambling front.  The food was wonderful! We had the onion rings and skinny fries. The fries were good but the onion rings were outstanding. Onion rings are one of my favorite foods and these did not dissapoint. Im wondering why there are not so stellar reviews on them. Trust me there good.  I had a the black angus, with pepper jack, jalapeno bacon, lettuce, tomato, pickle, mayo, ketchup, and mustard on an Onion Roll. The burger was a cooked a perfect medium rare and I mean absolutely perfect. The meat tasted very good and it melted in mouth. A perfect blend of fat in the meat. The jalapeno bacon was crazy good and Im wondering when I can have that again. Im gonna go out on a limb and say this was the best burger I've ever had. I cant think of another that was any better and Ive had a lot of burgers in my day. The onion bun was also delicious.   My girlfriend had a similar burger and she was also very impressed. If your at Mandalay Bay its a must and its even worth a 15 dollar cab ride for this place. Highly reccomened. I wish I would have got a shake to share for desert.",

They do an amazing caramel apple martin It's not on the menu anymore but the staff here is so great they will make it if you ask. The fry sampler is a must there regular fries are great crisp with a cream interior and the mac n cheese croquettes are yummy melting chees perfect pasta fried just right. The pepper jack cheese shots were also amazing with a nice punch of heat and the best zucchini fries I've had anywhere. We got ours with the sauce sampler I would highly recommend the basil aioli as a dipper and the spicy ketchup. If you go anywhere in vegas this is one of the must go super staff great food great drinks it doesn't get better then Burger Bar",

I had the Angus burger on chiabatta bun with prosciutto, Monterey jack cheese, and the red wine reduction sauce.

The second time I ordered the Country Natural and customized it to my liking; I was very satisfied this time. The meat was juicy, the bun was tasty, and the sauce gave just the right complimentary flavor. The fries were also seasoned and cooked perfectly so that they were nice and crispy but not burnt.

    "text": "After spending a good 25 minutes across the way at Lush, I felt like my masculinity was challenged by all the essential oils and body scrubs, so what do I decide to do?    Burger Bar!  This place is for the guy's guy.  Cute female wait staff and hostesses wearing as little as possible, little TVs at every booth with big ones along the wall showing manly shows like ESPN and Poker tournaments, two full pages of exotic beers and other booze, huge burgers with any kind of topping you could dream of, and five kinds of fries.  I simply sat in and soaked up the testosterone, and all those girly exfoliant soaps were washed right out of my mind.  The main focus of Burger Bar is the burgers.  This place has burgers with many options for a total customizable meal.  First, you choose your burger meat, with the basic being their Ridgefield beef for around $8.95, Angus beef for $10, Kobe Beef for $13+, and even a veggie burger for the Vegs out there.  You can choose from among 5 different buns, and the whole thing comes with lettuce, tomato, and onions on the side, for you to put on at your leisure.  On the right side is a long list of toppings for your burger, ranging from the mundane to the extravagant.  For example, you could have grilled onions on your burger, or cheese, or bacon; you could also have a half a lobster tail, shrimp, foie gras, or black truffles.  Each topping comes with its own price to add to the burger, which makes it easy to overspend.  With sauces as well, you could be paralyzed by the sheer number of choices.    Not to worry!  Burger Bar has selected a few choice \"Chef Burgers\" for you, with toppings pre-chosen and an accompanying price.  One is a simple burger with just the meat, the bun, cheese, and some bacon on it, for about $12, I believe.  The top of the line is a monster called the \"Rossini\", which sounded like they just wanted to take the most expensive and rare items and put them all in one burger.  This burger contains the Kobe beef, along with grilled foie gras, the black truffles, and a few other delectables, for a whopping $60.    Overall, I liked it.  The service was prompt, but tended to leave you alone most of the time, the food was really good and very filling (I made my own choices, it was good).  The coffee here sucks, though; don't even bother with it.  All-in-all, walked out paying $35 even with tax and tip for two people.  Not bad at all.  I might have to come back when I'm rich to try that Rossini...",

I've decided to forgo the typical review of atmosphere, appetizers, drinks, etc because the burger was just THAT good. My friend and I split the Kobe Burger with a thin layer of aoili, provolone, carmelized onions, and the winning topping, as always, a fried egg.   Cooked medium-rare, aka to perfection, this burger was everything one dreams about. Melty-cheesy-juicy, full of flavor, oh my gosh. It's 9:30am. I want one right now!

She messed up a beer order and then just said go ahead and keep it. I thought that was great until she came back 5 minutes later and repossessed the beer. When asked why she was taking it back she said \"you did not order it\".  I said you gave it to me and she again said you did not order it. Mind boggling. I inquired again 10 minutes later and she still had the same attitude. It gets better though, the food was horrendous. I had a turkey burger that had absolutely no seasoning or taste, two other people got burgers that were not even close to cooked right (think medium well that was actually totally red raw), and the fries were soggy. Sending back the burgers just gave our server more attitude.  Horrible service, bad food. Do yourself a favor and skip this place, there are tons of other great restaurants in town.",

    "text": "From the creative genius that brought you the Fleur de Lys restaurant, Hubert Keller brings you the Burger Bar. This place leaves most gourmet burger places in the dust. With its various choices to build your own burger.. to the chef's signature burgers... it's not your typical burger place... definitely and certainly not.  Last year, I selected the Hubert Keller burger which was a buffalo burger with caramelized onions, baby spinach, and blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. It was delicious however there was one burger that stood out on the menu that I was hesitant to try at first. The $60 Rossini.  Fast forward to a few weeks ago, I decided to test out this burger to see what the whole hype was about... to see if a burger would be even worth that much to me. What crazy person would pay that much for a burger and why??  Well.. nonetheless I was curious and crazy enough to do it. I must say, though I can see how some people may not find the Rossini not not be worth the exuberant amount they ask for.....   I found it to be utterly delightful!! From the juicy tender kobe beef patty, to the foie gras and black perigord truffles.. I was difficult for me to find myself eating a regular burger after having taken a bite out of this burger. The madeira sauce complimented the burger wonderfully and going halfway into the meal.. I just thought to myself.. I just ate $30 worth of food right there.. and as I contemplated if this whole meal was worth the money and hype.. I decided that the answer was a definitive and crazy, YES.  Finishing off with a cheesecake burger.. it was a nice wonderful experience... Also, I must note.. I was there with two other people from the SF bay area.. and we watched the Giants win the World Series as we finished up our meal. Ahh.... definitely a cherry top finish.",

She was not friendly and it looked like she didn't want to be there or serve us.  Our food came out after 30 minutes and my burger was dry and not good at all. My friends burger was fine, she said it was alright but we both have had much better food elsewhere.  The prices are high as well for such crap meat. Go to stripburger instead.",

Our bartender was superb and stayed on top of the beverages and checked in with us frequently.  I had a turkey burger which had a depth of flavor that is lacking in many restaurant turkey burgers. I added pepperjack cheese, avocado, and the usual lettuce, tomato, onion.  All great. Even better was the sweet potato fries!!! So many restaurants seem to have difficulty getting them to stay crispy but these were perfect and full of flavor.  My friend got a bacon, egg, and cheese burger and was in love as well.  The best part about this place is the fun milkshakes!  My friend got a Murphy's Stout \"float\" with coffee ice cream, tons of yummy whipped cream, and chocolate covered espresso beans to garnish. I am not a beer drinker or a coffee drinker, but I had a taste of this and it was pretty damn good!  I ordered the Mint Chocolate Chip milkshake which was so sinfully good. It had mint choc chip ice cream, peppermint schnapps, CHOCOLATE whipped cream (!), and two big fat Oreos to garnish.  Oh man this thing was a meal in itself but soooo good I finished every drop.  It's pricey, but it's Vegas and expected and worth every penny!",

    "text": "Definitely not a six-dollar burger.  My husband and I were staying at the Luxor and happened to wander into the passage connecting the Luxor to Manadalay Bay when we came upon the Burger Bar.  I first heard of the Burger Bar from the Food Network.  The Burger Bar is an upscale burger joint.  To me, it was like a chic version of Red Robin.   The wait was only about 15 minutes.  We were seated at a booth with a TV on the wall.  My husband was happy because ESPN was on.  Wow, burger, fries, and sports... the perfect combination for every guy.  There are two options when ordering your burger.  You can order pre-assembled burgers where the ingredients are chosen for you, but there are no substitutions if you go this route.  Or you can order the patty and toppings individually to create your own customized burger.  I chose to create my own burger.  I ordered the cheapest patty (relatively speaking) which cost $8.95.  My toppings included pepper jack cheese, avocado, and cinnamon bacon.  My husband ordered the Kobe burger which cost twice as much as my \"cheap\" patty.  The Kobe beef burger is NOT worth the extra cost.  Between the el cheapo patty and the Kobe, go with the el cheapo.  Fellow Yelper Mike L. mentioned he got a free dessert with the Kobe burger, however, we didn't get a dessert, nor were we offered or aware of one.   The zucchini fries were excellent!  Crispy and hot!  My husband also order a Sierra Mist with a shot of peach syrup.  This drink was so sweet that one sip would rot your teeth.  After a sip of this sugary concoction, my Coke tasted like water.  Our waiter was a bit on the cranky side.  He was very robotic when it came to taking our orders and seemed agitated when we asked for ranch with our zucchini fries.  Perhaps he was a little disgruntled because he had to work on a Saturday night...  Grand total for burgers, fries, and drinks (sodas) for two at the Burger Bar came to $53.00 with tax and tip.  OUCH!  The Burger Bar is great for the upscale clientele who craves the \"poor man's palate\" of burgers and fries.  For burgers, I'll stick with Red Robin.",

    "text": "During our entire trip to Las Vegas, we wanted a burger, and we were longing for a nice, cold, tasty beer.   Las Vegas is not only a desert environmentally, but in terms of quality, there is a sore lack of good beers, good wine, good whiskey, and good food at reasonable prices.  In terms if beer, it was quite difficult to find anything other than the usual swill.  In fact, this is the only place we managed to find a nice selection of beers - and they weren't $10 each either.  We were told at the entrance that we would need to wait 30-45 minutes, so we sat down at the bar and managed to find a few beers we hadn't tried before.  One was a Black IPA from Stone Brewing Co. and my wife had something else, I think it was European and smooth.  We talked about beer with the bartender and a fellow sitting by us and the bartender offered us what's called the Deschutes Black Butte XX, a variation on their Black Butte Porter, but much better.   We thought about the offer and decided we would wait until we got our burgers.    In the meantime, we continued to talk about beer and convinced the fellow next to us to try his first IPA - Dogfish Head 90 minute (they were out of the 60 minute).   I'm not sure what he thought about it, but he certainly agreed it was strong and hoppy.  The wait didn't seem to long, and we eventually sat down at a table and started to wait for our burgers to arrive.  We ordered their buffalo burger and their American Classic (basically a bacon cheeseburger).  I asked if the waitress if they made their own meat, and indeed they did.  The burgers were among the best we have had.  Juicy, tasty, well cooked, no fillers, quality meat.  During our feast - these burgers were big - the Black Butte XX arrived which made our  meal even more delicious.      If the burgers weren't enough, we decided to have dessert, well I decided, because my wife was quite full, but the dessert burgers looked good.  My wife's burger was marginal, but I had a delicious burger that was basically some fruit, whipped cream, and donuts for the buns.    In any case, when I return next year, which will be for DEFCON, I will have top my visit off with a trip to Burger Bar.  You can go to some big expensive, overpriced restaurant with a chance that you'll actually get something of quality, and I'll go to Burger Bar.",

This is a build-your-own-burger place and they have an amazing selection of meats and things to put in your burger. The last time I was here, I ordered a regular angus patty with grilled onions, American cheese, prosciutto, bacon, and garlic aoli on the side. I love the onion rings here! They are the type that when you bite in, the whole onion doesn't come out! How nice. A little on the pricey side but worth it. Huge portions too!  A little hint... This place is almost always packed and usually there's a crowd outside waiting. Helpful hint, find yourself a seat at the bar! You get the full menu PLUS you can order alcohol directly from the bartender. I don't know why people don't think about doing this... So don't be dumb, feed your tummy, and sit at the bar.",

I was very apprehensive because I feel like a burger doesn't need all those additions but it was pretty good, he loved it. I got the sliders and got to try three different kinds of burgers, they were all great especially the Buffalo! The fry sampler is perfect because you can pick three sides to share. The sauces for the fries aren't that impressive so save your money for a shake!   The flights of beer are super fun, you get a choice of six different kinds.",

Sadly, it was not just one bad burger, it was two in a row.   All in all, the staff is nice, the place is very clean, and the overall experience was not bad.

You basically build your own burger.  There's alot to choose from, so you may as well utilize the helpful staff so you can have a good experience.  (Asking restaurant staff's opinion is an underrated activity.  It also explains the grumpy reviews on this page.)

Service was prompt in the beginning, but once we ordered, it felt like they had to go to the fields to kill the meat.  Once the food came, we were happy. I had the Turkey burger with caramelized onions, swiss, button mushrooms, on an onion bun YUM!  My hubby had the buffalo burger with pepperjack, oyster mushrooms - also yummy!  Onion rings and fries were yummy.  Fried zucchini were okay. Now, the NUTELLA CHOCOLATE SHAKE was like a drinkable Italian Perugina Baci candy!  Order this as a dessert because it is REALLY rich!

Tender, juicy and came in a really fat patty mmhmmmm. They have a pretty large selection so if you're indecisive you're kinda screwed. Since it's a burger 'bar' you can build your own  burger & customize what you put on it, and they had a pretty good variety of choices.. including truffles or FOIE GRAS if you're feeling fancy!  Their sweet potato fries & fat fries were pretty good, but he winner of the night was the mound of ZUCCHINI FRIES ! I was setting myself up for a heart attack but it's Vegas, baby and I didn't care !  They also have a GREAT beer & wine selection, our table got the chimay & fruli  & they were both delicious ! I prefer the chimay though.  At the end of the meal a nice lady asked to take our picture for us, then printed it out in keychains as a souvenir (..for FREE)  ! I thought that was a really cute touch and showed their customer service is a priority.",

If you are staying at a hotel on the strip, you could probably care less, but navigating the Mandalay Parking and hiking to the Mandalay Place is definitely a drawback compared to other restaurants.

    "text": "I give this place 2 stars for the following reasons. I rarely leave negative reviews, this is not a negative review, it's an attempt to tell management to wake up and start paying attention to the details. the owner \"or name\" attached to this place as a celebrity Chef means very little to me as the following points are well deserved comments. 1. Why do you serve a pickle spear on top of the lettuce tomato onion? Who wants to eat a pickle spear? This should be 3-4 dill pickle chips so that the sourness complements the burger in every other way. 2. Why is the lettuce soggy and setting on the side on a piece of paper tray cover?  Your line cooks miss this fine detail that lettuce is washed in cold water and slapped dry to stay crisp. 3. Good job on the thin sliced red onions, every one thick slices the onion and it ruins the burger. 4.  Your skinny fries suck.  If in-n-out can make fresh fries so can you.  Also I notice you use \"stealth\" or \"coated \" fries to make them stay crispy longer.  Whiskey Tango Foxtrot!  Your little square paper bags are nothing more than portion control tools. 5. Whats with the funky square metal tin trays? It looks cool and gastro-pubby but it's just another way some bean counter at corporate figured out that tin flat trays are cheaper than plates. And they don't break. Buy some plates. 6.  Your prices are beyond fair. $11-12 for a burger and fries well done. Nice location. Nice ambiance, I like the beer coolers with glass doors.  Your beer taps should be behind the counter on the wall.  Shorter runs, less waste, less foam, also you increase seating at the bar. 7.  This is good and bad.  Thank you for linen and nice silverware.  Next time can i have my silverware roll before I eat half my burger and have to ask the guy next to me for some paper cocktail napkins to wipe my face? 8.  I don't expect you to change anything because I like the place, but alot of people notice this stuff and you should be better.",

    "text": "Burger Bar is my #1 place to eat gourmet burgers on the strip. It's hard to find any other place that compares to Hubert Keller's burger joint. Main reason is the vast customization of burgers and drinks.  Deciding what type of bun, meat, condiment, sauce, and sides to get can get overwhelming, same scenario with the drinks.  Luckily, they have the Chef burgers, the one that I like is the Hubert Keller Burger. Consists of  Buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach and blue cheese on ciabatta bun served with red wine and shallots sauce.  The flavors are balanced very well, and the buffalo tasted fantastic it did't taste gamy or have that earthy after taste.  Next time I go I want to try the Rossini burger (Kobe Wagyu Beef from Austraila), it's $60 which is insane but one time should be enough.  My waitress was very kind and helpful, customer service is great here. The prices are steep from a ordinary burger perspective but these not regular burgers they are over the top, creates the best experience.",

I'm not going to explain the entire menu but we began with the Jalapeno Onion Pedals and Zucchini Fries. Man were they delicious. They sound like typical bar food, but these were done right. Perfectly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. Not too greasy and not a hint of sogginess.   I opted for the \"build your own burger\" option.  Chose the Angus Beef, sesame seed bun; topped with: smoked gouda, bacon, over easy egg, lettuce, tomato, onion, and of course TUFFLE MAYO. The truffle mayo was absolutely amazing and is a MUST when you check it out. It takes a special kind of mayo for me to dip my fries in there. I've never in my life dipped my fries in mayo... but I wiped that shit clean.   My girl got the same except Ciabatta bread and caramelized onions. Instead of the mayo she got the Chipotle Aioli. Also very good.   Lastly, I got the Vanilla Shake with Heath bar and Cookie Dough. The shake was really good as well. I'm not a big shake person and honesty I can't remember the last time I've had a shake... but this one was definitely memorable.",

The tv's aren't of any particular interest, they had only two channel, sports and one that displayed some facts about the music currently playing.  Service was exceptional. Our server was very pleasant and attentive, even with the busy lunch crowd.  As for the food it was simple, but it was very good. They have a large variety of shakes, and the mmHg nutella shake was delicious.  I had the buffalo burger in the plain bun. The meat portion was generous and not really seasoned, which allowed for the buffalo meat's strong flavor to be the focal pount. My wife had the chicken sandwich and the chicken was tender and juicy.  The onion rings we were unimpressive, very traditional and bland.   In addition to the onion rings , the only other complaint is the upcharge for additions like cheese and bacon, only because the burgers are so expensive to begin with. With an $18 price tag for a burger, having to pay extra for a slice of cheddar or a couple of slices of bacon seemed like a silly cash grab.",

    "text": "It was late Friday night and we were tired and hungry from walking all day along the strip. We were staying at the Delano so we didn't want to go far and found this restaurant still open in Mandalay Bay Shops. Owned by Hubert Keller, he is infamous in SF for his restaurant, Fleur de Lys (which recently closed) and for being on several shows such as Top Chef, Top Chef Masters, Top Chef All Stars, Top Chef Just Desserts and Secrets of a Chef (his own cooking show). It has a dark bar atmosphere with very dim lighting. The booths also have their own little TVs that you can change.  Note: the pricing and some items on their website is different than on their menus.  Our order: Rossini: ($65) Kobe Style Wagyu Beef w/ sauteed Foie Gras and shaved Truffles on an Onion Bun w/ a Black Perigord Truffle Sauce Build-your-own: (Total - $27.60) Buffalo Burger ($17.95) on a Pretzel Bun (+$1.50) Pepper Jack (+$1) Fried Egg ($1.95) Grilled Onion (+$1) BB Ketchup (+$0.95) Skinny Fries (+$3.25) Pink Monkey: ($8.75) Strawberry Ice Cream, fresh Banana & Strawberries topped w/Whipped Cream and added Malibu Banana (+$5.50) Crabbie Shake: ($11.50) Crabbies Ginger Beer served with a scoop of Lemon Sorbet and shaved Candied Ginger  The kobe beef is ground in-house so I had my burger medium rare. It was very tender and juicy. Loved how much of the truffle you could taste and smell. My friend really enjoyed his burger and was moaning with each bite he took.  Both of the shakes were sweet, bursting with flavor, and as yummy as they sounded. Definitely order one w/ your meal if you opt to come here.  The burgers and drinks were really good. Were they worth the hefty price tag? Not really. Especially since everything is nearly nickle-and-dimed if you're not just getting a plain burger and the items on the menu increased in price (i.e. sauces increased by a dime, the Rossini Burger was prior $60 instead of the $65, several of the other burgers increase by $3-4 as well, etc).  Service was decent. They only dropped off food and refilled our water so nothing to praise or complain.",

    "text": "Ordered the sliders (order comes with 3). The menu described them as pretty straightforward; plain bun, pickle, American cheese, onion and bacon. I wasn't expecting anything gargantuan (I mean, they are sliders), but the sliced pickle was literally the same circumference as the pattie. Okay, I'll give you that not every slider can be the same size as one served on a Hawaiian roll, but the thing that bothered me most was that the bun was a bit hard (by design) and dry. Just about every quality slider I've ever come across has a soft bun. The others in our group seemed to have average things to say about the burgers.   Heads up, the fried pickles are pickle spears, not slices.   They have several cuts and varieties of fries. The skinny fries had good crispness but not a ton of flavor. The onion rings were spot on. Great crunch, batter to onion ratio, and used an actual onion.   Milkshakes had pretty good feedback. They definitely looked the part.   All in, I would recommend another burger joint if you are able to locate one close by. Not hateful, but not worth the price.",

Since I am a pescatarian I absolutely LOVE the build your burger with the grilled salmon on a potato bun with avocado, three types of cheeses, grilled onions, lettuce, and pickles with a side order of fat fries, YUMMY!!! I was just here on Tuesday and was in seventh heaven, even had an adult milkshake to start my vacation off to a fabulous start!!  UNFORTUNATELY, they changed the menu on yesterday and I am extremely dissatisfied and disappointed! Why change something that was not broken?!?!? They took off the potato  bun and some other fabulous items. As a result of the new menu, I am now seriously thinking of changing my tradition and  not returning to this establishment. Management, if you are only able to make one change to the menu,  please, please please, put the potato bun back on the menu!!!",

Kinda weird that it's in a mall (and we sat right by the door so it was kinda noisy/distracting). Place filled up quick for lunch - we got there right when they opened. They had a great craft beer selection and I liked that I could get a pretzel bun! Place is kinda pricey and TBH, overrated. The veggie burger wasn't great - it was dry, crumby, fell apart, hard to eat, and quite bland. This place is highly touted for doing burgers the right way but I didn't see it. I'd go somewhere else next time (Grilled Cheese at In-N-Out anyone?!?).",

    "text": "I've been wanting to check out Burger Bar for months!! My husband and I had a rare night off together, and decided to try a restaurant locally we've never tried before. Burger Bar was our pick! It's tucked into the Mandalay Place shopping area of Mandalay Bay but you forget about that once you're inside. The hostesses were friendly and cheerful, and it was only a 5 minute wait on a Saturday night, which wasn't bad at all!   The booths are comfortable, which are fitted with a small television so you can watch whatever sports. It has a generic black button underneath which can be utilized to change the channels, but it was broken so we couldn't change the channel.  They have an AMAZING beer selection, and we opted for Magic Hat #9 which was shockingly on draft. Magic Hat is our favorite brew, aside from Dog Fish Head.  The husband ordered the Hubert Keller Burger which is buffalo, caramelized onions, baby spinach, blue cheese on a ciabatta bun. The hubby was a little thrown off by the ciabatta bun, but it complemented the ingredients perfectly and he had zero complaints. The fries are fresh and not too greasy and tasted unlike any fries we've ever tasted, which is a good thing!  I ordered the \"Perfect 10\" burger, which is BBQ Marinated Beef with smoked gouda, carmelized onions on a fresh pretzel bun, and it came with fries and a pickle slice. I love that they serve it with the onion on the side to give me the option of using it or not. To be honest, the burger didn't even need it. It was perfectly cooked to my requested medium-well temperature. The BBQ flavor was smokey with a dash of sweet and satisfied all of my taste buds!   The burgers are way filling, so if you're not too hungry, they DO have a slider option that I had been considering prior to making my order.   The server was sweet and friendly, giving us enough space to enjoy the meal but checking in at appropriate intervals without seeming like she was hovering.   The total cost between our beers and burgers was $62 and change. It's a bit pricey for us to go all the time, but it makes for a GREAT date night and the quality of what you get is definitely worth the cost.",

The Vegas Vegan is a big stack of grilled veggies that may look like a burger set-up, but there is no way you are picking it up and eating it with your hands. The tomatoes alone are almost 2 in. thick and stuffed with chopped garlic. I ate the whole thing - garnish and all - with a fork. Our server confirmed that the fried pickles, french fries, skinny fries, and sweet potato fries are all vegan too. An order of fried pickles has about 5-6 spears and they are spicy.",

The wings looked a lot fancier than what I'm used to but they were wonderful and I loved the fries here as well.  Combined with the sauces, my food was perfect.  Burger Bar is a great and satisfying place to eat, the food itself deserves high praise, but the service downs the overall rating.  The only thing I didn't enjoy too much was that our waiter seemed to take awhile to come make his rounds and especially to come bring us our check.  I don't know if they were understaffed that day for waiters but I wish the service was more on point and attentive.  I can't wait to come back and try the burgers, but dreading the possibility of subpar service.",

I had a kaiser roll, lamb, egg, bacon, chipotle aioli, and avocado.  The burger was cooked to a perfect medium! I like that you can choose anything from high quality beef/buffalo to turkey or salmon. You name the protein and it's there! They even have veggie options for those non-meat eaters (should they exist).

I love the space :-)  It's located on the way to Mandalay Place and offers a lot of seating!  The two toned walls and low lighting offer a very intimate setting for any type of party.  The back light on both bars and marble table tops really makes this place feel high end.    I really like the menu.  They have everything, for the vegetarian appetite, the vegan appetite and of course the carnivore appetite.  Tonight I got that grilled chicken Caesar salad for $8.50 + $3.50.  Super affordable for being on the strip!  I also got the Miller Lite pint for $5.75.  I thought the Miller Lite was a little stale but still did the trick.  My salad, though, was on point!  Romaine hearts, shaved Parmesan cheese, croutons and of course, tossed with Caesar dressing.  The dressing was lightly coated, not too powerful.  The Parmesan cheese was thinly shaved and packed a nice punch!  The croutons were in long strips of crusted toast, which you would crumble over the salad.  I thought the chicken was grilled perfectly!  It was seasoned well and they gave A LOT!    Definitely a must try, even if you're not a burger enthusiast.  If you are, you'll be in heaven!  Dress up, dress down it doesn't matter.  Prices are affordable and will certainly put a smile on your face!",

First problem was the $7 fee for 'self-park', then it was quite a walk (probably 10 minutes at least) to get to this restaurant.  When the waitress guessed we weren't ready to order, she took her time in coming back to the table, after that the service was good.  Next problem was they don't serve any COCA-COLA products.  Two burgers (one deluxe w/ fries) a Dr Pepper & their \"house\" milkshake came to $56 (plus another $7 for the parking, and after that a \"tip\") -- it would've been about $13 at IN 'N OUT burger and I like the burgers there better than this upscale joint.  Strictly a tourist trap as far as I'm concerned.  You'd do better taking the same money and putting into action at one of the dice games in the casino.  Oh, they did have a good TV set-up though.",

Sadly, I hadn't and really really wanted to.  I fell for the hype pre Hubert Keller Top Chef association.  I have to say our large party had a good variety of burgers to nom on including a salmon burger, buffalo, portabello. However my choice of going with the Kobe beef burger was, eh, just okay. It wasn't dry but flavorless. I've had better burger's elsewehere. Points for their beer selection, quick seating and their fries- crisp, nicely seasoned with your choice of dipping sauce. You can't go wrong with their aioli.",

The incredible service began with Lisa and the pre-planning process. She set expectations right from the start, made the reservation process seamless, and everything she promised was fulfilled the day of the event (down to the personalized menus she created).  On the day of, we received amazing service. The two servers that catered to our 40+ party were efficient, fast, and very accommodating. They took extra care to make sure that our questions were answered and that each of our guests received personal treatment. They even went the extra mile to serve the cupcake tier that we had pre-delivered to the restaurant.  And of course, who could forget the food! From the Buffalo Burger and the Cobb Salad to the Crabby Patty kids burger, everything we ate was delicious (you have to get the spicy mustard!). I would recommend Burger Bar to any group big or small. You can't go wrong.",

    "text": "At $22 or $17 for a burger and fries, I was expecting a great burger, not merely a good burger.  The \"Hubert Keller\" buffalo burger came with a tasty red wine reduction sauce, but the burger already soaked through the rustic ciabatta bun and made it impossible to add without completely disintegrating the bun. The burger also came with grilled onions and cooked spinach which were flavorful, but there were too much of them. Because of the toppings, the Keller burger had nice flavors that are atypical of a burger. It reminded me of a French dip sandwich more than a burger which isn't necessarily bad.  The Keller burger was better than the \"Blackjack\" burger. The Blackjack burger was too small to fit the ciabatta bun. The key flavor of the burger was the olive tapenade and also had jack cheese. Lettuce, red onion, and sliced tomato are on the side which I added to the burger, but should I really need to assemble my own meal? A pickle is also on the side, but it's a spear, not sliced. Good luck putting that on your burger. It's questionable if the pickle was house made or bought from a purveyor.  The kitchen had trouble with their cooking temps. The medium-ordered buffalo burger was medium-rare. The rare angus burger was unevenly cooked with one-half medium-rare and some parts medium. Whatever beef blend they are using, it didn't bring out the flavor of the meat.  Although called \"skinny\" fries on the menu, they are classic-cut bistro fries, not shoestring skinny. The fries had a thick crust which reduced the inner potato fluffiness, but they were less greasy than most.  I was a bit shocked that a Hubert Keller restaurant would staff and dress their waitresses like a Hooters. The waitresses clearly don't eat the burgers here.  During a slow time of year in Vegas, the restaurant was busy and required a 10 minute wait to get a table. Even though this is a burger bar, many customers had salads for lunch. The online sample menu is woefully small compared to the real menu with an endless number of choices including the ability to add truffles to any burger. Because these casino resorts are a Byzantine maze, the restaurant can be found in the Mandalay Bay Place shopping area.",

    "text": "Unlike most of the places I review on this blog, Burger Bar is a place I can write a review on based strictly on memory. Still, given the opportunity a few days ago to stop in there for lunch I didn't hesitate. Besides, I didn't have any quality pictures to post until that point.  Because I've been here so many times I was almost nervous that I would give this restaurant preferential treatment, but since I've been taking a way more analytical approach to my burgers lately I found that Burger Bar wasn't quite the perfection I remembered it.  But it was still close.  Located in the elusive Mandalay Place shopping area connecting Mandalay Bay and the Luxor, Burger Bar is placed amongst overly expensive clothing stores, men's shaving boutiques and some other more touristy shops of late. The restaurant has been there for quite a few years now and is maybe looking slightly dated, but it's still a good atmosphere. It's very open pretty much anywhere you sit, even in the booths, so don't go there if you're looking for a decent amount of privacy. Also if you're going on the weekend, or even potentially during a weekday lunch, expect a wait or try the bar.  Other than a small selection of slightly overpriced burgers, the menu is pretty much do-it-yourself. You have your choice of meats; Angus, country natural, Kobe and buffalo, along with chicken, salmon turkey and veggie if you're into that sort of thing. While the Kobe is totally delicious, I find it to be a bit expensive and have been completely happy ordering the Angus. But more on that shortly. Once you've chosen your meats, you have a very long list of choices for veggies, cheeses, meats, sauces and plenty of other fancy things. I've had quite a few different burgers over the years, and all of the toppings have been great.  For this particular meal I went with the Angus, Swiss cheese, and mushrooms on a sesame bun. Fairly simple, but that's fine because the meat always stands out as a great flavor on its own. One of the biggest things I can say about this restaurant is that however you order your burger it will always come out that way. Consistency is key, and they never disappoint. I ordered medium-rare, and it's as pink as it could be. And like I said, the meat really has great flavor, so whether you have a ton of toppings or almost none, you're guaranteed a great burger. After eating a lot of others around town lately, I could say that this burger might be lacking a bit of seasoning now, almost as if the burger is outdated like the restaurant. Still it is fantastic and won't disappoint.  The various buns I have had are always good, no matter which one you get there seems to be a proper meat to bun ratio. The mushrooms were flavorful, and just the right amount. My cheese was melted as always, the lettuce and tomato on the plate were also very fresh. I haven't always been a fan of pickles in the past, but they're growing on me with all these burger meals so now it's a welcome sight on my plate.  The fries are the one slight weak spot in this meal; my skinny fries were just ok, a bit too generic for such a fancy menu. The sweet potato fries have been really good in the past, especially with some ranch, although it's been a while since I've had them. I'm not always a fan of fat fries, but they're a little better here so you might want to try them when visiting.  My burger, fries and drink came to almost $19; I would consider that a bit on the high side if it wasn't in a very touristy spot on the strip. I'm not always too happy about spending that much on a burger meal anywhere, but compared to Bradley Ogden or even BLT this is a huge value for the same price. This place is still one of my favorite choices in town based on the burger alone, so do yourself a favor and check it out.",

I have to agree that melts in your mouth and is very tender.  I went crazy and customized it by adding bacon and pepperjack cheese... and boy that really did hit the spot.

Unfortunately, lady luck wasn't on my side, so I wasn't able to splurge on the gold flake-encrusted beef (just kidding, but what a thought), so I opted for the more affordable $9 burger.  That was some good cow!  Mine was cooked to a perfect medium-well, and I chose carmelized onions, provolone, and bacon for my add-ons.  Each add-on was $1 extra.  Those were the sweetest, most tender onions I've ever tasted.   MMMMMMMM!  I had the sweet potato skinny fries, a great alternative to the usual white potato.  Service was a bit on the slow side, as I was looking for my waiter a few times.  But friendly and forgivable, because he always qualified the slow service due to how busy they were at the time.

After getting a recommendation for this place from my Boss, the Hubs and I decided to give it a whirl during our recent getaway to Vegas.  The place was packed and there was an hour and a half wait... that tells you all you need to know. Not only is the food great, but the service we received from the bartenders was amazing.  For appetizer we shared the pepper jack cheese shots, which were basically fried cheese balls.  As one would guess, they were fabulous.  The only thing that would have made them better was some kind of sauce, but they were gone so fast there wasn't any time to get some!  For our entree, we shared the buffalo burger with blue cheese.  FABULOUS!  Having never tried buffalo before, we decided to be adventurous and give it a go... so glad we did.  It was moist and flavorful and the au jus it was served with was the perfect touch.  The fries, which it came with were really good as well.  We were offered dessert, but passed, however my Husband made a comment about the beer floats (thought it was intriguing) and the bartender proceeded to give us a free small sample.  It was soooo... good... raspberry beer with vanilla ice cream - it rocks!  The Burger Bar is a fun, happening place, which serves a mean burger that lives up to the popularity.  My Husband is STILL talking about his meal and that beer float.  I think we will be back for sure!",

I am a vegetarian and don't eat much dairy...the server was quick to come up with something delicious to fit my needs. Not an upscale place by any means, but good food at the right price on the Strip! The boyfriend said the milkshakes are phenom too! :)",

However the smaller selection of chef's burgers provided a number of choices without all the planning. The classic \"wedge salad\" is always good to see on a menu and this one is quite well done. My American Classic burger was cooked perfectly but arrived a bit soon after the salad and the bun was overly soggy. Still, a great choice for beer and burgers.",

I was at the Burger Bar last year with a couple of buddies and I told them that I would get them all the Rossini Burger if I won big.  Well, I won big... So big that I was ready to purchase 4 Rossinis.  But these foolios declined.  Well, their loss.  So instead, they settled for the Kobe Beef Burger.  Juicy, tender, cooked to your liking, add some cheese and bacon, a side of onion rings, and an ice cold beer... what more could you ask for?!?!",

Maybe it is because they have a really good beer selection which includes this awesome IPA called Piraat, that I am on a quest to find now. Maybe if they served you the Piraat in a quiet waiting area you would be more inclined to nurse your multi-substance hangover while you waited for your table, instead of grabbing a beer to go and skipping the food altogether.

I have seen his over the top, expensive burger in his other restaurant, I just knew he would be able to pull it off. After just having two over priced dry sliders at Holsteins Burgers, I did not want to consume any more beef. I was surprised Burger Bar offered a salmon burger. I ordered it cooked well done, which worried me, I believed it would be dry flaky salmon. When the burger arrived, to my surprise the salmon steak was very thick. I was expecting more of a salmon patty. It was perfectly cooked and seasoned, I dove right in. I ordered it with garlic aioli, spinach, and avocados. The bread was the perfect thickness to contain the juiciness of the salmon. The fries were also amazing, fresh and lightly seasoned. Nothing like Holstein's potato twigs. To add the the amazing food, the service was spot on. The server was attentive and polite. There was absolutely nothing wrong with his restaurant. I could find no critique. I would be happy to go again and have a different burger and try one of his shakes. I did not get to try a shake because I had a Mai tai, which tasted very sweet and then punched you with the rum.",

He went in with an eye for making sure they weren't better than his, but I knew he liked it as much as I did.  It's a bit difficult to find, as we made many circles around the casino trying to figure out where to go. It's in kind of an odd location across from a shoe store in the shops at Mandalay Bay. It was worth the search.  I had the black angus beef cooked medium with caramelized onion, portobello mushrooms, prosciutto and monterey jack cheese on an onion bun. The meat was a bit too red for me, but it was still yummy. I didn't eat the whole thing (made for a great drunken snack later that night.)  The service was decent, but the burgers and beer were excellent. I liked the TVs at each booth, only we didn't know how to change the channel. Overall fabulous experience.",

It was good not GREAT but good. The meat was very flavorful and the fixings didn't overpower. It was a little on the chincy side to split. We also shared zucchini fries. Those were to die for. Crispy thin cut pieces of fried zucchini dipped in ranch.      The service was great. We talked to the GM and he was super helpful and suggested some really good places for dinner.

Having went to Fleur de Lys the day after, I wish I would've went to Fleur de Lys twice (though, my pocketbook probably couldn't have taken it =P).  As for the Burger Bar, I decided to go for the Hubert burger - trust the chef, right? It was a buffalo burger with spinach, bleu cheese, and grilled onions on a ciabatta bun. Was it a good burger? Yes and no... I mean, it was pretty much just a burger. I thought the spinach was a little weird and the bleu cheese was a bit over the top. The prices, too, were a little high.   I was amazed at their beer selection - they actually have a whole menu dedicated to beers - and they have choices from around the world. I went for the Burger Bar Seasonal since it was something brewed right in Vegas. It was ok - a bit sweet.   Overall a bit pricey for burgers billed as \"fancy\" - but worth a try. I'd definitely try Fleur de Lys SF before Burger Bar SF.",

We ended up wandering around the area and going to that overpriced sock store close to there.  I played it safe and got the All-American Burger.  Perhaps it was TOO safe.  It was good but it wasn't too remarkable.  Our table also ordered some pitchers of beer- I think I had some of the Hef.  I don't remember drinking that much and I think it was just alright.   Props to their sweet potato fries though- they were pretty good.

First off the hostess (and I use the term lightly)  who I walked up to and tried to ask if they had any seats looked at me and turned away. Literally...its like she had seen an ex boyfriend or something and did her best to basically treat me like vapor. I was the only person in line to boot so there's no excuse for that lack of service. Luckily her nicer counterpart standing next to her helped me out (gee customer service, what a concept) and told me the wait time and that I could take the option to sit at the bar, which I did. The bar staff was great and made small talk with me. Very attentive and hospitable. Those guys earn their paychecks. Unlike that hostess who needs some work. Btw...that hostess was the only staff there dressed like she was going to go clubbing too...maybe she wanted to go to LAX down the way and decided to dress up early and put on her \"I'm not a piece of meat\" look but still ogle me anyways face on.  The burgers here are still top notch...but the last few visits here there's always some glitch with their customer service either lacking or not telling me something which could've saved me some grief.",

    "text": "If the hostess says there's a 20 min. wait at 3:30pm, make sure you go in and scope the place out.  $50 says that the girl's flexing her fancy-burger-joint attitude and the restaurant's half empty.  Sit down at a table and ask a deserving waitress for some menus.  Service aside, this place is solid.  Huge juicy burgers in a down-to-earth sports bar, plopped casually in the middle of a mall inside Mandalay Place.  It doesn't try too hard and it isn't commercialized.  Great hearty shakes, sides, and desserts to match.  ++ | Any Beef Burger | (though I'd pass on the one w/foie) Mounding on tons of extras - sprouts, portabello, cheese, sauce, etc. - is a MUST.  ++ | Banana Split | Delish! Choc/Vanilla/Strawberry over a banana with plenty of cherries, strawberries, fudge, whip cream.  It's enough to serve 4.  Decent sides: Sweet potato fries - a bit on the skinny & over-fried side, but it works Zucchini Fries - A heavy thick winter coat of deep-fried batter keeps the zucchini wedge inside moist and juicy.  Average burger = $15-20",

Burgers were disappointing, also didn't like that you had to pay for any dipping sauces for the appetizers.  Sweet potato fries were very good and the speed of service was good.",

    "text": "Love the concept of this place.   You basically build your own burger and then can choose from many different types of fries, milkshakes or beers to go along with it.  Have been here a few times and always pay a few bucks extra and get the Kobe beef burger.   I also added sauteed mushrooms and onions (Note:  each topping other than the regular lettuce, ketchup, mustard, etc.  costs extra).    The burger is very tasty but will run you about $25 to $30 (I must say I have had $10 burgers just as good but hey it is Vegas).   For a side, I recommend either the sweet potato fries or the shoestring fries as both are very good.",

    "text": "Really good burgers. My husband and I have decided to try burgers at different hotels and we are glad to have tried this place. I had the Vegas Vegan which I know isnt a \"burger' but it sounded so good I had to try it. Portabello mushrooms and eggplant,yummy. My husband went for the Peppercorn burger and enjoyed it as well. Service was very good. Kinda loud but  not obnoxious. Good beer as well.I am confused by some reviews that say this is near the pool, it isnt. this is located in the Shoppes between Mandalay and Luxor, maybe the reviews are getting combined?",
