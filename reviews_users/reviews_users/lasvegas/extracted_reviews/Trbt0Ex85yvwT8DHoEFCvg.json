My mom and brother got the salmon, I got a caesar salad, and a sesame tuna appetizer. The fish was all delicious! There were these crunchy things on top of the salmon that were especially good. No idea what they were. The salad was also ok, but after tasting my family's fish I wanted to get that instead. Unfortunately we were short on time before a show we were going to, so we didn't have time.   The server wasn't my favorite. She took forever, forreals... and it wasn't busy at all.  Even so, I wanna try this place again. I want more fish dishes and to try some of the drink deals!",

I'm not going to report this to our credit card, the amounts are so small - but I wonder if they're cheating a few cents here and a few cents there from everyone.  That sum would quickly add up.

The service was pretty good, attentive but kind of slow/lack of help.. Our waitress was very sweet and accommodating though!  The food was mediocre. The price definitely relates to the quality, less than $22 of anything on the menu.   I tried some of the calamari, a bit chewy and the batter on it was rather bland and soggy.   For dinner I had the Cajun chicken pasta, which was a bit dried out. It kind of tasted like it had been sitting under a heat lamp and the sauce lost its texture.  Others had a similar experience, I heard the best dishes of the group were the filet and the salmon (although sauce was a bit sweet).",

    "text": "Prelims: a surprisingly roomy sit-down restaurant located in the middle of Planet Hollywood's mile of shopping, this place is nicely decorated, bringing recollections of pictures seen of the old days of Greece, but not the ancient Greeks, the more contemporary ones with a hearkening back to the old days. Anyways, service was great. Our server (who happened to serve my wife last time she was here a while's way back - small world...or planet...bahahaha) was quick, on point with all the food, and he accepted our lunch order even though we were 15 minutes before lunch hour officially started. The price: $5. Per. Dish. It's an epic conflagration of great food with good service at an unbelievable, fantastic, jaw-dropping price of epicness.  We ordered the calamari appetizer. Because it was five bucks. My expectations were low. Because it was five dollars. It came out and the crunchy breading with the deliciously soft calamari and acidity of the marina sauce was great - probably better than most places that I've eaten at in Vegas. Because it only cost me five moolah. I got the flank steak. Which only cost me cinco dinero (hope I got that right). Combined with the sauce, some asparagus, and mashed potatoes, it was a delicious and I thoroughly enjoyed it, despite that it came out medium rather than medium rare. But I'm not complaining because it cost five greenbacks.   My wife got the chicken Caesar salad and somehow got full off salad which seems impossible to me. And the dough necessary for payment was five. So this whole delicious escape from the mile strip of people hawking at you to buy stuff that you don't want but feel like you need because it's thrust into your face cost me only $20. AWESOMENESS.  TL;DR $5 footlong - but replace footlong with a sit down restaurant menu at lunch.",

I took my mom to Vegas for mothers day, and after spending days here, it took quite a toll on our bank accounts, especially due to all the restaurants. On our last day here, we decided to walk through the miracle mile shops and came across this little place. We looked at the menu posted in front of the restaurant and decided that this was definitely where we should have lunch  Upon coming in, the staff was friendly and the place was pretty nice. Nicer than usual restaurants in the mall.  We ordered the calamari to start off and it was delicious. The squid was properly seasoned and very crispy. The portion was huge and only $5. That's cheaper than so many places and that's saying a lot since I live near Galveston.   For the main meal, I ordered the ahi tuna wrap thinking it would be good at all. It was great. The fish wasn't extremely fresh, but it was not too bad. After all, it was only $5. My mom ordered the salmon and she loved it as well.   For drinks. The prices were out of this world. 3 drinks for $10? How is that possible? The daiquiris and Pina coladas were $3 each. I ordered a daiquiri and my mom the Pina colada. The drinks were good, not too boozy but alright for $3.   I would definitely come here again when I'm back in Vegas. The prices can't be beat.",

The first time I found this hidden gem was when my boyfriend and I went on a mini vacation to Las Vegas because he's never been and we honestly were tired of walking around to find food, and lets be honest, most girls are very indecisive when it comes to where to eat but this place literally has EVERYTHING! I recently went to Vegas for my friends birthday ( this was a Saturday) we Had a party of 8 and we were seated within 5 mins! the 3 for 10 drinks are actually LEGIT! no catch whatsoever(try a mimosa with Cranberry juice instead of the typical OJ & The Hawaiian Cosmo) ! The salmon on the lunch menu is AMAZING!! I'm craving it as I type lol. The southwest salad Is also to die for! I hope this place never goes away!!",

I checked the board to see if they just gave up on cleaning and it said no one had cleaned since 4 pm.   My food was ok, good portion size, but not the greatest flavor or presentation. I had the pasta primavera with shrimp. The only positive was our server, Anthony, he was super nice and attentive. He gets five stars on his own. That, plus the negative 3 stars for the restaurant equals 2.",

I mean come on it's Vegas if you can't get your \"meal\" in form of a shot or a drink you're doing something wrong, right?!  Well we were out in Vegas for my cousin's 21st and happened upon Ocean One Bar & Grille one afternoon upon seeing the happy hour special posted out front - 2 for 1s.  Ohhh yeah music to my ears...err wait beauty to my eyes!  We sat at the bar which had several people already there, all of who I will say did have food and it looked and smelled amazing.  The waitress promptly greeted us and offered us up menus to see what we could get for happy hour, which was pretty much everything!  From margaritas to martinis to pina coladas!  Also, she let us know that you can mix and match your 2 for 1.  I had to pinch myself to see if I was dreaming as this is usually not the case - especially in Vegas!  A couple of us opted for doubles instead of getting something different and man were they strong.  The regular drinks were also very good and you could tell there was actually alcohol in them - again not always the case with Vegas specials.  The waitress then starting to chit chat with us a bit and upon hearing we were celebrating a birthday offered said bday boy a free shot.  Again I was blown away by this as this is our third trip celebrating a family member's journey into the land of legal drinking and the FIRST time any bartender offered up a free anything.  We all had high hopes of going back to partake in some drinking here again but alas it did not happen however thanks to the great customer service and the buzz that kept us going for a few more hours...until our next stop!",

It's horrible.  First we ordered an appetizer.  Then I ordered the club sandwich.  Everything came out at the same time.  When the waiter put down my club sandwich I said \"oh that's not mine food, I ordered the club sandwich\". it was mine alright.  Their club is on a plain old hamburger bun with a plain full chicken breast, 2 slices of bacon then covered in a gob of greasy melted cheese.  It was a mess.  Not a fresh club sandwich.  It was disgusting.  I told the waiter that it wasn't a club sandwich and I didn't want it.  He told me too bad.  I ordered it and I had to take it.  Once food was ordered it couldn't be taken back.  Apparently that was the company policy. They don't waste food and his manager wouldn't allow it.  I asked to speak to the manager but he wasn't available and my waiter was the acting manager.  I left the sandwich untouched.   Also, watch out for the 2 for 1 drink special. Another ripoff.  My sister order a glass of chardonnay.  2 for 1, right?  Less than a 6oz pour of cheap table wine and charged $10. Oh, you get the second glass free, but the first one should have been a $3.00 glass of wine in the first place so how is that buy one get one free when both together should have been $6.00.  This place has bad food, bad customer service and is a ripoff.  I guess they think because their cliental is mostly tourists they can get by with this.  So move on hungry folks.  There's so many wonderful restaurants in Vegas and Miracle Mile.  Let places like this go away.",

We had a late lunch/dinner around 4pm, with shrimp pasta, grilled chicken club, fried calamari, salmon and house salad and really enjoyed our meal.  Everything was delicious, and not just because we were hungry, and very reasonably priced, since they were still serving the lunch menu.  The water, until the ice melted, tasted a bit strange though.  The service was good!",

First time I went it was myself and my pops and I we both had the French toast which was REALLY GOOD!!! with scramble eggs and sauage...no complaints for $5.99! SO the next morning I dragged myself out of bed and went back for another great breakfast but the only difference was the service was very poor which was crazy being I was there by myself there wasn't much for the waiter to do! I found myself waiting for a refill on Apple Juice that I desperately needed after a long night of drinking, for 26 mins(YES I COUNTED!..lol) then when I was done with my meal I was once again waiting, and waiting for my check...30mins! really?! It crossed my mind to just walk out but I didn't want jail time added to my story of my bachelor party trip! So all in all good food, decent prices but a hit or miss on customer service...",

    "text": "I would avoid this place for dinner. We came for dinner and ordered the calamari for starters.  Main entree was fillet mignon and bone in steak. Special was 2 for 1 drinks. Calamari tasted stale like it had been sitting for some time. It came with some tomato based sauce that tasted something from a can. The steak was prepared as ordered, medium rare but was tough. Drinks came in small glasses and there was not much alcohol  in it. The two daiquiri came to $20. Calamari was $9. Steak and mignon added up to $42. Gratuity was automatically added which I do not agree with. What happens when service is bad?. Service was okay though. With taxes bill came to $90 for two. I think for this price there are better places to go. A good buffet at Ballagio for two is about $70 excluding tax and tips which would be a way better in terms of quality and deal.",

I think the decor of the place doesn't really match the menu....but, I guess it's Vegas right (it looks like it will be all nice and the menu is pretty generic). We got the spinach dip appetizer, which was fine. There was a lot of cheese...nothing spectacular about it. Had the Mahi sandwich, which was okay. My fish was overcooked and dry. The fires were okay. The sandwich was only 9 bucks, so I can't really complain. Not the best, but not the worst place if your looking for somewhere to stop without spending an arm and a leg.",

Dry and unseasoned. Everything was flavourless and dry. Like a lot of things in Vegas, it had the veneer of being a much nicer place than it was. Even cheaply priced, it wasn't worth it.",

(i've used plenty of these certificates with alchohol) and we ALWAYS TIP 25%+ (on the original) when using these... just for the record :)  We like them because it saves a few dollars, even after leaving a really great tip... we've both worked in the industry, and wont leave less than 25%... just dont treat us like shit!      We went in around 8ish... we wanted to get a few appetizers to try and some drinks..  We showed the bartender our certificate, and he says \"do you want a table?  you can't use that up here\"   .... ummm okay sure... he obviously (and rudely) didn't want to wait on us because we had a \"coupon.\"    We were taken to a table, and given a menu... the server says \"you can't use those certificates for alchohol\"  ... whaaaaat?  we looked at the menu and nothing was over the 9dollar range... meaning we'd both have to get entrees... an appetizer... maybe soup and/or salad and dessert??  lol... no way... i can't, nor want to, eat that much at 8pm...   The service, so far, was so rude.  My husband just wanted to leave and go somewhere else.  I didn't really wanna order a feast of food either... so we got up and left... without grabbing our certificate off the table... I figured it would just be thrown away anyway, and didn't plan on coming back.    So, i got an email this morning, from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>, asking how the experience at Ocean One was.  (this happens after the certificate is used, and validated.) ... so, apparently the server must have grabbed it , and used it the next time her table paid in cash (i guess if you had more than 2 ppl , you might get a check over $35)  Anyway, wouldn't that be theft?  I still PAID for that certificate, and could have traded it for a different one... or maybe come back when i had more ppl with us... (most likely, though, i would have just thrown it away, but its the point that the server would use a certificate that someone left behind on accident)  So, that thief server got an extra $25 for doing nothing (exept be rude to very awesome customers who tip really well!)",

The waiter said he didn't disclose it because customers get \"angry\" when he tells them up front, and it's their policy to charge for it. Angry? Customers get MORE angry when they are not given written and/or verbal notice. Customers need to know so they can aren't surprised by hidden charges!  The waiter wouldn't reverse the charges. An attitude of \"too bad, so sad.\" Because several of us had ordered hot water, on principle, we spoke with the manager. He again told us that it was their policy to charge for hot water.  We were told that they had a problem with people ordering hot water, and bringing their own tea. (Note: We did not bring tea).   It took 20 minutes from receiving the bill to talking to the manager before he eventually reversed the charge. Yes. It's an employee training issue, but the charge is exorbitant!! The whole experience was off putting because even the manager was initially unapologetic, and he seemed reluctant to reverse it...it's a strict restaurant policy he is following.  I don't mind the policy, just let me know up front so I have the option of saying \"no thanks.\"  Will I be back? After this, no thanks.",

In between your hundred dollar meals, you still need to eat, this is one of these hidden gems in Vegas where you can take the whole family and feast even if you're on a budget.  They have some amazing drink deals here, and the drinks are not water down and cheap like you might find at a hotel happy hour...solid drinks...Long Island iced tea anyone?  Everything on the menu is pretty good, and it is priced so well, you can't help but feel pretty good when you leave.   we stopped by here a bunch of times, for drinks, just to grab a quick snack when we didn't want to pay $50 for a quick snack, and just in between meals when we weren't that hungry and didn't need the absolute Gourmet stuff.  In a town where you can find a burger for a few dollars or a few hundred dollars, a place like this is much needed and it was situated perfectly just outside of our hotel in the Miracle Mile  Happy eating!",

At the bar you can get 3 mixed drinks for $10 BUTTTT I opted for cognac.. so that price was a little higher.. 3 for $14 still not bad of a price. During this time we also placed an order for food and ordered 3 meals for less than $15. I had the calamari, salmon salad and a Mahi Mahi burger that came with a side of fries. Out of all three meals, my fave would have to be the Salmon salad. The salmon was perfectly cooked, not too hard and it was seasoned just right. The dressing that came with it was a little sweet but it accented the Salmon just right.   The Calamari was ok, I wish the pieces were a little bigger. The Mahi Mahi burger was decent, I wasn't expecting it to have a curry flavor but it did. I wish they could have mentioned that on the description.. or maybe they did and just disregarded it. Anyway, I never had a curry burger before until now .. it wasn't bad, also the bun for the burger was a little too thick for me. It probably would have tasted better if it had the Filet o Fish type bun from McDonald's.   To end this.. I would def come back and order the salmon salad again :)",

I remember a few years ago this place didn't seem so busy, well they're busy now & rightfully so. The food is ridiculously inexpensive especially considering it's right on or off  \"depending on how you look at it\" the strip. Located in the Miracle Mile Shops. First the food, I had breakfast 3 days in a row, croissant breakfast sandwich,  steak & eggs and finally biscuits & gravy. That's called the vacation diet. Everything was good & the steak was cooked a perfect med/rare with quite a bit of seasoned flavor. Now the staff, I wouldn't be surprised if employees that busy were a little cranky but they all were very friendly, especially Lexi who was an absolute ray of sunshine! There is no question I'll be returning, did I forget to mention it's proximity to Elara Grand Vacations where I was staying. The only problem is this place isn't in my home town, with so much to do in Las Vegas you have to divide up your time. See you guys next year, maybe sooner",

So, my friends were like everything on the lunch menu is $4.99. I was like...What?!  Why have I never been here?!    So, lunch starts at 11:30am so make sure you get there at that time so you can get lunch. They are open for breakfast which look good too but that's for another review when I come back. :)  It's great when you come with friends because that means you get to try a bunch of stuff. Yay!  It's a win-win. :)  My entree: Orechiette Pasta - OMG! So good.  I'm not gonna lie.. originally, I wanted to order the penne pasta but our waiter convinced me to get this instead.  I know orechiette means (little) ears in Italian. Anyways, I didn't know what to expect...this had artichoke and chicken with a fresh lemon taste. So yummy!  My friends loved it too.  The portion was huge.   I tried: - crispy calamari: yum. can't go wrong.  I ate a lot of these suckers. No pun intended.  LOL - spinach & artichoke dip: No complaints. I'd eat this again. Ooey gooey goodness.  - lollipop chicken wings: these were ok. I probably wouldn't order these again. - herb crusted chicken chop: wow! I'd order this the next time I come here.  Now the best thing about this place...3 for 1 drinks for $10. LOL What's Vegas without a little indulgence?! It's 5 o' clock somewhere! :)  I can't wait to come back. Woohoo!",

Next I ordered coffee one cup had a lip Stick stain and the other had a coffee stain inside as if someone just finished drinking out of it needless to say I changed my order to water . The artichoke dip was cold and dry I guess this place is a \"you get what you pay for \" scenario because it is cheap .

I didn't plan to eat here but the Todai Korean Buffet was gone so I gave this place a try since I passed it by for years and years and it was nearby.  I figured for only $4.99 pricing the food might not be so great......or maybe very tiny portions.....?  I was WRONG. The food we tried was very ok and the portions were big!  We shared the Mahogany Glazed Wings. We received 8 wings that were tender, flavorful and juicy in a house made glaze that tasted sort of teriyaki-like to me. They were ok....  For lunch I ordered some sort of Salmon Salad. They ran out of Salmon and asked me if I wanted Chicken so I got that. The Salad was made with fresh greens, toasted pistachios and supreme oranges. My chicken was nicely grilled and the house made Mango dressing was delicious. All in all it was a pretty good salad that was cheap.  My husband had a pasta dish with chicken, artichokes and a tiny amount of spinach. It wasn't the best but it was ok......  Our waiter was attentive and efficient.  All in all the food was better than I expected it to be for the low pricing.",

I mean I knows it's Vegas but the prices here are getting absolutely ridiculous.  Anyway noticed the 3 cocktails for $10 you call it ALL DAY sign. I mean $3.33 grey goose & tonics, c'mon. I'll get drunk, in a mall, that looks like Morocco, where the ceiling is painted like sky, and it rains every hour on the hour! Now that Vegas! Sorry I digress.  So not wanting to buy ice cream using 2 credit cards, we noticed that all their lunch items were $4.99. Looking at yelp first noticed general satisfaction, in addition to guests leaving and complementing their experience. So we got ourselves an outside? Inside table. Unsure how that terminology works in a mall. My son got the quesadilla, wife got a $3 pina coloda and chicken tacos and I got a Greek chicken salad. For $15 you can't beat it. Food was great, it is value based so keep that in mind, our server was sweet, friendly and accommodating. SO REMEMBER TO TIP BIG. These folks are working as hard as the everyone else at the other restaurants, but saving u money. I would definitely hit this place again. The wraps and other apps looked pretty good at other tables.",

That charge was hidden between the other plate charges and the taxes, so we didn't notice until after we applied another 15% tip.

Plenty of other great servers out there that don't try to cheat your customers.",

Saw a lot of people eating breakfast the next morning there, might give that a try.",

One of the most affordable spots to eat at one the strip - you'll get better deals here than from any fast food joint.   Whether you're on a budget or not, definitely stop by here for their awesome deals. Lunch plates are always $4.99 and you can get different deals for drinks - the best one is 3 for $10 cocktails/wine.   I've tried their spinach artichoke dip, fried calamari and quesadilla as an appetizer. All delicious. For an entree, I always order the chicken with orecchiette pasta. All the portions are good and more than worth their price tag counterpart.   If you're looking for cheap drinks specials or some good deals on grub, stop on by!",

I cant forget to mention that they served the creamer to our coffee in a gravy boat...HAHA, really?  All I can say is the food is not worth the wait.  There was nothing wrong with it for us....it just took an hour to actually get to us.  Mind you, the restaurant was half empty.  Not once did the server check on us...he actually disappeared for a bit.  Someone else was nice enough to refill our water and coffee.    And after we sat at an empty table for 20 minutes, asked a bus boy, asked a server, and asked our own server twice did we actually get a check.   Not impressed with this Vegas breakfast at all - room service would have been better...",

Forgot the dude's name but our shady punk server (name started with a \"K\") tried to slip one past us by charging $2 for hot water (called Flavor Shot on the receipt), and conveniently including gratuity for a party of three!!!    What happened was, I handed him my credit card thinking the bill was a bit high, but decided to check the receipt after.  When he brings my credit card receipt, the itemized bill magically disappears.  I ask for the receipt and find the $2 charge for hot water and gratuity has been automatically included.  His explanation was that when you order more than 6 total items, the computer reads it as being a party of six.  REALLY??? STFU, right???  Asked for the manager, and literally about 10 min. later, some jackass working the bar, is supposed to be the supervisor.  Just the same unapologetic ass pretending to be the manager, with the same sorry excuses.    Long story short, had him redo my bill and forgot to tip him.  So here's a tip: \"Don't try to screw over your customers, scumbag!\"",

My cousin ordered this the second time we came here and after telling me she didn't like it, I took a bite and it wasn't very tasty.

    "text": "You can't expect much given the prices on the menu, so I would say that Ocean meets expectations.  Food is ok, a good value but obviously pretty average taste and quality.    I've been here before for breakfast and remember their omelets being pretty decent (although accompanied by greasy potatoes).  For lunch, I've tried the salmon salad with orange dressing and penne pasta - both good, but unremarkable.  Service could be better.  In addition to being painfully slow (30+ minutes to get our food), my friend tried to substitute a side salad for his fries.  The waitress said this couldn't be done (odd enough), but that she could bring him a separate side salad.  The side salad turned out to be a full-sized salad and was billed individually at more than the price of the sandwich he ordered.  When he inquired, she said there was nothing she could do because the salad \"was no longer at the table\".  Was weird more than anything else.  I wouldn't discourage someone looking for a quick, cheap meal from eating here, and might go back again one day when the line at Earl of Sandwich is long...",

    "text": "My husband and I decided to go out late.  We were trying to find somewhere to have dinner on the strip around 10pm.  Everywhere had a crazy line!  We walked from The Paris to Planet Hollywood into PH Shops.  Because we were sick of walking and were past hungry, we decided to try this place.  Not the best selection ever but we ordered a petite filet, medium with garlic mashed potatoes.  I had really low expectations going in...Surprisingly good!  Meat was tender, cooked to our order, nice portion size. The potatoes were good...the veggies under the steak and potatoes were kind of random....overall, good food.  The server was good...checked on us often enough.  Wine special for between $6-7...I had a glass of white wine.  Nothing to write home about but wasn't horrible either.  They also have a full bar.  Prices were right in the middle...not cheap late night but not very expensive either.    The thing I thought needed the most work is the decor.  Probably a couple years ago, this place probably looked really nice.  However, it's gotten run down.  The wood floors are ruined and were clearly never taken care of.  The booth seats are run down and torn.  Maybe this restaurant was forgotten about during the Aladdin-Planet Hollywood renovation!  I've seen it before while shopping at PH and never went in.  We were happy with the meal we had there but probably won't make a point to go back.",

I'm diabetic, and to have sugar free items is not mandatory, but it's nice! Especially when it's something as easy as sugar free syrup, which is even carried by your local Denny's!!! So this is the way we started! Not on a good foot! Let's hope breakfast is great! NOPE! The biscuit gravy tasted canned, the biscuit itself was Pillsbury... my dining companions were not impressed either, they just felt it was eh!  The only one plus! In a town of Pepsi products, my wife was excited to get a Diet Coke!  Other than that, this place falls flat! However the good news is, we will be back tomorrow! Only we will be going to the restaurant across the hall. When I asked them in my way out about sugar free syrup, their answer was, OF COURSE WE DO!!!",

    "text": "I heard about this place on Yelp when I was bookmarking some new spots for my upcoming trip and stumbled across mixed reviews about slow service, $4.99 Lunch deals, and mediocre food. Well let's talk about those:   So first things first - yes the food is $4.99 from 11-5p / I was in shock too, I know. The entire food menu is priced very inexpensively yet the quality of food offered and the portion size makes you wonder why it's so cheap. We were so puzzled about it, we asked our waitress Maria H. (I'll come back to her later) - and she said that honestly the owner just likes it that way. For dinner time though, the price goes up to about $10.99 which still isn't bad for a restaurant literally in the middle of the strip. **Also drinkers - they offer a 3 for $10 deal all day long. These drinks are regular sized, pretty strong and very good. They also offer other drinks that are super cheap and range from $3 - $10.   The food isn't mediocre at all. For $4.99 you would think the restaurant only served chicken strips, fries, and nuggets but the menu is actually pretty extensive and covers a good variety of choices.   Our server Maria H. was literally amazing. We met her on our first visit to the restaurant and asked for her each day that we came back. She was nice, personable, patient and her customer service was IMPECCABLE. She greeted us and treated us like her own family even when she wasn't serving us. SHE DESERVES A RAISE! SERIOUSLY - THE BEST WAITRESS WE'VE EVER HAD.",

The sauce was horrible and tasted like it has been lying in a can for 6 months . The chicken was not cooked properly and the the other ingredients were far below avg. only in Vegas can I crap dish on this level pass as food..back in Chicago this place would be out of business.  It's like a bunch of Middle school kids put this together after watching Sesame Street. A TV dinner would have been a huge upgrade",

We are staying pretty much across from the entrance to where this restaurant is located and we were looking for something to eat and wanted a place just to relax and enjoy the rest of our evening we walked around looking at menus and settles on this because they have a very extensive menu with so many choices and the people who were already seated and eating looked like they were enjoying.  We were seated right away the restaurant looked full but not packed so we waited patiently looking at the menu 10 minutes went by and we had settled on the drink and the meal, a couple was set right next to us and their waitress came took the drink order and had come back with their drinks ( this is now 15min) my husband walks from the back of the restaurant to the front to ask the hostess if our server knew we were there, she apologized and went to find our server.  Another 4 min the other server comes with water and lets us know our server would be right with us, he never came.  We did leave within minutes of that interaction very very hungry and very disappointed",

The wait for a table at Ocean One can be a little long depending on what time you go but I say it's worth it.   We were there in a group of 6 and they were pretty busy so service was just okay. Same with the food. It was perfectly edible, tasted fine, and the portions were a decent size, but that was about it. It was fine. With all of the amazing food options in Las Vegas the meals here don't really come close. It's equivalent to diner food or food you'd find at a national breakfast chain.  The reason you go to Ocean One is for the drink special. 3 for $10 drinks all day every day. Tons of options to choose from, and the drinks we had you could DEFINITELY taste the alcohol. It always took a little while to get the drinks so don't expect to be in and out in a quick minute. The best part was that you can take your last drink to go. They'll give you a lid and send you on your way. So go for a meal, get two drinks there and one to go.   Ocean One is definitely a must visit on any trip to Vegas just to save a few bucks!",

I got a good burger and fries and I left completely satisfied and my wallet wasn't empty.   If you want cheap, good food, this is your place to eat.",

During our stay in Vegas we ended up eating there four times between sitting down in the restaurant and ordering to go each time they kept the same high standards. I have to give a shout out to our waiter Frank during our breakfast sit down experience he was simply fantastic, kind and very helpful. Hands down I have to say he was one of our top five servers I have come across since I starting writing these food reviews.  The atmosphere within the space was great, the food was fantastic and there food and drink deals were down right crazy! Three drinks for 10.00 and not any watered down drinks, no these were full on top shelf and amazing. My wife and I both had the steak and eggs meals which were only 13.00 each you just don't get deals like that everywhere, not with the food tasting so good, coupled with such great service. I would come back to eat at Ocean One Bar and Grille on my next trip to Las Vegas and would bring friends as well. This is truly a hidden gem if you want the most bang for you buck while in Vegas!",

Their 3 for $10 drink special is a pretty good value too, though I opted for the mango and the margarita frozen drinks. Service was cheerful and quick. Will definitely visit again next time we are in Vegas.",

One of the waiters accidentally dropped a plate behind my party and the sauce and butter splashed all over the arm of my jacket which I had purchased only 1hr earlier. The manager was called by our waitress, who was lovely by the way and when I explained to him what happened he said to \" take it to my in house dry cleaner and bring them the receipt to be reimbursed! So, he wanted me to pay to get my own jacket cleaned and also pay for a cab to come back and bring a receipt.....WOW ! What a rude jackass! Then when I explained I was not from here and would be flying out the next day this prick said\" Well, nobody is\"WTF! I'm not sure what qualifications are needed to become management at this establishment but I would not even hire that guy to sweep! I mean he didn't even offer a free drink or appetizer which wound not have solved the issue but it would have shown he understood that I would be spending money for cleaning when I get home so this could soften the blow. Word to the wise don't go here if you like being appreciated as a customer. Also, I didn't eat or drink at this establishment due to the incident.

I couldn't even get me fork through it! Hubby ordered a burger done medium and it was well done. I asked for a manager and he said the crab cake was half eaten. I had spread it out on the plate after 2 bites.  I handed the manager the plate and told him I wasnt going to argue with him anymore!!! Definitely wouldn't go here again. We go to Las Vegas every year! If the food is bad they'll make an excuse.",

    "text": "Meh.  It was breakfast.  I mean truly, how can you fuck up breakfast?  Even Marine Corps boot camp got breakfast right.  But Ocean One Bar & Grille said, \"Hold my beer.  Challenge accepted.\"  1. Service near non-existent.  I had to walk through the rugby scrum of servers to get a coffee refill.  They need to work on their rugby skills.  They parted for me like the Red Sea parted for Moses.  They never saw there was an issue.  2. Server asked if we wanted jelly for the toast.  Seems like a reasonable and nice offer.  Sneaky little wanker fooled me.  Never came back.  So off I went to the kitchen to ask for jelly.  Finally got a little help...from the cute bartender.  Which is perfect because at this point I needed both eye candy and a stiff drink.  3.  My wife had eggs shells in her over medium eggs.  Maybe that's a local delicacy.  Usually we always order eggs without shells.  4.  As a positive, there is free Wi-Fi, the network and password is on the menu.  It worked for my phone, my wife's phone, and as I sit here watching the staff look at the phones and giggle, I'd guess this server is fan-fucking-tastic!    5. Two coffees, two eggs, and two pancakes came to $24.82.  Paid using credit card via the server's iPad.  The restaurant provides the auto-calculate service for tip percentages starting at 18%.  Seriously?!?  6.  Finally, other than the cute bartender, one of the servers, Elvira Banuelos, was courteous and helpful.  It was the male servers and staff that were lazy douchebags.  So the test question was who can fuck up breakfast?  Answer: Ocean One Bar & Grille",

Definitely some of the most reasonably priced alcohol in all of Las Vegas.  We also got to sit outside on the patio so we were able to see the \"Rainstorm\" show in the Miracle Mile shops and be surrounded by a nice atmosphere.

They also have frozen drinks at $3 and other drink specials.   Our server seemed to be a little confused about out drink order, but it came out ok. We did have to do a few additions of our own (adding soda water) but it was still decent.   Food was ok. We got spinach and artichoke dip to share and i got the crabcake sandwich. Both were pretty good and the fries were great. Nothing to shout home about, but not bad.  Overall, service was so-so. We were looking for our server a few times, it wasn't especially busy so i cant imagine what he was doing, but we were able to pay our check right at the table with an ipad so that was pretty good.

    "text": "Okay so... I am a Vegas local. I am originally born and raised here. I have had wonderful food and I know what seasoned pasta and chicken should taste like. So I went just yesterday with 2 friends to eat and day drink a little. My friend explained to me that this place was the best for the drink prices for the 3 for $10. Okay cool. However, she said she had never eaten there... I was worried after that but do to the setting, I decided to order the rigatoni pasta with chicken for an extra 1.50. Now, why it's 1.50 to add chicken, I dont know haha. Kind of felt like it should be added but anyway, I ordered it an a sour apple cocktail. The cocktail was good and strong so I figured the food would be icing on the cake. So I waited about 20 minutes for my food. It was a little busy inside(which was another good sign) so I was considerate of that. Anyway, I got the recommendation to get the rigatoni from one of the bartenders. She said, \"oh yes, it's really good,\" and with her \"genuine\" reaction to it, I ordered it. Let me tell you as soon as the plate hit the counter I was through. I immediately looked at my friends and then the bartender and I immediately knew I was sending the b.s. that came on the plate right back to the damn kitchen, okay! So as soon as the random gentlemen with the black outfit came out to serve \"just me\" when my friend also ordered the chicken Cajun pasta I was confused and hoping that he wasn't trying to show face like his food was great. Because, it was far from that. I took 1 bite just to see if I was being a brat and let me tell you it was so watery ! The pasta sauce was yellowish and the color of chicken noodle soup. The chicken appeared like it was cut up slices of ham that you put on a salad or something .There was peas on it ! And the pasta had absolutely ZERO FLAVOR ! OH IT WAS DISGUSTING. I SENT IT BACK AND ASKED NOT TO BE CHARGED AND THE BARTENDER THAT RECOMMENDED THE B.S. SAID SHE WOULD ASK THE CHEF IF SHE COULD REMOVE THE CHARGE !!! I WAS DONE. Meanwhile, my friend is STILL waiting for her pasta... It's been at least 30 minutes now. Everyone has their order but my friend... Anyway the bartender comes back out and says that she could remove the charge and that \"it does say peas on the menu\"which was unnecessary to comment on after the fact..Point is that she took that damn charge off. She also told me that the CHEF! AGREED WITH ME THAT IT WAS GROSS AND WASNT SUPPOSED TO BE MADE LIKE IT WAS ! ANOTHER RED FLAG ! LMAO. I thought about that and was like well wtf ! He made it! Lmao ! Anyway I ordered again and instead I got the pasta <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fprimavera.It&s=e1335e078d83354437b1b3fe61b8c2634d43a84b3d9ab73a47d6c5c8f25840e5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">primavera.It</a> was better. Only because garlic and lemon had the pasta drenched in it but it made up for it. However, MY FRIEND WAS STILL WAITING FOR HER PASTA! So her pasta finally comes, same situation.DISGUSTUNG,WATERY, NO FLAVOR.WELL THE FLAVOR TASTED AS IF THE PASTA WAS SOAKED IN WATER OR BOILED IN WATER WITH BACON OR SOMETHING .THAT WAS THE ONLY TASTE. The pasta was dripping on the saucer as she was taking small bites. I begged my friend to return it. SHE is the type to settle and act as if she is bothering someone so she was too afraid. And kept eating it. She felt a little forced so after a few bites she didnt want it anymore and her stomach started to hurt. We asked for our remaining 2 drinks and left . Let's rewind a little bit now. In the beginning they took our ID and NEVER returned them.. My friend told me ...they keep them until you pay... [RED FLAG !] Thats insane but okay... Listen we parked on the 8th floor ! We got all the way to and inside of my car and my friend screamed about our ID's. So now we had to run back. ALL THE WAY BACK TO THIS WACK ASS PLACE.   AND THE GIRL WITH PIGTAILS WAS TAKING A ORDER. I ASKED FOR OUR ID's and she said, \"oh sorry.\" I will not ever eat here AGAIN! It has a nice atmosphere and good prices but ...its just to prepare you for the shit show behind it all. This place was a waste of my time,money, and even appetite. I kid you not.. I left this place paying damn near $30 for shit ..Don't waste your time ! Only drink !",

I ordered grilled chicken with mashed potatoes and vegetables while my friend ordered the mushroom penne pasta. I think my grilled chicken was better than her mushroom penne dish. The chicken was a little dry, but immerse it in the mashed potatoes and all of a sudden it becomes okay.  The most annoying part about the experience is that there is a lady who comes over to your table and asks you if you want your picture taken so you can have a souvenir card. However, as much as this sounds enticing, it is a nuisance because once they bring you the postcard, they also try to sell you your picture. Beware, just kindly decline when this lady approaches you. I do not know why they do this.   Also, the seats on the outside of the restroom are uncomfortable (they are plastic chairs). The seats in the restaurant look much more comfortable and I'd recommend sitting inside.",

The ambiance, look, and layout of the restaurant are as if it is fine dining. But they bring you a plastic sticky menu with very ASSORTED choices.   Pork chops, pasta, mahi mahi, teriyaki?  There arent many choices but all none of them lead you to believe that the restaurant is American, Italian, Greek, whatever. They are all over the board. But it worked for me. I had the goat cheese salad which was plentiful and delicious and reasonable. We also had the spinach artichoke dip which was good and plentiful.  My husband had a hamburger which claimed was delicious. We also had the 2 for 10 drink specials and they were tasty.  Our server was very nice, knew the menu and offered suggestions, and was efficient. She took great care of us.  I think we would go back but maybe not.  I cant put my finger on this one.",

After calling the place, the girl who answered the phone confirmed that she's received several reports of this during the past week.   Apparently there is/was an employee lifting CC #s.  Food-wise, it was so-so. Value-wise, the food was pretty great, compared to other locations in the mall.",

Was not our first choice but after going from restaurant to restaurant without a reservation and the specials were sold out of most joints.... we kind of ended up here as the last resort and just plain tired and hungry. We were pleasantly surprised. The wait staff warmly greeted us even though it was close to closing, the happy hour drinks buy 1get 1 free were the bomb, my steak was tender and juicy. My new fave when I come to town. I am liking this spot a lot! Best Choice",

    "text": "While wandering the shop area by PH looking for some food I noticed this restaurant that had a nice cafe vibe to it and wasn't at all busy, so decided to give it a shot. The moment I walked in the hostess (or possibly manager, because she wasn't wearing the same uniform the rest of the staff was wearing) looked at me like I was bothering her and didn't say a word to me. I said \"two please\" and she grabbed two menus and walked to a booth table, and in the same motion placed the menus on the table and continued walking without even a second glance. At this point I wanted to get up and leave because I hate being treated like my business is not worth the service they are being paid to provide, but alas I decided to eat anyway because the other choices nearby were not what I was in the mood for.   They offer an \"express lunch\" menu which when I inquired about the express 5.99 burger meal was told it's a 3oz pre-cooked, well done burger patty (Isn't that a slider?) so I went with the 8.99 burger meal instead. It was a good-tasting burger and the fries were alright. The waiter was very nice but seemed to disappear for long periods even though there were maybe 20 customers in the entire restaurant.   All in all, this place doesn't really seem to value great service, and for that there's no way I'll offer them my business the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Like most people here. I got suckered in with the $5.99 lunch special sign. On a busy Saturday afternoon in Vegas all restaurants had long lines and the only place that had immediate seating was here. I should have taken that as a warning sign. Plus, I didn't bother reading the Yelp reviews, my bad.   We got seated in the \"patio\" area in the mall along with 5 or so other tables. Next to us was a bridal party with a bride in her tight boob popping dress and veil along with her bridesmaids who had the same type of dress minus the veil and in black. We waited awhile for the waiter to arrive and when he did we placed out entire order.  My boyfriend and I each got the grilled chicken $5.99 lunch special, the spinach artichoke dip and waters. The drinks and appetizer came out quickly. The chicken came out shortly after. The chicken was good as was the appetizer.  The one star review is not based on food but the service. We only saw our server at our table once, when we ordered. The reason being was he was at the bridal party table flirting with all the ladies and helping them figure out the best deal for them to drink as much as they could for cheap. I do understand that when you are celebrating a wedding or another special occasion you will get some special attention. However, not to the point where you are giving all the other tables on the patio a big FU.  How bad was the service? So bad we didn't even get a refill on water. In fact, I had some water bottles in my purse to drink while walking the Strip. Instead we used the water bottles to refill our water glasses.  The total was $26 so we paid and took off. I noticed when we left the patio area everyone else that was still sitting there looked just as pissed as we were.",

The 3 for $10 cocktails are worthless if you actually want alcohol in your drink. $3 pina colada was like a milkshake. The salt shakers and table cloths are dirty. Service is slow.

She was to concerned about standing around conversing with the other employees! She was not what a manger should be. Instead of only 2 waitresses working she could have helped out. But instead I saw her talking to the staff the WHOLE time in a non work capacity and even danced around a bit! Our waitress was great but I actually felt bad for her because clearly she wasn't assigned to our area and was pulled to our table to help out. She had a large group in her section plus other tables and she did her best. She just needed help!! I did realize there were other employees there but they were in a corner booth chatting, playing on phones and then the manager joined them. It was like a big I don't want to work party! The food was brought out by a kitchen person who plopped it down in front of us and took off! The food was only sub par at best and as my hubby said its like chow hall food. Will not be back!",

The mango vinaigrette and marinated onion not only blended with the greens, but worked well with their salmon filet that was cooked just right.  The pistachios added crunch and flavor to this dish too.    The half pound sirloin burger didn't look like it was half a pound, and taste wasn't all that either.    The wild mushroom pepperoni pizza was good in size, but lacked mushrooms and pepperoni.  A crispier crust would've helped too.   As for the Grilled Chicken Club...I've had better!     Service was above average though.  Tracy rocks!  She put cherry flavored syrup in my diet coke and allowed us to plug in our laptop into the wall near the kitchen.

It's a big attractive place with seating outside the restaurant where you can relax and watch the people roaming around the mall.   They have these lunch specials for $5.99 (a couple of sandwich selections for $5.99) and also dinner specials for $8.99. I had a satisfying grilled chicken club sandwich for lunch that came with a nice mound of fries for $5.99. Service was friendly altho not the fastest - it was one woman with a Ukranian accent covering quite a few tables by herself but she was hustling.   Bottom line: Nice option for a casual lunch or dinner and people watching in the mall - won't wow you but should satisfy you. And lunch and dinner deals leave more $$ in your pocket for the blackjack table.",

Because they were so good and the convenient location, we returned on Saturday. BIG mistake!! Antonella, another bartender, served us and was horrible!!! Asked to speak to the manager and she said she was the manager, so I asked for a corporate number and her name. She pointed to a man sitting at the other end of the bar and said he was the owner so I asked to speak with him. The owner, tony, approached us a few minutes later and asked about our experience, which we were honest about and he cut us off after trying to charm us and walks away! gave this place three stars only because the girls at the bar were excellent and had amazing attitudes even though the second time Casey was working with the lazy a** Antonella who was only walking back and forth acting like she was busy - Casey ran the entire bar!  Vegas is an ever changing and evolving place...Tony (owner) needs to appreciate hard working people like Casey and Kayla because he might not be in business long by having people like Antonella \"running\" his business.

The pizza was good for two people for a quick bite (dinner only menu). The tacos are ok and messy. The 3 for $10 drinks special is good (per person, can't share). Give it a try for lunch.",

Food is ok, service needs to improve a lot.  Dining room feels dead.  When you place plastic cartons in sight of the dining room, that tells me you just don't care.  The mandatory 18% gratuity tells me you are not confident in your service so we will force you to pay us a good tip.  Confident places don't force this cause they know their service is good.  Hardly ever got a refill.  Was given attitude cause we didn't order desserts.  Food was ok.  Portions are big.",

    "text": "Yay! I am HONESTLY a fan.  A friend mentioned Oncea One Bar and their awesome drink and food specials.  I was at Crazy Girls but refused to buy a drink NOT when just down the stairs and around the corner I can get 3 drinks for the price of 1...SHUT THE FRONT DOOR, I'm going to get some DRINKS!  The show had not started, so I had enough time to go hang at the bar.  It's advertised throughout the Miracle Mile and Planet Hollywood, how can you NOT go check out this AWESOME drink special.  Oh yea, and there's food too, but I just went for the drinks this time around.  Kind of busy, but room at the bar.  When sitting at the bar select appetizers are $7.50 and martinis/cocktails/wine $10(3 for 1 special), drafts $3, daiquiris/soda $3 (soda free refills)    Yea, so let's jump on this 3 for 1 deal, this is the kind of thing that you tell yourself : 'it's too good to be True, I have to check it out'. $10 - 3 drinks, skeptic at first; I've experienced deals like this where the cost is LOW and so are the QUALITY of the drinks and service, it's a toss up.  This is not the case here, I asked THE question: \"Do all 3 drinks have the be the same?\"  Cody politely said no, not at all.  I just did an internal scream, where on the strip can you find a deal this good and they serving nice, skrong drinks, oh yea, they re pouring very nice over at Ocean One, so don't be stingy on the tip.  I had the Watermelon Jolly Rancher and the Black Pearl, the jolly rancher tastes just like, so I had 2.  It was really good, When I go back I 'll be sure to have some Watermelon Jolly Rancher candy on deck.  And #3, the finale was the Black Pearl, a blackberry liqueur tea, 2 bottle mix TOPPED with champagne.  A nice topper indeed, bill $10, AWESOME.    Great atmosphere, an outdoor patio set-up, very open restaurant. The place was already full when I walked in, by the time I was paying my bill there was a line to get in.  You can honestly have a nice evening w/ self and/or w/ friends, drop $20 and your evening is smooth sailing.  Awesome customer service, I probably was at the bar no longer than 2mins before I was acknowledged by Cody.  He said he'd be w/ me in a moment, but as he was finishing up w/ his customer Casey swooped right in to greet me and ask if I was being help.  AWESOME customer service, good team work, just really nice to see that companies and their employees still treat customers like CUSTOMERS!  The bar got full, however I witnessed each and every customer that came up to the bar of walked away from the bar was GREETED and given 100% customer service.  4STARS b/c I have yet to taste the food, this review will be updated.",

It's tucked away in the Miracle Mile Shops but worth seeking out because everything on the lunch menu is $5. Yes everything. Yes $5. Choose from a variety of apps, salads, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, pastas, or even entrees like grilled salmon or marinated skirt steak. I had the rare ahi tuna wrap and thought it was decent. The tuna was perhaps a little sinewy but I'm not complaining for the price. Liked the wasabi aioli on the Asian slaw. To top it all off, the drinks are so cheap. All the beers were $3 and they have a ridiculous all-day drink special of 3 cocktails for $10.  I sat at the bar and found the bartenders to be polite and attentive. Decent service and not too crowded - overall just a great place to rest my feet and grab a bite and drink.",

The atmosphere was very noisy a lot of people were talkative but I didn't care because nothing stopped me from listening to my parents or the tv.   The service was great the lady that served us was very very nice I like the way she gives us drinks first and then food because if she gave us the food first and then the drink I would get really thirsty.   This place is my personal favorite because it has my most favorite food in the whole world which is the Orecchiette Pasta Its the best value on the strip because its only five dollars for an entree and appetizer.",

It took a little bit to get a water refill but the place was very busy and she was a great waitress so I don't think that was on her.

    "text": "While staying nearby at Elara we went out on New Years Day in search of sustenance and I was craving some pancakes.  Being New Years Day in Las Vegas, we'd gotten a late start and we arrived at Ocean One at 11am.  They have a menu that says everything is $5, so we thought, what they heck, lets try it.  I've probably walked past this restaurant HUNDREDS of times so it was time.     The first disappointment was that by the time they came to take our order it was 11:10 and they said sorry, no more breakfast.  That was a bummer. I ordered the burger and I was surprised to find that for $5 it was a good sized burger and tasted good!  The fries that came with it, though, were horrible; lukewarm and soft and dried out like they'd been sitting around for a long time or microwaved or something.   I passed on those.  The husband had an order of wings and an order of tacos.  He liked both.  The food was surprisingly good.     The biggest problem was just the TERRIBLE service.  Took  forever to take our order, took forever to get our drinks refilled after we finally got someone to send our waiter over.  When we got our food we had no silverware or napkins and when we asked one person, he said okay and disappeared, never to return.  We finally got our waiter's attention and once he came to us, he wandered all over the restaurant looking for silverware.  It was SO weird.  Same thing when we tried to pay...   My husband chatted with the manager on our way out just to let her know, but it was really bad.  I guess I'd eat there again, but it wouldn't be my first choice because there are so many places to eat right there.  Although, I might hit up the bar for the three drinks for $10 deal some time!",

I ordered fries just to munch on before our meal came-they were all so soggy I'm not sure if that was intended but they were almost microwaved-but we were so hungry we didn't want to wait longer for a new crispy order. I asked how the mushroom risotto was and the waiter said they don't have that so I pointed to the menu & said it's right here on the menu.  Guess either he was new or the item was new but shouldn't your staff KNOW what you sell?  (The ranch was actually really good for the fries. That sadly was the best part of the meal) When I ordered Filet Mignon I asked for a side of sauteed spinach instead of the vegetables. Spinach side was TINY! Maybe 2-3 bites worth. Vegas came dumped all over anyway on top of the mashed potatoes when I said NO Vegas. Not the end of the world but I didn't want them. My steak was ordered butterflied and \"well done\"-then I ate 1/2 and the other 1/2 (@$9 worth) was red-medium inside: that's NOT well done. This drives me Insane. I told the waiter and he said he'd tell the chef or he could re heat it..I mean he never came back so my guest was already finished with their meal so I just gave up on 1/2 my filet mignon-wasted $$ not happy. Overall I was disappointed-the steak would have been good had it been cooked properly. Why doesn't a chef comprehend the difference btwn medium and well done? Ugh very frustrating. Sad when locals are always iso places to go to & tell visitors to check out but you can't send them to a place you genuinely had a negative experience at.",

Beer is $3 and cocktails are 3 for $10 and make sure you save room for dessert (it's probably the best) By the way, just because it's cheap doesn't mean you order everything on the menu like we did...it's not a buffet.

I should have known from the beginning when I ordered a Caesar salad and the waiter asked if I wanted ranch with it. What kind of satanic monster puts ranch on a Caesar salad, didn't matter anyway bc I received a garden salad instead. My waiter looked right in my face and handed me an incorrect salad and then proceeded to ask if I needed anything else. Ummm yes? My salad lol? Next I ordered a bacon cheeseburger because I'm fancy ya know. Ordered it medium rare, received a topping less beyond well done Krusty Crab patty also without bacon. Oh, forgot to mention their Calamari is basically a spaghetti appetizer that they've replaced the linguine noodles with shaved calamari pieces. Literally can't make this stuff up. Lastly my fries arrived very fast and very cold so to suffer thru this experience I requested a side of sauce, set me back a dollar. This place has fantastic drink specials that would give Applebee's a run for their money. I would encourage them to make JUST drinks and for you to avoid dining here unless you're into well plated hole in the wall bar food.",

We asked several times to switch a tv to see the kickoff, and had already ordered food and drinks under the impression that they could show the game.  Unfortunately they don't have the package so our game couldn't be shown.  It would have been great for the manager to tell our server up front this was impossible bc they don't have the package.  We had to get everything to go.  On the up side the 3 drinks for 10 bucks is as cool and food was yummy.  Just disappointed in the lack of communication about the game situation.",

    "text": "What a steal!  We passed by this restaurant on several visits and finally decided to try it due to their great advertisement right at their entrance.  Lunch is $5!    This seriously has to be one of the best deals on the strip.    A jamba juice will cost you $9 easily or a slice of pizza for $8 or an orange juice for $5, etc - so instead of paying premiums everywhere else, you can get a whole meal for $5 with sit down service? Sold!  With prices this low, you can order a gang load of food if you wanted. Order yourself a drink, an appetizer, entree, dessert, go wild.  Plus, their hours are so great that you can't miss their deals - lunc ends at 4pm, which is perfect for Vegas night owls!  Dinner is cheap also - which I believe is $10. Also, you can get 3 drinks for $10.  So you get the idea now, everything here is cheap.  Now as far as the food and service go, it's not great. So you are getting what you pay for.  But this is a nice find and good option to have especially after you spent so much money on gambling, shopping, and expensive dinners.  Location: inside Miracle Mile Mall on a corner",

For the baller on a budget I really recommend this place if you want to blow your date away. Seafood/Italian/American AND some Vegetarian options. I love this place, my go-to for dining on The Strip hands down!  This place is super romantic, they train their staff to have the patience of saints and try their best to give really good presentation of the food. And the drinks are fantastic!",

The waiter was pretty snotty and had an attitude for no apparent reason, did not seem like he enjoyed his job. He did not comeback for refills which was a bummer, and I kept having to ask someone else for one. I got one of the penne pastas, it was decent at best. It was a good portion but got cold fast and the bread was very hard, it also did not taste very fresh. My aunt was also with me, and her food did not come until like 15 minutes after I finished mine, and it was a pretty small plate with ravioli. The place was fancy and had great decor. The wings with teriyaki sauce was really good and was great in flavor. Overall this place has decent food but needs to work a little better on service.",

We met friends there and loved finding out that not only were the drinks buy one (on an average price of 9.99) and you get two for free, but all food on their lunch menu was 4.99. We ordered several things from the menu, salmon, chicken tacos, french fries and a salad and they were all very good, solid food choices. The menu has something for everyone and it's nice to be able to sit \"outside\" which is really in the mall and watch everything go by.   They have a really nice cocktail menu, I had some sort of Hawaiian Sunset that was delicious and the Ocean One Margarita was very good too.  Everyone in my party enjoyed their drinks very much, and not just because of the price. Our server was lovely, we had fun chatting with her and she gave us great service. We would definitely go back on our next visit to Las Vegas.",

The drinks were $10 for 3. $10 for 3 drinks..I paid $30 for two waters at a club the night before...this is an unholy deal.   We had a couple beers (only $3) but they were in smaller cups. Our waitress was super nice. The big issue is that with low prices comes really disgusting chairs, a cafeteria feel, and questionable looking protein on your salad.   Come here for some quick and cheap drinks, skip the food, and wonder at the madness of Las Vegas.",

    "text": "We discovered this place last year when we visited. The food and service was great. We went back several times this year and the service was also great. However on our last night in Vegas, we stopped there for their famous $7 burger. This burger is usually good it that night it was horrible. We asked for medium well and it was well done to the third power.   Neither of us finished it. Our server was either new or flustered by the crowd so service was also horrible. We waited 15 minutes before we were acknowledged. My cousin had to go to the hostess booth to speak to someone before our server came over.   He never apologized for the delay. He gave us water and left. He didn't even ask if we were ready to order. He went to the table next to us and took their order and they were seated after us.   We were quite disappointed considering all of the great experiences we've had at Ocean One.",

Their 3 drinks for $10 is a nice deal, but the wine I got was so cheap that it gave me an instant headache so I ended up paying $10 for one glass of wine. Also, you can't share the drinks so my husband and I couldn't order three drinks for each other - he had to order his own and I had to order my own as well. You also can't share food. I'm guessing that means you can't \"split\" a dish.   Yes, there's usually a wait but I think the prices attracts people and also it's mostly tourists - you don't see any locals here. As tourists ourselves, we didn't mind but felt we definitely got what we paid for ($5 pasta and $10 drinks... so, yeah).",

There were open tables but they could not seat me until they rebooted their computer system so I sat at the bar instead of waiting 10-15 minutes for them to fix their glitch.  slow service had to ask for each item as I needed it, they did not just set my place setting in one shot, ketchup, salt, sugar.  Ice tea comes out room temp - had to ask for a cup of ice and the waiter who brings out the food and drinks hardly understands English so I am resorting to hand gestures.  Thought I tried to keep it simple and order a burger - it was simply awful.  Bland, no seasoning, dry and small.  To top off a lousy meal they had to subtract someone elses order off my bill. They could not print me a receipt and their computerized tablet only offers a tip choice of 15%, 18%, 20% or you could click on another button and put in your own tip while they are holding the pad. Bad meal from start tot finish. One of the worst overall dining experiences I ever had",

It is right in the middle of a lot of shopping and if you don't want to spend all your winnings on a meal in one of the casino restaurants, which I know the casino would love to have you do, this is a great alternative.  They have a decent menu for breakfast, lunch and dinner and service was great.  It is setup up like a street side cafe with lots of tables boarding the fake street in the Miracle mile Very open and airy. Just a nice atmosphere.  Prices are very reasonable. Ocean one also has some great drink specials so you can start your day or night there and then move on to the more expensive bars which you will have no trouble finding on the strip.   I am a fan for this place because it lets me have a meal and still have some dollars to gamble or spend in the mall if I want.  This is rare on the strip anymore.",

The hamburger was clearly a frozen patty even though the waitress mentioned it was NOT ever frozen to me. I asked before ordering. It was gray which shows also that it's probably old/not fresh. Sadly, even the side salad was disgusting. None of this comes even close to the grossness of the fish sandwich. Holy moley...just opening the sandwich to look at the fish was an absolutely disgusting sight. For crying out loud the place is called OCEAN ONE, and they can't serve halfway decent fish?? It was clearly old/not fresh and should NOT have been served. Buns were stale as well. Spinach and artichoke dip was edible but not good.   This place needs Robert Irvine or Gordon Ramsay to come in and help. I would be scared to see what the kitchen looks like...",

    "text": "The male Indian manager working on 03/31/19 was incredibly rude.  I felt so awful for my partner having to have an argument with a manager.   The pasta he ordered was pretty bad.  The noodles were very chewy and he only had a few bites before telling me he would like to switch it out with something else.  I said sure, let's ask the waiter.  The wait staff member was very nice and got the manager.  I could tell the manager was going to be awful when he leaned against the wall, slouched, and crossed his arms.    The manager started by saying, \"we don't do exchanges\".  My partner asked to simply exchange it for something of less value on the menu.  The manager said, \"we don't take plates back\".    The conversation became worse when the manager said, \"You ate more than half the plate so no I'm not switching it out\".    This pasta was 13.99.  It was the Cajun Alfredo Pasta.  The issue was the pasta was made with something other than a white alfredo sauce.  It appeared to be almost an Italian dressing with cajun spices.  It wasn't a traditional alfredo sauce.    The manager brought a menu over and read it to my partner and said the pasta was the #1 selling pasta on the menu.  (At this point I felt so awful for my partner).  It was like getting a lecture not to politely complain. I sat there and tried to soften the conversation because the manager was very forward and rude.    After nearly a 5 minute confrontation, the manager finally agreed to switch the meal out.  He said he wouldn't take the remake order and that we would need to wait until our server was available.    My spouse had to finally give this manager 'the business' and he finally took the order and had a new meal brought out.    This was a very awful experience.  I will not be back to this business and will let my traveling friends and family know to avoid this location.",

However, a colleague from work that's been here several times, suggested we stop by.  Great diverse menu. Sandwiches to salads to main entrees of chops and salmon...all $4.99 during lunch. Lunch ends at 5pm.  Sometines with an across the board low price like that, you can trade away a lot of quality. That didn't happen here.  My shredded beef tacos (3) were awesome.  Other plates at the table were the salmon, Maui tacos and one amazing looking burger stacked.  Fold in the $3 draft Stella among other great drafts and the call say 3 for $10 drinks all day...this will definitely be a repeat place for me.  Sat at the bar...constant great service and great views of the games on TV.",

The salads are mostly wilted lettuce and the pasta looks out of a box.  The service is even worse. If you want to be ignored go there lol and when you flag down a bartender expect a dismissive attitude. Your condiments will arrive after your food is cold and it's cold because you again have to flag someone down. On the cold burger 7 dollar special there is an up charge for additional items so the cold 7 dollar burger is really 9 bucks. I just don't understand the attitude thing. It's one thing to pay for bad food but to pay for bad attitudes go figure. The place next door is a million times better.",

My boyfriend got the filet mignon and I got a pasta and shrimp dish. The waiter was attentive and they were good about my allergy. The food was delicious. The atmosphere is nice, it feels like a fairly elegant dinner but with paper tablecloths and casual prices.  My only complaint was that the ordering and paying was all done on a tablet, which is all fine and well, but the waiter struggled with it which made the ordering and paying process longer than usual. Since you pay on the tablet, it was also quite awkward that the waiter is watching the screen when you had to choose the amount to tip. We always make sure to tip well but I did not enjoy feeing pressured to do so like that.",

The burger was also very good and totally worth it. The prices weren't too bad, it was like $40 for both of us and when it came to paying we didn't have to wait forever for the check.

Soft bread, tasty moist chicken and fresh veggies. And they actually cooked my \"soft\" fries soft and not burnt...just like I asked them to do!  The chicken pops as an appetizer we're delicious! Even the restrooms have improved. Friendly staff and the food actually LOOKS as good as it tastes! How can I articulate what I mean?   All the lettuce for sandwiches are cut a certain uniform way. The chicken breast was a perfectly shaped patty with perfectly placed fake looking grill marks on it looking like \"Magazine Food\" if that makes any sense? lol! When you go there just look at your food closely and you'll see what I'm talking about. If McDonald's mass produced a lamb chop....it would look like these lamb chops. A perfectly shapped little fake looking chop, he he! This place is supposed to be health conscious and hormone free meat but it honestly doesn't look that way...not even close. When I looked at my tasty chicken breast before I ate it I didn't see anything that looked \"Natural\" to me, lol! But I don't care about that! I eat \"fake\" fast food creations all the time \"Taco Bell\" , he he!  I don't know WHAT in the world they are doing to make this food look and taste so flawless! I don't know if it's indeed fake food prepared by an assembly line of robot cooks in the back or if most things are \"pre\" cooked and prepaired directly from packages (which is probably the case)  BUT whatever they are doing keep it going!!! Along with the great prices...No complains from me!!! :)",

We walked by Ocean One when we saw they  had lunch specials (on a weekend? a holiday weekend no less!) We walked in and saw it wasn't very busy. I didn't get the chance to see the reviews on yelp (gasp!) but we were pretty happy with the experience. We got seated and asked for a drink order quickly and our waitress soon enough got our lunch order. We had the calamari to start, and i had the jerk-seasoned mahi sandwich. My boyfriend got the grilled salmon. The calamari came out sort of looking like a mess, in a pool or marinara and shredded parmesan but it was actually really good. I'd never had calamari like that but it was my favorite part of our meal. The mahi sandwich was great, nicely cooked and the jerk seasonings were excellent. A little spicy but not burn my tastebuds spicy. They came with seasoned fries that looked freshly hand-cut and those were great. My boyfriend's salmon was ok. It came with shredded veggies and mashed potatoes that were also sub-par. But for about $7 each entree, it wasn't bad at all. The service was quite slow, but since the food was great, i think they deserved a better rating than my fellow yelpers had previously given them.",

I got the Double Cut Pork which our waiter said was probably the best thing on the menu, and it was pretty good. I really like the apple sauce/reduction that it came with.

I had read they had a decent oyster selection, but when we went there were 3 choices. We ordered a dozen of mixed oysters and then a half dozen of fried oysters. The oysters came out chilled and were pretty tasty. I wasn't really impressed with the accompaniments, but I was pleased with the oysters. My problem though was with the fried oysters. They were 1) gritty 2) overly battered (too much batter to oyster ratio) 3) overly fried. This was disappointing. Also as soon as our waiter realized we weren't going for the more expensive dishes he seemed to disappear. We had to ask for our check a couple of times and then waited several minutes for him to come. I didn't appreciate that. Nothing really special and not worth another visit.",

I told the server that i was vegan and he instantly replied with \"what is that?\" with an over the top attitude and looked at me like i'm stupid or that i was annoying him. i explained to him nicely what a vegan lifestyle entitled and we were able to switch the cream sauce to a tomato sauce. He came back maybe 10 minutes later to verify everybody's order very quickly as if he didn't really care but he actually had it down correctly. Another ten minutes later they bring out the food and i'm presented with a plate of pasta covered in a garlic CREAM sauce. i explained to one of the other employees that i ordered it with a tomato sauce because i can not have dairy. He was much more polite than our server. He took the plate back and then they were able to correct it. The pasta was decent once they got it correct but the overall experience sucked ass all because of our server. I wish i got his name down but i forgot.  1 star for the nice employee (not our server).",

The bartender never cleaned the glasses, or dirty dishes the hour we were sitting there - there were several other spots around the bar in the same sad shape. Saw several people come in and then leave since there was not a clean place to sit.  She was busy drinking shots with some friends - it was only 1pm in the afternoon on a Saturday, guess she was thinking it was the end of her shift. I am all for having fun, but not at the expense of customers.   Food - don't even bother. much better places for the same amount of $$ to put out and get some quality food.  Place looked great when observing from the outside, but the service, food and overall experience was totally a waste of our time and money.  Their only saving grace is the location or they would be out of business. please eat somewhere else.  Tried to find a manager to talk to - but no one around, must be why the bartender was drinking and the food servers had to get their own drinks for the customers.  Foodservice is my business - I wouldn't waste my time calling on a place that does not take care of its customers...they will be out of business before long.",

    "text": "Like the previous reviews state, \"Where do I begin?\"          My husband and I brought his parents to a fun weekend in Las Vegas. They are not culinarily adventurous so we looked for a place that would have standard american fare.  The miracle mile had many places to choose from to eat, but we saw this menu and felt it might please everyone's tastes. Little did we know it would only serve the tastes of those who LOVED awful food and \"rip off\" drink specials (suckers.)        We entered what looked like a fairly nice restaurant by a friendly hostess.  Our server promptly came up and offered us drinks and showed us menus. We asked about a two for $10 drink special offered on the menu.  He let us know the drinks listed on the menu were the only specials that evening. All were sweet and made with \"smirnoff\" flavors. I dont drink that brand so asked for my vodka up with olives. My husband tried one of their drinks and our parents stayed with water. We ordered a quesadilla to share. My father in law ordered a burger medium. My husband ordered a goat cheese salad and I ordered a \"Wild\" mushroom pizza with pepperoni.  Sounds good so far, right?        About 10 minutes later, our server came back with 2 waters and my martini that looked cloudy and REEKED of vermouth. My husband's \"special\" was a 3-4 ounce drink. It looked like a shot glass with a straw. My martini was supposed to be JUST my vodka up with olives. I tasted my drink and I really do believe (after 8 years of bar tending experience) that I was only served vermouth in a glass. The server came back about 10 minutes later and I told him the issue. He was confused at what I was asking, but took the drink back. I understand some servers arent as educated about this so it didnt bother me too much at the time.      10 minutes later a food runner came our quesadilla. Still no martini. We all tried a bite and bit into a large tortilla sandwich FULL of white flour. I've had better at taco bell.  :(       3 minutes later we received our entrees. My pizza was only button mushrooms, undercooked cheese, on a lavosh that was also undercooked.  Still no martini. My husbands salad was wilted to the point of mush with a big ball of fried goat cheese.  My father in laws burger was a hockey puck with cold fries.       3 minutes after that, my drink came. A martini glass that had 2 olives and some vodka and the vermouth that was originally in the first glass. We were all disgusted.      In order to get on with our evening, we asked for the check after waiting for a manager that never appeared, even though they werent busy. On inspection of the bill, our server added gratuity even though only 3 of 4 ate. We signed, left, and will NEVER go back. I'd rather dumpster dive behind McDonalds.       We did try to call the next day and alert the \"manager\" of this issue. We waited on hold for 20 minutes before we were hung up on.  We tried to call back to get a busy signal for 3 hours or so.        Long story short, I dont know WHO or WHAT owns this restaurant, but I have a funny feeling it may have been a used car salesman that lost a job, and hired his fellow salespeople to run a \"restaurant.\" You'll get a good \"looking\" place, but get shafted in the end.  BAD SHOW  !",

You can get a cheap breakfast here in a nice setting and we enjoy coming in when in Vegas since it's close to where we usually stay. I had a the ham and cheese omelet and I guess it served a purpose of curing my hunger. It was very basic with some cheese sprinkled on top. Potatoes looked like they were seasoned and would be tasty, but were bland and mushy. Toast was so thin you could have played cards with them. My wife, however, loves the plate that comes with a bagel, thinly sliced salmon, tomatoes and lettuce. It's a huge plate and she always is quite pleased.",

The mall might be attached to the Planet Hollywood which is too the right of it.  We were able to get a table for the eleven of us without much of a wait.  This was nice considering we had 4 hungry kids.  I was also impressed that we were able to get a table so quickly on a Sunday night.   Prices here were decent which took me by surprise.  It's a nice restaurant, large in size, and a bar in the middle.  After we all ordered, our server brought out some cheese pita bread for us to snack on.  It wasn't actually long before all of our food came out.  I don't think we even finished all the bread.  I ordered the Mahi sandwich, and it was great!  The Mahi was so tender that it was falling out of my sandwich with each bite.  I was also able to have some of the seared Ahi my brother ordered.  It was good, but I'm glad I order the Mahi.  I washed my pallet with a pint of Guinness... aahhh!!!",

And I'm surprised that they have a decent size menu and things like calamari, salmon, and skirt steak were on the menu. And that's what we ordered. I got the skirt steak. It comes with mashed potatoes and veggies. My gf got the salmon, mashed potato and veggies and it was good! The portion was small but we can't complain for $5. We also ordered the spinach artichoke dip and fried calamari. The drink menu was what got me. You can upgrade to the premium drinks for $14 for 3. And they had some good scotch on there. So I had a scotch tasting. I ordered Johnny Walker black, Glenfiddich, and Glenlivet on the rocks. I thought they were going to be tiny or pour it over a lot of ice. But they were double shots! I'd come back again and I recommend this place to anyone who's looking for a good deal on good food and drinks. We came on a Saturday afternoon. And there was a group of people waiting outside of the restaurant. I thought we were going to have to wait an hour but we were seated in 15 min! I can't get over how great this restaurant is",

    "text": "Located conveniently in the Miracle Mile Shops center, Ocean One is a casual dine in restaurant serving traditional American fare.     We were attracted to the unusually special valued 1/2 pound sirloin burger with a choice of a side of fries, coleslaw or black beans.  The burger was made of quality ground beef and definitely tasted like restaurant quality and not fast food.  It received a solid four stars.  We also ordered the kids' buttered pasta with added chicken and the crab cake sandwich.  The kids' pasta was well portioned and the added chicken was especially moist and flavorful.  The crab cake sandwich was pretty standard yet still satisfying.  Unfortunately service fell a tad short.  While the original order came fast, we had a few issues that required reordering.   The fries and coleslaw automatically come peppered which some of our party members do not care for.  It took a good 20 minutes for the remake of the side of fries and replacement veggies.    Between the decent and well-priced food yet with slow service, Ocean One receives three stars.  If you're looking for a good meal while in the area of high priced meals, then I recommend coming here for a family friendly food stop.",

The places was packed but we were able to walk right up and get a table for 2! (Insert James brown dance) baby baby baby, when I looked at the menu and everything to eat was $4.99 I WANTED IT ALL!!!  They have a large variety of food to choose from. We had the lollipop chicken wings and spinach dip to start. It was so good! We then had the brisket taco meal and the Mahi Mahi burger! Everything was amazing! Right on down to the banana and watermelon daiquiris. Our total bill was a whopping $35!!! I was shouting like a sinner in church! The service was amazing and ppl were packing in this place. It's right in the Miracle Miles shops inside Planet Hollywood across from the US POLO store! I'm telling you, it don't get no better than this! I haven't been impressed in a long while with a restaurant from start to finish! Keep up the good work!",

It was good too, I don't know why I hadn't been here before.   My husband had steak veggies and mashed potatoes with brown gravy.  The portion of steak was kind of small but for $5 it was a grear value.  We also had the spinach and artichoke dip with chips, both the chips and dip needed salt.  The $3 pina colda wasn't bad either.  My only issue is that service is very slow and we spent most of our time waiting for our order to ge taken and waiting for our check.  But this is somewhere I plan on bringing my family I just have to plan on being there a while.",

We always look for the best food deals because honestly, I'd rather spend my money on other fun in Sin city.  Lunch for 4 consisted of glazed wings, a burger and fries, chicken tacos w/chips and salsa, salmon w/mashed potatoes and roasted veggies, and penne with chicken. 6 alcoholic beverages = approx $52  Breakfast was A bit more expensive. Eggs And bacon are $5.99 and I wasnt too impressed with their Bloody Mary. Everyone who knows me, knows I am a sucker for an amazing Bloody Mary. It didn't really have flavor but I drank it because of a $7.  I had the garden omelette which is pretty damn good, and I must admit that I did enjoy the people watching on the patio. Breakfast service included a 20% gratuity which may be why the service was slower than usual  ambiance is causal and Great for people watching",

Yesterday, I brought a group of 5 people to eat here for their Lobster and Steak special. Food was good (however we were surprised by the size of the lobster - it was way small). Service was good. We paid our bill and left. Then we got home and started trying to figure out why the bill was so high. We finalize realized that the server had added gratuity and not told us so he got tipped twice! (Side note: no where on the menu does it say there will be an added gratuity).   That takes us to tonight. We said hey, the server owes us since he made over 40% gratuity on us last night, let's check it out again tonight. See picture...we ordered the same thing and the same thing happened but it was WAY worse and I thought to take a photo!!!! The lobster was literally cut in half. We said something to the server and he said no it's not that's 6 oz!!!! (See photo). So obviously he wanted to pretend that our two lobster and steak dinners had not been cut in half. And it gets better... a few minutes later the lady next to us has her lobster and steak dinner delivered.... Guess what?!!! Hers is also cut in half!  Is this real life? The business practices operated by this place are deplorable. Yes, food is good and service is good but be wary of the practices going on at this restaurant...",

This review is for their online to go items as I had a not so happy experience at dine in where the hostess is somewhat clueless when dealing with disable person on mobility scooter and doesn't think before sitting them at a place where they ask if I can park far and walk to table........:(   We learned of this online menu from our friend's ale HP are frequent vacationers to Vegas with family, we were already impress with their price and portion size for breakfast and dinner/lunch items. This time we ordered breakfast items for my family, eggs Benedict was very good and with 2 eggs plenty of hollandaise sauce, my wife gave it 2 thumbs up, however when we ordered the item, we ordered coffee, it did not show up with order, got lost in translation, disappointed with that, otherwise croissant sandwich for kids to share is plenty, eggs any style with protein and hash is on point. Eggs Florentine was a bit disappointing, the description was very attractive but when the actual item showed up, it looks dead, too dried up. This order came up after we arrived or they've made this earlier and waiting on yet another lost is translation with order of egg any style choices did not get transmitted, that was mess up so unfortunately if things went smoothly this would have been a 4 to 5 stars review, with screw ups like this they score a 3 stars only. If I count the sit in, it will be a 1.5 to 2 with lack of common sense to sit a handicap person and zero to little attentions from our waiter who doesn't come back to give us refills on drinks",

This time around I got the steak quesadilla because I wasn't too hungry. It was a bit small, but for $5 I can't complain. The boyfriend had a chicken club sandwich that ended up being more bacon than chicken! Again, no complaints there! I went basic with some mimosas and he had three different sweet fruity martinis.

What?!?! He got it anyway & said it was just ok. Barely had any sauce so he asked for more & waitress acted like we were a bother to her. I ordered the filet & lobster tail. Lobster was cooked to perfection! Soo yummy! Filet, was good but a little dry if I didn't dip it in the sauce. I also ordered a Bloody Mary, thinkin they made it on the spot, contrary to popular belief, its pre-made! So I couldn't even customize my order ( I always ask for no or little spices ) she said since its pre-made the only thing they could do would be to put more tomato juice in it. I really wanted one so I decided to get it. It was just ok, knowing that it was a pre-made mixture & not real tomato juice. What a Bummer!",

And she is picky.   I got the half-pound burger. Added bacon and mushrooms. Total $6 during lunch special. Bacon was perfect. Mushrooms were perfect. Burger was perfectly cooked medium rare -- which I find restaurants struggle with. One of the best burgers I ever had, for sure for that price. Came with fries. They were decent.   I got three signature cocktails with decent amount of alcohol for $10. Moscow Mule was especially good and decently sized.  Tequila Sunrise was OK. Awaiting Classic Gimlet now.  Wife had frozen drinks for $3 a pop. They were OK.  Clearly a really good experience.",

I specifically told our waiter before we ordered that I had a Groupon as to avoid any confusion or issues. I asked if it was for food only or both. He said it was $20 towards ANYTHING. Ok cool. I don't drink much (yeah, yeah I know it's Vegas lol) but my boyfriend wanted to drink. We order his 3 for $10. I wanted food. He wanted drinks. That simple. Well I'm petite and never finish my meal so I obviously gave him the rest of it, but then the waiter came over to tell me that splitting food is not allowed and if the manager sees us we will get kicked out. WHAT?!! I'm not throwing away food when there's someone willing and able to eat it. What kind of service is this? I don't care how great their drink specials are if they treat their customers this way.",

When I go to pick it up they claim my order didn't go through regardless of me showing them my email AND bank statement. The owner couldn't give a crap about my situation, sounds like they are stealing money to me. This is not the first time they has happened to me. I just went back and this happened AGAIN. Give me my money back, crooks.  Don't be fooled by the low prices the customer service is the worst I have EVER seen and they are stealing money.",

And their 3 for 1 drinks was the cherry on top. Would recommend this place! Everything was good and the drinks were strong. Also our waitress Tashay (hope I spelled that right) was amazing!

We were actually surprised how good the food was, considering the prices weren't ridiculously priced like the other restaurants nearby. I ordered a burger and fries for only $6.99. It was half a pound of sirloin and you have the choice of adding cheese, sauteed mushrooms and onions and it came with fries. Pastas are around $10- $14 (the mushroom and chicken pasta as well as the chicken penne was very delicious). Filet mignon for only $27.  Our server Milcah was nice and knowledgeable of the menu items. I would recommend this restaurant if you're looking for somewhere to eat while you're shopping at the Miracle Mile Mall because it's inexpensive, but also doesn't fall short of taste.",

Those are my pros.  Now for the cons.  Service always seems to be slow even when they are not busy.  Also, we went for drinks over the weekend and the bar was really busy.  We got. Table because we wanted to be able to sit together.  Our server was really rude to us and kept suggesting that we go to the bar.  I could understand this if the restaurant was full or they were on a wait.  However that was not the case.  I'm still on the fence about this one.  Will probably return and hopefully have a better experience",

I got the salmon and my wife got the pasta (they did not spare the asparagus hearts). The IPA's which I never heard of were tasty (reminded me of Tower IPA). At $3 a beer and a $3 strawberry daquiri, the meal filled us up, got some beer and liquor in and the server was witty and cordial. Definitely will go back next time we're in Vegas.

Too good of a value to pass up. Go before 9:30AM to beat the morning rush.   The menu is very basic and straight-forward. There are plenty of choices to choose from: pancakes, French toast, waffles, scrambled eggs, omelettes, biscuits and gravy, fruit, etc. And the option to opt for egg whites? Hell yeah!   I ordered the Garden Omelette w/ a side of sausage ($2.50) and a side of biscuit and gravy ($2.50). I completely ruined my nutrition during my mini vacation w/ my kids but I am back at it today. My trainer did see some of the pictures I posted on IG and bitched about it but hey.. I was on vacation!   Service was great. Our server was fast, thorough, and super nice. Made me feel welcomed from the get go. The food came out pretty fast, too.   The omelette was a bit under-seasoned but the vegetables were cooked perfectly. The potatoes looked simple but it tasted great. Gavin enjoyed the sausage and the biscuit and gravy tasted OK- the biscuit was a bit too dry to my liking but the gravy was thick and delicious.   Definitely would recommend this place for cheap eats!",

Sure, I wouldn't order something like the seared tuna here for $4.99 but the calamari and chicken  tacos were great!  3 for $10 for a ton of drinks and you can get them to go!  Our faves include the Key Lime Pie & Almond Joy martinis!

    "text": "Me and 10 other friends & family members came here for the $4.99 lunch. There was a large selection of food for the $4.99 price, good sized portions & everything tasted really good, which is surprising for such cheap food. HOWEVER, the service is pretty bad. Idk if the problem is that the staff is overworked with so much traffic due to the cheap prices, or if they are just not very customer friendly, in which case you would think that they would not be serving and interacting with guests. Our server urged us to quickly order in a specific manner which was confusing to many of my non-english-speaking family and he came off as rude trying to rush them while he was taking all of our orders stating that we should all know exactly what appetizers and entrees and drinks we want in that order per person. Which was very weird since they were 11 of us and we planned to share appetizers, as groups of friends and family often do. When the food came out our main waiter's assistant never ever knew which food went to who and as we were having conversations, enjoying our time in the restaurant, he would stand there looking annoyed and making sighing noises because he didn't know who ordered which dish and we weren't all listening to him. I thought that was inappropriate since I used to work in a restaurant and was specifically told to not \"auction off\" the dishes and that we should be paying attention to which seat number ordered which food so that we could put it out in front of them and not have to interrupt their conversation. The fountain drinks there are something like $3 which is fine because they include free refills...that is, IF you are able to get your server's attention in order to order the refills. We did not receive any refills on drinks or water unless specifically asked and sometimes we had to ask more than once. Our server looked rushed almost the entire time and the main waiter's assistant always looked annoyed. If it weren't for the fact that the lunch food was such a great value and tasted so good, I would never come back to this place. So the food gets 5 stars & the service gets 1.5 in mine & my fellow diners' opinions.",

I don't think this deal is good on weekends maybe only on select days.  We ordered a Stella (on draft) and Amstel light. The skirt steak that came with mashed potatoes and sauteed veggies in a Cabernet reduction. The steak was a little chewy but still good. The sauce was delicious esp soaked in the mashed potatoes. The 3 cheese omelet with house potatoes. The potatoes were well seasoned and crispy! They were really good. The mahi mahi tacos were pretty good and it came with salsa, pico, and sour cream. For 5$ entrees and 3$ beers you can't really go wrong. They had a lot of other dishes on there that is definitely worth a try like the burger.",

It was garnished with an orange slice and cherry. It was sweet and refreshing. I feel like I was on a tropical island. The Mojito was served over rocks and consisted of Barcadi Rum, club soda, and mint leaves. The Strawberry Margarita was served over rocks but didn't really taste good.  For entrees, we ordered the Orecchiette Pasta and Margherita Pizza. The Orecchiette Pasta consisted of orecchiette, artichoke hearts, onions, tomato, spinach, and parmesan cheese in a lemon garlic sauce. The pasta was garnished with freshly grated parsley. The dish was flavorful and had a fragrant aroma. We felt that the pasta was a bit on the doughy side and slightly overcooked as the pasta was stuck together. The Margherita Pizza was a thin 10\" square pizza that tasted like a cheese pizza with shredded basil and sliced tomato on top.",

Big mistake!  This place is popular because of their reasonable prices. We were seated promptly with quick attention by wait staff. After we ordered we watched a number of people who were seated after us receive their orders. We waited about 40 minutes for our food. One 2 egg breakfast with ham and Florentine eggs. When we were finally served they brought bacon instead of ham and the toast seemed as if it had been reheated in the microwave. I think they had to grow the spinach because it took so long. Excuse by wait staff was that the Florentine takes longer to cook. If that is True it should not be on the menu when everything else is 5 to 10 minutes.  We were in Vegas for four days and did not return to this place.",

However, the punk ass owner, decided that we didn't deserved to be comped for our time being wasted. Overall the experience was horrible but our server was so nice and trying his absolute best it made the lunch somewhat more enjoyable. If you go here the food is great but the owner just a greedy asshole that wants to take advantage of his customers since a majority are tourist. @ the owner if read this, take care of your customers and don't you ever yell at your employees for trying to take care of mistakes that YOUR kitchen made.",

I got the mahi-mahi sandwich and while it was a bit on the dry side, I won't complain much since they made up for it with the size of the dish.  My friend got the quesadilla  which he said wasn't bad and the 2 girls who got the salmon enjoyed their dishes.    I always thought that great deals in vegas for dining were dead but they are alive here!",

    "text": "They get 5 stars for sitting us immediately even though they're located in the miracle mile mall which is super busy and so crazy you have to elbow your way through. Our waiter Jerry was amazing, friendly and fast and so nice. The prices were amazing for their lunch specials which runs up to 5pm. Everything was $5 and all beer was $3. We ordered a handful of plates because we assumed they were appetizer sizes based on the $5 price and everyone wanted to share. Nope!!! They're full size servings and excellent quality. I'm vegetarian so I only ate omelette and some salad but the rest of the fam loved everything from the chicken Greek salad to the calamari and the salmon. My dad said it was way better calamari than many of the places he's tried the last year. Fresh and not over cooked and not smothered in panko. I wish we had found this place before the last night when we had to leave but now we know it's there and it's great so we will definitely visit the next time we're back in Vegas. Thanks for your wonderful service Jerry!",

Ocean Bar was very busy during the Saturday afternoon we visited but sitting at the bar and being served by Alexcia allowed us to enjoy our food and drinks much faster than if we waited to be seated at a table in the restaurant. Plus the bar was a lot more lively and fun! And our food and drinks came quickly. And tasted great!   The bar had 5 bartenders working hard to fulfill drink and food orders, but Alexcia was the only bartender working extra hard to take care of all the bar - at least 35 people - with a smile on her face, to boot! We enjoyed her service has will be back, that's for certain!!",

All of the drinks are very goid and not watered down scrappy grade alcohol. I also suggest my favorite appetizer the chicken wings. Only one flavor choice but the sauce is to die for. I think my colleague tried the shrimp eggroll and dipped it in my wing sauce and it was love at 1st taste. Sometimes it gets busy and service levels lack a tad BUT they are always nice to us. I feel like being nice and kind will always overshadow the downside of the situation. I'm sure I'll be there again several times this summer.",

Steak was unlike any beef I've ever tasted.  Like a McDonald's McRib mystery meat--except this was whatever the polar opposite of tender is. Eggs were from a powdered mix.  Go for the over medium instead of scrambled, then at least you know it's an egg. The toast must have been baked in the smallest pan known to man. Never had a piece of bread that literally fit in my palm. Potatoes were the only saving grace. Everything was tasteless,  except the potatoes.  Service was polite, attentive,  and prompt.",

The first time everything was marvelous, great food, good service, great prices, this time not so much. No greeter and a couple minutes later she emerged. I waited a whopping 15 minutes to be contacted and then I had to flag the greeter to ask to put in my order. Another couple minutes later a waiter emerged with no apologies for my wait. He takes my order, I ask for a manager. 5-10 minutes later no manager no nothing. What's crazy is that it wasn't even busy! I didnt even drink the water on the table I just left. Gonna head to the golden arches for breakfast where they respect my time and my money.   Update: Ok so I lied. They hooked me again because the buffet at Aria was stupid expensive. The food was good but that wasn't the problem before. It was the service. This time my service was great like the first time I came. My service was nice and attentive but playing devil's advocate, I was one of the first people here. Great f'n value for the price and good tasting food, in general and especially for Vegas where cheep good food can be hard to find. I got 3 drinks and breakfast for under $20 with tax. For price alone, worth a gander.",

First let me say their marketing group is smart.  You could have had a $5.99 burger or $6.50 pasta dish but somehow a blanket $4.99 lunch grabs you like a Dollar Tree sign.  Walmart May have the same thing for 88 cents but hey it's a dollar let's get it.  The place was packed on the Friday we arrived but our wait wasn't too long.   The restaurant is big and there are tons of service staff.  We ordered sodas and a wing appetizer, my wife had pasta with chicken artichoke spinach and other stuff in a cream sauce and I had a cheeseburger. Wings were quite tasty as was the pasta.  My burger was a burger but he fries were hot and seasoned well.  They also had a 3 for $10 drink special which included a wide array of drinks.  Also a $2.99 frozen drink special.  I'd come back again for lunch as the menu was varied with lots of stuff I would gladly try.  And it was tasty enough to hook me in yo try dinner as well.  Hey you could spend $5 on a fast food burger or taco, why not sit in a nice restaurant and have a real meal for the same price.  When in Vegas....",

Just go to Fat Tuesday's where you can get drunk for the same price but with much better service.

Appetizers range from, spinach & artichoke dip to ocean eight wings. 3 different salads to choose from. 3 different taco choices: grilled chicken, Mahi or Shredded Beef. An array of sandwiches and wraps. The chefs specialties, oh boy! Herb crusted chicken breast, grilled Atlantic salmon, penne steak, orecchiette pasta & marinated sliced flank steak.  There's something for everyone here and it's all under $5 before 5pm John has the Caribbean Mahi Sandwich. 6oz Mahi Mahi grilled to perfection topped with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, avocado, House Made mango habanero aioli sauce. You hungry right?  I was so full from my 1/2 lbs angus burger that I didn't have room for dessert. John had the sinfully delicious Chocolate Lava Molten Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream. Whoot! Whoot! That was John tooting his own horn he was so pleased with his dessert choice...Lol.  This definitely goes down as one of the best cheap eats on the Las Vegas Strip! Too bad we only found them on the last day of our trip. Will be back soon",

But cant complain for the price. You can even get your last drink to go and walk the strip etc with your drink! How awesome. Would come here again for my 3 drinks!   The paradise punch was my favorite although I liked quite a few of them. The almond joy one seriously tastes like almond joy, such a tasty dessert drink.",

So if your tired of spending ridiculous money on food in Vegas it is a delight to your pocket.  Also 3 drinks for $12.  Advice- Just order the 3 Straight and get the chaser on the side.

    "text": "$5 for every item on the menu for lunch?  A friend mentioned that there's a restaurant on the Strip where everything on the menu is only $5 for lunch.  I had to check it out during my recent Vegas trip to see what this $5 deal was all about.  Ocean One is in Planet Hollywood/s Miracle Mile.  As you walk up, signs promotes its $5 for all lunch items and 3 cocktails for $10 and all beers for $3.  We arrived shortly after noon and the restaurant was crowded.  We placed on name on list with the host and were seated in about five minutes. The lunch menu includes appetizers, tacos, salads, sandwich & wraps and chefs specialties.  With the LV heat, I started with a cooling frozen margarita for $3 before placing our orders.  After checking out the menu, we gravitated to the chef's specialties of herb crusted chicken breast, grilled salmon, marinated sliced flank steak, orecchiette and penne pasta and spaghetti & meatballs.   Our orders: Grilled salmon with mashed potatoes and sauteed house vegetables with a lemon caper sauce. The 6oz salmon filet was well cooked and was moist.    Marinated sliced flank steak - cooked medium rare as ordered and came with mashed potatoes, sauteed vegetables with a cabernet sauce. The steak was grilled and tender.  So a $5 lunch does exist on the Strip.  Inexpensive meals virtually disappeared in the 90's with the introduction of the mega casino hotels. Nice to see good food and drinks in normal portions at inexpensive prices.  Service was friendly and efficient too.",

(near ALDO retail store)  There's no shortage of good food @ Vegas... but Ocean One, located inside Miracle Mile, beats out its competition by a mile!   Where can you possibly find their lunch selection for just $5!!!  Unbelievable quality food at great service for $5 lunch!!!   Nope, I'm not talking about a $5 soup or salad discount.  These $5 menu offers are exceptional values!!!! Think:  HERB CRUSTED CHICKEN CHOP Served with Mashed Potatoes, House Vegetables and Natural Au Jus  GRILLED SALMON Served with Mashed Potatoes, House Vegetables and Lemon Herb Sauce  MARINATED FLANK STEAK Served with Mashed Potatoes, House Vegetables and Cabernet Sauce  ORECCHIETTE PASTA Chicken, Artichoke Hearts, Spinach, Onions, Tomatoes, Lemon Garlic Sauce  PENNE PASTA Chicken, Mushrooms, Tomatoes, Caramelized Onions, Pomodoro Sauce and Parmesan Cheese  I've tried them all as my favorite is the ORECCHIETTE PASTA, without cheese and go light on sauce.  They don't spare or go light on the ingredients.. it's a full size dish at just $5!  Wish I have an Ocean One near my house!!    Because of this exceptional value, I would usually also splurge on appetizers.  I've tried all of the following 3 and hey don't disappoint.  My favorite is the Ocean One Wings where the glazed sauce is so yummy!!  TUNA TARTARE Diced Ahi Tuna, Chili Oil, Sriracha, Mayo, Scallions, Avocado, with a Touch of Wasabi and Eel Sauce, served with Crispy Wanton Chips  CRISPY CALAMARI Wakame and Szechuan Garlic Sauce  OCEAN ONE WINGS Mahogany Glazed Lollipop Wings tossed with Scallions and Sesame Seeds  This is also a very popular breakfast / brunch spot.  Expect a short wait @ peak hours but i've never waited more than 30-mins.  My favorite spot to sit is @ the \"outdoor\" tables doing some people watching and watching the rain fountain.  So much fun!!  So kick back, relax, do some dining and enjoy their 3 for 1 cocktails for only $10 or a $3 beer!!  This place is awesome!  Oh, and their service is always quick and friendly.    An awesome 5-star restaurant for good food, good service @ exceptional value!!",

    "text": "TLDR: When in Las Vegas, I highly recommend having lunch at the Ocean One Bar and Grille! Take advantage of their super cheap and great tasting $5 lunch specials and 3 for $10 drink deal!  Located in the Miracle Mile Shops (connected to Planet Hollywood), this restaurant was super easy to find - there is usually a line up during lunch hours, but it goes by fairly quickly. My friends and I came here for lunch a couple days in to our trip to Vegas (we saw that the restaurant was super popular, so we thought to try it out - and... who doesn't like affordable food in Vegas!?). I ordered their Deep Fried Calamari (for $5... IKR!?),  Mahi Mahi Tacos with a side of salsa and chips (comes with a side), and Orecchiette Pasta (consists of chicken, artichoke hearts, spinach, onions, tomatoes, lemon garlic sauce, and parmesan cheese). BTW, I did share this, haha!   Deep Fried Calamari - for $5, I cannot complain! But, the calamari was overcooked, very dry - it comes with a tomatoe-y sauce on the bottom, but it did not help. I ended up asking for tartar sauce on the side - I recommend that if you like tartar sauce (I think it was also made in house, yum)!  Mahi Mahi Tacos - comes with three tacos, pretty bland - it definitely needed some sauce...   Orecchiette Pasta - DELICIOUS. A must try. I thoroughly enjoyed it, even though it was a tad on the salty side, it was overall very, very tasty!   They also have a selection of alcoholic beverages for a very decent price (beers $3, frozen cocktails $3, etc.).  Because I loved the restaurant so much, I came here for a late dinner and ordered the Grilled Ribeye ($24.99) - it was hands down the BEST ribeye I've had.  Overall? I loved it :)",

Nice atmosphere in the restaurant. HaThe waiter came over promptly with some waters. We had already looked at the menu so we were ready to order. I got the chicken chop and the BF got the chicken club with fries.  I really enjoyed the chicken chop. It was cooked perfectly. The veggies and mashed potatoes went well with the jus on the side. The meals were perfect lunch size portions.  The Fries with the club were seasoned well. The sandwich was ok, but the BF felt that it could have been better seasoned.  We were in and out in an hour with our appetites satisfied.",

Our group got a bunch of appetizers to share and each got our own thing.   Best thing about this place are the drinks! They're so cheap. It's 3 for $10 cocktails and if you only drink the first one you can take the other 2 as a double to go. Beers are $3 so that's also nice.  Service is friendly, my only gripe is that they don't clear dishes even if they see it. We stacked all our appetizer plates in the middle and they just brought out our next round of food and put it around the dishes. Made it really cluttered.    if you're ballin on a budget this place is worth going to for food and drinks.",

Breakfast items were fantastic- eggs Benedict and steak and eggs, and prices were very reasonable for the great quality. Steak was at least 8 oz and perfectly cooked- very juicy, tender, and flavorful. Servers were great.",

And the best part.  All cocktails are 3 for 1. Mix and match and not crappy well liquor either- Ketel One, etc.   For $15 I got 3 cocktails and a salad... That doesn't suck. Service a little slow but really nice and they were really busy. Lunch everything is $5, dinner it's $10.   I'll definitely be back for a cheap eat and drinks.

The first time I had the crab cake appetizer, and that was hands-down the best, most fresh tasting crab cake I've had outside of Florida and Maryland. I also got the half pound sirloin burger with Swiss and mushrooms. The burger was cooked to perfection and was thick and juicy. It was late, so I decided to get a few drinks. The Moscow mule was great, and a perfectly balanced between the vodka and ginger beer. Neither overpowered the other. The Long Island was good, but did not stand out too much. I liked the paradise punch-but if you do not like super sweet drinks-steer clear! This one is a very sweet drink. The watermelon jolly rancher was also tasty, without being too sweet. It was sweet, but the sour balanced the sweetness well. The bartender was friendly and helpful and made great drinks, and I was definitely in a \"good place\" by the time I finished here. I came the following day for lunch, and it was a great deal! I started with the spinach-artichoke dip and it was amazing- creamy, yet still had a bunch of spinach and nice chunks of artichoke. A lot of places will have the dip kind of burned on the sides of the dish it's in, but this dip was perfect and had no burns. The next thing I had was the salmon and it was a great serving size with spiraled veggies and mashed potatoes. It was grilled perfectly! I finished wth a molten lava cake and it was exactly what my sweet tooth had been craving for the last few days. It came out warm and there was a ton of sauce inside. Each of these were only $5, so I was able to leave a $20 and felt full and satisfied and got to have a tasty 3-course meal. I am not sure how they can do it and still make money, but I'm not complaining! This will definitely be a new regular spot to go to when I come to town!",

He made sure we were satisfied and took care of our needs. The food is great, but when you have servers who cares enough to make you happy is out of this world! We CAN'T believe we missed this place when we are in Las Vegas. We stay at Planet of Hollywood that my husband had won these tickets from 94.7 the Wave to Christina Aguilera The Xperience for 6/8/19-6/10/19. It was meant to be for us to try out these incredible food, yummy desserts, and fantastic deals on drinks during lunch time. I'm pretty sure the food is more than great for breakfast and dinner, too. So if you ever want to eat delicious food come by to Ocean One Bar and Grille to experience yourself. You can count on it that you had hit the spot.

Our server only came by once to refill a water cup the 1.5 hours we were there. Every time we would ask her for something she would say yes and then go off and we wouldn't see her again. Took forever to get the check, and the restaurant was not even filled to a full capacity. Definitely will not be returning here.",

The service is friendly & attentive.  Our waiter, Jose, left nothing to chance.  I love the bread they give you, both sour dough & fuccaca, perfect with olive oil; the fuccaca being a bit crispy.  The lobster & shrimp ravioli is to die for with fluffy lite pillows of ravioli stuffed with a savery blend of lobster & shrimp in a wonderful parmarosa sauce.  I tried a little of my mother's caprice salad which was wonderful with buffelo mozerella, tomatos, & basil in a lite olive oil.  I tried one of my aunt's fried oysters which had a perfectkly lite crispy badder & tender oyster.  Everything was a hit with all of us.  Round it off with one of the micro brews on the menu & you will not be disappointed.  So, for some excellent seafood at reasonable prices with friendly service in a casual yet upscale atmosphere, Ocean 1 cannot be beat.  Keep up the good work guys.",

Started with the calamari appetizer nice coating but could have used more sauce. Not a bad crab cake sandwich, although a little dry. Good portion for the tuna but again a tad overcooked. Not going for the ambiance, again the whole mall in Vegas thing, but at least on par with many of the hotel restaurants and at a better price  Bottom line could be better could be worse",

I should've known not to order salad because it was a depressing sight. 99% is romaine lettuce then just speckles of black beans, corn, and a teaspoon of brownish mashed avocado. Despite what I ordered, my boyfriend had the Mahi burger which was phenomenal! Perfectly cooked fish and a good portion. I was extremely jealous so we came back the next day and I ordered the Mahi burger and there were no regrets.  Service is meh, the first time we were seated \"outside\" of the restaurant, it took the server 10-15 minutes to take drink/food order. I recommend being seated inside just so you're seen.",

On Tuesday March 3rd, my coworkers and I went to Ocean's to celebrate an achievement at work. I paid with a debit card I don't use very often, and we left.   The next day, first thing in the morning, my bank called to let me know that someone had authorized $900+ in charges. I only had $100 in that account (don't use it very often), so I was overdrawn $800. My info had been skimmed and stolen.  I went to the restaurant to speak with the manager, who actually turned out to be the server who helped us yesterday. What a sweet set up, serving tables, skimming card numbers, and being the manager that complaints go to.  TLDR; buyer beware!!!!",

One morning we were walking by with a little over an hour to spare and thought that we would dine here for breakfast.  There were only a few tables with patrons seated, so we figured we would be able to catch a quick coffee and meal for three under an hour.  Big mistake.  Once we were seated outdoors around the corner, it seemed as if we were out of sight and out of mind.  Everything took long from placing our orders to receiving our meals and getting the final bill.  It was extremely stressful being that we were on a time constraint, and had to leave the hotel an hour later.  We had to gobble down our food once it arrived and had asked for the bill at the same time.  Our simple meals consisting of waffles, pancakes and bacon were pretty decent, but the extremely slow service brings down their rating another star or two.  I wouldn't say that I'd be interested in coming back anytime soon.  #100 / 100 Yelp 100 Review Challenge 2014",

We wanted to order some more food, and were waiting for over 20 minutes for our waiter to come back to our table as he hadn't checked on us once. When he finally stopped by it was 5:05, and he said we could no longer order any food, despite the fact that we were seated during the lunch hour and had been waiting for him to come to our table. So if you come for their lunch specials make sure you come at least an hour early to allow time to wait and wait for your waiter so you can still order within the lunch special timeframe. Also, waiter was apparently unable to charge our card to their chip reader and just left the table. He left the tablet at the table and we saw you could manually input the card information, so he just didn't feel like it. We had to input the card information into the tablet ourselves since he never returned to the table.",

A margarita tasted like a mimosa & a mojito was basically soda with mint leaves floating in it. The waiter Hannah said we couldn't have a frozen margarita.. Then why have it advertised all over the menus & have us seated next to the machine as it spins. I don't get it.  She just kept selling the 3 drinks for 10$ that's a great deal of there was actually alcohol in it...She never came to the table much & when she did she brought the wrong drink, but I didn't want to send it back for a crappier one. I will give it 5 stars for ambiance and environment. It's very deceitful.",

    "text": "I got sick (vomiting) a couple of hours after I ate here. I think it was the pasta with chicken. Or the BLT with chicken. It might be too good to be True (value for $$$).  Beware.   -----  If it was based on value alone, in a city like Vegas where everything is expensive, I would give this place 6 stars out of 5.   We happened to randomly pick this place from the Planet Hollywood casino directory based on the name, i.e. assuming it was surf and turf. When we go to the resto for a late-late lunch at 3:30 pm, we saw that it was $4.99 for any item on the menu!   Considering that it is in The Strip and a nice place to sit - on their indoor patio - vs inside where there is loud music, bright  lights and lots of TVs. But again coming during an off- peak time might be part of the reason we got such good service from Abby & the food came out quickly.   This trip we have eaten the whole gamut from high end restaurants all the way to basic but delicious McD's breakfast sandwiches. At Ocean One Bar and Grille there is a large enough variety of items including appetizers like calamari, to salads sucks as warm goat cheese salad with pine nuts and to chef's specialties like marinated flank steak.   We had (numbers in bracket are rating on taste for each dish) : - warm goat cheese salad (5/5) - chicken taco salad (3/5) - chicken wings (5/5) - orecchiette chicken pasta with creamy Parmesan sauce (3.5/5)   ****Revised to 0/5 as I believe it made me sick - the chicken**** My friend had a few bites only and felt queasy -- I wish had listened. Instead I ended up vomiting on the plane ride home!   Plus a beer each (Coors light and a Blue Moon) at $3/each.   Oh and I got a chicken club to go for later! Ha! Always planning my next meal and airport food is so over-proved. Our total came to $33.48 including taxes (but not the tip). The portion sizes are the same as a regular restaurant, i.e. these were not sharing plates.   We even lingered as it wasn't busy as it was too late for lunch but too early for dinner for most.   The bathroom was clean and modern.   Few places with free wi-fi!!! *****  Would we recommend? Yes!  Will we come back? If we are ever back in Vegas than yes we would come back.",

We sat at the bar for breakfast and were greeted by one of the bartenders after a few minutes. She asked if we wanted a drink and we told her, she instructed the bar runner to get our drinks but she only brought one of our drinks. We asked her for the other and after a minute she finally brought it over. She then took our order and told us it would be out ASAP. We sat there for 30 minutes, we were discussing to go to a different restaurant for better service because they also overlooked our empty coffee cups that we had to ask for refills for. Then our food came out, Luke warm at best... but, we were hungry and didn't want to wait another 30 min for possibly the same temperature food. I then had to ask again for refills. One of the bartenders is nice, the other is snooty. The runner was nice too, but more interested in her phone than servicing the customers. They definitely need at least one more attentive bar tender to help keep the bar flowing smoothly.",

When we pointed it out she apologized and said it was her first day on the job. She messed up my husband's burger order (forgot the cheese and onions on it) and came back for my order wondering what kind of salad I wanted. I wanted the Santa Fe tacos not a salad...

When My Burger arrived they had forgotten to put the Swiss Cheese and  Bacon on it .   So I sent it back.

Eggs Florentine was also good, potatoes were nice and crispy. Eggs were a little over cooked, the yolk wasn't too runny. The flavors were good and they didn't try to over complicate the dish.   Servers were friendly and the bussers were very attentive.   Got seated quickly but the wait for the food was a bit long. Between the two I was glad to trade waiting outside with being seated.   Service is a little slow, but I will attribute that to the fact that servers looked spread thin and (like above) everyone was seated quickly.   Overall, the quality is well matched by the price. The wait is a little long but it's worth it.",

    "text": "We visted twice.  Happy hour one night and breakfast in our last day.  Compared to neighboring Ocean one, this Breakfast food is better.  Both places offer grand experience discount and/or military 10%.   Vegas is a very friendly military discount city and don't forget to pick up coupon booklet in the mall. At ocean one, I had the eggs Florentine with a choice of rye, wheat or white toast.  It had artichokes, cheese, spinach and little square shaped fried potato. For $7.99 It was very good.   My husband had the $5.99 breakfast they advertise.  Coffee is good and certainly less expensive then Starbucks. Our server was very friendly and I like that almost everywhere in Vegas they charge your credit card at the table. One complaint is the silk floral arrangements are pitiful, we sat \"outside\" and there were still poinsettias in the dividing wall box.  It's July!  It looks like plants were missing too, I don't like the neglect of those details.   Inside the restaurant are multiple tv's and the bar is hopping later in the day with 3 for $10 drinks.  They serve one drink at a time, no sharing and the minimum space of time to get your next drink is at least 5 minutes.",

It is conveniently located in the miracle mile shops. I just happened to stumble across their lunch specials when my husband and I were looking for something quick and inexpensive for lunch).  We both got beers and a spinach dip appetizer. I got the mango salmon salad, which was very refreshing and full of flavor!  The spinach dip was just okay, but for $5 I'm not complaining!  Our bill was less than 20$ including the tip! Now, the servers seemed to be spread pretty thin outside of the bar area so you have to have some patience if you want to save a few bucks. We went back with a couple of friends and just got drinks at the bar. The service here seemed to be much quicker. The best part about this place are the drink prices. 3/$10 cocktails, and you can mix and match. You just can't share your drinks but you can take your 3rd to go!",

    "text": "I have to say... do not be deceived by the price point in this restaurant! We assumed a \"you get what you pay for\" attitude when requesting a table at this establishment. But we left feeling like we had one of our most delicious meals on the strip. We ate at a lot of big name restaurants this week, and most honestly fell short. But the food and the service at ocean one was hard to top! Who knew a $30 surf and turf could rival the $98 versions nearby! We are big seafood lovers... but have a hard time ordering it in a landlocked area... we are from Florida where are options seem to be endless for fresh seafood. Tonight we began with the sesame seared tuna (to gauge the quality) and also the calamari. And both items were huge crowd pleasers... even the one year old scarfed down his fair share! Then we ordered our entree's... the teriyaki tuna (prepared rare/seared, as it should be) and the surf and turf and once again, we were amazed at the deliciousness of each meal! We couldn't believe how wonderful everything tasted!! I'm just sad that we were so hungry, that we didn't take any photos!! To top off our delicious meal, Cheyenne's service was impeccable!! She was friendly and informative, with out being pushy as some servers in the area can be!! Very refreshing experience overall!! And this review wouldn't be complete without mentioning the 3/$10 cocktails...'y'all... I had 3 Tito's/soda for $10... in Vegas!! Unbelievable!! We will be back in September and you had better believe we will be back to ocean one and requesting Cheyenne as our server!! And just to be clear, we didn't receive any compensation or discounts for this review... this is as real as it gets!!",

We didn't really want to spend a lot of time eating nor did we want a lot of food.  We stopped in because I remember seeing an ad for a cheap cheeseburger. We didn't really want a table so we sat at the bar. The bartender lady was high or something. She didn't pay attention to us and she was frowning the whole time with her hood on her head.  We mentioned the cheeseburger ad and she said that it's 6.99 and that we could add bacon for no additional charge, so we did. I asked her what else came on the burger and she acted like it was a trick question or something. She told us that it came with mayo, mustard, ketchup, lettuce, and onion all on the side. Then she walked away.  The bartender brought the burgers out, after about 12 minutes. She dropped them and left. The burgers had bacon, lettuce and onions on it. Nothing was on the side.  We had to get up three times are ask for condiments because the bartender was no where to be found. By the time we got the condiments, the fries were lukewarm, which pissed me off. Well actually the fries was a surprise to me. I didn't know the burger came with fries. Either way, they were cold by the time I got to eat them.  The burger was dry, even with the mayo. The bacon was undercooked and the fries didn't have a lot of seasoning. Even though the fries were not hot, it still tasted better than the burger. The burger tasted like a boot.  We will not go back!",

It looks like a classy kind of Italian restaurant, and then they have these weird, dirty, sticky plastic menu and random stuff. It had some italian food (brick-oven pizza, pasta dishes, no spaghetti) and then a chicken club, cheeseburger, buffalo chicken wrap...just very random. I suppose it caters to a lot of people.   I got the Cajun Alfredo and it wasn't at all spicy. Spinach Artichoke dip was good. Friends got calamari and said it was really bad.   Our waiter was kind of unfriendly - he was just awful. We were with a group of 12, and a very reasonable group at that. Before he even took our order, he immediately and very defensively said that he couldn't do individual checks. We never even asked him about it, we all were in couples and triplets and would be splitting it up that way. We were confused and surprised until he said he would do that. He should've just asked us. He also got flustered when we ordered more drinks from him instead of going to the bar...I don't know why, considering our group probably made up a large portion of who was actually in the restaurant. On the plus side, it's cheap and was convenient when we were all hungry....but you get what you pay for.",

Their portions are quite large, so it is best to share. I had their mushroom and pepperoni pizza, which was delicious. The pizzas taste very light, so you don't feel like your belly is growing while you eat. They also have drinks specials - 2 for 1 cocktails.   We were in vegas celebrating my friend's birthday so the waitress offered to take a complimentary picture for us. She gave us the free picture and offered larger prints with frames for $20 ($10 each), which is still a pretty good deal if you want them for trip souveniers.   The rainstorm is also right outside of the restaurant, so if you sit outside, you can watch the rainstorm while you eat.",

Never ends.  However, the never ending happy hour consists of only certain drinks while the sign says \"any combination of any drinks\"(you can see pic I post)(also more of the False advertisement) lol But hey as a local, $10 for any 3 drinks that have kettle one, located on the strip, for a male! That's worth 3 stars all in itself! Won't order food here again unless it's like hot wings or something that literally can't be messed up. But I will be cal for these drinks.  Even the guy next to me I've never talked to told the waitress literally now as I'm writing this that he has eaten many burgers in his life and this is by far the worst. Lol no more to say here.

    "text": "We have been coming to Las Vegas  for our Anniversary for 25+ years and we always have dinner at a very high end restaurant. One of those was the Stratosphere's \"Top of The World\". After a bad experience there, we started shopping around for an exceptional restaurant to celebrate our special day each year. We tried several but found nothing that really impressed us enough to make us return. This year the Jockey Club Management had a recommendation, in their weekly events flyer, for the \"Ocean One\". Although the prices didn't indicate this restaurant to be very upscale, we decided to try it. We arrived early for our reservation and were promptly seated. From then on we were astonished by:  1. The Waiter's (Angel) positive and gracious attitude. 2. Clean and pleasant atmosphere. 3. Menu choices/prices. 4. Ease in which substitutions were allowed. 5. Food (Filet Mignon) cooked exactly as ordered. 6. Manager's concern for our comfort and his gracious attitude.  After dinner we paid the bill and then decided to stay for drinks. The drinks were promptly served and we were told we should take our time. Angel returned several times to check on our drink status. We generally provide a better than average tip for good service and this night was no exception. When we paid the bill for drinks, he questioned our tip amount two times. This doesn't happen often in the restaurants we generally eat at. If a server thinks there may have been a mistake in the tip amount being too much, they generally take the money and run.  Don't let the prices fool you. This is, in our opinion, a 1st class restaurant with an excellent Chef, Manager and service.  Thanks to Ocean One and the Jockey Club Management (Lori?) for a great evening. we will be back.  P.S.: How appropriate that we had an \"Angel\" for a waiter on our anniversary.",

Bottom line - This place has great food, great drinks and is a great value all the way around.

The salmon was definitely not fresh or wild; it was dry and the tomato and onion that it came with was about the size of a quarter...super disappointing. I was expecting more out of the experience. Should have definitely read the reviews PRIOR to dining.",

I did the 3 for $10 drink deal I drank 2 of the cherry limeades and a long island.  The amount of alcohol was not consistent from drink to drink but I got a nice buzz.

I was trying to find a place since my other half and I were seeing two shows to eat in between. It looked really cute, and had \"outside seating\" meaning an outer terrace but not outside but rather outside on the inside of the hotel.   The food was not as good as I had hoped. Although the Pizza my other half had was amazing so I would recommend that! However for as cute as it looks it was not romantic, was slow, the customer service was not great which is surprising for Vegas. It is certainly a place to go if you just want to eat something fast, but don't be expecting much. And do not go there for romance even if it looks charming you can go else where to \"whoo\" your loved one. I would even try the place across the way it looked better, I checked it out when we were done eating.",

I am so going to miss not being able to eat here more often since we were just visiting Vegas for the weekend. If you happen to be in the area I highly recommend stopping in for a bite. My husband has the surf and turn and I had sea bass. I haven't had that quality of food in a long time, so we are definitely happy customers. Our server was a young man that totally helped ease my husband's anxiety by changing the tv to men's US vs Mexico soccer on Friday (God forbid he miss a soccer game even on vacation). So thank you to our lovely waiter, and the reat of the staff. Can hardly wait to go back.",

We were seated promptly!  We were seated on the outside patio. Lovely view of the scenery! I thought it was very annoying how customers would walk out in between our table and the table behind me (literally 3 ft away) Do people not know where the exit sign or the front door is?   The breakfast menu is small and there are absolutely NO SUBSTITUTIONS for anything on the menu. What a fail. My husband and I don't eat pork and he likes steak in his omelettes but that's not an option. Very disappointing how they don't cater to their customers. I ordered the french toast (with no meat) and got charged for an extra egg as a side since they don't substitute anything. I ordered a mimosa and they have a 3 drinks for $10 deal. (Good deal if you like to drink) They will still charge you $10 even if you don't get 3 drinks...what a ripoff.    We waited 30 minutes for our food and so did everyone else around us. When the food finally came, the portions were so small. Our waitress was so slow. We left hungry and we definitely won't be back. There are so many other places to eat.

Their half-pound burger was a solid choice and well prepared with crispy fries. The flank steak with mash and slivered veggies was tasty and great for a light lunch.  But the chicken chop rules here.  It was fresh, crispy not greasy on the outside and tender and moist inside.  The mash and veggies sit in a nice reduction. The chef here knows what they are doing to serve high volumes, quickly and with great quality.  We saw a lot of people enjoying their 3 for $10 drink deal and noticed that they deliver one at a time so you'll always have a fresh one if that's your thing. Service was friendly but busy as they cover a lot of tables so a little patient understanding and a zen attitude will help.  They do take your order and get the drinks out quickly which is always an essential measure for me.",

Sat a the bar twice and had super good service from a deep staff.  Drinks are not watered down and go beyond something and soda.  A dozen specialty drinks and most are very good if a bit sweet. And the food end does not disappoint. And again super inexpensive, especially before sundown. Lollipop wings, steak quesadilla and much more fills out the bill.  $5 for a 1/2# burger, $7 after dark is reason enough to give this place a go.  Weird thing is that drinks are 3 for $10 but no sharing and no problems. Beers are always $3. The last time I saw Bass on tap Margaret Thatcher was running the show. Newcastle too.",

    "text": "It was a 4 \"o\" clock on Saturday, December 6 when I laid eyes on the sign advertising \"half pound sirloin burger with sauteed onions, lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, bacon, mayonnaise, and provolone cheese, and seasoned fries for $6.99. I had been on the Las Vegas Strip for hours and walking from Ebar in Fashion Show Mall toward the south Strip my reliable hunger was kicking in. I was strolling the corridors of the Miracle Mile when this sign caught my eyes. $6.99 for a half pound cheeseburger with toppings in a full service restaurant sounds to good to be True, however, I am cognizant of the fact that Miracle Mile with Planet Hollywood have some decent deals in the heart of the Las Vegas Strip. So, I thought, \"what is the worst that could happen if I gave Ocean One a try?\"       Upon entering the restaurant, I questioned the $6.99 burger. The friendly hostess let me know that it is available for dinner and that it didn't start for an hour (5 PM).       Fast forward to 5 PM, I reentered the exact scenery and talked to the same hostess. It was obvious that the burger deal wasn't a gimmicks at the exact time that they weren't going to give prime seating to that customer who came here for the $6.99 burger at a table in the restaurant. My choices were at the bar or in the patio overlooking the walking path of Miracle Mile. I chose the patio. The hostess seated me at a table visible to the restaurant so that they would know I'm there. A few minutes further, a waitress knew I was there. This waitress wasn't nasty, enthusiastic, or friendly.      I had done enough walking. Now it was time to dig in and do some eating. The burger I was eating was nothing like a Smokestack burger down the Strip in Shake Shack, or nothing like a mouthwatering burger at Fukuburger down the Strip in Hawaiian Marketplace, or as thick and juicy as a burger in Outback down by Showcase Mall. With a bottomless Coke this came out to $10.72 before a tip that made Ocean One a far better deal than OVERPAYING for a $17 dry Philly cheesesteak meal at Nathan's or $16.50 for a cheeseburger at the Treasure Island Cafe. The cheeseburger and seasoned fries were good. It did the job by filling me up at a good price where the only gimmick is that I was looking in at the attractive brightly lit dining room from the patio.        In conclusion I was satisfied just like my wallet was with the $6.99 cheeseburger meal. There are so many dining options on the Las Vegas Strip and so many nights for me to hang out here that Ocean One looks like a one time experience in the near future.",

And when you're extremely tired and it's at least 100 degrees outside, you feel insanely hungry and thirsty?   Yeah! Well Ocean One saved my life.  I came here with my parents when we stepped into Miracle Mile Shops and were dying to eat something simple yet filling. We constantly saw ads around the mall for Ocean One flashing $5.99 meals. Not too shabby! So we decided to check it out. When we arrived, we were promptly seated and given our menus. We ordered and our food came in about 10 minutes, so it was quick! But slow enough to let you know they spent some time cooking it. We all ordered from the $5.99 menu because everything sounded so filling already - no need for entrees! Mom was amazed to find that her talapia dish came with mashed potatoes and veggies. Dad ordered a meaty dish, and that filled him up no doubt. I got a chicken caesar salad, and it was definitely very tasty. I loved the chicken and the egg!  Overall, an absolutely wonderful experience. The waiter was extremely friendly and we got to sit in these fancy-looking booths in a fancy-looking restaurant. And our meal turned out to be only $20! Definitely worth visiting :)",

I don't want to hype it up to make it sound like a 5 star restaurant but for the price (and the price of Vegas in general) it's very good. Also nice to watch the rainstorm right outside.

I'll pass for sure on my next visit.",

I ordered the pancakes and hubby the poached eggs.  When I go my pancakes they were lukewarm at best and dry. The server came over and asked if everything was ok. I said pancakes were cold and he immediately took them back to get new ones. He came back within 90 seconds with two new pancakes and bacon. Definitely not enough time to have cooked a new batch. I suspect that they have these already made sitting under a heat lamp waiting for someone to order.  Do yourself a favor and not eat here.",

The server didn't know what Eel sauce was when asked and that was the only glitch I found.  We were led to a great seat on the patio, or as much of a patio as it could be, sitting outside of the actual restaurant in the mall area. It was ok though because the scenery and eye candy were pretty darn good.  One of my table mates had a crab cake, which he said rivaled those you find in Md. OK. He's from Maryland so I will take him at his word, even though I never touch the stuff. We had a grilled ahi Tuna done to medium rare and honestly, it was really good.  I don't think you could classify this as fine dining, especially given the environment but it was good. The dirty martini, I mean extra dirty, was good, as well. A 4 olive count and lots of brine.  It is what it is and it is OK.",

The place was pretty empty, but we still had to be seated by a server because the hostess couldn't be found.   The menu is pretty cheap, so you are getting what you pay for. My pancakes were OK, very far from the best I've ever had. They came with three strips of bacon that tasted like they were cooked on a griddle that doesn't get cleaned very often. My friends had similar reactions to their food - that it was pretty mediocre. The coffee was a little watery, but overall it wasn't too bad.   I do have to say, we had some pretty good service. Our server was attentive and very friendly. I am definitely bumping my review up one star because of her. The prices are also pretty cheap, 3 breakfasts and 3 cups of coffee came out to approximately $34, which you really can't beat in Las Vegas.   If you are wandering around PH, you might want to try looking for a different place first. If you do find yourself here, lower the expectations.",

After reading other reviews I'm not sure whether gratuity was automatically added to trick us or because we had a groupon. Either way 18% was added and then there was a line to add a tip! No thank you! The waitress was good enough. She paid a lot attention to us, which wasn't hard since there were three or four tables at 6 PM. I have a feeling that she automatically adds tips to everyone's check so she can manage to make a living.   The food was edible. My husband had far more complaints than I did, from raw vegetables to lack of shrimp on his dish. My food wasn't great, but it was hot and freshly made.   I wouldn't eat here again if given the opportunity. There are plenty of delicious places to eat in Vegas, and that includes planet hollywood. Look around, there are other cheap options too.   On a positive note, they make their ranch in house and it is pretty tasty.",

We, fortunately, had the BEST waiter in the house, THOMAS.  I was experimenting trying a new drink (since the price was so reasonable) and I'm not really fond of super sweet drinks so after my first I asked him if it could be made a little less sweet and my second drink was much better, and by the third (yes, I was still able to stand up), it was the \"Goldilocks Principle.\"  It was just to my liking, and it was all because of slight changes in ingredients Thomas made to the recipe.  Also, I noticed that someone said the restaurant was difficult to find.  That's because to find in easily one must enter from the E. Harmon entrance of Planet Hollywood and Ocean One Bar and Grill will be the second restaurant on the left.  We found out about the restaurant from the shuttle bus driver that took us to the Freemont Street Experience.  It's always nice to get recommendations from the locals.",

The hostess was polite and sat us right away, however, that's where the good service ended. I forget the waitresses name but EVERYTHING she did took FOREVER! Took forever to get drinks, take orders, etc. Not to mention when we drank all our ways, ginger ale, or alcoholic beverages she didn't even take the time to see if we wanted more. Literally everytime we needed something we had to flag her down to ask. It was extremely frustrating. Upon further observation it was very clear she had way too many tables and she couldn't handle it. However the food was pretty good. I got the filet and added on some shrimp and it was only $23 so you really can't beat that. Also it all tasted really good. They really need to work on adding good service to the good food cause that was absolutely terrible.",

We've stayed in Vegas for three days now and come here over seven times! It's within the beautiful miracle mile and they've got some nice jams playing inside! When we first came we were expecting a hefty bill because of how nice the place looks and how good the food is... IT IS SO CHEAP! If you come around 3 o'clock they have the five dollar lunch menu in which you can get a big meal for only five dollars! The pasta came huge and scrumptious... for only five dollars! We are very regular customers now and from what we've seen we haven't had too long of waits, later at night it isn't too busy. Love love love love this place and I recommend a visit!",

Food is great. Waitress is horrible. We've been sitting here for an hour. We only saw her twice. Once when she took our order, and when she brought the drinks. Has yet to come check on us. Idk, maybe she quit, maybe she went home for the day, maybe she's on lunch. Update: turns out the waitress did go home! She didn't tell her manager (according to him) he said she did mention it to someone. Which makes this incident worse. Because that means they didn't care to cover her tables. It's sad the first time I went to this restaurant 3 years ago. I enjoyed, that's why we returned. Unfortunately, I wont ever return.",

He took our order and we waited about 30 minutes for our food. We ordered a appetizer and didn't get it till our meal was delivered... I ordered the chicken tacos and the chicken was so dry, and so was the tortilla! I can't complain to much since it was $5, but given that we paid a total of $15 for a Uber it is not worth it.

So maybe that's why it gets a lot of 3+ stars reviews. Because the drinks are cheap and the main attraction here.  The menu certainly consists of a lot more drinking options, and the food options are limited to basic every day fare.  But if you're looking for a place to dine, this is not it. The food was definitely sub-mediocre. The food was completely under-seasoned, and almost everything tasted like it came out of a bag off the back of a SYSCO truck. The only decent part of the meal was the french fries, which are pretty hard to screw up.   I didn't try the drinks, so I can't speak for their quality. But for the price if you're looking for a place to drink, I guess this might be a good one. But if you're looking for a place to eat, move onto somewhere else.",

And it is a very nice restaurant with a view of the beautiful Miracle Mile Thunderstrom Show.  We loved the salmon, the chicken, the mashed potatoes, veggies, Caesar salad, crispy calamari and drinks.  We came several times during our visit earlier this month.  We sat inside for lunch & in the patio for dinner.  Dinner time was much busier but we had prompt service.  This restaurant is very clean with nice seating and a nice huge bar.  Our waiters were prompt and courteous. We look forward to our next visit.",

    "text": "$5 lunch meals on the Strip in Vegas? Let's do this!   We were looking for a place to dine before our back-to-back shows inside the Miracle Mile Shops. The bright e-signs displaying the menu outside of the restaurant was what attracted us. Actually, it was that large $5 above the menu that made us look. The restaurant is huge inside and it also has patio seating under the \"open skies\" of this section of the Miracle Mile Mall.  We went inside and right away we were led to our table and given menus. There were additional selections on their paper menu to those featured on their sign outside. I had the Classic Spaghetti & Meatballs. Just the right amount of food for me as pasta can really fill you up. It was okay, a bit on the dry side, but it was only $4.99. It wasn't a bad deal. Hubby had the Marinated Sliced Flank Steak. He was impressed with his meal and before I could ask him if he liked his meal... it was gone! I guess he really liked it LoL! (or he was super hungry).  The lunch menu is served from 11:30a to 5:00p. We didn't try any of the cocktails... we went straight for the food. I'm glad to see that there are still decently priced food options on the Strip, like, who does that anymore?? Who pays for expensive, tiny portions of food but, hey, beautiful presentation... oh wait, I know some people who do! Anyway, service was good. It won't be our last visit here for sure.

    "text": "Unwritten theme of this place:  No substitutions!    We visited for breakfast and ordered the $5.99 egg combo, which comes with 2 eggs, house potatoes, toast, and meat (bacon, sausage, or ham)  Substitute any other item (even lower cost one) for the meat?  No Substitute English muffin for the toast?  No, unless you want to pay an upcharge Request unsalted potatoes? No, they are pre-made and pre-seasoned Substitute any other flavor jelly for the strawberry jam?  No.    Not only were they totally inflexible, the food was not very good:  * The scrambled eggs were inconsistently cooked, with parts being well done and parts being runny. * The toast was inedible.  It was stale and hard as a rock, even though it was lightly toasted.  We had to ask the waiter to replace the toast. * The potatoes weren't freshly prepared.  They were pre-packaged and pre-seasoned cubes of potatoes.  Very disappointing.  The restaurant shouldn't call this item \"house potatoes\" if they aren't made in house.  There were no jellies or jams on the table and none were brought to us with our meals.  Maybe the stale toast wasn't worthy of any jelly?  We had to ask the waiter for jelly and he offered only strawberry jam. Take it or leave it.  Overall, a poor meal.  We had thought about going to Ocean One for their $5 lunch, but decided against it after having such a bad experience at breakfast.",

We met some family here after a day of travel,  not our choice but they could get a big group in so that was good.  The location is great and the views are nice. Our waiter was kind, attentive and split a check for our groups which I know can be annoying.  The Caesar salad had potential but the lettuce tasted wilted. My husband did not like the pizza at all. Much of our group kind of played with their food and pushed it around the plate. My sister in law didn't even eat her green beans, they weren't cooked long enough. I had the scallops which wasn't bad, not amazing, it came with some beets also that were really good.   We paid about $100 for four people with tip. The food just is not worth a return trip for us.",

Want top shelf? 3 for $12 or 3 for $14 depending on what you want. You'll struggle to beat these prices in Vegas.   But wait! There's more and it comes in the form of an everything $4.99 lunch menu that is available until 5pm. They even have a good selection of items on their lunch menu and as I said everything is under $5. Go for lunch and you can leave drunk and full or just drunk, maybe just full. Whatever your preference is.   The food: the portion sizes are a bit smaller than the dinner plates which is to be expected but are still filling. I ordered the Greek chicken salad and the sirloin (only $5 why not get both right). I asked for medium and my steak was cooked correctly and well seasoned. The potatoes are a bit bland and I didn't get much from the sauce for the steak but overall I was satisfied. As for the salad I REALLY love the dressing they put on that Greek salad. The chicken on top was pretty basic but I would order it again based on the salad dressing alone. Overall definitely worth the money and a steal if you ask me.",

Cheapest cocktails that didn't taste like water we had the entire trip.   We were a large group of 15 so we figured it would be a not so smooth dinner but it ended up being fine other than the fact that at first the waitress said she could not/would not separate our checks and that it needed to be one check. We understood but then once she took our orders individually on the iPad screen she has we realized we were already separated by seat and re asked if we could just pay per seat and she seemed annoyed by complied.   Also regarding pay issues, I ordered a $3.50 side Caesar and was charged $7.99. She was already 75% done with going around the table collecting our payments when it was my turn and I brought it up. She said she would have to void everyone's and restart and it was too embarrassing for me to have her do that just to save $4 so I said I'd just buy it because she mentioned if she gave me cash it would come from her tips and i felt bad. After back and forth of her saying she feels bad and me saying don't worry about it, she handed me $4 cash and said she'll sort it out later. It was pretty awkward for me since It was an ordeal over 4 freaking dollars.   Okay back to the food. I went out on a limb and got the filet mignon because I was craving one and yelp said it was decent. I'm glad I did, it was good, but I shouldn't of ordered medium well. I was nervous it would be under cooked but it ended up being over cooked, completely brown. Flavor was good though.   A ton of us got the $7 burger and fries and enjoyed them mainly because they were $7.   The tablecloths were paper but no crayons so I'm not exactly sure what the point was... maybe less laundry?   Overall it was good and I'd go back, especially with the major deals they have on food and drink. Amazing prices.   It is inside the miracle mile mall at Planet Hollywood.",

We saw the menu and it had 5$ lunch items and 3 for 10$ drinks and we obviously were in.  They waiter was nice and we all got lunch off of the 5$ entrees. I got the buffalo chicken wrap and I thought it was delicious. It also is a fair amount of food for 5$. I know a lot of places sometimes cut portion sizes with cheaper meals, but this meal would fill you up.  They also have so many drink options. I ended up spending 20$ on drinks and 5$ on food and left full and drunk, haha. Not buzzed. My friends and I agreed we all liked our meals and our drinks. This place obviously is not 5 star restaurant, but it is a good deal for good food. I am going back to Las Vegas in October and planning on stopping here once.",

They offer name brands and if you want top shelf, it's only $5 more.  How awesome is that!?   When I visited, it was still lunch time (4:30pm) pricing on their menu which is $5 for everything.   I expected small portions and mediocre food for it being so cheap, but once the food arrived I was totally proved wrong for that notion.   These meals were so flavorful and sized perfectly.   I cannot say enough great things about this restaurant and can't wait to go back!!",

Is this the most gourmet meal available in Vegas, no but you are also not paying horribly inflated prices for a celebrity chef name. We had the tuna tartare and calamari for appetizers and the tuna won hands down. The salmon dish was well cooked and tasty. The chicken was tender and tasty.   Drinks...oh my - the 3 for $10 is the real deal. You can't find this anywhere else with actual name brand alcohol on the strip. But the drinks alone make this a perfect lunch stop - cheaper than gambling for sure.   Get in here - you won't regret it and your wallet will appreciate the break from other high priced joints o",

There's more!  3 not 2 but 3 drinks for the ridiculous price of $10.   And very decent drinks!   I had a Moscow mule that was a little too sweet so I swapped to my favorite, dirty Martini.   It was so amazing!   Not everyone gets the dirty martini as I Like it: filthy!   When in Vegas, pay a visit.  Especially if your budget is that of NORMAL people.",

Actually I had my birthday dinner here.  8 oz. filet mignon for $22.00.  Cooked perfectly; medium rare.  Frozen cocktails $3.00, draft beer $3.00, bottled beer $3.00, Bloody Mary $7.00, and 3 cocktails for $10.00.  Daily lunch menu - $5.00 between 12p to 5p.  And same drink prices as mentioned.  Sure, this isn't fine dining; however, the food is plated and served to you.  The servers all carry a tablet where they key in your food order.  Later when it's time to pay the bill, same thing.    I can't believe we ate here 3 times over 5 days.  Several reasons include conveniently located across the street from our timeshare; extreme heat 100+ degrees made for difficult walking; and great menu selection with very affordable pricing.",

Order again she sugest me ... im trying to explain to her and she left me hanging there till she sits a couple which walks in. Really i have an issue and you assist other clients. I asked  for the manager which tells that our website isnt trustable if you want correct order come here to order  on the bar. In few statements he told me: What you expected because the food is so  cheap. I have no control or reposability for orders online. Our website is relly messed up. If you dont want deal with situations lile that dont order or eat here anymore. I cant honor anything. I cant give corporate or owner phone number. We dont give customer  service numbers away. If you order here is only a dollar more if the money is not a problem for you. So after again he told me for $ 1 dollar more each plate he will be nice and give me a soda to make even because i paid more to order insite. To make short the whole thing customer service sucks if was a zero star that is what they deserve.",

It's either the server is lying to us or Yelp, Google and their website needs to update their time. Very unhappy!",

    "text": "I unfortunately have to give this cafe a very poor review for many reasons. I was in Las Vegas with a group of friends for the weekend and when we woke up after a long Friday night we were STARVING. We were staying right behind the mile of shops and decided to walk in there and find somewhere to grab breakfast/lunch. We had the choice of a few places, but we liked what was on the special board for Ocean One and decided to give it a try. Boy did we regret that decisions almost right away!      The place was not crowded at all. There were customers of course, but many open seats. We were seated right away, but then waited..and waited...and waited. Finally our waitress came over and took our drink order. We again...waited. Once our waters (and other drinks) arrived we were not given a refill for the rest of our meal. I ordered the grilled chicken and mashed potatoes which were actually quite good. Four of the people in our party ordered different wraps and every single one of them said they were the worst wraps they have had. None of them took more than a few bites and we had to stop to get them hot dogs when we left.       The food wasn't horribly priced for Las Vegas, but we did wait a ridiculously long time for our waitress to collect our checks and bring back our cards. One of my friends paid in cash and the waitress must have been out of change because she brought back only cash and not the coin change....and rounded DOWN instead of just giving my friend the extra dollar.       I won't be coming back here.",

The service was horrible even the restaurant was not full. We waited for about 20 minutes before the Restaurant manager noticed we have not been served. She came over and took our drink orders. We then placed our orders for dinner. We waited for 40 minutes, the server is not even care to come check our drinks or ask if we need anything. The next table came in after us and was served. We then asked the server:  Me: Excuse me, can you please check on our orders Server: Ok, will do  She didn't come back until we called her. At this time, I am ready to walk out. We told her:  Me: We'd like to cancel our order, please bring my bill for the drinks Server: Why? (Yes, a single word, why?) Me: It took forever, and we can no longer wait Server: It's coming  She left after that and come back after 10 minutes with our food and literally thrown the dishes on the table. I asked her to bring me my bill. She came back with a full bill with all of our orders even I was specifically ask to cancel my food order. At this time, I asked her for the service manager who offered a free meal which we refused and left.  A very frustrated and disappointed feeling!",

Since we were already at Planet Hollywood for a show...we figured we'd check Groupon to see if any of there restaurants had a deal before dining. And hey what do ya know...Ocean One popped up.   Walked in and immediately got weird vibes. No greeting from workers...but at the same time...couldn't tell who was working or not being that they were all in their own sweaters. Odd for a place that looks classy..from the outside.  Get to our table which was also strange because they had a piece of butcher paper over a white linen table cloth.   Saving on linen cleaning?   There are some beautiful looking light fixtures throughout the restaurant but....none of them were on.  Saving on electricity?  Basically....looked like it WAS a beautiful classy steak and seafood restaurant that was taken over by someone that has no clue.  Server greeted us with 2 waters and a blank stare...then asked what she could get for us. I ordered a Pinot Grigio. My husband asked what was on tap and got another blank stare and \"um...we have Pinot Grigio....and....Stella and Blelue Moon\". He orders his beer, and we both look at eachother in awe. What on earth was that?!? Lol. Weird.  We then notice our water glasses were filthy so my husband asked for another. Then we get our beverages and my wine glass had some disgusting stuff on it. Geez. Really?!?  I know it sounds like we're drama diners but we really aren't. Just letting you know what to expect.  I ordered the Miso Salmon..$18.99 and husband ordered the Chicken Breast $15.99. All in all...pretty good. No major complaints.  Got our check and noticed they automatically put gratuity on there. So make sure you check it!! We usually tip more than what was included on there but because our server never bothered to let us know, we did not leave extra. Their loss.  Try it for yourself but you get what you pay for.  Its just an odd environment, we'll just say that Groupon got us in but, we won't be returning. Should've dined at the Oyster Bar just a few steps away.",

My guy had the burger and I had a bite it was a semi decent patty but still probably bought from a store in the freezer section.

The first day our group had omlets and some had bagles with smoked salmon and fruit. Yes, very good and for $10! Good choices and the food was good for the price. One complaint was the toast came cold so the butter didn't melt, but over all good quiet place to start your day. Oh Yes, the service was very friendly and patient.",

We got into the restraunt at about 6pm and left at 720pm on Monday June 19th. we were literally the only people in the restraunt. Food was not made to order, and it took 30 minutes to get. I had to ask our waiter 3 times for our check, and the waiter had to ask us 2 times on how the check was split 2 seperate times in a 5 minute span . while we were waiting, we were watching him serve others while waiting for the check to come to our table. None of the workers have any sense of urgency to make sure customers are okay. We had to ask 2 times get our water refilled. After Waiting 20 minutes to pay for our check, I had to take initiative to ask 3 workers to pay for my check which all 3 told me that they can not help me. The last worker I asked to pay out my bill told me I had to ask my waiter to pay it out. By this point I'm already iratable because of the fact that no one could help me but our waiter. Raising my voice to try to get someone to help me. The manager passes by as I'm raising my voice with his worker and does not even acknowledge me. So I go back to my table as I wait But I see the manager behind the counter on his cell phone. I approached him to address the situation. And all he was able to say is sorry. Not even as a manager did he further assist the situation. We just paid and left which we shouldn't have.",

The ambiance of the restaurant was wonderful; high end decor and pleasingly quiet to the normal cacophony of noise with most Las Vegas restaurants.

As for the food....presentation excellent and practical portions of food that left one completely satisfied and tasted excellent.

It was refreshing to see baked chicken, vegetables, and pasta add options versus sandwiches.    I ordered the chicken breast meal for $6.99. I have a lot of allergies, and the staff was very accommodating.  They didn't season any of my food (due to my allergies) but nothing a little lemon juice couldn't fix.    It wasn't spectacular, but it was a healthy option for cheap, which can be challenging to find on the Vegas Strip.",

And it's August in Las Vegas.  You could at least ask if we wanted more water (after we drank all of ours 10 minutes in - she never refilled).

Although they didn't seem particularly busy, they might have been understaffed in the kitchen or on the floor. It took our server many moons between appearances, and it was overall a sloth-like breakfast service.  We were drawn in by the low prices outside and didn't want to insult Vegas by doing McD's on day 1. We figured it couldn't be that bad, and we were right, but it also wasn't that good. There's an array of $6 menu items and a two-for-one drink deal ($10). I chose the mimosa and the mojito; he chose the mimosa and the Almond Joy (overwhelming Kahlua taste).  I had the biscuits & gravy, which were very mediocre. I guess it wasn't a fair choice since I grew up with Southern cooking, and bland gravy is a crime. I splashed Tabasco on to make it more interesting.  Just keep wandering or accept that your meal will be very average and very slow. This is nothing above diner food for breakfast. I think I've had better from IHOP.",

    "text": "First off, I'm going to get straight to the point and state this restaurant's service is absolutely horrible.   This was the second time I visited the Ocean One restaurant while being in Vegas, and I recommended the food to others. My first experience was okay, just like any other restaurant, however on my second visit i know I will never be back.   When seated, my group of friends asked for waters, with lemons. Our waitress acknowledged she would bring us lemons, and she didn't. While we waited we finished our waters, and when she finally came by our table, one of us asked her for the lemons. The waitress simply made a \"mm\" sound as acknowledgement. She brought the lemons a bit later, and by then, our cups of waters were empty.  We then asked her if we could have refills on our drinks, and she again took awhile to refill them. Keep in mind we should not have to keep reminding her for refills when we clearly don't have any water or drinks.   Soon after our orders arrived, and we began to eat. Again, no refills on our waters, and not once did she stop by and ask us how we were doing or if we needed anything. Actually, she didn't even come near us, at all, for us to flag her down.  We talked amongst ourselves and agreed she didn't deserve a good tip, if any. We finished eating and sat at the table, with no bill. We were in no rush to leave, however if we were we clearly wouldn't have been able to since she wasn't checking on us to bring one anyway.  One of our members got up and asked her for our bill, and shortly later she brought it to us. We were upset due to the gratuity being added to each and every ticket in our group, which consisted of approximately 4$. We strongly felt as if she did not deserve that, so again, a member went to an employee and complained about the automatic gratuity, and asked to speak with the manager. The employee then walked over to our waitress, who was in fact the manager.   We were amazed to discover this, due to the service being so horrendous and her not knowing any better on how to manage a restaurant   The manager, who's name was Antonella, be came really snotty and told us there was nothing she could do, and that the gratuity was automatic. We realized there was nothing we could do, so we just told her the service was not worth what we were being forced to tip.      Antonella then replied (without an apology) that it is not her fault and she had a full house.  We looked around and the place was half empty. Free tables everywhere. She then turned her back to us once we pointed this out.   Over all, this was a horrible experience and I will be back.",

But I have many times placed an order online and let me tell you their food is delicious and the best part it's super affordable $4.32 for a meal! I honestly don't think you will find cheaper here in Vegas not even McDonalds is that cheap at the strip lol.  I place my order online and is always ready in a timely manner. I go pick it up I just say my email name and they hand me my food. Every time I go the restaurant is full so I'm guessing service is good and they also have lunch specials I think it's $5 there still a great price.  If you're tired of spending a lot of money on food check this place out you won't be disappointed and if you are at least it didn't cost you more than $5 lol",

And by food items I mean every food item on the menu, from their lollipop wings to their grilled salmon entree.   Came here on a November visit from NYC and was pleasantly surprised. I honestly dont know how they pull this deal off but man it is absolutely unbeatable.   On its own I dont think  the food would warrant me giving ocean grill 5 stars. Dont get me wrong the food is good just not 5 stars good but when I think about how nice our waiter was and the fact I spent $25 got 3 Long Island Ice Teas, 8 lollipop wings and a grilled salmon salad there isnt any other way to rate that but 5 stars.   If youre spending your time like everyone else in \"Lost Wages, Nevada\" you cant afford to turn down this deal. Its the best deal on the Strip imho.   It was so good I came back 3 hours later to catch the lunch deal one more time before it ended lol.",

Just the pancakes were a bit dry.  By that time it was lunch. Lunch starts at 11:30-5pm.  Lunch menus are very reasonable @ $4.99 and Spirit drinks 3 for $10. We decided to try the Crispy Calamari.

Others at my table ordered omelets w/breakfast potatoes and French toast.   Based on this experience I would have given them 5 stars.  Everyone was so impressed that we returned for breakfast again two days later.   Our second outing was totally different.  Everyone's (three people) toast came out cold.  One person at the table asked to have jalapenos added to his cheese omelet. When it came out he asked again if jalapenos had been added and he was assured that they had been.  He cut through the entire omelet and did not find a single jalapeno.  When he pointed this out to the server he was given a small bowl of pickled jalapenos on the side (just sad).  I ordered the biscuit and gravy.  The biscuit was cold under white gravy with no seasoning.  It tasted like flour and milk - not appetizing.  I'm giving them a 3 out of 5 because our first breakfast was so nice, but I can tell you that no one in our group will go here for breakfast again.",

By the time I gulped that down, my salad came and I went straight for my second drink: Paradise punch. Also good!  For cheap drinks, they pack the right punch.

My husband and I stopped in for the third day in a row. Every last bartender overlooked us. Waited on folks to the left and right of us. When one customer tried to tell her that we had a question she ignored that and proceed to tell him about last night's chill with balsamic added. When we spoke to her she said you are free to flag me down. Now what would you like to drink. I spoke to the manager who seems to be obvious to what is taking place behind the bar when he was standing behind the bar. If i could give them less than one star I would. Before this I was a fan of this place and would have recommended them to all. Now I will not recommend to anyone. Customer service is not hard folks.",

Didn't acknowledge my friend, didn't ask her if she wanted anything, how the special works, is this your first time, asked if we wanted to eat....NOTHING.   Keep in mind I get 3 drinks... to order them we had to happen to catch her walking by, repeating EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME EXCUSE ME ... she never came to check on us, never asked if I was ready for my next drink, if we need anything else.

We were very hungry after getting off the plane and finally making it to our hotel.   This restaurant has great food & reasonable pricing. Our Waiter \"Olsin Mejia\" was not very polite or accommodating, he took our order and walked away without any communication. Another waiter brought our food out and promised to return & bring us ketchup & mayo. After waiting patiently for about 3-5 minutes while our food was getting cold, I finally flagged down another waiter and told her what we needed, she walked to a nearby cash register and gave us the squeeze out mayo and ketchup that is usually for to go orders. Wow!   If OLSIN MEJIA comes to your table suggest another waiter so that you can enjoy you meal and not have to wonder about what did you do or say to him to receive poor service. I asked my wife if there is one word to describe how she felt after OLSIN'S Service? She responded with the word \"DEVALUED!\" HE SEEMED BITTER TOWARDS US FOR NO APPARENT REASON. He never smiled or said thank you not once, not even when he brought us our check. As if to say \"I don't need your tip!\" My wife and I have a policy that whoever serves us always receive a tip and we consider ourselves generous tippers when we served. Poor service reaps a poor tip and good service receives a good tip etc. But everyone get's a tip.   We decided to give this restaurant another try a few days later for breakfast, ANNA our waiter was GREAT.. Patient and very suggestive with our menu. She continued to come back and check on us and she made you feel welcome and valued. I am so glad we returned. This restaurant would have received (5) stars if not for the terrible treatment from OLSIN MEJIA. Either he doesn't like his job or he doesn't like people period.",

    "text": "I can't say that this place is horrible and I can't say this place amazing... so it deserves three-stars.  To get straight to the point, the lunch deal at this place is surreal. $5 lunch?! I mean what a DEAL. They have a great selection to choose from considering it's only $4.99! The food quantity they give you is actually pretty decent, enough to kind of fill you up, kind of. The pasta dishes in my opinion probably are the best deal or the burgers. The pasta is filling and a good portion.   Flavor-wise, the food is seasoned well and actually yummy. I loved considering the meal was so cheap. The alcohol here, is also a great deal but if you've been drinking since 7 AM like I was it's a bit too much alcohol. I mean 3 drinks for $10. Definitely screaming alcohol poisoning (lol kidding, but it's a lot considering the three drinks can't be shared). It's also great that the $10 on alcohol cover a variety between cocktails, beer, wine, and liquor.   Food comes out pretty quick and drinks come out quick too, so if you're hungry you really don't have to wait that long for your food to come out. Which is a plus, sort of.   The downside as to why this place earns three-stars? The wait for a table is ridiculous. On a weekday this place was packed and we had to wait about 20-25 minutes. There was no place to sit while waiting. Quality of the food is good but also disappointing because you can tell they make their food well in advance, or in large batches. My pasta dish was flavorful don't get me wrong but the pasta was all clumped together and definitely over cooked.   Another downside was that their appetizer which were their chicken wings, stated it came with eight (8) pieces on the menu but when they brought it out, it came with only five (5). I wouldn't mind only getting 5 pieces if the menu said it was going to come with 5, because I legit was looking forward to having two pieces since our group was four. The wings also weren't really what you'd think chicken wings to be, they were more like chicken lollipops. But nevertheless, good.   The tacos my friend got apparently \"were the worst chicken tacos ever. The chicken wasn't even shredded but instead was a boiled chunk of chicken. Disgusting\" is what was said about them, so save your money, the tacos aren't worth it.   Overall, if you want cheap priced food, this is the place to go. Food is cheap, drinks are cheap and this is a place to go if you want to get a good buzz going. This place gets three-stars but I definitely could see myself coming here again for a decent meal, especially if I have a half-hour or so to kill.",

And by outdoor, it's pretty much tables set outside of the restaurant, since you're still inside the Miracle Mile Shops building.   We were shown to our table quickly and given menus. After placing our order of Grilled Chicken Club Sandwich, Half Pound Sirloin Burger, and the Grilled Atlantic Salmon, we eagerly awaited our food to come. It took a bit of time to arrive, which was a bummer because we were hungry!   The Chicken Club was pretty good and came with crunch fries. The Sirloin Burger was decent. I don't think there was anything too special about that; a pretty standard burger. The Salmon was good, but the rice it came with was not fully cooked.   Overall, the food was decent. The favorite was the Chicken Club: it was nice and juicy.",

    "text": "Oof. This was a rough go for sure. We came in before the Gwen Stefani show and it was moderately busy. Sit down restaurant in the Miracle Mile shopping area of Planet Hollywood hotel/casino. Very loud.   The wait time was not bad for a Friday night. When we were seated, however, our table was literally in front of exit doors and a server station. We were jostled, and bumped quite a bit. We ordered salads: Cobb for myself, chicken Caesar for hubby. We got our order fairly quickly, but no silverware. When we asked for silverware we were told the hostess was supposed to bring us silverware. We asked three different people for silverware. When our waiter finally brought silverware to our table there was no apology, but rather he stated \"if you have a problem, talk to the manager.\" So, we did. The manager apologized and told us they were out of silverware. Super sigh.   The food was decent tho, in spite of the crap ambiance, the terrible service, and the lack of silverware to eat a freaking salad with.",

We started out with the hot spinach artichoke dip and chips. It was so good! Creamy, warm with a lot of spinach and chopped artichokes.   Next came tacos. My husband ordered the beef tacos and I ordered the chicken.  The beef tacos were flavorful and delicious. The chicken tacos weren't so great. The chicken wasn't shredded and it was dry and cold. After one taco, I sent it back and they kindly took it off my bill. You get 3 tacos and a side dish for $4.99.   I ordered the orecchiette pasta and it was AMAZING!! The lemon garlic sauce is creamy and so tasty!! The tomato's were a mixture of Roma and Heirloom. They were bursting with flavor!!   The restaurant was busy, but efficient. We were seated right away and our waitress was prompt, friendly and accommodating.   I highly recommend this place. You cannot find this quality of food on the Las Vegas Strip for such a bargain price.",

    "text": "This place is a go to for lunch! My friend told me there is this place that serves $5 lunch dishes every single day. So I had to try this place out.  There was a ton of people outside the restaurant when we got there, but the line kept moving so we didn't even wait that long.  When we sat down, it took a while for our server to take our order or acknowledged us. We noticed the people who sat down after us was already being served. After meeting our server, we saw how many tables he was helping so we let it slide. He was so helpful the entire night and made sure we were taken care of, they we gave him a 30% tip!  What we ate:  1. Calamari - Hmm... The calamari had some kind of marinara sauce on the bottom of the bowl. I think to add some color. I never had them like this. The calamari became a bit to soggy since it was sopped in that sauce, but we can't complain because it was only $5.  2. Artichoke Dip and Chips - The artichoke dip was good. The quality was like what you get from Applebee's. I think it may have been sitting there a little too long because it didn't look melty or cheesy. But again, $5.  3. Steak Quesadilla - My husband's favorite. It came with a bit of sour cream, guacamole, and salsa on the side. He didn't need it because he says it was already flavorful.  4. Cheeseburger - The cheeseburger was nice and juicy, but my only complaint would be the cheese on top. It was a perfect square so you know they took it out of that krafts clear plastic wrap and three the processed cheese on top.  5. Penne Pasta - The penne Pasta was just ok. There wasn't much flavor in the pasta sauce. But again, only $5.  6. Steak - My husband enjoyed his steak, but didn't really care if the veggies and mashed potatoes.  Everything was good for $5. We would definitely come back to try the other things on the menu. I think we got a little too much for two because we got judging eyes from the other tables. Lol! They don't know foodies until you become a foodie!",

The service, however, is terrible. I don't completely blame them since they're so busy, but we had to wait for over 20 minutes for a table (party of 6, but a party of 8 got sat immediately even though they arrived 15 minutes after we did, and when I asked about it, they said bigger parties are given preference).  Once we sat down, it was at least another 15 minutes before our server came and everything from then on was super slow. Appetizers and entrees were out before our first round of drinks made it out, it took forever to get our checks, we weren't given straws for the frozen drinks ordered (one of my colleagues tried drinking hers from the glass and it wouldn't budge, until it all came crashing on her face), and we waited at least 10 minutes between finishing appetizers and receiving entrees.  So if you want affordable food and have 2.5 hours to waste on a subpar lunch, this is your spot. (Tbh, I'd come back just because of the prices in contrast to the rest of the Strip, but if I found another affordable place nearby, I would never come back)",

At first I was a little worried about how the food here could be so inexpensive, especially for a restaurant on the strip. They have a large sign on the front advertising their $5 lunch menu and I think that brought lots of shoppers in.  I was pleasantly surprised!! I ordered the Caribbean Mahi Sandwich with fries and it was yummmy but just a little dry. The fries are soooo good. I also ordered a strawberry daiquiri and I can't believe it was only $3! My friends really enjoyed their food as well. This place is such a great restaurant to eat at if you happen to be on the strip. As a local I'm never on the strip but I will definitely remember this place the next time I'm nearby. It is good food and drinks at fast food prices!",

    "text": "I was so intrigued by the $5 lunches and many youtube las vegas videos recommended this place. I looked it up on yelp and of course this place has mixed reviews, I notice that tends to happen with AYCE or places where you're getting the best deal you can. People have really high expectations and get mad disappointed.  Alright, so lets talk real fast: The food was really amazing for the deal. This food wasn't like life changing but it reminded me of a quality outing at your local restaurant chain... but even better because its only $5. I couldn't complain.  We got the following:  Calamari - People complained about this being undercooked but mine was super crispy and delicious. Tuna Tartare - A smaller dish but I really liked it. For the portion, I felt very satisfied. Had a lot of avocado, yum! Ocean One Wings - Sweet and sticky wings, they were slightly crispy and hit the spot. My boyfriend enjoyed them. Orecchiette Pasta - This was a huge portion for $5! Pretty delicious with a light cream sauce that wasn't too heavy. Salmon - Okay I'm always skeptical of salmon but heard this was pretty good. My boyfriend who rarely orders salmon and hates dry salmon really liked it. It's better than places that serve dry salmon for $17. A great value.  Was this the best most life changing gourmet food? No! Did this hit the spot and keep our wallet happy? Yes!  We ate at the bar and the service wasn't bad but it wasn't the best excellent. They were super busy and everyone at the bar was rushing around, cleaning, taking checks, etc. They were in between changing shifts so it got a little hard for people to order. Honestly I didn't mind. for a $5 food, the servers were attentive enough and got my orders in a decent time. You could tell they were hard working and just trying to get everyones orders in.  Also, I'll definitely come back here if I stay close by, the freakin cocktail deals are amazing. $10 for 3 cocktails (all day) and you can take it to go! I wasn't in the mood to drink but the $3 frozen slush was too good to pass up. If you want to, you can even walk up and ask to buy drinks to go. I noticed a lot of takeout orders as well, I might try that for their lunch deal next time!! Amazing.  My advice is to come in with low expectations and just remember that you're getting a deal. I was pleasantly happy and very full.",

Nice thing they have is scrolling screen out front with your name and how long you have waited.  Folks had pasta, burger, wings, salmon, mahi sandwich, lava cake, and 3 cocktails for $10. Everyone liked their meal. I had the salmon salad with rice and beans (pictured). Nice piece of salmon on bed of greens. Perfect size for a reasonable lunch. Easy credit card pay with their mobile square devices.   We were chatting, but they have some great TVs if you want to watch the game.   Located in the miracle mile shops connected to Planet Hollywood.  On this visit service was really good, but have had mediocre service on other visits. But for quality  $5 lunch on the strip,  can put up with mediocre service.",

I have walked around the Miracle Mile Shops looking at the menus of various places, but until now, I hadn't eaten in this area.  The Groupon gave me the excuse to go.  I had a reservation for 5 PM, unneeded as it turned out.  I looked at the menu while my server, Tracy, brought my iced tea.  For a starter, I ordered the sesame tuna.  It was  5 pieces of tuna, previously seared and arranged on a bed of seaweed salad with wasabi cream and pickled ginger topping the salad.  The tuna was dry.  It was just stored too long before being used.  The plating was certainly nice but the dryness was very noticeable.  For the main, I ordered the filet, cooked blue.  The server returned from another table and checked with me to make sure that's what I wanted before putting the order in to the kitchen.  See the photo to see that it was cooked the way I wanted it.  A plus vote for that.  Along with the filet were some mashed potatoes and some yellow and green squash stings with carrot strings.  The vegetables were very good--crisp and not overdone.  For dessert, I got the Peanut butter cheesecake.  It was good and had a nice peanut butter flavor.    Overall, the meal was OK.  I'm glad I tried it once but I probably wouldn't come back.  I was disappointed with the tuna appetizer.  Without the Groupon, the dinner would be very similar in pricing to some of the steakhouses at Strip hotels.  There are better choices with nicer atmospheres.",

Apparently he almost got into a fight in the restaurant. So his attitude is sooo poor. One day I made a to go order at the bar, one of the ladies told me about how you can get your food for $3.99 online , lol I was shocked that I never knew that.

Both experiences were great except the service was slow (and one not so friendly - tho not rude either). The first visit was for dinner, both my husband and I ordered steak and lobster for $27 each! Can't go wrong. Both the filet mignon and lobster were delicious and cook perfectly. We also ordered spinach dip, again good. All day long, you can get 3 alcoholic beverages for $10. I thought the drinks would be watered down but I was wrong! You can mix and match from their list of wines, beers, specialty drinks, etc. my 3rd drink I was able to take to go!  The next morning with friends, we decided to have breakfast there and ordered steak and eggs for $13 and again the 3 for 10 drinks! Highly recommend this place if you're near planet Hollywood. Took 1 star away for the service.",

Boy was I in for a surprise.   Upon receiving my meal, I noticed that the pasta looked watery. There was cheese sprinkled on top, so deep down I hoped that would be the meal's saving grace. After two bites, I was immediately turned off, and glad that I had the calamari appetizer to make up for this basic entree.  My mother saw that I barely touched my food and asked the waitress to see if we could switch my meal for a burger. The waitress seemed a little peeved, but nonetheless helped us to make the switch.  However, in all honesty, the burger wasn't much of an improvement. My burger was medium cooked, since I like the moisture, but not really seasoned well. The cheese that I had to pay extra, I could barely taste.   I feel this place is one that I would not go out of my way to have a meal at. The service is okay, but food quality, particularly with the seasonings needs to substantially improve. It's one of those places where you definitely get what you pay for.",

They have an incredible lunch where everything on the menu is $5 and drinks are 2 (or 3?) for one for most 'basic' drinks like beers, wines by the glass, etc, and delicious frozen drinks are something like $4. Honestly, it is the best value in Las Vegas and the quality is outstanding. We usually sit at the bar so we can't comment on the table service, but the bartenders are usually terrific.  Our go-to here is the warm goat cheese salad. OMG, this is the best salad ever. I have been known to eat two of them in one sitting. It is a DELICIOUS light salad of mixed greens, pine nuts, a panko crusted patty of goat cheese that is lightly pan fried, and a wonderful sun dried tomato vinaigrette. Sooooooo yummy! We have, of course, tried other things on the menu and they have all been good. The wings were tasty, but not outstanding. The burger is hearty and a good, solid choice. Hubby had a delicious pasta dish one year that he loved. In general, we haven't ever had something that we disliked here.  The location is buried back in the Miracle Mile shops at Planet Hollywood and it is usually busy, but if you get there before the lunch rush, or if you sit at the bar, you can usually walk right in. Definitely a 'must do' for anyone looking for a budget meal, delicious flavors, and ice cold, well priced drinks!  (They also have a delicious and extensive dinner menu which is well priced as well, but the $5 lunch cannot be beat!)",

It's refreshing to find a place where the quality of the food exceeds the cost to eat it. They also have a great special for drinks. Where else are you going to find 3 drinks for $10?",

    "text": "My dad and I were looking for an inexpensive place to eat breakfast inside the Miracle Miles. Lord behold, we came across the Ocean One Bar and Grille boasting a variety of omelette combos for under $10 and other breakfast foods like pancakes and toast.   Place was packed to the max at 9 am on a Saturday morning and it was clear there weren't enough servers to accommodate the masses of people. Even though it only took 5 minutes to seat us, it wasn't for another 30 minutes until our actual food came. My dad ordered a coffee and our waitress forget about it until I reminded her. Bless her heart though, she was overworked. She had a section of 7-8 tables all to herself.  She was friendly to us, refilled our waters once and didn't charge us for the coffee.   Food was exactly what I expected: simple and appetizing. Our omelettes came with potatoes and toast. Omelettes were yummy but our potatoes were a bit dry. For a $10 breakfast at a major strip restaurant that's not called Denny's, I will take what I can get.   I would definitely come here over Planet Dailies (24/7 diner inside Planet Hollywood). Food is just as good if not better, and cheaper. Bring some good friends and conversation over to Ocean One Bar & Grill and prepare to wait it out for your food.",

    "text": "Pretty sure this is the kind of place where if employees got asked on a anonymous survey if they would eat there, their response would be \"hell no!\" - because seriously, only God knows how can they have fish, steak and all sorts of items for $5.  I know, I'm guilty for stopping by. On a work trip and trying to splurge at fancy dinner tonight without overdoing my per-diem I figured I needed a cheap lunch. And this place is cheap. Like I said, everything is $5 on lunchtime. And all beers are $3. This is actually a pretty good deal. Since you can't really mess up a Stella Artois...   Well, but then you get what you pay for. Service is horrendous. I sat at the bar, fairly empty at 2pm, two bartenders super busy cleaning all the bottles. Food takes forever. Comes without silverware. I sit there in desolation hoping for some compassion until someone looks at me and laughs when I ask for utensils.   They don't care. Everyone at the bar was looking at each other laughing because that's actually pretty messed up. I know it's cheap but come on, have some decency. Ironically the food (although Cary looking) wasn't so bad. Well, let's wait until tonight and see if I'll die or something.  But here's is the deal. I had a fish, a salad and a beer for $13. If you're willing to put up with the crap and ridiculousness of the service, go for it.  Then tonight I'll go splurge at a steakhouse to make it up for it.",

Can't beat those $5 lunch specials.  I ordered the Ahi Tuna wrap, Boy ordered the Burrito.  While neither meal was exception and there was to attention paid to presentation, the food was quite good.  The tuna was fresh and the wasabi sauce gave it a nice kick.  It was reminiscent of the Lark Burger Ahi Tuna Burger (which sells for $10, making this wrap a real steal).  I should also note that they did NOT skimp on the fish.  The $3 Pina Colada I ordered was small, but tasty.  Not terribly boozy, but that's not a problem for me since I'm not a big drinker anyway.   In a part of town where each bottle of water will run you $3-5, this place is an amazing bargain for really decent food.  It also has a much nicer dining area that once would expect for the price. Give it a shot!",

But believing it was lunch and they were full, that this could contribute to the waiter's delay. We ordered water and our food, pretty simple order. Another 10 minutes wait and our water showed up. My water cup 3/4 full (no ice), so I had to order more ice.   Our food shows up. I had ordered Mahi Mahi tacos with chips and salsa. Get ready for it.  THEY SCREWED UP CHIPS AND SALSA!!!   Not kidding, the chips were flimsy the salsa was a cross between orange and clear. Good if you're from New Hampshire, but not even close for SW.   My tacos actually made me gag. The fish was from a can, the cabbage was not fresh and the corn soft. The actually taco was the size of a small wallet. I put the plate on the edge of the table with only taco missing and no chips gone.  So after a few minutes, the waiter finally brings me, my ice, after my water had been refilled by another waiter. And ask if everything is ok? I started to laugh, really my entire plate is sitting to the side and you have to ask if everything is ok.  Like I said Don't do it",

The tortillas could've been grilled versus warmed and I personally DON'T like Chipotle but the marinade on the chicken was not overwhelming. At least there's three.  Drinks are 3, count em, THREE for $10! ONLY IN VEGAS.  Service is quick and attentive.  Overall, just okay for hangovers and VERY quick bites to knock off that pounding \"I'm HANgry\" feel!",

The Ocean One Bar and Grille breakfast menu was out so we decided to take a look. Our party of 9 was seated fairly quick.  Garden Omelette ($8.95): This veggie omelette came with a side of toast (white/wheat) and some potatoes. Portions were a good size for the price. I'm actually surprised the omelette wasn't more, especially dining in at a restaurant inside of a casino! Everything tasted a little bland or very average.  Our waiter messed up on quite a few orders we had (wrong type of bread, incorrect way of how the eggs are cooked, etc). Needless to say, our service wasn't very good the entire stay but I'm sure he didn't really care since we were required to give the 18% gratuity anyways.  There are better brunch places out there!",

    "text": "This place is a hidden gem in the pricey LV area, because where else on The Strip will you be able to find a spot with the entire lunch menu priced at $4.99? It's a bit tricky to find if you're trying to locate it from the outside (walked in a few aimless circles religiously following Google Maps), especially with some recent road construction. But if you happen to be snooping midday around the mall area of Planet Hollywood, definitely hit this place up for a great value.   I ordered the grilled salmon dish, which I found to be a lot more appealing than my friend's skirt steak plate (but to each their own taste buds, right?). The grilled salmon came with a small handful of mixed veggies and a scoop of mashed potato, which was complemented with the lemon herb sauce. It was satisfying, although it does leave you with wanting for a bit more of a meal after you finish. Overall 10/10 would recommend, so definitely come here to stay within your budget!",

My calamari had no taste whatsoever. My steak was ok, I wouldn't spend more than $5 on it. The presentation of my steak was very sad. I had a bite of my husband's burger and it was very dry. I'm glad we didn't spend full price on their food. I'm not sure if their quality changes because of the price but if they're a really good restaurant the quality shouldn't change based on their lunch specials. On top of that our server seemed like his mind was somewhere else. He wasn't really attentive to us. The place was not that busy but it took a while for him to give us our bill. I can see he was more attentive to 2 pretty women that was sitting 2 tables away from us. He saw me waiting for him to take our check and he turned the other way and checked his phone. I grabbed my husband's card and asked the hostess if I can pay there they said no my server would take our payment. I had told him we've been waiting a while for him. And the worse part he had his hands on his hips while waiting for his tip. If it was me paying, I wouldn't give him a tip especially waiting like how he was. I don't think we'll be going back here.",

It's kinda messed up to make mandatory tipping(even though we were going to tip), but to make it 25%? The tip itself was the cost of two entrees LOL.

Arrived at the restaurant after 3pm and asked the host if lunch is still being served. (RED FLAG) She said she wasn't sure and that she was new? I nicely advised her that she may want to familiarize herself w/the serving hours being that she's up front and first point of contact for customers.   My guest and I were promptly seated but waited forever for a server. We actually flagged down someone for a menu. Our server finally appeared and he was all over the place giving excuses about what took him so long and how they called him in on his off day to work etc. etc. I was like at this point all I want is my drink (I love their Pina Colada's) and a bite to eat. Placed drink orders.   About 8mins later server reappeared and we ordered an appetizer (Chips n Artichoke dip) and our meals. Mind you still waiting on our drinks! Finally the drinks arrived n appetizer. Yet we had No napkins nor utensils on the table.   As we proceeded the eat. The cheese in the dip had been over cooked or reheated and had the consistency of Glue! So we scraped it off our plates back into the main dish and advised our server of the problem and requested to have a fresh order. Why this would be a problem? I've still yet to figure it out. The server (who wasn't our original one) came back and said it couldn't be replaced because it had been half eaten. WTF! We both only had taken a bite each. We were shocked and appalled as you could clearly see that wasn't the case! We requested to see the Manager. Out comes this A hole Manny. He took our dish and came back and said the dish was Half eaten?? He said even the cook agreed. Manny left the table and came back with a fresh order and said this is what it's suppose to look like. We explained to him that of course the dish isn't going to look the same as the original one because cheese coagulates once it gets cold. But even Stevie Wonder could see the proportion sizes were pretty much the same. We didn't want anything for Free just a replacement! I still can't believe this A hole brought out a dish to compare instead of just replacing the original bad order. Don't want to play the race card hear. But it appears that hand was dealt to us!!! Manny is one of the Absolute worst managers and is clearly in need of training on customer service and perhaps a New job.  Please view the dish of the supposed to have been Half eaten dish to the fresh one n tell me what you think.",

I saw a few other people who sat down after I ordered my drink who got their food before me. I ended up going to the host and asking to speak to a manager because after an hour and some change I still had not received my food and all I ordered was a hamburger and my friend ordered penne pasta. He approached me very rude and said \"don't you know our system is backed up and that's why it's taking long so be patient\"  and I said I understand but everyone else around me has gotten their food except for me and the person I'm eating with and I said all I want is to speak to a manager. So instead of getting the manager he went and got our waiter which didn't make sense?!?! When the waiter came over he said \"you guys had the mahi-mahi sandwiches right\" we said no then he asked if we had gotten something else and we also told him no and then after him standing there confused for almost a whole minute we said that we will just pay for our drinks and leave. And he said okay and didn't apologize or go get the manager or even say \"your food will be out soon\". Seems to me like he actually never went and put our order in. Will not come back here. Not only was the service extremely slow but when I asked for a manager nobody went and got a manager for me and nobody honestly seemed to care.",

The waitress was very friendly and upbeat. When we left, I realized I accidentally left my sunglasses.

I ordered the same thing I usually order and when I looked down at my order, the portion was almost half as small as the last couple times.   The food was lukewarm at best and lost something between now and two months ago when I last ate here.  We asked the waitress for lemons which she never brought us and when reminded, she didn't acknowledge and gave a snotty look. She did end up bringing us lemons however had to be asked to refill our drinks that were clearly empty. Keep in mind we asked her politely on all occasions.   This was a horrible dining experience and when we received our tab saw that gratuity was already included in our total! Could this be why the waitress seemed to not give a care? Earning money wether or not she performed?  My wife asked at the front to speak to the manager and guess who it was? Yup, you guessed it. Our waitress. Her name was ANTONELLA. Antonella made no attempt to accommodate our group and continued to be snotty. Causing a huge scene in her restaurant and setting a negative example for those working under her. Antonella needs to get with it, or find another job because there's plenty of people out there that need jobs.   P.S. On the way out, I informed a couple inquiring about the restaurant about our experience and they walked the other way. EAT SOMEWHERE ELSE.",

    "text": "BEWARE!!! I went here for their $5.99 breakfast. I ordered my eggs over easy. The eggs and potatoes were fine. The sausages hard as rock. I bet they were cooked and sat under a lamp causing them to get hard. I cut the ends and tossed them. The middle of the sausage was barely edible. I wanted to return the sausages, but thought they would spit on them, drop them on the floor or something. The waitress gave me a choice of white or wheat toast. I said white. She came out with wheat. She didn't say anything until I asked and she answered we're out of white.   I ordered coffee and I should have known better because it was awful.   I paid cash. I didn't know and they should have said something to me, but they don't give out change (coins); they round up or down. There should be a law against that. If they are going to do that, you should be informed first.   I'm never going back to this place. BEWARE!!!",

I actually also came for lunch that same day (although it wasn't by my choice).  Decent food, just nothing memorable or extraordinary.  Breakfast was cheap -- way cheaper than the place across from here. For both breakfast and lunch I had the $5.99 special so not having to spend like $15 on one meal was nice.  I had the poached eggs, bacon and toast. We were also served homemade jam but it was extremely too sweet. Lunch, I came with a bigger group and had chicken breast with vegetables and a really nice soy-based glaze.  Service both times were good (by the same waiter, actually). It was quite slow both times so I'm curious how this place is when it's packed.",

I think they ranged around 6-8 bucks which isn't bad since it is located inside Planet Hollywood.  There was no wait, so we got seated right away. Menus, check.. water, check.. lipstick mark on water glass.. WHAT?????!! Yeah, EW!..   We notified the waitress and she took it away instantly and tried to be very quiet about it. Pretty disgusting :{ which is why I prefer using straws so my lips don't touch those dirty glasses at many places.  Most of us ordered omlettes that come with potatoes and toast.  It was mediocre.. typical breakfast plates.. not bad for the price I guess.  Service was good, water was constantly filled, since I did drink a cup about every 5 minutes... or so. LOL.  I'd probably avoid this place..",

About 15 minutes later the excellent food arrived via a different server.   What didn't arrive was the check, nor any explanation, nor any staff. After waiting 15 minutes after completing the meal I tracked down the hostess. Eventually 25 minutes after finishing the meal, at 10 PM, I was told they had a computer problem and I was not to leave until it was fixed and the bill paid.   I asked how much it was based on the menu prices for what we had. The reply was that this couldn't possibly be determined without the computer, and if I left before paying they would call the cops!  They didn't disclose my maximum term of captivity until they fixed their computer, if that were to take days or weeks. Nor if they would release the kids and only keep the adults as hostages.   Finally 30 minutes after we finished the meal we were presented the bill, but not the 2nd drink we paid for. No adjustment. We paid and went to bed.   Just unbelievable. Got a computer problem? Easy, just hold your patrons hostage and threaten them.",

The only negative, the ribeye was ordered medium rare and no pink was seen when we cut into it. It was pretty much well done.

From the beginning our waitor was very high strung and kept talking over me when I was asking him questions.  I ordered the cajun chicken pasta which was bland.

A group of family and friends converged on Las Vegas to celebrate the new year and my 40th birthday.  One night my son and I decided to try out Ocean One Bar and Grille.  The prices were surprisingly inexpensive (which should have been my first clue - I mean, even the air is expensive in Vegas).  He was excited to order a virgin strawberry daiquiri, but was sorely disappointed when the waitress told him that all their daiquiri's were pre-mixed in machines.  Oh well - so much for that!  We ordered a quesadilla as an appetizer and both had burgers.  The quesadilla was certainly nothing special - even the salsa tasted like it was bottled.  Our burgers came out sans bacon and by the time they got around to bringing us a side of bacon, our burgers were cold.  My son ordered his 'medium', yet when he bit into it, there was no pink to be found.  It was 'well' as can be.  The fries weren't even good - they had a slight \"freezer\" taste to them.    Our waitress whisked our plates off the table while we were still eating (just taking a break).  Before I could say anything, she quickly turned around and said, \"Oh wow, I didn't even ask if you were finished!\" and she put the plates back down.    This place, while easy on the wallet, was totally uninspiring.  I won't be going back during my next trip to Vegas.",

If you need a break from gambling, don't want to eat Burger King, but don't want to pay more, I highly recommend Ocean One. This is a recession, people.

The bread was 10 times deep fried .  We each ordered steak--all were flavorless and NOT TENDER.  My mother in law must have spent at least one minute trying to cut through each steak slice (and 2-3 minutes to chew the piece of steak before swallowing) My husband and I were so embarrassed--we didnt want to cause a scene  in front of mymother in law, so when she decided to leave the restaurant right after our meal for a walk, we took the opportunity to talk to the so called Manager to let him know how we really felt about the food and the service.    I am disappointed to report that all the Manager did was apologize and asked if we wanted a free dessert.  I repeated to him several times that dessert wouldnt fix our horrible experience.  I regret not telling him that I wanted a full refund....In any case, this is a calling to all you Yelper's to save your time and money.

I ordered a delicious pasta primavera dish and had enough left over for breakfast the next morning (it was that good), and my husband enjoyed filet mignon (though, he notes, it was not the kind you can \"cut with a fork\"). The best part of the meal was the complimentary pita bread, showered in butter and cinnamon (even if it was served after we had started our main course). Peanut butter chocolate cheesecake for dessert was a good choice, though a bit standard in taste. The bill was rather steep, and our waiter was totally creepy (we have since remembered him as the Phantom of the Restaurant). BUT the food was yummy and didn't completely break the bank, ie $50 for 2 entrees and a dessert - in Vegas.   Go to Ocean One if: You want a good sized, quality entree with some great pita bread; you have a few pennies to spend; you crave a quiet atmosphere (albeit it's location in a mall); you enjoy creepy waiters!  Don't go to Ocean One if: you are in the mood for a cheap snack; you don't want to spend more than $20 per person; you have high standards for cheesecake!",

That's probably the only thing good about this place.  because we needed to use their WiFi again and hungry too we decided to give them another shot today.  I had the Pepperoni wild mushroom pizza... Hmm. I don't know, but on a 12 inch pizza, shouldn't you have more than 4 slices of pepperoni on it? and shouldn't you have more than 1 mushroom chopped up into 5 pieces? Now I know why this place is cheap. You wouldn't think it to be cheap from the looks of it. The place looks like an upscale restaurant.  They need better cooks back in the kitchen. That's all! If I do go back to this place it will be primarily for their free WiFi.",

    "text": "Located in the Miracle Mile Shopping Mall at the Planet Hollywood, you'll find this little restaurant called the Ocean One Bar and Grille.   They offer seating inside the restaurant and outside in a faux outdoor scene.  We ordered the Margharita Pizza and a house salad, costing nearly $20.00.  Most dinner entrees average between $8-15 here.  The Margarita Pizza (ours about $8.99) was the highlight of our dining experience, mediocre in taste.  The salad, however, could have been better.  Not much of a flavor to be desired as the Vinaigrette tasted different than any we've tried and they doused our salad in it.    Summing up this review, I personally would not give this place another try, but to those looking for a fairly quick and cheap meal in or near Planet Hollywood, this a decent stop.",

We went here for a very late lunch, and didn't get any complimentary anything - I was surprised we even got water.  The inside of the restaurant was actually surprisingly nice - it felt a little out of place, but in my opinion, all of Vegas is an anomaly.  Three people got the pasta dish with an unflavorful red sauce and some veggies.  They all said they could have made it better at home.  I got a mahi-mahi sandwich, and it was pretty decent.  The fries on the side were \"seasoned\", which meant some Cajun salt and pepper.   For what we paid (less than $21 for four meals), we got more than we would have at, say, McDonalds.  The only redeeming quality of the restaurant was that it was very inexpensive.",

The crabcakes were amazing- they were really good and I expected the dinner to be just as amazing- it wasn't. The pasta was the biggest disappointment - my partner couldn't even finish it. The meal did not have any flavor and tasted as if it was old- Applebee's pasta tastes better than this. My surf & turf was also disappointing. The lobster was dry , the mashed potatoes were instant from the box and the steak I requested medium well came to the table basically raw. Overall , I would recommend skipping over this place.

My family and I were walking through the Miracle Mile Shops, seemingly for hours, on our first day in Vegas, and we were starving. We were in dire need of breakfast, and we were impressed by this restaurant's advertised breakfast prices (breakfasts start at $5.99 here! This is in MAJOR contrast to the prices elsewhere).   Since we were there at an off-time (mid-morning), the restaurant was about half empty. We were promptly seated and given menus. They offered a lot of breakfast fare, with a lot of omelet options and other popular dishes. We all ordered a variety of eggs/toast/hash brown potatoes and pancake dishes. All were really good, not greasy (the bacon was really good!), brought to our table promptly. No complaints at all.  Did I mention that the prices were really reasonable?   One weird incident, though: a gal came by our table, large camera around her neck, saying she takes photos of diners at the restaurant as a courtesy and the photos are free and she'd like to take our picture. Our family of four gussies up as best we can (considering we just flew in to town super early that morning and had been walking around for hours, waiting for our hotel room to be readied), and this gal takes our photo. She says she'll return with our complimentary photo shortly, and then she goes to another table to take a picture of the couple there. At any rate, we had ordered our meals and received them and then eaten them, gotten our bill and then paid, and then left. The camera girl never returned. Either she forgot, something shady was going on, or our family's photo was SO hideous that she was embarrassed to present it to us. Very strange, all around.",

I really enjoyed the Mediterranean wrap which included a side of chips. They also had amazing drink prices- $3 beers and 3 cocktails for $10. Wish we had found this place before our last night in Vegas. It felt like the only place in the strip not trying to gouge us for every last cent!",

I came to this place after a disappointing experience at LobsterMe, so they already had an upper hand. Unfortunately, that didn't really help.   **Their Ocean One Wings smell great, and honestly the sauce if pretty tasty. But they need to season or marinate the actual wing because there's no flavor at all. They were courteous enough to take the item off the menu as per my dining partner's request.  ** She and I both order their burger, which is like $6.99. For a $6.99 burger, it's ok, but keep in mind an average chain does it better. Kind of reminds me of a frozen GV patty. It would be better if they upped the price and shot for quality. This would've made the food congruent with the atmosphere. Also, she ordered medium and I medium well...both were well done. To their defense, the burger's too thin to really accomplish medium.",

I couldn't decide what to get so the waitress helped me out. She takes pictures of her food just like me so she showed me some of their dishes. I was sold on the Sea bass which wasn't listed on the menu. The bass was served on top of some mashed potatoes with spinach in a light butter sauce. It was delicious!    I also had the shrimp cocktail as a starter and I tried some seared tuna . I was afraid to try the tuna but I gave it a try it tasted really fresh. I'm thinking about ordering next time I eat here. There will definitely be a next time because the service was wonderful,  food  awesome, and they have 3 for one drinks! I didn't have any that night but next time I'm going to be getting a mango Margarita!",

We work in the area, and frequently took advantage of this restaurants online ordering system. It now takes over thirty minutes for a simple order like bacon and eggs and then even got that wrong.   We really love supporting this place because it's a small business and the quality is still pretty good.  Unfortunately, and the last 6 months they've spent a lot of money on making everything in the restaurant nicer but now it takes up to 35 minutes to order and pick up from online.  Just yesterday we took 35 minutes to order bacon and eggs and nothing else. From the time we put the order in online to the time I was ready to pick up took 35 minutes!  The previous record for waiting for our meal here last week took us 24 minutes.  They've had some staff turn over, and they seem to be a lot busier than they used to be but it's a shame that we will no longer be coming here.  When we're at work we cannot afford to wait 35 minutes in the lobby to pick up scrambled eggs and a few slices of bacon.  To top it all off, they included potatoes when we ask not to have potatoes, and did not give us a fork and a knife for order.  But then again, they have a lot more TVs and spent a whole bunch of money to make it look nice inside..   Maybe the service is better inside?",

No where else on the strip are you going to find drinks that taste so incredibly delicious for such an insanely cheap price. We stopped in this restaurant to grab a few drinks before catching a concert at the Axis theatre inside Planet Hollywood. The hostess sat us quickly and they have a massive dining room which is perfect for a busy Saturday night so guests aren't waiting too long to sit and enjoy their meal. Our server was quick to take our order and very friendly. They have a large food and drink menu so everyone at your table will be able to find something they enjoy. We were able to enjoy a few drinks and a quick bite plus still have plenty of time to catch our show. Very please with the affordable price and great service we received. I'll certainly be going to this fine establishment the next time in down on the strip.",

When we first get there we are met with one of the managers. She talked to us for maybe a minute before we get seated. When we sit down our waitress took our order. Maybe 2 minutes after that we got our drinks and then sat there for maybe 1 hour before we got our food. And remember this is lunch. My mom and dad got burritos and me and my sister got appetizers. While we were waiting our waitress never came to tell us that she was sorry our food wasn't out and she would go check on it. Once we got our food it was all room temperature. While we were eating the waitress never came over to see if we needed anything else until we were done eating. We finally asked for the manager and the waitress never got a tip. Overall the food wasn't Good nor was the service. I give this restaurant a 2/10",

The apple pie dessert was quite good, as was the service from the waiter (especially considering he was left to handle quite a large section by himself).  We sat on the patio, which was nice because you got to experience the \"thunderstorm.\"  What stood out the most was the check.    When we received our check, we noticed the restaurant automatically added gratuity. What makes this even more sketchy is that we were only a party of three and when we got the final check (after the card has been swiped), there was an empty line for gratuity and no mention that you had already paid an 18% tip.  For those people not paying attention, you would end up tipping again on top of an even larger amount.    I actually spoke to the hostess about this because it seemed so blatantly dishonest, and she confirmed this is how they set up their system.  This is an easy way for them to rip off customers, so be aware.",

    "text": "Swung by here for lunch with friends and we were all pretty disappointed in the food we got. I guess it was decent food, but the main trend we noticed was that everything was super salty. My girlfriend ordered the Shrimp Parmesan and it was literally getting a fork full of salt. We had to to-go it and I brought it back to the hotel and recooked it, diluting the dish with water and letting it simmer. It was pretty good after that, but I didn't pay to have to recook my own food. I had the California Wrap which was pretty decent, but nothing special either. My friend had the Talapia and a chunk of his fish was missing from his plate while my other friend ordered a pepperoni pizza that was just tomato sauce and a few pepperonis on a super thin crust. We were pretty unimpressed to be short..  The only silver lining this place has is that their drinks special is quite legit. This is actually where I'm giving it a few stars in this review. Two drinks for $10 in their special -- I tried the Key Lime Pie which tasted off, but then followed the drink up with their Almond Joy which was basically a disguised White Russian. Pretty good way to wash out the salt in our mouths!",

The employees seemed genuinely happy that we chose their restaurant. Our server was Milkh. She's professional, personable, attractive & attentive. She went out of her way to ensure we could enjoy our wine & meal & get to the show on time. Milkh is an employee who is a great asset to Ocean One. But all the severs seemed energetic & enthusiastic. Milkh just stood out & we were so happy to have her attending to us. We look forward to going back the next time we're in LasVegas.

When in Vegas, you have an abundance of outstanding culinary choices and we settled on Ocean One after a long day of shopping and we were just passing by and thought let's just grab something here. Shoulda kept walkin.  Our server was kinda funny, though. He looked like a kid and was probably a foreign exchange student or something. Instead of waiting on us, he watched World Series of Poker on the TV.   Their 2-for-1 drink special is like any other drink special scam on the strip. Small glass and almost no alcohol. I got my 2nd one to go and it came in a kids cup.  My wife ordered a pizza. The pizzas look impressive. Looks can be deceiving. Had the basil and artichoke....and cheese. Lotsa cheese. The pizza was like a heap of cheese, shreds of old basil, and canned artichoke hearts on one huge cracker separated by the thinnest layer of ricotta cheese. Bleh.  While writing this review, I forgot what I ordered. I think it was a chicken greek salad. The chicken was meager and the flavor was greek to me.  Pass.",

Not to mention that when we were sat; it took our server at LEAST 15 minutes to come and greet us. When he finally came, he could sense our disappointment and took our orders right away...You would think he would try to make things better but he didn't. We ordered 2 mimosas which took an additional 15 minutes. Ridiculous. Our food finally came out after which seemed like an eternity. When we received our cold toast; my friend had asked if we ALL could get new toast....He rolled his eyes and said yes..and then sent someone over who gave us ONE slice of toast. ?!!? Everything was terrible. We ended up being there an hour and a half!!!!!   It seemed as if they were understaffed. On a Holiday?? Don't know how that's possible..Whatever the case, I will NEVER be back.",

Daughter wanted a cocktail so she ordered a long island ice tea and two additional drinks, the 3rd one was made to go. The service is okay but not so much on the quality of the food. My pasta was cold, hubby\"s burger looked dry, daughter's fiances' chicken tacos had a piece of chicken that was raw. The only good item appeared to be good was the salmon.

    "text": "Been here multiple times before. The most important memory: first time I ever had creme brulee.  This restaurant is located in the Planet Hollywood Mile of Shops or formerly Aladdin hotel. It's strategically situated in the middle of that long streak of overpriced shops. All that walking gets my buddies and I hungry. What do we do? Eat at One Ocean.  The restaurant actually doesn't have many walls. Instead, large window spaces make the restaurant feel more open and spacious. A nice touch.  Environment: the open feeling of the restaurant is very welcoming. The place never really feels crowded although because of it's location and the setup, it's always loud. If that doesn't bother you, then have a seat and take a look at the menu. The decor fits the personality of the restaurant which is trying to pull off a casual but sophisticated look.  Waiters/waitresses: Our waitress did not go above and beyond the call of duty. She only came to our table to take our order, drop off food, drop off the bill, and pick up the bill. This was probably the worst part of this particular dining experience. Otherwise, there is nothing that really stands out about this employee.  Food: had the half pound sirloin steak burger. The patty was cooked medium well (no pink) and was covered with melted provolone cheese. In addition, it was topped with the normal staple of lettuce, tomato, and raw red onion slices. All together, this was pretty tasty. It had the distinct flavor of a home made hamburger prepared with fresh beef. The restaurant was a little stingy with the steak fries. It didn't look as if they were seasons but a hint of garlic was evident.  Drinks: only water. Sorry.  Recommendation: EAT!",

Good portion and the veggies are shaved and under the filet absorbing all the juices. My husband had the salmon with a juicy white rice and veggies. This place is affordable and a must place to go.

Portions are great considering it's only 4.99 for lunch, I get full off of every dish I've had so far. The 3:$10 drinks are amazing as well, I got the Long Island and each one was vStrong. This place is great and will continuously return",

Unfortunately the taste is similar.  however during dinner the food is much better but the service & $3 drinks are horrible. Not sure how to rate this as I didn't get two great things: food & service hand in hand. I will definitely be back during lunch, hopefully the food will be more flavorful then. *fingers crossed. Oh yeah..... don't buy the dinner Groupon at all. Try lunch for less !",

The whole entire lunch menu includes appetizers, entrees like steak and salmon for only 5 dollars and desserts. lunch is from noon to 5p.m. Normally when food is this cheap it taste cheap, but this is not the case. The food is great and full of flavor. Where can you go in America and get two entrees for 10. Even the servers cant explain how the owner is able to lower prices. Dinner can range $10 for most entrees. If you want filet mignon it's affordable at $22. I suggest the salmon salad, lemon pepper salmon, marinated skirt steak, steak quesadilla,chicken lollipops, spinach artichoke dip, chicken Caesar salad, peanut butter chocolate cheesecake and apple pie with cinnamon ice cream.  The strawberry and pina colda are only $3. You can get three glasses of wine for $10 and 3 shots for $10. You will thank me later.",

We got the ribeye and it tastes amazingly good.... service wasn't that great, the greeter didn't say anything when we went it so I had to ask her if we can get a table and she looked at me, grabbed the menus and started walking to the table so we didn't move then she then stopped and looked at us like we're idiots so we got the hint.... then we sit at the table we ordered the food right away since the server didn't ask for drink to begin with or anything. We ordered the food and he takes off, he kept cutting me while talking and there was no eye contact what so ever.... server then left and didn't come back until the food was ready... server put the food on the table and walked away, we didn't even have silverware on the table.... he then passed the table so we asked if we can get silverware, at the same time we wanted to order a salad and so it goes: \"can I get a Greek chicken salad please?\"  He goes : \"A salad?\"  Me:\"yes\"  He repeated it three times like who gets a salad at a restaurant! Then he says \"okay this is the last thing cause the kitchen is closing\"....   At the end of the day the food is great but the service is terrible.. my rating is for the food not the service... Food is 4 star service is 1 star if I have to break it down",

We finally got seated outside on the \"patio\" (actually inside the mall area) and the race was on.  Our waitress came over rather quickly, took our drink orders and was gone again. We let her know one of our party needed to eat and run, and amazingly she was back within a few minutes with our drinks. We ordered, she brought out our friends food first so he could go, and then brought out all the other meals.  I ordered a ribeye steak at $24.99, and surprisingly it was flavorful, and tender, cooked perfectly medium rare. The food was pretty good per everyone at the table.   So, good value, good food, and great service. I wish I could remember our servers name because she deserves a huge shoutout.",

The interior was really nice with a circular bar in the middle and plenty of seating throughout the restaurant. We were seated promptly along one side near large windows with a view of the busy shopping center.   There is an awesome lunch special here - Each lunch item is only $4.99! There are many options for lunch: Appetizers, tacos and burritos, salads, sandwiches and wraps and entrees, such as seafood and pasta.   I went for the orecchiette pasta with chicken and my mom ordered the salmon with mashed potatoes and vegetables- julienned zucchini and carrots. The pasta was delicious! Cooked perfectly al dente, with fresh steamed tasty artichokes, tomatoes & spinach, chock full of delightfully seasoned grilled chicken and plenty of melted parmesan cheese... All in a wonderful white garlic lemon sauce that permeated the dish. Somehow, each bite had just the right amount of sauce. I tried some of my mom's salmon which was pretty good. The mashed potato was fluffy and yummy. The portions for both meals were very generous.   Our server, Frankie was wonderful - genuinely friendly and pleasant. She provided us with everything we needed and took the time to talk with us a bit as well.   I would definitely consider coming back. They also offer $5.99 breakfast, $9.99 dinner and 3 for 1 cocktail specials... Hard to beat those prices!",

I proceeded to make an online reservation which was quick and easy but who needs quick and easy if it's not going to work? I showed up even after going through that whole pointless ordeal. Then this very beautiful waitress with dark hair and big brown eyes turned our whole night around she was kind and even cracked a few jokes with us, perfect customer service!!! She provided us with great details about the menu and this girl knew her drinks, can this girl get a raise?!?  Ask for Robby if you want to have a fun enjoyable meal.  Ps: Fix your phones and reservations system please",

We had the following: Jumbo Lump Crab Cake Appetizer Marinated New York strip steak Half Pound Sirloin burger with side of rice for the Mrs. Margherita pizza for Ian. 3 for $10 cocktails. Moscow Mule, Long Island & Almond Joy.   Pros: Deal on the 3 for 1 cocktails (+1) Sirloin Burger was a deal! (+1) Loved the Crab cake.  Almond Joy was delicious. It was like eating a dessert :)  Friendly staff. Marie our waitress was paying attention to all her tables. Abundant seating.   Cons: $5.00 for a Cappuccino! (-1)  You should definitely try their Half Pound Sirloin Burger as well as other options that are advertised for $5.99. It does not get any better than the deals they have in Vegas.",

They are totally trying to get you drunk and have you gamble haha! But there is another list of drinks that are $3  and kinda strong. They are really sweet especially the watermelon one.

We also ordered the Cajun Rock Shrimp Egg Rolls with Caesar side salads. Our appetizer plates were thrown on table, but maybe they slipped? The egg roll appetizers were good but things went south after that. The side salads had NO taste and got served on warm plates. The bun on my husband's burger was thinner than sliced bread, the meat was dry and he was only able to stomach a couple of bites. I LOVE Cajun pasta and this was THE worst pasta I've ever had, I took a few bites and left the rest alone. For a bar and grill restaurant I should've known better than to order a pasta dish. That being said, the burger at a bar and grill should've been the best thing on the menu. There was lipstick on my husband's glass that we didn't see it until after the fact!!!! We normally go to a restaurant a couple of times before we write them off, but a lessoned was learned the very first time for this place. We should've left when people turned to look as the appetizer plates hit the table. BTW go here if you want the waitress to watch over your shoulder as you fill in the tip!",

We ordered a couple appetizers during lunch time so they were only $4.99. Cant complain there! We got the spinach & artichoke dip and the wings which were not amazing, but not bad. The wings were crispy and on a stick which made them easy to eat without making a mess. The chips and the spinach and artichoke dip wasn't the best but better than like Applebee's. Service was very friendly! I will come back here!",

Beautiful decor and fantastic service are a given.  What surprised me were the amazingly low prices and the quality of the food was far above what I was expecting.  One morning I decided to splurge and get the steak and eggs.  Typically this would be a low expectation meal so I got the A1 steak sauce ready.  The steak was cooked perfectly and was seasoned just right.  No steak sauce required here, it was fantastic.  In fact - the person sitting next to me asking me if it was as good as it looked (it was!).    Drinks are 3 for $10 and hey use top shell liquor.  Don't waste your money on Fat Tuesday's - Ocean has $3 frozen drinks.  Unbelievable.    Another great find in Vegas.  I'll definitely be back!!",

    "text": "At this point, I have eaten from here way too many times to count! First of all, if you like a deal come here! RUN don't walk! lol I recommend the pastas or any of the $3.99-$5 deals. Where else can you get a perfectly delicious and simple steak lunch or salmon salad for that price on the strip???? No place I have discovered yet! My absolute go to is their orecchiette pasta. It is on the $3.99 menu which btw is monday-friday 11am-11pm. AND you can order out! Just pick up at the front desk and they send you an alert when its ready. The pasta has artichoke hearts, tomatoes, grilled chicken and a bunch of other yummy stuff with a creamy sauce. The portion is enough for two people. I have eaten half for dinner and saved the other half for lunch the next day.  Another deal of they have are the $5 deals which has an option for everyone. Lastly, the 3 drinks for $10 deal. I know a few of my yelp friends that would tear this deal DOWN! Not only is there a nice selection to choose from(wine, beers, mixed bevs or make your own) you can take the third drink with you! Yes! you heard me correctly, the restaurant is nice enough to give you a sippy cup for your third drink!   We have ordered out from here and sat inside at a table or at the bar. Great atmosphere, lots of tvs to watch games and friendly staff all around. I didn't give 5 stars because I have had their quesadilla which was was meh and so were the fish tacos. Other than those items everything else has been great. I highly recommend coming here if you're on a budget and need food/drink.",

When I told her I couldn't eat here because of all the seafood and the fact that I was deathly allergic, they let me bring my own food in so that I could still eat with my friends.  The specials here are almost too good to be True. Their entire food menu is only $5. This includes steak, burgers, seafood, you name it. All 3 of my friends ordered the burger and it even came with their choice of a side.  And the drinks are incredibly cheap. You can get any 3 drinks for $10 (they don't allow you to share with other people though so you have to drink all 3 yourself). But still, this was such a good deal considering you could order cocktails, wine, and champagne and mix and match. They also let you take your drinks to go in case you can't finish them all.  Seriously this place is a best kept Vegas secret since none of us had heard of it before, but I will definitely be sure to check it out next time I come back.",

Unfortunately, when you have a server who does not want to be there, and you get them, it puts a damper on the whole meal. We have a table of 7 and for most servers that means a high check so good tip, but I'm not giving money away. When a server tells me that he can't provide good service and have a decent attitude because he has too many tables then it's a wrap. Unfortunately, the manager was no help either. I asked for a different server but he said that they're all busy and that it would be the same. I understand being busy, we all get busy at work, but I don't understand the sour attitude. That I won't deal with. Beware when you come here, you'll get food eventually, but getting it with a smile or any pleasantries, may be a hassle.",

There is quite a selection from quesadilla, tuna tartare, grilled chicken tacos, buffalo chicken wrap, grilled chicken salad and a lot more. Just bear in mind that it is only $4.99 so the portions aren't big.  The restaurant itself is modern looking with lots of tables for couples and groups. The service is friendly. The menu has an extensive list and the price point is great. They have a variety of beer, cocktails and wine and very cheap. You can get three for one wine or cocktails for $10, frozen drinks and beer for $3.  The drinks are not the crappy kind too!!  It is definitely worth coming here just for drinks !  I came here for dinner the next day and it was pretty good. The chicken Marsala was about $17. The chicken was good, but they could have done a bit better with the risotto. However, the double pork chop with mash potatoes and natural Demi-glace reduction was yummy and about $23. The portions aren't huge but it is a decent size.",

AMAZING! We were seated right away, we order lollipop wings for starters and chicken penne and smoked salmon for entree... it was yummy!

It sounds too good to be True but it's not. I couldn't even finish my 2nd glass of wine, so our server brought me a to go cup for my 3rd glass & the remainder of my 2nd. I'm also not sure who else would be able to take down a shot of whiskey and 2 old fashioneds in one meal (also just $10!) but if you can, I will happily give you a standing ovation and watch you stumble out.   On a holiday weekend Friday, we put our name on the list & were seated in about a minute. I'm sure as word gets out about this place, that may change. Our server was patient and hustled the entire time we were dining. We selected the calamari appetizer. It was on our table in a flash, lightly breaded, flash fried, and served over a mild tomato based sauce. I went for the chicken Cesar salad, and opted for dressing on the side. It was a decent sized portion, the lettuce was fresh and the chicken was tenderly grilled. The Mr. went for the buffalo wrap and selected fries for the side. Yea, you read that right - for $4.99 you can get a buffalo wrap and your choice of fries, Cole slaw or rice & beans. The fries were fresh & crunchy. The wrap had real blue cheese in it.    I still can't believe we had an amazing meal, with 6 drinks, and fantastic people watching (you are in the miracle Mile shop corridor) for under $40.",

I've had the steak w/ mash potato and veggies, salmon, tuna tartare, chicken wings, mahi tacos w/ chips, and alcoholic beverage. You honestly can't beat that for $5. The alcoholic beverages are 3/10$ or else the frozen alcoholic drinks are $3 each (I specifically love the banana daiquiri mixed with mango ) they are very efficient with the seating I never had to wait more than 10 minutes. The service was also very good, we got our food quickly. I would say the presentation isn't beautiful but the food is dirt cheap so very much expected. Definitely recommend this place! I cant believe the quality of food & price!",

Met several people while getting my daily miles in on the strip. Thankfully one was able to highly recommend this restaurant when I inquired about places to eat. He mentioned daily specials, great taste and large portions. All were accurate and pleasing to the pallette!   My daughter had the ceasar salad and tacos. I had the steak with julienned vegetables and potatoes. My steak was tender and full of flavor. Veggies were not overcooked and tasted great too. I sampled the tacos and found them to be tasty. Drink prices were reasonable and had 2-4-1 specials.   The wait staff was personable and very attentive. I highly recommend this place for the lunch special of $4.99 per plate with many options. Dinner prices were reasonable, but why not dine a bit earlier and sample more? I believe lunch menu was served until @4 or 5 pm.",

It is located in the Miracle Mile shops. This place was delish! I got the smoked salmon with bagel. Now, we are from New York and this dish is a New York staple so I set my expectations low since New York bagels are like nothing else. I was pleasantly surprised. The platter consisted of a bagel which was great, fresh salmon, fresh fruit salad and toppings for the bagel. The coffee was great and the service was awesome. Our waitress was attentive and friendly. This place was also priced really well for Vegas. Much lower than expected. Highly recommend this place!",

I'm not sure why computer problems would delay our meal, but we decided we should go elsewhere. The next morning, we decided to give Ocean One another try. This time, they sat us right away. Then we waited and waited and no one came. After 10 minutes, we stopped a server who was passing by and asked him who our server was. he said he would check and have them come by. 5 minutes later, we still hadn't had a server come over. We got up and left. We went across the way to Oyster Bay. The cost of our steak and eggs with a $5 bloody Mary was less than it would have been at Oceans One. A;so, from where we sat, we could see a family that arrived at Oceans One at the same time we did. They just got their food as we were finishing our meal.

I asked them on three different occasions why I was obviously bumped, the hostess just ignored me and kept lead other later arriving customers to the tables. One of them, on the counter, then asked me if I have another person with me, which I replied no and that she spelled my name George wrong for Georgor. She was very rude and cold, and ignored me again right after that.  I asked the other host about that too, but she kept saying just wait. By this time I see my politeness was not going any where, I asked her if I can speak to their manager. She grabbed a passing by waiter and said he is the manager.  The waiter said to us that he was not the manager as she lied, and he was decent and said he'll go to find the manager for me. That host was rude and lied to belittle me, and wanted to get rid of me.  I asked them for their names, and they refused and looked at me with the \"what the f...\" facial expressions. Later on I find out their names are; the counter host was Staffany, and the moving host was Ki---something.  I was a tourist, and I did not deserve to be treated like that so badly. They belittled me, humiliated me, and lied to me. All they had to do was telling me to take a hike, and I have no problems to eat at other fabulous restaurants in Vegas.   The manager did see me about this, and he was so nice and generous to seat me and provided me with a good lunch. He knew the problem I had.  I'm writing this complaint because the owners of the Ocean One Restaurant need to know their employees are treating certain customers very badly. No tourist deserve that bad feeling. How would the owners feel if they go to a restaurant and get treated badly like me?

Their eggroll appetizer was really bomb though. They made the rest of our experience here very nice with our sweet server, Evelyn. She checked up on us a lot, especially when one of my friends was getting the 3 for $10 drinks (so worth it). Also this restaurant was relatively cheap on the strip. I would definitely come back for the drinks and appetizers.",

The bar manger who is useless; she had the worst customer service, she didn't have one contact number or any way to help, instead giving us attitude and not one hope for a solution. She also said this has only happened to us. As we walked to another venue - we met up with people who just went through the same thing. A few hours in the afternoon- we get messages that BOTH OF IUR CARDS WERE CHARGED! We check out accounts and sure enough our money is gone.   We have been calling and without any response.

    "text": "$4.99 isn't bad for lunch in Vegas, is it?  I mean, if you're not buffet bingeing, a $4.99 burger, let's say, made quickly and easily and served within the Miracle Mile Mall can't be that bad.  Can it?  Because if you'd just lower your expectations a bit and understand that for a measly $4.99 you should in no way get your hopes up, you'd be golden, stopping in for a bite during Ocean One's $4.99 lunch special.  And that must have been the problem: we expected a little too much from Ocean One.  Although the pictures we took speak for themselves--depicting a rather sad looking burger and a very dry chicken--the service wouldn't prove to be any better.  Ours, Rufat, saw our table only three times: once to take our order, a second time (when after I'd called him over) to return with my corrected order, and a third time to drop off the bill.  Truthfully, we'd wished we had just purchased a less than mediocre lunch elsewhere.  After all, Vegas has more than enough to offer.  Besides, a $2.99 soda, when added to the bill, alters that \"deal\" you had imagined receiving.  Your meal now: $8.00.  That's quite slippery of you, Ocean One.  Nice work!  We won't be seeing you again.",

And the portion size was very good.  I even split my burger in half, and I shared the fries.  Nice staff, and felt welcomed.

    "text": "Stopped by here for a quick lunch, since they have the lunch special pricing listed out front.  Bonus?  If you sit near the windows or in their \"outside\" eating area, you can see the indoor rainstorm.  Visited on a Saturday, it wasn't terribly crowded, but they seemed understaffed.  The hostess explained that it would take a minute because our server had a pretty full section.  Didn't mind that.  She warned us upfront.  However, even as the place started to empty out, the service didn't improve.  I had to go get my own drink refilled at the bar because we didn't see her from the time food was delivered until we had to flag her down for a check.  We were there over an hour just to eat a little wrap.  The price is right, but the service is just okay.  The restaurant is well decorated, but the bathrooms were not only in an awful condition, but they could definitely use some updating.  You'd expect a bit more given the other restaurants included within the shops, but I guess you get what you pay for.  The food was okay.  Nothing spectacular, but again, it's cheap (and better than fast food), so you get what you get!",

We enjoyed salads and pasta dishes, not gourmet dining but for $5 exceeded expectations!  And the drinks-three for $10!  Approximately the size of those at casino, but you can mix and match your three, cocktail before your meal, wine with it and sweet something for dessert.  The drinks did not seem watered down or heavy on mixer either. Servers were prompt and professional.  Other patrons seemed to be enjoying themselves as well. We will be back on our next Las Vegas adventure, probably more than onxe",

    "text": "This is not my normal review because this was not a normal experience and I wish I could give a zero star.   I visited this location while staying in Vegas this week for work meetings. Since we stayed at Planet Hollywood this was in the mall connected and easy for Lunch.  They were not very busy and the service was less than average. There was little follow up with us on the meal progress and little follow up after the meal arrived. Once the meal arrived we had limited service. Plus I have never been to a restaurant that refused to give customers a paper receipt. They only have emailed receipts???? They clearly do not want business from those traveling for business and need receipts for expenses. We can't assume everyone has email or likes email. Plus not all companies will allow an email receipt for expenses.  We had a group of five ordering. One of my group ordered the seared tuna ahi for his meal. He had only eaten some fruit for breakfast prior to lunch and felt fine. In just a couple hours he became violently ill with food poisoning. He was throwing up and major stomach pain's. He even had to have the hotel come clean his bathroom as the violent and rapid throw up prevented him from making it to the bathroom. I have experience with food safety and I have no doubt it was the tuna from the restaurant not handled properly. However, it's  waste of time to tell them because they will simply say you can't prove it was them, you can't prove it wasn't something else he ate even the day before, you can't prove blah blah blah and they will deny all responsibility. My co-worker spent the rest of the entire afternoon and evening in his room and bed sick.   Two of the others in group became sick to their stomachs but to the extreme the one did. They felt nausea and stomach cramps the rest of the afternoon themselves.   Since I can not scientifically prove my co-worker received food poisoning from this location; even though my circumstantial evidence indicates he did, I will say eat here at your own risk.",

We were seated immediately and service was quick. Our waitress was awesome and I wish I could remember her name but she was blonde with glasses and the friendliest person we had met all weekend. We all ordered the $3 pina coladas and strawberry daiquiris which were bomb. The lunch menu had a great selection especially for the price and we were all able to order something different. We were expecting smaller portions with the $4.99 price but we all received a lot of food. We ordered 2 spinach and artichoke dip appetizers because it was that good and the salsa that came along with it was my favorite part of the whole lunch aside from the daiquiri. So for fast food prices we were able to nurse our hangovers with a big lunch with drinks included in a nice atmosphere and great service.",

When ordering, Waitress would not let my husband and daughter share a hamburgar/Fry combo  Said the price was already reduced so no sharing, no offer of letting regular price be charged so they could share.  So they ordered nothing.  I order the same combo. and only thing I asked was no onions and she told me If she put too many things down the cooks would mess it up so I could pick the onions off.  I could not believe she said that lol I only asked for No onions.  Wow,  alot of confidence in the cooks. ( We really should of walked out at that point but we had already ordered and received our drinks) Anyway I said ok.  However I could taste onion even tho I picked it off, ruined the burgar according to my taste buds.   Outside advertisement it offers a choice for side item and I was never offered anything.  I just asked about fries and she said yes.  Took about an  hour to get our food. They was confused as to what food went where.   My daughter ordered skirt steak and shrimp and even tho it was pink it was tough, as if it was well done.  Quanity nor Quality Was not worth $19 for that menu item.  Salmon Sandwich that my daughters boyfriend ordered and My son childs menu chicken strip was both good.    Now back to the waitress.  Several times when my husband and I was talking she'd come over and interrupt, stood around like she was trying to over hear.  It was weird.   The frozen alcoholic drinks comes out in what looks like a childs glass rather than whats shown in the advertisement.   $76 for one hamburgar combo, shirt steak and shrimp dinner, salman sandwich, childs chicken tenders, two sodas (one was a child size but was charge the adult price) and two $3 frozen alcohol drink and one glass of beer.  Over all, the food, time it took, and most of all the service was NOT worthy of what we paid.   I personally don't recommend this place and we will never eat here again.  The waitress wasn't worth a fast food job let alone a job at a restaurant of this class.  I still can't believe she said for me to pick off the onions.  I said Huh the first time cause I Truely thought I misunderstood her.  She repeated the same thing.  LoL  I actually did laugh out loud and SMH.  Beyond bad customer service.  and that's the main reason for lack of stars.  She was about an early 40's lady with black hair in a pony tail.  I shoulda got her name but that was my mistake.  I was still smh about the onion/cooks thing.  I think from now on when ordering at a place we don't kno we will wait to order our drinks with our meal; so if something this bad occurs we can walk out.  Our visit was Saturday 4/09/2016 in the evening.",

We'd noticed the restaurant earlier in the day, so we decided to give it a try. We ate there around 6 on a Saturday night. Nice ambience, pretty restaurant and short wait to get in. We had 5 adults and two small children in our party (which is always scary as a parent bringing kids to a nicer place!), but when I saw that there were a few kid's items on the menu, I decided they'd hopefully be kid-friendly. Our server Tracy was so friendly and welcoming! She didn't rush us in making our menu selections and answered all of our questions with lots of knowledge of the dishes. I always appreciate it when a server has actually eaten the restaurant's food and can share their favorite items and tell you about the menu. She told us about how the meats and fish are cut in house and all the sauces are also house-made, which impressed me. We enjoyed a calamari appetizer and everyone was very pleased with their meals, and highlights included the surf and turf and pork chop. Everything was cooked as requested and had good flavor. My father, who was in town earlier in the week for a business conference, had eaten at many high-end restaurants during his stay and on previous Vegas trips. But he said this meal (the pork chop) was his favorite of the week-tender and melt in your mouth pork in a nice atmosphere, but one that's not too pushy or stuffy.",

Also had the grilled salmon, juicy salmon with mashed potatoes that are buttery and both melt in your mouth and are accompanied with veggies. My husband had the chicken sandwich with fries. Evelyn was our server and was sweet, prompt, attentive, had great recommendations and never let our drinks get empty. Very impressed. Definitely will be back!",

Regardless of the time of day, we noticed a steady stream of customers reading the menu that is on display, being seated or leaving the restaurant satisfied.  We were seated after a minute. For lunch we had 1) shredded beef tacos and 2) club sandwich.  However the excellent food is only half of the reason to visit multiple times: the 3-for-$10 special is excellent. Mix and match and take one for the road....it is encouraged. We went back the same day before a show. I had an iron steak and Mrs. had shrimp cocktail. Excellent..both. More drinks courtesy of the deal.  We will recommend to anyone walking the Strip.  Great service both visits.",

    "text": "This restaurant was located in between the planet Hollywood casino and our hotel at Elara. It sits near Panda Express and is a convenient location.   What got us in was the 5 dollar lunch special and I must say, it is the best bang for your buck. I'm not expecting anything gourmet, and compared to what you can normally get at a fast food restaurant, this was definitely the best choice. I went twice in two days!   The first time I went I got the flank steak: steak for lunch? Can't say much more. It came with a side of mash potato and vegetables with a steak sauce under the vegetables. It tasted great the first time, but the second time I could tell it wasn't as good. But for the price of steak and the portion, really can't beat that deal.   The pasta was absolutely amazing and portion was huge. Make sure to get the one with the Alfredo sauce, it's not the pasta penne. Get the other one. Amazingly delicious.   The second time I came I got 3 things: spaghetti, steak, and the lollipop wings. Spaghetti was what I was craving and it did the job, with an additional side of crushed red pepper flakes. Steak was another craving so I had to have it. And the lollipop wings was a great portion for appetizer and tasted good.   I tried a little of the spinach artichoke dip, and I felt like it was fairly bland. Was not eating anymore after I tried a second bite of it.   If u want filling dish that will hit the spot, go for the pasta (not with tomato sauce). If u want enjoyment, steak for sure!",

Very casual chill ambience, with country music in the background   Food: chicken Marsala $17.99 and chicken wings $8.99. I thought the chicken Marsala was a bit oily. The spinach was drenched in oil, made it a bit difficult to eat. The wings however were good.   Drinks: I tried to have the strawberry daiquiri however, it's unavailable at the moment. My next choice was a cappuccino, apparently that machine is not working either. So I settled for some good ol' lemon and water.   Service: the girls greeting at the door are adorable, very nice and chatty, and very good at enticing you to sit down and check out their food.   There's TVs available Incase you want to watch some games.",

The food was really good, the service was awesome, and to top it off they had 3 drinks for only $10. Yes each drink is only $3.33 which by itself is unheard of in Vegas but it has the better tier alcohol included (I'm a Tito's or Grey Goose drinker) and it was included. $3 Blue Moon beers, shall I go on?!?

Lunch menu is $4.99 for all items and dinner starts at $9.99 with the most expensive item around $28 which is their surf and turf (filet mignon and lobster tail served with mashed potatoes and brocollini). Try the Prime rib steak for dinner at $24.99!Their cocktails and some wine are 3 for $10 all day everyday!  Food is good and price is cheap, we've been here multiple times for lunch and just tried dinner! Best place to get some great food at a decent price.",

I generally get a screwdriver to go with my scrambled eggs, bacon and hash browns and I can only give a 4 star review because I sit at the bar. The bartender was  fast and friendly and the busboys a quick cleaning up your dirty dishes in removing glassware from the bar. So if you like your alcohol and food pretty reasonably price, even for Vegas standards then you Definitely want to check out this little restaurant hidden in the miracle mile shops.",

Our server Angel did a great job serving us.  My husband had the Simple Salmon with asparagus and rice and said the salmon was done perfectly.  I had the Southwest grilled half chicken with a mixture of black beans and rice and a a side of well seasoned corn.  Delicious!  The bill was $60 with each of us having 3 drinks each.  He had Dewar's and I had cosmopolitans.  What a deal, and good to boot!  Went back after the show for 3 more and the bartender, Cody, was a joy!  We will definitely be back!  (Ignore the whiners.

At $25, it was half the price and twice the quality of the same steak we had at a strip hotel steakhouse.  The calamari appetizer was also tasty.  House white zin was 3 generously poured glasses for the price of one.  Even without a Groupon, this place is a gem, even more so for its location.  We are returning for sure!",

For starters, we had the calamari appetizer and their 2 for 1 drink special.  I had the Hawaiian cosmo and hubby had a cocktail and beer.  For dinner I had the island salmon salad of mixed greens, pistachios and red onions tossed with a mango vinaigrette.  I was surprised that it was a large portion of salmon which was warm and cooked well. The salad was fresh, and I liked the pistachios - it was a nice alternative to a green salad with walnuts.  My hubby had the grilled chicken club with bacon, swiss and honey dijon mayo and mash potatoes.  Overall we enjoyed our meal, the prices were reasonable, and the service was great.",

Our server did not introduce herself and instead of saying hello the first thing she asked was what we wanted to drink.  Not if we had questions or a simple hello and welcome.  I couldn't believe but our server had a shirt that said \"pink\" or \"juicy\" on the back of it, how un-professional was that?!! Did not feel like a restaurant at that point.  We did not get a managers visit throughout our entire stay and we could see him chatting with staff.  I asked my burger Med Rare and it came med well to well.  Not to mention it tasted like it was frozen.  I had asked for rice as a side and got fries.  The place looks like  your eating in a lobby as well very weird feel.  There is no music at all.  Our server dropped our check assuming we wanted it and never asked how it tasted until we had told her that it tasted like frozen meat.  My girlfriend had the marg. pizza and it was bland with no flavor.  Also, they cover up the tables with a piece of paper as if your supposed to draw on it like maccaroni grille.  If you are trying to save on linen costs don't put linen on your tables because then you make it seem like you want your guest to eat at a kids table with paper on it.  I feel sorry for a place that could have so much potential.  I hope in a month or so as I maybe visit it again management reads this and changes.",

The place looks really nice so i give it one star for that but everything else about this place sucked. The service was horrible. When our appetizer came out our server didn't bring us any plates and he didn't come back to check up on us until he came back with our entrees. The food wasn't that great either.",

    "text": "This place is pretty classy for being inside the Miracle Mile Shops at Planet Hollywood, where I was staying for the weekend. The breakfast specials weren't too bad... $5.99 for pancakes, sausage, part of a strawberry, and a slice of orange... not many places can beat that on the Strip. I thought breakfast was pretty decent for the price and I especially like their coffee. The service was okay and the waiter was really smiley. Wish I knew they had free internet when I ate there... so you could bring in your laptop or smartphone and surf the net while you eat. :)",

    "text": "My coworkers used to get lunch here a lot.  They have some decent lunch specials for $5.99.  Unfortunately, the service has been so bad lately that we all stopped going. I stopped in today to pick up a cup of coffee with my coworker.  We only came here because it was the closest place we could get it, and we needed it fast. I tried to order from the girl at the front first.  She cut me off, and ran off saying she'd be back.  5 minutes later another girl came up.  We ordered from her, and she went off somewhere.  I watched her walk in, and out of the kitchen a couple of times, check on 5 tables, and disappear into the back room.  Another server walked by, but ignored us when we tried to talk to her.  Finally, the other girl came back, and told us that we should go order our coffee at the bar.  So...how long does it take 4-5 servers to pour 2 cups of black coffee?  About half an hour, if you're ordering at Ocean One.",
