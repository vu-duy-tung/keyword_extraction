    "text": "The bartenders here are highly skilled performers that do much more than just pour your drink. At this bar outside of Harrah's, you find the best \"flair\" bartenders in Las Vegas. The last thing you wanna order here is a draft beer.  Drinks are pricy but come out pretty consistently which may seem surprising with how many flips and fancy moves the bartenders here can do. Great music and live entertainment at this outdoor bar. They had a couple of rock bands tearing it up. This is definitely where the party gets started!   The food is pretty decent. The only downside is the uncontrollable heat during the summer months so definitely go at night and be sure to secure yourself a seat at the bar to enjoy the flair show!",

    "text": "I almost skipped this bar! I'm so glad I didn't! It's a blast!  Located just outside of Harrah's hotel, Carnaval Court Bar & Grill, at first glance looks like a place where a bunch of college frat boy D-bags and their girlfriends would congregate. And just as I suspected, there were plenty of them. But there was also a good amount of normal people, cougars and a few perverted old men gawking at the young scantly glad girls. I love a diverse crowd.   I had been told this is a great place to hang out, especially if you're into live bands that play loud rock music. We skipped this place the first couple of nights we were in Vegas but on our last night we decided to give it a try. I'm glad we did.   The house band, Mr. and Mrs. Smith, are awesome. The band features both a male and female lead singer. They were belting out tons of classic and newer rock tunes, all while a big crowd danced and cheered and sang along with them. Now I'm not gonna lie, they're not the best singers around but they were great at entertaining the crowd. They really know how to get people out of their seats. When the band is not playing they have a DJ spinning all types of music.   I loved that this place has a huge bar area with tons of stools, a bunch of tables and chairs around the edge of the venue and even some VIP booths in case you want bottle service. There's also a few blackjack tables in case you feel like losing your money while you party.   The drinks here are strong and reasonably priced. The servers and bartenders are friendly and really hustle to make sure everyone gets their drinks as quickly as possible.  I'd definitely party at the Carnaval Court Bar again.",

The bartenders genuinely seem to be having fun and really know how to put on a good show. They can poor about 10 shots (who knows, maybe even more!) at once, and have mastered tons of flips and tricks. We lucked out to find a guy who had gotten arrested the night before, but was free and ready to celebrate, so he paid for all of our drinks! hahaha... even without that, this was one of our favorite stops and we keep talking about how much we want to go back!! Can't wait.",

The bartenders were crazy and fun (and pretty impressive with the bottle juggling), an 80s hair metal cover band was playing, and the place overall had a really fun/non-snooty vibe. Plus, I like any place that doles out free (well, technically they require a tip) shots poured in one's mouth, and any place that gets my mom to do one of said shots!  We came back again in the evening, when the place was much more crowded and a DJ was playing. I preferred the afternoon atmosphere more than the late-night one, but it was still a great time. I'm giving it four stars instead of five because the drinks were a bit overpriced (though I guess that's to be expected on the Strip), and because the vibe definitely changes from day to evening.   I highly recommend making a stop here next time you're in Vegas!",

    "text": "This has got to be my favorite watering holes in Vegas! It's where you come when it's not quite hot enough to lay by your pool (October through March) or in the early evening when you are sick to death of laying by your pool.  Here, a band plays live music and the bartenders juggle liquor bottles like they were auditioning for \"Cocktail 2\". I love being able to sip on drinks in the sunshine, while a cover band plays live hits ranging from the 70's to present .  The guys we often travel with love to be able to gamble and get away from us yapping women. Here, they can do that, because they have outdoor blackjack tables.  I see a lot of people sit in the chairs, facing the band, or dancing to the lovely music near the stage. Me? I just want to sit and take it all in, with a big, tall, fruity cocktail in my hand.  As for the location, it's right outside of the Harrah's hotel. You have to use the casino restrooms, which is quite a trek, but well worth it considering there's no cover charge midday and the drinks cost a lot less than in the clubs or around the nicer hotel pools.  To me, the bar itself looks like a Merry-go-round. That has nothing to do with nothing, but it really helps in describing it to friends when referring them to check it out.  I don't go to Vegas as often as I used to, but this is one spot I never miss, when I do.",

I've been here a couple of times and on my first couple visits it left me disappointed.  Watching the bartenders gets old after a few minutes.  This reminds me of Vegas's version of a dive bar. I'm a sucker for dive bars but this is a very crowded overrated dive bar.    My last visit was different, I had an absolute blast and based off of that experience alone, I would definitely go back.  They played great music that night and the shots of Patron were massive.   It was a great vibe with some crazy ass people.    The next morning I woke up with a burrito in my purse so I'm guessing night ended pretty well.",

I needed two water for a friend and myself, but out of courtesy, I did not want to order water alone (I believe in contributing to an establishment). I ordered a vodka/redbull and two waters. I asked him to close out immediately. $14 was charged to my card... for a shot of house vodka/ redbull. \"$14 seems too much for a vodka/redbull.\" I said. His rebuttal: \"You're in Vegas, what did you expect? I can't give your money back.\" I asked, \"Please return the money to to the card.\" He then said, \"You're too broke for Vegas, aren't you?, and preceded to close out the transaction on the computer ... Angry, I asked for the manager. The manager tossed the beverage and returned my money in cash.   In my experience as a restaurant manager, I have seen bartenders/servers take advantage of people who are \"out of sorts\" through several methods. Watch out for people like this on the strip.   The bartender's name was Adam.   Cheers.",

While we were waiting in line, there were a lot of people jumping out of line as soon as they saw the entrance fee.  I admit, we were one of them because who doesn't let locals get in for free?!  Any way, easiest way to get around that is get there early and get your band ahead of time.  Soooo....  The atmosphere is loud and fun.  They have go-go dancers, a DJ and a dancefloor, and your very talented flare-bartenders.  Drinks yes are pricey, but don't forget you are on the Las Vegas Strip, the bartenders however poor heavy, so you make out with that (think you are ordering a double) or you know what, order something strong.

As for most of us grown ups maybe not so much.  The bar tenders here are great and very entertaining like Jesters/jugglers. The bar itself reminds me of bars you encounter in Rosarito, Mexico especially with the type of crowd it attracts. A cool spot to hit up for sure but does not have a Vegas feel to it.",

    "text": "Stopped in here on a Tuesday night- had an awesome time! Supposedly home of the greatest flair bartenders in the world- don't know if I'd put them as the greatest in the world, but they are pretty impressive. Music typically rotates between a live band and a live DJ. The live band was pretty good, played a lot of rock, and the crowd was having a pretty good time. A lot of dancing, and a LOT of drunken idiots making fools of themselves. Pull up a seat at the bar, sit back, and watch the show. There is typically a cover later at night, so be prepared to wait for a bit in line and pay to get in. When I went on a Tuesday, it was fairly empty. Been by on a Friday night, and it was PACKED.  It was my birthday when the clock struck midnight, and the bartender was cool enough to hook me up with a free shot, which he poured directly out of the bottle and into my mouth- very cool. Another bartender was lighting the place up with her cool tricks and dancing. She made up some drink  that she invented, a strawberry daiquiri type drink, and she must've sold about 100 of those things. When she finished serving them to the customers, she took the leftovers in the blender and gave them to my girlfriend. For free. About 5 times. How sweet is that? It seemed about every 20 minutes or so, the \"flair\" bartending was put on display. Whistles start blowing and a bartender starts flipping the bottles, and throwing glasses, and generally drawing the attention of everyone there. Definitely an entertaining evening, and I enjoyed the place. At the end of the night, after a ton of drinks and shots, the bill was only 25 bucks. Can't beat it. Go in with a good attitude, let loose, and have some fun. As long as it's not super packed, you're going to have a great time. I will definitely stop in again sometime.",

No one gives a  *#$% what they do or who's watching, as long as they are having fun.  There are other good things about this place like the drinks are reasonable,  the flair tenders are entertaining and the bands or DJ play crowd favorites (sometimes based on what the crowd requests). For me however its the people!   They are just here to have fun, and so what if guys are so drunk they are dancing with their \"bro\", who cares, they won't remember tomorrow!  And so what if the 23 year old \"frat boy\" has so many shots of Patron that he's now hitting on some 50 year old house wife whose husband just went to the bathroom,who cares......he won't remember any of it tomorrow.

The funny is thing is that they really suck at singing, but for some reason they are great at entertaining. They really know how to keep the crowd going, the dance floor was always full of people.  I don't remember there being a cover charge a few years ago but now there is a $10 cover charge.  Try not to go there in the middle of summer like I did, it was so freakin hot, even the mist they had going didn't really help out.  This place is outside and has coverings, there are also a few gambling tables if you want to try your luck.",

Now I wasn't there for the full show, but I stopped at the cart to get me a 1/2 yard to saunter down the Strip.  The four stars are for the strength.  I ordered some kind of Vodka Rasberry Lemonade.  It was on the rocks, which I prefer--no brainfreeze from the slushy stuff.  The bartender poured a damn good amount of two different vodkas-one Smirnoff, one Absolut.  Not my top choices for vodka, but it wasn't well shit, so hey, I'll take it.  Woo hoo!!!  Party in my mouth!!",

    "text": "We recently returned from another three night stay in Vegas. We stayed at Harrah's this trip because of Carnaval Court. We spent all three nights here--Friday through Sunday--at the blackjack tables in the back. We had a BLAST!  I really cannot say enough good things about this place. It is laid back, fun and great entertainment. The waitress service is second to none. We had Glenda all three nights! She is fabulous. On Sunday night, it was chilly by Las Vegas standards. She was bringing us Bailey's and hot chocolate. She was attentive, anticipated what we needed before we needed it and had a great sense of humor!  The dealers are great! We had so much fun--they were mouthy, sarcastic and funny! They made it so much fun. This is probably not the environment for a real serious gambler, but if you want to have fun and drink while playing it is great. The pit bosses are the friendliest around. On Sunday, when only three people were playing we sat and talked with them.  I agree that the crowd is older (my group included). It is a nice alternative to the crowed club scene which I believe we are much too old for. The music is great for those of us who grew up in the 80s. I haven't found a more entertaining place in Vegas and doubt that I will!",

This bar is Harrah's Money Maker. It's usually packed and the bartenders are all flairdevils(Flair Bartending group) They have a band area....dj....sometimes 80s bands, cover bands....etc...Roomy dance area. Most of all folks, they pour heavy. OH YEA. With Flair bartenders you get a show. Don't expect to just drink and run. The crowd is friendly and drinks just flow. Try not to expect expensive drink prices. Because it averages 6 bucks versus the clubs and their 10 -11 dollar drinks. It's loud and just like going to spring break in Tijuana or Ensenada.  Check out Renee Garcia who's been there since they opened. Filipino dude usually works the front of the bar facing the stage. World Champion Christian Delpeche from Argentina flairs there, etc....If you think the movie Cocktail you know what flair is...WRONG AGAIN....",

One note though; the flair bar tending is cool the first time you see it then it gets old...really fast. I actually went to a couple of these flair bar tending contests (I do not know what possessed me to attend such an event) but it is the same twelve people who competed for the last ten years. I even heard one guy say that he has a mock bar at his garage and he practices all the time. They even have a club/group for flair bartenders. Are you serious?

Now that I am quite older, I have the rationality to know when I'm acting (a little) crazy.  After a long Sunday... yeah a Sunday night... I would like to the apologize to the following people at Carnaval Court:  1 - Sorry to the girl who got on the dance floor and 1 sec later lost her filled cup of booze to my flailing, electrified arm.  Luckily, she looked at me, stared, shrugged then went back to the bar.  2 - Super sorry to the 5 gals sitting at the round booth.  I am sorry I left my sweater there are forced you all to watch it and not spill anything on it as I repeated annoyingly that I would be extremely distraught if I lost the sweater.  3 - Apologies to the female whom I unkindly told that her boyfriend couldn't dress and that his vest look was 'so early 90s'.  I was even luckier that she did not slap me in the face (and I am pretty sure she dressed him).  4- All kinds of sorry to the security guard for putting up with a drunk and belligerent Asian with glasses.  This same Asian yelled over the music and danced spaztically around while happily ordering bartender's choice shots, then stood up, quickly gagging on them.    In short, this bar is AWESOME! They check IDs, but there is no cover.  You can also DANCE outside to a live band which is actually a decent, talented group of guys.  More importantly, the bartenders are not only knowledgeable of how to pour a #$%^ drink, but also do it with some flair and a smile. Props to the bartenders working here! Drinks are normal price for The Strip, but they aren't weak pours by any means. Lots of the people were locals who were loyal fans / regulars.  I think I made 10 new friends... and whether they wanted to talk to me or not- does not matter! I was on a mission to have a good night and succeeded.",

It's an outdoor bar with heat lamps to keep you warm and it was rather cold here in Vegas last night.  The band, Mr. and Mrs. Smith played Top 40 songs one after the other to keep the momentum going and the bar occasionally offered free shots.  Plenty of room for dancing.  They also have a DJ as well and he kept people dancing too.  On a Saturday night, the cover charge was $10 for men and $5 for women.  We were hoping for some oldies music like Michael Jackson and such but only got a few verses of ABC from the band mixed with other songs.  Good if you feel like dancing.",

The bartenders do amazing bar tricks that are sure to impress. They have so much open space where you don't feel crammed or pushed around. You can even do bottle service for a very reasonable price where you have your own section and table. They have hot girls dancing up above you and you can gamble there too. So much entertainment in one spot!  Always a fun crowd and great music to dance to. This place is great for groups as you will have no problem getting in.

They are always throwing around bottles and spinning around doing fancy things.   Drinks are affordable, entertainment is great, and I love the outside and open concept.

The band played and sang very well, but their schtick I could have done without. When you play well you don't need a hook. The location is cool, I like the tent-like feel of being outside but protected from the elements. We were there in the late afternoon and the sun was shining right into the bar seating area, which was a bit annoying, but what can you do about the sun when you're outside? The bartenders were practicing the \"Cocktail\"-esque bottle flipping when we were there with fake bottles. I'm sure at night their theatrics are very cool. The place is plenty big and it was a good blend of music, bar scene, dance club, and gambling spot to keep any kind of Vegas visitor occupied. Cool spot to go if your party can't agree on what to do at night.",

    "text": "My new favorite IT place in Vegas.  I saw this on Food Network that they had flair bartenders, so I HAD to check it out. I can't believe I always walked by it and never knew.  Sandwiched in between Harrah's and Imperial Palace, Carnival Court is a chill outdoor bar to go to, when you're tired of all that so-called Vegas glamour and glitz. No need to wear a dress, no need to stumble in heels, no need to wait in line, no stupid cover (although I'm a girl...I never pay cover anyways :P).  This place sure does draw in an interesting crowd, from the young college kids to the older folks. But I have to admit there were many down to earth people, including the bartenders. It was nice change of pace conversing with people instead of booty grinding.   But if you wanna dance, they got a dance floor too! So you can dance off all that alcohol. They had a DJ when I was there, but I hear they have live cover bands earlier in the day.  Prices here are comparable to the clubs...$10-12, but they are surprisingly strong. I got more messed up here from 3 drinks (Mai Tai, White Russian, Crown & Coke) than I did the previous night at Club Pure, which I had a Jaegerbomb and FOUR AMF's (total fail). And you get fancy flair! Good drinks and a show...bonus points in my book.  I have yet to try their food, although I'd prolly throw it all up anyways.  Everyone's here to have a good time, and no one's trying to impress anyone. It's loud, rowdy, and maybe a little dirty. My kinda place! ;)",

Walked into a circular bar with a huge stage and dance floor. The bartenders are awesome and do so many tricks and keep you really entertained while they make your drinks. It was pretty packed but we got drinks rather quickly. My friend did their \"BJ drink\" for $25 which we both thought was really pricey but wanted the experience. I only took videos but the drink is pretty hilarious and the bartender plays along while she was drinking. The funniest thing ever if you're into stuff like that! The DJ was legit and played a bunch of rap that we danced to alllll night. They have a spacious dance floor so you can actually dance and not feel like a sardine. They also had a band that night named, Mr. And Mrs. Smith who covered pop songs and they were legit. Very entertaining and kept the partying going. Overall this was a great night for free entry and affordable drinks. I will be coming back here next trip.",

I had so much fun here and yeah the people there can get a little weird/drunk/annoying but as long as you and your group are having a good time you usually don't notice the bad apples. Each time I went was during the day so didn't have to worry about a cover. Also, the bathroom is indeed inside Harrah's but never had a problem walking to them, the walk isn't too bad. I rather walk than have to wait in a long line which I never encountered.   The band was HILARIOUS and constantly had me laughing with their silly contests, noises, dancing, etc. The flare bartenders are great and make really good drinks. I never once complained about a drink that they served me. It's so fun watching them do their thing and screaming for them and the free shots?? The shots don't taste the greatest and I'm convinced there really isn't very much alcohol in them and found them to leave my face and hands sticky but the fun is in taking the shots. Nothing like giving the bartender a $1 or more and having them pour it directly into your mouth while everyone around you cheers. Good times!  Carnaval Court is my new favorite place to drink during the day. Go early in the afternoon and get a table at the bar. So much more fun than standing on the outside. Trust me.",

The drink was delicious and was made from scratch (all the other places selling drinks in the 100oz containers all are made with a variety of different flavored slushy premix crap that is super sweet and contains little alcohol).  This one drink had us both feeling quite lovely.    The bartender was a bit standoffish probably from dealing with drunk people constantly...

It kinda reminds me of some of my favorite bars in Sturgis! The bartenders are always doing tricks, throwing bottles, doing fun shots, etc.  It does have a mixed crowd, but that is always a recipe for some awesome people watching, and you never know what is gonna happen.  I would definitely recommend this place. It is not a super chic, \"Vegas\" type place, so be forwarned!",

    "text": "The Carnaval Court Bar & Grill is the infamous spot seen on TV where bartenders are throwing bottles around and making drinks in the process.  On this occasion, I did not go inside the bar, instead, I got a yard drink from the bar outside the entrance.  The yard drink is expensive, but is expected and the last time I had one, I was drunk for about eight hours.  The damage was $40, but worth it as I really liked the yard glass, which had the Welcome to Las Vegas sign at the bottom that lights up.  The drink itself wasn't as great as my previous one, but was strong enough to give me a bit of a buzz before I headed to the airport. I'm deducting one star because the drink wasn't as strong as I anticipated and didn't do much damage. I'll be back in the future and actually sit at the bar and watch the shows as they make drinks, but for now Carnaval Court Bar gets an average three stars.",

Keep in mind that this bar is outdoors and quality of your time here is really contingent on the weather.

The \"flare\" bar tending here is absolute sight to see, their performances are really unbelievable. That being said, make sure you tip well.   I wouldn't make this place my nighttime destination, but if you're trekking the strip and need a place to wind down, people watch, and get some R&R in while simultaneously entertained by the bartending...i highly recommend this place -- you won't be disappointed.   One of the bar tenders there, Robyn I think--she is gorgeous!! And I don't say that about many people.",

    "text": "I have to reiterate some of the claims that alot of people are saying about this place. My wildest moments in Vegas were probably had had at this venue. Carnival Court is probably the most underrated venue in all of LV, probably because it doesn't get much hype as some of the other snootier, fancier, hotel clubs get. There are no excessively long lines to wait in, there are no bouncers that you have to tip, there are no outrageous entry fees, there are no separate \"female only\" lines, there are no mandatory male / female ratios needed to enter. All you need is a good party vibe and maybe a few other folks looking to have a good time.  There are two good things about this venue: The first are the flair bartenders. I dunno if he's still there, but there's this \"asian Tom Cruise\" who can juggle Grey Goose bottles all day while pouring 12 shot glasses in a matter of seconds. These guys know how to work the crowd, and the best part happens when there are $1 shots. The other good thing is the live band that plays all your favorite music. They play a good mash up of rock, 80's, and generally any feel good party song. Then they take a break, so the DJ comes out and he starts spinning some hip hop. I've taken all my friends to this venue who have never been there, and they've all had good things to say about it.  If you're looking for a non-pretentious place to party, Carnival Court is it.",

I always visit when there is a live band. Great talents playing rock, hip hop and pop. No worries if its cold out because the giant ceiling heaters keep you warm as well as the dancing cage girls.

I think it was the same guy the nights of 8/19 and 8/20; however, I could be wrong.  And to the chick from Dayton, give me back my 50th anniversary Starboard coozie!  I definitely remember Mr. $ Mrs. Smith who was the band that played on Saturday night, and they were fuggin awesome.  Very energetic and cranked out lots of radio hits and 90's g-funk rap.  They have \"free shots\" every now and then at the bar which actually cost $5.  A bartender stands up on the bar and pours directly into your mouth until you say stop or he thinks you've had enough.  The buckets of beer are clutch since it'll save you some trips to the bar.  You can just put them on the edge of the stage.  We must have had 5 or 6 at a time lined up.  My tabs were pretty ugly both nights, but there was a large group of us, and we drink like fish.  It's a covered open air area which reminds of the old Bohager's in Baltimore if anyone remembers that.  The one drawback is there aren't any bathrooms inside, so you have to leave and go into the Harrah's bathroom closest to the piano bar.",

    "text": "Fun place but I have been pick pocketed here back in 2014 as there can at times be little gangs of thieves looking for their next victims. If you see dudes in derby's be careful. Also watch your drinks. Multiple times we have had dudes swip beers . Bartenders here though are a blast for most part. Music here is fantastic . I have had literally the most fun in Vegas here meeting new people and dancing the night away. After Superbowl party here is a blast! This place is for dancing and flirting. It can get chilly in spots here in the winter. Usually on weekends they have blackjack going as well. Prices here great compared to other nightclubs but you do get what you pay for. People are dressed very casual here, both women and men. Sometimes they hit you with a $5 cover and that is usually on weekends or big events. Been coming here for years, and will keep coming here, just be careful as they do not really keep out the punks at this venue.",

Makes sense). Now Mr. And Mrs. Smith are alt / classic rock. That's okay but the only reason I came here every time I came to Vegas was FOR THE AWESOME R&B concert that Mr. and Mrs put on. Now. I'm going to have to find a new haunt. Please Mr. And Mrs. Smith, bring back the R&B. If you are wondering why the dance floor clears when you are on stage, this is why. The DJ (who looks a little like Andy Dick) is pretty good though. He keeps the R&B vibe kicking. So 4 stars for him.",

    "text": "Went here midweek around 9pm and it was pretty empty. When we first arrived there was a band playing which was very good, playing mostly 70's and 80's music. After maybe a half hour a deejay took over. There is no glitz or glam here, not the interior of what most people envision as a typical Vegas nightclub. It's pretty bare and stark with a large circular bar when you first walk in. On the other side of the bar are tables and a dance floor in front of the stage. Friendly bartenders, older crowd, very casual, and good people watching. I don't really have anything negative to say. But some describe this place as the best bar in Vegas and that's where I disagree. If your younger and use to glitz and glam of Vegas nightlife you won't like this place. If your older and want to listen to live bands without the young crowd you will love it here.",

There is no cover charge until they get really packed so make sure to get there early and don't leave your table. The only thing i would say is the seating is a bit sparce and some over the waitress are not too friendly. Go go Go",

What was originally one drink lasted quite a bit longer thanks to some very friendly and attentive bartenders, and an ample amount of red-faced, good -natured tourists. The body shot whistle got old after the first, by the fourth it would have been a killer but the atmosphere and the music made up for it. Definitely an older crowd (30's, 40s) which we liked, as it cuts down (usually) on random jerkishness.  Next time we're back we'll definitely stop by for a few rum drinks, maybe some blackjack.",

So barney B waited, got tagged, and hung loose.  douchenozzles represent?  check. half talented band cranking?  well, to be honest the band did exactly waht they needed to do - so I'd give them more credit than just 'half talented' and did our friends have a blast? double check.  ok, there's not a chance in hell I am ever coming back here - but it was enjoyable seeing my friends sweat off beer on the dance area, as well as watch random 'couples' break out into impromptu lap dances.  and if this is your scene and can deal with the inevitable drunk DN grinding on you, dude or girl - then swing on by - they like to party and make noise and so do you, right?",

Yes, the atmosphere is pretty nice, which is what drew me to the place initially. The loud music, and the stage at the back with performances happening nightly are appealing. Still, the Gin & Tonic was $ 12, and it wasn't very good. If your're here for good drinks, there are much better places out there. If, on the other hand, you're here for the atmosphere, you will have a good time.",

When we got here, we were already intoxicated, but he decided to go ahead and order 2 margarita on the rocks, big souvenir cup thingys which were like $40 each. I think we both had taken like 4 sips before he swung his arms in the air because of excitement that they were playing his \"jam,\" and WHAM! There went our drinks! Lmao. What a waste!!! Tsk, tsk. We weren't going to let that ruin our night though. The DJ was playing good music, so we stuck around and danced a bit. My second visit there, was for a cousins 21st birthday. The bartenders seem very full of energy, and seem to enjoy their jobs. Making it even exciting to see them make your drink. Our job was definitely done here. Getting the birthday boy plastered! This time, there was a band playing. I honestly, didn't care for the band. But I mean, its Vegas, and we were with a big group of people who were going to make wherever we were fun.  I'd say this is a good spot to START your night. :)",

Vegas is Vegas....people will drink and be crazy and let loose but all in all, want to be in a safe environment.  This place has the unfortunate luck to have a resident predator they can't seem to rid themselves of and I think ladies need to be aware.  His name is Francois...for lack of a better description...he looks like a meathead on steroids....this night he was in a tight tattoo design t-shirt.  Short, crewcut-like blondish/lighter color hair.  And there is nothing French or even the hint of an accent about him.  He says he owns the place, will buy you a helicopter, just a whole bunch of BS.  Guys like this are seriously a dime a dozen and if you are out for a fun time, he's almost entertaining in the crap he is trying to convince you of...but I'm sure there are plenty of gals who buy it.  He suggests dancing on the dance floor which is a short walk down in front of the bar...I'm up for a dance in a crowd, why not, we're just having fun...but when I ask why my girlfriend isn't joining...or why I can't go get her...he is kind of pushy and trying to get me dance...give me the fur coat off the DJs back.  Then the rude, crude, very sexual and aggressive/borderline scary comments begin.  He brings another guy who he says was a fireman over who is just looking as predator-ish as Francois.  Again, this is all par for the course in Vegas...douchebags.  But..this guy apparently sets up camp nightly here at the Carnaval Court outside Harrah's and then moves to the Linq late late (while his wife is at home!!  Double douchbag)....spewing the SAME story to any gal who will listen and fall for it.  My concern is his very aggressive and violent sexual comments which are probably indicative of his overall demeanor.  What happens when a girl wises up later on and tries to leave and is abused when there isn't a crowd around??  I think this guy should be 86'd from this bar....even though he is technically doing nothing illegal in all his lying, guests shouldn't have to worry about their safety when they are just trying to have some good Vegas fun.  SO GALS...BEWARE.  LOOK OUT FOR THIS GUY...I wish I had a pic but all the staff knows about him and they just don't know what to do about him.  Spread the word, be safe, have fun....and definitely have a cocktail with the uber talented bartenders here.  They all get 5 stars for sure!!",

The bartenders would do all these fancy tricks. There were lots of people around (dancing on the small dance floor, in front of the stage) and lots of people passing by would stop to see what the heck was going on- on stage and around the circular outside bar- unique outside setting (but comes in handy for when you want to cool off from shaking your booty). There was table seating around but usually a person in your group had to get the table to save- or stalk someone you think is leaving. Parking is at the casino garage and it's a long walk from the casino but it's such a fun place (it's worth it, but if you're drunk, on the other hand, it might seem like an eternity).",

After spending most of the weekend in Vegas dressed up in heels and tight dresses, my girls and I were thrilled to walk into CC in jeans and flip flops and stayed until 4am without even realizing it! Such a great time!!",

Everytime I go to Vegas I make an attempt to  go here. The bartenders are hilarious (somewhat perverted) and very talented. I always buy a 1/2 yard of some sort of drink here which usually makes me pass out somewhere later in the afternoon. Last year I passed out at La Salsa at Caesar's after I finished my drink. The bartender Flippy usually has a heavy hand.  From the water/alcohol fights between bartenders, to the girl customers shoving tip money between their boobs for the bartenders to get... It's just a really fun place to be in the daytime in Vegas. During the band's break the bartenders usually have contests or games of some sort to get the crowd riled up.   The first time I came here was in August 2004 and the bartenders have remained the same. I wouldn't leave this job either considering the massive amount of money it seems they make in tips. It can get a bit raunchy at times, but it's always a good time (pending weather of course).",

No cover (in the daytime), lots of friendly tourists, a great cover band, amazing flair bartenders, no dress code (as far as I can tell) and very little attitude.  The place is a big outdoor venue and a great place for some daytime drinking.   Nighttime is pretty fun too!  Its a great alternative to waiting hours in line at some overpriced \"ultra-lounge\" and spending a fortune on drinks once you get in.",

We were there first, so no problem.  We were there for FOUR hours drinking one of those like 4 ft long drinks that comes on a necklace so when you are so drunk you can't hold your drink up it doesn't fall over haha.  We probably got 10 free shots while we were there.  The bartenders are \"flair\" tenders and are amazing at what they do.  We had the best time ever and are looking forward to going back, hopefully this weekend! Don't be afraid to get the big drink and tip! It's worth it! They'll give you all the free shots you want of their \"secret\" mix! Although we did tip a lot and that might be why! I LOVE YOU FLIPPY!!",

    "text": "When friends and I were in Vegas last month, us girls were looking for a place to dance one of the nights we would be there. We didn't really feel like dealing with any of the insanely packed dance clubs that feature celebs and high priced covers, so someone mentioned this place. Since we were right across the street staying at the Mirage, we were down to give it a try.   I have to say this is the most fun I've had dancing in Vegas.   There was a live band playing which played a mixture of classic rock, mainstream rock, etc. Then around midnight, a DJ starting playing 90s rap music which brought us back to our high school days.  Not everyone was dancing, so it was a perfect sized area for those that wanted to be up by the stage.   The bartenders were entertaining with their bottle juggling and they seemed to make decently booze filled drinks, but the prices made my bunghole cringe! $16 for a long island in a small plastic cup? I think my friends vodka/cran was $13.  What I always like to do is bring a flask and fill it up in the room before I head anywhere on the strip because I'm cheap like that. Then order a coke/juice and fill it up when they're not looking. This place is dark enough and there's quite enough seats that you most definitely won't be caught. Screw em for charging these inflated prices!  The DJ will often throughout the night offer up free shots from the bartenders to get the crowd lively. I opted to get a free shot, but it wasn't worth the $5 tip that my husband left. It was like a lime margarita mix. PFFT.  Also, this place is filled with people in their late 20s-50s. A wide variety of ages can be seen here. At least the night we came.  It was kind of funny. The DJ put on a Michael Jackson song, and my husband started busting out the moon walk and you could see a flock of cougars swarm him like flies around shit. I couldn't stop laughing, but we all had fun, so it was worth it.  Whenever I'm back in Vegas, I'll be sure to stay at this end of the strip just so I can go back to Carnaval Court.  BTW, where's the bathroom? You get dinged a star for this since you almost made me pee my pants.",

This place I've been to every time my friend has been in town (so probably about 4 times) and then once when another friend came into town who's never been. I would choose this bar over any night club. There's no cover charge, drinks are amazing, BARTENDERS AND THE ATMOSPHERE they bring are the reason why I love it! I definitely come here only when I have the means to uh....get drunk that night. To me it's not just a bar you go to to have one casual drink, no, you go there to DRINK. Or atleast start or end your night there. The tall drinks they serve well worth the price tag, the load those things with whatever you want! You only need one! There's a bartender there I absolutely adore, remembers me every time. Haven't been back in a few months, I miss it, but like I said, it's a place to get drunk and well, I haven't been doing that hahahha. Can't wait to go back. Love love love.",

Partied one night in shorts and a tshirt and the next night in a tie and slacks, why you ask? Because this is Carnival Court, and the rules don't apply here, just getting drunk and having a good time!! Spend at least one night here and enjoy the break from the overpriced pretentious Vegas club scene and have the time of your life!!",

It wasn't really him of course. But the crowd went crazy over his moonwalks and crotch-grabs. 4) watch the \"sexiest DJ in Vegas\" spin? Can't say I agree with the sexiest part, but she's one of those platinum blonde barbie girls. I guess that's sexy. 5) form a dance circle and do the running man in flipflops? 6) have a full yard margarita strapped to your neck as you grind to Flo-rida?  Yes, there were spilled drinks on the ground. Big deal. Its the same with clubs that people pay 30 bucks to get in. It's not the place, but what you make of it.

Live band and DJ, doesn't matter, both rock!  My only wishes are that they'd serve food and that they'd stay open later!  We've danced many a night away at this fun little club!",

Went to outside bar and got a drink because he was too busy catering to the 4 guys at the bar. Long story short, got \"Vegased\" but met some Gusties, some Mavericks and some Saints from Scholastica. All in all a good night if not for the bullshit. Worth it just  for connecting with the Mn peeps.",

The vibe just wasn't good here music wise staff wise and all around make sure you skip this because there's a million other places directly on the strip that have good times written all over them.

My only reason for dropping this to a 4 star review is due to my concern with the recent change to fewer bands.  I was there on a Wednesday night recently and they had some Karaoke thing happening.  I also heard they were greatly reducing the Droids and the Whip-It's days and stage time.  If that is True this is a huge mistake.  This place is crazy busy and fun when bands are playing and much slower when not.  I know change is a constant in Vegas but people are always looking for live music on the strip and this place has been the best option for years.  If management from Harrah's is listening, please keep the live music at Carnaval Court, especially the Droids and Whip-It's, with a shout out to the Garage Boys as well!!  Carnaval Court is so many people's go to place on the strip due to the bartenders and bands, please keep both going strong!!",

They check IDs at the door but there's no cover and there's no outside food/drink allowed. (Had to say goodbye to my Fat Tuesday but it was worth it!)  We missed the live band the first night. By the time we got there only the DJ was playing but the music was awesome. There was a good mix of old school and mainstream music as well as a variety of genres.  Dancing here was a lot of fun and it was just a chill vibe. We left pretty late and it was still going on.  Definitely going to be a regular spot from here on out.",

Next time you hire another waitress make sure they don't have an attitude please. We went for my husbands birthday and was having a great time till they charged us twice for the same thing then everything went south. The waitress we had from the beginning was rude and not that much fun to have around. She ended up disappearing and never coming back so we asked another waitress that was walking around for a couple drinks. She was nice at first went got our drinks came back with the check we paid and then she left.      Finally the other waitress comes back and dropped off the same check my husband didn't notice at first and I came and told him no your mom just paid that for us don't pay again. Well that didn't sit well with the waitress, she flipped out on my mother in law and then came and flipped out on my husband and said \"pay the tab get out of here, security is coming.\" When I went to politely tell her about the check she turned flipped me off and walked away, then came back with security who wouldn't even talk to me.      I told them let me just get our friends and we are gone. As we were leaving I went to walk back to our table to grab my beer and that same waitress came right up and took it away I told her hey I'm still drinking that but she continued to ignore me and walk away. At this point my patience was running thin so I got out of there and now will never come back. Me, my friends, and family were treated so bad for no reason and we spent good money there, were we wrong for not wanting to be charged double?",

Bartenders It's a hit or miss, some of the them are cool, good and can make a Hell of a drink, others are rude, don't show the flare and don't even notice that you're there unless you're flashing money around.  Price It comes with the bartender, if you got a great drink that was made well, the pricing will be awesome, if you got a drink that wasn't up to your standards, it'll feel like you're paying too much.  Overall It's a place to go to a little later in the night when you're having a good time with friends (also when you're a tad bit drunk), it's a place to enjoy a quick dance, get an average drink, and just keep the night going.",

We got there about 8 before they charged a cover and got a table close to the bar.. they have a DJ and a cover band that plays all kinds of great dance music... they even have good looking GoGo dancers.. its so nice how its open so your not dying of heat or feeling like sardines... the bartenders do their flare and that is fun to watch... if you tip well the bartenders take good care of you!! dont be cheap people tip your bartenders well!!!

If you have the itch to play blackjack, Carnaval Court also has blackjack tables!  The only reason I gave 4 stars is sometimes it can take forever to get a drink if the place is busy.  My words of advice, double up on your drinks when you order, or go to the bar by the main entrance to get your drinks.",

It was a circular bar tucked in the middle of no where. What I liked most about it was that it was an outdoor bar!  We were there for about half an hour and it was so much fun! Every hour or so, the bartenders would start blowing their whistles and they would entertain their guests with flair bartending. They also offered free shots, but in order to get one, you have to succumb to whatever madness they think of. One girl from our group was asked to lean her head back onto the bar, kind of like when you're doing the limbo. She was blind folded with a wet towel, ice was placed into her cleavage, and a stream of vodka was poured into her mouth. It was so funny!  The drinks are cheap here and the shots are huge! I definitely recommend!",

I got in here for free courtesy of the Yelp Spring Break guide, although there's no cover here during the day...maybe later in the night, there may be.  The band playing was fronted by a lady who did a few songs decent until she got to Journey's \"Don't Start Believing.\"  Gulp...I switched off after that...who can do that song justice besides the original Steve Perry?  Anyways, I got a drink and sat down to chill and watch the show while the show at the Carnaval bar area was in full effect.  The whistles, the wildness, the flair moves made this area very exciting and entertaining to watch up close and afar.  I can imagine that at night, this place must be even more jumping.  The whistles were a bit irritating because it did interfere with the concert performers but I guess that can't be helped, right?  Props though for them playing \"Bad Girl\" by Donna Summer in honor of her recent passing.  Will likely come back here if my group decides on it but no way am I sitting at the bar to have hard alcohol poured down my throat blindfolded!",

Tips:  -get there before the cover starts (I think its like 830) -park in Harrahs  - Tip good from the start -Make requests at the band, have a great time!",

The crowd is always a good mix of talent, craziness, and folks just looking for a place to have a good time and enjoy themselves.  While the bar itself is covered by a round roof, the outdoors openness of the place is one of the things that makes it attractive.  They have their own outdoor stage and typically they have good bands of all sorts playing.  Any time I have ever been there I have not seen a bad band playing, at least not yet.  The bartenders are some of if not the best.  Known for their bottle tossing and general serving tricks and antics, they are what really draw the crowd here.  I have seen some of the craziest tricks done behind a bar here; and you can see it all any time you go to this place.  Of course, the guys really like to perform for the women, so you stand a better chance of seeing something wild if you are a woman; and you may even be served a little faster because of it too.  As a guy, it's really the only drawback to the place.  Of course, the service overall is really good at the bar and you will not be disappointed watching (the bartenders or the women) while you wait.   I have had a good time every time I have been to this bar whether I'm people watching or enjoying the tricks behind the bar.  With a group of your friends, the place is even better.  Anytime you visit Vegas, make it a point to visit Carnaval Court.  I do.",

When I was lining up for mine, I saw the people in front of us ordered jager bomb, and the bartender poured almost 1/3 of a bottle of jager into that yard vessel. That's about 8 shots there! Then they poured about 3 cans of redbull in there.The redbull vodka my friends and I got was mighty strong and definitely got me real buzzed and not wanting redbull vodka ever again.   The atmosphere was great here also. You can sit or stand. There's loud music, dancers and great crowd who shake it like they mean it--definitely like a real carnival that's located on the strip.",

    "text": "Howdy Tourist :) You have been warned!  I have been here a couple of times over the years and find it overrated from a locals perspective. I guess I am just used to all of the locals spots and the great Happy Hour deals and other entertainment spots our town has to offer.   I must have visited on the wrong nights, not a whole lot of flair action going on?   I remember one time when I was feeling bad when a date paid $32 bucks not including tip for two long island drinks in an 8oz cup full of ice. Bad Bad Bad. Rip off city! I never want to go here on purpose, I am always dragged here by friends and such, ugh.   If you like beer then you can fare better, purchase the plastic pitchers of beer.  It is more about the surroundings and experience then it is the drinking and getting drunk, because that won't happen.  The drinks are weak, very weak in my opinion. I could have made a packet of kool-aid at home.  Don't waste your time going here in the day time, it is just hot since it is an outdoor bar and it is boring.  This review is more of a piece of advice for the tourists and visitors of Las Vegas who I am sure will run into Carnaval Court at some point. If you want a good time here, make sure you withdraw your life's savings in order to obtain your goal of getting a buzz!   The service from the bartender's is hit and miss really depending on who is on shift during your visit. A few of them are nice and attentive, a couple of them are just plain cocky and appear to be more focused on selecting who they will be getting their freak on with that night.   Remember folks...what happens in Vegas shows up on your test results.   Have a nice day :)",

    "text": "It's practically a frat party!! All I gotta say is this place is pure mayhem..it's definitley a step away from typical vegas nightlife, but its a crazy good time at the carnival.  It's like a jungle in here. You got some beautiful looking creatures, some not so good looking ones, and ones that are just horrendous. However everybody is there to get wasted.   The whole setup is outside, and it's underneath a tent. It was very cracking on the summer night that I went since the weather was perfect. The bar was on the upper level, and it's huge so you won't have a problem getting a drink. The only annoying thing is that the bartenders attempt too much flair and sometimes you don't want to watch and you just want your drink! There's also plenty of seating as well.  If you like to dance, drink, and party hard this is your place to be! I don't think I ever danced with so many crazy white girls EVER. best part on top of that, was that I didn't have to pay cover as well!",

    "text": "I went there to celebrate my 30th birthday with a group of friends and Family. As I was sitting down on a chair we had all of our belongings on two tables, there were 2 girls started putting our stuff on the ground and moving the tables towards them. I told them that the tables were already being used. (as we were sitting there) Her friend kept moving our purses and jackets and she starts yelling at me calling me names, spit on me, started hitting me. A huge fight breaks out, my Sister stops her other friend who is also trying to attack me and they fall to the ground. My Husband and Brother runs over to separate the fight, their thug male friends also getting in telling the girls to continue to hit us and use the weapons they supposedly had in their purses. The Carnival Court security officers throw my Husband and Brother to the ground punching them both in the ribs and shoving my brother in laws face into the ground and another used his foot to keep my Husbands head on the ground. We also got detained and said we had to be held until Metro PD got there. We all have black eyes, scratches and spit all over our faces but one of the Carnival Court security lets the thugs go and tells them to run while we are held down because the police were being called. We then tell our side of the story and the one security guard tells us that it's our fault and we asked for all this because there's no saved seats. The thugs were moving our personal belongings on the floor and taking the tables and chairs as we were using them. Metro finally shows up, we are still detained, it was very embarrassing, everyone was staring at us and security guards were laughing at us. When metro asked the security guards where the other party was so they can be questioned they told them they were let go. Metro couldn't even believe the situation. We couldn't even press charges because the security guards let them go and told them to run far because metro was being called. I tried calling management the next day and they just gave me the run around. No one ever got back to me.",

I have made a trip here ever since I wandered in about 5 years ago, and it hasn't changed one bit!  I even recognize some of the bartenders as I return year after year.  Feels like home!  Haha wait...does that mean I have a Carnaval Court problem?  Perhaps.    Headed back for another trip next week and can't wait!

When i went during the day, they had a live band. There was quite a few people around the bar and in the table areas to the side but not many people on the dance floor. The drinks are good but pricey, but then again, so is everything in Vegas. They did give out free shots if the bartender could balance bottles and glasses on his head and walk around the bar without dropping them. The bartenders were nice and fun entertainment. At night there was a DJ and the music was really good. There was a lot of people dancing, it felt more like a club. It was free to get in as well. I had so much fun here, I definitely would visit again in the future.",

This year we were all Pretty disappointed as the wait in the bar area was so outrageous we ended up going to the bar outside of the area to get our drinks. If the bar was busy this makes sense, but there was hardly any people in line and on top of tap there was at a minimum 5 bartenders.   The band was awesome as it always is and is one of the reasons we come here to party, however the DJ was terrible and many people in my group and people outside my group commented on it. There was too much changing of songs mid song. This is not a modern club and that's why we are attracted to it. Having a modern DJ takes away the charm, we left earlier than we ever have any other year. We know 3 groups of people from 3 other states who also come here on the same weekend every year and they were also disappointed.",

HOWEVER - we had the grave displeasure of dealing with \"Ruggs\" the bartender. He was by far the rudest bartender I've ever met. He was high energy but short with everyone, he even verbally accosted this woman because she touched his tips - \"you're stealing from me! I'm going to call the cops on you bitch!\" When in reality, the woman had picked up his tip after it fell to the floor. I'm fairly certain this man was on drugs. He was acting crazy and we almost left the bar because of how uncomfortable and unwelcome he made us feel.   Had the manager not stepped in and asked him to take a break, we would have left, and never had he pleasure of meeting Renee and the rest of the crew.  I'd recommend coming here for sure - no outrageous gimmicks or covers. Very generous pours and a good time. Just avoid that bartender if you can...",

The drinks were good, and for those who do not drink the liquid courage gave them the courage to dance.  This is totally a great spot for a large group too.    Drinks were average prices and at 2am the party was still going.  This is a fun spot mostly for a mid 30's and up since the cover band this particular day was hitting all the 90's and late early 2000's hits.   I'm sure there are different bands each week so check out the lineup before you go so you can make sure you have the type of music you want.",

Since O'Sheas closed, this has become one of the places we hang out, this is not a high end hang out place, this is somewhere to kick back and relax.  The downside is, though there are food places around the bar, you can't actually take food into the bar area, strange, but that's about it.  One great addition has been a band called The Garage Boys, they moved over from O'Sheas and now play there every other week, they play everything, from Vanilla Ice, to MotorHead to a hilarious cover of Shania Twain's \"I feel like a woman\"",

The crowd around the bar is such an eclectic mix of young, old, hot and not. The bartenders are known for the flair, which gets more and more entertaining the more you drink.   After fighting my hangover from the night before, we walked down to this bar and decided to drink away our sorrows. The mixture of the live DJ's, people dancing, and drinks flowing was enough to get me back in the groove.   I would not spend the entire night in LV here, in fact I don't know if I would even spend any of my evening hours drinking here... But it is definitely the spot to pre-drink and get your early party on before heading to a club or lounge.",

    "text": "Many Vegas locals claim they never visit the Strip because it's too expensive and full of pesky tourists. Not me. One of my favorite places in Vegas is Carnaval Court at Harrah's.  I first walked into Carnaval Court three years ago when I first moved to Vegas, and it's now become my second home. Why? Because it's one of those bars that doesn't have that \"Strip\" feel even though it's smack dab in the middle of the thing.  The bartenders put on an amazing show, the drinks are strong enough to put you three times over the limit with one glass, the live band (The Crashers) seems to always be a crowd favorite, and you can always expect your shoes to be stuck to the floor by the end of the night.   It's not just any bar, though. As well as the live music, there's a free show at the bar, too, courtesy of the flair bartenders (my favorites are Duane and Rene), who juggle three bottles at a time or balance a stack on their head topped off with a little fire (really, fire). There are even go-go dancers and a hookah bar, both new introductions in the last couple of months, as well as games of blackjack being played on the patio.   Beers start at $7 for a Bud or $11 for a well drink, and there's a cover charge on weekends, even for women, but I think it's well worth it.  If drinking, dancing, gambling and seeing some great flair bar tending is your thing, come on down to Carnaval Court and see why I keep coming back.",

But unless you are of that demographic (alcoholic trailer-park-dwelling assembly-line-worker-on-vacation-from-Rustbucket, USA), you might share my low opinion of this depressing place.    Carnaval Court tries really hard to be cheerful and fun.  REALLY HARD!  But all the ear-splittingly-loud Bon Jovi covers and manically juggled cheap booze in the world can't mask the oppresively depressing nature of the bar's denizens: blue collar mooks, on perpetual Spring Break from a third-tier community college, desperate to bag whatever beat-up white trash trim they can scare up.  Bachelerotte parties celebrating some unfortunate muffin-topped truck-stop waitress's thrird marriage.  Bowling alley attendants and their factory-worker wives, gaping maws open wide and turned up like baby birds to catch the cheap drizzle of sticky booze being poured down like proletariat manna by the bartenders, who tend to get up on the bar and tease the patrons with \"free shots\" poured directly from unmarked bottles.  Good times!  Actually, this place would be pretty good people watching, if it weren't so ear-splittingly, soul-shatteringly LOUD!  Not only does the live cover band BLARE one played-out  classic rock party anthem after another, but the bartenders (seemingly all 500 of them) constantly blast shrilly into the metal whistles tightly clamped in their grimaces, and repeatedly bang their metal cocktail shakers onto the metal bar... OVER and OVER and OVER, in a grim, desperate attempt at merrymaking.  This place is DETERMINED TO MANUFACTURE FUN OUT OF NOISE, as if sound waves can conquer misery and squalor.  Good luck with, that, guys!!!",

She is into the glam of the more private clubs but this time around she was able to dress down and relax.  She was even tipped to tip for a tequila shot.  Sat at the bar in \"Josh's\" ---aka \"NINJA\"---section, as we always do and...as always, we were far from being disappointed.  Kudos to bartender \"Rene\" who made my husband feel sooo special by getting him a bar seat from the other side of the bar just to make sure he was taken care of.

The music is loud so I always come prepared with my earplugs.  Thank goodness there are misters to help with the heat.  The bartenders are what make this place ROCK! They are friendly and so hilarious.  This place is great for people watching.

With a decent tip, they are also attentive. If they had just one microbrew, I'd give it an extra star.  The music was pretty much pop/dance style stuff, so if that's your thing, not too bad. If you're looking for some hard rock, probably not going to find it.  I had a good enough time as it was a chance to wind down with the wedding party after a busy day.

Drinks I feel are on the pricey side, but definitely worth the entertainment from bartenders, live entertainment and again, mix of people that roll in/out of that place. Best of all, C.Court is outside!  So, you can get your drink on, gamble on and dance on at this one stop shop!  CONS:  For a place that NEVER used to charge, they've gone to charging men and NOW women after 9PM. There is nothing different about this place, so why the cover charge?  They also put in cheap leather looking booth seating with a cheesy sign for VIP/Bottle service. There is nothing VIP about this place other than just being able to have a designated place to sit. Not worth the extra money, don't fall for that bs!  Carnival Court should NOT charge to get in. This is not a club. All walks of life go into this place and to start projecting C.Court as a club is really comical.",

The bartenders are fun and if you tip them well they'll hook you up.  The place is in a tent outdoors right on the strip.  You can valet at Harah's next door if you have a car.  It's free to get in but there is a bouncer checking ID's.  The drinks are a little expensive but like I said make it worth it and tip better.  I'm pretty sure a DJ plays all day but I've only seen it crowded at night.  It's a fun place to stop for a drink while walking the strip no matter what time it is.  My only dilemma with this place is why not refill the Yards?  It's a tough job carrying those things around.",

    "text": "Harrah's has a smart business module when it comes to Carnaval Court. It is situation on a pathway that sucks tourist in. With all the kiosks around, it has useless souvenirs within drunken reach. Even though my friends and I were not inebriated, we still bought those shirts that light up to the music. Thinking they were the epitome of cheesy tourist, we all bought matching shirts to signify our unity.   Entering the party scene with our newly acquired garments garnered so much attention and compliments. The dance floor is large and provides enough room to get down. Being outside helps alleviate the overheating that sometimes occurs when the dance floor gets too crowded.   The flare bartenders are fun to watch and make a decent cocktail. If you want to alternate between partying and gambling, this is the perfect venue because they have table games set aside as well. It has everything someone coming to Vegas is looking for.",

It's very inviting and makes you want to hang out for a while. It's a covered patio so in the heat of the summer it's a nice and shady place to sit and relax.  The only reason I don't give this place 5 stars is that their drinks are pretty pricey. Not any more so than other parts of the strip, but they don't have a happy hour (at least that I'm aware of) and they've never had drink specials when I've been there either. I was there on St. Patrick's Day and although they had green beer, they didn't have any special shots or pricing that would entice me to stay longer.  The bartenders are friendly, they make fun drinks, blow whistles, etc. It's sure to be a good time no matter when you stop by.",

From staff suggestion, they set off to the Carnaval tent, full of hope for expert mixologists, twirling bottles and slinging drinks to the stars. As these adventurers arrived, their concern grew. The decor was non-existent. The music distorted. The clientele bare. But still their thirst remained unquenched. They order three drinks, $50 total. Steep, but for classy cocktails, expected. They arrive in plastic cups, with black smoothie straws. The maraschino cherry seemed to have seen better days. After a few sips, they realized the tent (hopefully) had seen better days. With a sigh of despair, they surveyed the land for a place of redemption...a place where the subtlety of the ice clinking against crystal complimented the knife edge balance of the spirits. Where the art of subtlety was appreciated. The Dorsey, where a new adventure awaited...",

It's nice to just drop it when you're wandering around outside. The cover bands are usually great. Last time I was there beer pitchers were 2 big pitchers for $10 ($5 a pitcher on the strip? hell yes).   So the crowd isn't the hottest... it's not the place to pick up a young hot thing or a sugar daddy. However in my book that's what makes this place freaking awesome.",

I walk further out and DAMN...there was a lot of people.  Carnaval Court Bar & Grill is not just the stage and bar, but its like a big-small carnaval...lol. I just got sodas, in which, I forgot what the price was, but it was very reasonable. I don't usually stay for concerts, but the band was great on 10/7/2010 evening. A lot of people who were having fun and having a drink.  Harrah's is my brand of hotel. I only stay at MGM if someone else pays for it. Harrah's had great entertainment and great place to just relax. Sorry I couldn't write much, but I think you should just see for yourself in Vegas.  Have Fun here and Keep Yelping!!",

    "text": "This last 4th of July weekend was my second visit to Carnaval Court (third, if you count the TWO times we went during the trip) and my impression of the place hasn't changed. If you're looking for somewhere fun, casual, and incredibly boozy, then this is definitely your place. I've yet to tread the waters of the fancy-schmancy nightclubs and ultra lounges, but this place is definitely more my style.   Carnaval Court, plain and simple, is a place to party. No, not that kind of \"dress-up-in-your-best-clothes-and-go-wait-in-line-for-an-hour-and-a-half\" kind of party that you might see from the headlining clubs in Vegas. It's more of a place where you can let loose and not worry about what clothes you're wearing. Seriously, there were some people there that LITERALLY came straight from the gym. It's a completely different atmosphere (at least I'd imagine) that promotes fun over flash. I mean, it's located between two of the most budget-conscious casinos on the entire Strip, so you really can't come here expecting anything more than   So I guess the big question is, \"How are the drinks?\" If I could answer that in one word, I'd go with \"generous.\" Typically $8 for shots, which is a little pricey compared to some of the bottom-of-the-barrel drink choices on the Strip, but when you end up with a \"shot\" that's essentially the size of your fist, you really can't complain. Not to mention all the bartenders there really do know how to put on a show for you, sometimes pouring up to eight separate shots simultaneously! It's a sight to behold, really.  As for music, they had The Crashers there that night (an exceptionally decent cover band that'll even take requests) and a DJ afterwards that played a surprisingly vast array of music. Old-school hip-hop and R&B, Top 40, and even a small Latin set. Crowds seemed to be good, not \"Japanese-subway\" crowded, but enough people to make it seem like you shouldn't regret your decision to dance.  Really, I love this place, and have made it a point to visit Carnaval Court whenever I come to Vegas. Just leave your ego (and your dress shoes) at the door and have a damn good time.",

Being a bartender, i let you in on a secret... on your first drink introduce yourself, tip FAT (not just the standard $1, you ARE showing your appreciation  for entertainment too), get to know your bartenders and you may get hooked up with a double, free drinks or shots.  this is where flair is at its finest. the bartenders are friendly, the live music is good and the atmosphere is awesome.

It's a great day-drinking place.  They switch off between a live band and DJ throughout the day and the bands are typically spoof bands that are always fun.  They even keep the dance floor area clear during the day if you are feeling the music.  At night, I believe they start charging cover for everyone at 9pm and its $5-10.  The line can get pretty long at times once they start checking ID and charging.  I have been there several times and their dance floor never gets too packed at night, or at least it doesn't seem to but the open air may help make it not seem so cramped.  They have a lot of open seating along w/ reserved tables, if you want table its best to get there by like 8:30-9:30 I would say.  The bartenders alone are worth checking this place out.  They have fun with everyone and its not everyday you can see bottle of liquor being flipped through the air and fires being randomly set to special drinks.  Their tall yard drinks are delish (I recommend their special lemonade!) and are $27 and will get you good and drunk vs paying $10 for 3-4 smaller drinks.  One annoyance factor is there are no restrooms in the actual bar, you have to leave the bar and go into Harrahs Casino.  Usually the doorman remembers you when you return at night but I've been carded again when trying to get back in.  But super fun place and is a staple of Vegas!",

We showed up pretty early, like around 6:30pm, and stayed till 1am, if somewhere keeps you there THAT long then it has to be fabulous right?! RIGHT!!!!! All of my drinks were made to perfection and the bartenders were great at keeping us entertained with the tossing and twirling of the liquor that was soon to be in my mouth. Also (since it was my birthday) each of them (there were 5) came over and poured a shot of yummyness in my mouth. Needless to say I was hammered and having a blast! There was a band playing fun oldies and we danced our little footsies off bar side...eff the dance floor ha ha!  I HIGHLY recommend Carnival....even though I kept calling it the Circle Bar",

We had a group of 14 people and so wanted to ensure we had a good place to hang out to celebrate my 30th.  A month before our arrival, I called daily for a week to try and reach someone at the bar to see about making this reservation. Finally after calling in the evening instead, I got a hold of a manager who was very helpful. I learned prices and made the reservation and understood that this manager would be on duty that night. I even got my email confirmation and so we were set.  So we show up this past Friday at 10pm on the dot, just to have the same manager tell us to our faces that he has no idea who we are and that we don't have a reservation. I was furious. We were seated anyways as the VIP area was empty. We got one bottle that was higher priced than I was quoted and had spotty service. We decided after the one bottle to leave as service was junk and our group wasn't having fun. I was then told there would be a two bottle minimum to stay in our seats, which was also never discussed.  While this bar is enjoyable and the band is always good, I was very disappointed with the level of service we received. Apparently reservations mean nothing and $215 for a bottle of vodka is a ridiculous.",

The bartenders are sooooo entertaining and as I was by myself they made sure I had a good time. I love them all! Gotta give a shout out to Ati though, she was amazzzzzzing! I had a creeper talking to me and my coldness obviously wasn't getting through to him so Ati stepped in, made a barrier with shaker tins and would whistle at him every time he tried to talk to me! Lol!! Love that! I'm always going to go out of my way to party at carnival court every time I go to Vegas now. It's so much better than those clubs everyone dies to go to. Great music also. First night was a dj, then second night was a great cover band! Drinks are a bit pricey, but they free pour and I'm always feeling pretty damn good after bout 3 jack and cokes so thank u!",

For $10 you can get a mighty strong drink, and between $30-50 you can get the 1.5-3ft souvenir cups.  I handed my friend one of the 3ft-ish purple ones for his 21st birthday...and he lost 7 hours of his life (and a pain to take care of, but we're not reviewing him).  You don't even need to know what to drink, just tell the bartender what flavors you're feeling like and they'll whip you up something AMAZING.  My *first* there was Vache, whom I saw for the first time 4 years ago, and was still there last week.    Live band, crazy antics like juggling flaming bottles or balancing giant stacks of bottles (see photos), giving shots with whipped cream shaped penises (also see photos), random pouring free shots directly into people's mouths...3-4 hours here will fly like time has never flown before.",

This place is outside and it was cold and very windy, we had warm seats at the bar and we had bags and stuff with us. So, we just got up and danced right there next to our seats.  Later \"Mr. Smith\" came up to us and said they could see that we were having a good time dancing. We will be coming here next time we are in town.",

There was nothing and no one in there that justified walking in the gate. I lingered for a minute and then walked on. Compared to Austin, at this point it's kinda Austin 80: Vegas 5 (and that too mostly just for the Vegas lights, the waterfalls, and the best restrooms). (Austin's not perfect either, but it whups Vegas ass in terms of hopping bars with pretty local girls who often took me back home.)",

Bartenders are awesome and entertaining.  Reminds me of Tom Cruise in the movie \"Cocktail.\" Seriously these bartenders have talent. Oh and this place has a few blackjack tables which is a plus for my BF since he loves to gamble. The DJ was awesome and played a lot of old school as well as some new school songs.  This is great place to hang out, dance, and get your drink on. If you just looking to have fun and want to avoid the pain in waiting in line at the hottest clubs in Vegas, this is the place to go for a much different vibe.",

Like I literally dropped it on the ground at some point.   My favorite thing about this place has to be the fact it's not filled with a bunch of pretentious dbags. The age of the crowd is pretty varied. There was this old dude up front going all out who must have been in his 70s. But the average is probably 30.   I was stuck with a hotel reservation alone since my friend got sick, so I hit this place up a few times and didn't feel uncomfortable chatting with people or dancing (though I was quite a few drinks in at that point).   The drinks aren't cheap (avg $12), but they make them strong. The bartenders are chill and fun to talk with and watch them do the flair thing.  Out of the many times I've been, last night was the first time I've seen a cover. Usually it's free. But on a crowded Friday night I think it's necessary. It was only $10.   Also I like that they have blackjack tables inside!   It doesn't really get busy until 11pm. It was still going pretty hard on a Thursday at 4am.   Knocking off stars for: -No outside drinks  -Security guards have an attitude   PS: If you found my $100 bill please message me :)",

Don't ask me why, but maybe because I was a little looser in the limbs from walking so much AND I wasn't preoccupied with my 6:30am flight home to Burbank. Which, note to self, never do again.   We had beers, one round ordered by me, the next by a couple who just silently sheered us. I love this place quite a bit, and more so each time I go.",

They're super talented so get ready for some awesome tricks and free liquor being poured down your throat.

The ONLY reason I didn't give the 5th star is because I'm a cheap person, so I didn't like paying $12 for a gin and tonic... but I'm sure most people are use to that.

They work very hard to entertain each and every person at the bar and all seem to be having fun themselves in the process.  I don't recall the cost of the drinks here as I am usually pretty toasty by the time I leave, but they must be pretty comparable to other Vegas spots or I think I would remember one way or the other.  The music is fun and loud.  Sometimes there is a comedian...fairly funny...gets funnier as you drink!!!  If you get bored there are tables around the bar where you can play.  I would recommend Carnaval Court to anyone just looking to have some lowkey daytime Vegas fun.  Also a great option for those of you who don't like doing the daytime Vegas pool thang.  I am a PALE white casper type and avoid the sun whenever possible...this bar is perfectly shaded so I am able to get some \"safe\" outside Vegas fun, too!!!",

The people in here: college kids who don't know any better, older folk who wouldn't/couldn't go to a hipper/nicer club or bar, drunk people who have lost their money, friends, or both, generally clueless wide-eyed tourists from small towns on their first trip to Vegas.  I did not see any flair bartending happening - I didn't see any bussing/cleaning happening - I did not see any good service or atmosphere happening.  I did see really old ex-stripper type women being grinded on by college guys.  I did see random drunk people meet and start sucking face within minutes.

It's a great place to hang out when it's too hot to do anything else, and you just want to sit back and enjoy a drink with some live music.     They are known for their flair bartenders at Carnaval Court.  Now, what's flair bartending?  It's pretty much bartenders entertaining guests with the use of bar tools and liquor bottles.  It's become a competitive sport that's featured on Food Network TV nowadays.  And some of the best come from Harrah's!  Be sure to tip these talented bartenders because more tricks will keep on coming as long as you keep them happy!    I usually grab a seat in front of the stage so I can listen to the live bands play some popular cover songs.  And life isn't too bad when the band has cute musicians to keep you watching!  At some point, you'll find people getting up to dance along, which is always much more entertaining.    Feel free to grab a bite from their Grill type menu.  I've only had the nachos myself, so I can't vouch for any of the other food on the menu.  During the day, there's no cover charge, but that changes as the sun drops.  It gets a lot more crowded in front of the bar and casino tables open up on weekend nights.  It's a casual place which is a nice contrast to the ever present dress code restrictions of most rocking places in Vegas.  They are open from 1 pm to 2 am and their food prices range from $15 and up.  So, swing on by Harrah's Carnaval Court and watch some serious flair bartending going on while listening to some jamming music!  We like entertainment like this!",

The bartenders are always on point and are so fun to watch, and the drinks are stiff every time - they definitely don't skimp on the booze! They also have live music much of the time and a large area by the stage to dance. When there hasn't been a band they still have great music playing to get you in the party mood. The atmosphere here cannot be beat - I highly, highly, HIGHLY recommend making a stop here next time (and every time!) you're in Vegas!!!",

The bouncers let us in without waiting in line, and we tried to shoot the gap and skip cover but the cashier had eyes in the back of his head.  I bought an Adios Motherf*cker, and that pretty much sums up the rest of the night.  I should have said adios to my cell phone, which disappeared somewhere in the bowels of a casino.  There was a live cover band and we danced for a while, but the True entertainment for me was up at the bar.  The little asian bartender was shameless, and helped pretty girls get intoxicated in just about every suggestive way possible.  For instance, when my friend turned her head and got Malibu all over her face during a shot-pour, he wiped her face on his towel... in his crotch.  Don't come here if you're easily embarassed/offended, but I had a blast.  Thanks to yelper Myke R. for hookups with the free beverages!",

Yes, I've had way too many (just one time, really) but it was a Hoot and a Half!!  The myriad of bottles and mixers spinning and flying through the air keep you mesmerized...cause you just know they are going to drop those things!  They dont.  Not too long ago one of the Food Network or Travel type channels showed a Flair Bartender competition...and lo and behold there was our fav, Flippy.  He didn't win, but it was almost as entertaining from our couch to watch...ok I'm lying, but sounded good  :)  The entire bar is one big circle and at one point, for a buck (yep $1) the bartenders walk the top of the bar and mix a \"special\" drink right into your waiting gullet.  Yeah, there's the yard o' beer, yard o' margarita...dot dot dot, but go with something you can enjoy and stay away from the frozen drinks  as you don't need a brain freeze on top of everything else.  There is a stage behind the bar area and usually there is a full on live performance happening....great tunes and a good compliment to the activity at the bar.  Salut!",

Personally, I'd rather you just pour me a damn drink and enough with the flair bartending. But I did come across an Asian bartender who poured a good shot of Patron for me so I went back there a second night and stood right in front of him for most of the night.  Lots of eye candy.

    "text": "Carnaval Court would have gotten 4 or 5 stars from me.  However, terrible customer service dropped my rating REALLY fast.    We came here after our wedding reception on June 22nd.  Most of our guests joined us.  In total, we had about 25 people.  When we got there, they let us sit in their new section with all the couches.  This was at about 5:30 p.m.  We were having a great time.  Dancing to the bands, ordering countless buckets of beer and mixed drinks.    Around 10 p.m. (after we had spent hundreds and hundreds of dollars on alcohol here), security came to kick us out because they use that area for bottle service at this time.  This is where my issue comes in.  I know how bottle service works in Vegas, so I had no problem moving.  It was the way they treated us that bothered me.  After we spent the last 4 1/2 hours there, security came to kick us out very rudely.  They were rude to all of my guests.  They said we never should have been sitting there in the first place.  That's funny - why did no one mention that to us earlier and why were their waitresses serving us drinks up there with no issues?  One of my guests works in hotel management and he tried to speak to two different people to fix the situation.  Both of them basically ignored him.  One security person wouldn't let me back up in the area to let me help my guests move their things.  I told her they were my wedding guests and I was trying to help move things faster, but she blocked me from going up the stairs.  This could have been handled totally differently.  All they had to say was, hey, this area is for bottle service after 10 p.m., we will accommodate you somewhere else.  We'll help you move your things.  DONE!  They just didn't seem to care about how much money we had spent there. Even if we hadn't, why would you treat people at your business like that?  I was not a fan.  Sorry Carnaval Court.  I would have loved to spend the rest of my evening there, but me and my 25 guests decided to celebrate somewhere else.",

Recommended by others that had been there before us, we went the first time knowing it would be decent.  The first time, we had a fairly large group.  The place itself was not necessarily packed and getting a seat at the bar was easy.  We had fun chatting up the bar tenders as they threw around the bottles Cocktail style while we listened to a lot of our favorite music being performed by the cover band.  We had such a good time that we made a point to stop by on our 2nd trip to the strip.  This time was far busier but we managed to have a good time, chat up some Brits and get a good buzz before heading to the next venue.",

There are just so many different types of stimuli to keep you entertained for hours. First, the bartenders..I get stoked when I catch a football...These guys, toss a cherry in the air, while balancing 9. hundred bottles on their heads, and catch it on the toothpick they are holding in their mouths. Also, they are super friendly and interactive w/out seeming fake. Steve is the man. The crowd varies BIG TIME. There is a little bit of everyone, frat boys, familes (adults of course), Military, prepsters, 909ers. Everyones there to party so you wont be catchin attitude from anyone. The live band during the day is awesome (wonderboogie?), they always host the booty shaking contest which is guaranteed flashing of some T&A to you boys out there. The drinks are about par for Vegas. I suggest your order the rum runner. You'll only need 1.5, best bang for your buck. After a couple of those get your butt up to the dance floor at the front of stage, make and ass of yourself, then call it an afternoon. i've had their lunch combo here. Something like $7 for a hot dog, chips and a drink. Not great but not bad, i'd get it again. It was filling.",

I have never had a bad experience here and it is cheaper to drink here compared to the other clubs and you have just as much fun! The one thing that puts this place over all the other clubs is that there are places you can sit without the bouncer coming and telling you to get off the couches unless you have bottle service and they have a casual dress code!

These bartenders were doing some of the craziest tricks and playing with the crowd every so often all we heard was \"free shots\" The bartender would go around giving Free shots it was so much fun... i was there for a good while i didn't want to leave mainly because i couldn't stand up lol but the crown was giving these guys like 100 dollars tips they would ring the cow bell and here we go again \"free shots\" and all this happened at like 12 in the afternoon i cant imagine the madness at night....enjoy.",

The Tom Cruise cocktail wannabe bartender was low-rent and tried to pull a no look over the head bottle thing and broke it all over the floor  so that pretty much made my day.  Other than that unless your looking for a case of the clap avoid the women in this joint they look a bit sketchy.",
