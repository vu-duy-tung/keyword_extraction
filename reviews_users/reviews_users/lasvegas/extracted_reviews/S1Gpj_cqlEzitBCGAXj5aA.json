However, they just started managing this place, so maybe there are good things to come...we shall see.",

We weren't told that we'd be charged extra for things like rice and bread, even though the server kept bringing us more. I'm not sure how much each side of rice was, but it was really expensive and they didn't bring us a complimentary portion for our entrees. The portions were tiny. Think Happy Meal tiny. This wouldn't be a problem if the prices weren't so high. All in all, I won't be back, but I'll be looking for another restaurant that has good food, good portions, good prices, and good service. 2 stars just for the food.",

My favorite is during the lunch buffet, the price is very reasonable and very tasty(even better with 10% off coupon which you can find it on magazine all the time), my Indian neighbor also told me not only they think the food are great, the restaurant never charge their 5 and 4 year old kids, my india friends from CA also loves the food there.  The dinner was a bit more expensive, but well worth it, they have combination dishes that you can get for $16, which include appetizers, 2 course entree, dessert and drinks, I felt just right after I finish it, and the services were good.  Although Origin India has better review, but I've been there just twice and hate their service already(please refer to the one about coupon), trust me, I would rather go to a friendly restaurant where I feel welcome than going to a restaurant with great food but got insulted by the waiters.  here's my review to Origin India, if you want to have great food but in a mood of being insulted, here's the best place to go <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/origin-india-las-vegas#hrid:lzQO_2nU2Y2CFCXWEZf1rQ\">yelp.com/biz/origin-indi...</a>",

I have dined at many desi restaurants here. This is my second review of Gandhi. Last time I gave a 3 star not because their food was not good but because of other reasons. but now they deserve better rating. The lamb curry is fantastic (my all time favorite) & so was the chicken tikka masala.  My wife loves the malai kofta & so did I. We love their rice & dal fry too. And no, they don't use plastic ware or paper cups for buffet anymore. I have dined in many Indian restaurants all throughout the US & I think Gandhi is one of my favorite North Indian restaurant. Their Indian buffet definitely ranks in top 3 in the US. Good job team!!",

I was politely greeted at the entrance by the staff, and was asked which kind of seating I prefer. Obviously I picked the booth. The booths were extremely comfortable and spacious. The lighting of the restaurant made it extremely relaxing.  I proceeded to the drinks menu, which had a good variety of spirits & most importantly for me...a few solid craft beers (rare for an Indian restaurant). We ordered the chicken tikka as an appetizer, and for dinner the daal, butter chicken, and methi chicken. We got a few orders of butter naan to go with the entrees. All of the food was delicious, and was definitely authentic indian (I'm indian so I would know). Overall I'm extremely satisfied with this place. I definitely recommend going here if you want quality authentic Indian food in a setting of friendly staff, nice ambience, and a real India feel.",

I just don't really know what else to say. This place was just average I guess. I was there for the lunch buffet and to repeat Misti Y., it did seem like for what they offered combined with freshness level, it was a tad pricey. I did think the food tasted really good, and I liked the vegetarian dishes and both dessert options. They had a carrot/raisin pudding and a sweet rice noodle/coconut pudding. Mixed together, it was so friggin' GOOD!   Now here's the major bummer. One of my favorite things is Indian \"Nan\" bread. I was NOT feein' this place's nan (at least, not on the buffet). It's supposed to be somewhat fluffy and soft. This place's nan seemed like it had sat out too long or something, because it was flat and pretty hard in places. It was disappointing, because it is meant to be ripped up and used to scoop up the yummy rice and curry mix with your hands. I couldn't even rip off a piece anywhere without getting a hard, unbend-able hunk of bread.  I was recommended to try the Kingfisher beer, which apparently is a popular beer consumed in India. It's a light beer, but has a bitter, hoppy kick to it.. Unfortunately, I had to flag down a waiter just to order it.  They sat us down, and just left. My mom wanted to go up and get a plate immediately, but I told her to wait a few minutes because at a buffet, they are supposed to come over and ask what you want to drink. No one ever came. We just sat there staring at each other for five minutes while waiting for someone to stop by the table, to no avail. Kinda odd.  Maybe I will come back for dinner, but I feel like I could find an Indian restaurant just as good (if not better) for less money. For two lunch buffets and a beer, the bill was like $34! Holy S*IT!   One positive: If you go on their website, you can print out a 15% coupon! You will need it with those prices.",

    "text": "What I remember most about Gandhi: the surprising interior and the tad expensive price tag on the lunch buffet (and my charming lunch companion). The buffet was large with plenty of vegetarian selections, and the food was good. I thought the flavors were tempting; they led me back for a second plate, but the vegetables were a tad overcooked, and hence, some things did not appear to be the freshest. Overall, I enjoyed my lunch, but when I find myself thinking about the interior and cost, I know that the food was not mind-blowingly delicious. At $12 the price is not the best value for Indian buffet, which is always a consideration for me. (The star rating is largely a reflection of the price.) Plus, since visiting Gandhi, I have revisited my go-to Indian buffet to confirm my taste buds preference.  The interior is quite impressive, a remodel since the days of the overhead carpet, and a stark contrast to the exterior surroundings. There are private rooms in the back, and I could see hosting a small private dinner here, as the restaurant feels spacious and nice.   However, this may be the last time I stray from my tried and True all time fave Indian buffet in Vegas, as I think my taste buds might run away if I try to take them anywhere else!",

Then you turn the corner and see a beautiful restaurant-- not what you'd expect.  The ceilings are high, the tables have high backs so you have a little more privacy, there are rooms that have curtains that can be drawn, and it's dimly lit.  The food is very good and the prices are reasonable and can't compare to anything on the strip.",

If you don't know where this place is, chances are you probably won't find it as it is hidden within a strip mall and you would think it was closed down if you didn't know any better.  We were seated immediately as it appeared that my friend knew everyone in the place. Everyone made sure to come over and say hello and to constantly check on us all evening. I actually felt like a celebrity with all the attention we were getting. Anyway enough about that, onto the food.  We ordered the Paneer Pakora which was homemade deep fried cottage cheese, Gosht Vindaloo, and the Chicken Makhanwala along with tons of Nan. I was in Indian food heaven. The lamb was cooked to perfection and the Chicken had a nice blend of spices and the sauce was divine! I am sitting here licking my lips still remembering just how good it was.   This place is a nice little hidden gem that you should really try if you are ever in Vegas. You do realize that it means you will have to explore outside of the strip so venture if you dare :)",

Don't get me wrong, I am sure there are people who prefer the wide spread buffets at the casinos, but this one is no less.   The food is well cooked and the arrangement is nice. The price is, if I still remember, $10...all you can eat. Isn't that sweet? Its about a mile or so from the strip in a strip mall.   Enjoy!!!",

We picked up our order, went back to the hotel, and then had to go all the way back to pick up rice so we could eat. What kind of Indian place doesn't give you rice with your entrees?

After asking the lady, she explained you can either do the buffet or order off the menu.   I decided to stay because there were so many people there.......the food was so good. So good that I went back for dinner the same night. For dinner I ordered off the menu (there is no buffet at night anyways.) and I cannot believe the results.   The food off the menu was even better than the buffet (which was already some of the best Indian food I've had.) I will be eating here every chance I get every time i'm in vegas.

Decor: rich dark colors, very spacious rooms. Food: EXCELLENT! Papadom (compliments of the chef). Light crispy, not overly spicy. For starters we ordered Paneer Pakora. Very good seasoned excellent appetizer. Mulligantawny soup. Be prepared to unusual preparation, not what  you would expect, but very good.  Entries: Chicken Tikka Masala OMG!! Best Tikka Masala I ever had Fish Korma. This dish is not on a menu, but I asked if it would be possible to prepare it for us. That's another big STAR to Gandhi restaurant. Every our request was  accommodated. They try to make your dinner a real \"experience\". Which gives a great feeling of being taken care of.    Back to entries Eggplant Bharta. We asked to make it mild. Well.. you can not really make this dish mild it is meant to be spicy..But hey managed. Funny.. mild on a beginning it gives you a \"kick\"  a couple of sends later. We actually asked to make another one like it, so we can take it home! Naan. Excellent. Another item we ordered more for take out, we enjoyed later.  Prices: Surprisingly inexpensive. The portions are quite big. We ordered Mango Lassie, which was twice the size of any lassie we had before, price however was $3.50?  I almost was ready to say to our waiter that this is to cheap, and they should raise the price (but, of course I  did not say anything)  Overall great restaurant. If you get a chance stop here and you won't regret it.",

Back in college, my buddies and I would always swing by Gandhi India Cuisine at the end of each visit to Vegas. Nothing cures a hang over like nice buttery, saucy, and oiling Indian food :). It really isn't that disgusting when eating it.   Brian from Family Guy describes Indian food as...(Brian is so hungry he eats Stewie's diaper.) \"Hey, at least its better than Indian food.\" That's exactly how I feel. Indian food quality is always hit or miss. If you cannot stomach \"ethnic\" foods, I don't recommend trying Indian food, but if you have a taste for adventure and have a strong stomach then try it. I love garlic Naan and curry chicken. There are a lot of other items and sauces that I'm not sure what they are, but they taste delicious. Be warned you will have a food coma after your Gandhi experience.   The restaurant is family owned and servers make you feel at home. I went a few times with Indian friends to help explain what everything is to me. This place is hard to find. It is near Terrible casino and behind a Morton's Steakhouse restaurant I think...near a massage parlor just off the strip. I think the way I first discovered this place was through a coupon in a Las Vegas magazine. My friends were semi-serious about going. It was a very hot day and our car broke down right in the same plaza. Call it fate or luck. I don't believe in luck. In Vegas, its ALL SKILL.",

Don't walk in and expect biriyani r any south indian style food. Bad ambiance and time in filling buffet items. Strongly recommend to stay away from this place if you like to have tasty & and good South Indian buffet.",

    "text": "[Review is for the lunch buffet]  Not the best buffet in Vegas and not the cheapest (running about $12.95), but you can expect some good spice from the buffet options.  What sets Gandhi India Cuisine's buffet aside from other Indian buffets in Vegas is the surprising spice.  The general tendency in an Indian buffet is to keep it bland.  The buffet has to make a lot of different palates happy and the general tendency is to keep it bland to make the most folks happy.  But cheers to Gandhi for not skimping on the spice.    They usually have several vegetarian options in the buffet and a number of delicious chicken dishes.  There's some real hit and miss going on with the dishes.  I loved the paneer in spicy butter cream and the chicken tikka masala.  And thumbs up for the naan and the okra dish.    That said, many of the dishes simply fall flat.  Problem is, at $12.95, this is one of the more expensive non-strip buffets and it is simply just not spectactular.",

I walked in through that door  and waited to be seated in side the resturant   The TV was blareing and after waiting 5 minnutes we finnaly were seated in an empty resturant with the exception of a large group of men sitting in a corner table staring at us.. There were dirty tables that had not be bussed and when the waiter came over with water to pour inside a dirty glass I stoped him and said..Thanks but No Thanks we are leaving..He asked if the prices are too high I replied I didnt even bother to look at the menu sorry and got up and left.y",

The tandoori chicken was really tender and full of flavor. It was all hot and fresh and really good. A few dishes were a little spicy for me. But the naan was perfect. Customer service wasn't too bad, although they could use a little pep up. Perfect lunch to keep my energy going while we explored the Strip and went to see the fountains. I love Indian food because it sustains my energy for a long time. The place was super nice. I was impressed with how fancy it felt, but the lunch buffet was still an extremely inexpensive amount, especially coming from Hawaii where everything costs an arm and a leg. Thank you for a nice lunch and keep that buffet because I will visit every time I come back!",

We were there for holiday and so the restaurant was strictly buffet, which the owner said is not usually the case. The assortment of foods was the best I've seen on any buffet. Plenty of options for meat eaters and vegetarians alike. Everyone was friendly, in fact in some cases they were a little too on top of their game. Perhaps checking in on us a little too much.       We knew from the moment we walked in a saw the place packed that we were at the right spot. I will be back there and only wished I lived closer.",

The atmosphere is authentic and I loved the Indian music videos playing in the back ground.  The customer service is superb and they make you feel welcome as soon as you enter.  You must try the butter chicken - it was a hit with everyone a the table.  I am vegetarian, so my nephew ordered the sauce that goes on top for my naan.  I personally recommend the vegetable Biriyani.  Bon appetite!",

Large pieces of butter were still floating in the dishes when brought to the table. Even the plain white rice had too much butter. Overall, a tasteless and unhealthy dinner that spoiled our evening.

When we were waiting to be seated one of the staff members came to tell us they were closing. It's 2:30 in the afternoon why would they be closing early on a Saturday? Also, their website states they close at 11 pm so that was really weird. I had to look down to see the color of my skin to figure out why they were all of a sudden closing so early. But that's okay, I would much rather give my hard earned money to a company that respect and values their customers regardless of  what race they are. I drove about a mile up the street to another restaurant called India Oven Masala. I had no issues there. Their food was great and their service was awesome as well. So I will definitely recommend going to that restaurant instead.",

Well, their proximity to my hotel and the lack of good Indian food where I live allowed me to make a very trepidatious visit.  Sadly, not worth it.  The food was very much on the bland side, service was amateur, and when I presented them the Yelp 10% discount, they requested that I give them a positive review.  Well, here's your review guys.   Other things of note, the restaurant was nearly empty on a Saturday night at 7pm, and the restrooms could have been cleaner.  Fortunately, I saw no evidence of roaches in my palak paneer, but I certainly paused to wonder if they might have inadvertently been serving a few cockroach curries that evening.

I wanted Indian food and wanted to go to an Indian place after a twelve hour shift tonight that wasn't regular wanted to be in a romantic setting AND have VERY tasty food at the same time. I've eaten Indian food for only about 7 years now. Not very long. Every. Single. Time. I've gotten chicken tikka masala and yes I'll say it was good. And for Gandhi I was expecting the same reaction. But tonight. Me and my boyfriend come to this spot, & it was very quiet and hidden, come in and dine in a completely eye opening experience. I ACTUALLY WAS SURPRISED FROM BEGINNING TO END. the food is so flavorful yet so simplistic. You don't ask questions. You get off of a twelve hour shift step away and experience what these beautiful workers are going to feed you I love it. On top of that we got let's just say a \"kind gesture\" (but see for yourself to see what that is) from who appeared to be the manager because they recently re-opened in June! This worker let us know the restaurant re-renovated their entire kitchen in May 2018. Also that they were and are the very first Indian restaurant in Vegas opening at as early as 1993!!!!! I was -2 at the time. (Eye opening much??? Um......This is my place for life now no  questions....) they also have had the same chef SINCE. That says BIG things because I haven't had to die for (like LA) Indian food yet. And mind you I've tried multiple places. Lived here two years now. This place is not a miracle. NO. It's just a GREAT PLACE with GREAT FOOD. GREAT ATMOSPHERE. GREAT PEOPLE. GREAT PRICES UNLIKE THESE OTHER PLACES. basically it's a place that backs their sh** up  if I leave a restaurant feeling nostalgia....... THAT MEANS SOMETHING YOU GUYS DESERVE THIS REVIEW. There's only so many places I eat at and leave but can't stop reminiscing to. Seriously not many. you guys are MY hidden gem.",

    "text": "TL;DR: adequate food best served at a rarely-used regional airport.  We've been looking forward to going to this restaurant for a long time, so we had high expectations for the dinner.  How to quantify he disappointment? Well, imagine being told that you were going to meet a great Indian leader named Gandhi, only to find that it was Sonia, Indira's son's wife, not the Mahatma. Sure, it would be neat to meet the president of the Congress Party, but, still.  We chose two dishes: chicken korma and lamb biryani.  The korma was passable in a pinch, but the biryani was a disaster.  Biryani is supposed to have delectable pieces of meat, slowly cooked to a tender, savory consistency. The lamb in this dish tasted and felt as though it was re-used from a prior day (or recycled from the lunch buffet); tough, slightly dry, and almost flavorless.  Regarding the korma, in our experience korma has a very rich and savory taste, almost buttery, that fills the mouth. This dish was ok, but had a slightly greasy aftertaste. The gravy (if that's the right term) was thin and only vaguely flavorful.  Also, and this may be a small issue, but why separate charges for the oily jasmine rice?  Ambiance: we were assaulted by what I can only term \"Indian Booty Music\" when we entered the establishment. We're familiar with Bollywood-style music and music videos; what was playing, however, was some mixture of Beyonce's Lemonade and Brittany Spear's snake dance and Indian music.  It was loud and obnoxious, but it was turned down quite a bit after we entered.  The decorating was done as an homage to the second Matrix movie.  We were the first guests of the evening, and only two couples arrived while we were there.  Perhaps it's the location (next to a series disgusting small shops), but the entire joint has a slightly seedy vibe, and maybe that's what's causing the problems the owners clearly are having with this place.",

I dont know what is in most dishes, but thats not important if the grub is smack good!  ...I know one of my faves is Chicken Masala. They have a selective buffet from 12pm - 2pm for $11.95 which is a great option for those who want to dib and dab here and there to see if this kind of cuisine is your thing.  The interior is exotic and the music is indian pop which all adds to the dining experience.  When you come in, ask for a server named  Megiddo, i swear he is Ghandi reincarnated!",

Then I drove down Paradise Road and saw a sign that read Gandhi.   I remembered the concept of ahimsa all of a sudden, took a deep breath, and figured that the food gods were on my side.  I walked inside and saw meat on the plates of other patrons.  I was mildly annoyed since Gandhi was a vegetarian and I normally would have been a pain in the ass about it, but I was so desperate for food that I was willing to sacrifice my principles for the good of my stomach.  I asked the server if there were a few vegetarian dishes present at the buffet, and he smiled and proceeded to show me the goods.  After correctly guessing that I am from California (a vegetarian twenty-something with a serious sense of entitlement, where else could I be from?) I proceeded to eat this excellent, varied, and overpriced lunch, surrounded by friendly staff who were attentive but not overbearing.  I had such a great meal that I made my friends go there with me again the next day.  I highly recommend this place to vegetarian tourists.",

Plenty of vegeterian options, and they have enough variety that it's rarely same combination of dishes.  They really won me over with their okra dish... Magnificient!  Muah!  That's what sticks out in my head the most, so I guess the rest is good but not necessarily spectactular.  It is in a somewhat seedy strip mall, but heck, some of Vegas' greats share that characteristic, Lotus of Siam anyone?  Interior decor I find quite pleasing.  The lunch buffet will run you around $12.50, so middle of the road pricewise, too.  I think this belong on your list if you're racking up your checklist of Vegas' Indian buffets.",

We ordered couple of plates of lamb biryani and it did not taste like biryani and tasted like yellow rice turned white and some meat tossed in it. The serves were also very small for the price we paid. We spent over $100 and it was not its value from a quality and service perspective.  Hope we received better service and quality Indian food.",

The food was very delicious, the waiters were constantly making sure we had enough water, were satisfied with our food, and were otherwise taken care of.  The decoration of the place is cool, too - definitely not what you'd expect looking at it from the outside.  And, for all you vegetarians/vegans, there's plenty to eat here - and though I can't remember what dish I had (the waiter picked it out for me), it was SO good!  Definitely a spot I'll come back to.",

I am relatively new to Indian food, and my friend told me I had to try this hidden gem.    The restaurant itself is squeezed behind an Albertsons (next to a wig shop) but don't let that deter you!  Inside is very nice, and open.  Everything I had on the buffet was delicious (and I tried a little bit of almost everything!) and the servers kept our water glasses full and our table clear of abandoned plates.  I would definitely recommend this to others, and I will return (if only for the tikka masala...omg so delicious).  My friend told me that regionally, this restaurant favored the northern styles of cooking and most of the others nearby are more southern in orientation.  So keep that in mind if this is not entirely what you expected.  I found everything to be delicious.  I've been stuffed for hours. Give it a shot.  :)",

I love eating food from a places that has exotic and authentic cruisines.   I also love the Indian beer as well.  Forgot the name of the beer but it was very good.",

Besides being very bland there was a serious issue of meat!!! There was almost none, just a little bit of chicken in their dishes, and the tandoori chicken left a lot to be disired. Thats it, no beef somosas or lamb or goat!  This was my second time here, the first was 10yrs ago, sadly the place hasn't improved...",

There is a WOW factor here that doesn't seem to exist in the other India restaurants I've eaten.  The lunch buffet had something for everyone from vegetarians to meat and fish eaters. The Butter Makhanwala Chicken was perfectly spiced.  The Ponjobi Curry took me back to my Far East travels and the Naan bread was light and buttery.  The atmosphere is comfy with large private booths that can comfortably seat 8 to 10.  If you have never been here, or haven't been since their new renovations in May, now is the time to check it out before the word gets out and you'll be having to make reservations to take your turn.",

The batter also didn't coat the paneer cubes well leaving lot of raw paneer taste in mouth. The kadhai paneer wasn't authentic and tasted more like paneer cooked with a Chinese style sweet and sour sauce.",

    "text": "Dined at Gandhi for the first time in quite a while to use a groupon. I remember dining at Gandhi many years ago and it was not my favorite Indian place in town, but I figured we would give it another try. We liked the interior a lot. Very high ceilings, roomy and it was nice and chilly inside, which was nice on a super hot summer evening. We were sat right away and the host greeted us with a \"hello sir\", no acknowledgment of my female guest, but other than that he was pleasant and accommodating. The person who came to take out order approached us and we weren't sure if he worked there or not because he was just in regular street clothes and stood there for a moment without saying anything. He seemed very tired or maybe stoned, which was kind of funny, but it made for an awkward experience. He also only acknowledged me. We placed our order and he tried to talk us into a couple of other things, fair enough. He asked if we wanted the naan bread with butter or not, which I have never been asked before while eating Indian food. I said no thanks, just bring it out how it normally comes. The vegetable samosas and vegetable pakoras were awesome. For our main course we shared mushroom mutter and saag paneer with naan bread and rice. The main dishes were crazy buttery. I mean, the main flavor we could taste was butter. I like butter, but when that is the main flavor that we are tasting, something isn't quite right. Also, the naan bread had butter, which I did not ask for. We were checked on several times by the host and the server and again and again they never acknowledged my female guest. I guess when they ask \"how is everything sir\" they only care about me and not her.   3 stars isn't a terrible score, because this place isn't terrible, it's just ok. The service is a bit awkward and the food was decent, but not my favorite here in LV. A couple of suggestions 1) Maybe the servers should introduce themselves as the person that will be taking the guests order 2) Acknowledge all of the guests at the table \"hi, how are you two doing?\" And not just the male 3) Pull back a bit on the butter.",

We went in because I caught sight of it out of the corner of my eye while driving by and hadn't heard of it. That should have been a warning sign but instead I took it as an opportunity. Unfortunately, this spot was very disappointing: overpriced and subpar.  Interior is well decorated and the high ceilings are nice, unexpectedly nice considering the strip-mall exterior. Menu prices are a bit high with most dishes ~$20. This would be okay if portions were larger or if rice was included, as at most Indian restaurants.   We ordered the goat curry, saag paneer, and garlic naan- all dishes we love and get regularly. The goat was among the toughest I've ever had, the paneer was flavorless, and even the naan was rather lacking. Dishes were brought out in small bowls without rice, which was not offered or mentioned in any way to indicate that it was not included, and had to be requested. Our bill was about $50 for mediocrity, but they do offer a 10% off Yelp check-in discount.",

I went into this expecting not to like it and was so pleasantly surprised to find out, I actually quite liked it! Would recommend this place to anyone. P.S. The buttered chicken curry is literally heaven in your mouth. Enjoy!",

If you happen to eat at this dump that's decorated to be some type of indian EDM dance club, you will probably end up like Ghandi and want to fast for the next several days. The one and only waiter was so big and tough looking and acting that it seemed like he should have been a Sultan's bodyguard instead of in the customer service business. What I want to say is that this guy is the world's worst waiter but is so intimidating that I wouldn't dare complain about it (to his face). Their prices are too high for low quality food. We ordered two very different dishes and they tasted almost identically the same. I hate this fucking place. I hope their tandoori oven melts this papadum shack off the face of the earth. Fuck you!",

When a buffet costs $14-15, you would think they would invest in cutlery. Nope. although the plates are ceramic(very light), the cups are 'take-out' material cups and the spoons look metallic but they are 'faux' metal spoons. The fork bent while cutting into my idli, haha. Come on guys, invest a bit more.   Will be back.",

Service was great, the food was amazing, and I swore an oath to myself that I would somehow come back here.  I was in Vegas with my fiance this past weekend and, even though he's not big on Indian food, I talked him into having dinner here because of how good it was.  Womp Womp.  Did they change ownership??  There's no such thing as a dinner buffet anymore.  \"Well, I can't eat embarrassing amounts at the buffet, but at least I can order the matter paneer off the menu,\" I thought.  There was one nice host/busser, one food runner, and one disinterested waiter, which got to be a problem as the dinner crowd picked up.  The naan was sub-par; more burnt air bubbles than anything.  My beloved matter paneer was totally different.  It wasn't bad.  Actually, it was pretty decent, but nowhere near as good as it used to be.  We sat at the table, done eating, plates cleared, for a loooong time before I was able to practically tackle the waiter to get our check.  Had I never been here before, this would have been a 2.5-rounded-up-to-3-stars-to-be-generous experience.  But knowing what was and what could have been, this mostly left me disappointed and apologizing to my fiance for misleading him.",

I remember just salivating at the anticipation of going there for lunch as everything was so good!! Now, instead all I had to look forward to was an upset belly once I got back to the office.  The salad that used to be crisp and fresh is now wilted and soggy. The tomatoes, well, what can I say except \"nasty\".  I'm sad that this happened as I loved going to Gandhi but, until I hear otherwise I won't be back for a long while if at all.  I guess Mt.

I've been here countless times but never got around to writing a review, so here goes:  I came here with a group of people and we started off with some vegetable pakoras which were perfectly crispy, yet not dry, as well as tandoori chicken which was served heaping on a sizzling plate and was bursting with flavor. They're definitely a must for me and I keep coming back to those two every time I come here.  For the main meal, I shared a thali with one other person. I especially enjoyed the Matar Paneer, which was delightfully tangy and spicy without being overwhelmingly so, as well as the Aloo Gobi, which was cooked to perfection -- delicate and tender, but not mushy. During the meal, the owner came out and greeted us and even had a special type of kulcha made just for us! To be honest, I can't think of any other places where restaurant owners would give so much time and attention to their customers.  Finally, our group finished off with some generous servings of kulfi, which we were told was made fresh in the kitchen! It had a really nice creamy coconut-ty flavor and was the perfect way to end our meal. I definitely recommend the kulfi to anyone who eats here. I'm not too big on coconut on sweets, but this dessert is one of very few exceptions.  From beginning to end, my experience here was truly spectacular. Unfortunately, I'm not from the area and I haven't been able to find any other Indian restaurants in my area good enough to satisfy my cravings. I always look forward to coming here whenever I'm in Vegas. Next time I'm in town, you know where to find me!",

Decor/music was rather odd...I liked it personally, but was far from what I would consider \"Indian.\"  Buffet food was ok, but rather bland.

Wait staff was very personable and helpful. The food was absolutely delicious. We ordered Chicken Tikka Masala and Dal Makhani and Nan. We thoroughly enjoyed every aspect of our evening. This restaurant comes highly recommended.  It is a little tricky to access, as there are no U turns surrounding it. Be patient, you will be glad you finally made it to the parking lot.

But there's more to a restaurant than the quality of the food. So briefly here's my prob with this place.   First, they raise their prices when they feel it's appropriate - Christmas week. Yes, the week, not the day. How do you justify with no additional menu items? Next, Naan is part of the buffet and good but dry - most buffets serve fresh naan at the table. There was no patek paneer - I know, amazing huh? Finally, the plastic silverware was just too much. $15 buffet with plastic silverware!",

A bit of many different cultural foods. They are tops! I've lived here for 10 years. Dehli is another place to check out. Have an appetite! You'll need it! Ask for extra napkins. Your nose may bit of a problem with the spice. Extra napkins,if you're with comfortable people, blow your nose! It always happen to be my downfall. Anything spicey, though I love the food. Yeah. Run to the bathroom and hoard tissue for the next blast, or tear up.    The spices are what adds flavor.     Try both out. Post your review. Happy buffet time?!",

Hand cooked curry ranging from soothing mild to exciting extra spicy. A selection made to appeal to any culture with an open minded appetite. Or any patron with inquisitive taste buds. Simply put, each one of us were very happy with our dining experience .  As Gandhi once said, \"Happiness is when what you think, what you say, and what you do are in harmony.\"",

We had the biryani goat, regular and bullet naan bread, malai paneer, chicken tikka, and a sweet lassi.  I didn't think there was anything special about the bullet naan. Garlic and regular naan will do.  The sweet lassi was delicious! Not so sweet.  The entrees were delicious! All of them. The chicken tikka is explosive with flavors. Cooked perfectly and not dry. The malai paneer is really good, too. The curry is seasoned perfectly with the right consistency.  The biryani goat was cooked to perfection as well.  The spice was right!   Portions are shareable.   Prices are a little up there, but, trust me, you'll get your money's worth.  It didn't seem to get packed and there's plenty of parking available.    Shout out to the gentleman that helped us on a Sunday evening (didn't catch your name. Sorry) as well as Chrissy for being very attentive and taking care of us.   I will definitely be coming back here.",

And Gandhi Indian rules for great food. Super fresh and still setting up upon arrival. People if you arrive close to closing time expect limited stale selection on the buffet. Sorry.  There were about 16 choices on the buffet line. Tandoori chicken and curry chicken were good. But the vegetarian okra and onions was outstanding. I am southern boy, and never had okra like this. Pic enclosed. Don't know if this is normal, but being early they made special rice and buttered Nan just for me. Am I that important? :)  A tiny bit pricey at $11.95 for the buffet, but worth it.   This place has super high ceilings mad of solid wood, that are a work of art.  Only small downside was horrible Bollywood videos playing on big screen. Just ignore that and enjoy the food.",

My preference is a less sweet butter chicken with a bit more spice, the man who took our order didn't ask how spicy, and we didn't think to ask. But crystal told us they do a 10 scale and if not specified it comes out at about a 3. So next time I'll try a 6... Or the Tikka masala or korma because crystal let us know those won't be as sweet! Naan was delicious the right amount of crispy not too thick just perfect.",

What a good choice, a new feel in the air with a warm welcome, seated with water right away the menu was presented. I ran thru the items and explained what I wanted, a light n small delicious meal without any curries or bread or rice.   The owner, immediately, recommended his preference, not on the menu and assured me that it should satisfy my taste buds.   Well, the owner knows what he was talking about. I was presented with a sizzling plate of Mushrooms and Paneer.   Mushrooms, baked, were lightly sprinkled with home-made gram masala n brushed with butter and Paneer thinly sliced slabs  (OMG what a great flavour) was infused with salt n pepper mix and roasted to perfection. I still after three hours have that flavour, surely it will take me back there soon.    It's a super delight to clean out the platter, to its last morsel, n  walk away flavourful full.  I strongly recommend Gandhi Indian Restaurant, a pleasantly revived vision, new culinary team. A must go for serious Indian food lovers. Ask for the owner to get some out of the menu (secret menu) delicaciess",

We had lamb samosas for the appetizer, then my friend had a goat and spinach dish while I had a vegetable dish. We got naan instead of rice and it was pretty bomb. I enjoyed my friend's dish and she enjoyed mine, so we switched. Hers was creamy and the goat was very flavorful. Mine was a \"farmers\" dish with a sweet and spicy orange sauce. They were both delicious and mood-elevating.  The wait time for the food was very short and we watched Bollywood music videos in the meantime, which were fun and colorful.  We got a couple of mango lassis alongside the meal and finished with pistachio dessert. Everything tasted amazing.  The waitress was very nice and comped the dessert for us, which my struggling student's budget appreciated.  We'll definitely come again, it was worth the money.",

Went last week to the lunch buffet, as soon as we sat down they asked what type of naan we wanted and had it to us almost before we finished getting our first plate from the buffet line. They even made us a dish that wasn't on the buffet line.  Only issue I had was that we had to refill our own water.  Went again today and I don't know what it was but maybe the boss wasn't around.  After sitting down with our first plate and finishing about half of it we finally had to ask if we were getting any naan and to do that we had to interrupt the waiters cell conversation.  When the naan came five minutes later it was somewhat burnt which I don't really care about but the person I was with didn't really care for.   We arrive well before the end of the lunch buffet but shortly after we sat down they started prepping the other tables for dinner, kind of made it feel like there was a rush for us to finish.  Again we had to get our own water refills.  To top it off, after we were most of the way done with our lunch we were told that they couldn't take cards today, cash only, I had to dig around to find enough to cover it, would have been nice if we were told that before we started.",

There was enough food on the tray for two people. Crystal our server came over several times to check on us, also very friendly. The thali also came with desserts. We tried the rice pudding and mango ice cream. Both good choices. Can't wait to come back and try the lunch buffet.

    "text": "So I don't write that many reviews, mostly because I'm rarely moved enough to do so. I will say that my experience with Ghandi Indian Cuisine did not begin entirely positively. I was looking though an online menu, found something I wanted, called in to pick it up - only to find that they weren't willing to pack up the dish I had requested. However, very much in the mood for Indian, I decided I would go down there and dine in anyway.  That was where the negativity ended. When I arrived at the restaurant, Ladi the owner greeted me personally, clearly grateful that I had made the choice to come in.  He remembered what I was trying to order early, and after having a server show me to a booth he came over and took my order personally, and made sure I was comfortable. At this point I had forgotten my earlier disappointment and was enjoying the atmosphere and background hum of upbeat Indian music videos.  I ordered the Ghandi Thali, which is like a sample tray of sorts, with Samosas, Aloo Gobi, Malai Kofta, a Paneer dish and Dahl with naan bread and rice. PLENTY of food.  Standout dish for me was the Aloo Gobi. Had a bit of a kick so you may want to request mild if spice is not your thing, but the flavor was excellent. The malai kofta sauce was a highlight as well. The naan was some of the best I've tasted.  If I were to provide some constructive criticism, I would suggest a revisit of the online menu and removing dishes that are not conducive to pickup or delivery, or at least letting people know that some are dine-in only dishes.  At the end of the day: delicious food, passionate and hands-on ownership, very friendly service and a willingness to go the extra mile to turn customers negative experience into a positive one is what earns my 5 stars.  Bravo Gandhi Indian Cuisine!",

The samosa had a tender crust. For dinner, it would be better to go with a group so you can choose the things to share.   Service was OK but unexceptional. I'd like to go back for lunch to try their buffet.",

I've never tried the buffet, and have been wanting to... but maybe I won't now after what you guys said about it.  I'm also vegetarian, so if their meat is horrible, I have no idea about that.    I have had the Narvatan Korma twice (excellent) and the Aloo Palak (yum!  You can tell it's full of butter...but who cares it's so good).  The first 2 times I was there they brought pappadoms as an appetizer; I was a little disappointed when they didn't on my last visit.  Not usually crowded unless you're there at peak dinner time on weekends.  The room is kind of cavernous, I wouldn't want to sit right in the middle surrounded by tables of people.  Try to get one of the super comfy booths around the outside.     Waiters are nice and super cute!",

They have a really tasty Indian buffet with lots of options.  I am not sure which ones are gluten-free, so the next time I go back to Vegas, I'll have more to report.  The service is alright.  I usually go thirsty for water.  Remember, your lassi is not included in the buffet price.  They do have large bus tours of people who come here en masse, so rub your rabbit's foot to make sure you don't show up at the same time.  Dinner is table service, which isn't the most awesome, and provides less value than the buffet.  Great vegetarian selections.  (Again, will update this again with GF facts.)  The best value for Indian food in Vegas.",

Appetizers like North indian thali and South indian thali was a good variety and lots of it.. Great taste og both chicken and lamb.. \"Best lamb I've ever eaten!\" Was what my husband said, and he always said he didn't like lamb that much... Their kebab is the best! For dessert we can say the Kulfi Mango (icecream) was the favorite at our table.  We were 4 people having dinner, only $125 which we think is very fair price for good food and we were stuffed!:) The have a beer called \"something\" 5000 a nice pilsner, delicious. A lot of locals were there too; always a good sign.  We will be back soon and try the lunch buffet:)",

    "text": "Gandhi- a fresh relaxing place to go enjoy the best indian food in Vegas.         I go to Gandhi every week for the chicken tikka masala and it is the best I have tried anywhere, and I have had this dish in London, Orlando, and many places around the U.S.      I haven't been to India, but can guess and say that this is authentic indian cuisine made by friendly accomodating people. They are all very nice and the restaurant has indian music that adds to the experience. It is nice decor and I highly recommend it to anyone looking to experience this. Going here is an experience, not just a meal in my opinion.       There are foods here that are spicy and different than many things I have tried, but once you know what the dishes are (I didn't know what many were until I went here and tried the great lunch buffet,) but once I tasted them I expanded my food choices a bit.       One of the keys to enjoying a restaurant like this that may be different food than the usual burgers and fries many americans are used to, is that you have to sample different stuff to see what you like. If you dont like hot or spicy food, they will make dishes mild for you.All you have to do is ask. My fav is the tikka masala, and garlic nan with basmati rice.      Try this place-great flavorful food,  cool people, good music and  nice decor and ambiance. -from a regular weekly customer",

Sometimes I will think about who would be willing to go with me for Sunday lunch. I can assure you that EVERY single person I have ever introduced to Indian food by taking them here has begged me to go back immediately. If you've never had indian food, its the perfect place to start because you can pick and choose. It's addicting and you can't really beat the price for a buffet of about $12 per person. The food is so flavorfuls and there is always a ton of variety to choose from.   The outside is nothing to write home about, located in a sketchy parking lot area but inside its like a beautiful indian palace of deliciousness. The service is nice. Like the cashier makes jokes sometimes that I don't immediately understand, but then eventually I do.",

My wife normally loves the tandori chicken but today it was EXTREMELY dry and unedible. We told our waiter about it and he takes the piece of dry chicken from our table and takes it to the back kitchen and seemed to tell the cook that the chicken was bad. Well, no follow up, no apology and he seemed to laugh it off with the female waitress that seemed to be flipping the dry pieces, just picking at them. I've kind of noticed the food was getting lower in quality lately, but didn't say much since it was my wife's favorite Indian lunch buffet. Even the solidly prepared mango lassi was full of ice pieces, didn't taste good and didn't arrive to the table until my plate was nearly finished. I didn't even go for seconds, since there really wasn't anything worth going back for. We have other choices for Indian food and next time it won't be here. Maybe they changed owners?",

Seriously, outside of downtown, they're everywhere, and wedged in between all the nail salons and paycheck-advance stores, you can find some pretty good restaurants, if you don't mind the less-than-breathtaking surroundings.  Gandhi is a solid, reliable Indian restaurant that we've been going to for years.  The building is mysteriously huge, with super-high ceilings and a dining area that goes on for miles, but it does fill up at peak times on the weekends.  The decor is nothing fancy - bare white walls livened up with some wall hangings or framed pictures - but you're not there for the ambience, you're there for tons of spicy food.  When you sit down, they'll plop some pappadom down in front of you (those crunchy cracker-like flatbreads), plus a mint-cilantro sauce and a sweet-and-sour sauce.  I love this stuff, but be judicious in your use of the spicy sauce, because water service can be a bit slow here.  Everything here is good, especially the garlic naan.  The tandoori chicken is yummy, as is the rogan josh, palak paneer, and tikka masala.  Entrees range from $10--12, although they also have special tasting menus (including salad, rice, and dessert) that range from $15--22.  They have a lunch buffet on weekdays that's also an excellent value.  And there's a pretty good selection of beer and wine, including a few Indian beers, to go with your meal.  Nothing fancy decor- or ambience-wise, Gandhi nevertheless delivers good and reasonably priced Indian food in a quiet and pleasant setting.  If Vegas isn't already hot enough for you, spice it up with a trip to Gandhi.  And get the garlic naan!",

    "text": "Having just got off the plane from LA and having not eaten for several hours, I was on the verge of passing out.  (Not really, but I was feeling pretty peckish.)  Jeff and I were driving towards the hotel, when I spotted Gandhi out of the corner of my eye.  Knowing that he likes India, having lived there for over a year, I thought he might like to try.  I am always willing to try a new Indian place.    I got a combination plate that had chicken tikka, some marinated chicken, kafta chopped up and a grilled shrimp.  The plate also came with some lentils, rice, raita, lettuce,paneer in a curry sauce and a curry with shrimp in it.    Jeff got a vegetarian plate that had the same rice, raita and lentils, but he also got a cauliflower dish (I don't remember the name) and some other curried vegetable.  He ate it all, so I know he liked it, but I don't think he loved it.    I loved pretty much everything I got, except the lentils. They needed something.  Salt?  The paneer was delicious.  It reminded me of the fresh cheese my grandmother used to make.  The shrimp curry was delicious, just the right amount of heat to it.  The raita was tasty.  The rice was nothing special.  I liked the naan.  I ate several pieces and I don't normally do that.    Jeff ordered a mango lassi.  He asked that they make it special with no milk, just yogurt.  They did that and he loved it.  He might have ordered another, if he weren't so full.    The service started off really well, but then it went downhill from there.  We got the food and then we never saw the waiters again. They were busy serving others.  So, we waited forever for the bill and a box to take home the leftovers.    The decor was kinda nice, kinda funky, kinda dark and kinda fashionable.  I liked certain parts of the restaurant, like the giant wooden Ganesh near the entrance.  The red on the walls was nice.  The paintings weren't anything special.  They turned up the lights for us, so we could read the menu. There were some special rooms that could be shut off with curtains.  I liked that touch.   I would definitely go back.  I wonder what the buffet would have been like, since we were there for dinner.",

Inspectors called the infestation \"excessively active\" and found the roaches housed inside an excessively greasy burner where food was actively cooking. Roaches were also in the prep area, near the sink and on the hot line.   Gandhi's own pest control reports showed the restaurant requires a complete clean-out to eliminate the roach problem.   We went by to see if any cleaning was going on.Their van was parked outside, but the restaurant's doors were locked.   The sign on the door says they're closed for remodeling, indicating someone should be doing something.  In addition to the roach infestation, inspectors also saw a food handler using expired, 11-day old tomato sauce to cook with.",

Last time we were there, I discovered the eggplant bhartha which was amazing, also, there's a mushroom dish on the menu that was out of this world--and I'm not even a mushroom lover, I barely even like them!  But the sauce was so yummy and delicious.  The samosas are some of the best we've tasted.  Mango lassi and kulfi are excellent.  Please maintain your reputation by hiring and keeping the best cooks ever.    Also on a side note: please make sure you keep your salt level just right.  I don't eat out much, so sodium can be an issue for me at some Indian restaurants.  The spices, onions, tomatoes, etc., give the perfect taste, not so much salt is needed.  So when in doubt, use a pinch less.",

We had the butter chicken, chicken curry, and a lamb dish- as well as the paneer, naan, and garlic naan. Everything came out at the perfect temperature and packed with fresh flavors. The servings were large enough to share and still have extras. I absolutely love Indian and this restaurant has effectively made me a customer for life. I will definitely throw in a visit every time I find myself in Vegas",

    "text": "Truly disappointing lunch buffet. I've been to Gandhi a few times and its been pretty good. This is the first time I tried the lunch buffet and, the fact that I felt compelled to leave a review, should be an indicator of how I felt my meal went. First of all, no one at the front when I came in, i came in and looked at the buffet line and then waited for roughly 2-3 minutes to even see an employee, they finally sat me and I got my first round of food. The tandoori chicken was nearly cold and hard as a rock, the side that was on the chafing dish was charred to a crisp (not always a bad thing). I informed the young waiter that the tandoori chicken was cold, he went and took the temperature of the chicken, said something to his, what looked to be his boss, then closed the lid. Clearly it was under temperature and he tried to reheat it in this way... huge health hazard that could get them closed in of itself. No biryani, only 3 meat dishes and all were chicken, no naan or rice on the buffet line so it had to be brought out which seemed to be difficult to even find someone to help. My drink remained empty for the majority of my meal even though a waiter kept walking by. I finally asked for a refill and it took him about 8 minutes to bring me my refill. Sweet rice for dessert? what the hell is that? Literally their basmati rice that they serve to everyone, mixed with milk and sugar. It was disgusting and the rice was under cooked. I'm Indian... I have never heard of this recipe before.... for 11.95... its a rip off. Enjoy GOOD indian food and drive a block up to Delhi Indian Cuisine.",

You wouldn't expect much based from the outside, but man it has nice wooden ceilings, comfortable, roomy chairs, spacious walk ways, and a chill ambience!   The inside is cozy, variety of booths, tables, and extra large booths. They even have an upstairs level. The place is clean, it smelled amazing and the floors, tables, chairs, and utensils were neatly polished. Staff is very friendly and attentive. Your drinks and dirty plates get refilled and taken away without you even noticing. The food taste and smells absolutely yunmy. There's great variety from vegan to some chicken and the naan is sooo soft and soooooooooo good!   It's perfect for a quick lunch with friends, perfect for a group lunch with your coworkers, perfect for a dinner date with your babe, and perfect for your family. I like how they offer a 10% discount on yelp AND a 10% DISCOUNT for STUDENTS. It's reasonably priced to begin with, considering it's near the strip, even without a discount. For a party of two with a 10% discount, our bill ended up to be $23 plus tip.  This place is an absolute YASSSS! Must try right now. I'd go back any time any day with anyone. Eat here",

That day their staff was in hurry to kick us out without letting us to finish our food. Never be treated like that. We decided not to come to this place ever.   But because of our friend's food desperation and also went through with two other indian resturants(seeing long waiting lines), we have ended up here again during xmas2017 visit. Our bigest mistake was we did not ask the buffet price, thinking it will be normal charges ranging min $12 to max. $15.  Food was very good on that day specially bhindi masala/okra curry was tested freshly made eventhough we arrived at 1:00pm. May be they were out of other curry and replaced with this. Anyway most of buffet dishes veg. and non veg. were very tasty except naan as usual buffet naan never taste good in most of places but that was ok for us. Incident happen when my husband was eating his samosa with green chutney and he found green wire in green chutney(one we use to close plastic bags in store), we informed to waiter and he said ok ok i will let kitchen staff know, nothing else. Thinking that how horribly they manage and care in the kitchen. Although overall food was great, so we neglected that incident, and also their service. but when they charged us $20 per person for our buffet plus added gratuity where service was zero, we were stunned (unethical business behavior).  Request to owner  * Please keep eyes on your staff how they treat your customers, our both experience were horrible. * Courteous behavior in food industry is very much needed.  * Make place little bit spacious so other people's chair don't stuck on the way when we go to serve ourselves from buffet * In second trip, buffet was ridiculously overpriced, please don't change the price in order to take advantage of holiday season. Its not ethical. * being generous, gave one star is only for the chef who work hard in the kitchen o/w youguys don't deserve even one star...",

I found one with an appetizer that looked like a main entree for two!   It was a delicious combination of grilled sausages, shrimp, tandoori chicken...it was fantastic.   The rest of the meal was equally as delicious.  And ended with a frozen mango dessert that was very simple but incredible.     I took half my meal home for tomorrow yet I'm stuffed!  The restaurants Decor is beautiful with many private dining cubbies for larger groups (of 6 plus)  The service was excellent and helpful and clearly commited to giving me a good experience.  I'm glad my yearning for an Indian experience pulled me away from the strip.  I located this place via Yelp and even discovered a small Yelp coupon (never seen one of those before)",

I left full and happy! I will be back again for the lunch buffet. I can't handle a lot of heat in my food and to me, this was PERFECT, not too spicy and not bland either, lot's of flavor. I LOVED the fresh baked naan bread (I got plain). I have been to another Indian place in the area that gets higher stars on Yelp and I personally like this place way better!

    "text": "This restaurant is a hidden gem. First let me say - I'm a local and live close to the strip but I don't really like going to the casinos for a nice dinner. I'm used to fine dining and like a great ambience. I came across a flyer for this restaurant in the highrise where I live, so I thought I would check it out. The food was delicious, the staff was incredible and the restaurant had a nice traditional decor. From the outside you wouldn't think it was anything special but I HIGHLY encourage you to step inside and enjoy a delightful dinner! If you're visiting Vegas, it's close to the Strip and reasonably priced. If your local, this is a great local spot where the staff will treat you like family.  I'll definitely be back. And the Mango Lassi is a must! It's unbelievably delicious.",

They offer a balanced menu of both vegetarian and non vegetarian dishes, both of which are to die for. my favorite would have to be the butter chicken and naan. The lamb chops as appetizers are delicious as well.   Food aside, I definitely want to point out their excellent service and decor. the waiters are attentive and cater to all your needs. The decor is very ancient india inspired with a touch of modernity. . I would definitely say the look is quiet upscale and the prices are affordable. If you want authentic indian cuisine and a comfortable setting then look no further. Gandhi is the place for you.",

Ordered a Chicken Biryani carryout order since dinner buffet was almost on the verge of completion. Let me explain here - I am a food lover and can instantly say by the look of Indian restaurants on what kind of food to expect. There are different versions of \"authentic\" indian cuisines floating around and I must say this is not one of them. Biryani was sweet (authentic biryani is NEVER sweet) with cashew and raisins.  Good luck with this place.",

No, not that Gandhi, he's dead.  Gandhi the restaurant.  What caught my attention were the people.  Dozens of Indian people headed into the restaurant.  Hmm.  \"Best of Las Vegas\" proclaimed the banner.  In this place?  What the heck, my last Vegas review was Fatburger, let's diversify a bit.  The restaurant itself is well appointed, clean, comfy.  Check. Lots of people on the buffet line.  Is there a buffet tonight?  No, they said, that's just for the private party.  Which turned out to be a BUSLOAD of Indian people.    No matter.  I looked at the menu, and ordered one of their combo dishes, along with a large Flying Horse.  Within minutes, complimentary papadum arrived, along with a tamarind sauce and a cilantro sauce.  To my surprise, the papadum were awesome.  Hot, crisp, tasty.  The sauces were excellent as well.  The combo arrived and the food continued to impress.  I haven't had Indian food this tasty and authentic since I was back in NY.  One thing I disliked was the dish - a metal plate with compartments which reminded me of a TV dinner.  I would have preferred to see several small plates, but I guess that would be more work.  The combo included a choice of dessert, and I passed up my usual kheer in favor of a pistachio kulfi ice cream recommended by my server.  It was AMAZING, except for the spoon (see below).  Reading the other reviews, either they have improved dramatically, or perhaps I was the beneficiary of stumbling on this place on a night where they knew they had to have their A game on (or risk upsetting said busload of people).  I would award 4 stars, except that my napkin was slightly dirty, and the spoon accompanying my dessert was clearly dirty as well (as in the dishwasher didn't do a good job).  I left stuffed and content, aka, feeling very un-Gandhi-like.",

    "text": "There is a lot of Indian Cuisine competition but this place does have great service and great comfort food at a good price. I really enjoy the neighborhood competition, Mint Indian Bistro and Origin of India more though, but there is something about this place that continues to keep itself standing, despite this. I would definitely go here if I had more friends who like Indian food or ate out as much as I used to. This place is a lot older. But I live right up the street from this place and if I got tired of frequenting Mint Indian Bistro on Flamingo, I would go here to get a change of setting. I think it is a little more authentic than the Mint, but I am not a fan of authentic, I like a little bit of flare to my food that is catered to Americans. My friend likes this place more than Mint, so maybe they have some special dishes that stand out for vegetarians...  Again, because it sits in a terrible neighborhood, the fact that it still survived the many years of recession probably says a lot about the authenticity of their dishes. I don't know a lot about their off the buffet menu entrees but I hear they are pretty good.  The decor has antique wood and has a fine dining appeal with the table cloth and nice water glass. But, this seems to be  a common theme for all of the Indian Restaurants, they are very properly set.  The Indian food buffet is a good deal, but if I had patience I would order off the menu because they will cook it to order and the food will taste fresh and more flavorful.",

As we debated whether it was worth waiting for, a couple of guys pulled up next to us and RAVED about place...saying \"It's REALLY good...It's HELLA good...\"  So, hearing this, we had to come back at 5 pm and so we did...what a mistake!  As we piled in at 5:30 pm, we looked around at the customers already seated. Lots of Indians were already dining and we took this as a good sign...and then we saw the buffet table set up.  Hmmm...we were hoping for an a la carte menu.  Unfortunately, they only had the buffet option available and so we were stuck with that.    We ordered Mango Lassi to drink and that was a highlight.  Then we all loaded up for the buffet line.  Gandhi's offers a mix of North and South Indian cuisines and I was disappointed with pretty much everything available.  I usually want Indian food when I desire lots of rich spices and tastes going on, and all th dishes simmering away lacked any full or individual flavors.  There was no spice, no heat, nothing that stood out! Blah!    They offered mint-cilantro sauce, but no pappadoms!  Argh.  I love pappadoms and they didn't have any!  I was already disappointed!  I love naan bread in general, but usually try the garlic or onion kinds, or whatever else is offered.  Not at this place, they just had plain naan bread that lacked any real flavor.  Everything had potatoes in it, too much potatoes if any.  One of my dining companions felt that she didn't eat her money's worth and went back for dessert - the mango/condensed milk dessert with fruit cocktail.  We all agreed that was the only thing worth eating there.  How sad is that?!  Sure...I ate...I was hungry.  It wasn't particularly good Indian food.  It was just that...food, and nothing else.  This restaurant was noted as award winning and \"Best Ethnic Restaurant in Las Vegas\" at one point.  I would assume they were a pretty decent Indian restaurant some time ago, but no longer.  I guess it's a sign when an Indian restaurant starts out with an a la carte menu, then ditches it completely to go for the buffet thing, it means hard times.  They are strapped and desperate for business.  Too bad I won't be that desperate enough to come here again unless I'm dragged.  Yeah, for the price of less than $17/pp, you get more bang for your buck this way, but that's not why I came to Gandhi's to eat.",

    "text": "Despite being located in a seedy strip mall, a friend and I had previously tried this place for dinner, and it was decent, 3-star territory. However a recent visit to try their lunch buffet was a different story. The first thing that stuck out was the cheap plastic plates, disposable plastic eating utensils, and styrofoam/plastic cups for water and soups/sauces. I have been to many Indian lunch buffets, but this was the first time I've seen such cheap dining ware being used. While they had several vegetarian offerings, they only had a couple of mediocre meat dishes: chicken tikka masala and tandoori chicken. There was a huge tray of naan which looked overly doughy and dried out so I didn't even bother trying it. The subpar mango pudding was too watery and contained cheap canned fruit. The halwa dessert was extremely dry and just gross. My friend and I commented that the only thing at the buffet that they seemed to do pretty well was the basmati rice.  When the bill came, I was in for another shock. $12.95 for an Indian lunch buffet?!? That has got to make this the priciest one in town since most are in the range of $9.99 to $10.99. Now if this buffet was one of the best, I probably wouldn't mind paying a premium price. Come to think of it, if they lowered the price to $8.95, it still wouldn't be worth it. There are just too many better places in town, i.e. Taj Palace or Mt Everest., to waste your appetite on this one.",

We took the Lunch Buffet which I felt was kinda OK. The best part of all was the Tandoori Chicken. Delishhh...one of the best I've tried. The rest were passable.
