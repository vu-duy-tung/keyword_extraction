Pulled up this location and was glad I came here.   Ordered clams and Dungeness crab. Good was fresh, hot, delicious and full of flavor!! I chose the spicy smokin seasoning and probably burnt my mouth off from underestimating the spicy, so beware. Sooooo juicy and Delish!   Service was great and definitely ask for Phil, he'll take care of you. I'll be in a food coma for my 2.5 hour flight home. :)",

Back to the food...... I ordered the mix of dungeness crab with Crawfish, shrimp & clams with the urban mix spicy sauce...... with the Kagua Japanese Belgian style ale........still mind blowing ......when the dish arrived one of the lovely ladies offered to help me crack the Dungeness crab, she was so nice & I giggled as she took out the pieces I didn't want to eat........I was tickled.........I enjoyed the seafood mix so much that I asked for more sauce......the Japanese beer was a rare find and is highly recommended.......much better than the competition.......endless flav",

We had the dungeness, snow crab and shrimp with sides of sausage, corn, potato, rice. Tried different sauces. I agree with the rest that the Mild  is about as spicy as I'd go. The extra mild is good for those who can't tolerate heat - even it has a kick.  You can always order a side of hotter sauce if you want to kick it up. Tried the lemon pepper on the shrimp and it was yummy too.    Each person on the wait staff was terrific.  Will return!",

I had the smokin sauce and loved it, but it was very spicy and garlicky. They also had some interesting and hard to find items on the menu- alligator, frogs legs, etc.   They did mess up a few of my groups' orders... Everything was resolved in the end, I suspect it was from the confusion of such a large group! But that keeps them from being 5 stars for me.

I came back the sec time because I was giving them the benefit of the doubt for it being a grand opening the first time. The first time I ordered a lbs of shrimp And the sauce was watery. The second time I ordered a combo meal. Snow crab, clams and crawfish. Their sauce is waaaaay salty!!! I felt like the more I ate it the more my tongue was burning from the salt. The flavor was good but I think If they tone down the salt a notch and maybe add a lil sugar it would've been waaaay better. I'm from Cali and when it comes to Cajun food, Cali is a pro at it. Don't think I will come here again. Sorry guys but I did give them a second chance. Didn't do it for me.",

    "text": "OK, I (we) have been to all the crawfish places in town and will have to say this place is about a tie with Boiling Crab.  Pluses: VERY friendly and attentive staff. Corn was better than other joints. Potatoes were cook just right and not mushy. Had bread available for 'cutting the heat' or dipping in the sauce. Crawfish were slightly better cooked than competition  Minuses: Small napkins instead of rolls of paper towels. Crawfish and especially the shrimp were smaller than competitors. Smaller capacity seating. Not as much garlic in their signature sauce (Boiling Crab has awesome amounts with larger chunks in theirs)  My strongest endorsement is that we will most definitely will be back.  Good job Smokin' Crawfish.  Address the minus issues and you guys will be the King Crab of the crawfish restaurants in Vegas.  Cheers!",

Three pcs from the 1lb mussels had no mussel in it lol. The shrimp was fairly small compared to what im used to in LA. They forgot to bring our fried tilapia...then the waitress acted like it was our fault after she questioned why it hasnt arrived yet. No drink refill for a long time. food was just not good, none of that garlic chunks u look for and squeeze your shrimp on. Not sure why they have 4.5 stars, i guess Las vegas standards are a bit low for this type of food.",

    "text": "We have been to every single Crawfish place in Vegas; I saw this new on Yelp with raving rating, had to come try! It was a Sunday night during the Memorial Day weekend, the place wasn't busy at all when we walked in. We were seated right away.  Crawfish in garlic butter, 2lbs, mild: Perfect level of spice for me, didn't taste much garlic in there, mostly butter and spice. The crawfish sizes were decent and mostly fresh, I found a few dead ones in there.  Shrimps in All Together sauce, 1lb, mild: We did like the taste of the sauce; however, they put way too much butter in it, which makes it a bit greasey when eating half way.   Fog legs, with sweet potato fries: The Fog legs were so good because they were perfectly seasoned and cooked. They gave us 4 legs per order, the size of them was huge! Just the way I liked it. The sweet potato was just alright, somewhat mushy; we only ate a few and pretty much left the entire order there.  Service: We were greeted and served by Billy. Now, we did like Billy, he was nice, friendly, talkative. However, when specifically asked if we can order the Fog Leg a-la-carte, because we didn't want to have any fries, he said no, it comes with the fries. So we said ok, just give us the sweet potato. Then when we paid, they added $2.00 extra for the sweet potato. We found that's a very bad way to trick customers paying a little bit more. Hence, 2-star off here.  We went over the HotNJuicy right across street after we left here, they were so packed even at 9pm. We ordered some more to-go and enjoyed the night at our hotel.",

I prefer to order crawfish from Hot N Juicy but this location has fantastic crab, lobster, shrimp, and great deals on oysters (Monday). I think the reason I prefer Hot N Juicy for crawfish is because the sauce is thinner so it can get into the little shells better. However the thicker sauce at Urban Crawfish Station coats larger seafood better because it doesn't usually soak into the shells that well anyway.",

We thoroughly enjoyed their music choices and it wasn't too loud or overbearing like some places are. The prices were clearly marked and our waitress answered all of our questions. We ended up getting the cajun fries, and 2 lbs of their clams, medium spice, all 4 sauces mixed. I really enjoyed the clams, however, my only gripe (and why I've given 4 stars) is the sauce needs to be a little thicker in my opinion. It felt too watered down, but the flavor was definitely there. Other than that, everything was fantastic! The prices were reasonable and we were pleasantly surprised to have only spent under $40. Another cool thing we noticed is they have combo sets and you get X amount of seafood for that set price. They all varied in what they have in the combos, but from what we saw it looked worth it. We will definitely be back and bring friends here. Glad we stopped in! Really enjoyed the lobster claw machine game in the back, I really want to use it next time haha.",

This place was super clean and the decor was super cute, but the food just did not come through.   We ordered 2 pounds of crawfish and 2 pounds of clams with spice level SPICY. We sat around for 30+ mins and our food never came out. We waived down the server a couple times and apparently the kitchen \"forgot\". We got our clams first then 15 mins later we got our crawfish. I HATE eating this separately so this was a huge turn off for me. It was so poorly made that the crawfish and clams did not soak in any of the sauce. Also, the sauce was NOT spicy AT ALL. It tasted more like mild-medium. It wasn't a gross meal, but it definitely wasn't an outstanding one.  The service was great, but everything else was just ok or meh.

Originally I had actually wanted to go to Rockin Crawfish or Boiling Crab for Crab Legs, but both locations closed at 7 today, I wasn't upset since it's a holiday. But it would have been nice. Than this place popped up on my map. It's significantly closer to my house and was open until 9, which is great because Jacob and I knew we wouldn't be able to eat till 7:30.  When we first walked in, we noticed it wasn't busy, except there was one server; Billy. Billy is super amazing, but it got busy fast. I was determined to have Crab, and I got my Crab, spicy with their recommended seasonings, super good. Looooots of garlic. Jacob ordered the shrimp fried rice because we mainly went there to satisfy my craving for seafood. We also ordered a side of bread, the Cajun fries and Billy recommended the baked oysters as well. He really sold us on it. So we ordered that too.   I loved my Crab. At one point I realized the sauce was being wasted on the gloves so I decided to ditch them (don't touch your eyes the same day), and digged into the deliciousness. I liked how they serve you the whole Crab. But in my opinion it's cheating. The top shell of the Crab is the heaviest, so you are losing a lot and paying for the same price, but my side of rice with the sauce filled me up. Jacob said he like the fried rice, but he said the shrimp was overdone and \"shriveled up\" as he liked to say. I know we are a bit picky since we have both worked in kitchens as cooks, but I think it would have been better if they used larger shrimps instead of the Bay shrimp.   This next part is why we are giving 4 instead of 5 stars. Billy was super busy, and we are sorta glad this turned out this way, but we didn't get our fries or the oysters (although they still sound good and we do love oysters). We weren't charged for it, but he did seem forgetful. For good reason. About 20 minutes in, he got a good 4 more tables in. For those who don't realize how difficult it is to handle 3 news tables at once, a large party of 8 and try and get everyone's food and drinks, it's difficult. But I can't not take away one star for forgetting both of our appetizers.   Billy is awesome. Be careful though. He is a little too good at upselling. I'm surprised he didn't try and sell me his car, he's pretty good at selling you things you didn't even think you wanted...",

We patiently waited in our car and to our surprise right at noon a young man opened the door and waved at us to come in.  High five, Dude!  Not only did you open on time, you actually acknowledged us!  Like \"hey, common in\". He made me feel like we were his best friends stopping by his home.  To our surprise this awesome guy happened to be our waiter.  His name was Billy from Alaska.  He was knowledgable about the menu and really helped us decide what to have.    We decided on one of their specials, the $59.95 \"Smokin' Deal\".  And let me tell you, it was smokin!  Absolutely worth he price.  The 2 of us shared 1.5lbs of snow crab, one pound of shrimp and one pound of clams.  It also came with corn, potatoes and sausage. For flavor we had the \"smokin style\" and heat level of 8.   It was great! A little to spicy for my taste but I survived.  The Husband loves the heat so of course I obliged!  We also opted for an order of the bacon wrapped shrimp thanks to Billy's suggestion.  I highly recommend these little babies if you enjoy bacon.  YUM.  We did grab some of the Kumamoto oysters too.  I mean it is my husbands last day off for a while and well...these little suckers are known to be an aphrodisiac after all.     The ambiance is great inside and the seating is comfortable.  The restaurant is on the Southeast corner  next to the asian supermarket (to the right).    While we didn't try anything else they did offer a few meals like shrimp fried rice  that we were told is a huge portion, salmon and a pasta option.  They offer po-boy sandwiches and other non seafood options like chicken wings, frog legs and French fries, 3 different kinds.  I highly recommend this place.  They offer more than the other restaurants that are comparable.  Service is amazing and the location is great as its maybe 2 minutes from the freeway.",

So he goes to stay we're trying to figure out where it came from, and my manager is willing to take 5% off your ticket which money wasn't the reason we let him know, it's the principal that the manager never came out, or they should have offered to make another meal, so we told them the 5% isn't necessary, plus we still gave a tip to the waitress because she was a sweet lady. The restaurant does have a good atmosphere, but the service is not legit period",

The last time we came here we ordered the Avenue 2 and spaghetti (without the seafood since it was for the kids) and the owner told us he can do that for us and charged us a very good price. I was very pleased with the generosity and making that for us.   We came back today during lunch and ordered the same thing. We told our server, a young man that we ordered the spaghetti before for our kids, and he said no problem. We get our check and he charged us a full price (spaghetti with seafood) even though we didn't GET THE SEAFOOD..just the noodles and sauce. I was very disappointed and cheated. He told us he couldn't adjust that into the system or whatever. He didn't even tell us he was going to charge us a full price for JUST noodles and sauce. He should've told us up front before ordering. The server told us we can come back and talk to the owner about it. Anyways, we paid for everything and said we would return to talk to the owner next time. I've never paid $16.99 for spaghetti.",

That didn't really bother me because the fish was good but it was her attitude that mad everything seem so sour! My waiter took the fish off the bill which was ok but I order to pay to get the correct fish and the cook wasn't having it.

    "text": "For my 1000th review, I'd like to talk about something I just love and crave - crawfish.  Those that know us, they know we just love seafood and we were regulars among the crawfish circuit.  However, we took a little break after having Little Guy and Little Gal because it's just hard to get down and dirty when you have two kids with you.  But we are back...and hitting the crawfish cravings hard!  We are always open to healthy competition among our old favorites and standbys and gave Smokin' Crawfish a go.  The crawfish was exceptionally clean, which is something we really appreciate and the flavoring is good. I'm all about some serious good head juice and their crawfish has it good -  so sweet and oh so yum!  (Smokin' Style and mild is our current flavor profile and we only order crawfish.)  After getting our initial fix here, we went back to our old place the following week and just found ourselves wanting more Smokin' instead.  And so we came back again and again.  We were there on a weekly basis for awhile, which is a big deal when you get limited date nights.  We even returned despite the Husband getting some Smokin' Style juice straight into the eye and having a major Hitch moment.  (Not a pretty sight shall I say, and pretty scary for a moment there too.)    Two pounds of crawfish will get you a potato and corn thrown in, but we usually opt for all potatoes.  We also like to do two pounds at a time so the crawfish stays nice and hot and we can pace ourselves.  I crave crawfish these days and we can't wait until we get our date nights to get down and dirty there.  Plus, their music choice just rocks when I'm there! I find myself grooving when I'm eating, and it's probably because I'm just so happy eating crawfish again.  But they have some serious TV action happening here, so we can easily catch up on our favorite sport teams while we grub too.  Parking is easy breezy here which is a major plus.  They have some nice happy hour deals on beer buckets which I notice are quite popular.  In the back, there's a lobster claw machine where you can win a lobster for $2.  If you catch it, they'll cook it!",

If you can catch a lobster they'll cook it for you. I came so close to catching one! I thought the flavor was okay. I wish they had some type of dipping sauce and that their stuff was more spicy than their spicy. The crawfish was super tiny and didn't taste too clean. The rice was also very hard.

Since its our first time here I wanted to get something simple I ordered 1lb of crawfish with urban mix (because I looooove crawfish) plus they were seasonal so must get them now before they're gone! My bf ordered 1lb of snow crab legs with urban mix too and let me tell you every digging and bite were bursting with flavors!!    Oh man definitely get the potatoes add into it I've had many potatoes at many different crawfish places but I have to say nothing beats what magical potatos they have here it taste like sweet potatos (maybe it goes along so well with their urban sauce mix) I can't really tell but it was soooo delicious I promise I was sober at the time too maybe I like it a lot since I'm a potato lover who knows anyways I'll have to get corn next time too. By the way we got them both under medium spice since it's a super hot day  (111 degrees!) I didn't want the spicyness to overwhelm (otherwise I love spicy food in general)   Both were very fresh the meat from the crab legs slips out easily and juicy just like how it should be! The crawfish weren't too big but an ok size I still enjoy every bits of it all in all flavorful and fresh I can tell its fresh because it took them awhile to bring them out I thought it was worth the wait sometime places like this you have to be patient if you want something good. We went around the afternoon (on a Friday 4pm ish) it wasn't too pack at the time.  The place looked pretty clean the vibe was chill the servers were very nice one of which I remember was Billy he kept us pretty entertained and kept us up to date with the menu which I thought was very nice and made sure our drinks were filled. Overall super chill.   They won me over today (sorry hotnjuicy) it was a tough call but I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town!i",

Mika was our sever and couldn't be nicer. I highly recommend this restaurant over Hot & Juicy Crawfish for sure.  There's no long lines and the menu is more diverse",

Our platters had shrimp, crab, lobster, mussels, clams, crawfish, corn, and potatoes with a medium spicy seasoning. The food was awesome, the waitress (Kim) was helpful and funny. We all really enjoyed the food and atmosphere (causual but not dingy). I know I will definitely come back again next time I'm in town.",

I'm not sure how this company is still in business. The food took long to arrive and we order raw oysters and that came 10 mins after our hot food.  In the middle of the meal, a young gentleman came in for an interview. The African American waitress attempted to unprofessionally greet the young men. She is yelling across the restaurant and of course no one knows who she is talking to. The young gentlemen doesn't hear or realize she is attempting to address him. She has to walk over to the door to \"properly\" address him of which he informs her he is here for an interview. She does not address him any differently ... like maybe a welcome... thank you for coming in... no customer service skills. However, this waitress had the audacity to yell to the manager in the kitchen \"you have a very slow person here for an interview\" Whoaaa whoa whoa... Was that called for?! Everyone in the restaurant that heard her was appalled and disgusted. This situation made my HR spidey senses tingle. I had to share some knowledge with the owner. I hope the young gentlemen that was interviewed either gets the job or sues for discrimination. I hope the owner gives a corrective action or terminates the wrongful employee!",

I got a to go order of a pound of mussels and a pound of shrimp with some potatoes and corn. Got it all flavored the same, the Urban Mixx done spicy. For seafood boils, I want my seafood fresh and for the sauce to be a little on the thick side so it really sticks. This place is doing it right. The Urban Mixx was flavorful and the sauce was a decent thickness. It wasn't clumpy, but it wasn't just all liquid. With unpeeled shrimp, most times the sauce doesn't get to the meat. When I peeled the shrimp and dipped it in the excess sauce, it hung on well so I could really taste the flavor on the shrimp. Overall, a great experience. Definitely recommended and planning to return to this location on my next visit.",

She had the Cajun Garlic Butter Salmon.  The rice was tender, the sauce was spicy - but not overbearing.  The fish was cooked masterfully.  Moist and flaky, not falling apart all over the place.  The crawfish.  I got a bag with corn and sausage; spicy Louisiana style.  The heat was PERFECT.  It was hot, but I never had to stop and sit because my mouth was on fire.  Many places struggle to find the delicate balance between flavor and heat, but that struggle was nowhere to be found here.  The sausage was tender, boiled in the same juices.  The crawfish pinched apart beautifully, the tail meat came out in one smooth piece, and of course, the head!  Sweet and savory, soft and buttery..   All around, one of the more fun and vibrant restaurants I've been to!",

Located on the southeast corner of Spring Mt & Decatur in the Big SF Supermarket (on the right side of it), Carls Jr, & Chevron plaza. Inside is very spacious, nicely decorated and super clean. Plenty of seats so I've never had to wait a ridiculous amount of time like I would have at boiling crab or hot n juicy. Service is excellent! Servers are very nice and super attentive.   URBAN MIX SAUCE is freaking AMAZEBALLS!! This place has a fighting chance against Boiling Crab n Hot & Juicy!!  I think with a little more networking and advertisements this place could go a LONG WAY!!   Crawfish - nice, big and juicy  Clams - good. Use the shell to slurp up that yummy flavorful sauce lol  Mussels - good  Shrimp - Big & juicy   Blue Crabs - good but would rather get the snow or king crab if you want to get your crab fix on. Blue crab is more work less crab meat  Cajun fries - good would taste better a bit crispier  Sweet potato fries - yum!   Alligator Basket with fries - Served like popcorn chicken in little fried popcorn nugget like pieces. Fried and seasoned nicely. Served with fries  Oysters on a half shell - very fresh. Yum! Come for happy hour m-th 12pm-5pm for $1 oysters n $2 beers  This is my new go to Crawfish place!! The flavors here are amazing. The menu selection and prices are great too!! Been here 2 times in 1 week so far and am excited to go back again soon to try everything else they have to offer on their menu. Can't wait! There is also a Lobster Claw catch game by the restrooms $2 per play which is fun n cool! Note to owner: if you could move that anywhere else in the restaurant towards the front where it would be more visible it will probably be more profitable bc it it looks like a fun game to play while we wait. I mean who doesn't want to try to catch a lobster and have the restaurant cook it up for you!?! Lol",

    "text": "Screw the 1 hr 30 minute wait at the Boiling Crab franchise. I love shrimp but I can go to the grocery store, drive home, season and boil shrimp, eat them and fall asleep in an hour and a half.  However, saving me the effort and frustration, I was happy to walk back to my car and find Urban Crawfish Station on YELP. I called and no wait for a Saturday evening... and it's a 5 minute drive from BC.   The place has an intimate, bar like atmosphere which was nicer than the stressful, loud, long lined, BC. The menu had variety and I really appreciated their combo options. Their Road Combo was perfect for my husband and me to be full with left overs. Bummer there was no blue crab, and you can't double up poundage on Shrimp... so we got Crawfish and Mussels in addition.  Highly recommend their Urban Mix seasoning. It taste just like other places.. but you don't have to wait an hour for it. It has a little kick with the cajun so if you're a spice wimp like me, bear that in mind. Otherwise it's nothing a little rice couldn't neutralize.   Also, service is great! I thought that this place just opened but no.. their service is just like they are a new business. The manager/owner came around and checked up on us a couple of times which was very nice!  I'm dubbing this our go to place for future seafood boil cravings.   If only those 100 people looked at YELP for this place, they wouldn't have still been waiting in line as we drove home happily full!  But now that I've written this review, I've probably enticed more people to come thus creating a line.. ARG.",

You get to pick 4 different seafood items that they place on the table. It also comes with corn, sausage, and potatoes.  dungeness crab 4/5 stars shrimp 3/5 stars  mussels 4/5 stars craw-fish 3/5 stars (only because they were extremely small) Chicken wings 4/5 stars (LOL)",

The calamari was good except the portion got way smaller this time around.   The 5 lbs of \"alive\" crawfish did not taste alive to me. EVERY SINGLE CRAWFISH was soggy and mushy. I'm no kidding. The shell from head to tail was soft! I was so disappointed. I even had to ask our waiter if these were alive! Of course he made up some bogus story that they were alive and he even found a turtle in the shipment and kept it. BUT last time I checked, alive crawfish isn't suppose to fall apart. The crawfish were also all so small that it was sad. They were smaller than my index finger.   I didn't like their sauce this time around either. It tasted watered down and lacked in that strong Cajun flavor.   The service was slow and forgetful. Our food came our different times within 10 minute frames of each bag. It wasn't even that busy and the servers couldn't get the orders right. Our waiter kept forgetting to get our beer and was so slow on getting anything we asked.   WHATS EVEN WORSE... My boyfriend found not one, but two strands of hair in our bag.",

We came when it was between lunch and dinner so there wasn't that many people there.  The waitress that sat us was friendly and funny.  We started off with frog legs and alligator tail. These were battered and fried and the basket version is served with fries.  The frog legs were big and cooked just right. It wasn't dry like others I have tasted.  The alligator tail was also cooked right. I would have liked them to be chopped up in a different shape than bite size squares, but thats just a quirk of mine. I also should have ordered something different than ranch dressing to dip in.  For the main course, We ordered the $69.95 platter that consisted of lobster, crawfish, clams, and shrimps. We also ordered 1 additional Dungeness crab. This was sauced with their Louisiana style sauce, medium heat so not too spicy.  When I opened up the lobster it was like Christmas for me! It had the orange roe and the gooey fat that I love! It was so fat and sweet, I wish I had another! The crawfish too were big and juicy. We didn't intensionally order the clams, we actually ordered mussels. But that mistake was fine because that was good too and cooked just right.  The crab was somewhat disappointing because it wasn't as fat as I anticipated but the meat was sweet and delicious. The shrimp were okay, a little overcooked but that was mainly for my friend who didn't really like crawfish that much. If it wasn't for the crab, I would have given this place 5 stars. But I will back again, maybe they will get that 5 star then.",

Everything was really good! In comparison to the competitors down the road (*ahem* B.C.), I liked their sauce much better- it was more on the sweeter side, and this was based on \"extra mild\" spice. My boyfriend was indifferent to the different sauces- he thinks both are really good and couldn't choose one or the other. I used the special offer on Yelp and got a dozen oysters for $12! Not sure how often they have this $1/oyster special, but that was a plus.   Service? Service was on point. They were very attentive, friendly, and made us feel comfortable. We had Kevin as our waiter and he was great! The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll definitely be back :)",

First & formost our server Chris was very accommodating, it was our first time here & we had a lot of questions. She answered them all without making us feel stupid.  We ordered a combo meal with king crab, shrimp, & Crawfish. And the sauce was the house special sauce called urban mix or something like that. I was going to do it mild  spice but because I told her that, she suggested that I do no spice. I'm glad I did because it was perfect! It was savory & spicy enough for my taste level. I also ordered the alligator & fries basket. They were both great. The fries were crispy & alligator was great. She also told us about their fried rice. I'm glad I got that. Most restaurants out in Vegas make it very dry. This was perfect & tasty. Didn't even need you sauce. And I was only going to get water but she also told us that they have young coconut. I didn't know what that was, but upon further explanation, I was told that it's a coconut with the top cut off. You can drink it! Pretty awesome.  Chris came back during our meal & took care of us. They were a little busy but I felt that we weren't being rushed out of there. Great food & perfect service.",

Don't slander me just because you don't know how to read customer reviews closely.  -----  A weird experience. Food was decent, but the woman who appeared to be the owner was incredibly rude. Our waitress had a bad attitude to everyone there too, not just to us.  We arrived with the owner burning incense and praying at the front door. That was fine, but she kept us standing there for 5 min. and wouldn't let us sit down. As in, she blocked the entrance and wouldn't let us move around her to be seated.  A few people at other tables asked the waitress if she would recommend one drink over another, and her curt responses were so unpleasant. All I kept hearing was \"I don't drink, if you want it just get it!\" and \"I don't know how that tastes. Get it, if you don't like it then oh well. It's your money.\" No one was giving the owner or waitress any sort of attitude.  They kept forgetting our order and coming back to confirm. What's so hard about 1 lb of shrimp, some fries, and a milk tea?? They forgot my drink and served it 45 min later. I had to ask 3 times. The restaurant was empty with the exception of 2 other couples there.  As a server, even if you don't eat the food there or don't drink yourself, you always hear from customers about what tastes great. You can make recommendations based on that, instead of giving a nasty attitude to paying customers.  There are plenty of other Cajun seafood places in the area so I won't be back. All the praying for money and return customers won't do you any good - how about you learn to be nice to customers and that way you won't lose them.",

Pieces!! My waitress was nice and took it back cause it was a mess! She did bring a new order that was Much better!! Large succulent legs on a cluster with meat that was sweet and juicy, just how I like them. Yumster!!! Rice was major Yum! Catfish was tasty and who could go wrong with Sweet Potato Fries!!!! Blue crabs were large, and sauce was on 10!!! Environment: Nice shiny tables with tv's around bar area.  I will return and munch on some crab and fried rice and try the alligator!!! Ummmm hmmmmm",

He's so nice! He made our lunch a pleasant experience.  I checked in & I got 6 oysters for $1 each. That was our starter.   We got 3lbs of seafood. 1 of shrimp, 1 of crawfish, & 1 of clams. We got mild smokin' sauce or whatever their house flavor was called.  So good. It came with potatoes, corn, and sausage.  It was one of their package deals on one side of their menu, $38 We also got a side of Cajun fries. Amazing.  Crunchy and spicy. Really flavorful.   I recommend this place to everyone looking for a finger-licking seafood experience.",

We ordered for a family of five, 3 lbs of crab legs, 1 steam shrimp, 2 fried shrimp platters. And a coconut shrimp. The steamed shrimp comes with heads still attached, and sadly were bland and mushy. But the fried shrimp and crab legs were very good. I do recommend going just bring your own old bay seasoning.",

    "text": "Read all the great reviews so decided to try for myself. Came in on a Wednesday night around 8:45pm. There was only 1 other table eating however it was the owner. So basically service was all focused on us lol.   Ordered the fried oyster basket & Cajun fries for starters. I asked for extra crispy for both but when it came out it was just regular unless that's their standard for extra crispy....   The fried oysters weren't bad, it was just fried oysters haha. However the \"Cajun\" fries were 5/10. Super bland, not much seasoning for Cajun fries and I just wish they were as crispy & tasty as hot n juicy & boiling crab's.   I got a pound of crawfish( Urban Mix / Medium spicy) and my bf ordered a pound of shrimp (urban mix/ mild). The crawfish was unfortunately frozen today because it's not in season. But it was tasty, very garlicky which is how I like it! It wasn't as spicy as I wanted mine to be because usually when I order medium spicy at BC or Hot n Juicy im there's a good burning feeling that I like.   Side note: I love when there's plenty of extra sauce in the bag to dip my fries in but there was barely any sauce in this bag. :(   It was kind of awkward because there was no music playing so it was just silent where I felt like I had to whisper or the waiter would hear me lol. they eventually turned on the music when more people came in.   Even though the crawfish sauce was tasty, I always eat Cajun fries w/ my crawfish so I probably won't come back. I love love love hot n juicy & boilingcrabs Cajun fries.",

Me and my girlfriend were just trying to have a small snack before heading home for the night and he keeps making awkward small talks and was incredibly racist at some points. When he asked where we were from and I told him I was from Vietnam he said that \"you speak English well\" - because after living in America for most of my life that would be surprising. I hope he didn't think that was a compliment because I sure don't.   The food was average but because we felt like we were harassed by the waiter I'll never go back. He didn't even back off when we made it clear we were a couple.",

In comparison to the other restaurants in town that have a similar menu and dining experience, this place competes. The flavors are good and I really liked their warm French bread you can order as a side. However, the reason for my 2 stars is the overall discomfort felt by the server. He would stop by our table and make jokes/small talk that were just really uncomfortable and even somewhat racist. When I ordered white rice as a side he responds with, \"but I'm already here\" then turns to my (black) boyfriend and continues with, \"eh? I thought you'd like that joke\" ?????  The rest of the servers were friendly and attentive and like I said, the food was good. But come at your own risk and hope for a better experience with your server.",

    "text": "First off, if you haven't seen my past reviews of seafood spots, I am a HUGE shellfish fan. I love my crab, shrimp, oysters and clams. Living in a desert oasis AKA Las Vegas it is very challenging to find a decent True seafood spot, and I'm not talking about your run of the mill strip joints. I am always on the hunt for the local family owned authentic places where I can get my seafood fix on.  Soooo aside from Boiling Crab, Hot 'N Juicy Crawfish and Crab Corner, options can be very limited as far as True affordable seafood. In comes Smokin' Crawfish, in the heart of Chinatown kitty-corner on the SE side of Spring Mountain & Decatur, next to the SF asian supermarket. Parking was fairly easy, got a spot directly in front of the joint. Holy Crap! it opens at Noon (like their fellow eat spot neighbors, except for Pho So 1) and its 11:55.  As Ellen F. and I waited in our car for the joint to open the front door opens and a smiling friendly looking dude (Billy) waves us in. AWESOME! totally catering to potential customers and inviting us in instead of standing around and chit-chatting with other employees (as you've seen at other establishments). He sat us down and explained how their menu works.   They have different combos that include your choice of anything from King Crab, Snow Crab, Lobster, and Dungeness with a choice of mix and match of  Crawfish, Clam, Mussel, Shrimp and Blue Crab. It also included 2 corns, 2 potatoes, and 6 sausages. All for $59.95, honestly not bad deal considering the variety (seafood like this is never cheap). More than enough for me and wifey.  They offer several different sauces. Garlic butter, lemon pepper, louisiana style, cajun and \"Smokin Style\" which is a combo of all of the sauces together (highly recommended). Lets just say I was more than satisfied with the portions. I also ordered a half dozen Kumamoto Oysters which were bomb with horseradish, cocktail sauce and tabasco. We also got bacon-wrapped shrimp and I drank 2 heinekens.   I have to say this place was much better than Cravin Cajun (now closed) which offered similar delights, the atmosphere was comfortable and clean. The service was great, Billy kept checking in with us and was totally friendly and patient with our questions (I am very inquisitive). The only negative about the place was the prices were steep, with just Ellen F. and I the check came out to $125 before the tip, I did also order another pound of snow crab though. But for this kind of delicacy it is in line with the rest price wise, and I don't mind paying for good seafood. Will definitely be coming back again next time I'm jones-ing for flavored crab.",

    "text": "I'm itching to change my ratings for Boiling Crab and Hot and Juicy because Urban Crawfish Station is BY FAR the winner. I only wish I had known about this place sooner!  One major plus is that they do actual combos, which offer you more in quantity than just picking from a la carte. For example, if you buy individually, it's by the pound while the combos can range from 1.4-1.75 lbs depending on what you get. You get your money's worth alone from that. I was absolutely stuffed.   I really like that if you do order the combo, they serve it to you in pots which I've come to learn is SO much better than the tiny bags restaurants usually stuff your seafood in. By letting all the seafood spread out flat inside the pot, it's able to soak in the sauces more and just flesh the flavor out to its max potential!  The urban mix sauce is also my favorite sauce out of all the similar restaurants in the valley. The flavors just meshed together so well and left me wanting more even when I was completely stuffed. I left as a very very happy costumer.   PS: Brownie points for offering frog legs. I haven't seen this appetizer at a restaurant in ages!",

    "text": "So this is a duel review between Hot N Juicy and Smokin' Crawfish.  As you can tell by this review, I'm all in with Team Smokin'.  But isn't it True with life?  Do you want a Hot guy/gal, or do you want a Smokin' guy/gal?!   Told you so!  Time of Visit: Hot - Thursday night around 9pm Smokin' - Friday night around 9pm  Wait time: Hot - For eat in, there were 7 parties ahead of us so we decided to do take away. Smokin' - Lots of room; seated at a booth promptly.  Parking: Hot - small parking lot so we had to park in the dark residential alley akin to Freddie Krueger's neighborhood.  It was a bit scary and we ran for the car. Smokin'- plenty of room in the shopping center.  No sweating or running required.  Service: Hot - Given the wait time, decided to order to go at the to-go counter.  There were 3 staffers there, but no one acknowledged us for a solid 5 minutes.  We didn't even get a \"be with you a minute.\"  Ignored and they didn't care! Smokin' - cast and crew were very attentive... actually beyond attentive.  The tag team waiter and waitress were great, funny, and helpful.  Billy, I can tell you love your job since you are just fab at it.  Price for crawfish: Hot - $11.99/lb Smokin' - $11.99/lb  Quality of crawfish: Hot - tasted frozen and lots of cracked heads.  It's never a good thing to have a crack head.  Most of the crawfish were very small.  Size does matter when it comes to the crawfish. Smokin' - obviously live crawfish, lots of different sizes and heads were all in tact.  Meat had a nice chew.  The Gear Hot - bib and gloves (to go), you provide your own table cloth (I used the hotel laundry bags!) Smokin' - high end paper table cloth, bib and gloves  Poop sack: Hot - Not sure what these crawfish were swimming in, but the pooped sacks were very full of who knows what. Smokin' - Poop sacks not as heinous as Hot and actually most were pretty white as oppose to black.  Seasoning: Hot - Ordered the Hot N Juicy Special in mild.  It had great depth of flavors with different levels of seasoning.  Hot actually wins in this category. Smokin' - Ordered Smokin' Style in mild.  Flavors were good and garlicky, but just a notch below the layers at Hot.  However, my companion thinks Smokin' wins in this category also....  -Sigh- I guess I'll have to come back again and again to taste test.  2nd Date Quality (the come-back factor): Hot - Not even if you treat me like a call girl and paid me. Smokin' - Anytime baby!  Atmosphere: Hot - Hurry up and eat so we can get someone else's a$$ in your chair. Smokin'- Take your time and talk to me.  Also, try to win a lobster from the claw machine while you are at it and Smokin' will even cook it for you.",

    "text": "Been here a few times so this review is overdue! Went here tonight with my brother. Romeo, our server was great! He was attentive and always made sure we had everything we needed. What we ordered:  Cajun fries: I really liked how crispy they were. The only thing I would change is the ability to choose the spice level for them. Comes with a side of ketchup and ranch. Would order again.   Fried soft shell crab: Mmm so good. It's lightly battered and friend to perfection. Has a nice crunch to it! Comes with a side of tartar sauce. Would recommend.   Grilled oysters with dynamite sauce and seaweed: the oysters are broiled with the dynamite sauce on top. The sauce is the same type of sauce that goes over the baked green mussels you get at Japanese restaurants. While this was tasty, I don't think I'll order it again any time soon just because the sauce gets a little heavy afterwards.   The Road combo with blue crab, shrimp, and clams in medium spice Urban Mix sauce: this combo came with 2 red potatoes, 2 corn on cob, and sausages. You guys...the sauce is bomb! Urban mix is a mixture of all their signature sauces (garlic butter, lemon pepper, Cajun, and Louisiana style). I'm in love with the sauce because of the amount of garlic that's put in. You can see the chopped up chunks of garlic in the sauce. Mmm delicious. Medium spice definitely has a kick to it, for me at least. My brother can handle his spice so if it was up to him, he would've asked for Spicy or Smokin' Fire.   Overall, I would come back again. Maybe I'll make my way down the combo menu haha.",

He was very attentive and checked up on us to make sure if everything is okay.   Here's a list of what we ordered:  Fried soft shell crab: my favorite appetizer! Then again I'm a sucker for any fried soft shell crab but this one comes with a side of tartar sauce, would highly recommend it.  Grilled oysters: I am not a fan of oysters whatsoever but I decided to be daring that night and the grilled oysters were actually pretty good and had dynamite sauce over it (the same sauce on the baked green mussels at sushi restaurants). Really liked the grilled oysters and will probably order it again next time.  Cajun fries: really good fries, only wish that I could choose a spicy level for them like at boiling crab  Now onto our meal. We ordered The Road Combo and they allow you to choose certain types of seafood depending on the combo you choose. We chose the The Road Combo with blue crab, shrimp and clams with medium spicy. Sadly my sister can't handle spicy so we had to settle for medium but it was still an okay spicy level. The Combo also came with 2 corn on the cob, 2 red potatoes and sausages. The sauce we chose was the Urban mix which is a mixture of all their sauces. Will definitely be coming back.",

It quickly loses heat once it's out of the bag.   The service has been good each time I've been. I once went during the NBA playoffs and they were very good about changing the channel to the game. I figure if you're in the mood for seafood but wanna watch a sporting event, you'd be pretty happy with this place.   My buddy had a dairy allergy, but she was still able to envoy the lemon pepper(? I think) mix. I called in to verify that it would be safe.   My typical order is a pound of shrimp and a side of rice. I typically peel three or four shrimp, put it into the rice, pour out some sauce into the rice and scoop up the tastiness. Keep doing that until it's all finished.   My one thing: as I said, I'm not that picky been this place, boiling crab, and hot n Juicy, but the catfish basket at boiling crab is definitely the tops, to me, on size alone.",

They raised the prices for the shrimp which wouldn't be bad but the quality of shrimp really fell off. The seasoning used to have loads of garlic and today all 4 of our dishes you couldn't even see garlic pieces. Our Elotes bites looked to be double fried the rice seemed to be old. When we asked for more water instead of bringing a pitcher and filling up our styrofoam cups they just brought another cup what a waste of a cup.  Then they proceeded to eat their own diner with everyone else at the table licking their fingers before grabbing more food for other guests. Not sure we will be back. This used to be a gem to eat at but now I can't recommend anyone to go there.",

Across the street we saw \"Urban Crawfish\" and called to see what their wait was.  Luckily there was no wait and we went across to eat there. The waiter was so nice and helpful. The food was cooked fresh and quick. Everything hot and tasted good, with the exception of the blue crab we ordered. We told the waiter it seemed over cooked and he offered to switch it out for something else. My friend got another pound of shrimp and I just had mine removed from the bill.  I'd definitely be back to eat here again!",

    "text": "We were recommended this place and we wanted to try something new than the other common restaurants similar to this, for example Hot n Juicy. We were there on a saturday noon, and when we walked inside it was pretty slow. At first we were the only customers first. I didnt mind though, I figured its still a bit early for dinner. We were greeted with the most friendly waiter, and the music playing throughout the restaurant was like jazzy classic vibes which I enjoyed. We came at a time where it was happy hour so free domestic beer, whoo!   We started off with fried frog legs with cajun fries for an appetizer. When it came out, everything was super hot and fresh! I had to let the frog legs cool down before the oil burned me. After taking the first bite of the frog legs, you can feel the juices and the oils drip along your mouth, and it was bursting with flavor. It was SO good. The cajun fries to tag along with it, SO GOOD as well. Then we ordered the 3 combo which we chose the shrimp, clams, and crayfish and we got the sauce that had all the sauces combined.  The flavors were amazing, and the spice level was absolutely perfect. I think this place is underrated and definitely should be known more.",

The Cajun fries were not that flavorful at all. Super bland. Had to ask for more Cajun seasoning. The oysters were good. The Street platter was good as well but it was such a small amount for the price compared to other places.   What really turned me off about this place was the amount of plastic waste there was. Every little thing was packaged in little plastic cups ( ketchup, ranch, Cajun spice, cocktail sauce, horseradish,...). I don't understand the need for all these little cups that will end up in landfills and eventually into our oceans where it ends up back on our plate inside the seafood we eat! Water and lemon wedges were also given to us in styrofoam cups.   I was not able to enjoy my meal because of all this waste. Hopefully the owner or management will implement reusable cups and dishes. Not only is this more cost effective for your business but it's will cause less damage to our already deteriorating planet.",

When I arrived it was empty so I was kind of skeptical. I ordered the king crab legs, pound of shrimp, and the battered elote bites as an appetizer. The elotes were super delicious! They are moist and have a little spice to it. The king crab legs were juicy and well seasoned as well as the shrimp. I definitely will be back when I come back to Vegas! The portions are more than reasonable and I was pleased overall!",

I have been to the other places but the wait sometimes sucks and I don't leave the restaurant smelling like what I ate haha.   We also got Kumamoto oysters. They were yummy! I just had to squeeze a little lemon juice and just eat them. Good stuff!  I also love the concept of it being in tray. A lot of sauce evenly distributed. The only bad thing is it gets cold fast if you eat slow. But otherwise awesome! It also comes out with two potatoes, corn, and 6 sausage.",

They have an \"urban mix\" that includes all 4 lemon pepper, garlic butter, Cajun, and Louisiana style. However, can't just do 3 sauces. They'll only let you do one. Lame. I would think that they combine each sauce individually to make the 4 so why the big deal to just have 3? Well my party that got the urban mix said it lacked flavor. Came in on a Saturday evening with no wait, but service was very slow and unprepared. We didn't get any bibs, gloves, or had napkins on the table. We weren't offered bibs or gloves til after all the food was served, which by then some of us started eating already because we were hungry. So, there wasn't any reason for the bibs or gloves since we already got our hands dirty. Please make sure bibs and gloves are offered prior to food delivery. Also, make sure there are napkins. Disappointed that such essential items were not present. Food wasn't served together. Shrimp first then crawfish then sweet potato fries. Why are the fries last? Keep in mind the sweet potato fries were not crispy. In the end, we will not return or recommend this place.",

I ordered the shrimp and they were ... Shrimpy. Probably the smallest sized shrimp I've had among the other places I've tried. Also, half of our party had pretty bad stomach aches the morning after. Their Cajun fries aren't Cajun fries: they're just regular fries with some sprinkles on top. Our waitress was on the slow side but it didn't bother me. However, when it came to splitting our bill, I don't think she understood us. She just separated each guest by order on the same receipt by grouping our orders, but there were no subtotals or separate checks. She also mistakenly put an extra order of an entire bucket of beer. Luckily we were able to catch it before paying. Anyway, this caused a seriously delayed paying process for our group even though we were told our checks were going to be split. I probably wouldn't come back here.",

I'm the kind of person who sits down and eats several pounds of this boiled goodness.....seriously!  Now, this is actually a really good location.  Plenty of parking in a shopping center that is really easy to get to right off of Spring Mountain and Decatur (ironically directly across the street from its competitor).    When you first walk in, the space seems small.  Several booths that sit two comfortably, four it you want to get snuggly with your eating companions.  Two long tables for larger parties, but the benches are permanently placed in the floor, so getting in and out can be a feat of acrobatics and flexibility if there are a lot of you sitting there.  The servers and owner are amazingly friendly and take their time to answer any questions you have.  We had Kevin, and thank you Kevin for all of your help.  Your recommendations were spot on.  And now the food!  Kevin recommended the Kumamoto Oysters, and let me tell you they are a must!  Yes, they are more pricey than the standard Blue Point Oyster, but oh so worth it.  They are perfectly sized in a nice deep shell, texture is phenomenal (no slimy feeling), and very sweet in taste.  for the appetizer, I got the half dozen at today's market price and was not disappointed.    For the main course, I chose 1lb of crawfish (fresh frozen today's market price $7.99/lb), 1lb green mussels (today's market price $9.99/lb), and 1lb of the regular shrimp (today's market price $10.99/lb).  Now, most people come in and do the meal deals, one of which is pick any three of four options a 1lb a piece of crawfish, clams, mussels or shrimp.  The deals come with 2 pieces of corn, 2 potatoes and two sausages.  Being that I am not a fan of corn, potato and sausage, I went with the non-meal deal so not to waste the food.   You get a choice of four different sauces and spice levels.  I went with the Garlic Butter flavor in mild as I am a major wussy when it comes to spiciness.  Ha...it still has a kick!!!  My mouth was on fire by the end of the meal.  I talked to the owner Loan about the flavors, and she explained that the spiciness is what sets them apart from the other crawfish locations, so be aware that it is spicier than what you may be used to.  But oh the flavor!  The Garlic Butter was so flavorful, not overpowering in garlic and not heavy or greasy.    The crawfish was fresh/frozen, but except for their not being a lot of juice to sucks out of the head, you never would have known.  The meat was very sweat and tender.  They were all medium is size, so nothing over cooked, which is a huge problem during the off season.  The green mussels were fresh and tender and very large in size.  And the shrimp were almost melt in your mouth.  So, three pounds of food (which i would like to say I shared, but nope...all me) ad garlic butter cover hands (and arms), and I have decided this is my new go to crawfish place.  It is a little spicier than I prefer, but I think I will get used to it.  The servers are phenomenal and helpful (which really makes a huge difference).  Crafish season will kicking off end of December or early January, and I am waiting to see what happens pricewise.  This place has been open for a little over five weeks, so I will have to wait and see how it fairs in the long haul.",

It's never to busy, the sauces are better and richer than its competitors. Although in the last few months the amount of sauce in the bags of seafood has become less and less. At one point and time I was denied extra sauce on a to go order because they got word of someone trying to duplicate their recipe... Otherwise I like the establishment, I just wish they would be more consistent.",

This probably ranks as my lowest experience with type of place (boiling crab, hot & juicy ect) I asked for a garlic butter and not only did it take forever to come but it came out looking like brown taffy. The shrimp and crawfish were over cooked. I shouldn't have to ask for a bib. Our waitress seemed overworked. Sauce was good. Won't be returning.",

The more expensive seafood is fairly fresh.   Now the negatives: the food was overcooked; the lobster was chewy, the shrimp was chewy. Clams were really not fresh some of them didn't even open up which means they were dead.   We did come on a Thursday at 4:30 so maybe that's why it wasn't the 4.5 star experience that everyone else gave it. But it was good some redeeming qualities but the seafood itself wasn't great it was ok.",

    "text": "Casual and unpretentious, but delivered on the promise of seasoned crab, shrimp and crawfish boil, that took me back to childhood meals of steamed crab or lobster boils served on newspaper with bibs.  They use butcher paper here, but the feel is relaxed and festive at the same time.  We made a reservation for 5:30 since we had a group of 5 or more, but did not need it at 5:30 on Friday. My ten-year-old son was excited to try frog legs and alligator for the first time. Decor is a bit kitschy, but cute, with wooden crawfish or crab traps, restaurant clean and well maintained. Mika greeted us warmly and seated us at a long picnic-style table in her section.  Her service was genuinely warm and friendly with helpful information and suggestions. We had: Corn bites- 5 stars Onion Rings- 5 stars Fried Shrimp -4 stars Etouffe-4 stars Frog legs- I was not a big fan, tho I had liked them at another place years ago-- these were a bit like slimy chicken Alligator- 4 stars tasted like good chicken nuggets with a good spicy sauce Crawfish Po Boy-- I never got a bite but the guys seemed to enjoy King Crab with Urban Mix - 5 stars.  $32 /lb- 2 large legs in spicy sauce. Very good, but in future I will choose a more subtle sauce to go with the delicate king crab, and save the more intense sauce for crawfish or shrimp. Beer and sake selection ok, wine limited to Mondavi Woodbridge Chardonnay and cabernet for $5 glass. attempted the live lobster claw machine in back for $2 a try to get a lobster, which they will cook for you-- which is a fun thing to try. Unless you can get the claw tangled between the legs, the lobsters just slip out.",

I'd have to disagree.... but it's not bad like some of the other places in Vegas.  Pros:  -Menu options are great, especially on the back where you can get large combo platters if you and a friend want to share a variety.  -Menu is pretty clear and easy to understand.  -Lobster claw game at $2 a play is entertaining at best but difficult to grab, lobsters are usually clumped together in the corner -Sauce is not oily like the competition which kept my stomach ache free  Cons: -There was a manager lady who wasn't friendly at all. I was seated by a gentlemen but the lady came by to drop off the menus without a single kind gesture, and didn't even ask if I wanted anything to drink while I wait for my friends. -The sauce is less oil but lacks heavily in flavor. The hot n juicy special is loaded with spices and garlic to give you a delicious kick. The sauce here was spicy but bland -All the seafood is market price and listed on a tiny neon menu in the center of the restaurant. Maybe putting more around the restaurant so people don't have to get up to see it -Shrimp is puny.....  (no pun intended)  Overall: I'd come back with friends but this wouldn't be my go to. I think i'll just stick with my pepto and hot n juicy",

Everyone's pupils dilate with hunger as saliva produces and drips from the mouth. Oh it's an entire EVENT when Cajun food is a part of the daily plan.   Here in Vegas, there aren't many options or locations. I figured I'd try this joint since they had an enticing happy hour oyster deal.   Mm...overall, service from Kevin was GREAT. Food wise, the shrimps were overcooked and small. And the cocktail sauce for the oysters was wayyy tooo thick of a consistency. Almost like a gelatinous and mucous consistency. Not a fan!! Somehow, somewhere we also decided to get the shrimp po boy. As plain as that sandwhich looked, it was probably the best thing on the table. Yum! Cajun fries, always my favorite part, didn't blow me away. I didn't like the Burger King thickness of the fries, and their Cajun seasoning wasnt very Cajun. We asked for more. Sad panda!  Wish I loved this place, but maybe I'll give it another try in the future and have a change of heart.",

They also have daily specials like FRI-SUN FREEEE domestic beer with a purchase of $7. Something like that. That's already so much to offer!   My friend suggested going here because of their dollar oysters, you do have to check in though to be eligible for that deal. Anyway, so my friend and I started with a half dozen each, got our own beers, then ended up getting a pound of shrimp to share.  But anyways we got here around 4 pm today and it was quite empty. There was only about 3 tables so the service was fast. Our server was quirky and funny. Lol.   Our food came quite fast about 15 mins for the oyster and shrimp to come. The oysters were blue point I believe, and they were SUPERBBB!! They were so fresh and just so so yummy (I ended up totaling to a dozen all on my own; my friend ended up with a dozen too). As for the shrimp, we got the urban mix seasoning which is their mixture of all sauces. I noticed that in comparison to Hot n juicy and boiling crab... their sauce was on the sweeter side. They did have a good Cajun seasoning to butter ratio though. I liked it!   That's all we ordered, but some things that stuck out to me when reading the menu was they had fried frog legs, fried alligator, fried rice and seafood spaghetti. I mean, that's a big selection!  I'd have to try that next time when I can bring an extra stomach.   This is a place I can definitely see myself coming to often for the great deals and food!   Oh they also have this claw machine that has lobster in it. If you can it, they cook it! Haha. Didn't get a picture of that though. Next time!",

We came here Becuase of their $1 oysters. Which isn't a bad deal at all. So me and girlfriend purchased 24 pieces (2 Dozen). We were craving oysters that's why.   We also ordered the Road combo which is about $40.95 which included: 1Lb-Shrimp, 1Lb-Crawfish, and 1Lb Clams. Also corn, potato, and Suasages. Our flavor was the Urban Mix which is super good ! Everything tasted fresh.  Overall our experience was outstanding and this place beats other seafood stations in my opinion. We'll be back soon.",

It was pretty late, Everyone in our group was craving seafood but we couldn't find any places that would be open by the time we made the drive out to the locations. I came across urban crawfish and decided to give it a go! Right when you walk in you immediately smell all the goodness that's cooking in the kitchen. We were greeted by one of their friendly staff, they told us it would be a short wait and offered us seats at the bar while we waited for a table to open. Our waiter made it easy to order by giving us pointers on their menu. I got their \"Road combo\" which gave you a choice of 3 types of seafood on their menu, plus sausages, potatoes and corn. It was a bit over $40 bucks, which I thought was a deal!! The amount of food could easily feed 2 people. Overall my family was extremely pleased with the quality and quantity of food, the flavor, atmosphere and staff. Can't wait to be back in Vegas. This will definitely be a spot to comeback to!",

It's a bit pricey but the flavor and the amount of food you get is a good deal and enough for two hungry adults.  Everything from the potatoes, to the corn, and the crabs it's all full of flavor.

The flavor I got was the popular garlic butter/ medium. Both the crawfish and shrimp was really good. The sauce had a good flavor and seemed light and not too heavy. The sausages  I ordered in the bag of crawfish was really good and filling as well. Shiley our waitress provided great customer service! Really friendly and making sure she was there for refills on water or anything else. Overall I had a great experience at this new joint! Everyone should give this place a try!",

Everything came out promptly and tasted good. The sauce was not as spicy as we would of liked but they were quick to resolve it. The lobster was a bit over cooked but good and the service was excellent except for trying to up sell us on everything. Sorry, I don't want to pay 30 bucks for a dozen oysters. The Blue points that we had were delicious.  I would have also like to have won a lobster in the claw game but I didn't. They asked us to do a yelp review and gave us 10% off our bill. It was still 150.00 for three people after the discount. We did order a lot of food though even though we're not fat. I would eat here again, if they make the lobster game easier to win and have a full bar.  Really though- i would eat here again. please have crackers for the oysters next time. thanks! Not the same as HnJ or BC but just as good.",

There were couple shrimps in the batch that seemed really old and nasty. Still I wasn't dissapointed. It can happen right? Finally in the middle of our dinner I found a cockroach next to me on the bench seat. Didn't wanna cause a scene, quietly got an employees attention to get it away. Towards the end I think the  owner came up to me and told me sorry and that it's hard to totally eliminate the bug problem. Told them it was ok. When we finally got the bill they still charged us full price. I should've been comped ice tea, steam rice and maybe corn. Those items are really nothing for them. Just saying.",

    "text": "Experience: My friend had a get-together here on a Saturday at 6pm. There were 14 of us. I have been wanting to try this place as I am a Louisiana gal still trying to find some decent southern or Cajun/Creole cuisine to bring me back home.   Facility:  The restaurant is located in a strip mall. This is a cute, casual place that is fairly small. Our big party sat in the middle on picnic bench style tables. They also had several booths along the walls. The decor is cute with seafood traps scattered around.   Service:  Our waiter was Phil. He was pretty attentive and patient with our big group. They did make a few mistakes on our food, and apologized, but it did make for some people getting their food as others finished. However, I was impressed that all the food came out hot and fresh...I'd rather eat at different times, then bringing it all at once and some food is cold.   Food:  I liked the food. We ordered a ton and there wasn't anything I didn't like.  CRAWFISH - 3.5/5 - I ordered Louisiana Style, the hottest they could make it, with sausage, potato and corn. Ok, for \"frozen\" crawfish in Las Vegas, this was pretty decent. The shells were hard to peel sometimes and the some of the crawfish was a little tough, but it was frozen, and maybe a tad overcooked. But the flavor was good. I even liked the andouille, and that's rare in this town.  CATFISH - 4/5 - I liked the catfish. It was steaming hot, and battered well with cornmeal. The tarter was good, so I enjoyed this dish.  FROG LEGS - 4/5- Surprisingly, these were pretty good. They were battered well, and came out hot!  They were a little bland, but I like the tarter sauce on them anyway.  ALLIGATOR - 4/5 - These were good...small bites that were battered perfectly and came out pipping hot. We ordered this Cajun spiced, but I didn't really taste much spice. Again, I love this in tarter sauce.  COCONUT SHRIMP - 4/5 - I really liked the flavor on the batter of these. Perfect balance of coconut.  SHRIMP - 3/5 - I tasted my friend, and she ordered it Smokin style at the spiciest. It was good, but just too much garlic for me.  CAJUN FRIES - 5/5 - The fries came out hot and fresh every time. The portions were big and everyone devoured these.   Overall:  Much better than the other Crawfish place.  I'm not expecting crawfish like home, because this is not Louisiana, but I would come back here again. Plus all the fried foods were very good and all came out pipping hot! Plus they have beer! :D",

The food came out fast and the seasoning was really delicious!!! They even gave us extra seasoning for our Cajun fries. This place is only three months old so give them a try! We're so glad we did! They give you gloves too. They have subtitles on the TVs! I watched the republican debate and actually knew what was going on! The environment at this place is really poppin! Oh and fyi! They'll have cappuccinos and boba soon! They have a deal right now where if you buy a bucket of beer, you get 2 free bottles! So in total you get 8 for $25 bucks! Anyways, I'm done writing a book lol just go try this place out. They hella good. Music is poppin. So many good throw backs got me jammin out.",

Seeing they're opened late til 11pm which gave me a little less than an hour to check the place out.   Walking in I had the cool bar vibe which was cool. Our waitress was super friendly and explained how their menu works. She sold us on their deal on the back of their menus.   Everything was pretty good. The flavor was lacking just a little but it was still enjoyable. For a party of 2, we got 3 lbs worth of crawfish, mussels, and shrimp (plus 2 potatoes, 2 corn, and 6 sausage slices) for about $40 I believe it was.  Overall, I was satisfied. Got my seafood craving taken care of and I had great customer service the entire time.",

We ate at hot and juicy crawfish last year. This place was leaps and bounds better! I don't remember our server's name. He was a young man, very polite and professional. We started with the Cajun calamari and Cajun alligator. Both delicious. We ordered 3 pounds of fresh live crawfish with the house sauce. Also amazing. Will be coming here again next year.

So after speaking with a manager \"Kim\" I was promised a comp on the house for our next visit which would be our original order from our bad experience ; however the story changed once I called to place my order.

    "text": "I went here for the first time yesterday for lunch and I was pretty excited to get the deal for $1 oysters. You can buy 6 or 12 at a time.   I'm usually skeptical about trying other crawfish places that aren't hot n juicy or boiling crab because they're never as satisfying. I got a lb of live crawfish for $11.99. I chose mild \"smokin' style\" which is a mixture of all the sauces.  I like my food spicy but I thought the mild was a lil spicier than I usually prefer. The sauce had great flavor. I wouldn't say it's better than HNJ only because I love the garlicy flavor there. I do love the chunks of garlic in the sauce here though and I love that they give u a wide tin pan to dump the crawfish in so the sauce is easier to scoop up.   We were the only customers during lunch. I couldn't stop thinking about how good the crawfish was, mainly because how big they were! I had to go out and get more crawfish for dinner the next day. I decided to go to Boiling Crab only because it was a little closer. I drove by and saw all of the people waiting so I decided to check out Smokin' Crawfish for dinner. I was in luck! There were only 2 other tables in there (big groups). No wait!   I chose extra mild this time and the spice level was good. I also got to taste the corn. This is the first time I had a sweet corn in my crawfish boil. And yet again, the crawfish were huge! Loved that!  I've had awesome service each time I came. This place is great!",

Would have loved to get more horseradish, as per dozen it was just a small dab.  The seafood sauce was good, and squeeze of lemon.  We ordered a ROAD combo.  Got crawfish, Shrimp and Clams.  Got the urban mix, with mild spice. I appreciate that the owner told us that even super mild spice, it will still be spicy because of the cajun spice.  The food came out pipping hot in a bag, with 2 corn, 6 sausages and 2 potatoes.  The potatoes were nice and soft, can be easily broken up using your hands.  The corn soaked up all the sauce, and it was really good.  I was worried it would be too salty, but it had the right amount of tang, spice, sweetness.  The sausage was really good, nice smokey flavour.  Now the seafood, the crawfish were good.  It was our first time having crawfish, so I don't know if they're considered fresh or not.  The heads were quite big, so kinda sucks that you only eat the small tails, but they were pretty good.  The clams were very meaty and big.  not sandy at all, and soaked up the sauce nicely.  The shrimp on the other hand were not fresh.  The meat were mushy when you tried to peel it.  I just threw some away, as I didn't want to risk any illness.  There were maybe 5-6 mushy shrimp in the batch.  Otherwise, the shrimp were very nice size.    Quite the experience, nice and quiet and not too many customers, which was nice.  Will try boiling crab or hot and juicy next time to compare the difference.",

I ordered a pound of crawfish and a pound of shrimp in their urban mix with medium level spicy. The fresh crawfish was average size for $14/lb and you get about 25 shrimp for $14/lb. I didn't haven't any of the shrimp but my companion really enjoyed it. I was all about the crawfish - it was fresh and perfectly boiled.  Service was friendly and quick.   For those interested in testing out your lobster catching skills, the claw machine is straight back near the restrooms.",

The alligator was good, but my gf said it was a little too salty.   I ordered the fried shrimp basket with Cajun fries and it came with around 5 shrimp. It was okay nothing spectacular. Cajun fries were good but I've had better.  My gf had the catfish basket. She said you can't really get catfish wrong lol. So I'm assuming it was good.   I would definitely go back to try the boil but for the fried foods it wasn't anything I'd rave over.",

Mind you this location is a lot more smaller than all the other places but it was super busy when we came in. (We came in with a group  at 7pm on a sunday night)  Food was amazing!!! And the staff was EXTREMELY nice despite how busy and hectic they were!!!  Whoever was the guy who took our order literally got every single thing on point without even writing it down he just stood there and listened and he got it all down to every detail (i was with my fam and everyone couldnt agree on what to get on one point and kept changing details on the order) but damn he got it on lock down.  Also the manager, she was extremely hospitable. And busy. She got the whole place on lock down juggling everything at the same time. Now that's how you run a business. All of the staff we encountered were extremely nice and  accommodated every request we did despite on how busy it was. Really no issue here, they definitely need to expand to a bigger space and hire more people. I will definitely come back and recommend this place",

    "text": "Came here for the first time a couple of weeks ago after passing the place for months we decided to try it out.. The seafood prices was more expensive then boiling crab and hot n juicy which was a big surprise for me. But no mind that, the quality of the food was really good - their sauces is what i judged mostly because i'm a HUGE fan of all the spices and garlic of cajun/creole culture. It has some kick to it but was somewhat sweeter than other sauces i've tried. (The sauce i got was all 4 sauces mixed together called Urban Mix) it's something you have to try at least once.  I gave this place a 3/5 because of lack of customer service. When we came in a guy was being trained and there was a lady behind him correcting every little thing he said and to be honest he wasn't bad at all. He was very nice and did a good job.. I just wished it didn't happen when we were eating because it really throws off the environment and literally made it so awkward since she looked rude to him too. And also my crawfish barely had meats on them.. they were TINY tails.   This place is a good alternative to boiling crab and hot n juicy for my opinion if you don't want to wait in line and want some quick seafood or just want something a little different/diverse. Their menu selections was really good - they had large combos in the back of the menus and food ranging from gumbo, etouffee, Fried soft shell crabs, Hibachi Shrimp fried rice, to seafood spaghetti. Wow.. this was probably the most diverse menu i've seen for a seafood boil restaurant. I'll be back to try the gumbo, poboys, for sure and some other things i'm eyeing lol.   We got seated right as we came in and the interior was very adorable with crab cages decorations and a real lobster claw machine!! It was clean and spacious! The concept is the same as other places.. a huge wax paper on the table, bibs, and food in a bag. They serve all the food in a pan which is genius because it's less cleaning and more organized!  What we ordered:   -Road Combo $42: Picked Blue crab (2), Mussels, and shrimp.. came with corn, sausages, and potatoes.. pretty good  -Crawfish $12: Live crawfish with urban mix.. crawfish BARELY have any meats on them :(   -Hibachi Shrimp fried rice: Completely disgusting!! it tastes SO fishy and smelt like it too it's like a strong odor that not other shrimp fried rice should have and tastes awful   -Sweet potatoes fries: Good but not worth $5 and they don't give you a ketchup bottle like other places do..  ..Overall a pretty pleasurable experience but i'll defiantly come back for their good menu varieties!",

There's hardly ever a line (maybe a 5 minute wait on the weekends) and the waitresses and waiters are always great here. Has a flavor similar to Hot n Juicy (but way better!), I wouldn't say its flavor is comparable to Boiling Crab. Market price for shrimp is around $14/lb last time I went which is the current average. They have many spice options and flavors. I always get mild garlic butter and it's soooo yummy.",

The waiter showed up pretty quickly to line our table with paper... just Incase we were to order crab or any shellfish that might've made a mess and out menu. It took him forever to come and take our order. After finally getting our order... it took him a while to bring back some hot sauce that I requested.

    "text": "Apparently Crab/crawfish boils are super popular and 2 other ones were over an hour wait. Urban crawfish had no wait and a lot of open tables. Seeing the good reviews on yelp and no wait, my husband and myself were super excited!  The place wasn't super busy, but wasn't dead. There was about 7 tables total that were occupied when we got there. A party of 6 were seated right after us. The waitress was very nice and friendly but unfortunately was slow in getting drink orders as well as coming back to the table to get our order. However she was running around, but it was hard to understand as there were multiple other employees there and we weren't getting service. The table of 6 must have gotten tired of waiting because they left.  When our waitress came to take our order (again, she was friendly, just maybe the restaurant was poorly staffed) we ordered (i dont know what it is called) the appetizer that was basically street corn that was fried. When we got it, it was not good. I would not recommend or ever order these again. The ranch that was served with them were awful!  For our main course we ordered a shrimp boil bag with 1lb King Crab, 1lb Green Muscles, 1lb or Crawfish, 2 corn, 2 potatoes & sausage. We ordered it with medium spice and cajun seasoning. The seasoning was on point and the spice level was perfect! The Muscles were not on point. They were decent, but not the best. The crab was good, and the crawfish were ok as well. Nothing Mind blowing. But good.  Unfortunately, we didn't even get out of the parking lot before my stomach started rocking. I am in NO way saying it was food poisoning. But i was sick with an upset stomach (I'll leave some of the details out) for 3 days!  Maybe we will go back and get better service and try something else. They had a lot of po-boy sandwiches that looked delicious.",

    "text": "We just had the best seafood dining experience at this place yesterday. This place is similar to Boiling Crab and Hot and Juicy Crawfish but 10x better. We had the Street combo which you can get 3 items and it comes with 2 corn and 6 sausages for under $63.95. We had the Dungeness crab, a pound of shrimp, and a pound of mussels with the Urban Mix sauce. That is a lot of food for the price and should be enough to feed 4 people. When they brought it out, they had it in a bag which most Creole seafood restaurants do but then they pour it in a pan. I thought it was easier to pick out your food that way than digging into a plastic bag. Everything was so fresh and flavorful! We also had their fried oysters which were bigger than a chicken nugget. Twice bigger in size than what we get from Boiling crab.  Just so plump and juicy! It was only $8.99 and comes with fries.   The server that we had was so friendly and efficient. She kept checking up on us and refilling our drinks and and making sure we had enough limes for our dipping sauce. I have to have my lime, salt, and pepper   She also gave us free ice cream for dessert.   The quality of food, service, and price is much better than their competitors in my food fanatic opinion Overall experience was great and will def be back for more. They have happy hours specials too. Oyster for $1 and domestic beer for $2.",

They have really random stuff like an array of boba, frog legs, fried etole balls.  Their customer service is great. Haven't been to hot n juicy or boiling crab since to avoid the wait!   It's super clean, and reasonably priced with a good rewards system (although I haven't gone back to redeem anything yet)   Highly recommend especially if you're caught waiting in line or in the awfully though out parking lot at H&J one day (sorry for the shade, not sorry)",

And I got my food at 10:40pm. There was one big table ( looks like owner's friends) and one other table. ( they came later than my table but they got food faster than us)  After that, I was about to ask a check to owner but she didn't answer at all so I decided to walk to her to get a check.  Ridiculous part is she smiled to other table and handed to them and tell thank,plz come back again. But she just threw the check to my table without saying anything Okay bye I will never come back",

I've had frog leg, crab, crawfish, oysters, and the last time my wife had salmon and surprisingly she said it was one of the best salmon she's had and she's actually pretty picky.  I believe the owner works there as well and you can see the care that comes when the owner is there working.  It's been consistently great. We've even order several pounds to go and take it with us on the plane back to Utah.  Do yourself a huge favor and give this little gem a try.  I know for sure in no time there's going to be a huge wait when the secret is out!",

    "text": "Our first time trying cajun seafood in bags was across the street from Urban Crawfish at H&J. Don't get me wrong, I love H&J and when I came back home to the Midwest and tried other places like this, nothing was comparable to H&J!  I found Urban Crawfish on Yelp and it had amazing reviews for being new. So I told my husband I would bookmark it and the next time we are in Vegas, we should stop here to see what the hype is about. It was definitely comparable to H&J, but I felt the flavors that Urban Crawfish were much better! It's just something about their Urban mix that makes it delicious! It has some asian tastes to it as well, maybe that's why I like it better? I mean H&J does too and I'd go to both, but if I had to choose, I'd go with Urban Crawfish.  Their prices aren't bad either. My husband and I always share a bag because I mainly eat the shrimps, clams, and mussels. Between the two of us, it's like $40 before tip and tax.  I will also give them a 5 Star because they were short staffed and super busy one night when we went in March. We waited nearly an hour for our food and the server came to tell me there was a mishap and our food didn't get put through the system and it would take another 30 mins. I was not having that and let them know..the manager apologized and gave us 50% off our bill. Kudos for caring about your customers.",

We said yes and we are glad he offered to open the bag for us cause we would have made a mess and wouldn't have turn out good. The urban mix was delicious!

We both ordered the $40 package which gives you the option of 3 items from their 5 item list and you get 1lb of each.   I got the clams, mussels, and shrimpies My Gf got the crawfish, mussels  and shrimpies   We ordered fried alligator, cajun fries, and dynamite baked mussels also  ..   Everything was pretty good except I wasn't a fan of the dynamite baked mussels (the sauce was a bit bland) and it was our first time trying the alligator, but it tasted a bit \"fishy\"   We were huge fans of the clams and will probably come back for those !   All in all it was a different atmosphere and we will probably come back .. Depending on what we are craving.",

I got the snow crab legs in the mild Smokin' Style sauce and it was better than expected! Some reviews mentioned that the sauce is not flavorful and nowhere near BC/HnJ level so I was a little worried going in. The sauce does taste a bit different than BC/HnJ and less oily but it's just as good if not better than the other two (I know, I never thought I would ever say that!). My boyfriend got the Shrimp and Crawfish Po Boy and he really enjoyed it as well.  Added bonus, there was no wait when we got there on a Saturday night around 7:30! Our waiters Nicole and Billy were super nice and constantly checked up on us to see if we needed anything.",

The shrimp by the pound didn't look like a pound to me, but I guess I just wanted more? lol   We also ordered oysters for $1 each since it was happy hour. The oysters were small.  The spicy is not that spicy, if I go back i will get the hottest.  Also didn't really like their corn it tasted funny to me.  There is a stench when you walk to the restrooms, I think its the lobster machine.  If you can catch a lobster for $2, they will cook it for you. I do not recommend doing that... the lobsters look old and thats probably why it stinks so bad around there.",

My family went there on Christmas eve around 6:00pm. She told us that we have to wait about an hour. when we finally sat down at the table( right next to dirty restroom)  and ordered some foods. I realized, why there was an hour wait time even  there wasn't much customers waiting  in the place. They didn't know how to operate the restaurant at all.  We ordered seafood combo #2 with medium spice, house fried rice, alligator fries, steam corn, steam rice. It took forever to receive the foods and They totally forgot our rice and corn, never brought them until we finished all the  foods. When I remind her for them, she said I have to wait another 15min for steam corns.  The  seafood combo was lack of flavor.  House fried rice was too salty and fried alligator was choppy little pieces of trash.( worst out of three ) I was really upset about their poor service and their food quality. I just cannot believe why this place received these good reviews. Did they paid people to write good reviews?  When I complained about the service, she gave me the discount but I rather pay full price with  good service and good quality of food. I wasted my valuable holiday time and money with my family at the terrible restaurant.",

Very modern and cozy restaurant with absolutely amazing food and friendly staff. Loan, one of the owners, helped us with our choices. She perfectly explained differences between different styles of their sauces for seafood.   My parents and I loved the place. Next time I travel to Vegas, the Smokincfawfish will be in my visit list.   The restaurant only 5 weeks old and they are doing great job already.

More than expected, the food was extraordinarily good. The live oyster was super fresh, the sauce came with it was amazing. The shrimp was the best part, they made sure it wasn't overcooked, it was just right. The crawfish was very fresh as well and it could get VERY spicy. We came back the day after that. The owner was very sweet too!  P/S. Their price is very reasonable compared to other crawfish places in LV ($7.99/lbs of crawfish vs. $11.99/lbs at Hot and Juicy)",

PEOPLE: everyone was very friendly and the owner took the time to chat with us after we told her it was our first time trying crawfish (they don't have them in Canada). she also taught us how to eat them haha, I can see this place with lines out the door next time we are in vegas.",

    "text": "Excellent first time meal there tonight. We got there about 4:30 so happy hour was still in. The place was sparsely attended but that's what we wanted. We got good attention from the waiter/trainee, management and the cooks.   Got 6 perfect oysters on ice at $1.00 each for an appetizer. Domestic beer was $2.00. We had no idea how good the oysters would be. They were fresh, sweet, not a hint of fishy and absolutely delicious. I am not a fan of raw oysters but I ate 4 of them and actually enjoyed chewing them. Heretofore I have only made a pretense of chewing and simply swallowed. These were really that good!  My husband had the catfish basket and I had the oyster basket. The catfish was in filets and man, were they good. The oysters were the best I have eaten anywhere, bar none. I can put down some oysters if they are fried. These were perfect! I am gluten sensitive and had no repercussions from eating the breading which leads me to think it is mostly, if not all, cornmeal, with very little flour. Heads-up IBS sufferers! I would have ordered 6 more fried oysters but they were out. So we got 6 more raw oysters.  The baskets were served with cajun fries, which we had, or we could have had sweet potato or waffle fries for a small up-charge. The fries were so good, crispy outside, hot hot hot inside with a nice cajun seasoning sprinkled over. We brought the leftover fries home, that's all that was left on our table.  Condiments were all fresh and cold in separate lidded containers, even the mixture of salt and pepper. I am very leary of not-perfectly-fresh tartar sauce after an acute attack of food poisoning from eating it years ago. I had no qualms about any of these sauces.  Will we go back! YES! Will we recommend it to friends, YES! Great food, good prices! What is not to like? Next time we're trying the seafood boils with friends.",

It even smelled good. What is cool about this place is that they have a lobster claw machine, where if you were able to grab it, you could win the lobster and they would cook it for free.   I wanted to order half a pound of shrimp with a side of rice and French fries. I usually do half a pound of shrimp because I can't finish a pound of shrimp when eating with rice. When I got my order she gave me a pound of shrimp. This got me very confused because I ordered only half. Then she told me that they don't sell half a pound and only by the pound. The server never told me that. And I asked her if I could return the rice then. Thankfully the manager was very nice about it and said the rice would be free. And apologized about the confusion. The sauce is okay, they don't give enough. I had to ask for more sauce. The sauce costed extra but didn't charge me because of the whole shrimp confusion.   After my whole experience, I realized I still like boiling crab better. The employees are nice but the food is mediocre.",

No doubt that neither one of them is bad or better than the other, they have their own flair or twist and everyone is entitled to their own opinion.  My first time experience here was awesome. My BF and I were very impressed with the ambiance and food. Our server tonight was Billy. (Whuddup Big Pimpin'!!! Haha) He's a very cool dude. The food... Let's begin. Haha  Taste wise different and good. I liked how I'm able to get lobster in a combo meal! I think that was the plus for this place that they had choices for combos but now they all do it... haha. It's a little bit cheaper than HNJ so that's worth it too. The place is roomy and bathroom was clean (it grosses me out when places I eat at have dirty bathrooms)",

We flavored our combo medium spicy with a mixture of all 4 of their signature flavors ( Garlic Butter + Louisiana + Lemon Pepper +Cajun ). This created the most savory flavor, which I ended up getting some steamed rice to enjoy the broth with.  The food was fresh, jumbo and quality. The price point is very fair, nothing is overly priced. The restaurant has a nice aura as well, everyone was so friendly and my waiter was a sweet heart.

Eating here was like having a religious experience. Yes, the food was that good. I ordered crawfish with the urban mix @ medium spicy with the smoking fire sauce on the side. The sauce was so flavorful and amazing; I don't even know how to describe it in words. It's something you must experience for yourself. Warning: be prepared for a euphoric moment as you taste this sauce for the first time....and the second time....and every single time after that.  Continuing on, I prefer when the sauce is thick and not extremely liquid-y, so I was very satisfied with the consistency here. The smoking fire sauce I got on the side had ghost peppers in it. I was sweating but it was so flavorful, I couldn't stop dunking my crawfish in it. I regret nothing.  The Cajun fries we ordered were also amazing. I can honestly say it was the best fries I've had at any crawfish place. Each fry was perfectly crispy and light on the inside. Also, another amazing thing about this place: the service. The servers were so great and they gave us free rainbow sherbet ice cream, yet another amazing thing about this place. I'm coming back either today or tomorrow. MY NEW NUMBER ONE CRAWFISH SPOT!  P.S. Please, never change   P.P.S. I'm serious. Don't change, okay?",

Everything was small and kind of mushy. I think the shrimp was $13.50 a pound but we got the combo special that gets you 3 pounds of seafood with potatoes and sausage for under $45.  I also thought the service was lacking. Whenever I place a takeout order at Boiling Crab or H&J, they are super on it and make sure to pack everything for you and ask if you need anything else.  It seemed like I was asking for too much when I asked for a table cover and extra lemons here.   HOT TIP: this place seems to be open on major holidays so if you need a seafood spot to grub at, here ya go!",

During my last visit we came in on a Friday afternoon and there was only two other tables being occupied. As an appetizer I ordered Cajun fries, they came out quickly and were fresh out of the fryer. They were hot but sooo delicious! I also ordered \"The Street\" with lobster, shrimp and mussels. The lobster and shrimp were cooked perfectly but the sauce (Urban Mix Medium)wasn't my all time favorite. The potatoes, corn and sausages were all tasty.

Since Urban Crawfish is rated high on yelp and there is a wait at Hot n Juicy, we decided to give Urban Crawfish a try.  Unfortunately, they did not have live crawfish (in another month or so).  - Crawfish Etoufee - added crawfish tails and definitely taste frozen.  Flavor of the etoufee was good. - Fried Soft Shell Crabs - frozen so after a bite, though the batter was nice a crispy, there was way too much water that came out of the soft shell crabs. - Oyster po boy - the baguette itself was quite delicious.  Was soft but strong enough to hold shreds of iceberg lettuce, slices of tomatoes, and hefty amount of fried oysters.  I enjoyed it very much and when I want oyster poboy, I will get it here. - cajun fries - piping hot and crispy on the outside.   Service was great, and yes, the restroom is very clean.  I will be back for the live crawfish.",

I came in here and waited to be seated. Nobody greeted us so I went to the bar and asked for a seat. The waitress points at an empty table. We sat down and waited a few minutes before the same waitress came to take our drink orders.   We came here 1.5 hours before closing. The place isn't packed, it was a Wednesday night.   I really wanted some Cajun while I was in Vegas but this place ruined my last night here.   I did get up to complain, it's ridiculous of a wait.  Our waitress who was NO WHERE to be found.

Our lead server was phenomenal with getting the orders correct, keeping the drinks fresh and the table cleared.  The kitchen was good with getting our huge variety of orders out timely and didn't miss anything.  At the end we asked for one bill, then everyone changed their mind and wanted separate bills. smh..lol but our server didn't flinch and took care of everything, excellent.  Urban Shrimp: I went with the 1 lb market price shrimp which was $12 that evening.  I went with the Urban Mix sauce: Garlic butter, lemon pepper, cajun and Lousiana style with a spice level of 'spicy'  I threw some corn (tracer rounds) in there with a side of rice and this was a treat.  Shrimp was perfect as was the sauce.  I sampled everyone's dishes as well and the calamari was solid and a great appetizer.  Urban Ambiance:  Casual seafood restaurant decor with wooden tables and benches everywhere for the messy eating.  There's a bar for single eaters like myself on many nights.   This might be my new go to place when I'm fiending crawfish and shrimp.  The service and the food is excellent for what you pay for and I was surprised there wasn't a wait this visit.  We'll hit up the crawfish next visit but that's another Yelp tale.  Enjoy!",

I order 1 lb. of King Crab Legs, a bowl of rice, and wings as an APPETIZER (I'll come back to that). My crabs legs arrived first which was weird cuz I ordered an appetizer to eat BEFORE my meal. The amount of crab legs I received seemed quite small. Usually at hot n Juicy, I receive about 4 legs. I only got 2 and they said it's based on \"weight\". I said okay that's fine. I'm not tripping about the quantity that much BUT they taste so funny. Like they we're over cooked. I barely touched them.   I basically just ate my rice. When wings that came 15 minutes after I received my main entree, were so gross. They said they cook them \"fresh\" but ummmm they also were not good. I was hoping that the songs would redeem them from the horrible crab legs. How do you mess chicken wings???  So, I'm never gonna coming back here. I tried it.",

So you pay for market price for the shellfish per pound but you can add in sides such as potatoes, corn, sausage, etc. Most of the group ordered the shrimp.   Also next time I want to choose the mixture of all 4 of their signature flavors ( Garlic Butter + Louisiana +Cajun+ Lemon Pepper). I also noticed they have Fried Alligator and Fried frog legs.  The service was ok. The music was good and the restaurant was clean.",

I felt like the sauce was kind of watered down or something. It didn't have the rich, thick, juicy taste.. I still prefer Hot n Juicy. But I can honestly say I'd choose this over Boiling Crab.",

The location is a little ways from the strip but not far and totally worth the short trip if you are visiting (and think of it, if it was on the Strip it would cost twice as much and be half as good). We shared the Smokin' Deal #2 with all the sauce flavors mixed together, and we got it with Snow Crab, Crawfish, and Shrimp. Plus of course it comes with the Sausage, Corn, & Potatoes.  It was absolutely delicious and we would get the same thing again. I'm not easy to please when it comes to seafood and crab in particular... I am from Washington state, I grew up with the freshest of the fresh! So I can barely stand places like Joe's Crab Shack and Bubba Gump's. But this place was LEGIT!!! So fresh and good and the sauce... amazing! We can't wait to come back. Thank you guys :)",

He's really into customer service, extremely helpful with the menu, and helped with anything me and my friend needed. He told us his favorite menu item was a special they had which was the baked oysters with some type of cheesy sauce on it and a bit of seaweed, IT WAS AMAZING! Now onto the other foods:  We ordered the street combo of lobster, crawfish and shrimp; along with the house fried rice and two coconuts. The flavoring we had was a combination of all the different spices called the urban mix, and our level of spiciness we had was mild; if you want to make it more spicy you could add more spices on the side as well. The crawfish and shrimp were really good, but the lobster was the best part of our meal! The lobster was what filled us up the most, put a little lemon and lime on it mmmmmm so good. All the time while eating our house fried rice, which included in it shrimp and crawfish. The coconuts were young and freshly cut open for the drinking, then after our meal we ended with eating the coconuts!   Compared to other crawfish places, me and my friend agree that this is the best service and is more filling than the others. We are definitely returning to Urban Crawfish Station! Hopefully Billy is our server again, and I hope the oysters will be there too.",

After finding that Boiling Crab was still closed mid-drive on Flamingo, I turned to Yelp in my time of need and it came through with this gem!  Our service was stellar and she didn't miss a beat. We all ordered our shrimp with their Smokin' sauce and this sauce ranked pretty high for me! It doesn't have the saltiness that Boiling Crab has and the shrimp was perfectly done -- meaning that the shell didn't stick and the shrimp had just the right texture.  You can dump your shrimp out of the bag and eat on a rimmed silver plate. Wish it was a bowl as I feel like it's easier to swirl my shrimp around but I made do!  Sauce spice for my fiancee and I was medium and it was just right. Not as potent as what we've had before but we could definitely taste it. Of note: their \"extra extra mild\" was great for my mom, who's super sensitive to spice. Add the dollar oyster deal they have for their happy hour and you've got a very, very solid & satisfying Cajun seafood spot in Vegas for everyone. Will definitely be back when I'm visiting family again!",

Recently took three friends with me and wasn't able to give them the experience I typically thought I would receive. Upon arriving it took the waiter about 5 minutes to come up to us and extremely long for her to bring us the drinks not a problem but the attitude was horrible. Upon ordering I know we ordered extra rice and when receiving the meal I said I think I ordered two she rudely interrupted me and said \" no actually you ordered one\" never offered refills had to continually ask for favors it felt like she didn't want to wait our table. Brings the meal to the table and I had to ask for splitters after assuming she would come ask if we needed forks missing anything refills .. nothing .. Spending over 100$ for a meal to feel uncomfortable and unwelcomed I don't think I'll be coming back or recommending anymore.",

Now the serve started off good, but when it came time to pay, we sat there almost an extra 25mins,  the server was busy doing something at the register, he stood there a long time, then another server had to get his attention and told him the guest at another table was waiting to order, he run there apologizing, but he NEVER came back to our table.

Their prices are relatively similar to hot and juicy. 12 dollars for a pound of shrimp I believe. Their sauce I think actually have more flavor though. The color is deeper and richer, and the seasoning pops more compared to the other crawfish chain. However, boiling crab is still my favorite because of their thick sauce. Though urban crawfish station does have some good spicy, salty, earthy flavors, it's still too watery. I prefer if it had more chunks in it where you can really like it on the shrimp. Corn is delicious as always!  The sweetness balanced the spicy salty shrimp really well.   The service is nice. It doesn't get too crowded and there's plenty of parking. I think I would definitely come back again!",

Location is in an awkward corner of a plaza, but interior is nicely decorated with a seaside theme- I like their entryway, and their lobster-claw-catch game. Plus they have beer and sake, as well as a few TVs to watch a game while you're there.  We had a pound each of shrimp and crawfish, with potatoes, sausage, and corn, in their Smokin' Sauce (a combination of all of their seasonings), at medium heat. Their heat scale is a bit more relaxed than other places, but the flavors were good. Crawfish and shrimp were nicely sized, but I really liked their fried softshell crab basket the most- perfectly cooked, nicely crisp and seasoned crab, over a generous bed of Cajun fries, for $12. Huge dinner for two, total with tax under $50.  TIP: they offer 10% off during their grand opening with Yelp check in- but only Mon-Wed, between noon and 4PM, so pop in for a weekday lunch if you want to save a few bucks, but their pricing is fair compared to other spots in town.",

    "text": "Was feeling seafood for my birthday but wanted to try something a little different than popular places like boiling crab and hot n' juicy. We also had a fairly good amount of people in the party so I looked for places with the best prices/options. Like hot n' juicy, this place has family style order options but more value in it, such as more pounds of seafood and higher quality seafood for a slightly cheaper price. The options looked amazing so I booked the reservation and gave it a try!   We went on a Thursday night so it wasn't crowded at all (although it should be, was shocking that it wasn't). Hospitality was wonderful! The waitresses were very kind, attentive, and helping of our needs. Especially Kim, our main waitress. She also had a great sense of humor.   On to the food, it was all delicious! We picked just the right flavors and everything tasted fresh. We got the regular and Kumamoto oysters. I am still longing for more of those. We picked 2 of the biggest family size orders. The clams, king crab, and snow crab were killer! Although it was all tasty, those just stood out more to me. One order we mixed garlic butter and lemon pepper with mild spice. The other was the urban mix with mild as well. Both were delicious, just depends on what you feel like more. Feeling a little more spice then I'd go with the urban mix. We also got calamari and a few orders of shrimp fried rice. Everything was perfect and great together! I will definitely be going again and more often. This is going to be my new, go-to for this kind of seafood!",

The right touch of sweetness, garlic, and spices makes this the \"WOW\" factor for me! The \"Garlic Butter\" is another must try! Don't let the name fool you! It's unlike any other garlic butter!   This place definitely has the edge over other competitors for me. The friendly atmosphere and great food surely made a lasting impression!

I had very high hopes after reading all the five star reviews about great service and better food than boiling crab/hot n juicy, especially considering it's one of the few places with alligator meat which was the original reason for going.  The Cajun fries were not as spicy and a little sweet, the shrimp did not come with very much sauce and the sauce that was there was quite bland. The popcorn alligator was more breading than meat. Sorry but hot n juicy and boiling crab have better food.  As far as service, nothing unpleasant other than she assumed one of the drink orders and gave us all waters. The girls at hot n juicy are much cuter, more accommodating and attentive.",

So my husband and I jumped into this place totally by Yelps comments.  We are both on a diet so we had to go in with no carbs in mind.    We both ordered shrimp garlic and Louisiana style flavoring.  Mind you we walked by two other ladies eating a taster of everything.  Chicken wings, crawfish, shrimp, lobster, mussels and so much more with corn on the cob and French fries.  It looked so heavenly.    As I said before, we ordered only shrimp with some tasty flavoring.  The Resturant had wax paper down, brought bibs, brought plastic gloves a pie pan with a bag full of deliciousness.  We shook our bag poured it out on the pie pan and went to town with our 15 pieces of shrimp at 14.99$ a plate.  We peeled and carefully tasted all of our shrimps like we were Jesus and it was our last supper.  The flavor was so tasty spicy but not to.  Messiest meal I have ever indulged in but worth every bit of bite?  The menu was short and sweet. Lots of options.  The waitress Kim greeted us like we were old pals.  Great personality excellent service. Prices were not too bad.  Let me brag again about the taste.  I can not wait to take friends there next time.",

A full 100 Yelp reviews for this restaurant provide a very different side to their 4.5 star review average. (Yelp Grade Inflation is a real problem, people!)    Here is my take on my visit to Urban Crawfish this summer through the voice of excerpts from the reviews of fellow Yelpers:  Cherilyn, 2/28/16: \"Waitress joked about spitting in our food!!\"  Kellee, 6/8/16: \"Waitress attitude was unacceptable and unprofessional. There are too many places in Vegas to be treated foul by someone.\"   Sheila, 6/30/16: \"Waitress threw the check to my table without saying anything.\"  Sylph, 5/26/17: \"The most obnoxious service I've ever had.\"   Elle, 3/27/17: \"The woman who appeared to be the owner was incredibly rude. Our waitress had a bad attitude to everyone...\"  Natai, 3/31/17: \"Waitress seemed very unhappy with her job...she got upset because I didn't know if I wanted tartar sauce or cocktail sauce.\"  Ty, 7/21/17: \"Waitress has an awful bedside manner. She really should quit her job and find another profession more suited to her less-than-charming personality.\"  Brandon, 7/5/18: \"We were spoken rudely to by the nasty young lady that 'greeted' us...I'll happily pay a little extra just for a little courtesy.\"  Chelsea, 7/16/18: \"Our server was kissing her boyfriend in the open...she banged on the ladies room when she saw I was in there and started laughing.\"  Dhemhie, 8/23/18: \"Manager kicked a cup of ice in our faces.\"  Amy, 8/5/18: \"...Literally made it so awkward because the waitress...looked rude.\"  Zoey, 11/25/18: \"At no time did our waitress check to see if we needed anything. All due respect, I don't know what you pay her for.\"  Idalas, 1/22/19: \"Spending over $100 for a meal to feel uncomfortable & unwelcomed.\"  DanYale, 4/9/19: \"The manager should definitely work on her customer service skills because she was as rude as the server.\"  Mstee, 5/16/19: \"Kim the Mgr is rude as hell. My coworkers used to go to Urban but not anymore because of Kim.\"  David, 5/24/19: \"Not a great experience. Customer service wise, our waitress was not friendly at all...and it kind of ruined the experience for us.\"  Fumi, 7/14/19:  \"They need to do something with this waitress. Too abrasive for customer service.\"  Diamond, 8/9/19: \"Horrible service. I have never been treated this way at any other restaurant.  Really regret my choice to come...The waitress has ruined my whole mood.\"  Xinhao, 8/10/19: \"The waitress is so rude. She alone makes this restaurant the worst I have ever been in my life.\"  Mojio, 7/8/19: \"Service is the worst I've ever seen..The waitress was yelling and everyone that heard her was appalled and disgusted.\"  Roueida H., 8/16/19 [Istanbul, Turkey]: \"We would have liked to have a waitress with a smile...instead of having someone who just was there to do her job.\"  One Yelper asked the notorious server to tell her the price of something, and the server rudely gestured to the wall where prices were listed. (But the Yelper had broken her glasses and couldn't see it.) Two Yelpers said they were abused by rude comments about their race & ethnicity.  There are more examples.  I'll leave it here. People celebrating milestones and family gatherings to have their dinner ruined by the surly waitress and the dysfunctional manager.  (The rest of you leaving 4/5 star reviews are too happy-go-lucky!!)  So, you tell me, for the past 3 1/2 years of a reign of terror by a deranged waitress (and an enabling and equally disordered \"manager\") and no lasting change has been implemented? Do you think this place cares about its customers? The 4.5 star average belies a very dark and troubling service issue. If they lack integrity in their service (and ignore significant customer complaints about it), can you fully trust their integrity when it comes to their food? And in fact 62 reviews complained that the shrimp was \"mushy,\" not fresh, \"old,\" had hair in the food, was flavorless, or was too salty. And no Business response to these troubling comments here on Yelp?? That tells me all I need to know.  To be fair, the order of crab, shrimp, lobster, and sausage (one-serving bag was $80) with the signature \"Urban\" sauce that I ordered to share with my husband for our wedding anniversary was tasty and spicy enough.  (Didn't find any hair in it, either! Yay. But shrimp WAS mushy).  But ordering our food on the phone brought out all of the crazy in the hostile waitress. She practically hung up on us! Then when I picked up the food, I was certain she mistook me for the stepmom she blames for her parents' divorce.  No matter how GOOD the food is, a sadistic server leaves a BAD taste!   I only suggest you come here if you're doing your doctoral thesis in \"Cluster B\" personality disorders and want a test case.",

Crab without Garlic Noodles is like Gin without Juice (okay, okay--I just had to slip that in there) but honestly, I was disappointed about that. Our table ordered the Urban Mix with crab and sausage with a mild flavor. I was truly impressed that the crab had great seasoning; not a lot of meat inside, but great seasoning. The price of each person wasn't cheap but it overly priced as well. We ended up getting some fried rice to sop up the seafood and it was delicious!  I encourage you to order the corn as well! Oh goodness; I was taking my dinner DOWNN! The corn was too good to be True! Yummy indeed.  Surprisingly, the time that we arrived, the restaurant was busy. After a short 10 min waits, we had a table. Our server gave us his full attention when it was needed and gave great recommendations. I also had a tasty drink to go with my menu; such a great treat!  Make sure to wear your bib as you do get messy when eating here. Overall, everything was to our liking the service was great!",

The house sake is also BOGO! Cant go wrong with that!  The mexican corn fritters are so good, a little spice and creamy corn inside. The fried fish is also on point! Fried to perfection and comespiping hot to the table. The clams and the shrimp are always fresh. The urban mix flavoring is the best but can be spicy.  They also serve fresh coconut juice in real coconut. Refreshing way to wash down spicy food.  They also have a cool claw machine were you can pick your own lobster! I havent tried that yet, but plan on it! If you want great seafood without the wait, try this place!",

My boyfriend and I decided that getting the Street Combo was the best option, because it offered one choice of crab, two choices of other select seafood, and sides for $65. I wanted 1 lbs of shrimp, he wanted 1 lbs of crawfish, and we both wanted crab and sides, so it was perfect. The urban mix, extra mild sauce was delicious! I was very satisfied after our meal, which could probably serve up to 4 people actually.   Prices when ordering individually vary depending on the market value. When we went, crawfish was around $10.99/lb, Shrimp was $13.99/lb, and king crab was like $22/lb.   They also have a $2 game, where if you catch a lobster, they'll cook it for you! Pretty clever!  Looking forward to going back already.",

I also used the sauce with the fried rice and it was heaven. Urban mix is basically a mix of all 4 of their sauces (garlic butter, Cajun, lemon pepper, Louisiana style). The clams itself seemed fresh.  My friends ordered other seafood here but all agreed the sauce was delicious. For pricing, it's relatively comparable to boiling crab.   They also have some less ordinary things on their menu like frog legs and alligator. And in the back you can get your own lobster with a claw machine. I think it was $2.   The staff was friendly and food came out relatively quick!",

Lol, I told her I had something new for her to try because I know she likes spicy foods too. So I browsed my trusty old bookmarks & found 3 restaurants of this style and this 1 seemed better than the rest. Although, I've always wondered wth are they directly across from Hot n Juicy. But anyway, we came in about 8pm on a Friday night and there weren't many tables filled, but people came in after we did so that made me happy! We were seated at a booth instantly and the table was already set up for us with menus. We ordered drinks 1st & got them quickly. Then we ordered the food. Fried alligator, fried frog legs, 1lb shrimp/1lb crablegs boil, 8pc buffalo wings, & fries. The food came out fairly quickly too. Everything was fresh!   Alligator- 2/5 not good. Never got a good portion of meat, seemed more like scraps of popcorn chicken.   Shrimp-4/5 good.  Crablegs-3/5 good, but didn't seem to have an actual 1lbs. It was only 1 claw of 4 or 5. That's not a lb.  Froglegs-5/5 GREAT, they were so juicy & meaty.   Chicken wings 4/5 they were good.   Service was pleasant too, but they screwed up my bill & over charged me. They corrected the error w/a Smile, but double check your bill for accuracy.",

Urban Crawfish Station is an extremely casual, lackadaisical, free for all! I should have left after the comfortable server shared she was going to seat me in the \"colored section\" (verbatim).\" Poor poor taste!    After waiting a ridiculous amount of time for our Street Combo $64.95 it arrived incorrect. Fifteen minutes later it arrived a second time and went down hill after that.   The massive well overcooked lobster marinated in awkwardly sweet spicy seasonings was chewy and unsatisfactory. We ate what we could and left the remainder in the pan with all of our hopes and expectations. It was evident we were disappointed.    The fried oysters were the size of chicken tenders and not desirable. I will share the batter was delicious; therefore I'm confident their fried items are probably amazing.   Overall $85+ tip wasted. Try at your on risk but this \"colored\" girl will not be back!",

I think they were understaffed too, because it took me a while to be seated and then to get the food. I think only two people were working.

    "text": "EXECUTIVE SUMMARY: The waitress at this Bayou/Cajun/Creole venue was quite friendly and attentive. The bad news is that that is the only positive thing I can say about this place.  I did not heed the most primary of restaurant omens: When I arrived at 6:30pm - dinner hour - I was the only guest. While I was there only two other tables became occupied. If nobody is dining at a venue, don't YOU dine at that venue ... else you'll find out why.  There were other omens I overlooked: beverage in a Styrofoam cup (so they don't have to wash glasses), no salt & pepper shakers (so they don't have to wash or wipe-down salt & pepper shakers), waxed butcher paper draped over the table-top upon my seating (so they don't have to sanitize or wipe-down the table-tops), one-page laminated menus (that can be given a quick wipe-down every once in a while), no dining utensils, plastic or otherwise (so they don't have to ... well, you get the picture).   All this front-of-house effort to minimize sanitation diligence ... doesn't exactly raise confidence as to diligent sanitary effort in the back-of-house ... of a seafood restaurant, no less.  Sure enough, things didn't go well. I ordered a fried seafood basket. Reasonably flavorful, a bit too much of too-salty batter, but not overly greasy. Yet several bites into, my belly started filling up fast. That filling morphed into outright bloating. I boxed up the other half and ski-daddled. Two hours later ... and the half I ate at the restaurant was sitting at the bottom of my stomach like a wet bag of rocks. And lots more bloating, sour belching, shooting pains in the stomach ... you know the drill. I couldn't imagine eating a single bite of anything else for at least 24 hours. Except a couple of Zantac tabs.  I cannot explain why my own negative experience does not marry well to all the four-star and five-star reviews also posted here. I cannot explain ... I can only report. YMMV.  CONCLUSION: I wouldn't stop here again for ice water in August.",

Traveling once a month to LV I'm trying to venture out and trust my yelpers to steer me and they did NOT steer me wrong. I ordered 1lb snow crab, urban mix mild because I can't handle the heat .  After a furious feasting, I can report it's great!  Of course I just tried the snow crab so I'll have to sacrifice myself and come back and try other things. Btw, the service was top notch, Kim is great, her suggestions and service made this a great experience",

I am not disappointed at all, their sauce is a bit difference then BC.  It is not as thick, but still very tasty ( I like it anyway).  Price is very reasonable, shrimp and all ingredients are very fresh.  Unlike BC, their shrimp sometimes is  not fresh at all, basically, you go there for their sauce only.  Therefore, if I come to LV again I def will come back here.  Please keep up with the good work.  Thanks for an amazing dinner for our family :)  * ps: try their House Special Fried Rice",

I sit at the bar she slaps down a menu and walks away. 5 min later she returns and ask me have I decided. I got s catfish basket. She didn't ask if I wanted a drink or even offered water while I waited. She disappeared to the back. About 10 min later she asked if I wanted tartar sauce or cocktail. Then she got upset because I didn't know right away. If I hadn't paid for my food already I would hAve walked out. If this is the service that they have it's unfortunate because the food was good.

    "text": "Great dinner passing through Vegas! It is away from the strip and the tourist spots, tucked away in a corner of Chinatown. It wasn't too busy on a Monday evening and we were seated right away. We decided to go a la carte because we wanted to customize our order more and it wound up being around the same price as the combos anyway. My family of four got a dungeness crab in the smokin' sauce, king crab legs in the garlic butter, and two pounds of shrimp in the lemon pepper sauce. The lemon pepper sauce was the best! Dungeness crab had so much flavor and everything was so fun to dig into. The corn on the cob was unreal!    Three complaints:  -We got an appetizer of fried calamari, which was a total waste of money. It had zero flavor, meat, and did not even come with a sauce.  -The garlic butter sauce was WAY too salty.  -There were ZERO vegetables on the menu.   Be aware that the prices for the crabs on the menu are per pound, not per crab. Our bill came out to ~$100, which is not bad at all for the amount of great seafood we ate! Although the meal wasn't perfect, I still give this place 5 stars for the memorable flavors and unique and fun eating experience.",

    "text": "My wife & I are big fan of both Boiling Crab & Hot n Juicy.  Last night, after 10 pm, Hot n Juicy was closed & we accidentally found this place called Urban Crawfish. Never been here before. It was around 10:25 pm and only one table was occupied. Late hours and it was understandable. Bit sketical but we decided to give it a try and ordered carry out. 1 lb Crawfish in spicy, 1 lb shrimp medium spicy & 1 lb shrimp extra mild sauce. What kind of sauces they were are not important in this review because everyone has different taste. Just because I didn't like their sauce doesn't mean it is a bad restaurant.  Different restaurant...different recipe. ...simple.     We got home & finally get settled to enjoy our late dinner on our day off. Well, very disappointing taste of sauce, but like I said, it's only personal preference.  I'm sure there are lot of people who love this recipe.  But Crawfish not being fresh? That's a totally different issue.    If you are Crawfish lover, like I am, you understand the joy of sucking the brain juice out of Crawfish. To me .... that's the best part. But at the same time It's also one of the nastiest tasting thing if it is not fresh. I tried 6 crawfish and ended up throwing them away. Just terrible. I've never been a review writer on Yelp. But paying $ & tasting  not fresh shelfish? Its just very difficult to tolerate.  Expecially when I'm a chef myself.    As I write this review with bad taste in my mouth, my wife is making a sanswich. I'll let you take a guess why.",

My girlfriend Elly and I noticed Urban Crawfish Station and two guys were working (Raju and Kevin). They were super helpful. They were hosting, serving, food running, and bussing. Aside from the great service, the food was also amazing, with great quality and flavorful sauces. Definitely coming here more often with my girlfriend and recommend this place to anybody who enjoys seafood.",

    "text": "Great service, our waitress came to check on us multiple times but then again there were only 2 other parties in the restaurant late Sunday night.   Lovely decor, clean restrooms and they give you gloves to use to peel your shrimp and crawfish. I wasn't a fan of the gloves though because I felt they got in my way. It would be nice if they gave out more than one small ketchup container per 3 people so we wouldn't have to flag them down for more.   I went with two other friends and everyone ordered a Lb of shrimp mild with all the sauces combined (forgot the name). Mild has a nice kick to it. One friend ordered the medium spicy and regretted it halfway through saying that he couldn't feel his mouth. The sauce here is watery, it doesn't have a thick consistency like other places I've been to and after a while it does get a bit salty (imo). The salt& pepper with like juice mixture helps with that. The shrimp seemed fresh enough, tons of garlic in the sauce but yet it was missing something... I can't quite put my finger on it.   We also got Cajun fries and they were the fatter ones, sort of like steak fries and we're still super hot after sitting out for a while! You could definitely tell that they were freshly made.   Overall, I left feeling so so since the sauce was decent and I like my fries on the skinnier/crispier side. Not sure what boiling crab prices for shrimp is, in CA I think it's $10.99,  here it's $11.99 which isn't too bad of a price difference.",

I get back to hotel and didn't have the sauce I ordered on side (was looking forward to biting into my po'boy, soaked in garlic butter sauce, oh the disappointment), called the restaurant and they were willing to take the sauce to my hotel (25 minutes away)..... Even though that would've been perfect, I couldn't have my po'boy (which was cold at this point) with such sauce (25 minutes later). Oh the heartache...... But other than that it was great. The food is so yummy and I can't wait to go back (couple years probably)...... But we shall return. YUMMMMM",

It wasn't busy at all. PERFECT.  We order a catfish and shrimp po boy. One lb of snow crab legs. Sausage and potatoes. In their house sauce spicy. Mmm Mmm Mmm. It was delicious. I could have eaten so much more.  The server was nice and attentive.  We will return for sure. It's a new place.  If you are wanting to avoid how packed hot and juicy gets.

At first taste it it seemed very lightly seasoned and not as flavorful as most places... However as we are on it was super yummy! The light and more \"watery\" sauce was perfect and not too over bearing.  We didn't leave feeling like we just bit into an entire garlic.. Lol.  We left feeling happy and full!  We'll definitely be back (once they start serving beer. Lol)  the service was awesome too and it's decently priced. And the place is super clean!! Plus there's a lobster game that I wanna try not next time. Lol. Food n games, what's not to love?!",

If you want combination platers, they have four to pick from. You pick your spice flavoring, set the level of spice, and then your 'combination'.   We're big eaters and was going for the biggest combo but reconsidered and we left hungry, to embarrassed to order more, (next time we know!)  They have bottle beer, domestic and foreign. They have tea and soda, but it's ashame they don't have draft with iced cold mugs, that would be 'the bomb' oh and some french bagets to take in some of the juices we left in the bottom of the bag!  Our server was busy talking to the other table but the rest of the staff was attentive and helped out, we'll go back to try the poor boys and the fried platter!",

Obviously the service was really slow, most tables haven't been cleaned up yet, but some tables were available.    They could have sat us down first but no one care enough to do it.  After standing there for 15 mins, we decided to take off.  We kinda lost the trust to dine there coz who know how much longer we gonna wait for food & drinks.

It is located in a strip mall with lots of parking available. This area of Vegas is a bit \"sketchy\", but we had no issues at lunchtime on a weekday.  Our server was exceptionally good (a young man from Alaska): friendly, helpful, respectful, and interesting. Great guy! He helped with suggestions on the menu and had good advice.  The food was outstanding. The only thing comparable was previous trips to New Orleans where I've had the best Cajun food ever - but this place was very good and unexpectedly comparable to top Cajun food from NO.  The bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was wonderful, and our main course lobster with shrimp and crawfish were top notch. We got the smokin' style sauce which I recommend, and the $59.95 Smokin' Deal with choice of crab legs, dungeness, or lobster, along with a pound of 2 of the following: crawfish, clam, mussel, shrimp, blue crab. Not all choices may be available since they arrive fresh. We had the medium spice which was nice. I would have liked  more spice but my daughter does not like super spicy so medium with the smokin' flavor was a great compromise and tasted great.  This $59.95 deal along with the bacon wrapped shrimp appetizer was perfect for 2 people. We arrived hungry and were ready to eat!  We will definitely come back on our next trip to Vegas! Thanks for reading!",

Chose king crab, clams, crawfish...started with Kumamoto on half shell. First, pass on the oysters-you can do better. I like hot stuff and this was perfect at the regular spicy. Was dipping the corn back in to soak up more spiced butter. The frog legs were okay, juicy and fried lightly-I dipped those in the butter too, although my clown-faces friend (she looked like Steve buscemi applying lipstick) said it was already spicy. The kind-hearted waiter brought ice cream without request and it was welcome. No booze here. No real dessert. You do leave full. Pass on oysters. Crawfish were tasty, clams were good.

There are other mix bags options and different prices of course. Other similar places you order the seafood individually and yeah you can share but it's not the same.  They come out with 1 big bag and rip it open on a platter to share amongst the table, I'm telling when I come to Vegas I like to bring our group of friends here.

    "text": "My friend and I stopped in here because we are both seafood junkies and this place came highly recommended to us! We came around 6:30-6:45PM and it wasn't very busy we we pretty much had the pick of the place to seat. We loved that the booths were roomy and not crowded. We decided on the fried alligator, which was really good but the dipping sauce seemed a little weird to me. For dinner we decided to do one of their \"Smokin' Deals' which is a seafood boil. We decided on the second one because there was only two of us which was where you get to pick one crab or lobster option then two options from mussels, crawfish, clams, shrimp and blue crab. It includes potatoes, corn and sausage. We went with snow crab, clams and shrimp.   Now the seasoning was the tricky part. My friend can't eat anything real spicy, so our waitress recommended the very mild option which we took. I took a side of the next spicier option on the side for myself for dipping. Boy, was it all still too spicy for her! Next time we'll get no spice at all. I on the other hand, enjoyed both but even the very mild still had that kick to it that was a tad much. Even an order of french bread (which was not exactly buttered in any kind of uniform, just a bit here and there) didn't help her with the spice.    That being, it was still very tasty and we still had to take some to go because we were so full! I thought that they were a little more expensive than other seafood boils I've had and you really don't get that much crab at all. Overall, it was a pretty okay experience, just if you are at all sensitive to heat I'd recommend no spice at all, and stick to regular menu items. I think you'd get more bang for your buck.",

The service from out hostess was good, no issues there. Ordered my kid the wing basket urban mix mild. When she got them she didn't enjoy the sauce on the wings so we requested to switch them out to lemon pepper wings. They returned the wings with the same have eaten wing and failed to even communicate that. Once noticed, we brought it to the hostess' attention, she stated that the cook/manager simply added more lemon flavor to the previous sauce. Talk about bad customer service! We requested regular lemon pepper wings and once the hostess returned to stated that the manager told her that he would replace them but subtract the wing that was half eaten by my daughter. Smh. All in all, we still ended up having to pay for the wing basket but our nice hostess comped our drinks smh. We def won't be going back. This shows the lack of customer service these days. Decent fried rice but def not worth eating again.",

The resturant has a nice young friendly feel to it and was super clean. I ordered a shrimp po boy sandwich and it came hot & quick. It was a huge and filling. Bun was perfectly toasted and the shrimp were fried perfectly. I also ordered the cajun fries and the portion was most definitely more than I could finish. They were a tad bit over seasoned to my liking but we're still delish. I will be back with friends to visit again. Also big thanks to my waiter Phil for being knowledgeable, friendly and attentive!",

The reason I'm giving 4 stars is because of an incredibly rude waitress who served us. She was very brash, seemed like she didn't want to be there and handled things like she was constantly mad. I can't give a name since she was the least bit talkative. She made the experience a little bitter for me and almost put me in a bad mood but I decided to forget her and enjoy my time and food with family. Another waitress who stopped by our table was incredibly sweet. So I don't think this is a common thing but gee, I wish the second waitress had been the one serving us instead. Dunno if this rude woman was the manager but hopefully not. She kinda tainted the atmosphere, especially since it's such a small place and not many people come in at a time. Other guests appeared annoyed with her as well.",

Smokin Crawfish definitely met if not surpassed expectations. Server was very attentive. Staff went above and beyond to give what customer wanted. They went out of there way to provide me with items that were currently out of stock. Garlic butter and smokin sauce is very flavorful. Soft shell crab was cooked with perfect crunch and crisp. Shrimps were more than expected for 1 lb. Blue crab yes they have blue crab was fresh and tasty.     Other similar style restaurants need to look out. We have a new rookie in town. In my opinion, it wont be too long before this place gets the recognition it deserves. I cant wait to come back and try other things on the menu. Alligator sounds interesting.

We were very disappointed once the food started arriving. The seasoning didn't taste as good as their competitors, the seafood pasta was bland and the deep fried catfish was mostly breading. They mixed up the seasonings for our shrimp and snow crab legs - normally this isn't a big deal, but it's an issue if a customer specifically orders something with no extra spice! All our waitress could say was \"sorry\" and that her \"boss would bite her head off\" if the boss heard about this mess up. She offered other sauces to try and tame it down, but this was absolutely unacceptable. Another woman, who may have been a manager, came by to check on things and when she heard what had happened she immediately offered a new bag of snow crab legs prepared as we initially ordered.  As we were finishing our meal we had to pack our pasta to go. When requesting a to go box, the waitress found an opportunity to joke about spitting in our food!!   Bottom line, never going back there again nor would I recommend this place to anyone.",

The seasoning isn't as heavy as some of the other shops, the price is on par, and the service is decent. If you haven't tried a crab boil before this is a good place to start.

They have a lobster claw machine in the back for $2 each game that I have yet to try. Catch it, and they'll cook it for you. Service is great, and you can easily have a conversation with the people working here.  How is this place compared to Boiling Crab? I would say it's a matter of personal preference. BC's sauce is more buttery in my opinion which gives it a more flavorful punch. Both times that I've been here, my parties preferred BC. However, I thought this place was good too. I definitely do feel a lot better after eating here though as I do not feel as bloated from BC's sauce (butter is obviously not a good thing but makes food tastes sooooo gooooood). Shrimp size is smaller than what I'm used to, but a pound of shrimp along with some cajun fries still fills me up. Just a little extra peeling work.  So yeah..one word...PREFERENCE.",

The seafood may not be so fresh, but they are of good taste with the source, specially the snow crab legs! Also, if you are Chinese, the steamed rice would satisfy you :)  The server might recommend the combo, but you might not need that, just pick your own choice. I did the calculation and I don't think it would be any cheaper if I order the combo.    We've missed the seafood and the Chinese food quite a lot. We choose here after compared it to Hoy N Juicy 'cause it seems to serve more food choice and most importantly it satisfies our typical Chinese stomach :) It's really a good experience here in Las Vegas!

    "text": "\"Clean\" is really the best singular word to describe what's going on with the flavor and spice here when it comes to their take on the signature seafood-in-a-bag thing a la Hot-N-Juicy Crawfish style swamp dinner. (\"Swamp dinner\" you say? I am coining that as my own right now as I just made that up.)  Is \"clean\" what you want when it comes to this very unique cuisine? Probably not. I ordered my requisite 1lb clams and 1lb head-on shrimp with built-in corn cobs and potatoes and totally missed the oodles of garlic I assumed would be a part of the sauce. There was barely *any* sauce, and there were barely any garlic chunks to be found in the sauce. And the Smokin' Crawfish sauce was light, almost watery, and decidedly *not* buttery and not as savory as the HNJ sauce. A disappointment, both obviously and subconsciously, as I found myself instinctively wanting more umami, more swampy mystery substance. It just isn't here. You can pretend and conjure all you want, but there really is no x-factor in the sauce here. More disappointment: the proteins here are at least one-level *smaller* compared to those at the competing seafood-in-a-bag joints. The clams are 25% smaller, and the shrimp are 21/25 count, not the 16/20 (or sometimes even 11/15) count you find at the other places.   Don't get me wrong, if you've *never* had the Hot-N-Juicy \"Special\" or Boiling Crab \"Whole Shebang\" sauce experience, you'd probably think, \"Wow, this shit is good!\" and order more. But I cut my losses and decided to order another $2 Miller Lite (happy hour special) and call it a check. I need garlic chunks in my swamp dinner sauce. It's a dealbreaker! Yeah, the sauce at HNJ is so murky and mystical it can even give you hives if you consume too much of a funky batch, but it's worth the risk - it's SO good!  Bonus points: on the \"clean\" tip, all of the shrimp I received at Smokin' Crawfish were poop-less. Not deveined, but poop-less. Not sure if this is on purpose, but I thought it was worth noting, if you care about this sorta thing.  Nevertheless fun to support a \"new\" local spot trying to grab some of the swamp dinner market share - and it's a very big market! I totally understand why Smokin' Crawfish decided to open up shop.",

Next time we'll try the spicy.",

By the time we all got our food, the first person to get hers was pretty much done (we forced her to start eating cause her food was getting cold). We asked why the food was coming out slow cause it wasn't like it was crazy busy, but our server said they had a new cook and apparently he was messing up the orders or something...way to throw someone under the bus. Also, my friend's Sierra Mist came out AFTER we ate. And we put in two orders of steamed rice right at the beginning, but we got one order of rice waaay before our food got to us, and the other order of rice in the middle of the meal. So...  Would've been 5 stars cause the food was really good, but the slow and not-so-good service kind of ruined our night, so 2 stars short. Sucks cause I reaaally wanted to give this place 5 stars cause the ambience and food was on point, but the service...eh.   Then again, must have been a bad night. I'll give this place another go in about a month when they get their service together.",

Staff was friendly and everyone seemed to enjoy their food. They have plenty of TVs and even have an arcade claw game where for $2 you play to catch a live lobster that they'll cook for you if you're lucky enough to catch one.

The sauces they have are DELICIOUS, the \"smokin style\" is of course a star, but try the \"garlic butter\" too. It might sound a big basic (I mean, come on, garlic & butter?), but there's actually other stuff in there too that makes it damn tasty. Shrimp always tends to be my favorite at crawfish places (it's got the most meat!), but the clams and mussels were also good. As for the heat factor -- I tend to think of myself as being able handle the heat, but \"medium\" was a bit much for me, we stuck to \"mild\" for the second time we were here.   Another secret is their deep fried oysters... that shit is ADDICTING, we must have had 8 baskets of it total by the end of the week. They deepfry them perfectly, with crispy outside bits & a juicy, tender oyster on the inside. Ugh, I wish this place was closer to home...",

The price and the quality of the experience was more than fair. My husband and I got a whole dungeness crab, shrimp, and mussels with extra mild spice with the combination sauce that came with corn, potatoes, and sausages, jumbo frog legs that came with fries, and a half dozen of kumomoto oysters. Everything was delicious and flavorful. This was the first time coming to a Cajen seafood establishment where I left being so full that I could barely walk. Usually at boiling crab or hot n juicy I still have room for dessert somewhere in Chinatown but last night I couldn't even think about it, haha. There weren't that many servers like at other places like this, but everyone still put the effort to make sure that the table was checked on and drink refills were checked on very promptly. Another thing that I thought was cool was the crane game where you can catch your own lobster for them to cook. I will definitely be back and come with friends!",

It also came with red potatoes, corn on the cob, and delicious little chunks of  bratwurst. Great fun to eat and delicious.

They handled my request for a side of steamed broccoli, which allowed me to stay on my special diet. Myself and my dining partner have both eaten crawfish in Louisiana and would rank this up there with crawfish boils we experienced here. Excellent value and wonderful experience.",

We were kind of thrown off because we were the only customers and was afraid that the food would not be great. But to our surprise, everything was great!!!! We ordered the blue point oysters which was fresh as can be. We ordered two \"Street\" combos with the urban mix and medium spice level. 2 orders was enough for 4 people. The medium spice level was perfect for me but one of our friends couldn't handle it. The amazing and super friendly owner (great customer service) gave her some milk and ice cream to alleviate the burn. Overall, we had a great experience--great food, quality seafood, and friendly atmosphere. I would definitely come back!!",

I had gone to Smokin' Crawfish restaurant with a few of my good friends.  The atmosphere is young,modern and hip compared to the neighboring Crawfish places.  We were greeted and escorted to a table let right away. Our server was also the co-owner.   We ordered beer, Modelo, Shock top, and Newcastle. Then we ordered apps. Our server suggested the premium oyster, which was so fresh. We loved it and my friend ordered the Buffalo wings after to share before our order came. We all ordered pound shrimp woth garlic butter and rice. I was different. I ordered the smokin' style which was amazing!    I definitely will recommend to all my friends and family!",

Their seafood is huge and their urban mix is delicious! I had snow crab legs, mussels, sausage and corn all mixed in their urban mix and it was literally finger licking good! I love garlic and they have pieces in the sauce. My hubby had calamari and the fried catfish basket which was also delicious. We dipped everything in their urban mix sauce with no regrets! Their service is great as well, Billy was awesome! Very knowledgeable and friendly. Every waiter working checked on us as well to make sure we were ok. That's awesome service right there! I enjoyed every minute of our experience. They also have awesome happy hour specials. We got two free beers with our order. We love this place and will definitely be back!

Lunch was a pound of King Crab Legs (which was two large legs) in their Cajun Spice and Medium as far as the spice level goes..... This was delicious! Market Price on this particular day was $28. The Fried Shrimp Basket with Fries is something I would pass on the next time.

We got the shrimp, blue crab, mussels combo with combo flavors mild heat for slight kick. Sauce tasted bomb and seafood fresh. We also tried fried corn bites and house special shrimp fried rice. Also tasty. The only item that could be better was the cajun calamari which was overcooked and chewy. Overall still great experience.

Staff that need recognition. Alex, Mar Keith, and Romeo.  You won't be disappointed!",

Flavors weren't there and they tasted at the same level of spice, which wasn't even mild at all, had no ounce of kick.. bread was good and so were the fries.. Sticking with boiling crab.",

Unlike other Cajun restaurants who only carry blue point oysters. They also serve different varieties of alcohol such as cocktails & sakes. The staff is always friendly! Kim is a really great server! She made my experience wonderful at urban crawfish! I'm a returning customer and I highly recommend this place!",

We also both ordered a pound of snow crabs with corn and sausage, same sauce as shrimp and again, not disappointed. The next time I come to Vegas I'm going there first!",

I had it for lunch the next day, there are plenty of crawfish tails in there and it's very filling. I want to go back and try the frog legs and alligator.",

I tried the mild urban mix in the boulevard combo, my seafood choices being lobster, blue crab, shrimp, mussels, king crab, and crawfish. The urban mix is super flavorful and the seafood was fresh. I also got raw oysters which tasted great, and the shrimp fried rice I ordered was surprisingly delicious. It didn't taste like your average Chinese takeout fried rice, which is a good thing. Next time, I could do without the onion rings, they weren't as crunchy as I thought they would be. The staff, although a bit understaffed for a Friday night was very helpful and my waiter was very thorough in his explanation of the menu as it was my first time there. There is even a claw game to catch lobsters to eat, which I thought was pretty funny. Overall, a great place to have fresh, flavorful seafood and next time I'm in Las Vegas I'll be sure to stop by again!",

The place wasn't too busy at the time so we figured we'd get our food pretty quick.  I ended up getting 1 lb of shrimp with the urban mix along with some sweet potato fries while my friends got crawfish, rice, and shrimp. It took like 20-30 minutes to get our food, but we didn't mind too much since we were just talking and watching people play the lobster claw machine. Food finally came, but we didn't have any napkins, bibs, or gloves. It took a while for the waiter to come to our table which was pretty bad since the place wasn't even busy. He didn't do a good job at checking up on us and didn't even give us the bib or gloves until we requested it and we had already started eating. Like seriously? That's some pretty bad service. To make things worse the food didn't even make up for the subpar service due to the lack of flavor and the fries weren't even crispy.  I'm not really sure why this place has such a high rating. Maybe they were just having a bad night, but I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon. I don't really like giving out 2 stars, but I feel like that was the type of experience I had. I'll probably just go to Boiling Crab or Hot N Juicy Crawfish.",

I also like that fact that they give you a tin plate for all ur juices and food. I don't have to dig in the bag for the juices. Yum!",

It's a bit pricy for lunch and a homeless person started yelling at me in the parking lot, that the only reason I knocked down a star.

I ordered half a dozen of oysters, 1 lb of shrimp (they dont do half lb orders), corn and rice! My oysters were huge and fresh, although I had 1 squeamish moment because there was a baby crab that looked like a spider on top of 1 of my oysters. Another server told me it was a baby crab and just brushed it on top:( anyway, it wouldnt stop me from eating my shrimps. I had to ask for lemons and salt and pepper. My shrimps were cooked perfectly! Their sauce was good too.   I liked my experience here, but I'll definitely be sticking with Hot N Juicy:)",

Smokin Crawfish has a similar style and taste like the popular \"hot n juicy\" or \"boiling crab\"   We ordered the \"smokin deal\" combo ($59.95) which included 3 of your choice (we picked snow crab, shrimp, and crawfish. About 1 lbs each) seafood with potato, corn, and sausage. I must say it filled the two us up quite nice! Amazing flavors, extra garlic-y, and a nice medium spice. The seafood tasted fresh. Pick your seafood, your flavor, then your spice level. Soooo onolicious!  I also tried their SOFT SHELL CRAB PO BOY, and oh boy was it delicious! Bread was soft and chewy, and crab was fried to perfection!  I will be back for sure.  Last but not least our server was so friendly and knowledgable I think her name was Nicole? (Young lady,  soft brown hair) she checked up on us often and always had a smile on her face. Also Kim was great too! Great new spot, I think this place will be one of my \"regulars\" .",

    "text": "Fairly new and deserving of the high ratings it's received so far.  Smokin' Crawfish is not unlike your other seafood-boil-in-a-bag places such as Hot n Juicy or The Boiling Crab.  In fact, some of the flavors are just as good or possibly better than their rivals and at reasonable prices (about a $1 less than the latter two for a lb. of shrimp).  When we arrived one night, we were the only customers there.  It's kind of weird and unexpected but at other crawfish places you might have to wait to be seated.  The positive to this is no waiting and food in front of you as quickly as you can order!  The downside is the missing amazing aroma in the air as you walk into a busy crawfish spot.  I swear, with just one whiff of that garlicky, lemon peppery, amazing fragrance in the air and you'll have me salivating more puddles than Pavlov's dog.  That sets the tone for the rest of the night and something I like when I go to a crawfish spot.  Won't be the case here when you're the only diners at the time.  The two pounds of shrimp we ordered were nice-sized shrimp and there were plenty of shrimp in the bag.  As a tip for new customers who have never ate at these types of joints, ask for plastic gloves if you don't want to get your hands dirty because you'll be peeling the shrimp and your hands will smell like the Smokin' Crawfish sauce the next day.  I also enjoyed their own take on fried rice made with shrimp and crawfish!  It was yummy.  The service was fine but hard to rate because we were the only ones there.  As this place gets popular, we'll have to see if their staff could keep up.  I believe there was only one or maybe a second server there at that time.  To end on a cool note, they have the Lobster claw machine game here.  If you manage to catch a lobster, they will cook it for you for free!   Maybe this one instance I'll forget what my parents preached to me a long time ago while I play with my food for just a little bit.",

The king crab was so darn good! Their flavors were similar to Boiling Crab but when you try them, you'll know the difference. I love that they have seafood packages and there's so much to choose from! Will definitely be back and will be recommending this place to our friends and family.

Unfortunately, I don't know what people who come here and claim it to be better than, or as good as Hot n Juicy are thinking. They must be smoking something as much as this restaurants namesake is smokin'. The \"oil\" they refer to at HNJ is butter. They are right; the oil is not here but the juice is also just watered down and pretty bland. I rather they use butter and make a tasty boil of some sort. Mainly, I come for the shrimp. I've ordered 3 types now. Honestly, I can make better shrimp at home, and I hardly call myself a cook, besides the literal form (as in no longer raw when I am done with it). The garlic is too big to flavor the shrimp. Maybe if they cut it into tiny pieces, the flavor would come out. Add some spices, salt, etc.  I just don't feel the shrimp has any taste. The flavor is just not there. Some people want to drink the juice from HNJ like a soup but this is more like the water left over from rinsing the HNJ pot. If you went to Cravin Cajun or whatever District 1 was called before switching to their bland oxtail pho and not making crawfish and shrimp, this place has shrimp that's below their shrimp. Yeah that bad. At least Raging had bigger shrimps to offset the lack of taste compared to HNJ. Smokin lacks both size and taste. That's not good. I tried the fried oysters and it was good. Nothing to write my mom about, and if you did. Uh, say hi to your mom. The extra mild here is indeed extra mild and the mild is indeed mild, versus HNJ where the extra mild is more like mild and still has a little kick to it. So, in that department they hit the nail on the head.  The place is clean and bright. Service is awesome. I just feel bad for them because I cannot see them around in a year or two. Maybe they will go from making shrimp and crawfish to making an oxtail pho too, decorate themselves with a bow or two and call themselves District 2, Mocking Shrimp.  So overall great people but very average taste. I'll stick to the first and only shrimp place for me, across the street ( and down the street).",

We got our sweet potato fries but the rest or our appetizer orders never came. Finally, our main courses came along with our waters. Our waters were never refilled and the rest of our appetizers never showed up...even though we asked for them 3 different times! It was very upsetting :/ We even had to ask for the shell fish crackers because they weren't even offered to us and without them we couldn't even crack into our crab legs.Finally, we asked them to cancel our appetizers and just asked for our check. Food is great but the service is bad enough that no matter how good it is...we would not go back any time soon.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this restaurant. Especially with all the great reviews, my boyfriend and I were excited to get away from all the food on the Strip. We're from California, so restaurants like this one really have a lot to prove if they want to stick around. We came here on a Sunday night around 7pm. It was pretty empty and we were one of three tables in the restaurant. I don't know what everyone is talking about when they rave about the service - our waitress seemed pretty uninterested and like she was always in a rush, even though it wasn't busy.   There was also another waitress that was probably training - as she was taking the next table's order, they were asking her what ingredients were in the items and she didn't know, so she called out to another employee at the bar. TIP: have your servers know what ingredients are used in each menu item before you throw them out on the floor...   On to the food. This is where it all pretty much went downhill. We ordered the 2nd combo and got 1 lb. of shrimp, 1lb. of clams, 1 lb. of crawfish and 1 lb. king crab legs, all with a side of cajun fries. The cajun fries came out and they came out plain. No big deal - it was an easy fix. Then our boil bag came out - shrimp, clams, crawfish - all Smokin' Style mild. We were missing our king crab legs, which we assumed came out separately like it does at other places. We found out that the food delivered to our table was our neighbor's food... but we only figured that out after we discussed it with them. The server didn't even come over to apologize to either table - they just dropped off our king crab legs about 10 minutes later. The sauce with the crab legs was much better and was way thicker than the one with the 3 lbs of seafood.   Long story short, I really don't know how this place has a 5-star review... I'm not really a picky person either, but if you make a mistake, own up to it. And try to train your servers to be a little more on the warm and welcoming side. Next time I'm in Vegas, I would probably skip over this place and go back to one of their competitors down the street.",

We ordered one of their combos with lobster and blue crab and shrimp, such a good deal. Other places everything is an add-on and it can get pretty pricey. Their spices and flavor is so much better then Hot & Juicy (I used to be their fan until I discovered this place across the street).  The spacing is bigger and nowhere as near crowed. I think it's because this place is a hidden gem directly across from their competition. I'm hoping to visit again soon and hopefully their food is still as great under their new name!",

The appetizer menu also has a good selection of things, I think more than other seafood restaurants that are similar. I ordered shrimp, cajun fries, and rice (very generous portion).

I valued this place over hot n juicy because of the customer service alone! I loved how great they would treat us every time we visited urban crawfish station. When we came to pick up our food you could tell they were ready to go home. We arrived before closing so we didn't hold them up. We made the mistake of not checking the bags before we left because I was in such a rush to get it back home. There were no utensils, gloves, or even napkins!!! It's a messy meal! That should've been a given to provide! I shouldn't have to ask for that. The food itself was gross! The shrimp were beyond mushy they weren't edible! The flavoring in one bag looked like the bottom of the barrel from the end of the day it was all so gross! On top of that it made our stomachs so upset for two days after we ate it! I'm so displeased with the service and food we got I will not be returning! Granted it was right before close but the amount of money people spend there it should be the same service and quality food no matter what time it's ordered! So disappointed!",

Our server Kevin was very attentive and this lady who seemed like she was the owner really paid attention to all the tables in the restaurant. I'm from socal so we definitely have our share of amazing crawfish places. This review is based solely on crawfish corn and sausages because those 3 are my must haves at every creole/Cajun place. Crawfish isn't in season right now but that didn't stop me from going. I got 2lbs of frozen crawfish for 8.99/lb and it came with corn and a potato and I added in sausages. Probably won't get the sausages again but I loved the corn. It wasn't soggy which can happen at a lot of other places. Crawfish was a decent size, couldn't complain since they're not in season. Forgot what it's called but I got all the sauces with medium spice was sweeter than other places but it wasn't oily which I liked! Their Cajun fries however was thicker than most places and not that crunchy. I may be biased but every boiling crab, kickin crab, claws I went to in OC had suuuuper crunchy fries. I will be back though to try other things like fried alligator. Overall, even though they forgot my sausages and ran our fries to another table, they owned up to it, apologized repeatedly, kept offering my boyfriend sake and then gave me more beer. That's good customer service. They really tried and I appreciate that.",

I had the 1 lb shrimp, 1 lb crawfish, and lobster. I wasn't too impressed with their \"popular sauce\" as what the waiter called it. The sauce was watered down and too spicy. So that was really the deal breaker for me.  2. The service wasn't too bad. Waiter was friendly but not very attentive. 3. Overall, I paid $87 for my food as well as my son's meal. If I was going to spend that much again, I would rather spend it at my favorite seafood place where I know I will not be disappointed.",

This message is 100% Cajun endorsed lol Not only is the food amazing but the service is OUTSTANDING! Mika continues to give exceptional service beyond expectations time and time again. Even when she's busy no drink goes unfilled, your food will always be prompt and exactly the way you order it! Also, Her recommendations are the truth y'all! Listen to her!So glad I stepped out of my comfort zone and tried the \"smokin\" style..which is now called urban style I believe...This place hits it out of the park with the combination of the incredible staff & amazing, tasty, LOUISIANA crawfish..",

If you like your crawlies spicy, they can up the heat by adding ghost peppers to your sauce. So glad they offered this to me. The staff were very nice and accommodating, always a big plus. Whenever I'm back in town, I'll definitely be hitting up Urban Crawfish :)",

I wanted something with a different taste so I searched Yelp for crab and saw Urban Crawfish. Inread the reviews on Yelp and decided to go here to eat. My family and I walked in at about 1pm on a Friday and it was empty. We were greeted by Mika who was very friendly. She sat us at the table and helped us every step of the way to help us order the perfect amount of food for all 6 of us. We ordered the largest combo (there is an name but I cannot remember what it is). We ordered the mildest urban mix seasoning for our King Crab, Shrimp  Clams, Mussels, Corn, Potatoes, Sausage and Blue Crab. IT WAS VERY DELICIOUS! It was a bit spicy for my kids even if it was very mild, but my kids didn't mind because they kept eating. After they finished eating, they had a Shave Ice desert, and that helped to not leave their mouths with a spicy hot feeling. A AWESOME food experience for all of us.and we will definitely go back when we visit Las Vegas again. Thanks Mika! Thanks Urban Crawfish!",

We came here because Boiling Crab was too busy and wanted to try a new place. Ordered 1lb. of crawfish with Cajun sauce and mild spice. The food tasted okay but I guess I prefer the sauce from Boiling Crab. It didn't help that it took 45 min for us to be seated, another 15-20 before we could actually order, and maybe 30 min before our food came out. My boyfriend was getting light headed because he was so hungry haha. The servers looked like they definitely did not enjoy their jobs and it seemed like there weren't enough staff working or something because they were all stressed out and had so many people waiting for their orders to be taken. Probably won't be coming back here for boiled seafood. Maybe to try a po'boy but that's a maybe.",
