    "text": "Executive Summary: One of the best Japanese restaurants in the world!  Value (Price/Quality): Good - price is expensive, but quality is outstanding.   Customer Service: Good, but needs improvement. I've been to other Nobu locations in the world and the service at this location is very sub-standard compared to their Monaco and Hong Kong locations. Especially since this is Las Vegas and America, these waiters, bus boys, and hostess need to earn it. Service at their global locations far more superior.   You'll like this place if: If you appreciate Tasting Menus, been to Japan, like baller places or have a global taste palate.   Don't go here if: If you eat California Rolls or think Panda Express is Japanese food.  Transportation: No parking. Limited Street parking, Ample bike parking. Limited parkades in the area. Best to walk. Public Transit only on Bathurst or Spadina streetcars  Tip: Yellow Tail with Jalapeno and Black Cod Miso are the must trys! I also got the wagyu beef tacos. The peppers is a tastier option than classic edamame. Currently they offer a $50 USD bento box for the Caesar's Palace 50th Anniversary promotion.   The Good, Bad and Ugly Details: If got $200 USD+ budget do the tasting menu. Otherwise, you are robbing yourself of an experience. Skip the Vegas buffet and come here or just don't gamble your life away and spend it here where you know you won't be disappointed.   Yelp Customer Bottom Line: If you made it this far to read my review, count your pennies and save up to come here if you don't anticipate on visiting any other Nobu locations near you.  Business Opportunity: Step up the customer service. Especially considering the brand is part of the Nobu Hotel, it should be a seamless guest experience from the moment a guest books a reservation to paying a bill. Take a learning from Shangri-La Hotels guest services for their diamond members.",

The dishes from the original restaurant have all been \"Vegas-ized\" with sugary catsup like stuff on the shishito peppers, and sweetened tofu that made it taste like a weird dessert. It was so disappointing for all of us. The tuna was passable, but the yellowtail was inedible, and the salmon not so hot either. We were all gagging by the end of the meal.   This experience makes me question whether there is ANY fine cuisine in Vegas, or is it just a mall where all the culinary brands - banking on the ignorance caused by the beyond terrible general level of food in most of the US -- are making people feel like they are eating fine cuisine in huge portions  by designing the space luxuriously and charging 40 dollars for an entree and selling it in huge volume, while just industrializing the recipes and using low quality ingredients. Everything tastes like you are on a cruise. Yuck!  It's worth noting that we had dinner at Nobu in New York a few weeks ago and it was SUPERB!",

The two times that I have eaten at Nobu we told the waiter our likes and dislikes and budget, and he chooses the dishes that come out and the order in which they come.   Honestly, I don't remember everything we ate; all I know is that they were all delicious. Nothing disappointed.   The service is fantastic- helpful staff all around. Polite and warm, they help make the experience better.   Lastly, the atmosphere is great. Upscale without being stuffy.   Make a reservation, save your money, and go to Nobu. You won't regret it.",

I ended up staying in Vegas by myself and decided to treat myself with Nobu. I was worried that people will judge me for being alone at a restaurant but servers and hostess made me feel so comfortable while eating. I chose chef's special where each dish is created by the chef that is not on the menu. After 8 small plates with special 24k dessert they made for me, I was overjoyed with the experience at Nobu. It's worth every penny.",

This is not a casual Vegas strip mall restaurant and people dining in want to see and be seen.  Our waiter greeted us including a boisterous welcome from the Chefs. We ordered the specialty dishes; Yellowtail Jalapeno, White Fish Sashimi, Rock Shrimp, and Tuna Crispy Rice (Yum and Delish)!!  We sat at the bar and enjoyed admiring the chefs feverishly preparing dishes and asking lots of questions. Service was first class and quality of the food is undeniable.

So many restaurants have facilities in common hallways.  Interior: Basic Nobu design.  Nothing special really, chairs and tables are not the most comfy.  Fantastic: -Yuba New Style Sashimi, wonderful, luscious -Field Green Salad, generous portioning and with the ginger soy dressing -Uni and Oyster Shooters, loved, fresh and balanced -Miso Cod in Butterleaf, off menu, always a favorite -Pork Belly Miso, meaty with just the right amount of melt in your mouth fat -Yellowtail Belly SASHIMI, wow, best fish of the evening -Shaved Ice, SO freaking good, something I will order EVERYTIME, perfect  Good: -Toro Tartare with Caviar -Tacos, didn't like the shell, greasy and thick -Inaniwa Pasta with Lobster, good pasta, it's from a package, lobster a TAD underdone -Salmon Belly Sashimi -Otoro, connective tissue, but still melted -Butter mochi dessert, became an afterthought b/c of the shaved ice  Terrible: -House Special Roll, wow SO much rice and it was gummy.  Gross.    Some really good and memorable items.  You will probably get sticker shock and expect to get hungry later.  Nobu dining is definitely something you pay a premium for. Thank you for opening up this location so I don't have to schlep over to the Hard Rock anymore.  I abhor that place.",

Tucked magnificently inside Caesar's Palace, this restaurant provided an amazing and unforgettable experience from every spectrum.  Jonathan was our waiter for the night and he took care of our group in every way possible. We were here for a work conference and we had a moderate budget to work with. He was more than understanding and made sure that having a budget would not take away from our experience at the restaurant. He was right!!  Dishes at Nobu are served family style. Jonathan constructed an 8 course menu for us and every dish he brought out provided an unparalleled experience to our taste buds! My favorite dish of the night must have been either the Black Cod in Miso (his most famous dish) or the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Butter Ponzu sauce.   The kicker was that Chef Nobu was at the restaurant! In my brief moment of meeting him, I would describe him as humble, down-to-earth and genuine. I know I don't know him at all beyond that point but first impressions can be very telling.  If you are new to sushi, be open-minded. More than likely, you will not regret it.   Simply, A+!",

Well...my advise is that if you really wanna try this place ... set a price in your mind, communicate it to your waiter when you arrive and enjoy the experience.   My first time here I was very excited and although I was prepared to pay around $150 per person when you really think about it you start imaging what the hell is worth so much money!. Well we decided to don't look at the menu and we made an arrangement with the waiter....he would bring 6 different dishes inside our budget of $300 a table (2people).  Here is what we had: - Yellowtail with cilantro and jalapeno: good fresh  - Tuna belly sashimi beautiful: explosion of flavours  - Salmon belly: awesome....not as diverse and tasty as the tuna but still great - The black cod: This is his famous dish and OMG...the smell, the presentation, the flavour this dish has a PhD work behind it. Simply amazing!! - Shrimp tempura: ok and filling but not a special experience...you can find it easy anywhere in other sushi spots.  - The sushi Platter, assorted sushi very fresh but again nothing special. - The Dessert was very presentable and with great flavour but something that you can easily skip if you are not a fan of sweets. You'll not be missing much. - To note that the drinks are highly expensive and nothing special. Overall it's an interesting spot for the experience and I would come back here just to seat down and have the cod dish! Other than that of course the quality is high but not worth the abusive price they ask for!.",

In comparing this to Nobu 57 in NYC, both are similar and don't disappoint. However their menus are slightly different and the Las Vegas menu is larger.   They had champagne options for New Years so we started our night with Krug.   We had the following dishes:  Mushroom salad - surprisingly delicious considering mushrooms aren't my favorite food Crispy rice and spicy tuna - such a yummy app, but very salty   Sashimi platter - there are 12 pieces, a nice variety and very fresh Miso cod - this is my favorite dish on their menu, cod is very flaky and tender, while miso is just slightly sweet   Definitely recommend stopping in to Nobu as it's not as heavy a meal as other Vegas options. It's also a lower price point than the NYC location.",

The sushi was amazing and I was really glad we let go of the wheel and let the restaurant do the steering.",

We both ordered the Omakase (a meal consisting of dishes selected by the chef).  My friend had the Chef's Daily Creations while I had the Nobu Signature.  Both orders came out in tapas style dishes and contained appetizers, salads, soups, entrees (beef and fish), and desserts.  My favorite dish was the Black Cod Miso.  The fish was tender and the sauce was sweet and slightly salty and the skin was tasty too!",

Eventually we got seats at sushi bar. Almost 8people was working sushi counter. Appetizer was coming from the back not sushi bar. All appetizer was almost huge size we couldn't eat sushi at all.....Price was two of us including alcohol 220 bucks. All appetizer was delicious. We were satisfied. Thank you so much Rikisann~^^^^",

    "text": "I've been to this Nobu Sushi in the past and it was good enough to come back for a second time. This review is strictly because of our horrible waiter (wish I had his name). He came across as being very impatient because it was some of the girls first time being there. It was a group of 8 girls and I would suppose with any large group you would need to be a little more patient. As he walked by to get everyone's orders of food, he would roll his eyes and look the other way because you can tell he was annoyed that the individual wasn't ready at that exact moment to order their food.  If management needs to know who this individual waiter was, we had reservations on 08/16/15 at 9:30 pm under Polis group. Management needs to really get rid of this guy because what a shame to the restaurant's name.  On top of this horrible service everyone at the table received their dinner and ate their dinner because it came out way before mine. My steak dinner did not come out until everyone was done eating and still waiting for me to receive my dinner.   I will never come back to this service ever again.",

The sushi was delicious, and the sides were great as well such as the sashimi salad and soft shell crab.  I personally am not a fan of the black cod, but many people like it (oh ma gawd ya hafta get da black cawd) can be heard uttered by many a patron.  I prefer to stick to the sushi.  Oh and the drinks are delicious.  When you go to the bathroom, make sure that you remember where your table is.  I got lost as did many I saw coming back from a pee break.",

Sushi- OK but I've had better  In the end, it is still a well orchestrated meal with decent service. I'm not sure it quite lives up to the hype but the miso cod could carry this place on it's back!",

I have eaten at several NOBU's around the country so I figured why not give the newest one inside Ceasars a try.  Pretty much the same menu as the one on the other side of town with a couple other new additions I spotted on their menu. I tried a couple news things but still love my old favorites, the miso glazed cod lettuce cups, the yelowtail jalepeno sashimi, the dry miso swordfish sashimi and the Wagyu tacos. Great atmosphere, great service and great food, but my favorite NOBU is still the one inside Hard Rock across town. This location is much more convienent for anyone staying on the strip.   Pricey but worth every penny, we spwnt about $150 a head including gratuity but we ate like kings. I highly recommend Nobu.",

I'll start by saying that I'm the type of person that'll throw down stupid cash for a good meal, and that was not the case at nobu.  Sat at the bar and wanted omakase.  It was my first time here and I didn't feel like filtering through the menu, nor did I know what was worth trying.  Server shot us down and said it was too late- fair enough, but not really cause they sat a couple RIGHT NEXT to us  ten minutes after we were sat who clearly had omakase.  That was rather painful to watch cause they kept getting dishes I was interested in trying.  Both the server and sushi chef were useless in offering up some suggestions, so I just picked a bunch of stuff from the menu ($400 worth of shit).  Nothing stood out. Fish was ok, not any different from what I could get at kabuto or something.  Kept asking sushi chef to make something worth my while, but maybe I had higher expectations than he, cause he did not deliver.  Was trying to experience nobu the way it was intended to be experienced but that didn't end up happening.  I won't be back. Don't believe the hype. Sushi samba is 10x better.",

Sushi still incredibly fresh. Appetizers tasty to the point that honestly I could just do a few aps with cocktails and be happy! Still try the black cod miso and yellowtail sashimi. You won't be disappointed. I had to shave a star because with a reservation we still waited an hour and  there were kids at the next table raising hell which totally disrupted our meal- staff or patents said nothing. When paying hundreds of $$ fur dinner you shouldn't have to deal with that.",

    "text": "Lucky Las Vegas!! Now you have 2 NOBU's gracing your city! Congrats to Chef Nobu Matsuhisa and his business partner, Robert DeNiro (!!) on their beautiful newest creation..... NOBU at Caesar's Palace, LV!    First, a few fun facts: - The official ribbon-cutting was on February 2, 2013  - Of the 29 NOBU restaurants, this is the largest location worldwide!  - The NOBU Hotel, a \"boutique hotel\" which is next to the restaurant (both in Caeser's) is the first \"NOBU Hotel\" ever! It has 181 rooms, and even features a number of suites with up to 5 rooms. One of these days, I WILL stay here.... the pics of the rooms are gorgeous...and get this, 24-hour availability to Nobu in-room dining room service. Eeeep! ;)    Now, back to the restaurant. You are greeted with an elegant entryway filled with origami birds overhead. Just past the check-in desk, you get a full glance of the beautiful modern & trendy main dining room filled with artistic lamps that look like floating jellyfish. There is a bar and lounge in the front area, sushi bar on the left side, and then the sea of seats filling the rest of the open & spacious layout. There are a variety of different style of seats to accommodate all different sizes of parties..... small tables for the romantic couples, larger booth tables (both circular and square), and secluded tables (in nest-like booth areas) for more private larger parties. There are also secluded areas for the teppanyaki grill tables. Overall, the atmosphere is warm and inviting, which sets the tone for the amazing food you are about to indulge in.  Now, onto the FOOD! Below are the dishes (mostly signature favorites) that me and the hubby had.... Each one was fabulous, and extremely satisfying....!!  1) Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - $28   (a MUST HAVE!) six (heavenly!) thinly sliced pieces of yellowtail, with an even more thinly sliced piece of jalapeno on each. In a light ponzu sauce, and coupled with a piece of cilantro, this combo melts in your mouth and leaves you wanting more. This is my FAVORITE dish. I bet 99% of the people who get this are thinking \"should I order another round now or later?\" as they are finishing off this one ;)   2) Black Cod w/ Miso - $34 (a MUST HAVE!) So succulent & tender....every bite of it literally melts in your mouth! Don't \"pass\" on this one, thinking once you've had a good black cod, you've had em all. NOPE! This one is amazing & you should believe all the hype about it!! The sauce is light & sweet, and I just have a STRONG feeling you will not be disappointed :)   3) Kumamoto Oysters with Nobu Sauce - $18 (a MUST HAVE!) This comes with 3 oysters, each topped with a different garnishing (maui onion, \"las vegas\", and jalapeno). If you have a party of 2, I strongly suggest you get 2 orders so that each person can have their \"own\" trio :) It was super fresh n delicious!   4) Rock Shrimp Tempura - $24 (a MUST HAVE!) OK, so per our server, this signature dish usually comes with either the Creamy Spicy or Butter Ponzu sauce.....but Exec Chef Thomas Buckley (who was brought over from the Miami Beach location) decided to throw in a 3rd sauce choice... Jalapeno! We couldn't decide between the butter ponzu & Jalapeno, so our server offered to bring it out not tossed, but with the 2 sauces 'on the side'. I suggest you do this, as both sauces were amazing and I think you can savor the flavors more with dipping rather than having it mixed in. Served on a bed of micro greens which also tasted good with the sauces.   5) Spicy Miso Chips with Big Eye Tuna - $16 This was tasty but I felt that the plum sauce was a bit too sweet and overpowering. Would have loved this if the sauce was more subtle...   6) Pork Belly Miso Skewer - $14 If you love pork fat, this is your dish! Comes with 2 skewers of incredibly butter-like pork cubes. Tasty, but again I thought there was a lil too much sauce.  My hubby thought it was delicious though!  Dessert We went with one of the most popular picks -- The Bento Box - $15 Flourless chocolate cake, with white chocolate sauce, shiso syrup, and house-made green tea ice cream. Delicious and the perfect way to wrap up a wonderful dinner experience.   I'm already thinking about when I can go back again. Maybe Nobu will consider his next venue in the Bay Area? SF and San Jose would love one!!!!! :oD !!",

My dad likes to order a bunch of things on the menu so we can try it all, especially if the portions are smaller. The server cuts him off and tells him to stop ordering because it's too much food for us...? I have never heard a server tell there table that they are ordering 'too much'. She didn't even say it a nice way, just very bluntly said that. Anyways, our plates came one by one, which was nice because we got to enjoy each piece.  Server rarely checked up on us and didn't care at all. We wish we had the other server that was at the table next to us, she was smiling and giving suggestions to her table, providing very professional service. Food: The quality of the food was very good. The fish was fresh and every plate had its own unique taste. It was perfection. The flourless cake for dessert and coffee with it was perfect touch to end our meal.  Because of the poor quality service we received, especially because we don't mind how much the price is, we will definitely not be returning to this location.",

    "text": "Food: 10/10  Where do I begin on the food here ... I'll try my best to put what I've had into words. I'm rarely at a loss of words when it comes to food... Their menu is designed so you go light to heavy, cold to hot. Each dish, including their sashimi based dishes are a complex explosion of flavors that seems so simple, yet creates this complex enigma of flavor in your mouth. So we started off with assorted fishes prepared in different ways. All of their fish is VERY FRESH and flown in each day. If you're not quite sure on what to order like me, I recommend getting their pre-fixe menus and than swapping things out a-la-carte. Some of the more unique things i had is their fried sticky rice balls. We asked for it along with our Wagyu beef at the end and it was a great pairing as the rice balanced out the sodium of the beef. Their Wagyu Beef (at $30+ an oz.) is simply put, breathtaking. The first bites was one of those rare moments where our group was silent, everyone enjoying a piece of it. Their beef is finished off infront of you with flaming river stones. No that wasn't a typo, they're flaming river stones (check my video if you don't believe me). If you wanted it more then medium rare, it was recommended you leave it on a little bit longer. When they charge you $30+ an oz on beef, you gotta be a little skeptical but the balance of fat, meat, flavor and juice in this beef was just definitely worth it. I recommend everyone trying at least one piece per person! We had around 10 dishes for 6 people so we were a bit full for dessert so can't speak much on that, but the food here at Nobu is definitely worth it! Service: 9/10  I don't usually give service a high rating because my expectations change with each establishment I visit so I don't think it's fair to put them all on the same scale. But here at Nobu, the service, even for a high-level restaurant, was outstanding. Their servers act like an encyclopaedia between you and the chef, explaining the menu and each dish with great detail. They're extremely knowledgable with each dish from describing how the flavors are supposed to mix and how the dish should be best enjoyed to where their ingredients come from and exactly what you're getting. The service here is, simply put, beyond expectations. Overall: 10/10 Additional Notes: Definitely worth coming here! They have nice private booths/tables if you require as well as some Hibachi tables (but from what I can tell, no one does Hibachi anymore). When you come here, be prepared to leave with your stomach enlightened and your wallet lightened.",

    "text": "I had lots of good sushi in my life, but sushi in Nobu is a completely different thing. Everything is so delicious! We had Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Seared Tuna Sashimi Salad with Matsuhisa Dressing, Yellowtail and Scallion Roll, and Valrhona Dark Chocolate Fondant and Imperial Matcha Gelato. I could just not believe how good everything tasted.  All of the food was very good. Service was excellent. I am Europian and still can not get used to the pushi service in the US ( that one gets the check as soon as possible), but the server was present, but let us take our time and enjoy everything. The only downside is the pricing. It is really expensive, but worth the experience.",

    "text": "I'm speechless. Ironically, I have so much to say about this delightful restaurant. This is not Japanese food. Nor is it Peruvian food. Nobu is a cuisine all on its own.  Billy, our server, did a phenomenal job explaining the menu with useful information about anything from the exclusive sake one can only find at Nobu or the freshly juiced cucumbers for the pepino cocktail to the specially crafted plateware and utensils designed specifically for Nobu. He was friendly and trustworthy...which is good because we let him choose our menu.  I won't list everything we ordered (which is A LOT), but I do want to highlight the stars of the show:  - New Style Salmon Sashimi: perfectly fresh, expertly sliced salmon, dusted with sesame seeds, thin julienne of ginger, and splashed with yuzu soy. And then...wait for it....doused with a mixture of hot sesame and extra virgin olive oils. Wow. Just wow.  - Blue Fin Oh Toro Tartare with Golden Osetra caviar: Need I say more? The finest part (the belly) of the finest tuna money can buy topped with decadent, salty sturgeon roe. This is all set in a stringent wasabi-soy vinaigrette (which was so good that I slurped it up after the tuna was gone).  - Black Cod Lettuce Wraps: We also ordered the famous Black Cod Miso which was, of course, melt-in-your-mouth divine. But the manager also brought this interpretation out for us to try. I must say that THIS preparation is the way to go for such a richly fatty dish. The light herbal freshness of the butter lettuce mellows the unctuous richness of the almost stew-like texture of the fish. The thin slices of ginger cuts through the sweet-saltiness of the miso. I can't say enough about this preparation.  - Japanese A5 Wagyu: Cooked on hot stones table side, flambeed with brandy, served with a cracked pepper teriyaki and some seasonal roasted vegetables. I really don't need to say anything else about it. It's True Wagyu: the best beef you can find. Fatty, flavorful, rich. Chef Nobu's genius shines through again by serving it with such an impishly simple, yet perfectly balanced sauce. The veggies were perfectly cooked and delicious as well. Also, the rocks are placed on a bed of kosher salt. I like to take some of that and sprinkle it on the meat for a little added texture and seasoning.  - Tempura shrimp roll: simple and perfect. The rice was balanced, chewy and seasoned well. What really stood out in this lovely morsel was the perfectly blanched asparagus: delicate, crunchy and beautiful bright green. I've eaten this roll a thousand times, but never has it been this good.  - Finally, we have gotten to dessert. The shaved ice was light as a cloud and the mango and green tea syrups that were served along side were tart, sweet and succulent. The best part about this dish was the little bites of fruit and mochi hidden beneath the surface. It was the kind of dessert that got better with each bite. The bento box, however....HOLY CRAPOLA! Again, I've eaten molten chocolate cake a zillion times, but this one takes the...well...cake? I'm not usually one to rave (or even care much) about dessert, but I've never eaten anything as delicious as this. This is THE best dessert I have ever eaten. White chocolate sauce, white chocolate shiso syrup, green tea ice cream and whatever those cookie crumbles are holding the ice cream in place worked so unbelievably well together.  I'm tired of writing. I'm sure you're tired of reading. Go to Nobu. Go there now. You won't be disappointed.",

The server was so arrogant he condescendingly explained some dish to one of our Japanese guests. I just wanted to say dude, really?  Like maybe what the difference was between nigiri and sashimi.

Usually one of my favorites, but I was not as impressed on my last visit here so I think it's teetering between 3 and 4 stars. You must try their signature yellowtail jalapeno sashimi app. Skip the shishito peppers. Rock shrimp tempura is always good. Make sure you ask to try all three flavors. Although I think creamy jalapeno is my favorite. It's hard to pick. The oysters we had were very small which I don't mind, but they over salted them when we went this time.   I think the favorite of the night was the miso cod lettuce cups. Sushi was great. Both mirugai and ikura nigiri had the perfect flavors and texture. Rice was seasoned well and cooked right. Even the seaweed was toasted perfectly. Uni was good.   To end, we had the tempura king crab legs with ponzu. We had a few bottles of echigo and a teapot of house daigingo sake. Our waiter was ok. Total bill came out to be about $650 before tip for our party of 5.",

They tend to have the servers push the $225/person Nobu Experience and push selling full entrees and dining \"family style\" but don't feel pressured to choose that. You still have the option of dining A La Carte, which we did. It is a bit pricey, but the food is great! Service was very quick too. I ordered the crab tempura, which is known as a very popular dish at the Las Vegas Nobu, as well as the Black Cod for my entree! AMAZING! I was so full but kept eating because it was THAT good! The crab tempura seemed like a small serving and I felt like I would still be hungry, and I thought even after the black cod I would still feel hungry, but it filled me up just right! For both my total was $85. The fried rice is only available on the grill table experience, but I also ordered a side of rice. Both dishes I ordered were some of their most popular! Amazing dinner and great service. Also for those going with big groups: they do not split checks. But it was not difficult, our server had us just write our names next to the items we ordered and he used each card for each name, very simple. It was also very easy to find this restaurant! My new fav. Despite having pretty heavy foot traffic, it isn't even that loud in there at all! A MUST go.",

An orgasmic mouthwatering journey about to begin. Monkfish pate topped with caviar was my first on my list.Creamy,smooth,fatty with a slight metallic finish but adding the caviar masked the metallic taste some people don't like.Shrimp and Maine lobster with spicy lemon was my next endeavor.Just like the fireworks light up the Fourth of July,this plate had the same effect on my tastebuds.The lobster was firm,white and opaque,accompanied by the shrimp that had a very firm and crisp texture with the spicy lemon sauce that was drizzled on top,oh mother it's perfect.Half coconut Haupia was the perfect ending.The coconut was warm,supple with mixed berries on a path of light brown sugar crumbs.When the plate came out I didn't think it would work but the flavors married really well.  This definitely is a five star restaurant but I had a slight problem with the caviar which could of been of better grade for the price I was paying.Also our server was real snobby and had the body language of I don't want to serve you cause you don't look like high rollers.Hopefully management fixes some of the attitudes here especially the hostesses who check you up and down when you walk up,whaaat.

After we ordered food she took our food menu twice. It's tapas style restaurant so we wanted to order more but at this point I feel like we are not welcomed here.

    "text": "Don't even think about it, just go. My boyfriend and I finished watching Absinthe on Sunday night and didn't feel like walking too far for dinner so we decided to dine at Nobu. We arrived at 9:30pm with no reservations and they were able to seat us. I would definitely recommend making reservations though.  My first thought when we arrived was how romantic and chill this place is. The ambiance immediately put me a relaxed mood. Now I haven't been to any other Nobu locations so I can't compare, but I really enjoyed our experience here. We started out with an Old Fashioned and Nobu Sidecar. The Old Fashioned was stronggggg. My Nobu Sidecar was deliciously made with Japanese whiskey. Moving on to the foods...  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeo 5/5 - I'm not even a huge fan of yellowtail but this dish was prepared in a little ponzu sauce topped with jalapenos and cilantro (which I also don't like) which all came together so well. Fish was very fresh. Monkfish pate with cavier 5/5 - droolsssssssssss as I'm writing about this dish. So so good. Monfish pate just melts in your mouth. Cavier was delish. Sauce was a little on the sweet side but still good nonetheless. Black cod miso 5/5 - MUST GET! At first we overlooked this until our waiter said this is Nobu's #1 dish. I was definitely glad we got it. Who knew cod can taste so good?! You can definitely taste the miso that is marinated with the fish. We were told it gets marinated for 10 hours. Salmon belly, sweet shrimp, and sea urchin sashimi 3/5 - Don't get me wrong, everything was extremely fresh and good but after trying the previous 3 dishes the sashimi ended up being pretty mediocre. Bottom line - skip the sashimi and get their specialties. Flourless chocolate cake with matcha green tea ice cream 4/5 - chocolate cake has hot lava oozing out of it while the cold ice cream cools everything down; a perfect blend.  This is not a place for the cheap, but it is well worth the splurge for a special occasion. For a couple of dishes, 2 drinks, and dessert, our bill ended up being around $300 for 2. Some may argue it's not worth it but go see for yourself. =)",

When I arrived, I was informed that the chefs wouldn't be available till 9pm, so I had to wait. I wish they could call me in advance to let me know, instead of telling me when I'm already there. But once we were seated, the service was excellent. attentive, efficient and friendly.   Food: we opt for the $190 and $280 set. Both were great. I'm glad we didn't order the same set, so we got to try a little bit of everything.   $190 set: loved the Japanese A5 Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, XO chicken fried rice (liked the chicken more than $280 crab fried rice).   $280 Set: loved the lobster, scallop with uni, Foie Gras (the best!), Foie Miso Cappuccino. Didn't like the crab fried rice, was a bit fishy somehow.   Loved the bottle of sake as well.   Bill came about $700 for 2 people, but it is worth it :)",

    "text": "Believe the hype!  I actually went to Nobu in NYC probably 7 years ago and I remember it being very good, but didn't recall how very good it is.   My wife and I went to the Caesars Palace location before a show the other night. Even at 6pm it was filling up quickly, so if you want to go at a more typical Vegas dinner time, make a reservation several days ahead of time. Or do what my wife and I do often, sit at the bar.   We shared two cold dishes and one hot dish. The yellowtail with jalapeno, and the dry miso snapper for the cold dishes. Both extremely good. The servers do a great job of presenting each dish with instructions on how to best enjoy them. For example, for the yellowtail, the server who brought the dish said \"the chef recommends a little of the cilantro on each slice.\"  Take their advice for sure.   For the hot dish we had their signature miso black cod. Wow. So good!  I really like how the cooks take so much pride in the presentation, and the servers take the time to talk to you about the dish.   Cade, our bartender, provided great service and he is the one who recommended what we got. He is an excellent bartender.   Sometimes we have all been disappointed by a place that has so much hype. Not the case here.  Put this one on your bucket list.   **Update**  Went again last night (9/8/17).  We sat at the bar and Toshih was our bartender. He was awesome. Had the Red Snapper, Miso Cod, Alaskan Crab Tempura, and an off menu Yellowtail special roll that Toshih recommended. All were to die for. I just can't get over how good the dishes are at Nobu. Truly one of the best restaurants in America if not the world.",

Our waiter delightfully walked us through the intricate menu with decorum and tended to us consistently through the evening. We began with a sashimi plate that was gone within seconds.  The wagyu tacos we ordered next disappeared quickly as well, but taste lasted in our memory for the rest of the evening.  Easily the best bite of my life. This was my second time here the first time was darn good but the second time seemed way better most likely because the girl I was with was far more pretty and fun but the food also seemed better. 10/10",

I started comparing each plate I had and it was obvious that Nobu had better plates.  We started with cocktails and the first plate was the must have yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  The yuzu sauce that they put on here is delicious and the texture of the yellowtail says quality.  The next one was the anticushos I didn't think they were anything special but my wife loved them. The waiter told us to try the black cod miso I believed it to be a bit pricey for the plate. My wife did not like she thought it was too sweet I thought it was delicious I love miso and black cod it melts in your mouth.  I had the big eye tuna sashimi as well and though it was one the best I have ever had and would get more if I had time. We had several other sushi rolls that were plain but the yuzu sauce makes the difference.",

    "text": "Nobu blew my mind! Not only it had amazing food, the service was absolutely outstanding. You are served by at least 5 people in addition to your waiter, and every staff member walking by is trained to ensure your dining experience is flawless.  To start with, I wore a little black cocktail dress to the restaurant, and when I settled, there were white napkins on the table. My white napkin was quickly removed, and a black napkin put in its place. (!!!!). My husband dropped his napkin without noticing, and a passing by staff member put a clean napkin next to his plate, picked up the dropped one and disappeared. And in everything from bringing food out to refilling your drinks, to taking the empty plates away, Nobu provided the most authentic service we have ever experienced  Now to the food - Nobu is known for Japanese cuisine infused with Peruvian flavors. Every morsel of fish explodes with flavors in your mouth. Cocktails are unique and flavorful. The green tea is only surpassed by the tea we had in Japan.  The menu was difficult to navigate for a Nobu newby, but to make your selection less stressful, there is a pre-selected chef menu and you server can select food for You, based on your preference and price.  We asked for fish only, and around $125 per person, and thoroughly enjoyed the food they brought us. The most memorable were the sashimi style dishes with raw slices of fish served with different sauces. Yellow tail jalapeno was a treat. Miso salmon. The presentation was also top notch. We will definitely be back when in Vegas next. One word of warning - if wearing heels, the tile floor on the way to the ladies room is very slippery. Walk slowly. :)",

They put on the hockey game for us.   I got the chef's omakase for $175 and it was worth every single cent and decadent morsel of goodness.  It was nine courses. Seven cold and two hot. And I had about 14 different types of seafood - fish varieties and shellfish. Every single one was so tasty. Everything except two nigiri and the sample of yellowtail with jalapeno were off the menu so worth the customized experience.   Splurge on the wagyu. It's like eating butter and succulent meat fat.  And at $38 an ounce it's really not that expensive because it's so filling and better to savor a little than gorge on a lot.   My friends split a bottle of wine -$80 and it was really good. Semi sweet. Semi dry.   I had 3 cocktails including the award winning purple rain. SO GOOD! I'm a big fan of sweet drinks that are aesthetically pleasing so I loved the huge blood orange (purple colored) ice cube. Mango passionfruit drink was also great and very sweet. The Peruvian caipirinha is perfect for people who like ginger beer and a slightly spicier profile.   Service was top notch. I assume at the tables too but because we were at the bar we had several people always around to attend to our requests.",

    "text": "Be forewarned, yes the food here is pricey, so most of you wonder if the food really worth it's price? I believe it is, and this was only my 2nd time here.  I made a reservation for 1 at 8pm on Monday, and was seated as soon as I showed up at 7:50pm.   The first time was right before New Years in December and that time I had the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase for $225/pp with 2 other people. However, this time I had the $150 Nobu Signature Omakase (was $125 in 2017).  This 7 course plus soup and dessert tasting menu is well worth it and was much different from the Chef's Daily Creations Omakase.  Before choosing the Omakase, I decided to go with the Kikori Old Fashioned cocktail which Yesenia, my server procured for me quite quickly. I ended up drinking a total of 2 over the course of my meal. The Kikori Old Fashioned is highly recommended if you like whiskey and Old Fashioneds. The serving size is worth it for its price.  The service throughout the whole tasting menu was superb, so if you are willing to do an Omakase please set aside at least 1 hour and 45 minutes to fully enjoy the meal and all the courses.  From my calculations all the food I received cost $230 with portion size taken into account.  My top 3 favorite dishes throughout this tasting were the aged Bluefin tuna, toro tartare, and black cod miso.   The aged Bluefin tuna was unlike any other tuna nigiri I've had, it melted in my mouth and had so much flavor that I've never experienced before. As a sushi lover, this is a must each time you go to Nobu.  The toro tartare, was something I initially did not expect to like, however after the first scoop, I was amazed at the blend of the sauce, toro, and caviar.  The signature black cod miso, was just as expected. Cooked perfectly, portioned well, and had extra sauce if you want more flavor. It's a must at Nobu if you want one of his signature dishes.  The other dishes were also superb, but those 3 stood out in my opinion.  To finish out the tasting menu the chocolate molten lava cake paired with fruit and green tea ice cream was icing on the cake to end the meal.  Overall the SIgnature Omakase tasting menu has less food than the Chef's Daily Creations, but is well worth it if you have never been to Nobu and would like to taste what he's known for.  Now having done both, I might order a la carte, or do another tasting just for the value.",

We got there for around 5PM and NO reservation and it was slowly getting crowded....but still only about 35% full.. They could seat us in 10 minutes at the sushi bar or 20 minutes at a table. We took the sushi bar. In word the night was \"A+W+E+S+O+M+E\". We both othered a tasting menu (3 hot dishes + 3 cold dishes ie sushi + dessert) for $155 per person. We were not disappointed! The sushi was made in front of us...very fresh - creative - tasty. The highlight was their Black Cod (a star dish at NOBU) and it's definitely a top 5 dish ANYWHERE in my opinion. We were actually getting short on time so they brought us a Vegan Creme Brulee for dessert (instead of cake). Total bill was $355 + $100 tip = $455.00 and well worth it.",

It was our last night in Vegas with just two friends left who had flown in to see me from Florida (yes, they're awesome).  We had some Saki at the bar.  We talked to some people at the bar -  from LA I think..(it was my birthday a month ago leave me alone).  We ordered OFF menu.  We trusted out server.  We trusted our Itamae (Chef).    It.  Was.  Phenomenal.  So good.   He kept us under the price point was asked, offered a fantastic array of options, and kept us full on drinks.  I'm so glad I went back and let the server \"dictate\" what we would have (did't have that freedom on the first trip).  Such a good idea.  I'd give 6 stars if I could...sorry I don't have photos, but you should go.  If you don't mind a bit of an up charge (location and tourists) it's so worth it but real easy $100/person if you're really enjoying the place and drinking.  Honestly the best I've had.",

All the bars at Caesars was packed and we remembered Nobu, and the bar was quiet on a Saturday night. I forget the bartenders name but he was a young man and was very knowledgeable and even customized our drinks. I had a MIA MARGARITA  and my wife had some sort of Seasonal Horchata drink. They were awesome! If you looking for a quiet place to take a date for drinks, this is it! We will be back in a few months!",

I've been to the San Diego, Hong Kong and Miami Nobu and the Las Vegas Nobu is definitely the best one! The waiters are very friendly and always recommend off menu dishes to me which I love!   This time we had an off menu roll that had salmon and asparagus in it. It is one of my favorites.   I love Yuzu on everything!!! Always have the yellowtail jalapeno and various other sashimi dishes. The crunchy rice with spicy tuna on top is my all time favorite! Of course you can't have  without some refreshing Sapporo!  Nobu never disappoints !",

We order one Cheft's special 8 courses $125, & 1 Sashimi plate $64, & 2 glass of wines $30. The service here is good but the fresh raw fishes are not that fresh espically the Sashimi plate & the varity of the fish are nothing special, it's all standard & cheap stuffs.  Regarding the Cheft's special 8 courses which are nothing suprised me. Base on the price at least should have either sweet shrimp, raw oyster, uni or humbochi. I feel it's over value after spending almost $300 In here. I think this is the only one time stop restaurant. There are so many Japanese restaurants in US are not only food guality is fresher than here but also price. I wouldn't come back again.",

    "text": "First visit, loved it!  Initially the menu seemed a little hard to digest, did we want to share family style or go solo, then we considered the set menus.   We ended up going with the Nobu classics omakase dinner and it was 8 courses of sheer delight.  The set menu was majority sushi/ raw fish preparations with a few cooked dishes (one fish and one beef), a soup and a lovely dessert.   Service was excellent and well balanced between efficient and friendly.   This menu was $125 a person so not a bargain bite spot. However considering the setting (glam casino Maine dining) and the amazing experience it felt like a good value. I was getting full about 2/3 of the way through the courses and everything seemed high quality, perfectly prepared and bursting with interesting flavor combinations.   Now having tried everything I might zero in on a couple dishes, but honestly the variety and fun of the small bites was something I would do again.",

    "text": "Finally checked this place off my bucket list this past weekend. I must say, I expected a little bit more from such a notorious restaurant.  Perhaps this is frivolous, but I absolutely could not overlook the details of the interior. The ambience felt a little economical with the honey-comb paper lanterns that hung intrusively above the table space. The longer you stare at them, the more obvious the imperfections of craft comes forth. A little out of place for an upscale sushi restaurant.   Aside from the surroundings, the food was stellar. Quality ingredients, down to the seaweed which had the most pleasant nutty, briny essence, far more unique than the commercial brands that local sushi restaurants use.   Offering a wide range of items, the menu spanned from imported wagyu gyoza, ceviche, to meat skewers. Sushi was what tantalized me, therefore I sampled the Sushi Dinner consisting of 8 pieces of sushi and 1 tuna maki. The tuna was definitely revelational. I've never had tuna that had the taste and texture like the variety at Nobu. I've distanced myself from commercial tuna from as long as I remember due to the chalky and chewy texture, but at Nobu, the tuna tasted like a different species altogether--a must try!  I was a little confused by the salmon, which had a floundering texture, dissolving instead of melting in my mouth. It contrasted with what I was expecting and kind of threw me off guard, a bit yucky to be honest.  The rest of my platter was as expected. I quite enjoyed the octopus nigiri, which was soy-sauced and sprinkled with sesame. It had a satisfying bouncy texture and tasted balanced with the rice and freshly grated wasabi. Also notable was the mackerel. Unlike the commonly stringy and overly pickled variety found at other establishments, this mackerel was delicate and natural with muted acidity.   Our table of six had a fabulous dining experience embellished with great service and conversation. If I'm every in Vegas again, I'd definitely stop by again to have another round of sushi!",

From little king crab tacos to Japanese red snapper to the simplest item like miso soup is party to your Taste buds. Items are small portions and priced accordingly but I assure you it will be money worth spent. If you are staying at Cesar's palace and You are as such of a Sushi fan then this place is your home.

Chef Nobu has merged Japanese cuisine with Peruvian (and some Argentinian) styles of both preparing and cooking.    My husband and I love Peruvian and Japanese - so together this place is a dream.    The service was impeccable, prompt and delightful.    Some things off the menu were very good and some were very bad.   The good: the mixed seafood.  Similar to Peruvian Ceviche.  Plentiful, too.  The Spicy seafood soup.  Nice and hot and full of forever garlic.  Perfect for a cold night.    The bad: We let our server convince us to try the Cod.  We should have known better.  It was not good.    We were in a hurry to catch Absinthe and I was not finished with my wine.  Our server gave me my wine in a Casino glass and we were on our way.    My only complaint is they did not have Japanese sparkling wine.  This is a huge fail IMHO.  Our server did explain that they were working on changing that little mishap since so many people were asking for it... Yup.  So 4 stars until then.    Kanpai!   ()!",

    "text": "So first off, this is place is very expensive.  On sashimi, prawn tempura and  2 vegetable rolls I spent $88, just by myself.  So the ambience is quite lovely.  Dark and with beautiful lanterns.  It is a fusion of a modern and classy restaurant with Japanese influence.  I had the yellowtail sashimi...which is amazing!  I would definitely order it again. It's a must try signature disk by Nobu.  I also ordered prawn tempura, which was good but it only had two pieces.  I finished off with an avocado and cucumber roll. Which were good, but not worth the price.  Everything was a little over priced...but you're paying for the experience and ambience.  My waiter was very informative and professional but right off the bat he tried to get me to order a sampling menu, which is not what I was interested in.  So I cut him off and asked if i could order off the menu...which of course I  could.  So overall, unless you are sushi lover like myself, you may not want to spend money on Nobu.  I'm all about good food and the experience, so I was satisfied.  I would probably go back, but I'll probably go to the one in Malibu.  ps- I made reservations way in advance for 7pm on a Friday night",

    "text": "I must first say that I was mislead by their online menu.  I was unaware of the EXTREMELY small portion sizes for each dish and that you are meant to get at least 2 to 3 items off of each section of the menu. I glanced at the prices to get an idea of what I was in for before making reservations. That being said, I am aware that does not reflect on the quality or the dining experience. The food itself was good (I highly recommend the tuna tataki). However, you get next to nothing for the price. What you do get however, is a very loud atmosphere (think open walls so that the noise of the casino spills over into the quiet, dimly lit setting of the restaurant), and service leading much to be desired. When we informed our server (who looked distracted and slightly as if we were bothering him the whole time, not cracking so much as a smile once) that this was our 1st time, he spent all of 15 seconds explaining the very complicated menu. He also became even less interested in us when we only ordered about $200 worth of food, when he clearly would have like for us to order $250 per person. To his credit, our waters stayed filled and the food came very quickly. But the noise meant we could barely talk, despite the romantic setting. We ended up ordering 2 items from the cold menu (tuna tataki and 2 bite size salmon tacos), 1 from the hot (creamy spicy rock shrimp that was just a step up from bar food), and 2 sushi rolls (very soft rice but overall forgettable), spent almost $200 and ended up getting burgers afterwards because we were so hungry ,which is just crazy. Overall notes? Do your homework first, and be prepared to drop $400 or more easily, but also to not be able to speak to each other or enjoy the atmosphere.",

    "text": "Ventured out of our comfort zone, to the Nobu.  Someone told us about the Wagyu beef which started us on our journey.  Bottom line -- the layers of ingredients was simple but amazing.  We typically eat a light dinner, so we knew we wouldn't break the bank ... but you could if you wanted.  We started with the cucumber salad.  Simple and delicious.  The Wagyu beef tacos were a great way to taste this delicacy.  (A full steak, no matter how good, isn't within our preferred diet.)  Onto the chicken skewers.  This was our \"main\" course.  The chicken was surprisingly fatty, which is a turn-off for me, but the spicy sauce got me through it.  My favorite item were the tempura vegetables.  Perfect.  Lastly, the waiter suggested the Bento Box desert.  A flourless chocolate cake with white chocolate syrup oozing from it, fresh berries and green tea ice cream.  We don't usually have desert right after dinner, but this sounded so outrageous we had to try it.  Had we not had the dessert I would have felt the meal okay.  The dessert put the whole meal into a class of its own.    Our waiter moved the rating from 3 to 5.  He was one of the best waiters we've ever had.  Not only was Matthew patient with novices, but very knowledgeable and very smooth on suggesting different items (the Bento Box was one he suggested).  He recognized our simple palate and cheerfully went with it.  Thanks much!",

We tried a number of different dishes from each section of the menu and everything was exceptional.    Our server, though young, was incredibly knowledgeable about the wine selection as well as their extensive menu.  I really could not ask or expect better service from a server or his accompanying busser and runner staff.  Nobu is deserving of the \"$$$$\" as is listed.  Expect to spend a decent amount of cash.  I am only disappointed with price when the service or food does not match. Our tab for two with a tasty bottle of wine and a nice selection of food was $270 + tip, but it was worth every penny.",

I dont mind paying a high price if its worth it... But... We ordered omakase... 2 of them.. Our bill was $300... One of our courses was miso soup..really?... We just dropped 300 bucks and you guys are serving us soup? Severely disappointing when the soup came toward the end. The sushi course with a few different pieces of fish didn't taste quite right... which is why i asked for soy sauce... But everyone insisted i taste the fish and it would be overpowering... The salmon course and cod were wonderful but not worth that price tag. Lastly the lava cake for desert wasnt even that great considering the ones i just picked up from Trader Joes earlier this week were better...We wont be back for that price with that quality of food... RIP OFF...",

    "text": "A Horrendous Experience I need to begin by saying that I have been to Nobu restaurants in over eight locations worldwide.  I was at his first USA restaurant in NYC shortly after it opened.  I have always had an excellent experience until I dined at Nobu in Caesar's with two co-workers.  Yes, it is pricey...everything on the Vegas Strip is pricey and price was not the issue. Not being served your entree was the issue.  I sat patiently while everyone was eating their food...there was a gap of about 15 to 20 minutes between when the first person's entree was served to when the second person received theirs.  So, we all assumed my entree would arrive in the same time frame. So, I sat there...waiting. Our server was nowhere to be found.  Finally, when everyone else had finished their meals our server finally showed up and I inquire about my food status.  She looked shocked and said that it might take a bit longer. In the meantime she offered me a sushi roll...promising me that it would take 5 minutes to arrive...20 minutes later the wrong roll arrives.  I ate it anyway.  20 minutes after that an entree was delivered to my table...the wrong entree.  15 minutes later, my entree does arrive....cold.  No apology from the server.  However, she did make a point of telling us that the entree was removed from the bill.  The manager was called over, who again did not apologize and truly he did not care that I was leaving his restaurant without eating but did volunteer to take a whopping 20% off the bill.  Therefore, we all left Nobu with a bad taste in our mouths and me with an empty stomach.",

    "text": "My husband, sister, and I went to Nobu while on a trip to Las Vegas.  The atmosphere was really pretty, and our service was excellent.  Our waiter was friendly, professional,  and extremely knowledgeable about the menu.  He suggested that because the menu is so large, that if we were interested we could just give him our budget and preferences, and he would design a meal for us.  We decided to do that, and it was fun being surprised by each course.  The food is beautifully presented, and we loved the unique preparation of the sashimi dishes.  The chefs incorporate flavors such as citrus and cilantro, which is something I've never had at a Japanese restaurant.  The black cod melts in your mouth and is a must when dining here. I'd also highly recommend the rock shrimp.  There was a wonderful beef dish, and for dessert the huge mound of shave ice with two syrups, berries, and mochi was impressive and not too heavy.  The food and service were top of the line, so why am I giving it only 3 stars, you ask?  The answer is the prices.  I am talking about $18 beers.  I am talking about $10 bottles of water (and we would have been happy with tap water).  To give you an idea of how pricey this place is, our food bill was $200 but the drinks and tip added another $200.  That would be easy enough to do, but we were not sitting around drinking ourselves under the table.  Between the three of us we had one glass of sake and four beers.  Five drinks, that is all!  Be careful if you decide to dine here.  You could very easily go broke, as it's one of the most expensive, if not THE most expensive, place I've ever been to.",

Our table was so small and in the middle of the aisle near the door to the ktchen.So my huband asked if we could have another table.The Hostess left us standing there, looking so out of place, and went to check. A few minuets later, she comes back and tells us the only tables are for big parties and this is it and advises not to wait. So we sit dowm. 5-10 minutes later someone finally comes over for what we want to drink. Well I know Nobu is expensive, but $20 bucks an up for a drink. We looked at each other and walked out. We are probably the only people that have walked out. Went to another resturant and had a great dinner for 1/2 the price with very nice and fun waiters and hostess.",

OH my God, I wish I would have done it sooner. Even if you do it just once, just once it would be a worth wild experience. The quality of fish is the best I have ever had, and the Wagyu beef was the knock out punch. I wouldn't have thought to have tried any meat in sushi place, but on the servers recommendation we did. Overall just a fabulous experience, from the time we walked in till we left. The people that work there are top notch! Not understanding the negative reviews, comments that there is nothing special, or reviews from \"prego's\" who shouldn't even be eating/reviewing a sushi place to begin with since they can't even eat anything that's not cooked??? Bottom line skip the ayce a couple times and get in there and give it a try. You won't be disappointed.",

The Nobu at Caesars Palace however, is a close second.   The ambiance is relaxing. The lighting is dim without being too dark. I'm always impressed with how quiet it is even when it's really busy. It's refreshing to not have to yell across the table to have a conversation.   The food of course is to die for. Every dish is a work of art. As a photographer and visual person, I tend to eat with my eyes first. I usually get the same thing each time but occasionally branch out and try something new.   If you can't decide what you want it's always fun to let the chef choose for you. Just tell them the types of sushi you usually gravitate towards and they bring you a feast!   I recommend the White Fish Tiradito. The sauce is tangy with a little bit of a kick! Also try the Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna. The presentation is genius. The crispy rice comes in little cubes that act as serving trays for the tuna. The tuna is reminiscent of a mixture of ingredients you might find in a spicy tuna roll, but of course the quality is totally amplified.",

From the very beginning when Chef Matsuhisa was cooking in his restaurant on La Cienega in LA to New York or Las Vegas we always come out filed with joy, content and happy.

Service was excellent but as usual the price was ridiculous! we will keep coming back as long as you keep putting this kind of quality food on our plate. All the best",

Food and service excellent but for that price I have had some exquisite meals..........and this one wouldn't reach that category.  I know it's fairly new and famous but really?  $300+??  And that wasn't for the most expensive meal.  Prix fixed menu pricing at different levels and some ala carte pricing.  So you CAN spend more.  Menu includes everything from soup to appetizer to dessert, along with main course obviously.  Desert fantastic.  Our chef was a bore compared to one at table next to us.  He was nice but NOT entertaining as he should have been.  He did answer questions as to recommendations and explained food choices.    Located in Ceasars and the newer Nobu hotel.  I say try it once IF you can afford it and want a japanese Teppanaki style dinner but I will NOT be back for a second experience at this price.

As a vegan, I was thoroughly impressed when the server was completely understanding and helpful in picking out many choices. In addition to having Tofu Toban-Yaki, he explicitly stated that the chef could prepare a multitude of dishes with vegetable/protein substitute!  I ordered the Omakase: Nobu Signature Menu Tasting option (Normally costing $125, while the vegetarian option cost $100). It came with 8 courses (desert included). Their skill showed, as they essentially gave me the same experience a regular customer would receive with that meal option. The vegan desert was also to die for.  The only downside is that most dishes are small portioned and high prices, save some $10-15 dishes.  Either way, excellent food and experience.",

It began with sushi (not americanized sushi with crazy sauces) that was incredible. Simple, but complex flavors, elegantly prepared.  We moved on to Nobu's famous miso black cod. Every bite was exquisite.  We moved on to the beef course, which was also incredible, before dessert.    If you're a sushi fan, this is the ultimate destination.",

I made a reservation for the Nobu in the Hard Rock and ended up in the Nobu at Cesars Palace, they didn't have a table, but they accomodated us at the Sushi Bar and I can't say I was dissapointed.  Watching these guys perform their craft is pretty entertaining.   Two things that changed my view of food forever, the Kobe Beef (at $38 an oz) and the tuna belly (which absolutely melted in your mouth, literally).  There was also the Aboloni (which was delish!)   I mean, you know when you go to Nobu you'll get a good meal. I would suggest it for anyone who intends on sharing a special occasion with a special someone, because it ain't cheap :)  Also, I forgot to add that the service is impeccable! Amazing!",

    "text": "Warning: TL;DR. At last I got to experience the great food that Nobu has to offer! You have no idea how excited I was to try out one of the many Nobu restaurants. And let me tell you this, this was definitely THE best fine dining experiences I have had (And I have been blessed to have quite a few). Yes, it is super expensive. But people, come on, see the Yelp $$$$ sign and go through the menu because they do list prices before you decide to dine here. Expect to pay anywhere between $100-$150 per person.  Our experience was wonderful right from the get go. We had reservations for 2 at 10PM on Saturday, 1/30/16. We planned on dining here after catching a show, but we got out of the show sooner than we expected. Since we were staying at the Nobu hotel, it was convenient to just walk up and ask if they could seat us earlier. Ashley at the front desk was helpful and did get us an earlier reservation and called us about the same. Our table was phenomenal. We got one of the booth like tables, with a view of the bar and virtually every other table. This was perfect for people watching while enjoying our meal ;-) Amber was our assigned waitress for the night. And she definitely contributed to making it great by making recommendations and good ones at that. She wasn't pushy and explained things when we had questions. And we had a few, given that the food at Nobu is a Peruvian Japanese blend. So, it's not just sushi, sashimi and miso based items, they also have tacos with a Japanese influence and ceviche. I also found out that Tiradito is basically a ceviche as well! Nobu doesn't really have very many warm sakes on their menu. They aren't known for their sake. So, if you are a sake connoisseur, head to barMASA instead. We ordered the only warm sake they have to offer. But it did hit the right spot. We also ordered sake based cocktails. I ordered one was with coconut water and my husband with Japanese whiskey (Yamakazi). Unfortunately, the cocktails were unimpressive.   We didn't opt for the Omakase style dinner or the family style dinner. It just seemed like a lot of food for the two of us. If you are a bigger group, you could opt for either one of these. We opted to order off the menu straight. Between the two of us, we tried: Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno - This is the BOMB. the Yuzu sauce was perfectly complementing the sashimi. And the sashimi basically just melted in our mouths. Be sure to add a leaf of cilantro on top of the jalapeno and bite it all together. Flavors just burst in your mouth. Shishito Peppers - These are a must order at Nobu. The sesame sauce atop the peppers adds a wonderful flavor. We ordered 2 of these! Scallops with Wasabi pepper - This dish was a bit underwhelming. It's more gravy style and would probably be fantastic with a side of rice. But it is something that I can make at home. Not worth forking the monies on. Uni Nigiri - Having lived in SF and experienced fresh uni here, I had my expectations of what it should be like perfectly set - creamy avocado like without the fishy taste. And I kid you not, the uni at Nobu lived upto my expectations. It was perfect! Order this for sure. Big eye tuna nigiri - My husband ordered a piece of this and it just disappeared. Vegetable tempura - Now I am not a sushi/sashimi snob. But after you've consumed sushi and sashimi with seafood, the vegetable option seems like a downer and a sheer waste of money. But my husband still wanted his veggies. And the tempura here is perfectly fried and not oily at all. Spicy Scallop roll - I didn't taste much spicy or the scallop. The green onion flavor overpowered the rest. It tasted great overall. For dessert, we ordered the fried banana with sesame ice cream. This just hit the spot!  I think more than anything else, what impressed me was the service we received. Everyone from the seating hostess to our waitress to the food servers and the manager on duty, everyone was extremely courteous and very attentive. I do want to check out the other Nobu locations. But overall, we had a great experience and definitely a night to remember!",

    "text": "So let me start off with the reality that this place has A+ food. The restaurant has great lighting and the sound is perfect for conversation over dinner. So you may ask why I gave it 3 stars...  If you are attempting to give a good dining experience, you should make sure staff is aware of this. Having to get out of the way of staff while they are walking and dodging staff walking backwards is not the attention to detail I expect. Also, asking if the seating is desirable for the party or desire to seat elsewhere is good etiquette (having been seated in the middle of a near empty restaurant, when better seating is available). Finally, the waiter made a point to talk about the fusion of Japonessa and Peruano cuisine... besides the one line of ceviche, not much of a nod to Peru.   Don't let this review dissuade you from trying this place. Highly recommend the rock shrimp tempura and wagyu beef tacos. Food is good, just need to step up their level of service.",

I will say, compared to some of the other locations the same dishes are a little bit pricier, which is what I expect at a restaurant which is this busy.   I will say, one of my die hard favorite dishes is this weird heart of palm salad.... I literally crave it. I dont know what it is I have to have it, and it keeps me coming back to Nobu (and of course their other food is delicious).

I've done the Nobu Signature before, so I wanted something different and the $225.00 menu did not disappoint. So many creative courses, and I had so much food that I didn't think I'd be able to finish it all, but I did, and thoroughly enjoyed the experience!!  Atmosphere - Beautiful, chic, and modern. Note, though, that it does get very busy as the evening progresses, so the noise level naturally escalates accordingly.  Service - I dined solo here, and received wonderful, attentive service. However, as the restaurant got busier the attentiveness slightly dropped as well.  Love this place, even more so than Nobu New York City.",

There are so many interesting structural elements in one space, whether it be the light fixtures hanging from the top of the ceiling, or the semi-enclosed pods along the edge of the restaurant.   Nobu is all about the experience really. With a variety of items on the menu, I highly recommend going in a big group, everyone getting some things and sharing items. It's an experience of many senses: sight, smell and taste. If you came to Nobu to dine on a budget, don't. The bill won't be cheap, but you will be full. You're not coming here every day, so if you come, be prepared to splurge.",

We always order chefs special with some customization when we come here and that's the best way to go ($200-250 per person). It consists of 8-9 dishes to share including appetizers, sashimi, cooked fish, cooked meat, nigiris, and dessert. We also drink at least a bottle of wine and plus. Servers there are amazing (I.e. Heather, Tyler) and seriously the best service in town.",

    "text": "Been loving Nobu forever & honestly, the Nobu Hotel is the best on the strip.  (Refer to my Nobu Hotel review)   Jono, our server & managers behind the bar... fantastic!  They are why I updated my four star Toban-Yaki experience to five.  Two totally different experiences.    Start w/ a large hot sake cause I promise many of these dishes are complimented by it.    In order of the BEST most consistently delish Nobu MUST:  TIRADITO SEA URCHIN:  Best in Las Vegas.  Creamy melt in your mouth fresh served on top of a thinly sliced cucumber.  Taste bud organism.  KING CRAB LEG W/ AMAZU PONZU:  Very lite tempura, doesn't overpower the beautiful succulent crab.  Perfectly cooked & plated so make sure to mix the whole dish up before devouring so you get the whole experience.  I usually get it w/ no red onion, just my preference when I'm not sharing.   BLACK COD MISO:  Melt in your mouth like butter.  It's flaky like seabass & complimented by the sweetness of the miso glaze. The signature glow stick looking garnish is a tasty radish so try it.  AHI TUNA MISO CHIPS:  A burst of flavors!  The ahi is so red & juicy it's like it was just caught & to pair it w/ a chip, wow!  Order it every time now.    YELLOWTAIL JALAPENO:  Lite fresh, thinly sliced & beautiful.   The Artichoke Salad, Seafood Soup, Kelp Salad & Octopus Sunomono are all nice starters or sides.  The Dry Miso Spinach Salad is an acquired taste, but it's good.    Rock Shrimp is filling so I never order that since their are so many other dishes & the SoftShell Crab on Watermelon is seasonal.    You can't go wrong w/ the sashimi ever & the fresh water eel is devine.    After my Toban experience, I never get anything from the grilled section & always ask for their signature dish cause the one at HR has a beautiful Yellowtail Red Snapper in Coconut milk baked & then fried.  I like that each one has a special that's off the menu.  The one at Caesars didn't really appeal to me.",

Our friendly and informative waiter gave us a brief history of Nobu and one of the things that we learned was that the cuisine is actually a Japanese-Peruvian fusion! If you are expecting to have traditional Japanese sushi, you might be disappointed.  However, if you walk in expecting a  creative dining experience, I think you will really enjoy it here. All of the ingredients used were very fresh, and the combination of flavours was amazing and unexpected. We ordered the Chef's Creations Omakase and the Signature Omakase.  The Chef's Creations was $225 and the Signature was $150. The price difference is in the ingredients (ie. Blue fin tuna vs. amberjack). This is a lot of food, so make sure you are hungry! Overall, delicious food, very creative, energetic environment, and good wait staff.",

We made a reservation for 7:45, and arrived a bit early, but luckily scored seats at the bar to sit and soak in the Nobu ambiance prior to arriving at our table. We all settled on the rose ($15/glass), and hung out at the bar until the hostess came over to bring us to our table.   Everything about Nobu is sexy - the pods with couches, the low lighting, the tables that are a bit low to the ground.. it's just a beautiful and completely sensory experience.   Everything at Nobu is designed to be shared, if you aren't as greedy as we were and decide to opt for that. We decided to order a cold dish, hot dish, and sushi rolls to share, and then each order an entree.   You can also select Omakase, if so desired, which is always a nice option to have when you're indecisive.   We started with the famous, and according to our server, most popular Nobu cold dish, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno ($29 for 6 pieces). It was the perfect start to the meal, and I honestly feel like I could have eaten an entire plate of it. It was so clean, so fresh, and the jalapeno/sauce on the plate combo was perfection. They'll also allow you to order a few extra pieces depending on the size of your party, so that each person can get two pieces (or they recommend order an additional order of it). Honestly, this is what I will dream of when I picture food heaven.   We also ordered a spicy cauliflower with jalapeno dressing, and then sushi rolls (spicy tuna, yellowtail and jalapeno, and shrimp tempura). All came out at different times and were delivered to the center of our table, and all were devoured almost instantly. The cauliflower was the perfect level of spicy, and the sushi was deliciously fresh and rolled beautifully.   For an entree, I ordered the scallops with wasabi pepper, and my colleagues each ordered a different dish as well, so if we wanted to try something new, it was available to us. The scallops were perfection - cooked beautifully, surrounded by a ton of delicious vegetables, and the most gorgeous level of spice. Seriously, it's 9 AM EST right now, and I'm dreaming of this amazing dinner.  In lieu of dessert, we each ordered another drink (another rose for me, champagne for the rest of the group), to round out a night of indulgence.   Nobu is truly the epitome of elevated dining - the food is unparalleled, the service is wonderful, drinks are delicious and well poured, and ambiance is stunning. It's a wonderful treat for a night out, and one that I cannot wait to return to.",

    "text": "I loved this place. We made reservations for 4 people at 5:30pm on OpenTable. The place is obviously located in Caesar's Palace, next to the Nobu Hotel inside Caesar's. The place was amazingly decorated. I loved the atmosphere and the ambiance. It was dim, almost romantic kind of dining, which was perfect considering it was a double date for us. We requested to be seated in a booth, just because the table was larger and there was more room. Recommendation: book reservation in advance! We actually tried to go here the night before but there were no reservations available.  Our waitress/server was amazing. She was funny, interactive and had amazing recommendations. We got lychee sake, which was served delicately through an ice chambered teapot and wine glasses. $135 for the bottle.   Dishes:  Yellowtail with jalapeno- Delicious! Very soft and tasty, the jalapeno actually had a kick.  Salmon belly with a mustard sauce, capers and garlic chip- I actually like this. He didn't like the mustard sauce. The quality of the fish was amazing; however, the sauce was a bit overpowering for the fish.   Fois gras sushi- Keep in mind, one piece per person was $25. For four people, it was already at $100. Let me say, with that price point, we all expected more out of it. The fois gras lacked the soft, buttery texture and it was an extremely thin piece per person. You would probably get your money's worth ordering one order of fois gras at a steakhouse, as an appetizer. Just saying.   Shishito peppers- Pretty good. A few actually was spicy and had a great kick. Would recommend as a starter to set the tone.   Black cod miso- I think this deserves credit. It was good. I would have expected it to be softer, more buttery but maybe I had too high of expectations? They are known for this, but this dish kind of faded for me.   Spicy scallop handrolls- Like in my other reviews, I always want to try this everywhere. Was kind of disappointed. The \"spicy\" mayo portion was very light than what I normally like. Not worth it to me; however, he actually liked it when he usually doesn't.   Premium Sashimi Platter- We got two of this to split with each other. I think it was just the best option to try a little bit of everything without running the bill out like crazy. $90 per platter= $180. Comes with about 12 pieces each, cheaper than omakase. Out of this, everything was pretty decent. It did come with Otoro belly which was literally the melt in your mouth, deliciousness experience we were waiting for the whole night.  Dessert:   Fiji shaved ice- GOOD. Highly recommend. Was so flavorful and eye catching. Great way to eat the dinner on a light note.   Chocolate lava cake with match green tea ice cream- Also good. The lava was there.  Donuts with blueberry reduction and white chocolate inside- Also good.  I do think the fiji water shaved ice was the best and most appropriate dessert for the dinner.  Final notes. Let me start by saying, sashimi is NOT CHEAP. Our dinner combined with about $730 for four people. Notice the sake was already $135. I cannot read some of these negative reviews with price point issues and take them seriously on sushi places because good quality fish should not be cheap. Especially, here at Nobu, in the middle of Las Vegas, in the middle of Caesar's Palace. Let's be real okay, if you expect cheap, I suggest go off strip. If it is not in your budget, then look at the menu prices before hand and pre-plan. We decided the premium sashimi platter $90 for 12 pieces each with about 6 different types of fish, which was cheaper than omakase and ordering separately. Again, we did not come in here with the expectation that we would be completely full either. We went to Grimaldi's later that night for pizza. You are paying for the atmosphere, the location, the ambiance, quality and customer service.    Customer service was on point. We were seated with full view of the sushi bar with chefs actively working. I loved it, this was my experience. I would give it five stars if it were not for the slightly disappointing fois gras and spicy scallop handroll.",

From the beginning, the servers explain each dish and the experience thoroughly -- or even select for you based on your tastes/interests. I did some research and opted to select items I had seen widely reviewed. Every dish is brought out in a specific, strategic order and explained with such amazing detail.   We had the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, tuna tataki, lobster ceviche, black cod miso (amazing!!!), wagyu gyoza, Rock shrimp tempura, and the vanilla miso tart. It is so hard to pick a favorite because everything is so fresh and rich with flavor. It is worth every penny and I will definitely come back.",

    "text": "I was finally able to try Nobu. For some reason, Nobu always seemed like this fantasy restaurant where I would never be able to dine. Even after many trips to Vegas, I always figured it would be way to expensive. Funny thing is that I never bothered to look at the menu when I was making those assumptions. In the end, It wasn't really much different in price from many of the other fine dining restaurants, in Vegas. I did go in with very high expectations, however. As great as the food was, I don't think it quite matched those expectations.   As we walked in, the hosts didn't really acknowledge us until we got their attention. They also didn't say \"thank you\" or \"goodnight\" as we left. That kind of left a sour taste. Not really what you would want your guests first and last impressions to be. The rest of the staff was very friendly, and professional. Our whole table ordered the Nobu Signature Omakase. This is several courses of Chef Nobu's signature dishes, served in the order he feels you should eat them. Rather than critique each dish, I will say that all of them were quite good. The Miso Black Cod, being my favorite. We were also curious about the Shaved Ice, so we tried it. It was refreshing, but not quite what I was expecting it to be. I have to admit, that the food didn't quite live up to what I had imagined. I guess I was hoping that my mind would be blown away. I freely admit that it could have been that my expectations were just way too high. It was still an enjoyable experience, and I'm very glad I tried it!",

    "text": "Warning: rant ahead! When we came here for our New Years Eve dinner, we expected the itty bitty portions and big big price tag, but we did not expect such terrible service. Normally bad service wouldn't bother me so much, but when 6 people spend $800 on dinner, it becomes a problem. I really wish I could remember the name of our waiter because he was the most rude waiter I've ever had in my life, which was especially disappointing as this was my first time going to a snazzy place like this. I let my guard down about money for the night, allowed myself to go to a nice fancy restaurant since you get what you pay for, right? Boy was I wrong. The waiter was very rushed and obviously did not want to be there; he spoke so quickly that I had trouble understanding him and I was the closest to him. Maybe it was because the music was so loud, or the \"Cheesecake Factory\" noise level another reviewer mentioned, which I totally agree with.  He explained that the plates are family style so you are supposed to share the dishes. No one at the table was interested in doing that, so we all told him that we wanted to just order for ourselves. When the food finally came out, two people hadn't gotten their meals after everyone else had finished. Apparently, their meals had been served on various plates among the table, already consumed. This probably happened because the bussers bring everything out and just set it on the table because of the sharing thing, so I get that, but they also never once put the right drink in front of the right person...? Applebees is more organized than this place.  Now for the food... it was ok. I lived in Japan for a while and, sure, the fish is fresher tasting here than at your average stateside sushi place but it wasn't THAT much better. My friends had some phenomenal dishes but they were tiny portions. I'm just pretty hung up on the fact that my boyfriend ordered average-tasting shrimp tempura that consisted of two little pieces of shrimp on a plain plate.... for $14.  Overall this was a very annoying experience and in my opinion a giant waste of money. If you've made it this far in my rant, I suggest going to a different fancy schmancy place.... or the food court right next door.",

Didn't know about Omakase, didn't know about prices, didn't know about attire, didn't know what I was getting myself into LOL.   Literally wanted Japanese food with my co-workers and stumbled here. This place is totally packed and you have to expect a wait. If I had been prepared for this place, I would've totally knew what to order but I was literally just stuck. Ordered the salmon roll, hamachi roll and toro hand roll.   I have to say, this changed my perspective about eating sushi..it was so simple and clean (what i mean is no extra sauces, nothing fried, no extra veggies). It made me appreciate every bite of the fish. I loved all the fish I ordered..the hamachi was nice because of the jalapeno added to it and I just love toro..so mouth drooling! And the sauce was to die for!! I won't forget the taste of it and I wish I could describe it, but I would totally fail.   To be honest, this type of restaurant is not really my style. I'm giving this four stars because the service was good and it changed the way I like to eat my sushi now (as weird as it sounds). I used to get rolls that had sooo much stuff on it, but now, I love getting more simplistic rolls. Would I come back here again? Maybe, if it was with the right person.",

    "text": "Compared to New York this location fails in every aspect... Our waiter definitely did not have his head in the game... We were seated without Menus and when we did seat down and our waiter arrived he only brought a drink menu.  It took 10 minutes for him to come back and get our drink order, than 15 my after that to receive our drinks.  I found the food menu had absolutely no descriptions on how the food was presented so I had no idea what even sounded good.. Their rolls were very basic and very expensive for what you get.  The food was just ok but it's definitely a tourist trap nowadays and they are more concerned with flipping the table than give quality service and food.  We were there for almost two hours and only had one round of drinks and 5 plates... We than waited 25 minutes to receive the bill after asking for it and for our waiter to process the bill.  We just wanted to leave the restaurant after 30 minutes because service was just that bad... it took way too long for drinks and food to be ordered.",

    "text": "The food was spectacular. Every single dish was amazing. I came here for a late dinner with my colleagues and we opted for the Omakase Nobu Signature menu because the waiter mentioned that our group would probably easily spend $125 per person anyway if we ordered a la carte.   The omakase menu is basically a tasting menu. I forget how many different dishes it consists of but it was a good amount to get us all full. My favorites that stood out the most was the black cod miso, shishito peppers, and the hamachi in yuzu sauce. Those three would have to be my top favorites out of the course but every single dish was amazing and there was no complaints whatsoever.  The only thing that would've probably made the experience better was if the food came out at a more timely manner. In the beginning, the food came out everytime we finished a plate and then there was a wait time of maybe 20-30 minutes until the next dish. Then it came out back to back for 2 dishes and we waited another 20 minutes for the last one. Because we didn't know how many courses were being served, we kept assuming that was it and nothing else was coming out. I think the wait time would have been okay if the server checked up on us and updating us on the status to let us know what we do have more dishes coming out and just explaining more of what the dishes were.  Would've been a 5 stars for me if the service was up to par with the quality of the food. Normally I don't like to eat at restaurants in Hotels, but Nobu did not disappoint. I highly recommend! It is pricey so I'd suggest going if you just won some money at the casino or to celebrate a special occasion. It's a real treat.",

It kind of looks outdated and confused. If you sit in a big round table for parties, they have curtains and you can close your area. It kind of looked tacky. I also wasn't a huge fan of seeing the kitchen as I was walking to the bathroom either. The awkward eye contact I had to make with the kitchen staff..... Beside the decoration and the layout of the restaurant, the food and the service was phenomenal. Our server was so friendly and I never had to ask for my water to be refilled which was a super plus!    You must try to Uni here because it's so fresh! Fresher than sushi I had in Japan. I hope to try the hot foods here next time I do visit! Also try the miso ice cream! I know it sounds little gross but it is so friggin delicious! My first Nobu experience was unforgettable!",

We came here on 1/2/16. The waiter was extremely condescending to us, and when he found out I was interested in ordering sushi instead of being served family style in courses (eating sushi would have lowered our bill considerably and he was constantly trying to upsell us on everything), he announced \"WE ARE NOT A SUSHI RESTAURANT!\".  Uhhhh...really?!  Because that's the main food I've heard about from your restaurant.   After discovering I was ordering sushi anyways, the waiter kept asking, \"do you even know what that is?\" each time I mentioned a sushi roll (uhhh, yes. I've eaten sushi more times than I can count). My friend just wanted to order a normal entree as well since neither of us were overly hungry and we had tickets to a show and didn't have time to eat a meal with several courses.   When he discovered we wouldn't be spending $300+ on dinner, our waiter showed obvious disgust and barely came back to check on our table. We had each ordered a cocktail and were not even asked if we would have liked a second cocktail.   The sushi I had was pretty good, but to be honest, I had better sushi other places while in Vegas. My friend had some kind of meat skewers, which he said were good, but were very tiny. Due to how mean our waiter was, he opted not to order extra and just got a  sandwich somewhere else afterwards, which was ridiculous after spending $120.   I was so excited about this place, but the illusion is now over. I won't be back. Nobu, please look into training your staff. The service we received for this level of restaurant was atrocious.",

My boyfriend and I have always wanted to try nobu everytime we were in Vegas but never got the chance. This week we were in Vegas and decided it would be the perfect time to try it.   Service: I really enjoyed the service here. We told our server it was our first time and she did a great good at explaining the menu. She kept it simple and really knew what she was talking about. She helped us named out some popular dishes but never forced anything on us. We decided to order a little bit of everything instead of the omakase. They also had helpers that were always constantly refilling our water and cleaning our table after every dish.  Decor: the decor inside was very modern. They kept it dark, which was a little bit too dark for me but I didn't mind it too much.   Food: The food here was absolutely amazing! Before we ate here my boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't think chefs were able to make sushi taste that different to charge the prices that they do. But as soon as we took a bite into the yellowtail jalapeno appetizer, it was delicious! The flavors were so well put together and had a great balance. I was in love with their new style scallops and salmon sashimi. Chef Nobu really nailed it. We also tried his signature Cod dish which was also amazing. I appreciate how they serve their cold food then Hot after, it really did make a big difference and we enjoyed our meal.  For two people we got to tried a little bit of everything and some of his best dishes. Our total was about $200, which I didn't think was that bad  for how amazing the food was. After dining here, it definitely changed my view on how to eat sushi. I would love to come back here again one day. Amazing job",

There was a really big variation in serving size for many dishes; some were maybe an ounce or two of food whereas others would have filled me up completely if I hadn't shared them with my date. There seemed to be a lack of thought as to the accompaniments. E.g. I ordered monkfish liver and received a very large serving, probably 4-5 oz. However, other than the tart sauce (which tasted rather overwhelming), there was nothing to cut the heavy fatty meal. I asked the server for rice crackers or bread, but they didn't have any. I barely finished it. The meal was decent, but I wouldn't be screaming off the rooftops about this place.",

If you come here expecting Japanese food, it is not the place for you then. Peruvian food is actually very similar to Asian fusion food, especially cold and hot small plates, and cold small plates are the beautiful Nobu creations you should really try!   The ambience was pretty casual and relaxing, got seated at a comfy booth, started off with Badoit sparkling water, lemon drop martini and cold sake. Loved the cold sake container, it kept sake cold the entire time. We decided to go for Omakase, $225 per person.   Omakase courses:  Yellowtail jalapeno, spicy tuna crispy rice, salmon carpaccio with white truffles, whole Branzino with white truffles and truffle oil, mackerel sushi spread.   I guess because we went for higher price range so they made us a lot of truffles. To be honest I am not a big fan of truffles, but they tasted very good still. The whole Branzino was very delicious, just a little small for $125, I had a bigger Branzino for only $50 at a French restaurant the previous night. The mackerel sushi spread was my favorite, a few different kinds of mackerel fish, so fresh and tasty! Guess next time we will ask them to make us sashimi or sushi only! The cold dishes were all so yummy, the presentations were very beautiful too. Chocolate vodka dessert drink was bomb, loved it. The housemade hot sauce was amazing too.  Service was very friendly and attentive, food came out very fast. It was a great dinner, food was so good, but somehow I don't think it was worth over $500 for the two of us. Just keep in mind, try to order hot & cold dishes in both apps & entrees, that's what Nobu restaurants are famous for.   I still want to try Nobu Malibu soon, heard the views are amazing, if we were to spend that much on a meal, I would like some views too!",

This was some of the freshest and best tasting seafood I have ever got anywhere. The black is miso was recommended and it was great taste but we also got the hibachi or teppen it was definately more then we wanted to spend but we were on the strip so that is expected.  Service was top notch and food was excellent   We will be back again",

They don't serve rice with anything, and you won't see anyJapanese people here.  Sushi average around $8 to $10, rolls $10 to $20, and the main courses $30-$50.",

    "text": "I've had dinner at nobu over the decades from the old location in Malibu to the new one by the water - over in West Hollywood at the old L'Orangerie La Cienega location, London, etc. etc. etc. I am a fan of Nobu and I have eaten at matsuhisa for decades.  The service at this location was shocking. We were treated rudely. We waited and waited for our waiter.  This location obviously is very touristy but that doesn't mean you can charge the earth serve up second rate Nobu quality food and then be treated like a criminal for saying something about it. We honestly felt ripped off and that is no way a customer should feel in a restaurant they know so well. The Famous yellowtail and jalapeno at $32 a pop was close to the original recipe but was not right on the mark as I believe it should be considering it is such a trademark dish. THIS was the only dish close to the mark. The sushi was close but not up to par the rest was a miserable miserable effort. The gentleman serving up the miso soup in plastic cups trying to explain how to drink or I should say eat the soup was absurd. Obviously sushi 101 here at the lackluster location at Caesars Palace.  Despite the fact that you have tourist customers unaware of the legacy of this cuisine does not mean that you can treat them like cattle and serve up half ass nonchalant non-caring attempts with severity of attitude to the extent of personal insult.  At these prices we customers honestly deserve better than that - we entered the establishment in a jovial mood and left completely stunned and angry. The tables on both sides of us who we struck up conversation with both agreed that what they were experiencing was totally unacceptable. As a matter-of-fact the table to our right we made friends with left their meal early to go eat somewhere else! It's not very often that I feel as though a meal should have been comped in other words we shouldn't have had to pay however... I will warn people not to go to this location and if they do they should expect to be ripped off. The waiter we had was probably the worst I have ever had in my life which says a lot considering I've been all over the world and have eaten at restaurants in all corners of this globe! You should never and I repeat you should never get into a verbal conflict with the customer / server especially one that felt as though it could become physical at any moment. UNACCEPTABLE.",

    "text": "My expectations of food quality and service from this high end restaurant were more stringent given its reputation and price level.  Service was great: our waitress, Amber, provided good explanations and recommendations.  What made this a good dining experience was the way the dishes were served at the right temperature and appropriately timed to allow us to savor.  Cold dishes: the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno @ $39 (for a party of 4) meant two very thin slices each.  They were overwhelmed by an overabundance of ponzu sauce making it difficult to appreciate the True freshness of the fish.  Three out of the four kinds of kelp salad (except the bland white variety) were tasty.  However, most were not completely cut creating a challenge and awkwardness in sharing the small portions.  Hot dishes: the black cod done 2 ways (miso and butter lettuce wrap) was both superb.  The shrimp & Maine lobster that came on a bedding of shiitake & oyster mushrooms in a slightly spicy lemon sauce was flavorful.  The sea bass tempura style turned out to be ball-size bites served in balsamic teriyaki sauce (oddly reminiscent of Palm Tree Inn lemon chicken) that hindered appreciation of the soft moist fish.  After watching ten sushi chefs hustling behind the counter we decided to check their output.  Our orders (bonito, tamago, yellowtail and mackerel) were not remarkable or extraordinary.  The Inception Pinot Noir and Dashe Zinfandel wines were both decent.",

I believe in a previous review, I raved about Nobu and it wasn't even Nobu's review.  If you don't know what Nobu is, please move on.  It is culinary heaven.  If you don't know by now you probably never will.   I have eaten at a Nobu 4 times now.   Twice in Vegas, and twice in Los Angeles.   Chef Nobu and Mr. Deniro have got this bad boy down!   I have eaten sushi in Japan and it didn't even taste like this.   So here's the deal, I took a bunch of co-workers here.  Telling them it will be the dining experience of their lifetime.  Some were skeptical.   When the waiter said, has anyone dined with us before and I'm the only one that raised my hand, he knew that I knew that he knew it was about to be on!    So I jokingly said, sir, please keep it under $500 a person.  He said, well if you have eaten here then you know I could make it $1,000 person easily and you will still be hungry wanting more!   I was like yeah, I know....for that smart comment, keep it under $250.  :)    And he did.  However we left and the bill was just shy of $2K for 5 people.   I don't even need to get into what we had.  It was an assortment of 6 different courses that included sashimi, sushi, wagu beef, and then a desert of shaved ice with a hidden treasure in the bottom.   I've eaten all around the world, as my profile says.  Literally.  If you want the BEST hands down experience one could ever have, then Nobu is your answer.  Bring your wallet....and make sure you have a second credit card on hand cause you might max out your first one!",

We did, and, wow, did he.  Troy was so excited about the food and the menu, and he brought that excitement to the table.  He was uber attentive, and the dishes he picked were exquisite.  A funny twist was that I told him I wanted the toro with oestra caviar,  and he told me that if I liked toro, I'd like the toro carpaccio dish more.  I took his word for it, and he started the personalized menu.  A few minutes later, we got the toro plate with the caviar.  I figured he decided to go with my original suggestion.  We started to indulge in it, and he came by and told us he was sorry, it was meant for another table.  So, he comped us the plate and still brought the carpaccio.  He most definitely did not have to do this as we had no idea what our \"menu\" consisted of, but he really wanted us to try the other dish.  That made all the difference in the world, and, by the way, the carpaccio was leaps and bounds better.   I could say so much more about the food, but it's almost a given at most of these celebrity chef establishments in Vegas.  It's almost always always fabulous food....it's staff like Troy that set them apart and keep us coming back for more.  See my pictures for a thorough rundown of the food we had.    Perfect night!!",

I literally had several dishes that could easily all be on my top favorite dishes in my life. The top being the first thing that I ate. The glorious Chilean Sea Bass! When you get it, you will look at it, then say WTF?! It's a salad with some fried tofu on top. Get that shit away. You would have made the biggest mistake of your life. This is such a succulent filling fish that has an out of this world taste that cannot be described other that sex on a fucking platter. They would just bring use sushi and sashimi. And literally no matter what they brought out was amazing. I thought I had already had the best sushi I could possibly have but I was wrong. They use spices that I have never had in my life and I love it. This has to be the next best thing next to having sushi in Japan. If Japan is better than this place I might not ever leave that country. As long as I could order this food in Japanese I could care less about anything else. After just typing that I realize it sounds like I'm a drug addict. I can easily see how this food is drug like. It is a completely euphoric experience. Yes, the decor is gorgeous and feels oh so luxurious but I could care less if this food came from a dumpster. IT IS THAT GOOD.   GO HERE BEFORE YOU DIE!!!! A FOODIES BUCKET LIST MUST!!  special notes: -excellent service -ok drinks",

    "text": "OH EM GEE!!  This was some pretty damn good sushi!!!  This is one of the best places to get sushi I have ever been to outside of Japan. The price for the quality and freshness of the fish combined with the originality and flavors of the dishes is more than worth it!  I ordered:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeno Black Cod Miso Salmon Sashimi and Blue Fin Toro Sashimi  Each and every dish we were served was not only beautiful but taste even better than it looked!  The Yellowtail with Jalapeno had just enough kick for you to feel the heat in your mouth without losing the flavor of the Yellowtail. This is an extremely important trick when working with such high quality fish!  The rock shrimp was fantastic! It was rich and creamy and comes on top of a salad that has a nice citrus flavor to cut through the richness of the cream sauce. extremely well balanced and exactly what I wanted from the dish.  The Black Cod Miso was also very good. This is one of my favorite dishes to order when I see it on a menu. Not many places have it and this one definitely ranks right up there in my top 1-2 spot. Only Irori in Marina Del Rey may have a slightly better dish. The two are extremely close though.  The Salmon sashimi was melt in your mouth good. Salmon is by far my favorite when there is no blue fin on the menu and the sashimi here is super fresh!  Last we finished with the Bluefin Toro!!!! At $20 a piece it's not cheap. However, if you love sushi you have to try it at least once. There is just no comparison to other types of fish. When you order it just bite the bullet and get at least two pieces per person. If you only order one you're just going to be asking your server for one more piece anyways then probably another one after that.  To top off the great food the service was fantastic. I don't remember our servers names but they were super friendly and helpful. The decor is beautiful and this is by far one of the nicest sushi places I have ever been to!  Be warned though. It's not cheap at all. Even if I hadn't ordered the Bluefin I would have easily spent over $200 between two people with a couple of drinks. As it was I spent closer to $400. I've been to well over 100 different sushi places in my life and If you really love good sushi you have to try this place at least once. It's well worth the money.",

    "text": "Im finally back from month long vacation and its been an interesting one especially in vegas. When they say crazy shit happens in vegas, its so True. Looking back at my pictures made me wanna share my story here. I ate here with some girlfriends for my birthday. The food and service was great, except for the bar. We waited there only a few minutes before seating down. We were creeped out by the bartender with pubic looking hair. His english was annoying probably because he was mexican. He would just stare, yeah you...CREEPER. But whatever our table was ready. After eating and drinking we forgot all about him. We asked for the check, but the server told us some guys paid for it, SUCKERS.Trick in vegas, go out with girls half naked. Guys are stupid and pay for everything. The interesting part of the night was the manager. I dont remember his name but he was a white guy. After dinner, we went to Omnia. This club is awesome. We must have stayed there all night. This must have been a vegas classic. Sometime during the night i ran into the manager from nobu. He seemed a little different from the restaurant. I was thinking because he was finally off work. He asked how was my partying going. I told him amazing and i love it here. We went to the table and he made me some drinks. I left to get my friends and came back. VEGAS!!! When i got to the table , i saw him sniff something. I told him so you like to \"party\" huh? He said its \"VEGAS BABY\" and asked if i wanted some. I said im ok because im a Christian...ha ha ha. This just made my night in vegas. I seen it all here. My friends loved the \"party\". LOL. I dont know what time we got back to our hotel, but  knew it was late. The sun was coming up. I cant wait to come back to vegas. This place is awesome. You experience lots of stuff like in the movies. Thanks for the great time.",

Everything was perfect and absolutely delightful. My wife is pregnant and her option is limited. But she absolutely enjoyed her meal.  A few must try dish however is Softshell crab and watermelon combo. I didn't even ordered this dish, the manager is nice enough to send us this complimentary awesome dish. Next worth mention item is the crispy rice. I mean, its rice deep fried with spicy tuna on top, what so great about it right???   The presentation!! They make it look like a nice delicious rice lollypop. They have great miso cod and OMG that pork belly appetizers just melt in your mouth.",

I can't get over that they charged us (a lot!) for water..   Service = blah.   For such a nice restaurant, we should have been treated with a bit more respect. It was really only our waiter that annoyed me-- all other staff were kind.  Basically, I felt as if he was talking down to us-- like we didn't know a thing about what we wanted to eat. I was particularly offended, since we eat sushi very regularly, AND he was a younger non-Asian guy who apparently couldn't be bothered to shave and be presentable that day.   He also kept pressuring us to order more expensive things. With kids at the table, we wanted to order shrimp + vegetable tempura-- but before we could finish the order, he goes on and on about the lobster tempura, cutting us off. But we order shrimp + vegetable anyway and he give us a dirty look like we're cheap.   -____________________________-  Overall, he just seemed like he didn't want to be there, and thought that he was above us. The other waiters were so nice.. We just HAD to be stuck with that guy. I don't care how much he knows about sushi-- he could have been a tuna fish himself for all I care, but customers should always be treated with kindness and respect. I get that people have bad days but for a restaurant this nice, it's pretty much unacceptable.  So, for that, and the water, I give you three stars Nobu.",

    "text": "Wow. This place was so good that my new hubs and I dined here not once but twice during our week long Vegas weddingmoon at Caesars Palace. The menu can be confusing, so as a first time diner you'll be well guided by your knowledgeable and kind server as we were both times. It is a tapas style Japanese restaurant but there are plenty of options if you'd prefer not to do all shared plates. Both times we got the rockshrimp tempura in the creamy <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsauce-SLAMMIN.com&s=24ddafccb092b88e8b7f8dde86300606414f88a72108643667c9897baaa366ce\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sauce-SLAMMIN.com</a> They have regular edamame or the more fun and tasty kind which is tossed in a slightly spicy curry sauce topped with crushed peanuts. Get the fun kind. The nobu style tacos are little bites of heaven which you will dream about. They are only a bite size taco-literally one bite-but they will change your tastebuds lives. We tried the raw tuna, lobster and crab ones. So fresh. So good. Uhhh so gooood. The black cod was another dish worth mentioning, cooked to perfection with a sweet glaze. Some tasty sushi rolls included the spicy tuna, and both yellowtail rolls, one with scallions another with jalepeno-little kick but yum!! While it is certainly not cheap here, it really wasn't unreasonably priced. Plus, you're inVegas, things are more expensive. Luckily at Nobu the splurge is well worth it. Kinda wish we could go just one more time but DE is super far away from Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Before I start my review, I must warn the reader that the one star rating is purely relative. The rating is not because the food was too expensive. Rather, I believe that a restaurant that charges this much deserves to be compared against the very best restaurants in the world that charge a similar premium. If I were to compare Nobu to other teppan yaki restaurants such as Benihana or Hamada it would easily receive 4 or 5 stars based on the ingredients used and quality of food alone (for the most part).  Originally my plan was to eat sushi and sashimi at Hyakumi, the other Japanese Restaurant at Caesars Palace at 8PM. However, I found out that Hyakumi is now closed for dinner so I went to the Diamond Lounge around 8:15 PM and talked to a receptionist who informed me of Nobu's grand opening. He apologized and said that there is no sushi at Nobu but he could reserve a teppan yaki table for 2 at 11:00 PM. When I walked into Nobu I was a little annoyed to see that there was indeed a sushi bar as well a non-teppan yaki seating. Although this does not (and should not) effect my rating for Nobu (because it is Caesars's fault), I feel like this little tidbit of information is necessary. It is certainly reasonable to think that I may have perhaps approached my experience at Nobu with a bit of negative bias. I personally believe that this is not the case. However, I still urge you to read on with caution.   I came into Nobu with pretty high expectations because the Nobu at the Hard Rock in Las Vegas was highly acclaimed and was even adorned with a Michelin Star once upon a time. I went into my meal intrigued as to how a teppan yaki restaurant could receive such high praise, and then I found out that there is no teppan yaki at the Nobu at Hard Rock (go figure). In any case, I sat at my teppan yaki table and had only two tasting choices available for order. There was no a la carte option. I ordered the $280 per person option and the other option was a bit cheaper (I think $190?...I don't remember for certain). Although the sake menu was limited, my taste for dry sake was well met at a very reasonable price ($25).   The tasting menu that I ordered offered a variety of different courses including Toro tartare, seared foie gras, Maine lobster tail, wagyu steak, and Jamon de Iberico fried rice.   First, the Toro tartare was certainly interesting. It was served in a wasabi based reduction and was essentially chopped up toro (fatty tuna) mixed with a variety of spices and topped with caviar. While good, I still have some reservations regarding this dish. To me, it is a bit pretentious to take toro, chop it up and add caviar on top with some fancy sauce. As they say at the tables, you don't mess with winners. Don't split 10s, don't double down on blackjack, and don't mess with toro. Toro by itself is one of the most delicious foods in the world.  Furthermore, the foie gras was overdone. Seared foie gras should undoubtedly melt in your mouth. This foie gras overwhelmingly tasted burnt with a bit of crunch After a couple of chews, the foie gras did ultimately melt. That said, I just could not muster up the courage to tell our table side chef to his face that he had royally messed up the foie gras. One of the weaknesses that teppan yaki opens itself up to is a potential for inconsistency. The lobster tail and the wagyu beef, however, were immaculate, and could not be cooked better. The wagyu beef, cooked medium rare, literally melts after one bite.   As for the Jamon Iberico fried rice, I can certainly say that I was disappointed. Jamon Iberico naturally comes cured and is sliced thin and wide. Jamon Iberico should also melt in your mouth because of its marbling. When put on a grill and chopped up, the Jamon turns a bit chewy. The grilled Jamon is still of superior quality when compared to regular ham and I get that the whole point of grilling the Jamon is to extract the fat in order to make the fried rice just that much more savory and delicious. However, the end result is a bit lacking and I am not sure if the added taste to the dish makes up for the compromised texture of the Jamon.  As I was eating the fried rice, I decided to order a traditional Japanese garnish, takuan, to accompany my dish. It took a while for it to be served (~10 mins) and when served the takuan was of surprisingly poor quality. At a good Japanese restaurant you expect to be served takuan that is either off white or dark yellow in color. This takuan was bright yellow and cut way too thick. The most troubling thing about this is that takuan is used in sushi. It's simply unacceptable for a restaurant that touts its high quality food to serve such poor quality takuan. I understand that Nobu just opened, however their menu was just a big miss. The only circumstances under which I would recommend Nobu for now is if you are craving Wagyu and you are willing to pony up $280 for you and your guest(s) plus alcohol. Otherwise, forget it.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of many Nobus around the country for years, and this one just doesn't measure up. Will never return - only the one in the Hard Rock for me in Vegas from now on. The biggest problem was the complete and utter gauging that was done to our group of 10. They saw \"expense account\" and decided to take us for every penny possible. Told us we could go only pre-fix and only have the most expensive items in insane quantities. We've had bigger groups at other Nobus (including Hard Rock) and never encountered anything like this. We wanted a few items that were not part of the set menu and were told we could only have them in addition. After five courses we were filling up and said we didn't want any more and were told that we couldn't eliminate anything - it was all pre-prepared. The sushi is pre-made?! I certainly hope not. At that point the sushi and dessert were still 3-4 courses away- yet we couldnt cancel any of it. The amount of food was disgusting and absurd, and didn't live up to previous Nobu experiences in taste or quality. Many of the people serving us had no idea what they were bringing, what was still coming etc.  It was likely over $500 per person and absolutely not worth it - over half was left uneaten, while they brought more and more food. It was absolutely ridiculous and very frustrating. What a horrible waste. They should be ashamed of themselves.  And it didn't taste as good as other Nobus on top of the outrageous service. Never again.",

With his great expertise he guided us to perfect dishes to order, explained the dishes well and gave background on each dish. He was attentive, but not overly attentive by not stopping by too much. He was always there to answer questions, get us drinks etc. I have never requested a server again before, but when I go back in January to Nobu I will request Chris, he is that good.

I had the black cod miso as an entree- it was really lovely but be prepared for the sweetness of the miso.  It threw me off a bit but it was really nice.  The tobanyaki beef was amazing.  We finished with some rolls and they were all fantastic.  I love this place- wish there was one in Denver!",

Part of what made this meal so great was a very knowledgable server that worked with us to navigate the menu and put together a perfect meal with 6 different courses.  Her reccomendations were spot on and her customer service was perfect. Had a great start to the meal with yellowtail with jalapeno.  Then the new style salmon sushi, it's barely seared and absolutely delicious, maybe the best course of the night.  Third was the rock shrimp, it's lightly fried and not at all greasy or heavy and the sauce was excellent.  The squid pasta is not pasta, but squid shaped like pasta.  This was the other contender for best course, loved the squid, the veggies and the sauce.  The black miso cod is excellent and the servers reccomendations to have near the end of the meal was perfect because it's a little sweet.  We finished with a couple of small bite size beef tacos after all that seafood.  Nobu is arguably overpriced but we had such a great experience l, I can't complain.",

Upon arrival, we were greeted by beautiful ladies who caught our attention which made me wonder is the food as good as the women here?  Our waiter was very kind and very informative.  I just wish we had one of the beautiful ladies as our waitress.  It was our first time there so we really didn't know what to get.  The waiter recommended getting Omakase which is like a 8 course meal.  The food was pretty good, the fish we had was amazing.  However, our tab alone on Fiji water was $80 lol.  I don't think they even offer tap water which is a scam.   Every time the waiter poured Fiji water into our cups, I was cringing in pain.  At one point our waiter spilled some Fiji water on the table which made me want to scoop up that precious water.  Overall, the Nobu experience was pretty good but was it worth $170 a person....I would have to say no.  I rather take the $170 and spend it playing more Blackjack or Spearmint Rhino.",

    "text": "The food here was absolutely amazing.  We came here on a Saturday evening without a reservation but we were able to snag a seat at the bar.  We started off with cocktails, I got the lychee martini and my boyfriend had the cucumber martini.  I think my martini was pretty average but his was delightful.  It had a hint of lychee in it as well and was really refreshing.    This was our first time here and we were not sure what to order, but our bartender was very helpful.  We started off with his first recommendation which was the Yellowtail with Jalapenos.  I was very hesitant at first because I dont like jalapenos unless they are pickled and on my nachos.  The combination of the yuzu sauce, jalapeno and cilantro on the fish was perfect.  The order came with 6 small pieces and my boyfriend and I were pretty sad that it was all gone.  Next we had the shrimps with spicy garlic.  Absolutely amazing, the shrimps were plump and huge and it came with mixed veggies.  I normally dont eat veggies but we cleaned up this dish.  I kept drowning my veggies in the sauce, it was super good and not too garlicky where our breaths were bad.  After this we got the new style salmon.  This normally comes in a filet but the bartender had it sliced into small pieces for us to share.  Again, very very good.  I even found the recipe online and am going to try to make it at home soon.  Finally, after all of this I was still hungry, so our bartender recommended the black cod miso.  They came out lettuce wrapped style.  Very tasteful and crunchy.  Service here was very good.  Out bartender kept checking up on us, he even gave us complimentary pineapple martinis and training chopsticks for me since he saw I was struggling.  It did get a little weird though, another guy behind the bar asked my boyfriend if he could grab him another drink.  I didnt think it would be a problem until a girl behind the bar gave him a dirty look and started \"telling\" our original bartender.  After the second guy gave us my boyfriends new drink, he started talking to us about craps.  I wish he didnt though because that girl was shooting him dirty looks for about 5 minutes.  Im pretty sure she was talking shit about him to the other guys behind the bar too.  Very weird and unprofessional.  -1 star for that.  I would totally come back here next time I am in town.  This was one expensive meal but totally worth it.  Next time, we wont come in wearing only t shirts and basketball shorts though.",

To sum it up: the food was excellent and over-priced - just as we expected and were ready for, but the emphasis should be on excellent because it truly was worth it. The service, however, was pretentious, inaccurate, but most of all - excruciatingly slow. Our server, a gentleman with an Italian name that I had to ask for because he offered no information to us outside of his overbearing spiels, simply did not care that much. I could throw out guesses as to why he was the way he was - most likely our group didn't seem like it would be particularly lucrative for him (we were all bartenders/servers so he assumed wrong) - but that is conjecture. Getting in our order was a painful 30 minute process. Getting a refill of our alcoholic beverages (a tap beer and a whiskey on the rocks) took 15-20 minutes (it was not busy). And in the end just getting our damn bill took a good 20 minutes. I might go back but I would make sure he is not my server. Also, dude, that whiskey isn't made from actual coffee - it's made in Coffey stills.",

We had also sat there for at least 20 minutes before they even brought the food menus. The menu is very complex, so it would have been nice to be able to review it from the moment we sat down. Once we did order, the food came pretty quickly and everything was delicious. Just a warning if you order any of the tacos off the cold dishes though, they are the smallest things I've ever seen. They were good, but the waiter was pushing family style and there was no way to share those unless you ordered 2 per person. The gyoza dumplings, black cod miso and rock shrimp were especially delicious. It was very pricy but it's Vegas so I wasn't surprised by that. There are so many amazing restaurants to go to in Vegas, I'm glad I came here for the experience, but will try some others next time.",

They cook it with ginger-soy sauce. So delicious! ($18)  Along with a glass of Merlot ($16) and a glass of Layer Cake ($15). Both great, a bit pricey but hey, it is Vegas.  Spinach Salad with crunchy miso ($17) and Shojin Tempura (mixed vegetables - $16) -WOW great flavor on both.  We enjoyed all of it, our waitress was attentive, polite and helpful.

We showed up to an empty restaurant but had a nice table for 8 in the middle of the establishment. Here is where our  experience went to shit... One name, we met Alexandra our server. Alexandra, an overzealous brunette, greeted our table and immediately showed her True agenda, attacking our wallets as quickly as possible. \"I recommend you have one person to order for the table or have one of Chef Nobu's highly trained culinary professionals order for you\". The menu is intentionally vague so you have no choice but to rely on the recommendations of Alexandra, who was highly trained in the art of stealing, I mean selling. Only one Chardonnay choice for by the glass and it was $19.  To summarize, server sucked, my two sushi rolls were average at best and I walked out with a $300 bill for only me and my smoking hot wife. I'm not a peevish person normally but I left annoyed, luckily I immediately left Nobu and saw the Britney show which salvaged the evening. Note: if you go to Nobu, have a good group because I still had a blast because of the fellowship with the group at the table. Alexandra was nice to take a picture of the group on the way out.

We arrived early for our reservation and chose to sit at the bar. There were three bartenders and only 4 people sitting at the bar so again not busy. One bartender was just standing behind then bar as if he were a bouncer. We have been here before and to other Nobu's and our experience this time was very disappointing.   We ordered our meal and we know things come out a different times but this was ridiculous.  We received our lobster tacos first and they were amazing. My husband then received his miso sea bass and beef skewers together. I order the rock shrimp but they did not shortly follow my husband's food. My husband finished his entire meal and I was still waiting. We could hear the bartenders talking about my shrimp but nothing was said to us. I finally asked if my meal was coming out and they said yes. I asked when because at that point my husband had been done with his meal for more than 10 minutes. \"It's coming.\"  No I'm sorry we forgot to place the order or I'm sorry there was a mix up in the kitchen. No apology for the delay.   Customer service needs to be stepped up. Amazing food does not make up for poor service especially at these prices. At any other restaurant I would not have paid for my meal.",

You really can't beat the quality of the food here. Sushi bar is also a great way to watch the chefs in action. Haven't had a bad meal here. Service has always been on point as well. It's definitely pricey but it's also Vegas! Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "you must be tripping if you think this restaurant deserves 4+ stars. how the hell can you justify $20+ for seared hamachi with jalapeno? It's the same damn dish served by 50%+ of the other japanese restaurants out there, except it's $10 more expensive!  The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!  I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.  The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice. But just know that you can very easily take a cab 10 min off the strip to any number of japanese restaurants that serve same or higher quality dishes at 1/3  ~ 1/2 of the cost.  I was browsing through a yelp review while i was there to see what to order, and i actually saw a reviewer sitting at the table next to us who gave the restaurant 5 stars. She was eating some maki rolls by nudging a roll with her chopsticks...onto a spoon, and then eating out of the spoon. Her bf is a lucky, lucky man....",

    "text": "So I have been to Nobu in a few different cities but haven't been in Vegas since this one opened. I'm not a big fan of Caesars but I was ready to stay here to stay at the Nobu hotel. Only problem was whether intentional or not the reservation agent on the phone pretty much talked me out of it. However, I still absolutely had to dine at the restaurant.   Love this place and the food is amazing at every location, no matter what you order but this one loses a star bc the bartender, although really nice was very aggressive about trying to get me to spend more money than I had hoped too.   First he mentions all these specials not on the menu and when I said I would try 1 he said it's either $80 or $120 depending on how I want it prepared. I guess I should be flattered that I looked so wealthy to him but it really was obnoxious.   After that anything I ordered or that he suggested I had to ask the price of and he still was dishonest with some house special roll that was supposed to be $30 something and on my check, which I didn't look at carefully until after I left I was charged $40 something.   He also made me a drink I didn't like bc he didn't want me to start with the drink I wanted too and charged me for the drink I didn't like or drink???  They were out of ingredients for 3 drinks I tried to order and basically for this level restaurant I was very disappointed with the service and selection.   I had to ask for a glass of water 3 times before getting it and for spending about $200, by myself I was not so impressed with the service I received. However I love Nobu so I'm sure I will be back anyway.",

My husband had the sangria which was good, but we liked the mule better. Our server was extremely knowledgeable and helped us navigate the somewhat overwhelming menu. We ended up letting our server choose our meal after telling him our likes/dislikes.   The first course was yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and cilantro. This was both of our favorite dish of the night - the flavor was incredible and the ingredients were so high quality. We then had an off-menu lobster salad with avocado. It was delicious. Third was a salmon sashimi with a sesame oil sauce - it was good, but I preferred the yellowtail sashimi because it had more acidity. We also had a plate of shishito peppers that were very flavorful and not too spicy.   We had tuna tacos, which were tiny but packed full of flavor! Our least favorite was the tempura shrimp. I didn't like it because it was too heavy and the sauce reminded me of mayonnaise. I should have told our server we don't love fried food. The final dish was a blackened cod, which was cooked and seasoned perfectly. I was stuffed by that point but it was one of my husband's favorites.  I can't wait to eat at Nobu again. Next time I'll definitely have the yellowtail sashimi and tuna tacos again!",

My first impression was not great however, as they lost my reservation, that is never good when you are starving and ready for a good meal. However, they did move quickly to rectify the situation and found us a decent table in the bar.   Now, I have been fortunate to partake of some amazing sushi from NY to LA, and for these prices, that is what I was expecting.  Unfortunately, they did not deliver. It was good, it just wasn't fantastic, and for these prices, fantastic is what I would expect.   The service was also just good. Little mistakes here and there that should not happen at a reastraunt of That caliber.   Overall, just not what I would expect when I'm shelling out close to $500 for myself and two friends. I'm afraid that in the end, Nobu just came off as pretentious.",

Mmh... My wife and I went here to celebrate our wedding anniversary and the waiter really took care of us. We gave him carte blanche to serve us what he loved the most, and we weren't disappointed in the slightest. It did take a little bit of time for the dishes to come out, but we have delicious beer and saki to tide us over during each intermission.   Without question there is a tuna dish with jalepeno peppers that is BEYOND amazing... food of the g-d's. Kings and Queens would fight over this dish, just wow.   Ambiance, service, food and drink... if I could afford it, I would go here every day. But that's just it... it's kind of a place where you're only going to go once a year or less, because it really will put a dent in your bank account.   Cheers!!",

The fish was very high quality. I had the $125 chef special omakase with 6 courses and everything tasted fine. But that's just it. It was ONLY fine and not mind blastingly delicious. It was merely satisfactory and I don't feel the cost was justified. For two of us, it was nearly a $400 dinner including two glasses of wine plus tip. So I expected to walk away like, \"Holy cow! That was more incredible than the Hulk!\" But instead it was more like, \"Ehhhhhh it was good but I wouldn't go again.\"   I don't mind spending money for an amazing and memorable meal. I truly am a person that lives to eat. But I've had omg-so-effing-good-must-serve-at-my-own-wedding food for less than $10 too. So for $400, I want exceptionally outstanding food. I understand you also pay for the service, ambience, quality, and even the name too but I just didn't buy into it all...   Maybe it's overrated. Maybe I'm being too critical. Maybe a little bit of both. But bottom line, Nobu is a no-go for me.",

Secondly, 38 dollars an ounce at Nobu with a minimum of two ounces is flat out highway robbery. I have absolutely zero issue paying for a dish where I believe the quality matches the price. The wagyu beef is just simply not that great. Also, it's dripping in this sauce that Nobu douses so many of their beautiful fish offerings with. I was really disappointed in the \"New Style Wagyu\" dish. Just don't get it. Trust me!  Other than that, some hits that I was pleasantly surprised with the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the toro collar. We also had the black cod miso which my guy deems the best fish we had in Vegas. We ordered sweet shrimp and uni since it's our standard way of seeing how legit or non-legit a place is. It turned out to be pretty decent, but we've had better. I don't know that I'll be visiting this place again, but it was a good experience, to say the least! Good, but not phenomenal....",

I will say this place isn't cheap perhaps somewhere else is a better choice if $$$-$$$$ per person is above your comfort zone. However, I was anticipating a highlight of my dining experience and prepared to do my part.  Ok having set my mindset.  My server was excellent with a vast knowledge of the menu and willing to spend the time so I could understand. The menu is huge. Don't go here for an old favorite from somewhere else. Let them take you on a culinary adventure you will never forget.  My recommendation is the chefs prix fixe menu this comes at three different levels.  I opted for the top level.  I believe there were 5 courses each having several different components. As they will be different for you I will not bore you with every item but say that each was amazing. There was Wagu, diver scallop, foie gras, fish selections I have never seen before and the best caviar legally available in this count, straight from Russia house.  And if that is not enough gold leaf on one item.  It was beautiful and each item completely explained as it was presented. If cheap fish is what you want I know a great Vietnamese place on Spring Mountain road that has the best whole flounder for cheap and deboned table side. If an experience is what you want then look no further in Las Vegas.",

We had lotus root salad, and it was like no other time we had anything with lotus root or stem! Delicately prepared and flavored, that each bite just 'pops' on your palate.  Yellow tail sashimi was spectacular. I am not a big sashimi eater, but this one was too good to pass. Soaked to the right taste, cut very fine. Seared salmon, Miso cod were great as entrees.

He interviewed us first on what kind of dinner we were hoping to experience, our favorite flavors, how willing we were to try something new etcetera. And after that the courses just kept coming. Not one of them where anything but a gourmet dream.

Arrived at 8:03pm for our 8pm reservation and were told the party before was taking awhile on desserts - poor seating planning in my mind. Then after 15 minutes, we asked the same hostess what's taking so long still and she said she would speak to her manager. Another 15 minutes passed and haven't seen her call or speak to a single manager.. she just stood at her counter picking up calls and looking at her computer screen. Others in my party of 5 got frustrated and asked again what was taking so long and she said she will ask her manager, again. Finally, we just found another hostess to ask. We decided to take the regular seating when we initially booked for teppanyaki. Even ordering a beer at the bar took my friend 15 minutes, which was a little ridiculous how slow and poor service is. After being seated we ordered appetizers and still tried to make our teppanyaki seating happen. Finally, we were approached by another worker saying the seats are opened for teppanyaki. We moved our seats and sat around a grill that had extra 5 seatings and the table next to us had another extra 5 seatings...which super disappointed us that we couldn't have been seated in these seats earlier. I would've given this spot 2 stars based on our first hour here, but the wonderful waitress and bus-person for our table were super friendly and accommodating. Our chef was also super friendly and welcoming. This reminds me lots of Benihana but the food tasted a bit better. We had a few appetizers, drinks, first 3 teppanyaki sets to share and dessert.  - Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno: too much sauce that covered the actual taste of the fish. Sauce was a little too salty for me. - Lobster & Tuna mini tacos: this was just a one-bite and it came with two of each so it wasn't enough for the group. I had some of the tuna and thought it was ok, the taco skins were too thick, would've been nicer thinner to not mask the original flavor of the fish. - Mixed seafood ceviche: this was yummy with so many options inside with a good amount of citrus so it doesn't overpower. - Whitefish on chips: forgot the name of this order since my coworker ordered it. The presentation was beautiful! But the orange sauce above my fish was too much yet again. - Lychee, Mango mocktail: delicious! Would totally order again. - Shishito pepper: always a yummy choice! - Edamame: always a good choice for starters too & perfect amount of sea salt on top. - Tuna tartare: literally one small spoon bite per person - wish portions were better for larger groups. - Salmon & Tuna sashimi with lettuce wrapped in daikon: not bad, fresh fish. - Black Cod Miso: This is what they're known for & it's definitely as good as people say. Definitely order this!  As for the rest of the meal, it was in the first 3 Teppanyaki sets. Portions were small, but we were left filled because of all the stuff we ordered. My favorite of all these dishes is the A5 Wagyu & steak - cooked to soft perfection & melts in your mouth! The sauces were also yummy, especially the truffle one :p For desserts, we ended with the chocolate lava cake that my boss loved, and I loved the green tea ice cream paired with it. The ice cream mochis were also delicious! Overall, hostess service sucked and it ruined a lot of the experience, but the waitress for our table was awesome, food was ok - small portions & a bit overpriced, but won't be returning.",

    "text": "Arriving in Vegas for the EDC weekend and being a \"foodie\" going to Nobu was a must. Having planned the trip about a year in advanced, we also made the reso for Nobu then was well. Without a reso I wouldn't even suggest trying to go especially a weekend as busy as EDC.   To be clear and honest I walked in with little to no expectations considering the name and brand have been around for so long. We opted for the Omakase for $125 per person which came up to about 161 after tax and tips.   When we got the first course we were left underwhelmed thinking the portions were going to be consistently this small. We were wrong. Having this mentality made the experience of dining here so much better as we thought we were going to be leave the restaurant hungry and wanting more.   The service given to our table was amazing as very single course was explained in detail and dishes were brought out to the speed of our table, nothing was ever rushed and or unexplained. Waters were never empty, and dirty dishes were always taken cared of.   The entire meal was about 8 courses and my entire party left full and satisfied, both big and petite eaters being in the group. If you have a chance to check out Nobu I suggest anyone to as although it is rated with $$$$ the value of defiantly there. This meal was probably one of the more memorable ones in the trip.   TL;DR IT WAS AMAZING WALKED IN WITH NO EXPECTATION WALKED OUT FULL AND WALLET SLIGHTLY FULLER THAN EXPECTED.",

I'm not sure if it was because we sat in the bar area and didn't have a reservation, or what, but the service was shockingly mediocre for a $300+ meal. We asked our waitress if we had ordered enough food, and her response was that we could always just order more. We asked her for a recommendation, and she couldn't give us one. The experience that she outlined when we sat down was not the one we received. We were told they offered a custom menu and would provide us recommendations for tastes and textures that would complement each other and our palate. But as previously stated ... when we asked for a recommendation we got nothing. Service was also slow, and the staff let dirty plates stack up on the table.   Great food. Underwhelming service for fine dining.",

We got the Nobu Signature Omakase, please note that the whole course would take around 2 hours or more. We were short on time, but they were also able to help us customize our meal to fit our time limit which I really appreciated! The fish was fresh and the quality was unbeatable. The Miso Marinated Black Cod was my favorite, it wasn't too sweet or salty, and the fish was cooked to perfection! The other highlight of the meal was the lobsters, the meat was fresh and seasoned so well.   Besides what they have on the menu, you can also customize your meal according to your preference, budget and time. All the servers here were so helpful and friendly!  I definitely need to come back to try more things!",

    "text": "Thanks to Nobu, I can't truly enjoy Japanese cuisine in my hometown anymore. I've been ruined and awakened at the same time.  As advocated by our very knowledgeable and professional waiter, we had more of an experience than a meal. The usual inquires were made about our tastes and any allergies, then the rest was in the restaurant's hands. I'm glad they took the wheel, and they did not disappoint.  We were served several courses, each topping the next, and as time progressed my friends and I were looking at each other wondering when we were going to hit the finish line. Needless to say I was quite stuffed at the end and so was everyone else.  The highlights of the night were:  -The Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno, with a nice salty, citrus, and spicy finish to it. I wish I had asked for a second plate of it. -Miso Cod: Dear Lord, I don't know how to explain it. If I ever get framed for murder and end up on death row, I'll chose this as my last meal. I can still taste that sweet and savory sauce with that flaked  fish meat. Even the skin of it was amazing. -Sushi Platter- Needs no explanation, the rice was at the perfect texture, the fish was oh-so fresh, and i didn't even need wasabi to add to it. I wanted to eat it in its pure form. Simply delightful.  The Mochi ice cream was a great finish, but I was too stuffed to try. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it though, and I trust their tastes. I finished my cocktail and had an espresso as a pick-me-up before starting my long night exploring the town.  Overall, I felt the food, service, and drinks were all on point. It was also moderately priced compared to the other restaurants we dined at, and given it's in Vegas, I don't expect anything to be cheap. We were content with our bill while being cognizant of the service and meal we received. I extremely look forward to eating here again when I return!",

I mean, this is even when you're expecting Nobu prices.   First, if you're looking for a sushi meal, this isn't the place. In fact, the waiter told us upfront that they're not known for their sushi-they're known for their hot and cold dishes. These dishes are all smallish portions for a hefty price tag. Everything was good, but not stellar. There was nothing particularly innovative or fresh about the dishes here. I felt it was kinda all very 2010? The best thing about the dishes is probably the presentation, which is important, but it won't carry the day alone. The decor is nice and the ambience is nice. But the food and pricing was just kinda ridiculous. It was so disappointing after having high expectations!",

Nobu is pretty well-known since so many celebrities love to wine-and-dine here, so I was super excited to have my Vegas experience, especially since we already enjoy going to the Malibu location!  Because this restaurant is SO popular, it's highly recommend to put in a reservation...My brother made reservations for a party of 6, 2 months ago.  After arriving 15 minutes late due to Strip traffic, the restaurant was understanding and still got us seated pretty quick. Our Suhricka was absolutely on point last night and for her customer service alone we want to give 5 stars, thanks girl!   Time to get to the main attraction, the grub. So the idea for this restaurant is to order multiple plates to share amongst the table, tapas style so by the time you leave your comfortably full without feeling too stuffed.  Everything that we ordered last night was ridiculously delicious. Things like yellow-tail, which I normally wouldn't eat, I tried and loved it!  Definitely stepped out of my comfort zone with a lot of the dishes, and I'm so glad I did! Please refer to my many pictures and feel free to hit me up on any further information about a specific dish. Like I said, everything we order was delicious to the starters, main entrees and to dessert, ALL AMAZING!   Book your next dinner here, you will not regret it!  Trust!",

We got the family style sampler here, and I have to say that every dish that we had was made to perfection. I do not have any complaints what so ever. The sampler is very filling as it includes about twelve dishes ranging from seafood to steak, and all packed with amazing flavors! You can tell a lot of care and consideration goes into creating these dishes, and that they only use the best and the freshest ingredients. If I were to describe the taste of Nobu with one word, it would be \"beautiful,\" like I've just devoured art.   The service here was great as well. The servers were nice, friendly and very attentive. I love how they describe each dish right before they place it on the table. I also like the decor. It looks like jellyfishes are floating on the ceiling, LOL, but it has very modern classy feel to it.   I'll have to admit, we did choose this place because of the lyrics to \"Jumpman\" by Drake and Future, LOL. \"Chicken wings and fries, we don't go on dates. NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU I just throwed a private dinner in LA!\" Glad af we did though.  Coming to Nobu definitely added to this Vegas trip being the best trip with friends of all tiiiiiime.

The sushi was super basic, just like a traditional sushi restaurant. The atmosphere was super chill and relaxing. A little up scale as for the dress attire i would recommend. The portions are pretty small- and the way they bring out the food is not all together (I had to request that). Typically they bring out hot first, then sushi, then deserts. Personally, i would not go back but it is a restaurant you want to experience!",

Boom. out. done. nothing will ever compare to this experience and yes I'm tipsy from the unfiltered chilled Nagori sake but really ya'll this is world class cuisine served with passion and not even a hint of pretentious.  This will be my new stick upon which others will now be measured.   I've been a fan of and have studied Nobu since my cheffing days. The Jalapeno Yellow tail sashimi drenched in Yuzu with cilantro and ginger is a culinary masterpiece.  The delicate balance of flavors that overwhelm on their own, together they synergistically meld to nothing short of excitement at every bite.   Take my word for it and leave your food phobias and anxiety's back at the casino and let the waitstaff guide you through this adventure.  Your pallet and other sensory organs will thank you.   The service was impeccable. Every staff interaction was pleasant and sincere with the utmost respect for even the most persnickety appetites while still upholding the creative nuances of the chef and culinary staff.   Yes,  I paid $150 for a 7 oz Wygu Ribeye with truffle butter and crispy onions which probably could have been stretched into a weeks worth of meals for a frugal family of 4. Instead it quenched my inner most thirst, for now, at least, the perfect combination  of food, flavor, and flair, engineered for the complete dining experience.   I've said enough.  Sorry if I spoiled the plot but you still get to write your own ending and a happy one I wish upon you.   TL/DR:  Best meal ever.",

    "text": "Mika, our bartender, was super friendly & helpful! Her recommendations were all delicious! We had a great time here last night while watching the Warriors and Blazers playoff game 3. The bar is self-seated with full menu, so we got lucky with 2 seats right in front of the TV.   We ordered the yellowtail with jalapeno, king crab legs with ponzu, toro with caviar, shrimp + lobster in spicy lemon, new style scallop sashimi, and the black cod miso.  We also had a Hennessy with coke and a margarita. For dessert, we had the Japanese whiskey cappuccino. The bill was $340. The servers made sure to inform us on how to optimize the taste of each dish. For example, we were told to make sure to eat one cilantro piece for each yellowtail slice. One wouldn't know to do that since the cilantro were piled together at the center of the dish. I really appreciated this aspect of Nobu service.   The crab legs were lightly covered with tempura batter, and they were tossed in a ponzu sauce with thin slices of onion shallots and jalapenos. The toro with caviar was placed in a small bowl of sauce. The sauce was too salty for me, so I had to drain out as much sauce as possible. Personally, I don't like caviar because it is too fishy for me. Thank goodness there was a baby peach you chew on after the dish to cleanse your palette and to rid of the fishy after-taste. The shrimp + lobster was great because the salad and the salad dressing was perfectly seasoned. The scallop was slightly seared and had a nice oily sauce topped with sesame. The black cod was buttery and very salty. The miso sauce was great, but it was also salty. I wish we had ordered rice or some kind of side to balance out the saltiness. Our dessert was delicious! The Japanese whiskey cappuccino was a coffee-based creme brulee which different layers of foam, creme, and cookies.   Overall, I really enjoyed my first time at Nobu. I would love to come back and try the omakase next time.",

The sushi tasted like something you could get from a grocery store. Like most restaurants on the strip they charge you for a bottle of Fiji water & while that's the norm I feel like it's should be standard at a high end restaurant. The highlights of the night were without a doubt the \"black miso cod\" & \"rock shrimp\". The drinks were amusing at best as I was served something with 24k gold but tasted like an acai bowl. I'm glad I got this out of my system because I believe they're building a hotel & restaurant in west loop in Chicago  & this visit in Vegas will save me time, effort & money because I definitely won't be in attendance. In closing this slightly above average food with celebrity endorsements",

The restaurant is very classy and has a great menu selection.  The staff service was okay.  I think because we didn't look like we were very rich, they didn't tend to us well.  Which sucks because I wanted to treated the same as the people around us.  We didn't end up ordering much as we were getting discouraged, but here is what was on the menu:  Miso soup: this was very good which I was happy with.  Compared to the other sushi place I went to its was perfect.  The tofu had the perfect texture  White fish sashimi: this was also very good and fresh  Spicy tuna roll: same, fresh,  tight sushi roll.  It is my husbands favorite sushi.  Chilean sea bass in a miso sauce:  this was a disappointment.  First of all they said it was coming then they said it was delayed for some reason but they served the people next to us.  When it came, the sauce was good but it was overcooked.  This was to be the highlight of my dinner and it was just bad.    If service had been better and they paid better attention I would have given it a 4 star.  The sea bass was a big thing since it is supposed to be the filet mignon of all fish.",

This is probably one of the best sushi restaurants in Vegas but be aware it is always packed so prepare to wait, especially if you plan to dine during normal dinner hours. It is even difficult to get a reservation unless you make one several days in advance. The prices are quite high, even compared to other Nobu restaurants but the quality is arguably also a little higher as well.",

Fish was okay fresh, nothing very exciting. However we also ordered the hot served Miso Black Cod, it was fatty and very good   Staff was okay attentive.

The delay appeared to be related more to their disorganization than demand or to orchestrate the allure of the restaurant.  I actually witnessed a hostess advise an older patron that she would need to leave her walker at the front door due to space.  Hmmm...how many different levels of dumb does that bring to mind?  The wait staff was good but we did not have the consistency of 1 server.  That offered confusion and delays at times.  They were all knowledgeable and helpful.  The food was good but not worth all the effort to get to Caesars.  This was not the experience I expected from Nobu or had at other Nobu restaurants.  I would not recommend or go again when in Vegas.",

We ordered a little bit of everything, as is the Nobu method, but the stand-outs were the peppers, many variations of edamame, sashimi and sea bass. AND, the black cod was TO DIE FOR. I could eat the black cod everyday, for the rest of my life, and be very, very happy. Order it!!  The staff was incredibly knowledgable and helpful, and when my wine refill was clearly not right, they corrected it in 5 seconds.

This was convenient and a great change of pace from the rest of our Vegas trip. This dining experience was fantastic; it was like an oasis in chaos. We had a group of 7 (I think a really great size for this dining experience is 5-7) and did the multi course omakase with the chef's daily creation menu. Everything was absolutely phenomenal. One of our party has dietary restrictions and the waiter was great about understanding just what those limitations were so the party member didn't miss out on any part of the experience. The dishes that stood out the most: the seabass, the lobster, and the yellow tail tuna. OMGosh!  I strongly recommend letting your server and the chef handle selections. Anytime we diverted from the recommendations, it really wasn't as good (definitely not bad, but just not blown away good like the rest of it).  Everything was impeccable and bursting with flavor. So delicious!!!  The waiter kept all the drinks flowing, was super attentive, and we never had to wait long for the next course. I highly recommend checking out this place!  Just give yourself enough time to truly enjoy the experience.  This is the perfect dining oasis in the chaos that is Vegas.",

The customer service was amazing, I've never had a more attentive waiter. He asked us for our timing and if we had any plans after dinner to make sure that we would not be late to our next venture. He explained the menu to us in detail and since it was our first time, we let him decide the menu for us. He asked if we had any allergies and if there was anything we didn't eat. I've never been a fan of raw fish just because I don't like the idea of eating raw meat. He was very convincing and assured me that I would change my mind about raw fish after trying their yellow tail. HE WAS RIGHT! After trying the yellow tail (our first dish) I thought it was delicious! The dishes came one at a time to make sure we tasted the full flavors of that dish. The dishes were worth every penny. We couldn't decide on a particular dessert so our waiter brought us a variety plate of what we wanted. We go to Las Vegas at least once a year, after our experience at Nobu, we will be making this a MUST annual visit :)",

    "text": "We had the best meal of our Vegas trip at Nobu.  Our server suggested the tasting menu and put together an amazing dining experience based on our budget.  He didn't up-sell or condescend, instead he put together a great menu that we all loved and we could tell he loved serving us and explaining the dishes.  I almost wish we'd given up our steakhouse night (CUT was good though) so we  could have moved up a price step or two at Nobu... it would have been well worth it! Overall, Nobu is highly recommended and was the surprise show stopper for us during our time in Vegas!",

    "text": "Yum!!! My friend and I shared the Black Cod Miso and the Shrimp and Lobster with spicy lemon. Both of these dishes were amazing but I especially loved the lemon sauce from the shrimp and lobster dish. So delicious! The cod was of course tender, and melted in your mouth with amazing flavors, but the lemon sauce stole the show!! For dessert we shared the bento box which included a delicious decadent chocolate lava type cake and home made green tea ice cream. We also shared a banana dessert that was very good. Warm bananas in a spring roll with pralines and praline ice cream. I loved the way the restaurant was decorated, it reminded me of a restaurant in NY. Which makes me very excited thinking about what the hotel rooms will look like! This was a great experience all around. Amazing food, friendly and knowledgeable staff and beautiful atmosphere made my visit to Nobu the highlight of my vegas trip this past weekend!",

We ordered the tasting menu, telling our server we were comfortable with approximately $200/pp, when asked. Expecting the sake pairing and food to be imperiled for what we were paying (approximately $500 for our meal). Being self proclaimed foodies, we researched this restaurant, among others, and decided it would be the one. We left after our second course, extremely deflated. Our sake and food was served with such a disconnect, we could not even enjoy it. Food was served without a sake pairing, 10 minutes later sake arrived, with no explanation. Horrible service and experience. We spoke to management, who profusely apologized and offered his card, but then expected us to pay $100 towards our meal. It was horribly insulting. We will never be back. We have dined at many 5 star Vegas restaurants, and expected the best service and quality from this as well. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "I took my best friend here for a late birthday celebration, last Tuesday.  With both of us being \"foodies\" (in the sense that we actually work in the food industry and have high standards in regards to service as well as the food itself...not those self-proclaimed foodies that have too much money to spend and no sense of what good food really is...), we had high expectations for a place that was undoubtedly going to cost $200, at least, for our experience. I say experience because that's what dining out at a place like this should be, not just \"a meal someplace\".   Anyway, our reservation was at 5:00 on the dot.  We arrived just a few minutes before and was told by the hostess (who was my least favorite part of this whole experience and initially put a bitter taste in my mouth, questioning if I'd made the right choice to dine here) we'd have to \"wait 10 minutes\", even though we were the first to arrive.  She wasn't my idea of friendly and in my opinion, a weak asset to the restaurant.   Never mind her, though. We were seated just after 5pm (and after several couples who arrived after us) and shortly after Troy, our server, greeted us and took our drink orders.  While our drinks were being made, we were overwhelmed by all of our food options.  Troy returned, asking if we'd like to start with some cold dishes or if we'd like for the chef to send out some of his favorite dishes (perhaps this isn't an option all guests have, but it was one we had, so we went with it - and no, it wasn't the chef's tasting menu that is available on the menu). Our drinks were brought to us by the bartender himself who was quite friendly, chatting with us about my friend's unique choice of beverage (Jameson and cranberry). Troy brought out our first course (of NINE!), which was a yellow tail sashimi dish.  Oh. My. God. AMAZING!! In fact, EVERY dish we had was absolutely incredible. Our dishes started cold and ended hot, just as it should be.  The time in between each course was perfect and just long enough for us to chat and digest and mentally prepare for our next foodgasmic dish. 8 amazing savory dishes later, we were presented with a special dessert plate, which was equally as delicious as the rest of the meal.   If you enjoy truly great food, a beautiful atmosphere, and friendly service (excluding the hostess), I highly recommend Nobu.",

    "text": "Nobu is very good. But...as others have said, it is pricey and it adds up quickly if you're not careful. My husband and I tried the Nobu style tacos (chicken and vegetable respectively), I got the vegetable skewers (kushiyaki) and the tofu toban-yaki, and my husband got the free range chicken dish with the spicy sauce (can't recall what it was called). He tried a midrange sake recommended by our waiter, and I got a glass of the plum wine. I was 100% happy with everything I ordered, except the skewers. They were 50% onion. (I don't know about you, but I don't eat big hunks of onion on their own.) That being said....the eggplant was delicious and the Peruvian corn on the side was very good. The tofu toban-yaki was amazing! Delicious broth and plenty of tofu to fill me up. We were too full to try some sushi or dessert afterward. I'd probably go back, but maybe with a big group and be more willing to really splurge on a variety of things. Just a tip--they tell you that they serve food in a certain style so that you can try everything together, but that doesn't work if you eat different foods as we do. In hindsight I would have asked them to bring food out together in courses. And a warning--I'm sure it's great fun to let them design a menu for you, but it's also probably VERY expensive! :)",

    "text": "I have heard about Nobu and knew it's expensive but wanted to try it.  My husband and I went there on Thurs eve.  They could only take us at 10pm.  It's really not worth spending the money.  Since it's our first time there, our waiter suggested a couple of cold dishes, then a couple of warm ones.  We had snapper ($34 for six very thin slices in a sour sauce) and yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno ($24). The fish was fresh, but not that special.  We also had the uni shooter ($16) and oyster shooter ($12).  They are both pretty good. My husband liked the oyster more.  For hot dishes, we had their famous black cod with miso ($30). We didn't really like it, the sauce was too sweet for us. Then we had the scallops with wasabi pepper ($36). The scallops were too dry and really spicy. We couldn't eat it so the waiter offered to take it back. The waiter asked if we like tempura. We said we like it ok. He suggested king crab tempura. As usual it's a tiny dish (about six small bite size pieces). We later saw it $48 on the bill. It was good but again very expensive.  Since the plates were so small, we ordered one more hot plate. It's the tobanyaki beef. It was good and the beef was tender. I think we liked this the best. It was ($44).  So overall, our experience was quite disappointing. We didn't mind paying $$$$ since we knew that it's a pricey place. But the food and the service were not a good experience.  If you really want to give it a try, purchase a groupon. We didn't think of checking groupon before going there. I later saw it available. You get $150 value for $95.",

    "text": "The menu offers interesting unique dishes.  I was almost going to try the truffle tasting but after the disappointing white truffle dobin mushi I am SOOOOOO glad that I didn't splurge on the $400 tasting menu.  We tried several pieces of sushi we had not heard of before and they were tender but not much flavor.  The black cod miso was delicious but the kitchen needs to do a better job at removing the bones - way too many left in - chef Nobu would be ashamed.  The sea bass with dry miso was just as delicious as the black cod.  The service was ok, but way below what I would have expected from a restaurant of this caliber.  The reception desk was well staffed but two of the three girls were clueless. the waitress was pleasant enough but didn't seem to be concerned at all about the amount of bones in the cod and I'm sure did not bring it to the kitchens attention.  the manager/assistant manager Annie should be fired - when an issue was brought to her attention she seemed receptive but all she did was hang out on at the sushi bar and never came back to follow up with us - a bigger slap was when she was straightening up chairs at the table across from us she deliberately avoided us and ran back to the sushi bar.  This is the second time I've eaten here and would not go back.  There are TOO MANY other options in Vegas with fabulous food and better management & staff.  No reason to waste your time and money on this restaurant.   However, I would absolutely stay in the hotel again - so many nice touches - almost felt as good as a Four Season's.",

Our waitress was awesome - she was great at guiding us to the best dishes with the best balance. We ended up ordering everything ala carte, although there are lots of options of how you can order or price your meal.   We ordered the Blue Fin Toro Tartar and the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno from the cold dish menu - all were nicely seasoned and accompanied by various things.  We also had the Salmon New Style Sashimi, which I loved - it was probably one of my favorite dishes.  The Hamachi Kama from the Brick Oven Dishes section was the best that I've had - even their ponzu with their daikon was great.  From the same section we also tried the Baby Vegetables for our veggie intake, and I loved the grilled flavor that the veggies had.  From the Nobu Hot Dishes section, we ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and Akadashi Soup.  Another one of my favorite dishes was the Pork Belly Miso skewer from the Kushiyaki menu - the flavors and texture were well done!  Overall all the dishes were very well seasoned and well cooked.    All four in my party were very happy with our meal, and we were already talking about returning to Nobu on our next trip to Las Vegas!",

    "text": "A delightful dining experience, with courses presented beautifully. The service knew it was my birthday and they were very gracious about it. We opted for the omakase, which gave us a great surprise for each course. However, in retrospect, I think it would have been better to just pick and choose to our hearts content because there were several courses that were complete misses for us.   The standouts were: the sashimi and sushi courses (2nd and 4th courses). The rice was really what made the 2nd course so special for me. A little nit picky, but wished the tamagoyaki wasn't so grey in color. The sweet shrimp and fried shrimp head was probably my favorite thing.   The not-so-good: the dessert course. I love dessert and to me, the birthday celebration revels in a wonderful dessert. Sadly, the dessert here, fried ice cream with spicy chocolate, candied fruit, and caramel sugar work tuille failed to deliver. The candied fruit was not properly candied and soggy and extremely chewy/hard to eat. The caramel sugar art was not very delicate and could take a tooth out. The fried ice cream itself was fine, but nothing really special. The presentation was special, but the taste failed to deliver.   SX was still hungry after this dinner and we ended up going to In and Out afterwards :(   Definitely worth a visit to any of the Nobu restaurants for a special celebratory dinner.",

We basically just ordered everything that looked good, and I pretty much liked everything with the exception of the tacos-too small for the price, you are better off ordering something else. Also, wasn't a big fan of the new style salmon sashimi, the sauce was kinda off to us. The black miso cod was not our favorite.  On to the things I loved...I loved the soft shell crab and watermelon appetizer (not on the menu). The jalapeno yellowtail appetizer was also good. We were surprised at how delicious the chicken entree was, the meat was juicy and it was served with three delicious sauces. We loved the trout which was served with crispy, delicious spinach. The sea bass was also great! The cooked entree dishes-chicken, sea bass and trout were pretty large orders, bigger than we had expected. I also liked all the handrolls, which were decently priced.   The prices weren't as crazy as we had anticipated for the quality of food and ambience. Definitely want to try different locations of Nobu on special occasions!",

Without reservations we were able to sit near the bar area at one of the circle tables which was very cozy.  Between 6 of us we shared the Figi shaved ice and whiskey cappuccino. I liked the show and explanation of our server who poured various ingredients on top of our figi shaved ice. But $22 for shaved ice? No thanks. It wasn't that spectacular enough to spend that much on this dessert. The cappuccino on the other hand was fantastic. It's small so I wouldn't recommend sharing with that many people. The coffee grounds in the dessert added a nice crunch and the overall taste of this gave me a jolt of energy for the night. It also came with this tiny square fruit filled chocolate.",

After all, it is SUPPOSED to be a fusiony Asian cuisine / Japanesey kind of place.   I suppose for that, they're okay, but they're not so creative that it blows my mind, although it certainly blew my wallet.   I didn't feel great value eating here, I didn't feel like they had fantastic service, or were amazingly impressionable. Or personable. Or anything really. I just felt like I went to an expensive restaurant to eat a meal. This is actually a far cry from my experiences elsewhere on the strip. Yes money is the reigning king in Vegas, but it doesn't mean you can get away with just anything if you have a name.  I would pretty much pass, because it's kind of just a fancy, to be seen place. Not really great for food, drinks, or if you want to have a good time.",

We went this past weekend on a Saturday night for my dad's birthday celebration in Vegas (it was 6 of us at a prime time, so keep in mind that I made the reservation about a month prior to it on OpenTable). The drinks were great, we ordered a variety of specials like this one that literally tasted like Christmas and fall, to this Lychee Martini, which was definitely a favorite among the crowd. You have the option to have the waiter order all of the courses for you rather than picking from the menu, which is exactly what we did. It worked out great since everything is family-style, plus we had half & half meat eaters vs. seafood lovers, so the balance of options and courses were perfect. Our waitress Amber was amazing. Her choices were spot on when we told her what we liked/didn't like. We were probably at the restaurant for 2 hours but took our time with everything. It's definitely extremely expensive, but 10000% worth it especially for my dad's 60th birthday. What a place.",

All the food came to our table at different time and I dislike how our waiter was trying to convince us to split our order among us 10 people. Like, really? I want to order myself a $55 steak and enjoy it by myself but the waiter keeps insisting that we share. He wanted me to eat one slice and give away the rest? No thank you. I want to enjoy my plate by myself since the portions are pretty small. One of my friend ordered a hand roll sushi and he was the last person to get his plate. I do appreciate that the manager came by to apologize but I think the cooks/chefs need to learn to balance out cooking table meals and getting everyone's order done about the same time. Also, a funny comment that the waiter made was Nobu is not known for their sushi. Like what? I thought this place is about their seafood?",

We dined here on Sunday, 11/12 to celebrate our friend's birthday. Everything started out as expected, our servers were pleasant, cocktails were tasty and we were ready to throw down on some amazing eats. I'll add a few notes about what worked well first. The tuna appetizer was probably my fave over the yellowtail w/ jalapeno appetizer. The king crab kohlrabi salad was soooo good, we ordered it again. The black cod miso, which they're known for, didn't disappoint. It was so tasty with the glaze. We tried both of the Chilean sea bass entrees and the one with the black bean sauce was the winner. Having dined out with this group on several occasions, we always get an oyster or uni shooter. It's actually one thing I look forward to. We opted for a round of uni shooters. Whoah. It was like taking a shot of straight soy sauce, no uni taste whatsoever. And, it wasn't one person in our group, everybody had the same reaction. We brought it to our server's attention. The staff could have handled this better. It went from, the shooter is supposed to taste that way, to we will comp you the birthday dessert, to we can take 1/2 of the shooters off your bill to finally taking all of the shooters off our bill. Needless to say, we were all very surprised by the way Nobu handled this situation. 2 stars for poor customer service.",

    "text": "This restaurant is definitely worth it for the experience. The ambience is intimate with dim lighting. The first thing the server asked us was if it was our first time as this is probably on a lot of people bucket list of restaurants to try.  Lastly, if you are hoping to eat before drinking to soak up the alcohol later in the night, this is not the place to waste your money on, unless that's your style. They recommend you to try 3 of the cold appetizers and 3-4 of the hot appetizers before you order sushi, because you do not want to fill-up on rice in the beginning.  The server explained the menu to us and gave us suggestions on recommendations for first-timers. The miso cod was one that we tried, and I would highly recommend all first-timers to try as well. We started off with the yellowtail carpaccio with ponzu sauce, and it was delicious, coming from someone who doesn't eat raw fish. For something fried, we got the wagyu beef and lobster tacos, which were enveloped in fried wontons, not taco shells lol. They were a one-bite type of app. I tried to share it with my boyfriend, but it always ended up on the table, oops. Can't take me anywhere fancy~   Next we got the trio of oyster which had a different sauce to each of them. Forgot what it was called, but it was pretty good, we followed that with shrimp tempura which kind of looked like honey walnut prawns, but didn't taste like it. It was bombbb diggity.   To finish off, we ordered 2 rolls, a spider roll and another roll I forgot, both were really good. They use daikon to wrap the rolls over the seaweed, which is different, but I enjoyed it.  Bill came out to around $100 per person.",

From the oversize light fixtures inspired by Japanese tea whisks to the columns of bamboo, the design of the restaurant transports you to another world. The service is attentive as you would expect at a high end sushi restaurant.  We did the chef tasting menu. Each course was brought out like it was an act in a theatrical production. The plating was masterful. Some of the standouts include the sushi, sashimi and black cod. The sushi and sashimi were fresh a beautifully crafted. The black cod miso that is marinated and broiled melts in your mouth. Make sure you leave room for dessert.  If you are a sushi lover, you cannot go wrong with Nobu. It is pricey, but you are paying for an experience - not just a meal.",

Empty glasses, sauces that never came out with the dish, bathroom out of order, being served incorrect drinks which were still on our tab but the waiter could never be found to tell him about it. No sight of a manager either. We asked for him to just bring out dishes and I personally believe he just rang up the most expensive items. I was disappointed he never asked about likes/dislikes or allergies. Everything was lobster and salmon - absolutely no variety. One sashimi dish and no sushi. 3 dozen oysters (overkill) and it was so salty we had to send it back. Chef agreed it was salty and tried to fix it with lemon. Drinks and ingredient quality were the only redeeming part of the meal. Bit of a let down considering the reputation and price. I wouldn't visit this location again.",

Everything was so harmonious.  Do it. You won't be sorry.  Menu: Yellowtail with yuzu sauce, salmon belly with miso, oysters on the half shell and big eye tuna with caviar, uni shooter, the most melt in your mouth wagyu that I've ever had, black cod with miso glaze,  king crab tempura, a selection of the freshest sushi, with tuna, whitefish, and salmon belly with yuzu soy, hamachi tempura with jalapeno sauce, and a coffee mousse with whiskey vanilla foam.   Absolutely incredible. My complements to the chef and the staff. A singularly amazing culinary experience.",

So, wonderful service all evening and my partner decided to order an crazy expensive Sake along with lobster, some sushi, some additional things on top of the $200+ multi course extravaganza. I mean way too much food, so much excess but was it great. Then the chef came out, hell of a cook and a decent stand up comedian as well. Now, with say 10 people sitting in front of the chef, our fellow diners were pure bores and who really wanted to share an amazing meal with a bunch of no-names from fly over states. Anyway, the  lobster amazing, the Uni crazy good and the True Japanese Kobe was so much better than USA Kobe and it blew me away.  What a meal, check over $1,000 (You do not need to spend that and either did my partner as he was comped)(gambles way too much). Yes, way to much but I accept gifts!",

    "text": "\"Nobu Nobu Nobu.\" I was told by a few people that the Omakase chef signature dish for $125 is the best way to experience Japanese cuisine. So I jumped on it! The food was so good that the chef prepared it to where you don't have to dip it in any additional sauces. You clean your palette with the giant pickled ginger sticks! I'm used to the thinly slices slivers, but these chunks are my new favorite.  I was truly impressed with the servers who were able to explain each dish they served without stuttering or adding \"uhm.\" They were very confident and knowledgeable of the dish served! The chef carefully placed each ingredient on the plate making it look like art!   So you may ask \"why 4 stars?\"  For a high end restaurant with 4 dollar signs, I didn't expect my chopsticks to be the wood ones where you have to manually break off yourself and hope it actually splits in half. I would suggest keeping the disposable chopsticks, but ones that are already separated. Also, the food was a bit salty. I went through several glasses of water and that could just be that I'm dehydrated from the Vegas heat. Who knows. I would recommend anyone coming here for their first time to try to sampler!   Unfortunately I don't remember all the cool names and all the fish that I ate but I'll try my best to describe them in my photos attached!",

    "text": "Simply put this was an unreal meal. The price is  steep but it is Vegas and it is Nobu and for this quality food it was worth every penny. The \"recommended dishes\" we got from our waiter were all the most expensive dishes which was a bit disheartening but I cannot complain about the meal.   Yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno is 100% the best appetizer, hot or cold, on the menu. We love sashimi appetizers so we got sake (salmon not the drink) and fluke. All 3 were excellent but I suggest you diversify your appetizers as we surely started to feel overwhelmed by all the sashimi (in the best way possible)  The scallops in a spicy garlic sauce was an amazing hot appetizer option. Every bite was flavorful and cooked to perfection. You get a good amount of scallops too!   The sushi was typical Nobu, top of the line, sushi. Not too much to say here except order some. The wagyu was out of this world. For $20+ a piece I would suggest only getting one because that's a very steep price but absolutely worth it. They also offer wagyu filets as well for another steep $40 / oz.   I love Nobu and this location. If you are in the market for very quality food and have a budget to spend then this is your place. Make a reservation as soon as you can because the atmosphere is busy and every table is booked.",

    "text": "Nobu rocks. This is a Michelin starred restaurant serving Japanese cuisine in the middle of the Las Vegas Strip. Located in the Nobu Hotel section of the Caesars Palace Resort, this restaurant is high class and haute cuisine worthy of a full rating.  Please do not expect this to be a sushi bar. This is an insult to the chefs who include sushi as part of an amazing experience. This is advanced food with impressive and unique interpretations of Japanese cuisine. The wonderful staff will enjoy working with you to design a great night.  I had the signature omakase paired with the Nobu Sake flight. Nobu has their own sake breweries. My meal was a sensual experience in the classic sense with a combination of visual and taste experiences beyond description.  My meal included the classics. Hand roll. Sashimi Salad. Yellowtail with jalapeno. Miso glazed Cod. Sizzling Beef tenderloin. But the sum is so much more than the parts. Paired with the top notch Sake, the various courses created a wonderful dinner experience worthy of the steep yet reasonable price.  The only drawbacks are minor. Some casino noise can overpower the occasional tourist group wanting gourmet spicy tuna rolls with their merlot. It takes a long time for dinner too, so plan at least two hours for a relaxed experience.  I am so glad I experienced Nobu in Las Vegas. It was simply amazing to experience the many dishes offered and the overall feel and help of the staff. They actually were happy that I was happy making it a great night. Highly recommended and worth it!",

A skinny lady at the bar was our server, she never greeted us or offered us the menu for at least 20 min after we sat down, and it was impossible to get her attention. She would turn around and talk to someone else when we were still talking to her without acknowledging or even eye contact. For a $200+ dinner bill for two, I expect better.",

Located in Cesar's Palace, this Nobu is the largest!  Ambiance is nice.  Dimmed lights, very romantic.  Everyone that we had encountered was kind & attentive to our needs.  Our server, Tyler, was top notch & we ordered everything that he recommended!  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno:  So fresh!  No soy sauce needed, just the sauce it comes marinated in is all you need.  Instead of ginger, they provide cilantro as a means to cleanse the palette.  Very neat.  Salmon Sushi (1):  Fantastic! Salmon Belly Sushi (1):  Seriously, the only sushi in the desert I will ever eat. Black Cod Miso:  A must order!  I repeat, a must order!  Move over Chilean Sea Bass, you have met your match.  The cod is marinated so perfectly, the sauce is sweet.  & it cut like butter into perfect thin slices.  I tried to take as little bites as I could to savor the goodness & literally wanted to cry when it was gone.  If I could do it again, I would order 2 more. Hamachi Kama:  This was supposed to be an appetizer size but because of the size, it was a meal.  Delicious!  When you make a reservation online, you will have to put your credit card information.",

I probably wouldn't have went there otherwise but I wasn't paying so I said, \"Why Not!\"   On the pricey side but well worth it...we ended up sharing many of the dishes.  We started with the edamame - it wasn't really anything special next time I would probably skip!  Maine lobster salad - I'm not a big lobster fan due to the texture but this salad was really good, highly recommended.  Wagyu Gyoza - the wagyu was super tender and flavorful!  Shrimp with the spicy garlic - one of my favorite dishes. Shrimp was tender and the sauce complemented it perfectly!  Lastly, we had the toban-yaki beef tenderloin - the meat was so tender it melted in your mouth. Defiantly a must try.  When I go back I will be trying the Japanese wagyu!  The staff was on point and service was impeccable, knowing every dish and what complemented it!  Of course this restaurant is on the strip so you will end up paying more but if you want a good night out and willing to spend the money, why not?",

Our waitress was superb, helpful and just fun. And we were seated just beyond the kitchen away from the stand alone tables in our own booth and simply had a fantastic experience.   And considering the freshness of the sushi plus the inventiveness and beauty of each dish, the Nobu signature Omakase at $150 pp was perfect. Along with a large pot of a crisp dry sake, it made for a wonderful night.   Highly recommend staying at the hotel and dining at Nobu (the room service from this place alone is well worth it).",

    "text": "I thoroughly enjoyed a business dinner here with a group of 7 others a few days ago. Once we got to Caesar's Palace, it was a little hard to find, but I hadn't been before and wasn't sure which direction to head in from the lobby. Thankfully, it's located pretty well away from the main gaming areas, so there's less smokiness in the air here. The ambiance is exceptional, and attention to every minor detail has been paid, from the lighting, to the furniture, to the custom-made dinnerware that is breathtaking with such beautiful edible creations on it.  The food was 5 stars, hands down, and some of the best I've had anywhere (especially the sashimi and the Wagyu beef!), but unfortunately, the service left quite a bit to be desired, especially for the fine dining experience that Nobu should be. My co-worker and I arrived a bit late due to a delayed flight, so our business companions had ordered a couple of appetizers to munch on while they waited for us. There were a few bites of edamame and grilled shishito peppers with a sauce (ponzu?). The edamame was standard, but the peppers were pretty tasty. Once we were all together, we decided to go with Omakase for us all -- basically a grouping of chef's selections which highlight popular dishes, and give you a bit of a taste of many dishes. In total, we had about 8 courses.   My favorites were the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno and the Wagyu beef. The salmon sashimi was also very good. The yellowtail tasted so fresh and clean with the jalapeno. If I hadn't known how many other courses were coming after this (our first dish), I could have happily eaten this all night. A testament to the quality here: I ate wasabi. Happily. This is a miracle, Yelp friends. The salmon sashimi came with wasabi (real Japanese wasabi, mind you, not the green horseradish served in 90% of sushi restaurants), Chinese mustard, capers, and saffron. It was amazing! Mild horseradish-ness and a bit sweet from the real wasabi. Genius flavor pairing, like many of the dishes here. The Wagyu beef... I kind of have no words. This is real Wagyu beef here, they don't just call it that on the menu, and you can taste the difference. It's served raw on hot stones, which a server then sets aflame to cook the beef to your desired temperature (medium rare for our table). It's served with an Asian dipping sauce, which was tasty, but which I just skipped. The beed melts in your mouth. Literally. It melts. Heaven! And the stones are placed in rock salt on the plate, which gets smoked a bit from the cooking of the beef. Eat some of the salt and thank me later. Wow, what a dish!! Honorable mention goes to the blackened Alaskan cod with miso. It was very tasty as well. Having not been before, the tasting-type menu was certainly the way to go, but next trip in (and there WILL be a next trip), I know *exactly* what I'm ordering.  The only miss here was the service. It wasn't bad perse, but not up to par for a 5 star, fine dining experience. They seem to cover tables in \"teams\" here, with one lead server for the table, then many who drop off food, refill waters, etc. That's all great, when everyone is on the same page. Our dinner service stretched over about 3 hours. During that time, I was able to order only 2 glasses of wine (geez, I sound like a real lush here, huh? I would have liked about 8, but... Lol!). When our server who actually did any of the order-taking (drinks, etc.) would come by, she wouldn't check with everyone if they wanted another cocktail, even if their glass was low (loud restaurant + separate conversations = easy to miss her). Then, the round of drinks that had been ordered took 20-25 minutes to arrive. I assume the bar was backed up, but it seemed like a very long time. Meanwhile, waters weren't refilled and I was thirsty through much of the latter half of the meal. Also, several of our courses came out on top of each other, rather than one following another. There just seemed to be timing issues. Some will think I'm being super nit-picky here, but I don't think this feedback is out of line for the prices at Nobu, nor the expectations of a fine dining establishment. None of this would preclude me from coming back or from recommending Nobu. Overall, dinner was lovely, and if you're in the mood for some delicious Japanese inspired dishes, I think you should head on in!",

I was in Vegas for a convention and decided to treat myself to a nice sushi dinner.  I ended up getting the $125 omakase which has sushi but also some of their popular hot dishes.  It was a very well-rounded meal and I left full and satisfied!  They asked me about my dining habits before the meal and if I had a time limit.  I ended up spending almost two hours at the sushi bar but enjoyed myself watching and interacting with the sushi chefs. My waiter was very attentive and every dish was described in detail by the chef or the food runner.  They explained what should be enjoyed together and what order they recommended eating each bite in to experience the best flavors.    Their signature dishes were amazing.  I really wasn't interested in hot dishes but honestly the Black Cod Miso was phenomenal.  The fish was perfectly cooked and flavorful.  The sushi chef overheard me talking to a neighbor about my favorite being uni and as a nice surprise he added it to my final sushi tasting.  Overall I had a great experience and all the flavors were on point.  My waiter took very good care of me and was helpful in suggesting Japan's top craft beer instead of the normal Kirin or Sapporo. I plan on returning with my wife and getting the second tier omakase meal.",

I sat at the sushi bar and only had sushi.  The sushi chef was cordial, but not overly friendly.  I had the feeling that this was more of a sushi factory (albeit a high quality factory) than a high quality sushi experience.  - The amberjack was amazing.  Full of flavor.  I've never had amberjack that had this much richness with just a hint of fishiness - The toro was nice and fatty.  Not quite as fatty as I would expect, but still very nice - The aji was average.  I've had much better elsewhere - The live octopus was seriously the best octopus I've ever had.  Just wow.  Why do other sushi places even serve that purple octopus jerky? - The golden eyed snapper was rich and full of flavor.  Not something you usually get with snapper - The Santa Barbara uni was Santa Barbara uni.  Smooth, sweet, and creamy - The flying fish was ok.  Unique fish, but not a unique flavor - The Japanese barracuda was meaty and fishy.  I enjoyed it - The jumbo clam, which I'm not a huge fan of, was better than average.  I only had to chew 32 times instead of 50.  It also had more flavor than cardboard - Loved the Japanese mackerel.  The lemon juice and sea salt really brought out the flavor  So overall, it was very good.  Not a great value and definitely not in the special category, but solid.",

We tried a couple salmon tacos and they were ok, nothing memorable. We got a yellowtail roll and tried some new style sashimi, both very good. We ordered another roll that was off menu and really enjoyed it. We finished with two desserts and we're definitely stuffed.

First off - it's Nobu and it's pricey so at the least I thought service would be top notch but honestly Cheesecake Factory gives better service. Our waiter sucked knew nothing and was dismissive of us when 3 of our sushi dishes (we only ordered 6 dishes total) never came. The three we ate were really bad. Those tempura rock shrimp remind of a Trader Joe's pop in the oven version, only worse. Then to top it off - they charged us for 1 of th 3 dishes we never got and when I asked manager to take it off (after telling him food was horrid) he showed no concern about the food or terrible service and acted like he was doing us a favor by taking the dish off of our check. Don't waste your time or money at this joke of a restaurant.",

We had the Tuna Tatake, Black Miso Cod and Soft Shell Crab over Golden Watermelon.  Amazing!   The first time we visited a Nobu we thought that we would be getting sushi but we ended up ordering hot & cold plates off the menu and specials and have never gone wrong.  You can get good sushi at a lot of other places.  I highly recommend going with the other items on the menu and trust your server on the special and amount of food to order!!  The service was great - a sure sign of this is the fact that as soon as I sat down they noticed I had black pants on so they swapped out my white napkin for a black one.  I LOVE that (another restaurant we had been at that weekend had to search around for a black napkin once I started getting lint on my black dress)!  Be aware that it is a little pricey, but in my opinion well worth it.",

He did not bother to explain any dish and bypassed having any menu discussion and order for our entire table.  Half of our group did not agree with this method of ordering but the server proceeded regardless.  We tried to intervene but he had already placed orders for us.  Each round of dishes were dropped and barely identified.  Tastes were decent but the quality was no where near the price range and lack of front staff professionals.  I feel cheated by our horrible service and lack of any effort.  Never again will I eat here",

I live for consistency and Nobu never disappoints!  Every restaurant these days has a variation of Nobu's menu items. Everyone now has rock shrimp, the jalapeno yellowtail, lychee martinis.....but nobody can compare!   If it's your first time at Nobu try the Miso cod. It's phenomenal!! The Rock shrimp (spicy) is a classic fried shrimp in a spicy mayo sauce (can't go wrong) and not really so \"spicy\".  I love that they use real lychee juice in their martinis rather than lychee puree or liquor.   No dinner is ever complete without dessert! We always get the chocolate bento box but this time they had BUBBLE GUM Ice cream! Very subtle flavor and anyone that knows me knows I'm a sucker for anything bubble gum or cotton candy flavored!   If you are debating on going! Go! You won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "(2.5 stars) I almost dread writing this review because prior to our dining experience I expected to give it 5 stars, phone home to my momma to tell her how great it was and then fantasize about the food for weeks until our next special occasion, however, that is not the case.  We were greeted by 3 sweet lovely hostesses and seated promptly when we arrived. Perhaps one luxury of being a local is being prepared with proper dinner attire and getting a baby sitter but I guess for some that's asking a bit much. It almost felt like Olive Garden with the casual outfits and all the children. Even the service staff uniform is black tshirts which is much different than the white long sleeve button up shirts that we are used to in most fine dining restaurants.  Dinner was $470 for the two of us including gratuity. We enjoyed our meal but it was nowhere near orgasmic (can I write that?). Keep in mind we like ponzu, my husband actually loves it but this was overkill. We had a shrimp and lobster roll that was great, mixed cerviche that was the highlight of our meal and tartar which was  ground up beyond recognition and somehow swimming in some sauce, a large sake that we only finished half of (don't order large unless you're an alcoholic, a party of 4 or a conisouer of sake), smoked salmon which was the equivalent of warm locks on rice, yellowtail that was good, the house roll that was also just good and a few other \"good\" items.   Our server seemed like a nice guy but he wasn't exactly smooth in his deliverance and he wasn't very personable. He was in no way deserving of the 15% we left him but it's basically against my religion to leave anything less. I couldn't tell you his name to save my life but I can certainly compliment all the food runners and the bussers. They were very detailed in their explanations of the food and quick to get rid of used plates.  It's probably too late to say long story short but Ill say it anyways, long story short it's \"good\" food, very pricey, small portions, loud and more of a happy hour atmosphere than the fine dining experience that I thought it would be. I could have gone to AYCE in my yoga pants with my 2 year old and have been just as happy so I doubt we will be back because we love Sushi Samba at the Palazzo much better for a fun sushi/Peruvian dinner.",

    "text": "To start off, Nobu has, hands down, one of the best restaurant decor & ambiance. It's super chill & laid back. We were seated quite quickly (5-10 min wait with a reservation) at a low, round couch like table which was extremely comfortable and we also had a great view of the whole restaurant.  Our waitress was patient and very helpful in explaining the menu and also recommending Nobu's most famous & popular dishes (Sometimes her lip smacking got the best of me...but that can be overlooked). What we ordered: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno (4 stars): I think this dish was well plated, really simple and delicate. The jalapeno complimented the flavors of the yellowtail well, a good hot substitute for wasabi. I would never think to pair the two, but the flavors really merged well. Nobu Sashimi Tacos (4 stars): We ordered 4 tuna, 2 salmon, and 2 lobster. I think all were really  tasty. The shrimp cracker like shell made each bite crunchy and delicious! I recommend the tuna and lobster. Broiled Alaskan Black Cod with Miso (3 stars): I'm not going to lie...I was underwhelmed. Yes, the texture of the fish is melt-in-your-mouth soft and flaky but the flavors didn't wow me. Tasted awfully similar to the miso my mother made when I was growing up. Nothing spectacular or out of the ordinary considering Nobu is \"Japanese with Peruvian flair.\" Not sure I tasted the flair part at all in this dish.  Overall, I think Nobu met my expectations. The decor bumps it to 4 stars otherwise I'd give the food 3.5 stars.",

Having dined at various Nobu locations, we have always wanted to order Omakase --but had reservations on it since I've been pretty particular about my sushi dishes.  I typically order the same things but definitely wanted something different.  This time around was different as I was open to eating anything and everything prepared.  It may be because I was unsure of what to order.  Nobu offers three different levels of Omakase.  We decided on the 2nd selection.      We sat at the sushi bar, which allowed us to watch our sushi chef prepare each finite detail to our sushi dishes.  It was nice that each dish was already prepared with its specific accoutrement --so there was no need to soy and wasabi it up.  I definitely ate dishes that I wouldn't have picked out in a menu --Omakase is the way to go for sure.  With it being pricey, I would say for special occasions and as long as you are open to eating everything.  By the end of our meal, my dress fit a little more tighter.  I tend to feel that when eating sushi I do not overeat, which is good thing, but I was definitely full and satisfied with the meal and service.",

He was attentive, friendly and offered to order for our table.  He did not disappoint!  Michael chose a mix of raw dishes and cooked dishes, all of which were out of this world.  The rest of the staff at Nobu was equally attentive and helpful.  Some of our favorites were the rock shrimp tempura, crab tempura (OMG, the best), miso black cod, snapper with dry miso and the sizzling beef on a stone paired with lobster.

My husband got up to go to the restroom and left his napkin on the table and within 10 seconds someone was there folding it up nicely for his return.   Very very pricey, like $700 later pricey. But glad we went.  *Japanese sushi chefs ( hard to find around here) If the hostess is going to greet guests in Japanese, please teach them proper pronunciation. Some of these girls are just down right offensive sounding, like a dying robot... its one word, learn it.",

To be honest, you don't need to waste time anywhere on the menu aside from the page with the fresh fish (nigiri and sashimi).  If you choose to order anything else, I recommend the black cod sliders in butter lettuce cups as well as the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno.  Back to the important stuff... We got the following nigiri:  Albacore Aged blue fin tuna (HIGHLY recommend) Japanese red-eye snapper Japanese golden-eye snapper Chu-toro O-toro Sweet shrimp (with the fried head... be brave and do it... it is delicious!  Make sure you bite off all of the spikes first or you will cut your mouth!) Yellow tail Yellow tail belly Mackerel Scallop  Service was excellent.  Sit at the bar for a show.  Sushi chefs made it all the more better and are masters at their craft.  What are you waiting for?    P.S. Eat a few pieces of nigiri for me when you go!",

Having dined at previous locations in New York, San Diego and the Bahamas, the customer service single handedly provided by (who we found out later to be the General Manager) Bryan Shinohara was above and beyond our expectations and previous experiences. As two twenty two year olds (yes we're young but we're second generation fine dining foodies), my best friend and I were craving the best sashimi Sin City had to offer and after a Nobu siting we had decided there was no where else to go but here.   Each staff member we had been in contact in were of the upmost respectful and delightful waitstaff in town. Offering personal recommendations tailored to our tastes and the extra insights from the GM Bryan himself truly made our experience. By taking the time to understand our taste and cravings they were able to custom make the ideal menu for us.   Must try all of their sashimi, seriously, do it! And don't forget my new favorite: the black cod lettuce wraps, an off the menu item specifically recommended to us by Bryan. The perfect way to end a delightful dinner.   Beautiful ambiance. Exquisite sushi. Superb staff. This will definitely be added to my \"Las Vegas Must Do's\" alongside the likes of Cirque and Olives and continue to be one of my favorite chains of all time...'til then I hope my San Diego location will offer an experience comparable to that of Caesar's.",

    "text": "I guess I really don't need to write a review since it really doesn't matter what anyone says people will continue to flock to this famous restaurant. But let me do one anyways for kicks.   We came here for a late night snack after shopping at the outlet. Made reservations for 9 pm - came in on time and the restaurant was packed still, but we were seated promptly at our table. At first glance I thought it would be ridiculously uncomfortable to sit at the low tables but they were very comfortable and fit the atmosphere well. Music loud and beautiful people everywhere(obviously me included) like a night club. The waitress came by, who (I must admit) was also beautiful, decided our menu for us. We told her what we liked and disliked and how much we wanted to spend. $150 for both of us I told her, she had to clarify and say each or for the table. Since the mid range omakase is like $200 per person. Trying to be cool and not look cheap - I told here we had dinner already, which for the record is the truth.   The 4 dishes came they were all excellently prepared and delicious (yes 4 dishes for $150 including tax and tips). The food runner different for each dish it seems explain exactly what we were eating and how to eat it.  The experience was great, from the night club like atmosphere, to the service and the food, one must eat a Nobu at least once in a life time to say they did it.",

    "text": "I visited Nobu in NYC over 15 years ago and it remains one of the top two or three restaurant experiences I've ever had. our table of four and the waiter were completely in sync. he noticed what we liked, made suggestions, worked with us on wine and it was a 2+ hour transcendental dining experience. my expectations were set very high for the Vegas location. unfortunately, I was a disappointed.  the food was exceptional (except for one dish, details to follow). I highly recommend the Yellowtalk with jalapeno, toro tartare, black cod in miso and the squid \"pasta\", which is not really pasta but a fantastic bowl full of grilled squid and fresh vegetables in an excellent broth. there was a special of tuna carpaccio with truffle and crumbled almonds that was out of this world. a gigantic miss was the monkfish pate which tasted way too fishy and had a sauce that was way too salty. we couldn't even eat half of it, but to the server's credit, she took it off the bill  now, the reason I can't rate this higher...  I have never been afraid to pay excessively high prices when the food, service, reputation and atmosphere dictate it. I have been dining at top restaurants around the world pretty much my entire adult life, including Vegas. here, there is a premium added to the the price of everything and it's expected and part of the experience. however, that's not an excuse for an atmosphere that isn't in line with the food quality and the price.  our waitress was nice and seemed knowledgable about the food, but anytime we asked for a recommendation, she automatically picked the most expensive item in that category. not once or twice, but every time. it was uncomfortably obvious. there was little conversation about what we liked or didn't like so far, she just wanted us to order the most expensive things on the menu. very off-putting. our table for two was very close to the kitchen door and on the outside row next to a corridor where drunk, loud people were passing by. at these prices, a little more attention to the ambiance surrounding each table would have been appreciated.  dinner for two, with one cocktail each and no dessert, was $280 before the tip. I wouldn't say we were stuffed, just comfortable. we could have easily eaten a few more dishes but didn't want to overdo it.   as mentioned, an expensive meal is totally okay with me, and the food here was divine, but the experience is just not worth it. there a so many great restaurants in Vegas, at all price levels so we have no reason to return to Nobu. I'm glad to have had the chance to eat here, but was very disappointed.",

We took advantage of Nobu's Room Service because we were staying at the Nobu Hotel (newly opened boutique 180-room hotel at Caesars Palace).   Please expect a $5 room charge as well as included gratuity in your order.  Black Miso Cod - So flaky, perfectly sweet, and seasoned beautifully.  Every bite was consistent and no portions were over-cooked in the slightest  Nobu Fries - A great add-on appetizer to your meal, consisting of traditional steak cut fries along with sweet potato fries.  Comes with two dipping sauces which compliment the seasoning perfectly  New Men Ramen - A pork flavored broth with succulent, tender char siu pieces, the only downside to this dish was the noodles were slightly over-cooked.  I prefer a firmer noodle, which Daikokuya nails anyday  Yes, a very expensive price tag accompanies your dining experience (or in our case, our room service experience!) but it's well worth it.",

    "text": "I am out of praise. I am drained of \"wow\". While dining at NOBU, I used every iteration of \"OMG\" and \"This is amazing\". \"Superb\" describes the ambience. \"Excellent and attentive\" describes the service. \"Outstanding\" covers the description of each and every dish we sampled. \"Absolutely perfect\" was uttered after not one, not two, but three dishes. \"Unbelievable\" captured the entire evening. We made a reservation, a good call on a Saturday night, and were seated at a comfortable booth. Nobu's interior is lovely-mushroom-shaped lanterns float above the dark interior and low light creates an intimate dining experience. The table setting is charming, with a rock to prop your chopsticks upon. Our server gave excellent recommendations throughout the evening, and his first was my drink-a mango passionfruit concoction which was sweet and dangerous-zero taste of alcohol. A delicious start to the evening. We ordered edamame, which had delicious salt sprinkled atop. It was good! And then the fun began...we had SO many dishes, each outshining the next. Tiny tacos were the first to arrive. I popped a tiny lobster taco, and it was superb. Crisp shell with amazing lobster and a creamy sauce (we ordered another round of tacos later because they were splendid). Then the yellowtail with jalapeno, a signature of the restaurant. Outstanding. Heat from the jalapeno and clean, cold perfect yellowtail made for an amazing dish. Rock shrimp tempura was a huge hit-we ordered the standard sauce. Light and crunchy tempura with a buttery and tangy sauce, an absolute star  Later in the evening, we ordered the Chilean sea bass tempura-another hit. It was buttery and paired with a lighter sauce (ponzu, maybe?). That sauce was flavorful and interesting and so worth it. Pork belly skewers were next on the list. Incredible. Out of this world. So well-flavored and crisp on the top and melty (\"melty\" is not a word, but NOBU took so many of my adjectives that I am reduced to making up new words), creamy, flavorful goodness. It was a winner. And then-the black cod. Everything about it surprised me. It is a large piece of fish, and our group tentatively began pulling pieces off and using our chopsticks to break off segments. It is slippery, so I definitely struggled But once I got it situated and took a bit, I was floored. So buttery, so flavorful, so rich, so decadent, and so unmatched. It is a must order. Just glorious. Phew-I am reviewing our meal in the order we ate each dish, and I need a moment to bask in the glow of the black cod before moving on. It was a masterpiece. Okay, I'm ready Right after the black cod dish, we shared a simple salmon roll (cut). Honestly, I was not expecting much, and this roll surprised me-it was incredibly flavorful. After that second round of tacos and the sea bass tempura, we ordered dessert The doughnuts were suggest by our server, and they were great! A well-made donut with creamy chocolate, a rich berry sauce, and ice cream dusted with hazelnuts was a perfect way to end a perfect evening. I had high expectations for my first Nobu experience, and Nobu surpassed those expectations",

    "text": "\"Amazing\" is the word to describe this dining experience I had with this place. I was lucky to have got a really informed server who told us the best dishes they are known for and what to order. I was taken here for my birthday surprise dinner from my girlfriend. They sat us down and first gave us the drink menu. We ordered one cocktail drink forgot the name of it but i knew it had Li Hing Mui powder around the brim of the glass. After we ordered our drinks, they then gave us the food menu. Really sad they didn't have uni at that time Becuase they get it shipped fresh. Which I understand for this high end dining it needs to be served fresh! We ordered a couple things so the server suggested the Black cod fish dish that they are known for. It was so good!!!!! We then ordered lobster tacos, oyster shooters, salmon rolls, and sea bass skewers. Trust me they may seem little but each bite was exquisite! Then lastly we ordered the Vanilla Tart and bento box for dessert with a happy birthday for me on them. Overall my experience with Nobu has got to be the best Las Vegas strip restaurant I ever had. Will come back again when we get that fat paycheck. Ahahaha",

Food and drink menu are pretty much the same as other locations. Food was good as usual. Unfortunately, our server ruined our experience here. She was not very attentive and thoughtful and didn't come to us often enough for working at a high end restaurant and for the money we spent here. All the bus boys and the servers who brought our dishes were great though! We ended up giving them a big tips rather than our own server because she was not on the Nobu standard.   For the food and the service we received from the bus boys, I will give this location a 3 star review.",

    "text": "This isn't just a restaurant - this is an EVENT First of all, let me say that I screwed up my reservation date and the Nobu staff was very gracious and understanding. They got us in without a problem. The entire evening was incredible! The feeling of the restaurant is contemporary and stylish, yet warm and romantic. We decided to try the tasting menu, it was $125 per person, but worth every penny! My husband and I tried things that would have never crossed our palate had we not opted for this choice. I believe it was 8 courses, but I kind of lost track after four. I really enjoyed the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos, salmon tartare with caviar, cod (their signature dish) and the dessert of molten lava cake and green tea ice cream. For drinks I had the Dalia and the Mango Passion, both were delicious, but the Mango was my favorite (It was recommended by our waiter). The drinks were kind of pricey at around $17. This is probably not the kind of place you would go to every week, well maybe you would if you can afford that kind of thing. Our bill with tip came to about $400. I would highly recommend it for special occasions and for Vegas tourists that want a truly unforgettable experience!",

The tuna belly with truffles was a splurge, but unique and worth trying.  2. Scallops with uni butter were delicious, but not as \"special\" as number one.  Probably wouldn't reorder.  3. New York strip ...  Nothing special.  Not sure why we ordered steak in a sushi place.  Tried two sakes ... Both were not the top end, but we're really great and enjoyed by all.  Caesars is definitely a more convenient location, but think I like the feel and vibe at the hard rock better.  Always an amazing meal here.  Servers were pretty knowledgable, however I did feel they were constantly looking for ways to recommend the most expensive alternatives ... They also made a mistake and triple charged me for a 60 dollar menu item.  Suspicious ... But they fixed it.",

I ordered the black cod with miso because I loveeeee cod, but this cod did not taste like how it was described on the menu.  It was sweet, with overpowering sweet maple-tasting sauce, not what I thought of when I think miso soup. Anyway,  the sweetness was so overpowering I couldn't tell if I was, in fact, eating cod.  I had it packed and stored it in my hotel room's fridge because I just didn't like it.  In hindsight, I shoulda sent it back a la Gordon Ramsay style and ordered something else.  The yellowtail roll with scallion and the yellowtail with jalapeno was good. The salmon roll was ok.  Shrimp tempura was just two little pieces.  Disappointing and overhyped restaurant.",

Started with the yellowtail marinated in ponzu and Jalepenos. Bomb.  Then had salmon belly with a mustard sauce with crunch - I was skeptical but also ridiculously good. Then moved onto a baked cod that was marinated - apparently this was chefs specialty dish - also great. Next was an absolutely incredible wagyu filet with some sort of Asian chimichurri - simply amazing. Finished with a platter of various Tuna sushi selections, which were all good. Had 2 drinks each - dropped $400 - so definitely pricey BUT it was memorable enough that I felt compelled to write a 5 star review.",

My boyfriend and I were gawking at old food pics and both of us had the same Homer Simpson moment \"MMMMM......NOBU.......*drools*\"  I didn't realize I'd never left a review!   I've heard of NOBU through many different places obviously if you're a fan of good food you know this restaurant and have been, or want to come here at some point. I told my boyfriend this was gonna be our one \"break the bank\" dinner because I was stoked about it and needed everything off the menu!   Made reservations for two at 8:00PM, got there early but had to wait til 8. NBD. We had some drinks and came back.   Our waiter was very kind and attentive. Also let us know the must-haves. This is gonna be a long one y'all, we ordered so many different dishes lol.   FOOD:   Yellowtail Tuna Belly (5 STARS x INFINITY): I have never had a single bite of food knock me on my ass like this.... This piece of fish was far and away the best thing I've ever eaten in Vegas. We had three orders.  Tempura Fried Rockshrimp (4 stars): huge pieces of succulent shrimp tempura batter friend and tossed in a spicy sauce. This was great quality shrimp and I feel like it didn't need the frying or the sauce I would have liked to eat it by itself with butter or something simple like that.   Wagyu Beef Nobu style Taco (5 stars): it's super awesome wagyu beef in a light wonton taco shell. Just get it lol.   King crab Nobu style taco (5 stars): even better than the wagyu IMO. This is how crab should taste. I loved it.  Black cod miso (5 stars): I mean you guys knew I had to get this, right? And it was every bit as delicious as I expected. Incredibly flaky and juicy and cooked like no other fish I've ever had. To put such flavor in a such a mild fish is amazing to me. This lived up to all the hype.  Beef tenderloin Tobanyaki (5 stars): this beef is something out of a dream. Incredibly flavorful and cooked to med rare perfection. It is served in a hot pot to the table so we removed ours from the pot quickly so it didn't overcook.   It was a pricey meal, but we were prepared for that. Don't come here looking for a cheap meal. It's quality ingredients and prep and honestly deserves the price tag it has.   Every time we go to Vegas we will need to come back even if only to have some yellowtail belly sashimi!",

The hostess took our phone number down & never contacted us back so we came back in our own & was sat at a table 5 min later. I was really upset because I asked if we could sit at a bar or sushi bar we just wanted to order a couple of rolls. We were told to go look ourselves & that there wouldn't be anything available but then I saw someone walking two other girls back to a sushi bar after I had just asked an hour before..   The sushi was really good & so was our service once our server came to the table. The wait for the rolls was extremely long though. We ordered the yellow tail & scallion roll, the shrimp tempura & the lobster roll for 2 people & I was still pretty hungry but didn't want to wait again for more. Will probably come back to sit at the sushi bar but will not be waiting again like I did last night that was extremely upsetting.",

    "text": "We got lucky and snagged 5:45 PM reservations on Friday night.  The restaurant is inside Caesar's Palace. The ambience is more upscale than the other restaurants on the property. It has an open feel to it despite being in-between two busy hallways on the Caesar's property. You won't be able to tell unless you're either right up front or way in the back of the restaurant. Choose the middle dining area if you can.  My husband and I chose the $225 and $150 Omakase and a bottle of wine so we can share and compare the taste to Nobu in Malibu, CA. We were not disappointed.  We both had 7 courses. It started off with 3 cold dishes followed by 3 hot dishes and finished off with dessert. I didn't count the soup given at the end of the meal, before the dessert, as a course. The timing of the dishes could've been better but I didn't mind the unusual wait between courses because we had wine.   The fish selection and presentation was great. I told my husband that the chef made each dish \"fun to eat\". Every dish was delicious. All we did was order and sit back and enjoy the food. A couple of the dishes had 24k gold shavings in it. Well dang.   Our server was charming and knowledgeable. It was nice to converse with him about Nobu's signature dishes, drinks, and history. He was very attentive and even gave us a mini box of Nobu's chocolates before leaving. He didn't try to up sell us to get the higher priced omakase but we chose to order one so we can see the difference.  I definitely enjoyed Nobu and would come back again! Get the omakase and their signature award winning cocktail!",

The yellowtail was amazing, but the $100 truffle tuna carpaccio was meh.... if it was to die for I'd order multiple, but it wasn't worth the money... and I LOVE TRUFFLE!! The crispy rice was just alright too. We ended up calling it quits and going to eat at Bobby Flay Shark at the Palms for more sushi that was better priced . Two restaurants, one night....",

Drinks: Mango & passion  Peruvian caipirinha   Food:  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno- so fresh. So good.  Nobu crispy rice with big eye tuna- the only thing I would skip. I thought it was very bland.  Scallops with spicy garlic- this was so good!!!!  Wagyu gyoza- AMAZING! I don't think I will be able to ever eat gyoza anywhere else ever again.  Spicy salmon maki- this was the last item. Although delicious, everything else we ordered was so over the top this was just very basic.   Everything we ordered and drank was on point and hands down the best service we had at any restaurant in Vegas. Our waitress was friendly, personable, provided us with great suggestions and over all she was just phenomenal.",

Majority of diners are dressed up. My sister and I felt out of place compared to other diners lol. However, the staff treated us all the same so that was good. Service was good from start to finish.   My sister and I shared the lobster and shrimp with spicy lemon to share. We both got our own miso soups, sister got the tempura shrimp roll, and I got the sashimi dinner. I can't believe a miso soup cost $7 USD. The miso soup instant mix at home tastes better in my opinion and is more than half the price at Nobu. The lobster and shrimp were delicious. I'm not sure why I ordered a $64 USD sashimi dinner. I didn't eat much of the mackerel sashimi because I don't like the taste of it.   The bill for just myself came out to over $100 USD. Too overpriced imo.",

I hold SUSHISAMBA in pretty high regard for Japanese fusion cuisine in Vegas, but Nobu now takes top honors in my book.   I went with a group of five, and essentially did an omakase style meal. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu, and he helped the kitchen craft an astoundingly good meal for us based on our group's tastes, likes and dislikes, and dietary restrictions.   The meal was course after course of delicious sashimi dishes. The yellowtail and salmon were real standouts here. There was also a crispy rice with tuna dish that was really delightful. Black cod with miso was absolutely delicious. Everything was prepared and plated with an extreme attention to detail. From the shishito peppers to the wagyu beef served with onion straws and truffle oil, everything was excellent.  For dessert, we had some fried filled doughnuts, ice cream, and miso crunch tarts. All delicious, and very satisfying.",

Luckily I was able to sit and save four seats at the bar for my friends and me.  The food is absolutely phenomenal. We got their tasting pairing menu plus two grilled salmon and steak and shared among six people. This was way too much food. The wine and saki list is extensive.

I sometimes feel bad when I don't eat the rice. Chef Carlos was very sweet and made sure even if he gave me rice with my Sushi it was very light.

Listen, I'm spoiled, I've had the opportunity to eat at some pretty amazing places in my life due to a career spent on the road. This is one of the best meals I've ever had.   I went with my wife here who while being the most amazing woman on Earth is not the most adventurous person on the planet.  So instead of doing the Omasake (sp?) menu, I kinda did some research, figured out what I had to have, then asked the waitress to take those items and toss out some suggestions to make a custom menu.  Was not disappointed.    Now I like booze...so we did a Japanese Whiskey flight and a Sake flight, the $50 ones (separately, we're not barbarians people). Both were good, the waitress did a great job explaining all of them and was spot on in her description.    We did the usuals, Yellowtail w Jalapeno - delicious. Black Cod Miso - which will live on in infamy in my dreams for years to come - one of the best things I've ever eaten.  We did the Sashimi Salad - it was all right, nothing I probably couldn't get at the local Kona Grill. We did a king crap tempura thingy - it was stupid good - and I normally can't stand tempura - it was to die for. I did some Nigiri with Yellowtail Belly which was bueno and something else which was just marginal, but not bad.    Finished it off with the Flourless chocolate cake which was good - I'm not a big dessert guy, but wife enjoyed it.    Overall...yeah...$480 was a ton to drop on dinner. But I'd do it again in a heartbeat.    I'll see you in my dreams Black Cod Miso.",

We ordered some oyster shots, which were ok, but I've definitely had better oyster. We ordered some drinks with our meals i had the Spicy Acai martini, which was delicious and girlfriend had the lychee which she enjoyed as well. We ordered  lobster, but the amount of meat for a $70 price tag wasn't really worth it. The family had ordered \"real wasabi\" for the table, but with prior experiences it just didn't seem right. Our waiter was also not as attentive as we would like as i had to stop him everytime to order drinks and additional food. Overall the experience was pleasant and their food is definitely delicious!",

I did feel though that many of the dishes tasted similar / maybe too much like and cilantro ?? But worth checking out if you're into checking out different/Americanized presentation of sushi!",

If you can you should sit at the sushi bar instead of going for a table, you get your own personal sushi chef giving you their expert advise on how to enjoy their creations.   It is pricey, but lets keep it real what isn't pricey on this damm strip? If you can splurge a little for sushi, I would suggest you do it here.   My Lady and I ordered the \"Sushi Omakase\" which is a chef's choice of 14 pieces of unique nigiri sushi.  It averages out to about $10 per piece but it was well worth it. So good!",

My water glass and Sake glass was never empty. Our server was friendly, helpful and knowledgable about the menu and offerings.   We opted to create our own shareable menu for our table of 4- the 12 courses was just enough to fill us up without being miserably full. The food was amazing. Everything was so delicious and the fish was fresh. The Wagyu was like butter. My mouth is watering just thinking about it. The food presentation was stunning. The desserts are to die for! I wish I would have snapped photos, but as I was at a group supper it didn't happen.   I can not remember all the dishes that we tried, but here are a few of my favorites and MUST haves during your visit: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, Premium Japanese Wagyu, Maine Lobster with Wasabi Pepper and Toro Sashimi. The Desserts y'all! OMG the best things ever- Bento Box, Santandagi, Assortment of Mochi Ice Cream, Green Tea Royale,",

    "text": "The teppan table at Nobu was one of the top 3 or 4 meals of my life.  We had a 7 pm reservation on a Friday night.  This was the 5th time my buddy and I had reserved the teppan table.  The previous 4 we had been bumped for high rollers, so I was wondering if we would even get the table at all.  Fortunately for us, we did.   There are 2 teppan tables in Nobu with 8 seats each.  There were only 4 of us and no one joined us, so we were able to spread out and all had a good view of the chef.  The tables are kind of separated from the restaurant, so it's a much more intimate feel.  When we left, I was surprised to see a completely full restaurant buzzing with activity, that's how isolated you are from the regular dining room.   Our server (Andrew, who was fantastic) explained the menu to us.  They offer ala carte ordering, but like most teppan joints you've been to, most people chose a tasting menu.  They have several levels:  $125, $155, $190, $280 and the reasonable $688, which is a wagyu tasting menu that must be ordered in advance.  Given how good our meal was, I can only imagine how the $688 would be.  I am sure on my next trip to Vegas I'll hit a progressive and try it.  Our table of 4 decided on the $190 menu, but with crab fried rice instead of chicken fried rice.  Additionally, 3 in our party added a seared foie gras bun, which was $50.  The wine list at Nobu is solid for Vegas.  The somm was great, we ordered a magnum of cab and when he didn't have the bottle, he offered us 2 bottles of a better vintage for the same price.  What Nobu does have is (as expected) a great Japanese whiskey selection.  2 of us went with the $40 flight and I am very glad I did.  All 3 whiskeys were fantastic, and it got me curious about Japanese whiskeys, which have been receiving high praise for some time now.  I don't think I have enough room in this review to adequately describe every dish, so I will give you what we had and then highlight a few items.  This is what the $190 tasting menu came with at our visit:  blistered Shishito, Yellowtail Tartare, Sashimi Salad, Japanese Scallop, Chilean Seabass, Japanese Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, Scallop in Cilantro Sauce, crab fried rice (usually chicken) and a coffee flavored dessert with whiskey foam.  The Japanese wagyu was my favorite of the evening, and the second best steak I've had in my life (after the riserve ribeye at Carnevino for those keeping score at home).  It was filled with veins of fat that melted into flavor during cooking.  It is served with 3 sauces, but I only tried 2 of them and didn't use them during the meal.  The steak is too good to mask with sauce, even sauces as good as these.  Additionally, it is served with an asparagus and mushroom salad, soy salt, and fried garlic.  The fried garlic was fantastic (it's the stuff that looks like tiny cornflakes in the picture).  I had every intention of copying this at home, until I found out that the process takes over 24 hours.  I could eat a full bowl of this stuff.  A bite of the steak with fried garlic and some soy salt was the best bite of my 4 nights in Las Vegas.  To be honest, probably one of the better bites of my life.  I don't know if a $50 3 bite sandwich can be called a bargain, but the seared foie gras was.  Of course it's ridiculously expensive, that's the markup you pay for eating on the Las Vegas strip at an iconic Japanese restaurant.  However, the foie gras is also fantastic quality.  The sear adds only a slight crust to the exterior, the foie gras is left with that great umami flavor and mouth feel.  I absolutely would get this again and highly recommend you do the same.  The chilean seabass was cooked perfectly and served in a balsamic teriyaki sauce that was sweet & syrupy but not too heavy.  I could have just ordered a large filet of this fish and been very satisfied with my meal.  The crab fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was served toward the end of the meal, which was new to me.  I devoured this stuff, I could have eaten another bowl, and this was after all of the food we had already eaten.  It had some nice heat, everything was prepared well, and the seasoning was spot on.  If you don't get this with your tasting menu, I would say it's well worth it for the table to add it ala carte.    The yellowtail tartare was another table favorite.  Served with caviar in a fantastic sauce (you get so much stuff it's hard to keep track and remember what everything was, so all I know about this sauce is I like it), it was tartare of the highest quality.  The surprising dish for me was the king crab tempura.  Light but with a great tempura crunch, this was a fantastic dish.  I liked everything, but a couple of the dishes had too much cilantro for my preference.  But, that was the only thing I could nitpick about in my entire meal at Nobu.  Finally, I cannot think of a meal more appropriate to act as my 900th review than the teppan table at Nobu.  I hope I am back very soon.",

    "text": "Let's be honest, I've always known about Nobu and how great it is from word of mouth/yelp reviews, but what actually brought me here was on a whim after listen to that Jump Man song. After giggling about how weird it is to sing NOBU NOBU NOBU NOBU, we decided on a fly to make a reservation a few months out. Well, it has met all of my expectations and a little more.  We had a 5 star experience once we were at the restaurant, but the only gripe I have is that I made a reservation for early May way back in early March. When the time got closer, I had to reschedule due to an obligation, and when I called in, it looks like my reservation was never put in the calendar. The hostess asked me if I had the right location, which I did, so I just made a new reservation. So if you're looking to make a reservation, I would call a few days ahead just in case so you don't run into what happened to me!  We had the omakase dinner, and the waiter will take your preferences and dietary concerns to create a tasting menu with the chef. We wanted about half hot dishes and cold/sushi dishes, and I requested dishes that weren't heavy on dairy (since I'm lactose sensitive). We started out with the champagne 95 and grapefruit on the rocks. Both were great! The champagne 95 was fresh/crisp/refreshing with orange liquor, peach liquor, and pineapple & roederer champagne. The grapefruit on the rocks tasted more of just grapefruit juice without much of a kick or other flavor besides grapefruit.   All dishes we got were amazing to a point that I can't speak highly enough of our waiter, Columbia, creating such an extraordinary menu. The only things I didn't really care for was the beef toban-yaki. The beef toban-yaki is in an ancho chile sauce, and I think that's what threw me off. The sauce was a little too intense for me, but I also think that this dish would be a favorite for many other people. It's just not for me, but it might be for you... so try it out and make up your mind for yourself.   My favorite items happened to be the cheapest (you could say i'm a cheap date, I guess??). They were the yellowtail sashimi w/ jalapeno, spinach salad with dry miso, and the salmon sashimi new style. Each had great flavor and were so unique in their own right. The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was served with ponzu sauce. It was slightly sweet, savory, and absolutely perfect. The spinach salad with dry miso was fresh, and the miso dried miso gave it a nice, salty crunch. The miso is broken up into very small pieces, so it isn't so overwhelmingly salty.  List of what we got: Champagne 95 Grapefruit on the rocks Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno Spicy miso chips with big eye tuna Spinach salad with dry miso Salmon sashimi new style Black cod miso Rock shrimp with jalapeno sauce Beef toban-yaki 2 scallop with wasabi salsa 2 albacore sushi 2 tamago sushi 1 miso tart  Overall, I would come back to Nobu for maybe a special occasion or if I'm feeling zesty. The food is amazing and the service from the waiter is extraordinary. I would get the omakase again. The only reservation about Nobu is the hostesses making your reservations. You should definitely call a few days ahead to confirm your reservation.",

My boyfriend & I celebrated our anniversary here, I made reservations just in case it gets packed. Environment is super nice, cozy and romantic. Staff was attentive, great customer service.  We ordered: Sashimi Platter Premium: Super fresh and delicious! 13 pierce, the otoro melts in your mouth! The wasabi is freshly grinded! Uni Shooters: Loved it, super fresh and had a good amount of uni. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: The yellow tail was so good, it tasted like otoro. it melted in your mouth and the sauce went super well with it Lobster & Wagyu Taco: Very good. I prefer the lobster one more! Rock Shrimp: Delicious! Must order this asian fusion dish! Premium Japanese Waygu: MUST MUST MUST order. They roast the Waygu on some hot stones in front of you. It is the best meat I have ever eaten to far. It is worth every penny! Pork Belly Miso Skewer: Pretty good, kinda salty, but the pork belly was roasted well. Japanese Bento Dessert: Delicious! The lava cake was amazing and the green tea ice cream tasted very authentic!   Overall this is one of my top favorite restaurants. I would definitely come here again. Next time I do want to try their chef's special, it comes with hot + cold dishes and you can set a price limit per person and the chef will accommodate!   Thank you Nobu for making my anniversary dining experience amazing!",

The bill after tip came close to almost $1000 including three bottles of seltzer water.  We left with empty stomachs. We assumed they don't serve regular water at this swanky spot. Our server was a nice guy, knew his stuff but found him speaking too fast and not very personable.    We also sat next to Amir Johnson of the Boston Celtic's and his girlfriend. We chopped it up a bit with him, very chill guy, and he knows how to use chop sticks!",

Starting with the hostess who seemed to have a bad day not wanting to smile or communicate even simple pleasantries (e.g. Have a nice dinner, etc.). The server turned out to be pretentious going on about how this Nobu is special and trying to upsell to the chef's special dinner. The rest of the dinner the server was rather elusive often requiring us to ask others to get our server. The only upside on service was the bus person who was very personable and genuinely wanted to make a connection (thank him for getting two stars on the review).  The food, especially for the price, was on the disappointing for the most port. Notable exception was the tatake. The miso black cod was on the mushy side and not the flavor from other Nobus. Waygu gyoza had an off taste. Requested a special role with eel and could have gotten something better from a gas station. Tried some other things but can't frankly remember them after a couple of days.  Not likely to visit this Nobu again given so many great choices in the area.   Sushi Samba and Tao are far, far better choices for both food quality and service!",

Also the brake between courses went up to 25 minuets with multiple courses arriving simultaneously 30 seconds apart. Food tested good but fail to see any Japanese Peruvian Fusion at all and I have been to Tanta in Chicago wick is amazing so bottom line is if you going to spend that kind of money go to bar Massa at the aria much bater.",

I had a girls night with my mom before seeing Rod Stewart (he was adorable) and we had no clue what to get! Our wonderful waiter gave great advice and now I shall share it with you. We started with the yellowtail and jalapeno sashimi appetizer. It was \"like buttah\"! A mild taste with appropriate sweetness, savory and 'kickiness' (I'm inventing words today). We then had the crispy rice with tuna... we would have had five more orders if we weren't pretending to hang with the Jones peeps. Next we had the crab tacos. Save your money here... two bites of deliciousness, but I wanted about four. Then it happened... the miso black cod came to the table. I managed my foodgasm moaning sounds so as to not get my mother and I kicked out of the restaurant. We succeeded, but it was hard. The fish was tender with a crispy skin. The combination of miso and saki worked magically together. This signature recipe is online! But apparently you need a brick oven to make it... off to buy bricks I go! Not really... I'll just come back again. We closed with the crab tempura. While it was delicious, I won't get it again. How could anything compare to the miso cod?! I left with a happy, full belly and will definitely be back. Now to work those extra shifts I need to afford this meal! But totally worth it! Thanks Nobu! Ps. Let the waitstaff know if you are seeing a show so they can speed up your order... but go with enough time to spare so you can enjoy a drawn out foodie experience and the company you came with.",

Of course everything is better when you don 't have to pay... but really the flavors here are unlike any other.  Nobu, for those of you that don't know, is a mix of Japanese and Peruvian flavors, which explains it's unique offerings.  For our dinner, we did not get menu's, the server asked what we liked and the chef catered the offerings to our tastes... the result was was absolutely incredible. (They do have menus though if you don't want to be surprised).  Some of the highlights of the incredible meal included: Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno Chilean Sea Bass with Dry Miso, or Balsamic Teriyaki  Black Cod Miso Sushi platter  Truthfully, everything was beyond perfection. I can't recall the names of everything that we tried that night but the chef did a wonderful job and I'd do it all again and again.",

I came here for a work related dinner. They basically did omakase for the table. The cooked food was generally good - the black cod miso in a lettuce wrap stuck out. The wagyu beef that you cook on hot stones was fun but it wasn't something I'd be jumping to try again - it got annoying when the stones started to cool down.   When it came to the raw fish, there was little difference in quality when compared to an average SF neighborhood sushi place. If anything their spicy tuna and california rolls (which they included in the omakase) were noticeably subpar - and they definitely used imitation crab meat for the CA rolls. Maybe decent sushi is an accomplishment out in the desert but I don't see why it should be as expensive as it apparently is (I didn't see the bill but the people taking us out did a double take.).  Adjusted for the price there are lots of better options.",

Very inattentive and disorganized staff. That being said, the food was very good. The fish was fresh and the plating was spectacular. The depth of flavors and uniqueness of the courses was appreciated , however they  forgot the miso soup and served it at the end of the meal. We will not be returning to Nobu's.

We ordered the nasu miso to start and then the sashimi/nigiri dinner.  Nasu miso was pretty good, and the sashimi and nigiri were average. The mackerel was probably my favorite, followed by the shrimp and salmon, but honestly, all I could think about was how we could have gotten this at a lower-end restaurant, and it would have all been the same.  We decided to order one more thing to see if Nobu could redeem itself, so we got a simple spicy scallop roll. BINGO! It was great. The nori was delicious, and so was the spicy scallop. Together, it was perfect.   I wish we had ordered more rolls, but we were way too stuffed. I'll definitely come back to Nobu, but I recommend getting their rolls rather than sashimi/nigiri.",

He assured us the tax, tip, etc was all taken care of. When we pushed, we found out he had been about to keep a $95 tip on a $105 tab. This was corrected before we left, but we had to wait a long time, and our server was no longer very polite. When we spoke with the manager about it later, she said the cashier had run the gift card without checking to see what the table check balance was, and apparently told the server that everything was taken care of. In this day and age, with electronic table ordering and such, I do not believe that neither the cashier nor the server would have been aware of the large discrepancy. The manager was borderline polite about the situation and refused to acknowledge that the staff had made a big mistake, which would have resulted in fraud on a senior couple. Too bad, because it ruined an otherwise very nice birthday dinner.",

The goods, the sashimi was super fresh, handsdown nobody can compare, uni was super creamy, toro had tge perfect texture, nothing to complain there.  Saw someone wrote about the jalapeno yellowtail, pretty accurate, not sure why they didnt just put the cilantro on the fish instead of the middle, the jalapeno had very little favor, the ponzu was a little bit salty.  The seaweed salad was good, but not great, sauce was not consistent, some had more sauce than others.  Probably better to mix it instead of leavijg them separate but I understand why.  The kama was tasty but lacked some meat.  The flourless cake was good as well.  The sashimi was a lot smaller and thinner than how it used to be as well :(.

And of course the food was delish!  Hostess Friendly, smiley and genuine. Great first impression.   Bar The bartender was friendly and could make one heck of a drink. I love ordering from the  cocktail menu and the bartender made some great suggestions.  Table Waitstaff was attentive, friendly and quick. Our server did a wonderful job with suggestions and answering questions on the menu. We had a party of 7 and were handled flawlessly  Sushi To die for! Really really wonderful. I don't know if I could list a favorite dish.   We will be back.",

    "text": "Nobu is by far the worst restaurant I've ever eaten at in Las Vegas.  I consider myself a \"foodie\" in that I go anywhere and am willing to spend whatever for the best food and more importantly for the greatest service and experience available.   I travel to Vegas 5 or 6 times a year, I'm not a gambler or a big drinker, I come here for the food.    Nobu specifically isn't bad food but at this price point it should be great food and a great experience.  The food is good at best but the service is terrible.  At first I thought it was just a random unlucky one off, but I now believe it's institutional here.  My waiter/server Matt, professed to be some sort of expert on the \"real\" Nobu experience.  In his opening remarks Matt offered to bring us through this experience, just let him know our comfort level based on price, things that we especially would love to eat as well as those that were a definite no way option and that he would create this culinary adventure and memory without comparison.  W ell this turned out to be True.  I told Matt that the price wasn't a problem, for me the only real no go was a texture thing.  I like sushi, I love great food and that I'm more of a Beef, Pork and Chicken person but would be open to whatever he recommended except the only \"No go\" for me would be slimly, gushy items.  The first thing he brought out was a yellowtail jalapeno dish.  Flavor?  Good, texture?  Terrible.  Matt asked what we thought, I told him that it had \"good flavor\" but failed on the texture scale and that it was exactly what I said I didn't want.  The next dish was almost the exact same thing only with some shaved almonds on it for \"texture\".  I made the same complaint.  Third dish, a Crab Ceviche on a bib lettuce cup. Okay now, I'd about had it, I took Matt aside and told him that he asked me what was a total no go for me and them proceeded to bring me three dishes in that category. I also told him I was able to somewhat muscle through these dishes, but if he noticed I didn't finish any of the dishes he brought out and that at nearly $300 per person, \"I do not want to muscle through my meal, I want to be able to sit back and truly enjoy it.\"  I pointed out each of the three times he visited my table that other people around me were eating appetizing dishes and that he hadn't been even close.  He then brought out a very good Sea Bass dish followed by a Wagu Beef dish that was excellent and then a tempura crab that was sub par at best and a chocolate lave cake with ice cream that was  so over cooked there was no lava and the edges were \"Hard\".  Overall the meal was $650.00.  Matt did not offer to remove any of the poor choice dishes, he didn't offer to buy us a drink and a manager of chef didn't stop by.  Nothing.  I am not a rearview mirror kind of guy and don't spend time fretting over things that already happened.  But this one bother me so much so that the next day I stopped by the restaurant to express my views about what happened.  I was promised that someone would call me in the middle of the day.  No one called, no one actually cares here and that is why waiters like Matt work there.  My advice, don't go, take your $650.00 and drop it in the machines.",

    "text": "We make a point to come here almost every time we're in Vegas (which is often) and we have never been disappointed.  We like the small plate/sharing concept, but also like that there are entree size dishes too (which we could also share).  The Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna is a must have - it's the ultimate umami dish. Hot crispy sticky rice cubes, salty sweet dipping sauce and a creamy cold tuna spread create a one of a kind flavor that melts your palate - it's seriously such a one of a kind flavor meld that you'll remember the first time you had it.  And  you'll want to get it again and again.  Black cod miso is Nobu's signature dish, it's so delicate and tender it's like butter, the miso glaze is sweet (but not too sweet) and the fish will literally melt in your mouth.  It's delicious with hot rice.  The Wagyu gyoza takes potstickers to new heights - the beef is tender, delicious and the scallions and shoyu take this common appetizer to first class.  The wonton wrapper isn't too thick (thick wrappers are a no no in my book) and they're steamed to perfection.  Scallops with spicy garlic was flavorful with pattypan squash, asparagus, and big fat scallops grilled and cooked perfectly.  The only miss was the creamy spicy crab - yikes, this should come off the menu.  The creamy spicy sauce was cloying and completely smothered the crab, it was buried under it. The crab was tough and not appealing.  The waiter noticed we didn't have much of it, asked if we liked it, we said no, he removed it from the bill.  Yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp tempura, and toro are also great.  Skip the tacos - they're overpriced and not that interesting.  Service is swift and attentive without being intrusive.  We never had to ask for refills and our used plates were quickly replaced with clean ones (which is great when you're having small plate dishes and mixing the flavors on a single plate doesn't always taste great).  If you like Japanese food with a hint of Latin flair, treat yourself.",

I had some sushi rolls and some teriyaki beef my buddy had the Chileign Sea Bass.  The reason for the three stars is because my buddy during dinner went to drink his water and as he went to put the glass to his mouth it shattered in his had not only did a full glass spill on him but he cut the inside of his hand.  Now I'm not about getting a free meal but when your bill is over $180.00 and something like that happens you would think they would at least offer you a free dessert especially cause my buddy cut his had and it was bleeding.  Just didn't seem right I've been to restaurants in the past and have waited longer than normal for a meal and the restaurants have offered a free desert or even taken the meal off the bill.  I just wasn't happy with the situation and kind of killed the excitement for me to go back like I always have when I come to Vegas and that frequently.  Great food but a little disappointed.",

However, I was invited to dine at Nobu and even be seated at the Teppanyaki table (they cook the food right before your eyes).   I almost had a heart attack when I opened the menu. Prices ranged from $5 for one piece of sushi all the way to $600 for a 12 oz. steak. Being at the Teppanyaki table, the best experience is to order from the teppanyaki menus which (excuse my lack of fancy vocab) was kind of like a 6 course meal. Everyone in the party ordered the same food course thing.  After a few minutes our chef, Nick, came over and introduced himself. Before cooking he asked if we wanted to see a \"quick show\". In just a few seconds he had his cooking utensils flying everywhere and spinning in a rhythmic, stylish manner. The tricks didn't  stop there; even while preparing the food, he would throw eggs in the air catching and breaking them with one swing of his spatula. I've seen magicians who aren't even as quick as this guy was.   Aside from the incredible sleight of hand, Nick was very fun to talk with and the whole atmosphere felt much more alive than just a chef cooking food. He told jokes and interesting stories. I would give Nobu 5 stars just for Mick's performance.   The food itself was outstanding. Being used to eating cheap and on a budget, this dinner blew my mind. The steaks were so tender that you could cut them with chopsticks (which are the main eating utensils). Everything was so well prepared and delicious (plus you get to see it made right in front of you). Even though the prices may be steep, you get more than just a meal; it's an experience.",

They do a great job of combining flavors that go well together but that I would not necessarily expect.    Despite being a large restaurant, the service was wonderful.  Our waiter was well informed about the dishes (and drinks) and the people who brought out our food explained exactly what everything was and offered suggestions on how to best enjoy the food.  My favorite is that they brought me a black napkin so I would not get white fuzzies all over my black pants.  This restaurant is pricy, but it is worth every penny.  If you skip alcohol and some of the more expensive menu items, you can keep your bill reasonable.  But the food is so good you will want to try everything!  We will definitely be back!",

For drinks had the cucumber margarita which was actually one of the healthiest things I've ever had (LOL). The drink has barely ANY alc but it is such a refreshing cucumber puree with a fresh lychee and cucumber slice. Definitely felt more like a relaxing drink at the spa!   For food had the yellowtail sashimi which had the best ponzu like (with I believe a sake reduction?) sauce and the most delicate jalapeno slides to add a little kick to the smoothness to the yellowtail. Then had the lobster ceviche which was to my surprise, lightly seasoned which I didn't mind. It comes out unlike traditional ceviche and comes out drier with seasoned lobster pieces and onions on top of lettuce wraps. Next had their famous black miso cod and OMG OMG OMG -- moment of silence for this because this dish, both in the way the fish is cooked (perfection) and seasoned is impeccable. The fish is SO tender and soft it literally melts with the miso sauce it is paired with. I can eat this all day everyday.   Next dish was their shrimp tempura which is lighter and more delicate than traditional tempura pieces which is deep fried to the max. Came with three sauces and loved the jalapeno crime. Then came the SCALLOP skewers (yes I get scallops at every place) and definitely one of the better scallops I've had because it was soft but sturdy enough to capture all the natural flavored and substance of the scallops. Finished off with a small salmon roll!  For dessert, ordered the Japanese hazelnut doughnuts which was more like a lightly fried dough bread with hazelnut spread inside and came with a raspberry sauce and ice cream. I liked but didn't love this because the dough was a little dry but enjoyed experiencing a different version of doughnuts!!  DEFINITELY coming back. Worth breaking the bank for!",

After deciding to say no to the 2+ hour wait for the Bacchanal Buffet, my two friends and I went roaming about Caesar's Palace for something more suitable. We saw the inviting environs of Nobu and thought a semi-fancy dinner would be OK. We were seated right away, which was great, and looked over the menu while soaking in the cool modern artsy asian ambiance.   Good thing we weren't that hungry, otherwise the damage would've been greater. We got an order of their Yellowtail Jalapeno appetizer, two orders of the Black Cod Miso with the lettuce cup preparation for easier sharing, and Beef skewers with the Anticucho sauce. I THINK we also got the chicken skewers too but now I can't remember. At any rate, everything was delicious; I'm not saying anything was bad, but we each ended up paying almost $50 (with tax and tip) for these little nibblies. The worst was the black cod miso--you get three measly bites per order, so that was $68 for two bites/per person, wow.   Maybe I'm a Philistine when it comes to fine dining, but this stuck in my craw (har har).  My only other experience at a Nobu was at the West Hollywood one during Dine LA and that was a great deal, so now I know that this just isn't the place for me at regular prices. Live, eat, and learn.",

We told this to our server and he explained the \"proper\" process for ordering at Nobu which was people typically order three dishes from the cold section first, then three from the hot section, and finish with sushi. The sushi was listed between $12-24 per roll whereas each of the hot and cold dishes were listed between $30-40 per item. We attempted to order the yellowtail and jalepeno sushi roll, but the server was adamant that we not get the sushi roll and instead get the matching cold appetizer (listed 3x as expensive). We decided to trust his suggestion to try a cold and hot dish. He became a bit pushy about how we should really try more than just one item from these sections. We felt pressured into ordering more of these items. Although they were definitely very tasty, after we left, we felt a little steam-rolled since the sushi we ate at the end of our meal (the one we initially tried to order) was exactly what we had been wanting the whole time. Overall the food is absolutely delicious but the servers need to back off the \"traditional\" process and allow the guest to order what they want.",

The sashimi was not Nobu quality and was inferior to that at many other Japanese restaurants I've been to. The restaurant itself had a strange layout without actual walls separating it from the noise of Caesar's hotel/Casino. It was also odd that the first thing you see when you walk in are flatscreen tv's over the bar which seemed tacky. I was more than happy to pay top dollar for an excellent dinner but I felt like this restaurant was merely living off its brand's reputation vs. offering a True fine dining experience.",

I've been to many sushi restaurants, high-end ones such as Nobu included. Everywhere from Manhattan to San Francisco. So this is definitely not a biased, uninformed review. High prices are fine, if you have the amazing food and great customer service to back it up. My fiance and I came to celebrate our birthdays here, which are only one day apart. My fiance told the hostess it was our birthdays and she said OK great. Yet at the end of our $250 meal, nothing came. It's really disappointing because I see on their yelp photos that they do honor some birthdays. I guess their staff wasn't in the mood. Furthermore, we ordered three sushi rolls. Two of them came out and I was wondering what kind of sushi restaurant serves their rolls separately. We ate the 2 rolls they brought and then I realized they don't serve them separately, they just forgot and we had to remind them. Cmon Nobu, this is not splitting the atom. And you're supposedly a fancy high-priced sushi joint, so please live up to that. You don't.   UPDATE: you know I just can't give them 3 stars because for such a pricy place, there's really no excuse for eh customer service. I came here specifically for our birthdays and I'm really disappointed that they did nothing. Even Olive Garden can send out a cheap sundae.",

I normally don't leave reviews, and when I do, they're usually positive. I've had sushi around the world, from Hong Kong to LA to Tsukiji in Tokyo, and while I didn't expect to have the best sushi of my life in Las Veags, I certainly didn't expect to have the WORST.   The visual presentation of the courses was cute, but that's about it--the sashimi was bland, the soup broth was burnt, and the oysters were mediocre at best. And even worse, we were still hungry at the end of this $600 colossal disappointment. We politely filed out complaints with the manager, who received our comments with condescension and refused to even apologize or attempt to offer anything that might have redeemed the night. He simply said, \"we appreciate the feedback\" and walked away.   But if you DO go here, do avoid the chef special or anything else that sounds fancy on their menu. TRUST me.",

On my recent trip to vegas with my mom, we visited the nobu at caesar's palace. The waiter was accommodating when I said we would probably want to order just a few sushi rolls. He didn't pressure us at all to order more. We ended up starting with the shrimp tempura, which was very good. But had I known how great the sushi rolls were, we would have skipped the tempura - or gotten tempura rolls. Btw, not typical tempura, as there is not traditional panko breading. The shrimp is fried, but doesn't seem breaded at all.  We ordered California rolls, tuna rolls, yellowtail with jalapeno rolls and spicy tuna rolls. They were fantastic. Ambiance is wonderful. Service was stellar. I had a beer and my mom said that the Arnold palmer was the best she has ever had.",

Walking around and enjoying the leisure stroll was just perfect before our 10PM dinner.  Impressive!!!! Kind of steals your breath away to see  how Chef Matsuhisa has fashioned his newest restaurant in the Empire (of the Rising Sun.. hehe). My Food&Wine mag arrived last month, and I brought it along with me for reading. His easy teriyaki recipe was being featured, and how perfect that I was now happening upon some awesome fish!!  Salivation commence. It was here I tried harajiki for the first time.  We took the reco of our Japanese server (cutie pie, with Japanese lilt) and ordered as she suggested: the hamachi sashimi with ponzu, jalapeno and cilantro. Heavenly. perfect balance. awesome. 5 or 6 petite slices. $28. we'd do it all over again and get another one (yah, right... only if we had won the jackpot).  Next we moved onto a lightly battered tempura rock shrimp size bowl with a spicy cream sauce over a bed of rocket($24). Though nicely battered and delicate, we didn't care too much for it. Better to have stuck to more raw stuff. Which we didn't...  As our next dish was the famed hamachi kama ($18) Course I did enquire about the MP for the toro kama. OUT! Not in from the fish market (Tsukiji?). so no go (no worries: we both still got to experience our first O Toro in roll form)   It was SOO DARN GOOD we just kept at it. The flavor... was awesome. Nice deep grill flavor, fish around the collar was super duper tasty, and fresh, firm, yummy. And with fresh young ginger to rinse off the palate in the form of slender pink sticks (harajiki), it was too good.  Then the masterpiece: a complete 6-8 piece cut roll of O Toro ($10).. the mighty blue fin! Did we feel some guilt? yes, we did. But did it melt and just sit like silk on the tongue?!! WHY YES IT DID!  loved the dinner.  Experience and ambiance a sure hit. Solid, fresh,Japanese food cooked right.  PS A long Chef's Table exists. spotted it when headed to the washroom.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to eat at Nobu since I first learned about the NY location when I was in high school.  Now, my age has doubled and I still never thought I would get to try it.  My dad was here for NAB in April and in front of him, Eric R. surprised me: for my birthday we had a staycation reserved at Nobu Hotel and Nobu Restaurant!!!  I was beyond excited - supposedly we got \"preferential seating\" if we were hotel guests, but I never figured out what that meant.  The restaurant entrance is right next to the Nobu Hotel lobby, so it was easy to get dressed up and walk to the front.  We were seated immediately in the back of the restaurant, very close to another 2-top where we could easily hear the next party's conversation, so we were forced to chat with them sometimes.  Service was very slow, though our server was nice, we were surrounded by huge round tables with parties of 6 or more and it was hard for us to get his attention at all.  Eric R. had whiskey and 7, and I got the cracked basil cocktail with soju, yuzu juice, and pink peppercorns, tasty but tiny for $16.  Since this is a once-in-a-lifetime meal, we decided to order for ourselves rather than do Omakase.  The server suggested we do cold dishes, then hot, then sushi, then dessert.  We started with 2 cold dishes: yellowtail tartare with caviar, and beef new-style sashimi.  When the tartare arrived, it was doused in wasabi-soy dressing, very overpowering and not noted on the menu.  Eric was able to eat most of the top part that was not sitting in the dressing, and I ate the rest.  The server tried to convince us to order another one without sauce - no way!  The new style sashimi was amazing - thinly sliced beef topped with chive and sesame, seared by hot sesame oil accompanied by yuzu juice and soy.  It was so good that the ladies next to us then ordered it.  Our next course was hot: black cod miso and nasu (eggplant) miso.  They came together, perfectly flavored.  The cod was delicate and the eggplant skin crispy but soft inside.  Our third course, sushi, was ordered in 3 increments: toro scallion maki, nigiri: hamachi belly, salmon belly, scallop, saba with kelp, amaebi with fried head, ikura, fluke, uni, anago, big eye tuna, temaki: yellowtail jalapeno, negihama, salmon skin with avocado.  The big eye was sooo fatty and amazing.  All of it was amazing actually!  Fresh and delicate, served with tart yuzu soy.  Lastly, we ordered the banana harumaki for dessert (banana, dulce de leche in spring roll with passionfruit sauce) - it came out with a candle and Happy Birthday scripted in chocolate!  The next morning we did Nobu in-room dining for breakfast.  I had zosui (rice soup with tofu, mushroom, egg) and Eric R. had the breakfast okonomiyaki (with egg batter Osaka-style).  It was very good.  I really enjoyed my special birthday staycation meals and if I ever went back to Nobu I would sit at the sushi bar for sure!",

Imagine frying a bag of baby spinach drain nicely add a perfectly cooked snapper... crispy skin,  medium rare inside.  And how about some crispy miso and a light sauce.  Great dinner!  Excellent service!  Missed his name,  but you can't miss him....ponytail, beard, tattoos...stands out amongst all the other servers.  This guy gave us a description of each sashimi on the 14 piece chefs selection.  He made great suggestions.  You can tell he's been there for awhile.  That's a valuable employee.  Hostess booth needs an attitude overhaul! Lead person's attitude carried over to her underlings.  If first impressions are everything management needs to fix this immediately!  Never underestimate the long term affect this may have on the business. I expect a smile from someone at the hostess desk when I give my business to a higher end restaurant.  After all this isn't McDonald's.",

The Cod was perfectly tender and juicy and was cooked to perfection. I HIGHLY recommend this restaurant and I wish I could remember our server's name, because he made the dinner an experience. He was knowledgeable, patient, and seemed to have a real passion for not only food, but for Nobu as well. It was a great start to our night!",

Started out great with initial offering and then down hill from there.  Wine cork broke, not their fault but then the bottle disappeared for a long time to be decanted vs getting new bottle as promised.  Rock shrimp was not hot or crispy and soggy.  Let server and sommelier know. Then received gyoza which was forgettable and was told that they ordered that because they wanted to fill me up???????  Again expressed my displeasure with serve and he then ordered 5 sushi pieces for me which I was charged for.  Asked to talk to manager and sommelier showed up and relayed disappointed and with attitude he proceeded to explain he was sorry and I shouldn't have ate all of it.  Would have sent to back if I could have found server.  $400 ripoff!!! Never going back to any of Nobu's.  Better options in Vegas.",

It's sad when rock shrimp appetizer and mediocre cocktails are the best items in the meal. I guess this is how \"getting robbed\" feels like. Mizumi at Wynn provides better quality food and value - even for black cod dish. Wowww. To top it all - what great Japanese restaurants would charge for ponzu sauce?  Hahaha. I'm just laughing when I looked at my bill - didn't dispute the bill - just laughed. I would rather give $300 extra tip to the sushi chef at hamasaku in LA than go back to nobu again.",

Maybe we should have done the tasting menu because we picked multiple dishes from the menu, paid over $100 per person and everyone felt like we had nothing to eat. The reviewer that said something was the best bite of food he had ever had was right - everything was a bite.  We liked what we ate, there just wasn't much of it for the outrageous prices. The service started out a little overpowering, but in no way helpful.  It was like they were telling us to order items, but they didn't know why we should.  The lighting at our table was very dim so reading the menu was more like guessing. Quality of the fish was excellent, I never felt like we were eating anything less than fresh - I just didn't eat anything that stood out.",

The bills came out to about $90 per person, but I can honestly say that is 100% worth every penny. This is the type of restaurant that everyone should visit at least once in their lifetime.  I had the black miso cod and the pork belly skewers.  Every single bite completely melts in your mouth. In a single word... Umami.  The servers here also were great at pairing drinks with your order to maximize the flavor profile.  To end my meal, my server recommended the chocolate cake with green tea bento box.  I am by no means a sweet tooth. In fact, I actually do not like sweet foods... But OH MY GOD!  This was the best ending to my favorite meal ever. I can confidently say now that this is my new 'death row meal'!  I left the restaurant completely satisfied, yet wanting to return back even though I was already full.  No matter what it takes, you must come try this amazing restaurant :)",

But seriously, I'm in a restaurant for food, not something I can't eat. 1/2* for the black cod(only it's fresh and well-cooked, the sauce kills the whole dish tho) 1/2* for the receptionists and a \"server\". The receptionists have great smile. I am not even sure whether he is the serve or not. A guy served us drinks, explained the menu, took away all our dirty dishes except our glasses and helped finding someone to give us check. I assumed he is our serve until .... he couldn't give us check? so who/where our serve is? Is he just a busboy who did all the servers' job?? I'm confused.   Food? Edible.  Monkfish - dry and looks like a piece of SPAM that has been sitting in the refrigerator after it was opened. Caviar - salty only, couldn't find any hint of sea. Eggs weren't firm at all. Cut roll - it just simply made me speechless. It wasn't even roll or cut professionally. Black cod miso - looks great! Fish was fresh and really well cooked, but the sauce killed the entire dish. It was so sweet that it took me a glass of water to finish it.  I knew where I was. I didn't expect the meal would be cheap, but I expected better quality. Come on! Do better than THIS!!  I was disappointed.  NOT RECOMMENDED.",

The food on this trip was largely OK (missing something compared to other Nobu meals but I can't put my finger on it) but the experience and staff were terrible.   Long story short, after a long standing reservation, we walked into a half empty restaurant and were literally seated at the worst table in the place. After asking to move or find a more comfortable spot at one of the 20+ open tables, we ended up essentially being told no and taking a seat.   The waiter didn't help much. We're much more into the cooked side of the Nobu menu (they have a lot of non-sashimi and sushi options) and have always found a helpful waiter who guides us the right direction. This waiter had no time or desire to do so.  All and all, certainly not returning to this Nobu nor would I recommend this Nobu as a True Nobu experience. Long story longer, this Nobu also offers room service to the Caesar's hotel. Nobu should focus on quality and not over extending into non-essential business ventures.",

    "text": "Been here a few times as CES ritual. One star hands down is for their sushi menu and how nasty the quality and taste of their fish. It was so gross and after all these years, I continue hearing friends' upset and raging experience how bad their quality of all the fish is. I always forgot to remind my friends not to order anything fish related at this restaurant. And yes, they will sell you a $200 bottle of sake that tastes like water !  Four star for their teppanyaki and wagyu beef. It was a bummer that they refused to give us two seats at teppanyaki table even though I had reservation from few weeks back. I was craving for wagyu beef and been waiting all day for this meal. They said they could serve it at table too. We ordered it flamed style as that's pretty much the only decent option they offered, it was $38 an ounce vs what it says on their online menu $26 which is probably for non-ces days. We ordered 8 ounces and was very delish!! We ordered foie gras which they billed you $50 for an order. Yes it's Vegas and its Nobu that's known for the rip-off. While our server tried selling me caviar, I went for it but he was nice enough to repeat our order with price, and the small jar of three tea spoons full of sturgeon caviar cost $350!!!! I repeated myself to him 3 times and totally sounded silly. Of course I cancelled it !   Nobu is a place that is very tricky for their food and price. They raised menu price up 2x during ces or convention to balance out the business in slow season, and companies have the money to spend anyway! If you had loads of cash to spend, DO NOT ever order fish related item at this place, that said, don't even look at caviar either. Always go for cooked items such as miso black cod, beef items and so, to make the most of your meal!  They do have good selection of whiskey such as Japanese Yamazaki, Hibiki and Hakushu (not avail in the US) with reasonable price which means it's not doubled than their value . This is the reason that got me to give 3-star instead of 2!",

It's customary for servers to ask before taking your plate away. This guy must have been in a hurry.. But boy! Never have I experienced something like that at even a diner, let alone a fine fine!

I love every Nobu resto, especially I got to meet the chef himself. This was the first-ever Nobu hotel, restaurant and lounge will offer a stylish new experience of luxury and hospitality, appealing to returning Caesars Palace guests and the alike.            This gigantic space of  11,200 square foot Nobu restaurant and lounge, located in the heart of the Nobu Hotel,  offer several teppanyaki tables, sushi bar and private dining area along with a large lounge and bar boasting over 300 seats. This is massively big for my taste and probably the biggest Nobu resto ever!           Modern, chic, but too big to be cozy and attentive service. They put us away as most of my RSVP would have the word LOUD next to my name :-) So that my friends and loved ones can be loud with laughter and joy when we dine out.         The food wasn't all up to the bar. Sadly to say that Blue Ribbon offers better for the same price point. Although I think I still get more bang for my buck at other sushi places in Vegas. Even if you go to Noby at the Hard Rock Hotel, same food for 30% less in price point.    FOOD:  - Spicy Seafood Soup $18   - Shishito pepers  - Hamachi Sashimi with Jalapeno $28 - Nobu signature dish.   - Ankimo Monkfish Pate with Caviar $30 - ouch, it was 3 pieces, nothing more special but good.  - Miso glazed black cod $34 - ouch, was 1 of Nobu's signature dish, consistent!  - Lobster ceviche $34 - 4 lettuce cup ceviche, refreshing.   - Shrimp and Maine Lobster with Spicy Lemon $38  SUSHI and SASHIMI single piece:  - Abalone $10  - Hottategai $ 6 - Aji $6  - Uni $10 - Shima Aji $ 7 - Tai $9  - Kampachi $8 - Otoro $20  - Wagyu sashimi - delicious, 1 of my FAV dishes of the night!   - Hirame sashime - delicious.           Instead of sake, we opted for a few bottles of Champagne, reasonable mark up, just about 350% which is nothing compare for Vegas standard - Nicolas Feuillatte Brut Reserve Champagne, Louis Roederer \"Brut Premier\" Champagne.         We left uncertainty how we felt about ths new sushi spot. It was just an OK overall for us. Do I go out of my way to come back here again, not really, but it's still a good spot to check it out.",

First of all fish inside was cut in little pieces and covered in some sauce which is strange because when I order blue fin tuna roll I expect it to be executed as a regular tuna roll, but with blue fin tuna. The rest of the sushi and rolls were fine, but nothing was exceptional. Their drinks are served in very small glasses, but at least they are tasty. 5 star to a bar personnel. The atmosphere is also nice, relaxing, but fishy blue fin tuna at Noby is too big of a disappointment for me to return there anytime soon.",

    "text": "This was by far the worst experience I've ever had at a restaurant. I love Nobu, however I will never go back to the one at Caesar's Palace. When I approached the hostess stand I wasn't even greeted. When the hostess finally acknowledged I was standing there she looked up once with a smirk on her face and asked if we had a reservation. I said no and from there she proceeded to tell us the wait would be approximately 30-40 min. I was fine with waiting as we were walk ins and it was clear the restaurant was extremely busy. The part that I couldn't get over was how terribly rude the hostess was while taking down our information. Absolutely zero eye contact and the ugliest attitude I've ever encountered. About 25 minutes go by and a couple sits down next to us. They did not have a reservation and the reason I know this is I overheard them talking about not having one and the gentleman told the lady he was with not to worry and That he would get them a table right away. He goes back up to the hostess stand and spends a few minutes there and he was correct. Got them right in. I couldn't believe it. They had just got there, had no reservation just like us and got right in. Once that happened I went up to the hostess and asked why she sat that couple before us. She proceeded to tell me they had a reservation which was a complete lie. By this time I was upset and definitely called her out on her lie and asked that we too be seated. She was happy to argue with me and told me she hAd nothing available and that if we wanted to eat there we would have to continue to wait probably another 10-15 min. I went to sit back down then noticed a bunch of room at the sushi bar. I walked over and grabbed the first two seats and sat down. The hostess ran over and told us that we couldn't sit there and that we needed to move to the other side of the sushi bar. By now I was furious and seriously couldn't believe what I was hearing! I told her I preferred to stay right where I am and she insisted I had to move because in her words \"it's not sanitary to sit there.\" That was a first. The table wasn't even dirty and the only things that were missing were two set ups. I told her if the table was dirty then to send someone to wipe it down and I preferred to stay right where I'm at. She then told me it was against Health code and I had to literally laugh in her face because I'm sorry, that is complete and total BS! We ended up moving because all we wanted to do was eat and leave. All this girl did was be rude and argue with me from the second I arrived. It made my dining experience the worst I had ever had and I couldn't wait to just eat my food and get out of there! The hostess should be the face of the restaurant and if I were the manager of this restaurant I would definitely get rid of that girl. She clearly doesn't enjoy her job and doesn't belong in the hospitality industry. I'm glad I'm a local and from now on go to the Nobu at The Hard Rock Hotel. The staff at that location is extremely friendly and the food is actually better as well. I will NEVER go back to Nobu Caesar's again!",

If you want alcohol to accompany your dinner, order it all at once because they will be too busy doing other things than to ask you for a drink order. And then the bill....expensive but not unexpected. Do yourself a favor go to Morimoto - who always delivers!",

    "text": "In a word, this restaurant is simply fabulous. I've not been to other Nobu restaurants, but I can't imagine them being chicer than this. Multicultural waiters barking out orders in Japanese to the swift and focused sushi chefs, ultra trendy and modern decor, gorgeous breezy open space... And creative, masterfully prepared food to boot.  Not quite five stars since Nobu is actually no place for the sushi purist - I've had FAR better sake belly (my all time hands down favorite cut of fish), let alone regular sake, elsewhere - and service certainly could've been more attentive. Also I should state the obvious that you better be prepared to drop serious cash on your meal since dishes aren't served with garnishes or accompaniments (unless you don't mind eating pure protein). That said, my black cod miso was phenomenal and easily one of the best pieces of fish I've ever had (only behind the halibut at 3 Michelin star le Bernadin in NYC). The more-sweet-than-savory miso glaze enveloped the outer flesh of the fish in a perfectly caramelized crust, and yet somehow the meat was barely cooked to achieve an unbelievably juicy tenderness. It was actually so moist that the layers of flaky flesh simply slid off of one another and into puddles of juice upon the gentlest prod of the fork and dissolved onto the tongue. Not to mention the serving size was surprisingly HUGE - easily 6+ ounces.  Would def return with a big group and go all out. Def not the place to go if you're on a conservative work budget (like me).",

    "text": "I have been to Nobu before, but this was my first time at the Caesar's location in Las Vegas.  We may have ordered too simply, because I expected more Wow factor in my food.  I ordered the black miso cod and it is justifiably the most popular signature dish.  I was pleasantly surprised at the portion size as well.  The fish and chips were actually sea bass and crunchy jalapeno strips.  I find sea bass too delicate to bread and fry.   That said, my nephew enjoyed it and it was done with a lovely dash of spice and lemon.  The disappointment came with the traditional sushi rolls.  Do not bother.  Flavors were not balanced and they were completely uninspired. My vegetarian sister had the roasted vegetable plate and it was lovely if exceedingly simple.  I am an Uni fan (sea urchin) and use it to assess the quality of the seafood in most sushi restaurants.  Their Uni was wonderful, delicate and creamy (and also $10 for one).  Sometimes simplicity is all the fresh ingredients need. All in all, I would go back for the cod, and maybe try a new dish to see if I could find another favorite.  Yes, it is pricey, but most of the restaurants in Vegas are.  The service was professional and sufficiently attentive.",

This time, we did teppan. It was good but not the best teppan I've ever had. I think my favorites of the night were the sashimi yellowtail with Cilantro and jalapeno and the teppan beef. The California rolls were very fresh and good. The teppan cook was great; our waiter however, was less than excellent. Our pot was out of sauce when they brought it to us, I had to constantly ask for water and he seemed annoyed with me when I asked questions about the menu. I didn't care for their garlic rice either which is something I normally love. They add egg to theirs and you can't taste the garlic. They also didn't do tricks like most high (and even lower end places do). Not sure if we will go back the next time we are in Vegas.",

He was told that they did not have a vegan menu, but options so we were a bit hesitant to go. Who wants to pay top dollar for sub standard options? They exceeded our expectations. The server, Leopoldo was more than helpful. He pointed out everything that was vegan on the menu and told us of options that we could veganize. He was also very careful at asking specially what our dietary needs were and how strict we were when we said vegan. Despite being busy, he made sure to come over and check on us and even stopped to chat. We decided on the mushroom toban-yaki which had varieties of mushrooms I hadn't even seen before, roasted vegetables that came with 3 interesting and delicious dipping sauces, and two veggie rolls; one with everything including okra and an avocado and asparagus roll. The prices were fair, the portions were more than enough, and the atmosphere was fun.",

    "text": "Nobu at Caesar's Palace is ok.  The cooked dishes are all really good.  You can't go wrong with the Miso Cod or the Black Bean Sea Bass.  The lobster is any preparation style is quite tasty.  And it's nice because the Nobu chefs take out all of the hard work of actually getting the delicious meat out of the lobster shell for you.  You just pluck and gobble.  The only thing that I thought was really NOT good was the fried uni.  Yuck.  The sushi and sashimi is just so-so.  The servings are really chintzy.  Slices of the fish are so thin that you can see through them.  The toro is very sinewy and veiny.  Not melt-in-your-mouth awesomeness.    But the part about Nobu that I really can't stand is the pretentious attitude of the wait staff.  We were greeted with, \"Have you ever dined at Nobu before?\"  When we replied in the affirmative, we were further pushed with: \"Really?  This one?  Here in Las Vegas?\"  Like, come on, really?  Why all the faux snobbery?    You need to watch the upsell though, at Nobu.  They are notorious for it.  You order one thing, and the waiter will tell you, \"If you like THAT, then we've got THIS thing that's NOT on the menu--and you're gonna love it.\"  What they fail to tell you is that the new thing that they're trying to hawk to you as at least double the price of what you originally had planned on ordering.  HAPPENS EVERY TIME.",

We'd had a late lunch at Holsteins and wanted something a little lighter.  I had a lychee martini, which was very good. We also ended up ordering the lobster ceviche, black cod miso, and some tuna skewers, I believe. Each dish was presented by a different person, who would instruct you on the best way to enjoy the dish.  The meal was surprisingly good - just be prepared for very small portions! It was definitely not a very filling meal, and pretty expensive. Overall, though, we really enjoyed eating here!",

Our $65 sashimi platter was also a huge let down--there were probably only 8-10 pieces of sashimi. The rock cod tempura was probably the best thing of the night, and even then, I've had better at less expensive Japanese restaurants.  Nobu used to be my favorite place in NYC, so I was super excited to go to the Vegas location. Maybe it's my taste buds, but I was really disappointed this time around :(",

    "text": "Went last night for 9p dinner. We were a group of four. We were given a no e table and our server was Troy. Two of us ordered cosmopolitan Martinis and they tasted off. They swore they were tequila. The manager came back and explained they were made Nobu style and not with contreau so that was most likely the issue. They did remake them. The service was very good. Issues were with the food. The server advised of three specials but never gave prices. We ordered a tuna sashimi appetizer with truffle and watercress. It was six SMALL pieces. The cost was a crazy $80. Shame on us for not asking but shame on them for not explaining. CRAZY OVERPRICED. When we ordered the Wagyu beef tacos at $13 each Troy explained they were each one bite literally. They were. Rey good though.  We purchased the following Tiradito white fish $28 small but nice. Seriously very little fish Edamame nice size and fresh. Heck it was the only filling thing $7 A spicy tuna roll $12 a shrimp tempura roll $14 Two grey goose and sodas $12 each Four grey goose cosmopolitans at $16 each Ice tea $2 Three wagyu beef tacos $13 each One black bean cod which was a hot entree.  With a 20 percent tip our total was $408. YES FOLKS $408 and we were hungry. We ended up going back to Mandalay bay and having turkey club sandwiches at 1AM. We were lliterallyy all hungry. NEVER AGAIN! Iwill pay for quality but felt as though we were robbed without a gun. Just wrong. Remember any specials ask the price first. Sticker shock isn't the word.",

I was really excited to try another one of Matsuhisa's resturants and Nobu was a great choice for a romantic dinner with cocktails.  If you're looking for something energetic and lively, I would recommend getting reservations. I couldn't get a break in that they only had resrvations at 5:00 PM! go figure. I guess this place is the place to go right now.  However, if you sit by the bar, you'll get these wide spacious booths, very intimate lighting. Comfortable and good for conversation.   The food, if you've been to any of the other Nobu franchise is pretty much identical. If you're a fan of Uni, the tempura Uni was very fresh, prefectly battered but still sashimi inside! Genious!   The tobanyaki was also very tender and well marinated, flavored simply but nourishing. All the sushi was cut razor perfect, low grain. High quality of course.   Only downer was some of the wait staff seemed a bit spacy. Kept asking for water and additonal cocktails, and had to remind them a few times. ( Was not packed in the bar area ,,, soo... what gives?? )   Still a great evening. Good place to hit up if you don't mind throwing down some cash.",

I was in Vegas for a couple days for a friends birthday, reservation for nobu was made prior to getting to Vegas in fear that we may not be able to just walk in or schedule the day before. To start, the ambiance of this place was great. Our waiter came by and explained the menu and the nobu experience to us. Expect to be at the restaurant for at least 2 hours. We were a larger group, so we were there for 4 hours. The dishes are prepared so intricately. I ordered the miso black cod, which was my favorite dish that I tried. In addition, I order the waygu gyosza, and salmon tartare with caviar, both so very delicious. To end, I had the California roll, which I expected to be much better than any ordinary California roll, but it actually tasted like a regular California roll (they do not use imitation crab). My personal check for 4 items was $158. I love dining at one of a kind places like this, so it was well worth it for me. Will absolutely return when back in Vegas!",

We were grossed out and spit our food. We showed the waitress and she right away took our food out and tried to hush me with my hysterics. After awhile, I think it's the manager who came out and apologize. But the best she did was not charge us for our 2 drinks and the ceviche! They still expected us to pay for the rest of our meal!. We did pay, but did not leave a tip. This made us feel that they think we r just trying to scam out of the meal.  Don't get me wrong, the food is good...but cleanliness and client satisfaction is not their priority. Never to go back there again.",

His response, \"thanks for the feedback\" didn't offer to make anything right.  Next night while passing through the hotel, spoke with the GM. Also clueless, he said \"sorry you missed your event, we messed up. We should have bought you a round. If you would like a drink let me know.   Nope. You guys ruined our night. After the last number of years joining you, we won't be back. His response \"we have lots of fans, I'm sure they will take your seats\"",

    "text": "Nobu is definitely one of my favorite restaurants to get Japanese cuisine.  I've been here several times (Dinner, after hours/ Lounge hours) and each time was spectacular. Call us crazy but we went here after having a large dinner elsewhere.. we always make sure to squeeze in a \"second dinner\" when in Vegas. Why not right? They had a prix fixe type tasting menu tempting us but we were way too full from our \"first dinner\".  What I've ordered at Nobu (for two):  -Nobu's Sashimi Bar (We opted for the 4 pieces option for $45..worth it!) (Choose Three or Four of the Following): Tai Dry Miso, Yellowtail Jalapeno, Fluke Tiradito, Salmon New Style, Sashimi Salad, Albacore Umami Sashimi, Kumomoto Nobu Salsa  -Nobu 'Takumi' Burgers Truffle Aioli, Crispy Shiitake,Onion & Foie Gras $18 each (Delicious, but small, almost like a slider. However, we both thoroughly enjoyed ours.)  -Nigiri (5 pc.) Chef's Selection $30  -Sashimi Moriawase Chef's Selection (5pc) $30  -Soft Shell Crab Roll (Masago & Avocado) $16 (We added another order.. simple but good!)  -House Special Roll; Mixed Fish $17 (So simply, yet so delicious!! We ordered three orders of this roll.. Yum!)S  -Spicy Tuna Roll (Tuna, Scallions, Creamy Sauce) $12  -Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head (Ama Ebi) $8 (Had to add another order!)  -Shrimp Tempura Roll $12  -Salmon Roll $9  -Dessert - I can't remember what we had, but I know we enjoyed it even after being stuffed.  I really should start writing down what I order because I always find myself forgetting a few when I do my reviews...  Overall, the food is up to par in my honest opinion. We always get seated very quickly, the vibe is fun, the food is delicious, and the service is great. I can't wait until we go back....",

He started me off with this fresh cucumber martini was delicious! Then I wanted something light, so he recommended the yellowtail sushi with jalapeno, wasn't too spicy at all, perfect amount of flavor.  I was still a bit hungry so his last recommendation was the black miso cod, cooked perfectly! Tender, juicy and full of flavor!  Was an overall great experience, now I have to go back for dessert!",

I love plates of sashimi with sauce on it so that's mostly what I ordered  - white fish  - salmon - yellowtail - black cod  - uni - oysters - wagyu beef tataki  the dishes were amazing! very fresh and the texture was buttery and super good.  I loved all the sashimi dishes  the uni was cold and tasted really fresh. must get! $10  my other favorite fish was the salmon.  the texture was like butter and the brown sauce it came with went great with it  the white fish was also good.  the sauce was very lemony  yellowtail was great also but it's just with ponzu sauce so nothing special  the wagyu beef was also very good! it was lightly seared beef thinly cut and served cold.  I think I would prefer it served warm or hot but I guess.  they put some ponzu sauce on it  also tried a roll for the hell of it.  the waiter said the house roll was popular.  I did not like it at all.  the white wrapping it came with was good though. I like anything besides the regular seaweed wrap",

Maybe because this time I was alone, maybe because I have several visible tattoos.  Don't know.  All I do know is I have no plans on returning.  Does not matter how good the food is.  If service is bad, it is not worth it.  You mileage may vary, but if you are alone and with visible tattoos, you may not get served.",

Look at my yellowtail & Wagyu dishes, both soaked in lemon juice. Everything else is plain, All sashimi just basic & none of the plates have diping sauce.  Plain soy sauce and ginger either. bla bla which I can go anywhere.  Look at my review on Sushi Samba that's real sushi.  Each plate have the executive signature dipping sauce.

Totaling over $120 per person.  First let me start by saying I found my most favorite drink ever - which was the cucumber martini with lychee juice and grapefruit vodka.  It was so light and refreshing w a hint of sweetness.  I can't wait to try making it at home.  We ordered a bunch of cold plates to start - cucumber salad, artichoke salad, yellowfin sashimi, crab cerviche and spicy edamames.  All delicious!!    Then we had the spicy chicken skewers and the rock shrimp.  The shrimp dish was my favorite.   We ordered three desserts including the chocolate donuts and the bento box.  They were amazing but I wish they were bigger bc we all wanted more.  I have been waiting to go to Nobu in NYC for a while and am so happy I made it to the Vegas location.  Hope to go back!",

He was helpful at first but I never got my refund for the fraudulent gratuity that I was wrongly charged. I had contacted him a few times after my initial conversation with him and he always said he would look into it but never did. It has been almost 3 weeks and nothing has been resolved. It should not take more than 10 business days to do a refund transaction. I am very disappointed in my experience at this so called \"upscale\" restaurant. It is overpriced and underwhelming so don't spend your money here.",

My personal favorite was the yellow tail sashimi in ponzu sauce and jalapenos. The fish was so tender, it melted in my mouth. There's a reason Nobu is a sushi lovers mecha, but expect to spend at least $125 a person.",

    "text": "Nobu was nogood. The vegetarian fare was far from flavorful. Tobanyaki tofu was basically strips of tofu (unfried) in what looked like butter and soy sauce (was on the edge of being fat-grossed out). Todu itself having no flavor, the dish was unimaginative to say the least.  The vegetarian sushi was tasteless, textureless. Maybe i am not a sushi connoisseur but local stores, whole foods, trader joes, have better tasting veggie sushi.  Kushiyaki with vegetables with a peruvian or chilean i cant remember was very good. Finally something with flavor.  As i have come to notice, nonindian chefs dont understand vegetarian foods are not like meat, seafood where the meats have their own flavors and spicing them actually detracts from intended flavors. Vegetables really need additional help with spices. Even some salt in the sushi would have made it better.  It is a dimly lit place where you struggle to read the menu. And all of the above nearly rocked $60. Waiter was pretty good.",

The food at this particular locations falls a bit short, relatively speaking of course as compared to the other Malibu location. The rolls/sashimi lacked a bit of the wow factor that you've grown to love from a Nobu. I mean the presentation is great, but the taste is just meh...

A take on Japanese-Peruvian fusion, Nobu delighted our palettes with a unique succession of small plates, including King Crab Ceviche, Black Cod miso, and Wagyu Beef, which was aesthetically set ablaze upon black rocks.   To put it candidly, Nobu was one of the best overall dining experiences that I have ever been a part of. The quality of food, staff, and ambience is simply unmatched in the city of Las Vegas.",

Bottom line: best part are the cocktails, appetizers, and small dishes- very unique. Sushi rolls nothing to brag about. Priced very high.  Drink menu unique with lots to choose from, we got some cocktails with a sake base to try something different and they did not disappoint.  For food: mixed ceviche was our favorite dish, different than the usual diced up kind you get elsewhere. Yellowtail and jalapeno was good and we got it bc was highly recommended, but seems a little over-hyped and also had a ton of soy sauce. Shrimp lobster hot dish was great, my wife really enjoyed it, good amount of seafood. As for sushi, we got the spicy tuna and chef roll (similar to rainbow roll)- they were good but definitely nothing extraordinary that you would expect.  Worth the experience but we eat a lot of sushi and this place is not near the top of sushi places we have been.",

Everything from the service to the ambience to the presentation to he food is exceptional. What made our experience exponentially amazing: our servers knowledge of food. He asked one simple question to everyone on the table: tell me what you like eating and what you def don't want on your table and I ll help decide the nights menu. My husband who is a vegetarian was served beyond tasty and exceptional food at a Japanese restaurant. That deserves brownie points. He normally does not enjoy eggplant but gobbled down their egg plant dish: it was so yum.  We started with a yellow tail starter which just melted in our mouths. Their bite sized tacos, their main course preparations, every single thing is a piece of art and a treat to your palate. Heavy on the pocket but so worth it!

Been wanting to try a restaurant owned by Chef Nobu for a long time and just had to give it a go when I stumbled upon \"Nobu\" at the Caesars Palace.  The menu has hot and cold fare priced from $10+ with a big list of sushi and sashimi to choose from. The nigiri do not come in pairs. Sushi is ordered by the piece and it ranges from $5 to $90. At the same time there are also sushi rolls and hand rolls as options.  The Alaskan black cod miso $34 was seasoned nicely and grilled to perfection. It came with a beautiful stalk of pickled ginger root which the sushi chef pointed it out that the tip was edible.  I ended up eating the whole stalk because it tasted really good.  There are sushi bar or the lounge bar to choose from if dining alone.   I think the fact that this restaurant is located in Caesars Palace in Las Vegas made it quite high-profile and at the same time allowing them to command the steep prices.  There's no way to leave this place feeling satisfied without spending at least $100 per person.",

It takes a lot at this point to really get us excited about a newly visited place. Overall, this restaurant was a huge hit. Service perfect, food amazing! We dined out for my brother's birthday & tappanyaki is his favorite, so we reserved one of the few tappan tables. Started with all different cocktails from their specialty menu, I had the martini w/ lycee, very good. Appetizer - Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalepeno - I wish we had ordered more! Of the 4 choices of pre-set menus, varying greatly in price, we all ordered the menu w/ scallops and wagu beef. Overall, the full menu was great, but the beef was so good, so perfectly cooked, we ordered another round of it. The chef less than half-way though the dinner asked us if we'd like him to slow down a bit (I do admit, we talk a lot and take our time eating), which was very much appreciated. Loved the experience, though obviously expensive. We plan on returning soon. Thanks to all for making my brothers birthday ridiculously enjoyable!",

    "text": "Five star service with three star food...overall, I am still a fan. Heather provided some of the best service we have ever had...even though we basically closed the place, she cheerfully took the time to answer all our questions, provided amazingly attentive service, didn't rush us, and pretty much made our day. We didn't even order any booze.  We had the $125 omakase dinner...Heather arranged it so that one of the courses would be the Wagyu course (ordinarily $38!!! an ounce). The food was for the most part OK...I guess I can't really taste the difference between regular neighborhood sushi and that from fish that flew first class from Japan in a Louis Vuitton tank, and presumably was massaged, fed first growth Bordeuxs and truffles and foie gras. I mean, holy moly, that sushi was expensive! And, it must be said, one course was probably the least plesant thing I have ever put in my mouth...I'll pause here to let that sink in a minute. The halibut sashimi had raw okra...wow...who was the genius that decided to use raw okra??? Have they ever tasted that??? One bite and I could feel my mouth fill with mucous (from the mucin in the okra)...the more I chewed the more mucous was produced...ugggh. It felt like some hocked a loogie in my mouth. I literally could not swallow this...I had to take a big swig of water just to get it down my throat. Whew!  After surviving this, we were served Nobu's signature Miso Roasted Black Cod...this was the first time I had tasted this iconic dish, though I have had plenty of imitators. I actually felt that it was undercooked, as it was still translucent, and a touch too sweet. The biggest disappointment was that my \"fillet\" was loaded with bones. The second disappointment was that about one minute after the cod came out, they brought out the wagyu tataki. Since this was basically the price of gold and was cooking its way to oblivion on the hot stones, we had to switch our attention to the beef. Now this was amazing...having never had True Japanese Wagyu before, I was surprised at how much it tasted like foie gras...literally melting in my mouth. Now THIS was well worth the cost.  The miso soup tasted like, well, miso soup. The desert had green tea ice cream and a bitter chocolate cake...it was kind of...gross.  The shock we received was when we received our check...Heather had comp'd our Wagyu. She explained that she had noticed that I had picked aside a lot of bones in my cod, and that my wife didn't even have a chance to eat much of hers because the Wagyu was brought out too early. We hadn't even mentioned anything, but Heather had noticed and taken care of it. Wow...I was speechless. This was going above and beyond.  Overall, I  found the decor and setting to be wonderfully elegant, in a Japanese minimalist sort of way. What was surprising was that the service was not stuffy or pompous in any way. In a way, this was the best \"bargain\" of our trip!",

    "text": "I've been dreading this review I'm about to give..  Looking back on the experience, I probably shouldn't go to Japanese restaurants to be turned on, or blown away. My climax with sushi was 3-4 years ago, now I get bored with it. I'm more of a NEW American/French food lover.    First off, the server wasn't very informative, so I talked to another server passing by, she actually gave me some good guidance. We ordered a wide range of items, going off their recommendations. We started with sashimi yellowtail with jalapenos. Of course it was good, Yuzu makes anything rock, and fresh raw fish does it's job well, no help needed. Second was the lobster ceviche. I found it boring, uninspired, bland. Sorry.   Third was the new style sashimi, salmon. This was by far the best. Slightly cooked, warm sesame, miso sauce. Delish.  Main courses were the black cod miso,a restaurant favorite, but not my favorite. I just kinda ate it, without having any real feelings for it. I was just thinking ok, maybe the next plate will be better. Creamy spicy rock shrimp tempura, I had two pieces and decided it was time to order a freakin sushi roll and call it quits. I'm hungry and not so impressed. Thank god I wasn't paying.  I ordered the nobu roll I believe, it had ahi tuna, yellowtail, avocado, scallion, masago.  I didn't think I'd have to get a roll to be happy and satisfied, oh well..   My only recommendation,  the new style sashimi.",

Been to many Nobu's (Hawaii, Hollywood, Malibu, Hard Rock Hotel) and must say this one in the Caesar's Hotel is the best by far. It's amazing that although they all have the same menu, the food quality and service is different at each location (fyi the Hollywood Nobu is horrible on all levels). My husband have become regulars at this particular one because it is just that good. We chose to sit in the lounge area because the booths are comfy and has a cheerful vibe.  My husband actually insisted I write this review because the manager Bryan Shinohara is so awesome and recognizes the regulars, such as us, and goes out of his way to make us feel welcome and appreciated. He is an important factor that makes us want to come back time and time again.",

We tried a few new dishes and some of the old ones like spicy tuna on crispy rice and the regular nigiri.  Some of the new dishes that we tried were the soft shell crab roll, king crab ceviche, white fish sashimi special and king crab tacos.  The tacos I didn't love as much, but the rest of the dishes were amazing! I would come here over and over again! Also the cucumber martinis are my favorite! A must try!",

On the corner in front of Bally's are impersonators...Zach Galfanikis holding a baby, Gene Simmons in his Kiss getup, and a life-sized Hello Kitty. I want to punch them all. All hope is gone.  I need an 18 year old, some vicodin, and respite from this madness. Eighteen year-old Scotch, that is.   I wander over to Caeser's sports book to kill time before the Preakness, but the glassware people are everywhere. I duck into the nearest restaurant hoping to find solace from these curious assholes. And there it was. A sanctuary in the midst of it all...Nobu's at Ceaser's.  The server was a nice young man who resembled that creepy shit from American Pie...the one desperate to abduct Tara Reid's panties on prom night.  That's all I kept thinking about throughout lunch.  My prom.  Well, that and Becky Deluca's sudden onset of virtue, not Tara's panties.  Five Asahi drafts and one ceviche later, I was prepared to face the madness once again. The bill was close to a Franklin, but I wasn't bothered. The ceviche was a visual extravaganza, its flavor and texture even better. The draft Asahi was nothing short of nectar, a gift from the barley gods. And the server? While creeping me out, he was more attentive than a black man at a Klan rally.  Becky must be in her mid forties by now. Probably wearing those giant, white cotton panties and mom jeans. I bet she and her husband sport colored glassware when they hit the mean streets of Vegas.  Nobu's Ceaser helped me find center when I needed it most. Mylute paid $5.20 to show. I had $200 across the board on him. Be wary of the bong people when in Vegas. Fuck you Becky.",

However, be prepared to spend at least $100-200 per person. At the very least. Regardless, I keep coming back.   What to order: The signature tasting menu is the best deal at $125 and has more mainstream appeal and tastier options IMO than the daily special for $175, which is for the ultra adventurous aka eating a whole river crab in one bite - shell, claws, eyes and all. Next time I go I'm going to have the waiter help me pick my own custom tasting menu. I think that's the play because you'll get everything you like and nothing you don't like.

I don't feel like I usually wait that long for appetizers in other restaurants that are of the same caliber. Food was good but nothing spectacular. I'd say Gary Danko in SF is better even though they serve different cuisines. I love Japanese food, I've been to Japan three times so I think I know what fresh sashimi is. And Nobu doesn't really compare. My biggest issue with the restaurant was the rude hostess telling me she \"needs the table back by 7:30\" and it was 5:19 when they sat us. I've never been asked such a thing ever. Not even at Olive Garden. Seriously?",

The miso black cod is a wonderful dish.  The fish is fattier/oiler than I expected, but delicious none the less.  The crispy rice with spicy tuna is out of this world.  So delicious we wanted to order another plate.  I also loved the tuna and jalapeno roll.  I wanted seconds on that as well.  I washed it all down with a ginger caipirinha, phenomenal.  The ambiance here is fantastic.  The staff are very attentive but don't hover over you.    All in all, this is a fantastic dining experience.",

Ordered rock shrimp tempura from the kitchen and it never came out until after 40 minutes of just waiting and asking for it from server. Sushi chefs were also asking about it for several times. Server finally gave the food to us when we asked for the check and said he did not want to throw it away so he said we can eat it. Just waited for the check and left it.

The fish was fresh and delicious, rolls were well balanced and prepared. The service on our first visit certainly left something (okay, a lot) to be desired, however.   Our second visit was better, with a server who was knowledgeable and friendly. Again, high quality, fresh fish, and some great creative rolls. The price is certainly up there, but not the most expensive place for sushi on the strip. We look forward to going back again and trying omakase (chef's choice) - seems to be the best option!",

I was with a party of 8 and I simply got outvoted (even though it was my birthday weekend, funny how that worked now that I think about it...)  Anyways, here were my MAJOR issues (not enough time or space to list them all):  -I found our waitress to be very aloof, verging on unfriendly.  -RIDICULOUSLY overpriced!...and I've been to Atlantis, so overpriced food does not scare me, but I expect it to at least be decent. -I had to limit my dining choices to non-fish entrees, which was not easy, but I did manage to find some things.... --Tempura asparagus...they brought it out to me and there were TWO PIECES ON MY PLATE!!!!! OMFG, TWO, 2, DOS? Seriously?! I was done right there, but no, I had to keep going. My friend that was with me owns a fine dining catering company and worked at The Ritz, so I know when even HE says something is a rip off, it's BAD. In fact, our table was going on and on about it SO much that I think they must have overheard us, because they didn't charge me for it. --Next, I ordered 2 Wagyu tacos. Now, she told me they were small. Okay, cool, I'm thinking like street taco size-ish. I am NOT being hyperbolic when I say they were the SIZE OF MY PINKY FINGER!!!!!!! I held it up against my finger to take a photo of it!!! And the best part...THIRTEEN DOLLARS EACH!!!!!!!! And you had to order a minimum of 2. --By this time, you would like I'd just stop eating and cut my losses, but no. I ordered a chicken kabob and a steak kabob. The chicken was overcooked and dry and the steak was so UNDER cooked that I think I heard it moo...blood was oozing. Gross.  --Their beers were TINY and $10 each. Ouch.   Okay, now wanting to be fair, here are my husband's thoughts...a sushi pro:  -Overpriced, but expected. -4 of the other people in our group gave a \"price point\" of $75 a person and said, serve whatever you want to us...he liked that. -Their \"signature\" dish of black cod with miso was very delicious & succulent, everything else was \"fine\" -Annoying that it was being split between 4 people and they continuously gave portions of 5 or 6. Either give 4 or 8! How hard is that?!...it was like they wanted to start a brawl.  -Wouldn't need to return, but don't regret going.  That about sums it up.",

    "text": "Had a great meal at Nobu! It was nice to get away from all the steaks and heavier foods for a night.  Everything was so fresh and proof of good quality ingredients being used was obvious when we saw and tasted the food. Also, the portions were surprisingly generous as well!  We didn't have too much for dinner as we were stuffed from previous meals.   My mom started with their clear mushroom broth (I'm sure it has a much fancier name but that's essentially what it was). As plain as it seemed, she said it had a good balance of flavour in it and obviously did not have any hint of MSG in it. I started with the shrimp tempura. Nothing amazing, expensive for what two pieces but I guess eating at Nobu I shouldn't be surprised.  For our main course, we had to try the signature Miso Black Cod. I can't stress how beautiful a cut they serve. It was BEAUTIFUL. That cut alone wouldn't be cheap if you bought it to make it at home yourself. They cook it so beautifully that all the juices stay in the fish until you cut into it and put it in your mouth. The only thing I was a little sad about was because the cut is so thick, it should've been marinated longer so the entire fish would have been flavoured all the way through. No biggie. The top of the fish was amazing.   I suggest maybe getting a bowl of rice or having a few other small dishes with it because it's very rich if you try to eat it on its own and finish an order to yourself.  Definitely worth going to try. Beware slow service.",

    "text": "Now I understand why so many people are so crazy about Nobu. What a dining experience!   I'm not just talking about the food. I mean, if a restaurant has 20 something locations all over the world, it's a sure proof that the food is there. I was more impressed by my experience overall. Impeccable service along with unique ambiance, dining at Nobu will open your eyes to a whole another world of fine dining.  As soon as you walk into the restaurant, sole size of the restaurant itself will surprise you. Then, you'll be awed by origami decorations above the hostess stand, or stylish lounge areas of the restaurant. Ambiance of this restaurant is very unique. It's not as uptight as other fine dining restaurants, but just luxurious enough to impress.   We started with some cocktails (two of us), yamazaki sidecar for me and champagne 95 for her. Both drinks were strong, which is perfect! more the merrier :) both cocktails were excellent.  We had shishito peppers to start with, and they were perfect appetizers. Fried crispy and with a spicy kick, they certainly had our appetites going. We had shrimp kushiyaki (skewers) in anticucho sauce, and they were delicious! Anticucho, as explained by our server, is Peruvian chili that Chef Nobu began to use for his cooking back in his days in Peru. It had very unique flavors, and we both loved it. Next item on agenda was Nobu's famous black cod miso, which was outstanding! I'm usually not a big fan of broiled fish, but miso-glazed black cod certainly changed my perspective on that. In To top it all off, we had beef tobanyaki, which is beef tenderloin cooked in a stone pot with mixed mushrooms and vegetables. This was certainly the highlight of the meal, as tenderloin was cooked so perfectly and sauces used complemented the tenderloin so well.  I can say dining at Nobu was one of the best dining experiences I've ever had. I'll certainly be back.",

This restaurant is ENORMOUS and thus is pretty cavernous on a weekday night at 9pm, which is when we went. As a two-top we were made to wait for 20 minutes at the bar for a lounge table even though the lounge area was only half full and the table at which we were eventually seated was open when we walked in. Meh.  We ordered the omakase (125 bones for the \"Chef's Selection\" version - there's a longer tasting menu for 175). The first four courses were all sashimi salads. In order: tuna with yuzu soy sauce, seared salmon belly with miso crumble and yuzu soy sauce, hamachi with cilantro, jalapeno and yuzu citrus glaze, sea bass with miso, crispy garlic and yuzu olive oil. ALL YUZU EVERYTHING. The fish was very high quality, but by the fourth course I think my citrus taste buds had punched in their overtime and gone home. Meh.  A waiter then brought us a fine-looking plate of tuna sashimi, which our server had to unceremoniously repossess a few minutes later, as it was not part of the omakase and delivered by mistake. We were told that a sushi plate was to follow later. Meh.  The fifth and sixth courses were the Nobu signature miso-glazed sea bass with grilled asparagus, which was excellent, and a definitely not-medium-rare steak teppanyaki with enoki mushrooms, which was just okay - \"meh\" if you will.   The seventh course was puzzling, a bowl of jalapeno-mayonnaise glazed rock shrimp that appeared like an appetizer pulling up fashionably late to the meal progression. We didn't finish it.  The promised sushi plate arrived as the eighth course, in the form of spicy tuna rolls. MEEEHHH.  Fortunately the dessert was great. Flourless molten chocolate cake, fresh fruit and four flavors of mochi ice cream. It was uniformly awesome.  250 for dinner for two before tax, tip and drinks is not outlandish in Vegas but no one could or should call you snobby for expecting more out of a restaurant that looks this impressive and bears the Nobu brand name.  #meh",

Anyone who thinks their sushi is good, hasn't had real sushi. Now that the cons section is over, let me explain why they're getting 4 stars from me.  The black cod is delish. It was probably the best cod I've had. I never thought cod could be so good (actually fish n chips are pretty good too lol). If I had ordered a bowl of rice on the side, this would have been pretty filling for $38.  The Japanese wagyu was everything I had hoped it to be and then some. The sauce was great. It was super tender and although some pieces were a bit more marbled than I would have liked, it was very memorable overall. 6 oz at $38/oz is a steep price..  but if you're going to Nobu, you're willing to splurge anyways right? Might as well go all out.  The yellowtail to me was good, but I'm not a big yellowtail person. I could live without ordering this again. Now I'm off to the bento box dessert. I'm sure that'll be good.",

Nothing was terrible, but not everything was up to the Nobu standard I expected.  The good: cucumber martini was easily one of the best cocktails I've ever had. Their creative mixing of lychee with cucumber really set this drink apart. Yuzu yellowtail appetizer was also very good and fresh, and their handroll (yellowtail with green onion) and house special cut roll were not only delicious, but reasonably good values for the price. Dessert (fried banana with passion fruit reduction and mango shichimi ice cream) was overpriced but a very creative and delicious dessert.  The bad: lobster with shrimp entree turned out to be stir fried mushrooms with just a tiny bit of actual seafood. That in itself wouldn't have been awful, but the sauce didn't actually even taste great: too tart without much other flavor. Lobster tacos were also a huge miss: the lobster had been fragmented and stir fried with so many other remnants that I couldn't even tell I was eating lobster. It was also ridiculous that I paid $9 for a \"taco,\" which was basically a tiny single bite sized morsel of mystery meat with a wonton skin shell.  I expect and am prepared to hemorrhage money when I go to Nobu, but I also expect a phenomenal dining experience in exchange. This was overall acceptable but far from phenomenal, and definitely not worth it for me to come back and drop over $100 per person on a merely acceptable experience.",

With locations all over the world that are frequented by celebrities, they obviously know what they're doing are, able to consistently provide a luxurious experience for guests, and have been able to scale that experience well.   My girlfriend and I were finishing up a road trip with one night in Vegas, and after showing me Drake's instagram, convinced me that Nobu would be the place to try.   She was right. To end our trip we got dressed up and showed up to the beautiful restaurant inside Caesar's. Amazing decor, everyone dressed to the nines, and five star service from start to finish.  We got two drinks each, and then split about 5 different dishes to share. I absolutely love seafood, so I was surprised that one of my favorite dishes of the night was the seared tofu skewers in a spicy chili sauce.  We ordered two rolls; the salmon and California if remember correctly. They were good but nothing to write home about. We also had the delicious shishito peppers.  The absolute best thing I ate that night was the Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu. It was simple, elegantly plated, barely seared, and resting in a light soy based sauce. It essentially melted in my mouth and immediately made me feel connected to the ocean, like they some how pulled this fish straight out of the water before they brought it to our table. If you're a lover of raw/fresh seafood you'll know what I mean.  I figured we'd spend about $100 a person, and that was almost exactly how it worked out. I think it was about $225 with tip.   All in all it was a great experience and the majority of the food was incredible.",

Word of caution though, make sure you have at least two and a half hours to make it through the whole course. We talked to the waiter and thought we would make a 10pm show (starting dinner at 8pm), but that ended up in a whole lot of anxiety at the end and we also had to skip the soup course (#8). That being said, on to the good stuff. After every dish my wife and I were saying.. \"dude, that was awesome\". And unfortunately, yes, I do say \"dude\" too much. But dude (and I mean that in a gender-less way), it was awesome.  Sushi was good, mini toro tower (chopped toro with garlic and shallots) was amazing, miso fish was flavor packed, on and on from dish to dish it was surprising and great.  But notice I didn't say cheap... don't even go here if you have to think about the price. But worth every penny. Highly recommend the Mango Passion cocktail, my wife really liked it and she's pretty hard to please with drinks.",

For our main we had The Black Cod Miso and Sea Bass with a side of rice.......both of the fishes were tender, flavorful and succulent.  For dessert We had The Whiskey??? (Sorry can't remember the full name) would of loved that served in a different container   so to of been able to enjoy all the layers at the same time.  Note, stick to the cocktail menu, for cocktails, the bar staff were not trained  to conjure up cocktails of there own",

    "text": "You definitely pay for the experience here, not the food. Compared to hotels, this is the W of sushi restaurants - super hip, ambiance is amazing, food is ok. We dined on a Sun. night, and the restaurant was packed. Our server was knowledgeable and professional, but forgot a couple requests/orders throughout the meal.  Also, servers need to understand how to cater to authentic Asian palettes - every suggestion our server made was really Americanized, we didn't like anything we got based on his suggestions.  We started with some apps: - Famed jalapeno yellowtail (yellowtail was great, the jalapeno was not spicy at all) - Rock shrimp tempura (we only got this at the suggestion of our server as the 'best tempura' choice. We originally wanted to order shrimp + veggie tempura.  This is NOT tempura.  It's basically bang bang shrimp) - Chutoro carpaccio (off menu item suggested by server. Pretty good flavors throughout. Capers, truffle oil, etc.)  Main: - Sashimi: yellowtail, yellowtail belly, oh toro, clam, red snapper, uni, salmon belly (bellys were very good, uni super fresh. Have had better oh toro for sure. Most were fresh, clam was flat out disgusting) - Rolls: house roll + soft shell crab roll (both very good. They wrap their rolls in a very thin layer of radish - nice concept. Gives a little more contrast in bite)  Dessert: - Bento box (probably best part of the meal. Matcha ice cream is very matcha!)  Drinks: - 10-year sake (decent) - White wine (basic) - Old Fashioned (at suggestion of server, really wasn't that great. Should have just gotten straight whisky)  Basically, if you're looking for a dining experience, Nobu is great. But I wouldn't come again to pay this much for the food quality - would definitely go elsewhere.",

    "text": "We had dinner here last night.  We spent about $1500-$2000 for 4 adults with Sake.  Our waiter was fantastic and well versed in the menu.  The idea of eating sushi second after several more substantial plates is interesting and novel to me but not the worst idea.   We had 7-8 dishes brought out and served family style followed by 4-5 pieces of sushi including one roll.  The problem was that none of the food was substantial.  Everything was delicious. The fish was fresh and well prepared and the accompaniments and sauces were balanced and really quite good.  Aside from the occasional notes of sugar in the sauce this was practically Keto up until the sushi.  No fried rice, dumplings, etc.  Maybe that was an oversight on our waiter for not recognizing.  I could have eaten for 8 hours (and easily have spent $4k) before getting remotely full.   The sushi is good. It is not earth shatteringly awesome or a work of art.  It's just good sushi.  No better than your local place back home (and if it is not, you need a new place back at home).  The fried crab legs were just ok. The Tuna with truffles was the hit of the night.  Also try the live scallop.  All that being said, food quality is above average for Vegas.  Waiter was what you expect at this price point.  Probably a great date night restaurant.  Just don't go hungry.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I were doing well in the casinos so we decided to treat ourselves to dinner at Nobu! Each of us had been once before at home in Waikiki.   We had no reservations because they were booked, but we were able to walk in and be seated immediately at the Sushi bar.   We decided on the most expensive Omakase (chef's choice) meal. There were  some options for Omakase. You could choose between a pre selected menu by Nobu for $125/pp or the literal Chef's choice for $225/pp. We opted for the $225.   Of course we started with drinks! I chose the Pinot Grigio (they only offer one and it is an Italian wine at $14/glass). My bf opted for the Peanut Bourbon and Jelly which he describes as smooth and slightly sweet.   I can't quite remember every single item we were served but, I took pictures of every course and will try my best to title them respectively!   There were about 6 courses that ranged from 2 pieces to several mini dishes within the course. They also included an ocean salad dish, a foie gras miso soup and dessert. The variety of fish I can rememer we were served were: otoro, Japanese baracuda, and akamutsu. There were different cuts of different grades of fish so there were definitely more than just 3 types. In addition to the salad, soup and several sushi courses we had: Japanese oysters, Maine lobster, and Wagyu (grade 5?).   Although they ask us at the start of the meal if we are on any time constraints, our only gripe was that the time between courses was very long. Our meal lasted about 2.5 hours. We think it was bc we chose the literal Chef's choice not the pre selected chef's choice.  Service was excellent, each time we left the table they refolded our napkins and they were constantly clearing our finished plates and wiping our area clean for the next course. The sushi bar didn't seem like that tight of a squeeze until the woman seated next to me kept bumping me with her purse, elbows, and arms as she spoke very animated with arm gestures. We were able to scoot away from her because there were some empty seats to our right.    All in all, it was my first time trying Omakase and I was completely satisfied. I'd definitely shell out the cash to do it again for a special occasion!",

I definitely recommend reservations.   After being seated, we waited an unusual amount of time for the drink and dinner menus. Finally, our server comes to the table to drop off ONE drink menu for 4 people and hurriedly walks away. We had a 9:30 show to get to, so already I'm thinking we need to pick up the pace. 10 minutes go by and we finally get the dinner menu. ONE dinner menu. Had to ask for another one. Like I said, I've been to other Nobu locations and the service here was f'n weird.   Our server then asks if we've been to that location before. My husband and I stated we've been to other Nobu's and our server goes on a 5 minute rant about how this location is totally different from other ones and don't expect the same experience. It came off in a very condescending way, almost like he was berating us. Side note: the menu and dinner presentation was the same as the other locations, so not sure why he said it was  different.   The Food: I always get the same thing. Creamy Spicy Rock Shrimp was good, but smaller portion compared to other times I have had it. Miso Black Cod was also delicious and melted in my mouth. Only bad thing is it will set you back $37. Bento Box dessert was also not as good as the other locations. I guess my expectations were too high. I also like to get their seasonal cocktails. This time it was the Buddhas Passion, with apricot sake, vodka, lemon and passion tea-- very refreshing!   Overall, this dining experience was okay. I definitely prefer other locations.",

The restaurant breathes energy with its modern interior, hip crowd, and electronic music.  As the restaurant is available at limited locations in the US and international markets, we always make it a point to reserve an evening for this location when visit Vegas.  The experience comes at a cost if you plan on trying out most of the well known dishes.    By far our favorite dish and the most signature dish here is the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - it is a spicy twist on your typical sashimi. We also tried the new style salmon sashimi which was a great flavor profile between the fatty salmon and the rich sauce.  The lobster ceviche was also really good.  For the hot appetizers, I recommend the rock shrimp tempura with the creamy sauce.  You also cannot go wrong with the chicken yakatori - not that much different than your typical Japanese restaurant but well done.    For hot entrees, we ordered the spicy prawns - very good however our favorite has to be the staple Japanese dish the miso cod.  Flavor was great and the fish just melts in your mouth.  Paired the hot dishes with the a stir fried vegetables and squid.    Wrapped up the meal with a sushi and sashimi selection.  Personally, would not recommend over investing in the sushi and sashimi as the cold and hot appetizers really differentiate this from other Japanese establishments. Very well executed and was super fresh, but would rather spend the money on other dishes.  Good place to start out your night and convenient at the center of the strip. Pricey but you can't go wrong.  Will be back.",

    "text": "Nobu is one of my favorite chain restaurants and most of the locations that I've dined in throughout the country have typically exceeded my expectations. Nestled at Caesar's Palace (with their own Nobu hotel and suite close by), reservations are recommended and there are different dining areas such as the sushi bar, tables, and teppanyaki table with a full menu at each area.  We went the a la carte options instead of the omakase and I wasn't disappointed with the portions as they were large and I left with a stuffed belly. The all star dishes of the evening were the black cod miso (my personal favorite that's offered at all of the locations!), yellowtail salmon with jalapenos, salmon \"new style\" sashimi, scallop with truffle butter, and wagyu gyoza. However, if you have never dined at Nobu before, I would highly recommend trying the omakase so you can get to try a little bit of everything.  The service was exceptional during our meal. Our waters were consistently refilled, our dishes and utensils were picked up and replaced with fresh ones, and our drink suggestions were on point.",

The restaurant was buzzing even at the later hour and the overall environment invites an upscale sushi experience with some fun.    Service started out strong as we ordered some dishes right away given the late hour.  Signature jalapeno yellowtail sashimi and toro scallion rolls got us going... edamame two ways, salted and spicy, followed.  Spicy tempura rock shrimp and their well known miso black cod were our cooked selections.  Salmon and whitefish sashimi in a ponzu sauce, spicy tuna rolls, yellowtail and scallion rolls, eel and yellowtail belly nigiri rounded out the seafood feast.    The food was exceptional.  Nobu's standards for incredible food and presentation are top notch.  The service... strong to start but floundered (no pun intended) at the end. Empty water glasses and the elusive check extended the night a bit longer than we hoped.",

But everyone shares so there's something for everyone.   The yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno is rightly one of their best sellers. Just sublime. We also loved the shishito peppers.   And then the sushi rolls. It's hard to describe how much better it tasted than the normal sushi we order.  Is it the fish? Probably. Just great quality.  And then we got the black cod miso which melted in your mouth it was so smooth. And we also enjoyed a vegetable with garlic sauce. Get it.   Meal ended with dessert and they decorated it for our friend's birthday. Yum.   Drinks were on point; service was always on.   Truly perfection. Just bring your credit card. Or two of them.

My husband and I were trying to go to the buffet at the Cesars palace but the line was extremely long. So we decided to go to Nobu!  We were greeted and seated right away! As we were walking to our table I can see everyone had really small plates (nervous at this moment) I love love to eat lol... so we began to look at the menu and prices were mind blowing. But I thought hey it's Nobu (celebrity hangout in LA). Our waiter Tyler came over and explained the menu answered any questions we had. Tyler made this one of the best experiences ever. I've never had a waiter go into soo much detail and passion into food as he did. We would hear other waiters around us and none came close to Tyler.   Food was amazing. Wagyu tacos were amazing $15/ a bite size taco but best bite of my life! Lobster taco not soo much needs more flavor but I guess the chef wants you to taste the freshness of the lobster. Tempura roll was simple but fresh. Lobster was amazing! Steak exceptional. Bill not soo much lol but would love to try the chefs premium dishes next time",

    "text": "Nobu is a sleek and trendy restaurant that's been around for a while, serving up Japanese-Peruvian entrees, various tasting menus, sushi and sashimi, and even teppanyaki  in private rooms in the back. We came here for dinner, figuring that a Japanese tasting menu would be great for a seafood-centric meal that was not overly filling, especially since we had a 9pm show to attend!  Verdict: 5 stars!  You'll definitely find stuff to love from both tasting menus, especially if you love seafood!  LOCATION:  Its near the main entrance of Caesar's - just a few steps down from Cleopatra's barge.  AMBIANCE: Dark, intimate, and sleek.  Most of the waitstaff here look young, fit, and could probably work as runway models.  They sat us down on a table with a nice, comfy red loveseat.  MENU: I recommend getting the tasting menus, 9-courses of cold and hot entrees with dessert.  The regular menu is about $150 and has many of the on-menu, classic dishes including Nobu's famous miso black cod.  The pricier menu at $225 or so has dishes with premium ingredients and off-menu specialties.  We got one of each so we could share 18 different courses total!  HIGHLIGHTS:  1. Yes that miso black cod is awesome and lives up to the hype. Thick, generous portions and super moist and soft.  It had plenty of sweet-salty flavor already, so no need to dip in more sauce.  Its a rich dish however.  Surprisingly, I would up liking the Chilean Seabass (from the $225 menu) even better - equally soft texture but flavors were more balanced with umami with that seaweed-ponzu sauce.   2. Wife loved the tuna tartare with caviar the most among the cold dishes.  For me, I am a nigiri fan and all the pieces at Nobu were perfect.  Fresh fish toppings, seasoned loosely-packed rice at the proper temperature.  Even the humble tamago was elevated here - fluffy, sweet, and includes Nobu branding!  3. The beef dishes were both good, but surprisingly I did not enjoy the A5 Wagyu on buckwheat as much as my wife did.  A bit too soft and mushy for me.  The beef entree on the regular menu had more texture, robust beefy flavors, and lots of umami with the sizzling enoki and shiitake mushrooms.  4. Nobu likes to include lots of shellfish as well.  The shrimp tempura was excellent, along with the shrimp sashimi dishes.  Lobster soup topped with miso was definitely an upgrade over the plain miso which was a minor letdown for my final dish.  They also had this King-King sized grilled shrimp from Skull Island that was a bit hard to shell, but once we succeeded we found the meat succulent.  5. The desserts and chocolate gifts at the end of meal were all great.  The bento box had traditional green tea ice cream and a chocolate lava cake. However the winner was this cream-topped buckwheat cookie-like thing with very unique, interesting flavors of sweet, tart, and salty with the addition of caviar.  It's hard to describe but reminds me of something you might find at 3-Michelin Benu in SF.  Plan on 1.5-2 hours here if you go with either or both tasting menus.  We had an awesome dinner and had plenty of time to digest and rest before our 9pm show.",

The service was outstanding and the food preparations were outstanding. I really didn't read the menu as I simply told the sushi chef to bring me whatever he felt I would like.  The black cod miso was tasty but super petite and for $40, I would probably not order it again. teh sushi pieces were all outstanding and reasonably priced. The Salmon NS was special and at $30 a tad on the pricey side  The sushi was very good, and my only complaint would be the pretty outrageous price for food. My dinner was $125 and there was no alcohol involved and was there for about 30 minutes.",

The vegan sampling was coordinated with our table.  If you are vegan - you will feel like the king or queen of the table, the attention to detail is like nothing I've ever experienced.  To the carnivores - the sashimi, salmon belly, tempura, filet, EVERYTHING was a culinary delight!   Best dining experience we have ever experienced.  Columbia thank you from the bottom of my family's heart - you made it the best.  To the chef's - True masters of your art!",

    "text": "Had dinner here last night with the bf - decided to splurge a bit on some high quality sushi.  Nobu does have that name and allure.  It was also 4th of July so, why the heck not? The ambiance and environment are what you'd expect from a high end sushi joint like Nobu and it certainly did not disappoint on that end.  But like other luxury places like this one, it's usually more show than anything else.   The food is ridiculously expensive.  It was very good, I cannot lie.  We had a couple appetizers a cocktail each and a sushi platter and some rolls.  The fish is fresh and good quality.  But it's no different than other sushi places that I've been to that are about a quarter the price.   You need money to burn to eat at a place like this.   May go back on a special occasion, and if I have money in my pocket hehe",

I'm not a big drinker so I asked about a lighter fruity drink and I got it, mango passion smelled like heaven and tasted just as refreshing. For my meal I had: lobster tacos, edamame and of course the miso cod =PERFECTION. Love this place and everything about it. Worth every penny.",

That was one of my only downsides, a pretty big one though.  The ambience was like a fancy bar meets sushi. They say they're a Peruvian and Japanese fusion. I had the black cod miso which is supposedly the signature dish. It was good and you can definitely taste the freshness. My party ordered a sushi dinner and few other rolls. Right when you bite into the rolls, the nori itself tastes different than just your standard nori. Food was no doubt good, although I wouldn't say it was to die for either.   I think if I didn't feel like a second class guest, I would've enjoyed the food more, but overall, I would probably give this place another go, but not unless it was for a special occasion.",

This location is unique because they offer teppan yaki. However we chose to sit at the sushi bar for the True experience. Our selection was the omaksase or the Chef's selection. This is supposed to be the best of the best if you are a sushi gourmet. Well, it wasn't. Most importantly the sushi rice was dry and not very flavorful. We had some nigiri and some hot dishes. Not impressed. On top of that the service was slow and we were sitting right in front of the cooks.   If you choose to eat here don't get your hopes up. It is average.",

    "text": "We never even peeked at the menu, since this was our first time, Omakase ($125) was the best way to experience the varied menu. We told our server that we are adventurous diners, we love spicy and we preferred not to have uni since the husband isn't a fan - we left the rest to him. I had a fantastic sauvignon blanc with dinner and the husband really enjoyed the Sake selection. He sampled two excellent chilled varieties: black label and aged.    Our tasting included many of Nobu's signature dishes. We started with Yellowtail with jalapeno. This is a favorite of ours, it's a must whenever we go for sushi. It certainly did not disappoint. The next dish was Tasmanian Ocean Trout, it was rich and creamy. Very different from the delicate and refreshing yellowtail. The next course was Live Scallop with rocoto paste. It was beautifully presented and it tasted even better than it looked. The scallops melted like butter and the heat from the rocoto pepper awakened our taste buds. We enjoyed  chili so much, we were ready to book a trip to Peru.  Next, we sampled some hot dishes, beginning with the Black Cod Miso. This was delicious. The fish was buttery and the miso gave it the ideal amount of sweetness. I understand why it is one of their most popular dishes. Rock Shrimp with jalapeno followed. Now these were tasty morsels. Shrimp is so often overcooked, but not these. Perfection. And highly addictive. For the next course, the focus was on land rather than sea with the Tenderloin of Beef Toban Yaki. The scent of this dish was intoxicating. The beef was prepared very well and it was tasty. However, it was our least favorite.   We wrapped up dinner with a sample of Tuna and Salmon Sushi. Both rolls were simplistic, but incredibly yummy. The rice was beautifully seasoned, key for great sushi. Finally, we finished with a vanilla dessert and a variety of mochi. A lovely end to an exceptional meal.  If you can swing it, the Omakase is an awesome experience. Keeping it simple by choosing a few small plates would be totally worthwhile, too.",

Jonathan who is just delightful gave us the tasting menu. We ended up closing the menu and trusting what he ordered for us. At first I was a bit cautious since last time I did a tasting, I was still hungry at the 7th course! This one did not disappoint! We were stuffed by the end of the night!  We were very well looked after by Jonathan. I'm so glad I went with the cucumber martini. It was so good that I didn't bother trying any other cocktail and that says a lot! I usually try as many as I can handle. Loved loved loved the cucumber martini that I had 3. They used Belvedere. I hope it was certainly in there since after having 3, I wasn't even buzzed.   Each dish that came was an amazing surprise. OMG, everything was so so mouth watering amazingly out of this world good. I salivate as I type this.    It was awesome that every item that was served tasted as if it was caught on the day. It was so so fresh! Oh man, I want some NOW!  Out of all the dishes Jonathan ordered, it was hard to have any favorites. They were all excellent! I mean everything! So enjoy the pics that I posted. I will try not to lick my screen in the meantime.   Oh, at the end of the night, they will ask if you want dessert. I must've gone to the restroom at this time since we didn't get any. I would've still eaten it, LOL! Between the 4 of us, the bill came to around $700. It was SO dang worth it. I will continue to return here in every Vegas trip! YUM! One of my recommended must eat places!",

In addition, the atmosphere is warm and romantic. The service was outstanding, with our waiter returning throughout the meal to see whether we enjoyed the previous dish.  My only criticism would be the price - was certainly expensive, ending at $220 per person after tip and wine. That being said, we ate A LOT that night, so we could have cut back a little.

    "text": "I came to Nobu a few years ago when I was in Vegas. My friend was hungry but I didn't really eat, just had cocktails. He raved about it so I decided to try it on my trip this time.   It was hopping and insanely noisy but my boyfriend and I got seats at the sushi bar immediately. He just drank scotch which he enjoyed while I had dinner. I got the Layer Cake Shiraz which is one my favorites and it pains me how much of a markup they have on it. It's insane, the pour is short, maybe only 4 oz so they can stretch the bottle and they probably bought it for $8 a bottle and it's $15 a glass. Kind of leaves a bad taste in your mouth; I don't mind spending money but come on, that's just sheer greed.  I got the yellowtail and jalapeno appetizer, except it's not really jalapenos. It's serrano peppers and they put too much sauce on the plate. The acidity works well with the fish but since the fish is literally drenched in it, it's overpowering. I got two orders of the salmon belly and two orders of the aji. The salmon belly was awesome. The aji was also good but again, they drenched the nigiri in sauce, so much so that it completely fell apart while I was picking it up to put it in my mouth. I also got the crispy creamy shrimp tempura. It was yummy.   Finally, for dessert, I got the green tea royale. I almost laughed when it was brought out. It was the smallest dessert I've ever seen. Like it was literally 2 inches by 1 inch, a little tiny piece of cake with a teeny tiny scoop of ice cream. It was also weird, the flavors were odd, bubblegum ice cream with green tea cake. Separately they were good but together....not right.   The service also left a lot to be desired. Our waiter rarely checked on us and when he did, he seemed condescending, like he really didn't want to wait on us. I definitely wasn't full but I'd had enough. The bill came to $200 for shrimp tempura, four pieces of nigiri, a yellowtail appetizer, wine and scotch. I'm not sure I got my money's worth.",

We ordered the Premium Sashimi Dinner, 2x Uni, Miso Soup, Edamame, Yellowtail Sashimi w/ Jalapeno, Pork Belly Skewers, Rock Shrimp Tempura and Vegetable Tempura. ALL OF IT WAS UNDERWHELMING.   They brought out the Miso Soup that was lukewarm and tasted like it came from a packet. The Edamame tasted like it was previously frozen. The Yellowtail Sashimi did not taste fresh, it had more of a ceviche texture. The Uni did not taste fresh, in fact it was extremely bland. The Premium Sashimi Dinner came with 3 pieces of otoro that was cut into blocks and throughout the entire piece had a membrane intact that was near impossible to chew through. Rock Shrimp Tempura literally is fried shrimp doused in a mayonnaise textured sauce. The Vegetable Tempura was some of the worst I've had. The only thing that had decent flavor was the Pork Belly Skewers but at $15 for 2 of them, I've had MUCH BETTER.   Our server seemed really pushy in trying to sell the A5 KOBE that they charge $38/oz and you have to get a minimum of 6oz at a total price of $228. When I seemed disinterested in ordering that he seemed more disinterested in waiting on our table. Needless to say I'll never be going back to this overly trendy extremely overpriced excuse for a Japanese restaurant.",

    "text": "Last night, my family and I came here for a family style, Peruvian-Japanese inspired meal. Upon entering the dining area, the staff yelled something in Japanese. The restaurant interior was modern looking, the walls were wavy and the pillow like lights resembled jellyfish. Everyone was given stones to rest their chopsticks on. They only have drink menus with mixed cocktails, Japanese wines, Japanese beers, and Japanese tea. Your job is to tell your waiter/server what you like and what your limitations/restrictions are (e.g., allergies, preferences, budget limit, etc). The waiter/server will talk to the chef to customize dishes.  For sweet and fruity cocktails, I'd recommend the Mango and Passion Cocktail. I could barely taste or feel the alcohol in this drink.   The dishes we received,  1. Six pieces of yellowtail sashimi topped with a jalapeno in ponzu sauce laid out like flower petals and the bud made out of a pile of parsley topped with a carrot shaving.  2. Six pieces of snapper sashimi topped with dry miso rub, garlic chips, and chives, in lemon juice-extra virgin olive oil, also laid out like flower petals and the bud is a grape tomato.   3. A bowl of Mixed Seafood Cerviche. It consisted of pieces of octopus, calamari, salmon, mackerel, shrimp, crab, and lobster mixed with cucumber, red onion, yellow and red tomato, and jalapenos, which gave the dish a hint of spice. It was garnished with two long chives.   4. A Miso Alaskan Black Cod was cooked to perfection - crispy, tender, and sweet miso marinate. It was served on a large piece of banana leaf with a drop of ponzu sauce at four corners of the dish. It was garnished with a two tone pickled ginger root (only the white part was edible), which served as a good palette cleanser.   5. Slices of tender, medium to medium rare Beef Tenderloin marinated in balsamic teriyaki vinaigrette and topped with micro greens and wasabi salsa. The wasabi salsa gave flavor and heat to the dish. There was a dash of seven spices for those who love it extra spicy.  6. A Tower of Chilean Sea Bass Tempura Cubes, garnished with diced onions and jalapeno shavings in sweet Japanese rice vinegar. What an interesting combination. The tempura was crispy and the dish had a hint of jalapeno.  7. Five pan-seared and marinated in line-cilantro Langoustines over a bed of lettuce, zucchini, roasted white pearl onion, baby bok choy, caramelized onions, and mushrooms on a sizzling dish and garnished with Jalapenos and Japanese Chile Threads. It was my least favorite dish as it was drenched in oil and too spicy for me.  We finished our meal with something cool.   7. A bowl of shaved ice and a few mini scoops of vanilla ice cream, drizzled with condensed milk, raspberry puree, and passion fruit puree, and topped with mochi, shredded coconut, fresh berries and grapes. Although it was the most popular dessert here, I felt it wasn't that special but it helped us cool off from the last dish.",

We decided to order a bunch of food and do community style. I got lucky to try multiple delicious dishes like  their lobster, ceviche, shrimp, yellow tail and some amazing vegetarian dishes that chef put together. Their sakes are pretty good too. Again, I got lucky to try many of them, and couldn't be happier. You won't go wrong w Nobu!!",

    "text": "Best described as fast food sushi.  Went here with a group of 6 on a guys weekend. The atmosphere is trendy, hostesses are sexy, and the room is filled with excitement when you enter. We were there to sit back, spend some of our winnings, and have some laughs.   Two of us ordered the Chefs special - which was $175 a person. We were expecting to be wowed, but quickly realized this was nothing more than a gimmick to lure unsuspecting Vegas tourists. Several of the fish pieces contained bone or were not fresh. I sent it back, but only after having to haggle with the server. While they were ultimately appologetic, it was clearly not genuine. We kind of felt that everything was prepared with haste and mass production in mind.   Also, the Chefs special comes out in several courses - ideal for a relaxing time. My only issue with this is that it took more than two hours for our meals to be completed - after our other guests had completed their meals.   Again, the atmosphere is great, but if you are longing for good quality/fresh sushi, you are better off sticking with your local place, where you can look the chef in the eye and thank him at the end of the night.",

We arrived with 5 people and the bartender was rude and said he wouldn't serve us. I asked for a manager, April Lyman, explained that I called prior to arrival, and she told us she wouldn't serve us. She was very rude. I'll never be back. Unreal for such a great restaurant. The service is the reason none of us will be back again.",

The waiter went to the kitchen and checked. She came back and told us: \" we double checked and there were 7 pieces of sea urchins on the plate\". Wow! What happen to the concept: the customers are alway right. We paid $1700 for dinner. $250 tips were automatically added to our bill because there were 8 of us.",

I was pleased to see that my favorite salad, the mushroom salad was on the menu which is not served at all Japanese restaurants. The entrees were small and the price was huge. This girl likes to eat so The bill was rather large. I had a shot of tequila which I regret. I loved the martini I do not recall having. I just remember I loved it according to my friend who was dining with me. Oh and I also had a few cocktails. (yummy cocktails with great flavors of fresh cucumber)  I would compare Nobu to Sen of Japan which is another  fine dining Japanese restaurant. Both places have mushroom salads. Do not go to either of these places with a big stomach unless you expect to spend a couple hundred. The food quantity to a tapas restaurant.",

The food was delicious and fresh.  We did the tasting menu which came with some sushi dishes, some hot fish dishes,  and a red meat dish.  I highly recommend the tasting menu because you get to try a lot of different items on the menu.  However, it will cost you an arm and a leg!  The service is excellent.

Then we asked for spilt checks and couldn't even get that so amongst ourselves we had to figure out the split which the bill didn't include sales tax.  Our waitress never checked in.

The service was outstanding from the server picking out the historical favorites to the food runners explaining the dishes as they drop them off even going as far as telling us how to consume them.  We started off on the Cold Dishes and had the Yellow Fin with Jalapeno and Cilantro and it ended up being one of the best things we have every eaten.  We also really enjoyed the Spicy Peppers from the starters.  If you have never been to Nobu this would be a great way to start.  Our server then told us to try the Cod with Miso sauce.  This is the chef's speciality.  The most surprising part of this dish was not the taste which was amazing.  our how flakey and light the fish was.  It was the size.  The portion size was huge!  A absolute must to try.  To finish off the dinner I had the sashimi section and she had the rolls.  We both agreed Nabu would have been five stars if the rolls were better.  But what do you expect they are rolls?  The seaweed wrap took away from the flavor of the fish.",

The service is amazing and the serving size is just right. It is family style so they encourage you to order a few more dishes than usual because it's for sharing and the sizes are not that big.  Here's what we ordered: -Salmon Tartare with Caviar (It was so fresh and soft. The salmon pieces were also cut much smaller than other tartares, beef and tuna, that I have had before.) -Yellow tail Jalapeno (My ABSOLUTE FAVOURITE!!! I can eat this day and night. I'm not one to eat a lot of spicy food, but a small slice on top of the fish isn't bad at all.) -Chilean Sea Bass with Balsamic Teriyaki (ddddelicious! so tender!) -Squid 'Pasta' with Light Garlic (Mind you the past is the is the squid pieces. There is no actual pasta. It was so good! The squid wasn't chewy at all!) -Tasmanian Ocean Trout with Crispy Baby Spinach (the spinach wilted a bit in the sauce, so eat it quick. It may get too salty that way.) -Bento Box and Kinako Crunch for dessert (both delicious and delicately made, but I'd prefer to eat the main dishes and appetisers)  I wish I had eaten everything on that menu! :o)",

They do push a little too much for you to order many items at once, but keep in mind you can order a few things and add on later.  We did not order dessert because we were too full from ordering too many items.  The drinks were just okay and we felt they were overpriced, like the \"Blood of the Gods\" cocktail which was very small, sweeter than expecting and lacking flavors.  Food wise, the quality of the ingredients are the freshest around.  The tempura was slightly disappointing as we have basic tempura in our minds but the plate was small pieces sitting in a sauce so there is really not much crunch.  Toro was to die for!  The salmon belly sushi roll, so flavorful!",

    "text": "This should be a 3.5 star restaurant (when adjusted by price). The service is great (just like Sushisamba's) and they take care of you very fast. The waiter was the best waiter I've had so far. He was a trainee as I could see someone shadowing him and giving him prompts. He was really nice, explained to us how this restaurant was Peruvian influenced Japanese food. I did not say that I was Peruvian myself (not sure if this would have made a difference).  It is very expensive but I guess that is not a surprise. Anyways, we came here due to Groupon. They had a pretty good 5 course meal for $95. I will (want) to assume that this made no difference as to how the meal was prepared for us.   It started with Edamame, which was pretty good. It had rocky salts all over it which made it taste way better than just plain old edamame. This dish I've seen in different versions in different japanese restaurants so it was not something new.  The second dish was I think 6 pieces of sushi and a california roll. The sashimi was meh I didn't feel it was specially good or bad, just ok. Nothing melted in my mouth. Also, the california roll was the only reason why I was not super hungry at the end. Since it was given to us second, then by the end of the meal metabolism had done its share.  The third dish was (the famous) yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno sauce. In my opinion it was really good. As a Peruvian, I am used to eating ceviche and tiradito. This obviously is more similar to a tiradito but the sauce had an extra kick that I loved. It was really good. If I had to go back here, I would only order this and leave.  The fourth dish was (the also famous) black cod miso. I liked it a lot. Tasted really great and I liked the sweet flavor. Now, it is probably True that if I did not know that this dish was so big I would have probably said it was excellent. I just had higher expectations as to what a great dish should be like.   Last dish was desert. The brought us the bento box. I liked the flourless cake and something that came in a capuccino cup.  Great meal overall, I felt like I was in a great restaurant but I feel it is slightly overrated. The waiter kept asking everytime about how great the food was. I guess they just expected us to clap right after eating a bite of something.  Oh! be warned. This restaurant does not have a bathroom. It shares the bathroom with the casino! Why!?   Oh! If you are into plum wine, as I am. The one that they carry was really good.",

    "text": "Eating at Nobu has spoiled me, and has set the bar high for expectations for future dining experiences in Vegas!  Four of us went to Nobu with the intent of \"going all out\", trying some of their best dishes, and we were not disappointed.  The atmosphere of the restaurant is fairly casual, not cramped, and the decor is simple and warm.  There are perfect settings for larger groups or intimate dining experiences.  Something that made our experience so enjoyable was our server, who provided some great recommendations after we told him what type of dining experience we were after.  He was also able to provide us with some equivalents to some favourite dishes from Nobu in SanDiego.  Favourite dishes, in no particular order:  1.  Wagyu beef- we ordered 10oz, and although quite pricey, totally worth every penny.  The presentation at the table, of the beef on hot rocks and flambeed at the table was followed by the most melt-in-your-mouth beef you'll try this side of Japan!  2.  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno- I might have to use melt-in-your-mouth many times during this review.... the yellowtail was so delicious and included 6 pieces on the plate.  Although not a large portion, each little bite was satisfying!  3.  Rock Shrimp Jalapeno- the sauce on the rock shrimp was so flavourful, with a slight spiciness to it. It was served over greens which were perfect for getting the last its of the sauce from the serving dish.  4.  Black Cod Miso-  this perfectly cooked fish falls apart at the slightest touch, and is infused with the wonderful, slightly salty miso flavour.  Other dishes that were quite good included the red snapper***, and the seafood soup.  The only dish that was disappointing was the salmon belly*** which was the waiter's recommendation as it is a favourite dish at Nobu.  It wasn't as good as the yellowtail or snapper, and it seemed way overpriced at $50 for 6 pieces.  We did order some sushi rolls, which kind of seemed unnecessary after the other indulgences we had just had, and they weren't anything special compared to other good sushi restaurants.  Some reviewers balk at the Nobu prices, but I think people need to consider what they're looking for before they head to Nobu.  If you're looking for high quality food, tastefully presented, and a high end atmosphere, then the price is worth it... maybe only once a year though!",

    "text": "Nobu was on my list of restaurants to visit while in Las Vegas. I'm glad I made a visit!  I'm not a big sushi eater, so I was a bit worried about visiting. But I was told it was a great place for beginner/mild sushi lovers on Yelp and by some other Las Vegas visitors. Evidently, sushi is serious business.  Not to say Nobu isn't- once you see the prices on the menu you will know that they are very serious. The service is on par as well, as our waiter was very knowledgeable and had great suggestions that fit me and my more sushi knowledgeable friend. We had a great meal of 3 entrees- the Rock Shrimp with all three sauces, Salmon tacos, and Toasted Rice Cake. I would definitely recommend to a friend. No, it isn't budget friendly... but seriously, considering the type of restaurant it is and the place it's at, why would you expect it to be? Be prepared to spend some money.",

This new location is in caesers palace and it is as good as the NYC one.  I had 3 orders of new style sashimi it was heavenly.  Melted in my mouth!  So much better than most ordinary sashimi.    Umami sea bass was ok.  It was good but not something I would seek out at Nobu.  The black cod miso was the absolute highlight of my dinner.  The meat just pealed off layer by layer...it had a great sweet and salty balance..and it melted in my mouth.  I only wished I ordered one less new style sashimi so I can order another one.",

Their biggest problem...  WAITERS/SERVER  But let's go through food first.  Don't order multiple dishes w YUZU sauce, YUZU.. anything. You're tummy will hurt.  1. Yellowtail sashimi with Jalapeno w YUZU sauce. It's WAYYY TOO SOUR. YUZU is sour, but I think they could have done something, so that sourness was tamed. NOT worth $28. You can get great yellowtail, elsewhere for cheaper. And the slices were so freakin' thin. ARE YOU KIDDING ME??!  2. beef, pork... skewers. These were actually really great, especially the pork. Very tasty. it's $$$$ for the price, but if you're there to dine, try it.   3. Tasmanian Ocean Trout w Crispy Baby Spinach and Yuzu soy. Good, but again, it's very small portion for $28... more trout please. where was my trout? did we get any trout?   4. Tamago. THE WORST TOMAGO EVER. IT's like salty sweet egg floury cake. NOT TOMAGO. it's more like cake-textured. Tasted AWFUL! NOT WORTH $8. It looks pretty because they \"stamp\" NOBU on it. BUT you're there to dine w your tummy, too. Not just your eyes.   5. Beef Tenderloin - Toban-yaki. not worth $36. Tasted blah, and portion is def not $36.   and we ordered couple more dishes.. but I don't recall..  Here's the SERVER/WAITER issue: If you're restaurant is a FAB restaurant w dishes that are $$$$$, watier/server should not be SELLING YOU or PUSHING YOU to get dishes. Our server/waiter kept pushing us to get all these dishes rather than... recommending. He KEPT saying we should order duplicate dishes when our group wanted a taste of different dishes. He pushed us so much, we got way too many YUZU incorporated dishes... and it was SO TART, SO SOUR... it ruined our appetite. We spent almost 2.5 hours just saying NO...We were asked \"ARE YOU SURE?\" so many times.. I lost count. Had the service been a little better... we'd enjoyed our meal.  We went to Nobu because of all the hype surrounding it. But I was thoroughly disappointed. Will not be making another stop ever again. Thanks, but not thanks.   Too expensive, too little food, too blah, too pushy...",

Food: 4, Atmosphere: 4.5, Service: 3 Cost to worth it rating: 2.5 (didn't find quality to be miles above other Japanese restaurants to warrant the pricing) Return worthiness: maybe Eve award: best fancified shave ice  Highlights: - Big portions: expected tiny plates for the tasting menu, but the portions were really large. Started with 3 huge pieces of white tuna  - Shaved ice: huge mound of airy shaved ice with fruit, jellies, mochi and tofu ice cream hidden below. Tofu ice cream had a firmer texture that was a nice contrast to the delicate ice above it. 2 sauces were provided to pour over: green tea and passion fruit. Surprisingly the hit of the night  - Variety of sashimi: 3 different preparations and 6 in the nigiri set - Decor: loved the modern, lively, open feel to it with bursts of color - Flourless chocolate cake: I've had a lot of these, and this was an excellent rendition. Warm and melty inside with a bit of a crunchy exterior layer. Appreciated the Asian flair in the bento box presentation and green tea ice cream pairing. - Not all have to tasting menu: like this as it makes ordering easier especially with the non-seafood eating hub - Cocktails: fun menu--we tried a few  Midlights: - Service: hard to catch our waiter   Lowlights: - Undercooked miso cod: this is a signature dish, so was very disappointing. It had a gummy texture and didn't flake off like it should.  Had a good meal here but not sure I'd race back.",

Now although I gave it 5 stars the price is definitely something that would bring my rating down. However the food was that good, just wish there was more of it for the price we paid. Apparently it was a quieter day in the restaurant, as our buser informed us, but it was just perfect for us...a couple who want to be able to hear ourselves when we have a conversation. Now we did have some complaints, water being spilled all over my husband's feet as the buser was trying to refill water glasses at the table next to us, bones found in our fish dish. Our waiter apologized profusely for all those matters. But that was it.",

I think it was about 7 courses in total and we got to try at least 20 different items that way. At $125 I thought that was a good deal considering the prices on the menu. There was a sushi sampler, sashimi sampler, tartare sampler, 2 mains, dessert and more. Service was excellent.  The drinks were good too. The seating was cozy but I did drop a point from them because overall the ambience and design doesn't match the high priced menu. Especially the bathroom! 4 dingy stalls that weren't even that clean for that huge restaurant ! I'm sorry but if you want to be a five star restaurant you absolutely have to have the bathroom to match. All that space- they could have devoted a little more square footage to that and they need to upkeep it more often. It wasn't even that busy the day we went for it to be in that condition so early in the evening. Also, they said they were fully booked but we decided to give it a shot and walk by- half the tables were empty. So if you were really hoping to eat here and they tell you they are booked, just show up anyways.",

My friends and I walked sat in the lounge area, very classy, high class etc etc.  Now the service could have been a little better. They didn't seem to be that busy at the time and it may have been since we were just lounge area guests that we just got overlooked here and there. We even told the server we were in a bit of a hurry but even with that it took about 20 minutes to just get our order in and that was a little on the irritating side. And especially with the price that you pay for this restaurant, the wait staff could definitely be a bit more attentive.  Now it took an additional 30ish minutes to get our order out but when it came out, it was a gorgeous presentation with about 4-5 people bringing out the various orders we had.  The fish, was definitely fresh and the black cod was to die for but in terms of price to value I think I would still prefer other sushi locales on the strip. I've eaten at other similiar prices venues and great service should be synonymous with such. With better service this could easily be a 4 star review.",

    "text": "Short version: Very good food, very expensive. If you don't care about price (either you are rich, are splurging, or got comped), this is an awesome place to eat.  Long version: It was my last night in Vegas and I decided to splurge. This is definitely an expensive place to eat. Get over it.   The restaurant decoration is classy with several areas to choose from: the bar, the lounge, the sushi bar, and booths. There is a high ratio of waiter to customer. Most of the waiters are very conscious about what's happening on each of their tables and empty dishes are cleared within a minute. Some of the bust help were not as quick but that's understandable. Jonathan was my server and he was very knowledgeable about each of the dishes. He even know the proper Japanese names for the food and dishes. Impressive.  Now the food: I had 2 appetizers, 2 main courses, and some sushi.  The lobster taco and Wagyu taco were very good. The shells were deep fried gyoza wrapping. The lobster were steamed and the wagyu were grilled (I think). Topped with a variety of toppings, the bite size (literally 1 bite each) taco had great flavor.  Even though they were a bit small, even for appetizer. 3 star for this dish.  The second appetizer was the yellowtail with jalapeno. The fish was super fresh. I live in Hawaii and I know what fresh yellowtail taste like. This IS fresh. The ponzu sauce was light and did not overwhelm the dish. The thin slices of jalapeno made perfect compliment.  Each bite was a delight. 5 star for this. (Incidentally, a week later, I was back in Hawaii at Dash Gastropub and they had the same dish.  Let's just say it was good contrast.)  I had the black cod miso because I read so much about it. A good size piece of cod, marinated in miso, rinsed off, and grilled. The flavor was very good but it was strong so I had to order a bowl of rice ($5?!) to enjoy it fully. BTW, the ginger sprout garnish was a very good compliment.  I wish there were more than 2.  Even though it dish itself was very good ... but coming from Hawaii, we are used to eating miso butterfish. I can buy it marinated in the supermarket, take it home, rinse it off, grill it and it would have turned out to be exact same thing... for a fraction of the price. Value wise... I have ding it. 3 stars.  The pork belly kushiyaki with spicy miso is basically cubes of pork belly (meat and fat, not skin tho), skewered, grilled, have a spicy miso paste brushed on, grilled again, and served. The pork was very tender. The fat did not feel fatty, the miso was tasty and flavorful. This is a very good dish and I would eat it any day. 5 stars.  If I have to pick on something, it would be that it is quite heavy so you probably shouldn't eat more than 2 skewers.  Ladies should look at 1 per person.  After the 4 courses, I needed a little bit more so I ordered some sushi.  The anago and unagi were excellent. In fact, this is the first time ever I like the anago better than the unagi in any restaurant. 4 stars each.  The snow crab leg was decent. 3 stars.  The soft shell crab maki on the other hand was a disappointment. The roll was gummy and the crab was not pronounced at all. Not going to order it again.  There is no question that this place serves good food.  Majority of the dishes are very well done. The main issue here remains: value. Would I eat here again?  In a heartbeat, as long as I don't have to foot the bill. Maybe I'll pay if I have a gold digger girlfriend that I need to impress...",

The Jidori Free Range Chicken and the Tenderloin of Beef were succulent and tasy. Sweet Shrimp with Fried Head as well as the Yellowtail and Jalapenos were delicious.  Our server was hospitable and accommodating. He made us feel so comfortable throughout our dining experience.   I really recommend this place for any special occasion or just a splurge for dinner.",

Reservations are easy, the ambience is perfect and the food is out of this world.  Had a reservation for 8 people for a business dinner and the server we had ordered our meal for us! Family style, Asian fusion. Drinks are good, service is fast, and the employees are all very friendly and nice!!  I recommend making reservations because even the bar area was full.  We will come back! Get the waygu on rocks, you won't be disappointed.  This place is pricy, so bring your appetite and your wallet:)",

    "text": "I was very underwhelmed with the food and the service.   Disclaimer: we aren't sashimi eaters, so this may have had something to do with it. However, we love other kinds of Japanese food and my mom just got back from Japan so I had high expectations.   Beef tenderloin toban-yaki: essentially grilled sizziling steak. It was good, but not anything special if you've had good filet mignon before.   Waygu gyoza: REALLY disappointing. Beef tasted ok but they were largely flavorless and had thin gummy skins that were actually wonton wrappers not gyoza skins. If you've ever had a homemade skin you know these weren't it. Also wasn't a fan of the gritty pumpkin puree under the gyoza.   Assorted tempura: good, but not the best I've had. I was expecting to be mind blown.   Service: So bad. My mom has food allergies and our server was arrogant and unhelpful. He also lacked the enthusiasm for food that I expect servers to have in higher-end restaurants. We realized later we had both missed the middle page of the menu and there were so many items he could have suggested when we were talking to him about what to order. The water server with tattoos was much nicer.   Overall the experience was 'meh' which made it not worth the money. There are far better restaurants in Vegas and I won't be back unless my sashimi eating husband is desperate to go.",

We opted for the omakase $125 menu, and it was delicious! Our server said this is a great option to try out the popular items on their menu. I also ordered a really delicious pineapple martini. I'd get it again.   The first four dishes ware served cold with raw fish. The sashimi was so fresh and melted in my mouth. The next two dishes were the hot protein dishes. I loved the miso cod dish. It was slightly sweet, but still tasted great. Next was the miso soup, which was a great way to end our savory meal. Last was dessert, which was amazing! This meal will fill you up, so come hungry!",

We started with two orders of ungi, four Toro, and one order of Hamachi. All were really good. Not as fresh as the Nobu in Oahu but it was still good. For our main course we got the 6oz Waygu, Lobster (special of the day), and the Alaskan King Crab. Love everything except the Crab Leg. For 75 I was expecting a bigger leg than the one we got. It looks like they went to the Buffet in Caesar and took one of the crab leg and put some Uni. I did like the sauce.   Our second visit here we ordered the two specials of the day which was the Toro w/ 7yrs aged soy sauce and truffle oil and the Bone In Rib Eye Waygu w/ fried onion and truffle oil. Now these two dishes is worth coming back for. The Toro was so soft and buttery! We had two order anther 6 pieces because that's how good it is. About 6-8 pieces was around 100. The Rib Eye was 6oz and was filled with fried onions. I like the flavor but it did get salty after 4 bites. This dish was about 100 too. We wanted to try another dish so we decided to get the Black Cod Miso. I know Nobu is known for this dish so I didn't understand why it came out super salty. I ate the Black Cod in Oahu and it wasn't this salty. I'll skip on this dish while dining in this Nobu. Our server nick name is Columbia and he's was amazing!! Such an amazing host and explained everything on the menu to us. They were 1 hour from closing and he still made sure we had the best experience at Nobu.",

    "text": "I took a client to Nobu/Vegas about a month and a half ago. First, the absolute worst service from a waiter. Ever. Refused to give us menus because none of us had been to Nobu in Vegas (waiters words, not mine). \"I'll just start bringing food out and trust me, you'll love it all.\" About 30-45 minutes later, the waiter says, \"BTW, we have 3 different price tiers here, 1) $150-$200 2) $250-$300 and 3) $300+.\" Huh? So, menus are denied and 30-45 min into all of this food brought out to us, we're told about the \"3 price tiers?\" I even told our waiter that there are a couple people at our table who are vegetarians. Not much attention to that whatsoever, but a whole lot of attention on no menus and price tiers.   I had an opportunity to step away from the table and briefly talk with the waiter. I kindly told him that we're not splitting the bill 7 ways here, just 1 way. And that there were those at our table who wanted menus. I was completely blown off. 2 hours later, our waiter asks if we'd like dessert. The consensus was that we were all full but thank you anyway. 10 min later, an extra large lazy suzan sized platter shows up at our table loaded with 2-3 different desserts!   The bill comes and the waiter says, \"I only charged $187/person, which is on the low end of the tiers.\" Bill was almost $1600 and with tip it came to almost $1900. I don't complain about much, most especially restaurant service. In front of a client either. But, we were railroaded! He kept saying, \"we do it different here at Nobu in Vegas.\" They sure do, I just would've appreciated being told about the price tiers at the very beginning. I asked why we couldn't have menus. I pretty much got the \"don't worry about it\" response.   I called the restaurant a couple days later and the gal who answered the phone says it isn't the 1st time someone has reached out about the same incident and the same waiter. I said I don't want all my money back, rather just want to bring this to light and also offered to split the bill with them as a result. 3-4 days later, the GM says they'll only reimburse the tip.   A warning to those who've never been to Nobu in Vegas.",

Their dessert menu is now a major disappointment. Their shaved ice was once their crown jewel and now thanks to their new chef, I can say it is officially dead. They have changed and morphed this dessert so much that soon it will just be a snow cone. You're better off going buying cookies from the Honolulu cookie company then wasting your money <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhere.at&s=aae7c0635356f78a9014a5413ed94b4f89fb7870335f962a8cd5ebe4edcf38ad\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">here.at</a> The shaved ice is just that ice, honey and pineapple flavor but it's lacking flavor and the complexity that it once had. Presentation is nothing more than ice thrown into a very small bowl. How the mighty have fallen. A snow cone off a truck offers more flavor way cheaper. Their sidecar drink was also a disappointment drink was missing something as well. ? .#majordisappointment #nolongerworthit.",

The yellowtail and jalapeno roll was delightfully melt-in-your mouth. And the vegetable tempura cooked perfectly crisp.  Otherwise, I had high expectations for the food that just weren't met. The salmon tartar/caviar appetizer was perfectly fine, but the caviar had no flavor, the portion was tiny, and could have used a chip on which to consume the tartar. The miso chip/tuna appetizer was coated in a thick, sweet, satay-style sauce that overpowered any tuna flavor. The spicy tuna roll was not spicy and seemed pretty boring.  The gross price wasn't a concern - we knew we were sitting in an expensive restaurant. We just felt disappointed with the price/portion/innovation ratio and the sense that many of the flavors could be found in sushi restaurants across America. A complete contrast to Bouchon - at which we ate previously - which fully exceeded the price/portion/innovation expectations.",

This is my 4th time at Nobu we always had a great experience with both food & service but today the server was just HORRIBLE!!!  I never order off menu because I usually get experienced servers that recommend dishes to my party. Today On my Birthday I expected the same type of  treatment.  Our server seemed annoyed when he spoke to my party when I asked him to recommend something special off he recommended. Eel roll, crab roll..... I kept asking him to recommend specials I wanted more effort from Him I obviously sound like I know how to eat and that's the shit you recommend me? I even placed an order for toro & black truffle carpaccio to give him an idea of the kind of palette we have. He was obviously did not know the menu well himself & had a bad attitude about it.  The food was good as usual. I really enjoyed the toro with black truffle but then he turned us off by telling us it was from a can. Service is everything & Columbia (servers name?) really killed our mood tonight. For a $900 dinner including tax & tip  I expect nothing less than EXCELLENT food & service. I Myself have almost 20years in f&b experience and over a decade in hospitality industry and today SADLY Nobu did NOT deliver. We all left unsatisfied and honestly a little upset. On the receipt it says our servers name was \"Columbia\" I probably won't be back again unless Nobu Changes up the menu & comes up with different dishes with more variety & hires more  experienced polite servers and may I also mention my parents are 7 star elite members for Cesars....",

This was my third time, and each visit has been consistent in all aspects of the experience from food quality to service.   I came here this time with my family whom hadn't had a Nobu experience before, so we decided on the signature Omakase as way to try the 'greatest hits.'  It was superb. The sequencing of the food, the pacing of the food, the care of preparation and presentation... Spot on.  The signature Omakase is a very 'safe' choice to dine... it's composed of classic and popular raw and cooked dishes... nothing too exotic, but perfectly prepared. I personally prefer the chef's daily and specialty Omakase as it tends to be a bit more adventurous... but nothing I've had is very far out tbh... just delicious and consistent.   Great as always.",

I like sushi but I usually don't stray too far from the beaten path and I'm not that adventurous. So when the table decided to go with the Omakase Menu with the Chef's Daily selection for our meal, I was understandably apprehensive. I am a risk averse person by nature, but I am so glad I rolled with it.   I cannot tell you the name of every dish that was brought to us, because, hey it's Vegas, and I was not clinically sober. But each one seemed to be more unique and mouth wateringly flavorful than the last. I do remember the Japanese Red Snapper as my favorite one though. It was a smorgasbord of taste and adventure. And the drinks were top notch as well. Yes, it was wildly expensive but you have to treat yourself once in a while. I'm so glad I did.",

    "text": "The space is beautiful and the food is good. However, I have dined at other fine Japanese/sushi restaurants in Vegas and other major cities that were much more memorable and at a more reasonable price point. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed my experience (and I am a huge fan of Robert De Niro) but I just can't put my finger on what was missing as I am not dying to return. For anyone who hasn't dined here and wondering about the expense, be prepared to spend at least $100 pp. Also, be prepared to spend $10 on a lobster taco that is the size of your thumb. :-)  About my meal: All orders are small plates. This makes it fun bc you get to try several different items throughout dinner. There are cold and hot options and also a sushi section of the menu. I ordered 6 items and the fresh lychee/grapefruit cocktail.   I don't remember what my first item was. It was sashimi topped with a slice of jalapeno. It was obviously pretty forgettable.   My favorite item was the black cod miso. I understand this is one of their well known/popular dishes. I can see why. It melts in your melt with terrific flavor. This is a must try.  The crispy rice and tuna was very filling! Definitely shareable with a few people. It was tasty. Make sure to add a generous amount of tuna to each bite. I had a lot left over.   The salmon dish was good. Interesting take with the olive oil. I love olive oil. Healthy fats for the win with this dish!  It's always fun to be adventurous and try things you've never had. I recommend ending your meal with a couple pieces of unique sushi. I enjoyed the bonito and barracuda. While the fish was delicious, each piece was HUGE and kind of annoying to eat bc I didn't want to take multiple bites. Maybe the chef would prepare smaller pieces next time?   If I return, I would only do the sushi (maybe omakase), a glass of wine, and save some room for dessert.",

    "text": "Been to other Nobu's and this one is also as awesome as the other chain I have been to. If you are looking to fine dine with Japanese Cuisine, Nobu is the way to go.   Excellent customer service as standards to Nobu. The menu is slightly different but it is hands down one of the best Omakase in Sin City. When dinning at Nobu, I usually just get their Omakase because I want to get a little taste of everything that the chef suggests and recommends. From start to finish, every course is delicious and all their fish/ingredients are fresh. The Omakase also seem to be a good deal to me since you get a small portion of their signature on each course and each course is prepared in a presenting way that is very IG worthy. If you are indecisive and want to splurge when you are in Vegas, try out Nobu! I am certain that they will not disappoint you :)",

Our waiter was knowledgeable and had a good sense of humor. The pace wasn't rushed at all. The roasted hamachi collar was my favorite followed closely by the incredible whole lobster tempura. The table next to us had the  omikase and many of their dishes were what we had individually selected (they did have many more dishes however... I'm not that big of an eater so I'm not sure where I would put all that food).  It's wasn't terribly expensive and was well worth the time and price! We thought people would be dressed up. Some were, others were very casual. We will be back to try more choices and revisit the favorites.",

The menu is similar if not identical to the one at Hard Rock. All the menu favourites are there, including the tempura king crab. Prices are the same, too. Ask for the off-menu miso black cod appetizer.  Service was the ubiquitous merry-go-round of different staff for taking the order, beverages, food, etc., which I don't love. I would prefer to deal with one person throughout a meal.  Bonus: you can use your Caesars Rewards to pay.",

She was able to answer any questions we had about the menu, and checked in on us just the right amount of times (enough to not ignore us, but not too much where we couldn't enjoy our meal).  Great hire on management's part.  We were served too many dishes to name, but rest assured that everything was delicious. Their menu is on the pricier side, but is very much worth it.  I have had pleasant dining experiences at their other locations, but none quite like this. I did notice some not so pleasant reviews, so it is possible we just caught them on a good night.

Different presentation approach as well since it was on a bed of lettuce (puts you in the mind of a ceviche lettuce wrap). Either way it was the best I've ever had.   Next the rock shrimp. Idk where they get the shrimp or how they make that mild sauce but man I'm still craving them. They were lighting fried and coated with light sauce and I swear they seemed to melt In your mouth. I understand now what the hype about them was. Great job Nobu.    Followed by he shrimp up with some beef teriyaki skewers. Great taste cooked a perfect medium rare. Nothing over the top but a great combination of flavors.   Now the sushi. Blue Fin Tuna is worth the price. Great fresh taste. I've been craving it for months. Shrimp tempura was great as well. Simple toll but executed perfectly.   I had the Smokey Old Fashion that was on special which was amazing. The wife had the mango martini...which lasted all of 3 minutes. She said if she could order a pitcher of it she would.   Thank you Nobu for a great experience. Will definitely be back soon!",

    "text": "An overall excellent dining experience! Walking by the Sushi bar, we can see it was full of fresh fish. Menu was massive and we wanted to try everything so we settled on a couple of Omakase Specials and some additional varieties. The entire dining experience took about two hours and it was a treat for our taste buds.  They also had Wagyu beef by the ounce, which was done to perfection. Although they staff here recommend an ounce per person it's not enough because once you start eating it, you can't stop. Their Omakase non-cooked food was excellent, but the cooked items was a bit on the salty side that covered up some of the freshness.  We also tried their Foie Gras sushi with Balsamic Vinegar, and although it was tasty we found the Balsamic a bit over powering.  They don't do any blended drinks here, but do give their other drink a shot.",

I had the signature Black Cod Miso and it was cooked very well. I also had shrimp and it was delicious. It's pretty pricey, but that's to be expected from Nobu. The restaurant is very pretty and they were able to accommodate a group of 7. The waiter recommended family style, but we asked to order individually. The plates were still brought out family style, not a big deal but something to note. Also, they don't do individual checks. The waitstaff in general were quite gruff, but the hostesses were friendly.",

    "text": "My wife and I wanted to finally try Nobu since we consider Yellowtail at the Bellagio to be kind of the Gold Standard for sushi on the strip.  We realize that you are going to find some terrific places off the strip but we are never in the mood to go into some strip center in the middle of nowhere up here.  We come for the vibe and the energy.  That said, you sacrifice a bit and you also are going to be paying a premium which is expected.  We also wanted to use a $100 dining credit that was given to us since I had Caesars Diamond status.  If you have that card, go and check with the VIP desk and grab it.  It's a nice benefit.    To start with, I am not a huge fan of the layout and being right next to people on a small two-top table.  There is zero intimacy that way and you are basically sitting on your neighbor's lap.  That was the case here even though we had a reservation.  I did get to know everything about the couple's dinner next to me however.    I went with a basic Pinot Grigio which was good and the price wasn't bad at $14/glass.  My wife went with a Grapefruit On The Rocks drink which she said was pretty good.  We started with the Yellowtail Jalapeno which we felt was very good.  Temperature, texture and heat were on point.  That was probably the best dish for me of all that we ordered.    We also got the Hamachi Kama Collar which was kind of mushy and really not that great.  When the meat came off, it kind of ended up looking like tuna in the can.  I would give it a \"C\" at best which is probably somewhat generous.  At $27, the expectations were a lot higher.    My wife wanted the Rock Shrimp Tempura which was decent but somewhat odd was that they charge you $3/ea for a Butter Ponzu and a Creamy Jalapeno sauce.  At a restaurant like this, it feels like a cheap add-on that was unnecessary since deep fried rock shrimp at $30 is basically at the top of the price-point anyway.    My wife ordered the Black Cod Miso which was good.  She has had it at other Nobu restaurants and it is usually pretty consistent.  It's probably her favorite Nobu dish.     We ordered the Cold Special dish as well which was $50 and again, just ok.    As for sashimi, we ordered 2 pieces of Shima Aji and also Kinmei dai.  They were average.  Nothing more than that.  Texture was fine but a little warm in temperature like they had been sitting for a few minutes.    My wife finished with a double espresso which she enjoyed.    I think to sum it up, it was a mediocre experience.  We have been to several Nobu restaurants and this one didn't live up to our expectations.  When the bill with drinks is close to $450 for two, you just want it to \"Wow,\" you somewhat and it didn't in this instance.",

    "text": "Nobu is once in a life time experience and I am so happy I got to experience it.    Overall, best meal of my life.  And as a foodie, I have eaten at a TON of places.  Only reason it wasn't 5 stars was for service and price.  While this place is Japanese, and has \"sushi\" on the menu, the server made note that they are \"not a sushi restaurant\", and now I get it.    The menu is overwhelming and lacks description so its hard to even know what to order.  We opted for the chef's tasting menu (Omakase Menu).  We are both very adventurous eaters so this was a fun way to experience dinner.  There are 3 tiers of this menu based on price.  First tier is $150-$200 per person (not including drinks) for a 7 course meal.  The server claimed it would be \"tailored\" to us specifically by asking how we enjoyed dishes or other questions from the chef.  This did not happen and in fact, the server did not return to ask what we thought of some of the dishes.  Disappointing, because I witnessed the service (different server) of the table next to me and it was not the same service.  The first dish Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno was by far the best and was what made me immediately love Nobu.  I can't begin to explain what all was in it because there were so many layers of flavors.  I wished I had more!   Another dish was Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna.  Bite size square of rice, deep fried and served with tuna tartar for scooping.    Final hot dish was Premium Imported Japanese Wagyu - $38 per ounce.  Which ended up being $100.  Oh so tender and flavorful.  Topped with fried shallots.  It was divine.  We specifically requested a dessert item, I'm not sure if it would have been included.  There were 2 items on the plate.  1 was a chocolate molten cake which was so boring and felt out of place with the high quality of the rest of the meal.  We had a bite each and didn't finish it.  Some green icecream which I think was green tea or matcha.  I enjoyed it.  The other item was some form of tart which was very good.   Overall I loved Nobu.  I would highly recommend it for non picky eaters.",

    "text": "They say that the Nobu Way is to start with the cold plates, move towards the hot plates, and end with sushi. Although we didn't have the pre-fixed menu, we put that Nobu way in mind and ordered separate plates.   We ordered: Field Greens- a simple salad which was super refreshing. Wagyu Tacos- super small. Don't let the pictures fool you. These were so good, I'd recommend ordering more than just the 2 minimum. The sauce was good, but the wagyu didn't need it. Wagyu Gyoza- huge fan of gyoza, but not these ones. I felt like I ate a dumpling filled with fat. Nope. Rock Shrimp with the creamy sauce- my favorite dish of the night! The shrimp had a nice crunch to it but wasn't overly battered like most fried shrimp.  Tempura Sushi with soy paper- best sushi I've ever had. Not only was it delicious, but it was tightly packed unlike other sushi I've had; other spots that replace the seaweed with soy paper never tightly pack the sushi and everythinf always becomes undone. The shrimp inside was also one of the best. They didn't stick the tail in my shrimp. It was clean, lightly battered as well, and also juicy! Miso Cheesecake- according to our server, this is a fan favorite. It sounded overwhelming with its description on the menu but it was the best, lightest, and smoothest dessert! The dulce de leche crunch was the best touch.   The service was amazing. I enjoyed that they brought one plate at a time and let us have mini breaks in between dishes.   Now that I've tried Nobu for the first time, I know it won't be my last. Thank god for it being the Bay Area. lol",

    "text": "The 1 star is not for the servers, they were great. The bartenders and the drinks were great too. The 1 star is for the experience right at check-in, the actual food and the fact that the server probably hasn't tasted the food in a while because the dish I ordered was his suggestion.   Check-in problem: We were a group of 10. We all arrived there together and on time for our appointment. We were at the restaurant. They did not have our table ready and we were fine with that, so 2 of our people went to the bar and ordered 1 drink.   Our table became available before the time they stated it would be ready, but because the 2 were not standing at the check-in, but at the restaurant bar waiting for their drink to be made in their own restaurant, they counted that as the party not being there! WHAT? The bartenders are doing a great job, but they had several people and it took some time to get to them to complete the order all while we were made to wait. This is ridiculous! I understand if they would have gone to another bar outside, but we could literally see them, they were a few steps away, the hostesses were holding their ground. They made us wait double time. WOW.  Dinner: We are already tired from the hostesses attitude so the tone wasn't set to be happy from the beginning, but we were celebrating and I was there to have a great time so I decided to take the waiters suggestion: The dish that MADE NOBU what it is which is the Black Cod Miso for $40.00, but I felt like it should be worth it. Black cod Miso, is made with like an eel sauce glaze-which I love. However, it tasted like they left the cod in the sake-miso marinade for about 3 days because the fish was completely salty. You could not taste the quality of the fish. in fact, you could not taste fish at all! If you hate fish and like to eat spoons of salt with no other flavor, this is the dish for you! A dish for 40.00 where star is the piece of fish-it better be good and it was the biggest disappointment I have ever had.   I also ordered 1 piece of the eel sushi and it didn't look like real Eel. It looked like paste shaped and colored to look like Eel. Not impressed.   The best thing here was the Edamame!   I'd say. If you really want to go in here, just get a drink and maybe Edamame or a simple sushi roll-those were good :)  There are tons of restaurants in Vegas. Save your money, do not come to this place!",

    "text": "On Saturday, I called this place to reserve a table for 5, but they said they didn't take reservations & that it was walk-in. My friends & I decided to dine here anyway before we went to XS. When we got there, the host says that it was an 1-1.5 hr wait & that we should've RSVP! I couldn't believe it! I told her about my call this morning, but all she said was that she was sorry for the miscommunication. My friends & I were hungry & irritated, but we decided to wait anyways because all restaurants probably had a long wait time since it was dinner time.   Before I start commenting on the food, please keep in mind that my friends & I are a huge fan of sushi & Japanese cuisine, so we've eaten at numerous sushi joints & had high hopes for this place since it was expensive & well-known.   I understand that sushi is an expensive experience overall, but this place was a big disappointment. We started off with a few cocktail drinks recommended by the waitress & some oyster shooters (yummy!). As for our dishes, we ordered the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno (fresh, but mediocre), which was recommended by our waitress as one of their signature dish. Next, we had the wagyu taco (meat was soft, but it came in two & was REALLY small). As for sushi & sashimi, we ordered the scallop sashimi & salmon belly - both of which are super overpriced for $6-7 per piece & the cut wasn't even that big, tuna cut (tiny & nothing special) & the house special ($17 for nothing special). The rock shrimp was just fried battered shrimp mixed in with spicy mayo. The only dish that was good was the black cod miso - had a sweet glazed taste.  Coming here, we've already expected to pay $100+/person, but we expected the food to be superb. Overall, this place is expensive for mediocre food that I could've eaten elsewhere for half the price. No thanks.",

Toro was $22/pc.; expensive and it's no better than what Benihana serves. A la carte grill we had like crab legs, wagyu, shrimp, scallop, lamb, foie gras were all decent. Again, just the food cost us about $250+/person, so I was hoping at least one item would wow me but none.   -2 stars for our server.  I wish I could remember his name. That night he served our teppan table and another party sitting next to us. Water glasses and tea cups went empty a few times and had to ask for refill, but this didn't bother me as much as the fact that each refill took 10 minutes to happen (not to mention the server sent busboy to assist us). I saw our server attended the other table frequently, pouring sake (which we ordered a large bottle as well), refilling their tea/water,  and checking on them on the food. Perhaps the server didn't find us fun enough to be around, but we did enjoy our chef and we tipped him well after cooking for us. The server only came by when we asked for the bill and spoke to us FINALLY when he thought we didn't give any gratuity. Honestly, I really didn't think he deserves a penny. The tips we left were for the busboys who served us the entire night.  The food we had at other Nobu's such as Malibu didn't wow us either, but we had a great server and made us feel welcomed. Our dining experience here did not meet any expectation, and I hope it was an isolated incident. But overall the food does not worth $$$$ and with such pricing, there are plentiful options elsewhere in Vegas.",

    "text": "Over-rated and underwhelming. I understand Nobu has the name and is trendy, but it honestly falls flat. The sushi rolls are flavorless, taste dry, and are small portions for the price. The black cod didn't fall a part easily- it was actually firm. The prices are just ridiculous for what you get. I'm shocked and very disappointed. There are so many great restaurants in vegas and to waste a night, money and calories on this dinner is a shame. The waiter wasn't apologetic that we didn't enjoy our meal. He just kept defending the quality and making us believe we were wrong. I live in LA and have had some of the best sushi- fresh and flavorful. I've had better luck at a hole in the wall for a fraction of the price. This menu needs a facelift, new flavor profile, fresher fish, and better presentation for the price. I rather go to Zuma at Cosmo! That's a memorable  sushi dinner in Vegas!",

The issue was that we were spending quite a lot, and the food was subpar at best.  We mentioned this to the manager and he didn't seem very supportive. We even mentioned for him to try the food coming out of the kitchen, but again, there wasn't much support.  It's unfortunate that we had an experience like this, because we were looking to have a great experience and were let down considerably.",

    "text": "This is my first time visiting any Nobu locations, and unfortunately didn't get to try as much as I had hoped to (for various reasons) so this review will primarily be regarding the service, although I will talk a little about what I ate.  My friend and I had intended to have dinner here before going to see Britney Spears, but it was a somewhat last minute decision so called around 5:30 pm to see how busy they would be at 7:00 pm. The hostess on the phone was rude and could not give me the slightest estimate on what the anticipated wait time for a 7pm on Saturday was. She quickly rushed me off the phone.   We decided to try and go anyway, so we arrived and (I assume the same hostess) was SO RUDE. We were asking questions about wait times for seating at the bar and the sushi bar and she acted as if she did not want to give us the time of day. The wait for the sushi bar was 20 min so we decided to wait and grab a drink at the bar.   Things got better. We ordered drinks and immediately a hostess arrived to take us to the sushi bar, so the bartender brought the drinks over to us. She was super nice, helpful, and the drinks were great (although it is difficult to mess up a dirty martini).   The first sushi chef we had was quick and friendly, but not very chatty. We only ordered a few rolls because we were somewhat in a rush. I highly recommend the soft shell crab! The second chef we had was friendlier and funny. Our waiter was pleasant and attentive, however mostly unremarkable.   From what I've heard about Nobu, I expected a better experience. It wasn't terrible, and I will update the review when I am able to go try more of the food selection, but I also didn't expect my best experience there to be with the bartender. The lower rating is attributed to what I experienced versus my expectations for Nobu.",

We loved: Yellowtail sashimi with jalepeno, Rock shrimp tempura, Artichoke salad, Shaved ice coconut dessert, Soft-shell crab roll We liked: Squid pasta, Black cod miso  I just found out that they are opening a new Nobu near us in Newport Beach and cannot wait until they open this Fall.

Certainly not the best or most authentic Japanese food I've ever had (especially after spending a year in Japan), but creative and most certainly tasty. Our neighbors at the bar were very friendly and we all got to cheer against Miami heat together--no better bonding experience.   The bartender was also extremely nice and my drink (the sakura.. something) was quite potent. Sipping on one drink lasted me all through dinner.   We ordered the yellowtail w/jalapenos (or something like that, a cold dish, it was good), rock shrimp, and crab tempura. We also got sweet shrimp with fried heads and some ikura for sashimi. Next time I would skip either the rock shrimp or crab tempura since both were fried and I didn't realize it at the time of ordering.   Overall a solid meal with some fun new friends.",

I strongly recommend going the \"Omakase\" route where you give the server a general sense of what you like, and a target price point per person for the meal and let him or her select the courses for you.  I've done that here twice before and both times the experience was remarkable and the selections much better than anything I could have come up with on my own.  Highly recommended!",

The customized offerings were delicious but that miso glazed sea bass might go down as the dish you want as your inevitable last meal it was done to such perfection.  Slightly caramelized at the very edges with a bit more texture than the velvety sweet bites of the rest of the dish was heavenly, and we almost ordered a second plate .",

Before we made the reservation, I consulted not only with the hip hop moguls but also my stepdad who is a fan. Nobu didn't disappoint. We were two couples celebrating a baby on the way and a wedding on the way. We had Columbia as our waiter and he was beyond phenomenal. Seriously- I would request him again. We did the dining experience where we gave our likes and dislikes and price point per person. I can't keep saying how incredible it was. We were all amazed and in heaven with this food. Since I'm pregnant, i didn't enjoy the drinks like my table mates did but my mocktail was refreshing. Anyway, do yourself a favor and make a reservation here to treat yourself and don't feel bad about the bill. It's worth it.",

    "text": "From a Celiac:  I have been to this location about 30 times in the last few years. We have always ordered the same thing: 10 tacos each then share rice and plain seabass. I am now completely following my Celiac diet which changed up my last time to Nobu significantly.  I'd have to say this was one of my favorite meals of all time.  We have now moved into the bar area, in a nest, instead of in the main dining room, which I hate. The decorations look like something cheap from Zurchers, and the booths make it feel like you're sitting in a cafeteria.  Anyway. This time, in a nest, in the bar area, we had Johnathan. This guy was FANTASTIC! I told him my new diet and he hooked me up with the best food ever. He had me try the New Style with Scallops with gluten free sauce. It was so amazing I refused to even share with the boyfriend. I made him eat his own tacos. Then I had the seabass, as it is prepared there with the sweeter sauce. Also amazing. Then... my favorite with the black cod miso prepared gluten free in lettuce cups. Those pieces just melted in my mouth. I wanted to go back the second night, but went to Jardin instead (huge mistake, that was horrific).   I really wish this location would get a better wine menu. That is a huge complaint of mine. It's worse than some of the restaurants in Utah- and they have the worse wine lists. I honestly don't like any of the Chardonnay, but I did get the Pouilly Fuisse and that was actually the perfect pairing.   All in all, totally my new favorite Celiac friendly restaurant in Vegas!",

We chose to sit at the Sushi Bar....MISTAKE.   The bartender (male) was obviously very busy and they appeared to be short staffed. It wasn't until midway through the meal did the manager or superior start to assist with the bar crowd. The bartender was very abrupt with us regarding our questions about specials or menu items. We were very specific in our order and he did not right it down. It then came out wrong and the bartender processed to argue that we had not ordered what we received. This created an awkward feel so we ate, paid the check and went to another restaurant for the rest of dinner.   The restaurant is beautiful and the staff seemed nice, but this was certainly not the experience we expected for the price point $$$$$. With all of the options Vegas has to offer, I will likely not return. -NPR",

It's vegas so it's obviously super busy, but our server was very knowledgeable regarding the menu. Not to mention friendly and stopped few times to chat. I like how the restaurant offered half bottle of wine, perfect for a couple who wants about 2 glasses each. Our reservation was initially at 830pm and I mixed up the time and arrived one hour before- and surprisingly was not turned away and was seated almost immediately. Nice music, the tables were well spaced out so we didn't hear other people's conversations. The booth was comfortable. Everyone time customers walk in the staff chime together and believe they all say \"Welcome!\" Of course in Japanese, huge guess but either way fun to hear. All servers wearing black and they truly are professional and meticulous when setting up tables and delivering food. The black cod was fantastic, soft white meat with delicious sauce. Tasmanian ocean trout was a nice surprise to see on the menu, well prepared with the skin nice and crispy just like I like it! The yellowtail/scallion sushi roll was simple but super fresh. Appreciated having a bathroom in the restaurant a lot of times you have to roam around the casino. Our server mentioned Nobu has a beautiful location in San Diego, would love to explore that location next. Delicious meal and great service. Highly recommend Nobu! Will not be disappointed just make sure you have your credit card ready$$$.",

I ordered the Nobu sidecar whiskey cocktail which was a perfect way to start the meal.  They served the cold dishes first, and unlike the other omakase meals there wasn't a pallet cleanser and neither was there a soup.  All things aside it was the wonderful meal as you would expect for $250 a head.  The A5 Kobe beef served over hot stones was excellent as well as the sea bass.  All the dishes from the sushi chef were amazing as well. Not a punch my wallet can take too often, but a great meal to wrap up a great trip to Vegas.",

Sarika, our server, was attentive, knowledgeable, and totally on top of everything.  Neither of us had dined at a Nobu before, so outside of our knowledge of standard sushi rolls, this was a completely new culinary experience for us.  Sarika guided us with everything, accommodated our dietary restrictions, and ensured we stuck to our budget and time (we wanted to thoroughly enjoy our dinner but also had a show to catch afterward).   The food was absolutely delicious, and the cucumber martini was the perfect accompaniment - all of the seafood was so fresh, the sequence of dishes presented was perfectly balanced, and we left super full (which can be tough to do when it comes to tasting menus/tapas style menus).   The service was also incredible.  Sarika was the best, but so were the several other people who ensured every detail was accounted for from the moment we arrived to the moment we left.   For anyone looking to celebrate a special occasion or just a reason to splurge, Nobu will NOT disappoint!!",

Do the omakase and get the full experience. We did the omakase $225 a person and honestly thought it was worth it. The quality of the fish and the different flavors were amazing. Their seared wagyu beef and foie gras miso soup was delicious. The service was also wonderful and each dish was described in detail. I would definitely come back and try it again since they change their omakase every so often. If you want to get your money's worth, omakase all the way.",

    "text": "Overall great experience, emphasis on the experience.  Menu is $$$$ so be prepared to drop some coin.  The ambiance is loud - even for a casino.  I wasn't completely impressed with the food, especially for the price point.    Appetizers: Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar ($48) - The boyfriend absolutely loved this.  It was his favorite part of the meal.  I'm not a fan of caviar, so I wasn't a fan of the appetizer, naturally.  Nobu Style Tacos ($6 - $14, minimum 2) -  We chose tuna & king crab.  The tacos are about the size of an egg, but the tuna taco was AMAZING.  I could have ordered a dozen.  Big Eye Tuna Tataki with Tosazu ($28) - Nothing special.  Same tuna tataki as every other sushi joint.  Hearts of Palm salad ($24) - This was refreshing.  You don't see hearts of palm much on menus, and it was a great starter to the meal.  At this point, I saw a table of 9 being seated behind us in our waiters section, and I had a feeling the service might decline.  I was right. :-/  Some tables around us ordered a dish that was lit on fire when served, and I had to know what it was.  Our server explained it was the Wagyu grilled steak, the most sought after beef in the world.  Priced $38/oz, with a minimum 6oz order ($228).  I HAD to try it, and with reassurance from the boyfriend, the waiter placed my order.  (Side note on the gender bias... Is it such a crazy concept that I was paying for the meal?  Why did he need the male approval??)  The presentation was spectacular.  The steak is brought out on 3 hot stones & they light it on fire table side.  Quite a show!  Hands down best steak I have ever had.  (All 3 bites of it!)    The waiter said Nobu isn't known for their sushi, but that it is excellent.  We decided to make this our main course.  Yellowtail and Jalapeno cut roll ($12) - I thought this was excellent.  VERY spicy!  The boyfriend absolutely detests cilantro & at the beginning of the meal, the waiter specifically asked if we had any allergies or dislikes.  We mentioned the cilantro, and he assured us our meal would be cilantro-free.  Not the case with this roll unfortunately.  I don't know why he would ask if he wasn't going to follow through.  Toro (Blue Fin) and Scallion cut roll ($16) - Nothing special, just a normal sushi roll.  Tuna (Big Eye) with avocado cut roll ($12) - Again, nothing special.  Just another roll.  We also ordered 1 piece of sashimi that wasn't on the menu the waiter recommended.  It was a slice of Blue Fin that is aged 14 days in an air tight, refrigerated cedar box.  The waiter forgot to order it, so we had to remind him after all the other rolls had come & gone.  Again, nothing special, just another piece of sashimi.  ($14)  Overall, the food was average.  Certainly not what I was expecting for a $500 meal.  (Even for Vegas)  The service really wasn't up to par for an upscale restaurant either.  I am thankful for the experience, but we most likely will not return.  We'll try something new next time instead.",

I have made reservations and ate in the main dining room, however I prefer sitting at the sushi counter which is usually available by Walk in.   Best Rolls we have had are when we keep an open mind and ask the sushi chef to prepare his favorite.   I crave the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalepeno. They drizzle a citrus sauce on it that is to-die-for.  If you can sit on the far end of the sushi counter from the entrance, you may get the added entertainment of watching the Hibachi Chefs prepare at the private party Hibachi tables.  Good selection of unique cocktails, my favorite is the Lychee Martini.  I live in Seattle which has good sushi options but the best Sushi/Sashimi I have ever had is at Nobu. And the the fun and beautiful environment makes it a special experience.  I have been to Nobu at Ceasars 4 times in the past year and never been disappointed.",

    "text": "Great experience. A bit overpriced but very well prepared and presented food. Quite light overall and lots of attention to detail.   This was our first meal in Vegas and it did not disappoint. We couldn't get in until 10:30 but had some appetizers at Gordon Ramsay's next door (also delicious). We didn't really know what to get but the server was very helpful and made suggestions that we ended up going with.   As mentioned in many reviews, the yellowfin with jalapeno is very good. We also had a king crab ceviche, scallops on chips, and a salmon sashimi dish. One of my friends doesn't really like raw fish and she enjoyed many of the things she tried. In addition to these starters, we also shared a grilled beef dish as well as the signature cod dish. It was good but I wouldn't call it amazing... It has a nice sweet flavour but wasn't anything particularly special.   For dessert, we got the bento box which has a floury chocolate cake and ice cream on the side. Very good. For drinks, we got sake which is the perfect pairing with these delicate dishes. Wine would have been overpowering and the sake is a great palate cleanser.   I enjoyed my experience here but I don't think I could justify coming back. It was fun and nice to try a lot of things but it was a bit expensive given the portion sizes. I didn't come out hungry but for over $100 a person I think we could have done better. Definitely worth a try, though, as the food is very good and not your typical Japanese restaurant.",

    "text": "Hands down Nobu became my FAVORITE restaurant in the whole world!!! I'm not even kidding or exaggerating.   I don't really write reviews but I have to for this one. Ever since we finished eating here, I can't stop thinking about this place.   This restaurant is interesting and very high end. You can either order straight off the menu or go with the tasting menu where they chose and pick which dish you should try based on your preferences and budget. We spent $80 a person and got to try about 10 items (not sure if this was discounted or not because we had connections). These items are a la carte and are served in very small portions. I loved how they came out with the dish one by one and fully explained what the dish was or how it was cooked, etc. They even served us some dishes that weren't even in the menu.   Everything I tried was SO delicious. I was never disappointed and no dish was just \"ok\".  However I did have my favorites: yellowtail sashimi, black cod miso, and the truffle spinach salad. I have a favorite sashimi spot in San Diego and Nobu definitely tops it!   Customer service was excellent! However our server assumed we didn't want dessert because we said we were full. Ambiance, environment, and everything else was beyond excellent as well!   There has always been a Nobu in San Diego but never been there! I'm definitely going to try it and we'll see if it'll be the same. I'm going to take my fiance here one day even though he doesn't like sashimi. Maybe Nobu can change his mind!  I will definitely, definitely come back!!! Thank you, Nobu for ending my Bachelorette Party weekend fantastic!",

I really was expecting a wow for a \"chef-driven\" $175 per person meal. It was good, but not 5-star. I am interested in trying other Nobu locations to compare the quality and experience. Really, I could have made a better meal at home. Skip the toro sushi. 3 stars only because Amber was great, but I really think the meal was a let down for the price point. If it was priced in proportion to the taste, I would have given a higher rating.  Also, I didn't like the candle on the birthday dessert. I've seen way nicer, 100% beeswax candles at other restaurants. Even whole foods has nicer candles than the standard birthday candle they used in the dessert. For a $1000 meal, I expected more detail than an inexpensive, probably grocery store bought candle. Okay, my rant is done. I know it's only a candle, but I care about the details and I think Nobu can do better! (:",

    "text": "Wowed by Nobu. Everything was super fresh, beautifully prepared and delicious.   Great drink selection. Started with the pina tini. Vodka, pineapple and lime. It was SO good! Not too sweet, perfectly strong. Just right.   Next up, their signature black cod miso. Holy moly it was like no other piece of fish I've had. Flaky. The flavor. Omg. A must try!   New style sashimi next. Salmon was to die for. Thinly sliced salmon with just a touch of some sort of sauce and green onion. So fresh. I inhaled it. Unbelievable.   I tried the rock shrimp, both spicy and mild version. Very tasty, but not earth shattering. The scallop roll was insanely hot with jalapeno, wasn't wowed with that. And the California roll was just ok.   Their rolls are nothing to write home about. Stick with their signature hot and cold dishes and share. Love the detail and freshness of everything here and the vibe. Will be back!",

You are paying for the AMAZING sauces and the fresh fish. They were delicious for sure.  I ordered a tuna and asparagus hand roll and a piece of unagi. Others at my table ordered the beef and the seafood steaming plate (I forget the Japanese name). The seafood was so fresh and delicious.  We shared a dessert which was plenty and paired our dinner with a wonderful CA sauvignon blanc.  I would recommend this place as a splurge to dress up and taste some very fresh and delicate plates. This was great for a business dinner, would be for a date or a group.  Great mood lighting.",

This is an overpriced, low-quality, fancy Panda Express (sorry Panda no offense) restaurant and I have dined at plenty of good restaurants in LV, including Gordon Ramsey Steak, Bazaar Meat, Cut, Fleur, Bouchon, etc.  We came to Nobu with high expectations and ordered quite a few items between me and my friend who came from overseas to visit.  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno -- Very sour and sweet, and the ponzu sauce completely overpowered the yellowtail.  Spicy Miso Chips with Scallops -- ok.  Kumamoto Oyster with Nobu Sauce -- ponzu sauce again.... really?   Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy -- tasted like bar food, nothing special, yeah, the sauce was sweet.  Black Cod Miso -- another sweet dish, omg.  Uni sushi -- not fresh, the uni tasted blend.  Yellowtail belly sushi -- ok.  Toro handroll & Spicy yellowtail handroll -- i found tendon inside my toro handroll, I ordered a toro handroll not a \"leftover fish handroll\"  Our waiter was attentive and nice initially.  However when we expressed our disappointment because all the dishes were sweet and soaked into ponzu sauce, he immediately changed his attitude 180 degrees.  He made us feel like it was our fault in ordering the wrong items!  In stead of turning our disappointment into a memorable experience, the waiter said, \" you should tell me you guys prefer the savory dishes, not sweet dishes.,\" Well, I'm sorry, Mr Waiter, we chose the dishes from the main menu, not the dessert menu. We simply didn't expect most of the dishes to be on the sweet side.   How does one come to expect miso, nobu sauce, cream spicy sauce to be all made out of the same ponzu sauce? Is this the Nobu experience??!?!?!  Dinner at Nobu was my suggestion for my dear friend from afar and i was ashamed of my poor choice.",

I was super stoked to try this place, but I was pretty disappointed with the meal.   Recap: 1. Decor/Atmosphere - Very nice. Back when I was young and single, I totally would have rolled up to this place to impress my now-wife. Swanky decorations that oozes class, balla', and sophistication.   2. Food - Quality of the food is good. I feel like they use very expensive, high-end ingredients, but the food wasn't executed very well. Nothing that we ordered really \"Wow'ed\" me.   3. Drinks - Delicious! The drinks here are very good, but will set you back $15 bucks/drink.   4. Price - No bueno. The food was hella expensive for what you get. If I got a little more for my money or if the food was outstanding, I would be okay spending money here. But to spend an arm and leg on mediocre food broke my heart.   5. Baby Friendly - Not really. Yes, they did have high chairs, but no changing tables in the men's room.   6. Staff - Phenomenal service. I think we had 3-4 servers running food and tending to us. Knowledgeable about the food and made some decent recommendations.   Overall, I had a good time here. I probably wouldn't be back because of the prices/portions, but I'm glad I checked this place off my bucket list.",

We even had a few people with us who thought they were anti sushi.. they left happy and full! Best parts... the salmon dish... and the lobster..  Let it be known.. it is pricey.. but the food is well worth every dollar!   Few things to note.. tall people do not fit at the low table well Bc there is no where to put your legs. I wish the waiter was a little friendlier... when you are staying there for 3 hours and eating the most expensive selection on the menu I would of liked the waiter to introduce himself.",

For the first course I ordered the miso soup which was a pleasant surprise; it was very flavorful and tasty compared the the salt water flavored miso i've had in the past.  Next I had the black cod which is their best selling dish and it was so good! Must try if it's your first time at Nobu, the Nobu style fish and chips were very good and had a light lemon flavor which really went well with the sauce.   Last of all I had the sushi which is the only reason this review isn't 5*s, It was bland and really nothing special which I disappointed about. The California roll's snow crab was flavorless and the roll tasted mostly of cucumber. The yellow tail scallion roll had a similar issue except the scallion was all you could taste, I was expecting more from a place like Nobu and was really underwhelmed.",

First of all, they charged me for more waygu steak than we actually had--the reason I know this is because I took a video of the steak being lit on fire on the rocks). Also, when I ordered a bottle of wine I thought it was the cheapest on the red wine menu and I told our waiter that, however, somehow I got a $330.00 bottle of wine. He asked why I chose that wine and I said it was because that was the cheapest. Why did he not correct me? At the beginning of dinner we were looking at the chef special priced around $300 each--which we were more than willing to spend, we are foodies and we have no problem spending money on good food. After speaking to our waiter though, he persuaded us to go with a menu that the chef would put together for us. He said that we would get more \"bang for our buck\" and we would get to try more of the menu. He asked us questions and depending on our preferences--that is how the meal was created. Since he said we would get more bang for our buck, we went with this option rather than the $300 chef special. BIG MISTAKE. After a beautiful dinner, we got a bill of $1,300.00. Yes you read that right, $1,300.00 FOR ME AND MY MOTHER. I was full, but not thirteen hundred dollars full. I will never be going back to Nobu and feel we have been totally taken advantage of.",

    "text": "I was really excited for my reservation at Nobu during my last trip to Vegas.  I eat sushi about three times a week, and I was amped to eat the best of the best!    I was sat at the sushi bar.  It took over 15 minutes for anyone to come and give me a menu, and then I was left again for an absurd amount of time before my drink order was taken.  The \"supervisor\" at the sushi bar kept having to pull random waiters to come take my order throughout the night.  Needless to say, the service left much to be desired, although I will say all the waiters, when they did eventually come,  were very nice.  The next disappointment was the fact that I ordered a sashimi platter.  I expected a beautiful plate of fresh fish that tasted as good as it looked.  Honestly, the presentation was nothing beyond anything I would get here in Chicago, and the taste was fine, but definitely not anything I would put above my other favorite sushi restaurants.    Struggling with the fact I was not satisfied with my sashimi, I ordered the mushroom soup.  That was very good with many different earthy mushrooms in a clear broth.  I did like this.  Still not sent over the moon though, I asked the waiter for a recommendation for a hot dish.  He recommended the king crab tempura.  It was good, however the sauce was extremely overbearing with acidity and it is presented that the crab is sitting in the sauce so there is not much control over how much you can use.    Overall, I was disappointed with not only the food I received, but it was extremely overpriced.  Not to mention I spent way more than I intended just trying to find something to make my experience what I expected!  Maybe I ordered wrong, or I caught them on a bad night, but this is the taste I was left with.",

I needed a quick trip home for 10 days to settle some business in the area as I live bicoastal  Las Vegas and New Jersey I'm not as crazy about sushi on the east coast as I am on the west coast so usually when I'm home me and my friends always gather for brunch in sushi or happy hour that's just what we do there's always food involved My parents have a diamond card and gave it to me so I had rented a room for the last four nights that I was at the hotel and on my last day I went and I got some sushi by myself and finally checked out this new location there is another one inside the hard rock I have been to that location to times and the Noble in Malibu several times To be honest I think this was my favourite one I don't know if it was because I was alone or just because it happened to work out so well I was in a very happy mood I had some deals going on with real estate and everything was going well. Buying and selling so I was kind of celebrating I was able to get some champagne that I liked and just sat by myself and I ordered two specific roles and they gave me free saki.  I was waited on fairly quickly and seeded quickly with just the walking but I looked pretty nice  I did take me a bit to get my check because they started to get busy and I needed to catch a plane I wasn't even sure how much my bill was I fled down the first person that I could find and told them to get my server and couldn't wait any longer so I just left a $50 bill on the table and ran to the Bellmon for my luggage because my driver had arrived to take me to the airport I will often wonder if I owe them money or not but I think I took care of it I really didn't order much  I will say that this particular Noble is definitely better than the one in Malibu in the one in the hard rock nearby it's just down the street",

It's the kind of place where you're really glad you got to go, but I know I couldn't afford to be a regular there.....just to glad to have had the experience.

My whole party opted-in for Chef's daily creation omakase ($175). It includes items not listed on the menu consisting cold dishes as starters, hot dishes from the grill, soup and nigiri. An alternative omakase will be the Nobu's selection for ($125)... this one, you won't be able to try the daily chef's special. Since we're in Las Vegas... I lived by the motto \"Go Big or Go Home!\". So, without any regrets... $175 it is!  If you refer to my pictures, those are the items served to me that night. Everything was blasting with flavors I've never tried elsewhere. I was blown away.   The omakase already comes with dessert, but we decided to add the shaved ice for all of us to share. It is huge and definitely enough to share among the 7 of us.  Besides the food, the cocktail menu has pretty good mixtures of alcohol and ingredients. I got to the try Grapefruit on the Rocks and Sidecar. Both are very good! And of course being a restaurant that serves alcohol, they have wine, beer, and hard liquor as well.  Totally would recommend this place to anyone. I know they have other locations also so wherever you are... if you see a Nobu... GET IN THERE!",

The menu has so many choices, it makes it VERY HARD to order and then you hope what you ordered is the right size fr the party size. The service is severely lacking, for these prices, I would expect the servers to smile, maybe even levitate.  Plenty of other sushi joints with just as good quality in Vegas. Mr Nobu would be rolling over in his grave, if he was actually dead, which he is not.",

My husband and I love sushi, so we thought this would be a real treat since it's hyped to be the \"best sushi ever\". We were left really unimpressed. The rolls we ordered we good, but not special in any way. I wasn't blown out of the water. We also got some skewers, beef and shrimp with the sauce that wasn't teriyaki. The sauce was good, and I did enjoy the shrimp, but again it didn't seem special. Nothing to write home about. Aside from the subpar food, what left a sour taste in our mouths was also that they had asked us if we were celebrating anything when we booked the reservation, and I said it was my husband's 30th birthday. Nothing was done for us at all, the waiter said \"oh and happy birthday\" when bringing back our check after already taking our card. I definitely don't expect singing, since it's a fancier place but no small single person serving dessert? Like they can't afford that? What's the point in asking what we are celebrating if they don't do anything? Also a $3 fee for a side of spicy mayo, which seems weird but ok. I felt like we were treated poorly since we weren't ordering alcohol and stuck with water, they acted like we couldn't afford to be there or something from the moment we said we were fine with water. Overall, I wouldn't be back and don't understand the hype at all.",

Luckily, I have been in Vegas for work, so have had the opportunity to try some great restaurants.  So far, Nobu may have been the most expensive, but also the most delicious!  We opted to let the server make the menu for us and gave him a price point.  We went with about $100 - $125 per person, and we were all blown away.  I don't know what most of the dishes were called because we let the waiter pick.  However, I will describe the hightlights.  1) Favorite dish was the Miso Cod.  I'm not sure what Chef Nobu does to make it better than all of the other Cod dished I have had, but it was amazing.  This dish just melted on my mouth.  2) There was a raw whitefish with some chili powder flavor on it.  It was what we started with and was delicious  3) Seared Salmon Belly was also awesome.  It was tender and the sauce it was paired with was great  4) Dessert was a shave ice bowl with green beens, mochi, and other flavors.  It was a bit sweet, but also really good.  The only thing that I was not crazy about was the sushi selection.  There were 2 rolls that came, that I did not particularly enjoy.  The lobster roll was nothing fancy, and the nobu roll was a bit too \"fishy' of a taste.  The Tuna sushi was really good, as was the seared salmon sushi.    Overall, a great meal with great service.  The price was a little much, and for me I felt it was a little excessive.  Definitely a 5 star evening.",

I have been to Nobu in Malibu, California which had amazing service so I was expecting the same but unfortunately I did not have the same experience here.  Food Recommendations:  1.) YellowTail Sashimi with Jalapenos ($28) in Yuzu sauce. This is by far the freshest and best tasting yellowtail I have ever eaten! The Yuzu sauce is quite zesty, the jalapeno adds a little kick of spice and the yellowtail sort of just melts in your mouth.  2.) Rock Shrimp ($24) available in Creamy Spicy, Butter Ponzu or Jalapeno. We ordered all three bit fell in love with the creamy spicy! The only way I can explain this to you is like Shrimp Tempura meets Walnut Shrimp in heaven and had a baby! This is a must try! 3.) Wagyu Beef ($26 per ounce- 2 ounce minimum) choice of Hibachi (grilled- seared quickly served with dipping sauces), Shabu Shabu (meat submerged in a pot of dashi) or sukiyaki (slowly simmered in an iron pot). No matter how you cook it this meat is top grade, tender and amazing. 4.) Chilean Seabass ($48)- although it's not the best Seabass on the strip (Noodles at Bellagio) it's cooked comparable well here.  *The cocktails are amazing*- just be prepared to wait 30minutes to get your first one.",

The waiter immediately suggested that he bring out two (2) dishes of his choice as an appetizer without showing us a menu.  I was versed in one of the appetizers from my own research and agreed to it.  Our waiter began by explaining the \"eating experience\" at Nobu insisting that we remove the menus that the restaurant prints and give him a price point so that he could begin the experience.  Having read multiple reviews about the restaurant I was prepared for this tactic and explained that we were not heavy eaters (True) and we preferred to review the menu.  He again suggested that a name a price point so that he could give us an experience, I told him $100/person.  The waiter stated that we could not get the experience for that price, I suggested he show us a menu so that I could choose my own experience.  The waiter returned and took our order, he made two (2) suggestions in lieu of what we wanted.  We took him up on one of his suggestions.  After taking our order, the waiter suggested we order more because he was concerned we would still be hungry.  I informed him that I could make that determination after we ate our meal.    The food was amazing and artful.  Our waiter lost interest in us after learning that we were not going to give him free reign for an experience.  We shared the shaved ice for desert (it was my birthday and my wife arranged that the chef put a birthday message on the plate).  The shaved ice was just ok.  The message is the food is amazing (5 Star Amazing) but the staff (2 Stars for being rude and pushy) is trained in sale tactics and up selling people (everything the waiter offered was the highest price point in each category).  If you want to enjoy your own experience, take the menu into your own hands.  We had a great food experience for a price point that we were comfortable with and left full, despite our waiters concern.",

    "text": "The food and service were not worthy of a $$$$ price tag. The glowing reviews of this place led me to book it for my boyfriend's birthday but it was seriously the most overpriced food and worst service I experienced in Vegas. I regret the decision to come here so much.   1. Tuna Miso Chips. This was a slice of raw tuna served on what equated to a not so crispy waffle cut potato chip garnished with some greens and a sauce that did not go well with the tuna.  2. Miso Black Cod. This was the LEAST worth it dish of all. Everyone raves about this dish and I was expecting a nice sized piece of black cod but what I got were 4 TINY appetizer bites. The cod was good but why serve this on a random bed of butter lettuce garnished with the same white noodles in the center as the tuna miso chips. Serious lack of creativity.  3. Hamachi Kama. This was the best dish of all four but that is not saying much. The fish was at least tender.  4. Joyce Farms Chicken. The chicken was tender on this but I did not like the sauce.  5. Dessert. After the fails above, did you think I was going to be stupid and order dessert?  Don't come here expecting good food or good service. The server would ask us how the food was and before we could answer he had already turned his back on us to talk to the table right next to us. This place is a joke. The Chef Nobu name does not mean anything here. I cannot believe so many people think this place is amazing.  Have you ever gone somewhere and wished you didn't? Nobu was one of those places for me.",

    "text": "Even though our reservations time was 5:30, our stomachs were still on east coast time, and I'm glad we went at this hour.  There were no lines, the restaurant was quiet, and we had an army of attentive servers doing their patrols to clear empty plates and refill drinks.  The service here is amazing, and when the place is emptier, you can really take your time and appreciate everything without feeling rushed, or crowded.  The hamachi-jalapeno appetizer was fantastic, although a little pricey.  At $30, it's half the price of an entire entree, but I'm glad we got it because it really shows off the skills of the chefs.  The balance of everything was perfect, and after tasting it, we knew our dinner would be great.  I usually do a-la-carte sashimi at sushi restaurants, but here, we decided to let the chef decide for us.  We got the sashimi dinner and the sashimi deluxe dinner.  They brought it out all on the same plate, so it was beautiful all together.  Both dishes were 12-15 pieces, but the deluxe came with better cuts of fish.  We got 3 pieces of Bluefin otoro with ours, but YMMV.  As a sushi snob, I always get fresh wasabi, but it which comes with the deluxe dinner - so make sure you don't order it twice - unless you need extra wasabi.  I had the flour-less chocolate cake and the green tea ice cream, which was called the bento box.  Both were delicious, and recommended by the waiter.  The green tea ice cream was very green-tea-y, which was perfect with the warm chocolate cake.  The only thing that was disappointing was the green tea.  It was very watered down, but you can't knock this place down a star for bad tea.  Do yourself a favor and make sure this is one of your first meals in Vegas.  It'll save you from even looking at buffet sushi later on.  Definitely a must-eat in Vegas.",

The Yellowtail dish, along with the scallops dish was delicious. The Miso  Glazed Cod was so buttery. The Sashimi Salad was very flavorful. The New Style Salmon & White fish had Sesame Oil Flavor which if your a fan of the fresh or citrus taste...I would not recommend this for you. The oil could be a little powerful for you. I ordered the signature drink Mango Passion Martini. It was not overly sweet but very smooth. We took the recommendation of Jonathan's on the dessert, which was a Miso Tart & boy did he not fail us.  This taste of like a salted caramel cheesecake was over the top. I must say...the place is very pricey but you only live once so this is definitely something everyone should try.",

The food was good but again I don't think the prices matched the food, we have been to very good restaurants and again this one was good but not OUTSTANDING.

    "text": "Nobu is a very Vegas appropriate dining experience.  The menu has the huge caviar and also fresh cuts of nigiri for those looking to splurge. The rest of the menu is a well curated menu of a mixture of Latin and Japanese with some ceviche and dipping/chip items as well as classic seafood and tempura. Coming on a Friday night without a reservation was bold as the place was packed, but we found some room at the bar and dined there. The waiter gave us the low down on their famous dishes and the menu in genera and we were off.   The beer menu is pretty much Japanese through and through. Mostly lager but a few Hefeweizen as well. Prices were high at $9+ regardless of Draught or bottle. The cocktails were reasonable at $17. I had the Japanese old fashioned which came premade and barrel aged. Super strong and boozy but a nice rendition. I would order that again as it fit very nicely with their menu as a whole.   For food we tried a few entrees and an appetizer. We began with a quick tamago by were disappointed. Looks cool with the 'Nobu' charred into the top, but more of a cake than any egg flavor. The appetizer we went with was the classic sticky rice. Supremely innovative dish with dippable sticky rice cubes topped with salmon. 10/10 would order this again. Couple this with housemade hot sauce and it was a winner. Waiter didn't tell us how to eat this dish in the beginning though, as there is a certain way to indulge, so make sure to get the 411 before chowing down. The sea bass with miso was good not great. Miso is their specialty so we had to order it. The fish was outstanding and thick and flaky. The sauce was just too heavy on the yuzu which took away from the flavor of the fish. But still a very nice entree. The king crab tempura (recommended by waiter) was not as expected. Typical of most lower end Japanese establishments you expect a large full on crab with deep fried legs and whatnot. This came precut with the crab meat lightly battered and in a bowl of tempura sauce and some onion that was more of a ceviche than a classic tempura. The crab was absolutely phenomenal and thick. This dish was a great order and the tempura cooked heavenly with just a. Soft fry to make it more enjoyable to eat without he overpowering crunch.   Nobu impressed me. Definitely worth it to get a reservation as it seems to always be packed whenever I walk by.  Stick to the actual Nobu menu and stay away from the sushi and high end extras that are just there for those looking for a sushi restaurant on the strip. Go to their main menu and let the waiter push you towards a delicious dining experience.",

The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't quite up to the standard that I was expecting.  There was a noticeable discrepancy between what we had experienced at the Malibu location and Vegas.

After eating small plates of samples which were called meals I wanted to throw back up all my food seeing the bill. When we went to Las Vegas we expected the food to be expensive but not this expensive.   However, I cannot deny the amazing service and polite toned waitress and waiters. I did enjoy the food very much but if you have a big appetite I would not recommend. The food comes in bite size portions but it very clean and smooth. From the sushi to soups were crazy good.

    "text": "I've been to Nobu at this particular location a couple times... but my most recent visit was the least pleasurable one.   Don't get me wrong, the food -- amazing! Everything is so elegantly displayed when brought to you (as done at most high-end restaurants.) But what was annoying about this visit was my waiter... and the quality of the mochi ice cream I ordered for myself.  If I'm paying $400 for a meal, I feel like I shouldn't get mocked for my spice endurance (especially when asking about how spicy a cocktail is because I've never tried it), as well as argued with over what I did and didn't order(?)  I understand that the guy was probably trying to be funny about my spice endurance, but it just came off snobbish. Speaking of more snobbery, I ordered two desserts -- one for me, and one for my friend (who I was taking out for her birthday.) The first dessert (hers) arrives, and we're just sitting there waiting for my dessert. I mean it was getting dead at that point, and so of course I stopped my waiter and I asked him about my dessert to which he replied, \"Oh, you didn't order that dessert,\" to which I replied  \"Oh(?), well can you put that in(?),\" as if he were expecting me to say, \"Oh I'm so sorry, you're right!!! I did not order it, but only thought I did.\" Ummm, forgive me if I'm wrong, but even if I forgot to mention it -- which I didn't -- I shouldn't get lectured over what I did and didn't order.    About five minutes later, I'm greeted with frozen mochi. So frozen in fact that it is stuck to one of the bamboo wrapped decorations and almost tastes stale. I actually picked up the bamboo decoration and swung the mochi around for a good minute -- thats how frozen it was. You can't make this up. I actually asked about why it was tasting weird and stale and he just played it off like it was my fault for ordering it -- which I'm starting to think it was.   Maybe I don't understand how customer service works... or maybe I just have the standards of P!nk when she doesn't get her sparkling Voss.  Either way, I think I'll start going to the Hard Rock location from now on.",

    "text": "Peruvian and Japanese fusion is a fascinating one for me.  We came here with a big group of about 12-14 people and were told that the recommended way to dine was to have the waiter take down our preferences and then curate a menu with the chef based on those preferences and what we hoped to spend per person.  We ended up settling on about $120 per person, which got us about 8 dishes and a big platter of sushi.  I am glad that we did it that way, because I got to try a few different things.   Before I go into whether the dishes we tried were good, I must preface this with saying that after browsing Yelp - I really wanted to try one particular dish.  I really wanted to try the black cod with miso because of the way people rave about it in the reviews. Well, here am I to rave it about it some more.  If you come here and just try one dish, the black cod with miso has to be the one. It is the most tender, delicious fish I have ever eaten at a restaurant and has ruined me forever for these types of dishes at any other japanese place.  Also, an overall note about this place is that because of the peruvian influence, the dishes are a lot more citrusy than what you would get at a typical japanese place.   Here are some of the other dishes we got:   - Shishito Peppers: these were to start. Shishito peppers are shishito peppers and these were done well. Nothing particularly special about shishito peppers to me though.  - Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno: Not bad, good quality sashimi, like many of the rest of the dishes, more citrusy than typical japanese food. Some in my party were not fans of the citrus flavor, but I really liked it.  - Snapper with Dry Miso Crumbles, Garlic Chips, Yuzu: I was a big fan of the garlic chips and the fish combination for this one. I would recommend this one over the yellowtail sashimi if you're choosing a sashimi dish because of the unique flavors. - Rock tempura shrimp: This dish was not very special - it's basically fried shrimp. If you're coming to Nobu, I would recommend getting other things.   A few of the other dishes were also sashimi type dishes, all with a citrus flavor.  We also got a few beef dishes (one with truffles and one topped with fried onions), which were both quite good.  Finally, they gave us an assortment of sushi (and we also got the toro nigiri on our own). The sushi was pretty good but not super notable.",

Ok, here was my one gripe with the omakase menu, we were served mackerel for our first dish. It was fishy and tasted the way it smelled. Some may like it, but I wasn't a fan. All the other sushi dishes are delicious. For the hot dishes, I wasn't impressed at all with their black cod or the meat dish. It was just too sweet and tasted caramelized. I kind of wished that they just served sushi for the rest of the dishes.     For what we ate, I think it was over-priced. I've had much better omakase at a better price. If you want to impress a date, take them here. If you want the same tasting sushi at a lower price, go somewhere else. Not sure why they have such high reviews. I guess when you're paying so much money, you convince yourself that the meal was just that good.",

If I could give 1/2 stars, I would have rated the restaurant 3.5 stars.  The stand-out was the miso black cod, which i would give 4.5 stars.

    "text": "One of the, no joke, top ten meals of my life.  This review is brief because I don't really know all of WHAT I ate, but what I can say is this:  * If you have a group, this is an amazing place to come.  They have large, 10 person, knights of the round-esque tables with rotating bezels for the different plates.  You can spin them around and share everything really easy this way.  Table size is perfect, too, because you can easily talk to every person in your group.  * Sake is a great play; easy to share, lot of unique (I think? what the hell do I know) varieties.  * If you have a group, they'll recommend a sort of \"chef menu\" thing where your server just brings a bunch of plates out in phases that accommodate your budget.  Our group said $100-$150 a dude (without drinks) and we had a perfect meal.  Everyone left full, we tried way more dishes than we would have if we were ordering ad-hoc, and there was no headaches splitting up the bill.  Our group dinner was broken up into a few phases: 1) ceviche plates, 2) hot plates, 3) tacos, 4) sushi, 5) dessert (on the house since they had a little wine snafu).  The favorite thing I ate was probably the different ceviches; the salmon one was particularly good.  Really tasted different than a normal sushi or salmon dish, which I think are generally kind of boring.  The beef taco was also really damn good, but I do agree that -- if I was ordering piecemeal -- it's way on the expensive side.  All in all, Nobu, for me, lived up to all the hype.  Usually these mega-restaurants from top tier chefs are solid but not amazing.  In this case, everything I ate was unique, well executed, and delicious.  Table was perfect. Restaurant was cool.  Service was great.  That's all you can really ask for when you are paying for a premium meal.",

I asked our waiter what vegetarian options they had, and he suggested the tofu toban yaki and vegetables for $30. I asked if there were any off menu items, and the chef told him there was a tofu with cantaloupe salad also for $30. I ordered the latter, and there must have been some miscommunication because it ended up being so small, I wouldn't even call it an appetizer. I'm surprised they both cost $30 for such vastly different amounts of food. I promptly called our waiter over, and he willingly switched my entree for the tofu toban yaki and vegetable stir fry. This ended up being cooked in flamed sake, and it had a rich sake flavor, which I think was pretty unique. However, I'm kind of disappointed and feel ripped off that I essentially paid $30 for tofu and vegetable stir fry that didn't even include unique vegetables. Ultimately, it kind of sucked that my girlfriend and I weren't able to eat at the same time.  My girlfriend ordered their black cod, one of their signature dishes, which she loved. This was a large piece of fish cooked well and included their miso sauce.   I personally would not go back nor recommend this place to somebody who doesn't eat seafood. If you eat seafood, you'll probably like the food, but be prepared to pay out the wazoo.",

It started off as a \"minus\" experience because the restaurant misplaced our reservation, despite me walking up to the hostess the previous day and making it in person.  But, they seated us right away in the lounge area, so no harm, no foul.  The ambience was great... the larger-than-expected restaurant had a modern/Japanese vibe.  The service was as to be expected for one of Chef Nobu's restaurants.  Our waitress was knowledgeable and our courses arrived at a perfect pace.  As for the food... it was nothing short of fantastic.  Having not eaten at a Nobu restaurant before, every dish was a treat.  We all opted for the prix fixe menu.  At $125 it was expensive, but Drew only turns 30 once, so what the heck.  There was a good mix of cold and warm dishes, as well as a few non-fish items.  While it was a great overall meal, I doubt I'd pay that much for that meal again.      Pros:  Food.  Service.  And food.  Cons:  Price.",

I had just got married and my husband & I were in the mood for sushi.   As we approached the ambiance was great. It was tucked into the forum shops and in the middle of the hotel. One of the hostess was pretty much a straight up bitch. Sorry honey if you dont like your job or kids, but you can quit. We had our 2 year old with us and had her in her stroller. She was rude in the sense in telling us, not really asking, but telling us to fold up our stroller and leave it at the front. My husband did not want to do that, so we didn't.  Our waitress, I forget her name, she was really cool. Very helpful in explaining the menu and recommended a few items. We settled on a few different pieces of sushi as well as cut and handrolls.  Our dish was brought out on a large platter and boy was I disappointed. The only rolls that were really cut into normal sizes, was my husbands spider roll. The others were just way too small and so not worth the price.   For what we paid, I expected more. I realize this is a trendy spot, but so not worth it for the overpriced sushi and rolls.",

Sorry, I know you have high standards, but this guy could have cared less that we were there. I think the big thing was he tried to up sell us on a Chef platter, and we said no we would like to pick our own meals not the chef. So after that he went cold. The food is very tasty. I would recommend it and will be back. I just hope I have another waiter. I have a shell fish and gluten allergy and they were easy to work with.",

    "text": "Came here and sat at the sushi bar alone, better than not coming at all. :) I ordered the tasting menu. They gave me a choice of $125 or $175. I figured go big or go home so I got the more expensive. All of the cold courses were amazing. Just what you would expect. The standouts were the 1st course octopus and 2nd tuna tartar. After that were sashimi and sushi which included no salmon (they asked what I liked in the beginning and I said salmon) and I was suprised they didn't give me any. Then came the prepared food. Scallop really good. Wagu beef melt in your mouth but very fatty and greasy. Would not get again and the beef was why I paid the $50 more. There was a cold noodle dish as last course before dessert that was boring and forgettable. Dessert was good. I had to order sashimi salmon and pay separately which was $ and unfair in my opinion seeing as I was sitting at sushi bar and voiced that I liked salmon. If I did it again I would get the $125 menu and skip the wagu and be more vocal that I wanted salmon when they brought my sushi/sashimi course. Overall, amazing sushi. That's why you go to Nobu anyway so stick with that and you won't regret it. Spent $280 for myself!!! Very $",

Mid sip the hostess let us know that our table was ready and before I could ask she told me she'd take care of the drink transfer so that we didn't have to close out with the bartender.  This service I love!  We sat down in a cozy table towards the front of the restaurant.  Promptly after being sat our server, Heather, came over and introduced herself and walked us through the menu, both food and drinks.  We decided on a \"custom\" Omakase.  Heather was so passionate and excited about the menu, I had to let her pick for me.  We tried 4 different types of sake based on her recommendation. Heather did an amazing job picking out a variety of dishes and then pairing them with our sake choices.  She's so genuine and grateful to serve you and definitely made my experience memorable.  I'll gladly revisit because of her.",

My friend and I sat down starving asking for a menu. The waitress asked us if we've ever been there before - to which we answered no. (I'm sure this is where she knew she could get us.) She then tells us that they don't do menus here. She continues by saying their menus are 'vague' and 'hard to understand'. It is her job to find the best items for you on the menu and bring those to you. She starts by pushing 2 sashimi  items and then says she will serve us with a hot dish and then something else (I stopped listening and cut her off). I told her very straight and to the point that we were only interested in rolls. Again....she told us she is bringing us the 2 sashimi. Honest to God, she would not take no for an answer!!! Finally, we agreed because it felt like we were arguing with her and it was putting a damper on our night. We then insisted that we do NOT want the hot menu - we only want rolls. Again, she starts pushing it on us. I've never seen any restaurant so pushy!!! After she brought us the 2 sashimi rolls, I started to panic what the price of these were because something felt shady. Again, I insisted on a menu (for the like 5th time). She brought the menu and the menu was NOT hard to understand or vague - she completely lied to us!!!! And....you will love this....those 2 items were $60 plus tax and tip and we didn't even like them!!! I asked to speak to a manager about this and the manager refused to come over and refused to even reduce the price of these over priced dishes that were forced upon us. We ended up ordering some rolls and I've got to be honest, they were horrible! I'm so perplexed how anyone could give this restaurant a good review? The ambience was below average...food was awful and the service was deceptive - not to mention the prices here were insane!!! Honestly, we felt like we had been scammed! It ruined our night. I really think they know most people eating their are tourists and will never be back. Therefore, I believe they try to scam you into paying for expensive dishes and then once you get the bill, the manager refuses to reduce the price. If you look at previous reviews, other people have gone through something similar. BEWARE!!!   The next evening we went to Koi and OMG...I can't believe the difference!!! They had the most amazing sushi, beautiful ambience and the best service! It was my birthday and they brought over a free cocktail and a free desert. Nobu would have charged us for that - probably double the normal cost!!! In addition, Koi's sushi had all those amazing sauces - where Nobu doesn't believe in sauces - which is part of why their rolls suck!",

Nice low lighting with the tables spaced out so you feel very private in a very busy room. The bone in filet was off the charts!  The sushi was on point and super fresh. The service was great as well, it seemed like there were 2 servers at our table the whole time.

I've waited tables for several years before going into my profession.  So I know what good and bad service looks like.  This was definitely the POOREST service I have ever experienced in all of my travels.  My boyfriend and I ate here after seeing Elton John.  We did not feel like a large meal and were ordering sushi plates as we went.  The waiter was very impatient when we weren't ready to order the next round when he returned.  He was also impatient when my boyfriend didn't know which drink to get because they were out of the liquor for the cocktail he had picked on the menu.  Now seeing we were not ordering a ton of sushi cause we did not want a large meal, this seemed to tick off our waiter.  The crowning blow was when were low on our drinks and the waiter asked if we wanted another.  We declined.  He then suggested if we \"wanted to share a drink.\"  Really douchebag?  Really?  I was caught off guard and could not believe that I was hearing this.  If I was more on my game I would have asked to see a manager right then and there.  After that point the dude is lucky I didn't deck him.  The sushi was very good and interesting but the whole bad service experience from this punk ass snot marred the whole dinner.  With so many restaurant choices in Vegas, do yourself a favor and avoid this one.  Go to Craftsteak instead.  ....And to the manager who emailed us to resolve the issue.  A server that is this rude to a table is NOT one of your better servers.  Learn how to manage a service staff.",

    "text": "One word:  Phenomenal  Spectacular dinner. We ordered the custom menu where the waiter and chefs select an omakase based on your requests and preferred price.   For ~$175pp, we had amazing sashimi, wagyu, lobster.  Fresh.  Perfect.  Classic Nobu preparations with excellent balance of citrus, heat, etc.  Everything we expected and more.   \"Best dish of the night\": an off-menu lobster \"pasta\" where the \"pasta\" was hearts of palm, served with a light(ish, given the composition) yuzu / buerre blanc.  Lobster was cooked perfectly, dish was amazing...  A couple of things we would have skipped:  - The Nobu signature shrimp... good, but heavy and not to our preference - Off-menu cherry dessert. Wonderful cherries (although prob too many), elegant sour cream ice cream, odd granola crumble (sesame seeds in the crumble seemed very out of place).   But overall, amazing. We'll be back.",

    "text": "Excellent!  I booked a week at Nobu Hotel inside the Caesar's palace and I had to give this place a try.  I am a sushi/sashimi lover, and the fusion of sushi/sashimi dishes I have seen in magazines, made me put this place in my top 10 sushi trips. I came for dinner, and there was a special menu.  It had samples of different types of sushi/sashimi, and even tapas style Japanese cuisine.  The plate, which included a variety of mini desert bites, was about $120, which was money well spent. This place is trendy, and definitely a spot to hit if you love sushi.    I didn't leave here bloated or wanting to explode.  I was satisfied with every bite1  Most people complain about sushi prices, or claim to love sushi, but order sushi rolls.  Which cover the taste of the actual fish.  The presentation is beautiful and taste is superb.  If you enjoy all-you-can eat sushi for $15.99, this is not a place for you.  You won't find poor quality fish here.  I ordered a 8 piece High Roller bento box for room service.  One of the pieces was lobster.  It was $250, now I see why it was called the High Roller, lol  This is a place I will be returning",

It looked like no love was put forth into the food. We opted to order from the menu rather than omakase because we had a show to attend afterwards. You usually have to allot 3 hours for one of those shindigs & we simply did not have the time. Good thing too because i can not imagine sitting there for 3 hours for mediocre food. Our server was ok. He came off as very pretentious though when he realized we weren't doing omakase. The hostesses were stuck up snobs that didnt acknowledge us when we arrived or left. After dropping $400 on dinner at a snooty place, we grabbed some burgers from whitecastle after our show. It was more satisfying than our whole experience at Nobu.",

    "text": "I knew something had to give cause my Vegas trip was going too good. Won the Super Bowl so I was having wet dreams of Sushi for my dinner at Nobu. Then it happened at dinner !!!  Where do I start ... Yes, Rice and I'll say it again rice. Rice is the basic foundation that gives us Asians identity, culture, life ...Without rice there would be chaos, anarchy in the streets and darkness in the hearts of men. As Jiro stated in Dreams of Sushi, rice is the most important part of Sushi !!! What part of that did you miss Nobu The Fricking Rice was under cook!!! How can they screw up the basic given in sushi 101 and I'll say it again given as in my sushi rice should be cooked. I was so disappointed after the succulent dreamy ($22 for 1 piece ) Toro went in my mouth. My fricking Nobu / dreams of sushi dining experience came to a screeching halt. WTF !!! Every GD sushi on that platter was the same. At that moment a similar disappointing experience lock away so deep in my mind came back to me. It was when I was trying to pick up a hot and I mean hot chick at Avalon under the influence and finding out she a he!!!  Victoria had a secret . The flash back was intense, I felt nauseated just as I felt that night so long ago ... You can't trust anything in this day and age .  So using my level 7 yoga breathing technique learned from my mail man Mr. Chang to hold the rage down as I called waiter calmly to informed him of the sushi situation. AUGHAAAAAH I can not go on writing this review,  I'm still in mourning...I hope Robert D is reading this \" cooked rice buddy \"",

It was our first time here and we figure this would be the best way to experience the different flavors and dishes Nobu offers. Our sever was very nice and professional and he, along with the food runners, were thorough in their explanations of the dishes. They started us with some raw fish dishes, moved towards lightly cooked dishes with more complex flavors, and finished with the wagyu. Overall we were served 11 courses, all great tasting, all beautifully presented. Loved the restaurant, however be prepared to spend quite a bit. I think a decent meal for one would probably be between 200-250. More if you opt for their signature choices. Worth it though.",

My favorites were the:  Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno - light and acidic, with a little kick Nobu Crispy Rice with Big Eye Tuna - I could have literally eaten a bowl of this! The rice was perfectly bite sized and crispy without being burnt and the tuna was seasoned well. Chilean Sea Bass with Dry Miso - moist, tender & not overpowered by the miso Rock Shrimp Creamy Spicy - popped those crunchy, sauce laden babies in my mouth like candy!  Service was on point and we all had a great time! Needless to say, this was definitely a memorable experience for me :-)",

The meat (quality/seasoning/doneness) was not to my satisfaction.  The chocolate dessert/cake at the end was overly sweet and strong thus overpowering the whole meal.  Also, Hot sake options were limited.  Service was fine.  Tab came out to $354 for 2 w/out tip and w/ sake.  Enjoyed the meal overall but not as memorable as I would have liked.  I think New York has spoiled me....",

    "text": "This was my third visit to NOBU at Caesar's Palace in Las Vegas.  It rates on my list of top ten restaurants in the world.  The ambiance is stunning, the service is exceptional, and the cuisine is phenomenal in every sense.  When we arrived, we were greeted by a lovely hostess who escorted us to a fantastic table surrounded by a wicker cocoon where we could observe passers-by in the casino but still felt intimate and private.  Our server, Amber, was quick to visit our table with menus.  When she learned we had dined there before, she suggested we consider having the chef design our dining experience and asked for budget parameters.  A very smart way to create a custom prix-fixe.  We chose to dismiss the menus without even looking and let the chef's selections begin.  Our first course was the Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno.  It happens to be one my favorites.  Bright delicate slices of yellowtail with a light lime infused sauce topped with slashes of jalapeno.  How such a simple dish can be so wonderous is beyond me.  Gorgeous pure unpretentious presentation that burst with flavor.  Next up, Soft Shell Crab Tempura.  A generous portion of perfectly prepared crab.  Crisp, just the right amount of batter, and seasoned to bring out the natural essence and not mask the flavor of this fantastic crustacean.  Maybe the best soft-shell crab I've ever had.  It was about at this point that Aaron Hopwood, the Bar Manager/Sommelier, paid our table a visit to check on us.  What a nice touch.  Aaron was sincerely interested in our dining experience and it gave us a chance to give praise to the immaculate service we were receiving from Amber and the rest of the team.  It's rare to find such exceptional, efficient and warm care.  Following the crab was the Filet Mignon with Crispy Onions.  The filet was nestled under wisps of fried onions that were so delicate they absolutely melted in your mouth.  The filet was medium rare, and thinly sliced in a light sauce.  The combination was sensational.  For our closing course, the chef chose to present a special sushi plate with various filets and rolls.  The highlight for me was it included two delicately fried Sawangani River Crabs.  These tiny fresh water crabs are about the size of a silver dollar and are eaten whole.  They are so crispy, crunchy, and flavorful.  I've only had them once before in my life and absolutely fell in love with these exotic crab delicacies.  What a treat.  At this point, we were completely sated.  The perfect combination of dishes and just the right portions.  An absolutely exceptional evening on all levels.  We can't wait to visit NOBU again.",

Halfway through our meal a cockroach ran under our booth! These things happen but in a fine dining establishment...? A waiter scooped the roach up w a napkin...a cloth napkin people use to wipe their face. Im hoping this went straight in the trash. The kicker was when we told our waiter he said, \"Oh, Its just because of the environment. They come inside because of the heat. We spray ALL the time and they just keep coming.\" By this time even my husband was grossed out. He offered us free dessert like we were at Golden Coral or some cheap buffet. No thanks. If you're looking for great sushi and exceptional service try Naked Fish off the strip. You won't be disappointed.",

The mushroom soup here and the spicy seafood soup are absolutely to die for.  Our server was excellent - attentive, friendly and helpful.  The decor and ambience are delightful.  However, we ordered the seafood specials - Toro sashimi and salmon belly.  They were both pretty good.  The skin on the \"crispy\" salmon skin roll was soggy and the pieces were much too large.  We ordered a bottle of the Nigori unfiltered Sake to complement the meal - a good choice but the $70 price tag underscores what Nobu is about .... $.  Our total bill came to about $300 (which was about what I expected) but I was disappointed yet again by many of the little details.  As an example, Nobu uses cheap bamboo chopsticks very similar to the ones you get at Panda Express.  On this occasion my girlfriend got a nasty splinter in her finger that made it very uncomfortable for her to eat.  The EMTs at Caesar's Palace came to help us remove it but they are not allowed to handle tweezers and/or needles so we had to settle for a bandaid.  During this entire incident the manager came by once and then scurried away.    I've got to say that there are many dining choices at Caesar's Palace, LV that are far better choices than Nobu (unless you just want a bowl of soup).",

Sauces are way over powering on natural qualities of main ingredients and none really had complimentary flavor profiles.  Suggest going a la carte and picking out what you know you like.  Though, I would just put $400 on black and go eat at a food court.  You might lose $400 but you could also be up $400.

If you compare omakase with la's sushi bars you will never like this one.. any how live and learn !!

Of all the options on the strip, this is a good place to eat tasty sushi: compared to SF of Oahu, this is just average.  The pro: the fish is very fresh, the service is attentive, good recommendation for the \"specials\" The cons: expensive, the wait is long, and the drinks are rather small for what you pay.

    "text": "Nobu gets two stars-naw never-mind, one-because it's not disgusting low standard sushi, but not the highest quality fish flown in from Tsukiji Market, Tokyo, Japan.   The sushi rice is lightly seasoned with rice vinegar and sugar; the flavor is almost nonexistent. At any moment there are between 7-10 sushi chefs behind the sushi bar that are all wearing plastic gloves are they make their nigiri & rolls... Some of their fish is pre-cut, and not only for the rolls, but the nigiri as well.   I asked who was the head sushi chef, and the waitress sat me in front of him; I forgot his name which mirrors how unmemorable my sushi eating experience was. He asked me what I wanted; I asked if he had an omakase  nigiri option, and he said no. I asked him if there was a tokujo: highest-ranked Sushi tuna option, and he didn't express that he knew what I was talking about. I asked him if he seasoned the nigiri ala Jiro & other high end Master sushi chefs, and he told me to just use the wasabi and mix it with the, \"soy sauce.\" I couldn't help but laugh out loud. I understand that most places you do season your own nigiri & rolls if you're into rolls with wasabi & shoyu, but Nobu is claiming that it's a high end authentic sushi restaurant and it is not.   The chefs are absolutely not formally trained under a lineage of Master sushi chefs. Their knives look somewhat average quality, as their steel is not strategically assigned to only fish, and only rolls & produce i.e. they were not switching knives for each tasks with their plastic gloves hands-like they absolutely do at authentic sushi bars.   I ordered the aged bluefin, anago, hotate, salmon belly & uni from Japan instead of the premium nigiri option because unlike omakase at my favorite sushi restaurant Sanraku in San Jose, I completely did not trust this plastic glove wearing sushi chef who the hostess said did not with the rest of the sushi making staff have formal training in Japan.   The tuna was sparsely sliced, and wasn't the highest quality. The hotate was definitely not from Japan and lacked sweetness and flavor; I seriously think it is from Costco because I buy scallops from there all the time and it tastes identical. The salmon belly was good; farmed but not bad. The anago was very disappointing, try and way overly seasoned with teriyaki sauce; sad to say it tastes like unagi and not authentic Japanese anago nigiri. At this point I told the guy to forget about the uni from Japan; he just smirked and said, \"next time...\" There won't be a next time...  I purposely didn't write about price as I don't like my reviews to be skewed or influenced by price-as I want them to be merited on taste & deliciousness or lack thereof only. But, I must say-the price is absolutely ridiculous! And, if I factored the price of this ignoramus stupid sushi in the star would be in the negatives. I usually go hard & fat when I tip-if even with a bad experience because you never mess with people who serve you food-food for thought... But, I tipped as scarcely as the cuts of fish that were placed on the tasteless sushi rice was served to me... I'll never go back to Nobu because I don't respect liars & imposters! I have more respect for a Chinese or Korean owned all you can eat sushi spot trying to come up because these folks work hard, and don't get the respect that they deserve. The people at Nobu are trying to prevent that they're something that they are not. They are the Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu version of being fake Black Belts. Totally dishonorable fake imposters with mediocre low quality sushi that will fool ignoramus drunk Las Vegas gamblers. People from Japan would never eat here! And Nobu's wasabi is cheap green pasty shit and their ginger is average if Nobu was a sushi buffet. Last time I was at Sanraku in San Jose, CA the WHOLE sushi bar was filled with Japanese speaking people-except me as I'm Sansei & Hafu. The Japanese lady sitting next to me told me not to tell anyone, and to keep Sanraku a secret. These customers would completely frown on Nobu! I was honestly & sincerely hoping for a grand sushi eating experience being that I was in Las Vegas and do not gamble or drink, but Nobu shot me in the feet as my palate is in recovery that I hope is not permanent i.e. You're better off eating buffet style sushi than Nabu while in Las Vegas; Nobu Sushi is a ginormous ignoramus mistake...",

The visual presentation was very appealing, and the sake was very smooth.  We told the waitress what we liked and she basically picked the food menu for us.  But, we specifically asked for the yellowtail jalapeno.  And, that was a melt in your mouth experience.  You must add a bit of the cilantro to each bite to get the complex flavors and texture.    We had butter fish and surf and turf (beware, super expensive) and when they lit the beef on fire over the stones at the table, it was nothing short of FUN!  The meat texture was so tender.  Both the steak and lobster were served with a distinct, flavorful sauce, and the pickles on the plate were soooo yummy.  Who knew pickles blended well with lobster?    When the final entree of sushi arrived, I doubled down and tried them all.  Assorted, super fresh fish.  By then, I was in a food coma, but it was blissful.",

There was so much to choose from, we ended up trying the Omakase multi-course dinner with flights of sake and whiskey as we thought this would be the best way to experience the chef's signature dishes.   Our meal started with cold appetizers which included chef's sushi and sashimi assortments. The Whitefish with Yuzu sauce just melts in your mouth while the crunchy sea grapes offers a different textural experience. The salmon carpaccio Salad with Lettuce Handroll was refreshing and crispy. The Chef's Sushi Assortment and Chef's Sashimi Assortment were decadently amazing. Yellowtail Sashimi with Jalapeno, toro, Salmon Tartare with Caviar, Blue Fin Toro Tartare with Royal Ossetra Caviar. Yum! The pickled peach that accompanied the appetizers was delicious.  Our hot entrees included their signature Black Cod Miso, which was succulent and both sweet and savory. The Beef Toban Yaki was tender and nicely paired with mushrooms and caramelized onions. I liked this much better than the NY bone-in steak we had for dinner the prior night at Bouchon. While the tofu was delicious, the miso soup was a little salty for me. I actually couldn't finish it after a couple sips.   We finished dinner with the bento box dessert which included a sinfully rich flourless Chocolate Cake, White Chocolate Sauce, Shiso Syrup & Green Tea Ice Cream.    The service was wonderful and ambiance lively.  Looking forward to another visit!",

Maybe she had a bad day. And it just went on like that for the whole night, never checking in (she was just not around and reachable if we needed anything). And to put the cherry on the top, I understand it's more of a courtesy than a rule, but it sucks to see that the table next to us got something for their celebration and and we just got a yellow smile and a \"again, congratulations.\"   Can't say I should come back here if that's the type of treatment we will receive.",

    "text": "We ended up at Nobu because of circumstance more than anything else. I've long heard the hype but this was my first time actually eating here. Upon first impressions the ambiance was good - trendy and the kind of thing you'd expect from a Japanese fusion eatery. The waitstaff were all very attentive and helpful at navigating the menu and recommending the best dishes.   Overall the food was good, not great. We sampled a mix of cold and hot appetizers and entrees as well as the sushi. The quality of ingredients was good, as was the presentation, however the flavor of the dishes didn't match.   Highlights: Try the crispy rice and tuna tartar appetizer. It was something different and put a nice spin on a standard tartar. The sushi was good quality and what you'd expect from the place like Nobu. The toro was excellent, as were the uni, amaebi and unagi. The unagi sauce was quite good and made in house which is a departure from the shimmering gloop most sushi joints in the states serve.  Low lights: The yakitori dishes were a disappointment overall. We sampled the beef, shrimp, sea bass and pork belly. They come with your choice of teriyaki sauce or a South American style chimichurri - neither were very good. The teriyaki sauce was overbearing and much too sweet. The South American option had a nice kick but seemed out of place with Japanese ingredients. The pork belly was too gelatinous, as if it had been cooked and left to cool for many hours - skip it.   Overall Nobu is a lot of hype and shines too brightly amongst other, far better sushi options off The Strip. Come for the ambiance and the trend factor. But if you're looking for the best quality sashimi and nigiri, look elsewhere.",

We let them know when we made the reservation it was the highlight meal of our honeymoon, so I think we got a very experienced waiter as a result. He walked us through everything and was beyond helpful. He had been with Nobu for over 8 years. We decided to order a few things off the menu. We started with the yellowtail jalepeno cold dish appetizer. Flavors were amazing. The salmon skin salad was also divine. My husband was nuts for the beef tenderloin toban-yaki. The only thing we ordered that I wasn't crazy about was the sea bass jalapeno tempura. I found it to be a little bland. But the amazingness of everything else overshadowed that. I'm not sure if I'll ever get to go back, but it definitely lived up to my expectations!",

    "text": "I am writing this review based on the restaurant side only and not the teppenyaki side.    I went to this new Nobu on 2/13 and it was packed from walk-ins and pre-Valentine dates.  I called ahead to make reservations for 8 p.m. as that was the earliest you could make a reservation on that particular day due to a function.  The hostess on the phone was not very friendly and very rude, and I knew who she was as soon as I arrived.  The hostess desk was very unorganized and they had no clue as to what they were doing.  But this is the strip, people do not care what you think because they know they will get business no matter what and most people are from out of town and will not ever be back anyways.  The manager, who I quickly recognized from the Nobu in the Hard Rock needs to help them instead of stand around like I saw her do the whole night.  Anyways, that was really my only gripe about this place,  and I do not see this particular location getting another Michelin star anytime soon.  They cannot say the new servers and staff do not know what they are doing because they all came from the old Nobu.  Get it together. (Front desk, management).    As for the best part.  The sushi is still amazing here as well as all of their hot dishes.  Like most people that do not know anything about sushi, you will most likely get the Yellowtail Jalepeno sashimi dish because you heard it was good.....IT IS AMAZING, only 6 pieces but worth the $$$.  I have been to Nobu many times at different locations and I would highly a few of these dishes:  Yellowtail Jalepeno Sashimi Tuna Tataki Any of the New Style Tiradito dishes 100% get the Rock Shrimp Tempura with Creamy Sauce, you won't regret it. If your down for spending to impress get the O Toro Black Cod Miso Beware, shrimp tempura is only two pieces 8$ Get the Hamachi Kama for sure Most of these dishes are small, so if they don't fill you up get the beef of tenderloin But remember this is a Japanese restaurant not a steak house. And to top it off get the Bento Box for dessert!  If you haven't spent at least 100-120 per person you did not do Nobu right.  This place is no Jiro sushi and definitely better than Yellowtail in the Bellagio, which is a cheap ripoff of Nobu, but definitely the best Japanese restaurant you will find in the United States hands down.  Giving three stars for service.",

    "text": "you must be tripping if you think this restaurant deserves 4+ stars. how the hell can you justify $20+ for seared hamachi with jalapeno? It's the same damn dish served by 50%+ of the other japanese restaurants out there, except it's $10 more expensive!  The quality of the food isn't bad, but it sure isn't on par with a Sasabune or Sushi-Zo. And there's nothing innovative about the menu at all that you cant get from most other japanese restaurants, so quality is really a big weighing factor here!  I get that there's a certain premium that you're expected to pay to dine at a prime location in Caesars, but they are literally bending you over the table, pulling down your pants, and....well, you get the idea.  The service was pretty good, so if you are looking to have dinner in a nice, upscale restaurant, and don't mind paying exorbitantly for decent food, then by all means this would be a respectable choice. But just know that you can very easily take a cab 10 min off the strip to any number of japanese restaurants that serve same or higher quality dishes at 1/3  ~ 1/2 of the cost.  I was browsing through a yelp review while i was there to see what to order, and i actually saw a reviewer sitting at the table next to us who gave the restaurant 5 stars. She was eating some maki rolls by nudging a roll with her chopsticks...onto a spoon, and then eating out of the spoon. Her bf is a lucky, lucky man....",

This is a sleek, chic ambient place that begs to stay and try new things.  As most reviews have mentioned over and over, the black miso cod and lobster roll can't be missed. The flavors are just so so good. I will add that we tried the sea bass skewers, and filet and both were excellent as well.  If your feeling adventurous this is the place to do it as far as sushi goes. It is fresh and delicious and the variety we tried this time around left us full yet we managed to finish it all. 6 different rolls and all were exceptional.  For those who are undecided and want to try a little of everything there is several tasting menus to choose from, but if that's too much, tell your server your preferences and they will direct you to the perfect sashimi nigiri or sushi. Chefs specials we ordered were also impressive!  So go ahead and splurge and be adventurous here, try things you haven't tried and you'll be pleasantly surprised.  If you have room left for dessert, get the banana one. The drinks were also fresh and inventive!",

    "text": "Nobu is my favorite Japanese place! I am extremely sad that there isn't a Nobu in San Francisco. I heard about Nobu from my sister who is a huge foodie and she told me this is the place to go if you are in Vegas. I was a bit hesitant because I typically don't like sushi or sashimi, which is something nobu is known for. I decided to go anyway because my boyfriend loves Japanese food.  When I were there, I was in awe. First off, the restaurant is beautiful. The interior design is mesmerizing and has a unique feel to it. I made the mistake of not making a reservation, but there were able to seat me next to the sushi bar right away.   Our waiter was awesome! He was super knowledgeable and had a great sense of humor. Being in front of the sushi chefs was also a great experience because everything they were making looked delicious.    We ordered the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno that was with yuzu and cilantro. OMG, it was amazing! It was like nothing I ever had before. It was so full of flavor. Unlike other normal sushi restaurants, I wanted to get more and more sashimi. Anyone who doesn't like raw fish should go here and try it. You just might change your mind!  Another memorable dish we got was the seared trout with flash fried spinach which was also spectacular. I have never tasted flash fried spinach and it was definitely different, but delicious. I would also recommend the eggplant hot dish. Equally as amazing.   Now we left with a bill of $200, but we were full. So if you are willing to pay a little extra and get the best Japanese food in the US, go here!",

However, there was enough here that I can't get elsewhere and things that I can get were better.  Loved the salmon belly sashimi, and the A5 steak was so amazing. It's served on black rocks surrounded by coarse white salt, then set on fire!  If you're ready to drop $500 per couple it is definitely an experience.  Take advantage of server recommendations.",

Arnold, our server, was not only attentive and kind, but his finite knowledge of the foods and sake (the region where it is made, the milling of the rice used, etc) was unparalleled and it elevated the experience of Nobu even that much more. He is simply stellar.   We had three each of cold and hot plates, two bottles of sake, the famed black cod miso, and the Kobe beef (flambeed at table).   And, since it was my birthday, a very special dessert with a gracious wish from Nobu.    Sincerely and without question, this was the ABSOLUTE BEST meal experience I have EVER had.",

The drink was good, the yellow tail roll was average (anything you would expect from your local strip mall sushi bar,) the tartare dish ($51) a little bit larger then the size of a silver dollar with something on top that resembled caviar but was nowhere close - the real ossetra caviar is famous for very distinct and succulent kernels.  What I got was something squeezed out of a paste tube on top of raw tuna - yes, yummy!  The bill came to over $100 including tip and I left very hungry and feeling completely ripped off.  Even by Vegas standards this was highway robbery.  Shame on you, Nobu!",

I ordered the wagyu and lobster tacos, an eel & cucumber hand roll, and black cod miso.

I thoroughly enjoyed my black cod--the portion was HUGE, and the taste was excellent. Our table shared several sushi and sashimi pieces, which were fresh and tasty. The miso soup and their spinach salad are also great!  The food comes out fairly quick, the servers know the menu front and back, and of course the location can't be beat.

    "text": "In a way, it's a disappointment that I'm not giving five stars.  Nobu is a name with weight. It stands for a world-renowned chef and a decorated series of restaurants, many of which have earned Michelin stars. This one in particular has none, although that may be due to unfortunate circumstances, namely the lack of Michelin stars for years now in Las Vegas. Regardless, you can't help but want to try this Peruvian-Japanese cuisine for yourself, and you should.  We went to Nobu in Caesar's Palace to celebrate a friend's birthday. We waited an hour to get seated, we waited a bit too long to receive a menu, and we spent more time while trying to figure out what we wanted to get from the expensive menu. Let's be honest - this isn't a place that you try every day, but price is still a factor.  Our server was helpful in explaining the menu, highlighting menu favorites, and mentioning seasonal items and specials. I would have preferred more writing, but I understand that availability of fish can change often. Anyway, he said he could help work out a menu for us with the chef if we told him what sorts of fish and such that we wanted to eat, and he espoused the virtues of the omakase menus, but after a while we decided just to order and share specific menu items. Others may find that service useful.  Cold items and sushi were presented first, then hot items. And yes, I include prices in my reviews, so deal with it:  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno ($29): this is a really good dish that's not executed wisely. We were instructed to eat a small bit of cilantro with each of the six slices of hamachi, in addition to the jalapeno. See, the thing about piling all the cilantro in the middle is that one person grabbed a little too much cilantro for one piece of fish, which ended up depriving other pieces. This means that because they didn't give extra pieces of a very cheap herb, they prevented the dish from being consistent.  Uni nigiri ($10/pc): some of the best Santa Barbara uni that I've had. Has the essence of the sea, but not in an overpowering way. Sweet. If you haven't had good uni, you haven't lived, so you might as well try it here if you're already gonna be here.  New Style Sashimi - scallop ($35): yeah, I don't quite understand this. The soy sauce, oils, chives, sesame seeds, and ginger were interesting components, but I wouldn't miss those flavors. Plus, the scallop felt like it was sliced too thinly. Maybe I should have gone with the beef?  Soft shell crab cut roll ($20): our server did warn us about this, or rather the entire sushi menu. He said that it wouldn't be anything special compared to other places, and that he always recommends that his guests order off the cold and hot menus. He was right in this case. It was good, but it wasn't worth it when you can get something similar at AYCE sushi places.  Black cod miso ($36): regarded as Chef Nobu's signature dish, this is certainly the best rendition of the dish that I've enjoyed. Incredibly tender cod with sweet flavor, some of which is provided by the sauce that I still can't pinpoint flavor-wise. Regardless, this is definitely my favorite of the night and a must-order.  Squid \"pasta\" with light garlic ($27): squid cut to resemble pasta. I was disappointed initially with the relatively small portion of tender and tasty squid, but thinking back, I'm sure the price would have to be significantly higher to have the right squid ratio. However, the dish grew on me as I kept at it. The vegetables were all executed perfectly, from zucchini to snap peas to the shiitake mushrooms. Strangely, the veggies remind me of kebabs that I've had. In a great way. I'd say that even though my expectations weren't met, I was pleased overall.  Rock shrimp tempura, spicy creamy style ($26): I don't know about this one. It was good, but it wasn't as impressive as I'd hoped. The spicy creamy variant was described as the most popular preparation style by far (as opposed to butter ponzu or jalapeno), but I would have hoped for shrimp that was a little more firm. Maybe you can't do that with this shrimp, but this veers a little too closely to feeling mushy to me. That, and the flavor just isn't extravagant or complex and reminds you of versions of shrimp that are much cheaper.  Flourless bento box ($15): it was a very good chocolate lava cake (with white chocolate and shiso syrup). As expected, I did enjoy the blueberry and the piece of starfruit that I was able to taste, but I would've liked more blackberries and a more prominent role for the matcha ice cream. The ice cream definitely took a back seat to the powerful dark chocolate.  I enjoyed everything, so of course I'm going to go with at least four stars - but no higher, I am certain that you can get better food at a better value elsewhere. For example, there are comparable, even superior cold dishes at Yonaka Modern Japanese just a few miles away. Make Nobu a one-time visit or a special occasion meal, and get the black cod miso.",

    "text": "This is our first time visiting a Nobu Restaurant.    I did my research and read a lot of reviews prior to arriving, and really contemplated between order a la carte or going with their omakase.   The restaurant is pretty big, I wish we were put in a booth, but instead we were put at a round table that seats 4 in the middle.  We decided to order the 175.00 omakase and was told the difference between 125.00 and 175.00 is that 125.00 us based on items on the menu already.  The 175.00 one are items created by the chef that are not on the menu.    First course was king mackerel with sweet potato chip, fried shiso leaf, ginger ponzu sauce.   Next was sashimi salad with barracuda, Bonito tuna, amberjack (this one was soooo good), wrapped Japanese Daikon and greens with Nobu vinaigrette. Everything was so fresh, and the sauce was perfect. The little fried crab was super cute.  It tasted like crab chips but had the texture like chewing on eggshells.   Next Nigiri, blue fin tuna, butterfish, trout, uni and egg. All were superb in their own sauce.  Didn't need soya sauce.   Next sashimi, 2 piece of blue fin Toro belly (melted in your mouth) with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings.  Tako live octopus with rare Japanese mushroom with sesame oil.   Next was a course that needed our presentation.  It was a Himalayan salt block with fresh yuzu and 3 pieces of sashimi.  Was supposed to squeeze the yuzu onto the salt block and run the sashimi over the block a couple of times before eating.. I found it to be too salty, I didn't enjoy this course too much, it tasted better with just yuzu.   Next was Chilean sea bass with Bonito flakes and pressed rapini.  At this time I was getting pretty full already.  The fish was cooked perfectly and had a nice taste. It was in a ponzu sauce again, but went well with the fish.   Next was seared A5 wagyu beef with fried gnocchi.  The beef honestly melted in your mouth like the fatty Toro belly.  There were 5 pieces cooked medium rare and was really good.    Then it was an avocado chilled miss soup with king crab and tobiko.  This was very interesting, came in a small cappuccino cup as presentation, the tobiko added a nice texture and crunch to the soup, and when biting down on the tobiko, there was a sour explosion.  It was very nice.   Lastly dessert was Chai ice cream, blood orange Panna Cota, soya form, marinated Japanese pumpkin and shortbread. The ice cream was so good along with the short bread and soya foam.  The Japanese pumpkin was really sour and didn't really go with the dish.   Overall it was a great experience.  Got to try many different dishes, the service was great!",

Second too overpriced for such bad sushi (rolled in very fast way \"\") and not tasty miso soup. Probably server forgot my order so that's why it took more than one hour to get my simple salmon roll. Definitely I won't be back again. I could have a great buffet for the same price and not be so hungry afterwards.",

Our waiter treated us like we were nothing and we waited 20-30 minutes between our tiny plates. Do not come here if you are looking for good food and good service. We looked at several other restaurants and we chose Nobu even though the ratings weren't as good as the other places we were looking because I really wanted to go...lesson learned. Don't come here.",

He kept us at our budget, and the support staff made sure to keep our plates refreshed for every course which was 9 courses! I took my girlfriend out for her bday, and it is a but pricey, 507 with taxes for the 9 course meal, my girlfriend loved it, the best part was that the food wasnt extremely heavy. It was the right amount to leave room for the next dish, overall this was a night to remember, I will def be back here for another special event.

    "text": "Nobu was just ok. A little too much hype for the experience and the cost.   We dined with two other couples. Two of the three couples were dining for the first time.   They advised how to dine \"3-4 cold dishes, 3-5 hot dishes then move onto the grill\" I get we are in Vegas but I don't feel like dropping $400 for dinner for me and my boyfriend. I told the server and he seemed disappointed but I stood my ground as I had been instructed to do. We made our own tasting menu.   We ordered the following: Two Waygu Beef Tacos- Literally the length of my thumb and $15 each. The meat itself was not warm so I can't say how tasty it was. Tasted like cold, seasoned beef. Nothing melted in my mouth of anything. Two bites and you are done. Chicken Teryaki- this was good but it's about as basic as you can get. Chicken has the skin on. Sauce was not sweet and thin. Not like something you would get at a Chinese restaurant. It was ok but for $35 - it could have been a bit more. It didn't even come with rice. Rock Shrimp with Butter Ponzu sauce- very enjoyable. It was a citrus dish (which I wasn't expecting) I would order this again. Spicy Tuna Roll- good. Wasn't very spicy. My boyfriend had some pieces. He only eat expensive sushi. He enjoyed it. Vanilla Miso Tart- this was the one dish that was amazing. I would eat this again in a heartbeat.   It was a lot to handle. Numerous people were serving dishes, coming from all angles.   The server brought out one bill \"they do not split checks\". The only couple said that you write down the last four of your credit card number next to what you want charged to your card. We all did this and the server was like \"I have a lot of math to do\" and \"this will take my awhile\" Split checks like a regular restaurant and you wouldn't have to worry about doing a lot of math. Also, stop being so dramatic...I'm sure the POS system will do it for you.   So in the end, we paid $214 (including tip) for our share of the bill. Would I return? Probably not. It was nice as a special occasion but the server did not really make it special and actually seemed annoyed he had to assist a bunch of dinners that weren't going to break the bank.",

So, I've easily eaten at 50 different restaurants over the years. And probably closer to 100. Almost every single one of them is gone, even the last one I dined at: the Grand Wok at MGM Grand just four months ago!!  Nobu is an incredible experience for a bon vivant of Japanese cuisine. This is not an AYCE buffet restaurant; don't expect to stuff yourself like a pig at a trough. You'll broach into the world of fine dining here, which is why there's 27 different forks at each place setting. Um, chopsticks, in this case. Understand this, you'll be paying a lot of money, for tiny portions. This is about epicurean presentation and culinary aesthetics, not about seeing how many sashimi slices you can fit in your maw. The delicacies you shall consume were designed and created by a master chef who sat meditating on a mountaintop until a culinary epiphany hit him like a bolt of lightning. Luckily, he survived and came down the mountainside to bring his dream unto the world.   I loved my dining experience here. It was during a solo trip I made to Vegas. Don't think I'd want to bring my young daughter here. She can be a handful at times, and it was nice to be able to just relax, and enjoy myself. And have some great food. I can't wait to come back here. Maybe after I win the lottery! Dining here will set you back a bit, so don't come whining to Yelp about how expensive it is, especially after you just blew your kid's college savings on the Walking Dead slot machines!",

Premium Imported Japanese Wagyu A5 $38 per ounce & make sure to get it on the stones set on fire w/ Courvoisier (we typically have a party of 6-8 ppl so we order 12-16 ounces) but this is so worth it if you don't live in or near Japan 2. Black Cod Miso Lettuce Cups (the cod w/o lettuce cups is good too) 3. Yellowtail Sashimi w/ jalapeno  4. Salmon Sashimi 5. Hamachi Kama - baked 6. Variety of Oysters (allow them to surprise you w/ the diff. toppings they offer. Very fun!)  7. Wagyu sashimi  If you don't order these dishes, (at the very least the top 3-4 listed) you're doing Nobu all wrong. And now that I've had the opportunity to dine at the famous Jiro's Sushi (3 Michelin stars) in Japan, I can still say that I love Nobu Las Vegas. I keep stating LV location because I've tried 3 other Nobu locations that don't always hit the nail on the head in terms of presentation, taste, consistency in food & customer service.  I only have great things to say about the customer service at this location and the manager, Keenan, is the best. He's genuine, honest, & very personable. Each time I'm in town & dine here, he makes it a point to come say hello & make sure everything is perfect with my family & friend's dining experience.",

The flavor was very disappointing it tasted water down not much  I thought the presentation of the food by the servers was good. They did a nice job of explaining each dish. But we felt a bit rushed. Also there was a large table next to us that kept growing. I don't think it is a good idea for a table for 10 people to grow to 17. It ruins the experience for the other guests.  Dessert was very good.  Chocolate cake with molten center,green tea ice cream with a sesame seed wafer.",

The thought that goes into each dish is only surpassed by how delicious they've made every dish.  Expensive is right around what to expect unless your Steve Bezos but absolutely worth the try and I hate to say it because I enjoyed the meal 250 over.  But the bill did come to 450.  Yeah.  But prepare your soul to see that and you will be fine and please enjoy the experience.",

    "text": "A cockroach fell on me at Nobu.  A cockroach fell on my head and on to the table with our food.  A cockroach. A cockroach...skittering across the dessert table...at Nobu. Let that sink in for a minute.  Having had Nobu on my own bucket list, you can imagine how excited I was we booked this during a recent work trip to Las Vegas, especially since the company was picking up the check. We arrived on a Tuesday evening, so the restaurant wasn't over packed, but busy enough for a lively atmosphere. We opted for the tasting menu, and as a pescatarian, I was thrilled when I was promised a fully seafood tasting menu. Course after course was divine, the seafood fresh, and served in delectable forms (jalapeno yellowtail, smoked black cod, and the main entree - a slew of sizzling assorted seafood) were definite standouts...the most outstanding course however was dessert, which came with a mochi ice cream and oh that's right a COCKROACH. An actual roach about 2 inches big fell on my head, then on my arm, and when I shook it off, it fell on the table running around all the dessert plates. One of the servers did catch it, and then they cleared and brought out fresh dessert, but the second round had decidedly fewer items, so who knows if they even made fresh dessert or just brought the same roach-contaminated platters out.  The icing on the cake was when the server came out and said \"the manager sends his apologies and is willing to comp the dessert and offer complimentary coffee\"...I mean...really...for a party of 11 people with full tasting menu orders plus a bottles of wine, that bill was no less than $3000 (with a side of roach) and the manager didn't even come out and talk to us, simply offered a $4 cappuccino from wherever he was hiding.  Rather than make a scene we were civil enough to simply pay the bill and leave. However, looking back at how poorly they handled the situation (the situation being a LITERAL COCKROACH), I wish I had been louder with how I truly felt. I get that Vegas in general can be gross, but when you attend a $$$$ restaurant, I think it should be fair to expect a meal sans roaches. It's unfortunate because the food and service was really quite wonderful, but NONE of that even matters because Nobu will forever be associated with a cockroach. If that's what the dining hall is like, one can only imagine what the kitchen is infested with. @Management, get your s**t together.",

This is another great restaurant that stands out amongst many great places to eat, especially in Las Vegas. Book in advance as it can get very busy. Most of the dishes are tapas style so be prepared to order a couple extra dishes than normal. Great for all types of occasions as we came for a bachelor party. Would highly recommend!",

We also ordered some sort of lobster tempura that was out of this world. Their specialty cocktail list was nice too. I got a lychee flavored one that was delish!  Also, on a previous work dinner there, I was pregnant and I was able to really enjoy so many delicious items that were fully cooked. So if for any reason you're considering this place but cant eat raw fish, you can still have a really enjoyable evening without feeling left out!",

We came prepared with a list of items we wanted to try and while everything tasted great, the biggest issue we had was our hot dishes were either not hot (Waygu gyoza, rice, black cod miso) or they were over cooked (Toban yaki beef tenderloin that we ordered medium rare). I couldn't even take photos of the beef tenderloin because we saw it was over cooked and we were in a hurry to transfer it from the stone pot to our plates. All in all, if only these items were at the appropriate temperature, we would've been over the moon because the food itself is quite good. I think our bill at the end was around $357 so it was pricey and but we knew that coming into it. Tyler, our server, was really nice and he and the food runners did a wonderful job. Our water glasses never got more than halfway full and someone was already ready to clear our dirty plates and replace our silverware. We might come back someday because we're locals but when we left my husband and I both agreed we preferred our dinner at Morimoto much more.",

I've always heard people rave about this place, even Drake, but I finally get it now. 1000% legit!  Yes, you're paying for a lavish experience. It will be ridiculously expensive, but like I said, the steak is life-altering. Our bill for 2 was around $1000 with tip. That was for approximately 11 drinks (I know, excessive. lol), the jalapeno yellowtail, chicken skewers, hella rice, a couple sushi rolls, a wonderful tenderloin, 6oz. of A5 Wagyu, and the half coconut haupia. No leftovers to take home.  To be completely honest, I was a little underwhelmed by the restaurant itself. Yes, it's a pretty space, but I'm sure there could be a little extra flair to look at while you dine for the price. A baby shark aquarium; something. lol We ended up being nestled between 2 couples in a very tight European style row of tables. A little more privacy woulda been great.  Aside from that, service was good, and I'll be back when I can celebrate being rich enough to dine here regularly.",

While other Nobu restaurants are perfectly content at letting their patrons dictate the menu, this one has always heavily suggested letting the restaurant set the pace and dishes. This is not a bad thing, as they do a remarkable job. I went with two others and two of us have dietary restrictions. My friend is lactose intolerant and I'm allergic to egg whites. Our waiter may careful note and ensured that everything we received was utterly fantastic.   We had a couple of the classics - the black miso cod and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno which are absolutely devine. There's no better fish dish than the black miso cod. We had the A5 Wagyu on the rocks with a half a lobster. We dined on this delicious cold salmon dish that I have no idea what it was but it had the most fantastic ponzu sauce. They gave us an assortment of nigiri and rolls that were just fabulous.   The service at Nobu is top notch. They are attentive and responsive. No empty plate stays around long. You never have to wait long for the next dish. Everything is just perfectly timed.   Yes, it is expensive but it is also absolutely delicious.",

Not so long that anyone ever asked \"where's the food\"?  Water was consistently topped off. The only hiccup was they forgot to bring out one soda some ordered for some time.    Food tasted great. We had salmon with caviar on top, grilled chicken and an assortment of sushi and sashimi. All of it tasted very good. I would definitely recommend the salmon to people.    Staffs was very friendly. Maybe could've checked up on us a little more often, but was always professional. I will definitely be coming back for more",

    "text": "I came to Nobu with incredibly high expectations based on all the incredible reviews and my friends recently came back from Japan so they also had high expectations. I didn't anticipate Nobu to be a fusion restaurant and was caught off guard when there were a lot of unusual ingredients paired with Japanese food. As sushi lovers, we were considering the special omakase for $150pp but we found out that out of the 9(?) courses, there would only be 3 pieces of nigiri so we opted to order various dishes from the menu. We found that most of the sauce for the dishes we ordered were either too sweet or too salty. The black cod and wagyu gyoza were all very tasty individually, but the addition of the sauce made both too sweet. The yellowtail sashimi was very fresh (no fishy taste) but there was a little bit too much of the ponzu sauce that made it very salty. Our favorite of the night was the wagyu (we ordered a total of 4oz) and it was flambed over hot stones. Again, the sauce was a bit too sweet but the wagyu by itself was full of flavor and super juicy.  Overall, I found that Nobu was very expensive for the portions we had. We ordered 5 hot dishes, 2 sashimi, and 1 hand roll. It ended up being ~$150pp and we were still not quite full.",

But they happily sested us and told us it happens all the time. The staff was amazing. Polite attentive and patient.  The food instantly appeared after we ordered... I mean we ordered, waitress took our menu... LESS THEN A MINUTE our first plate arrive.... wow! Food is great drinks were delicious...  but portions are ridiculously small..like smaller then my thumb...  and didn't even equal a snack. I am giving it 4 stars due to portion size is so small and the bill was close to $200 for 3 items and 2 drinks. I get fancy, but as you can see in my picture of the 2 micro tacos smaller then my thumb ($25 bucks btw) that if you're looking for a meal,  go elsewhere.

Nobu definitely is $$$$$$$$ and the unfortunate part is that it was NOT a good meal. If I were given a blind taste test, this meal would fall lower than my  neighborhood sushi bar. Did I hear someone mention ambience? This was definitely didn't live up to it. It was as loud as the Cheesecake Factory and with the scores of waiting staff aimlessly running around. The hostess was snooty and told us we almost missed our table when we called to say our flight was delayed. We get in at 8 and find the restaurant empty- it never really filled up during the course of our meal.  Onto the food.  If you want to pay $35 for a tiny scoop of shredded salmon drenched in soy- get the salmon tartar. If you want to pay $20 for 4 oily lotus chips with a tiny piece of tuna on each- get the \"spicy\" miso chips If you want to have the most subpar stir fry (I have eaten better ones in my college dorm)and pay $35 while at it, get the completely under seasoned scallops in garlic sauce If you want to eat more rice than the filling- get any of their sushi roll and pay pretty penny while at it  I could go on.. but you get the picture.  My gripe with Nobu is that it's not as posh as it thinks it is to demand such prices. The food is what I would expect from a sushi takeout place.  Save your time, palette and $$ and go experience something better while you are in Vegas.",

So when we sat down the waiter greeted us promptly. He wasn't as frequently as I like, but I'm from the south and we do things different 'round here!  Lol. But the fella I was dining with was from Arizona. And he felt the exact same way. But maybe the waiter wasn't the ultra friendly type. So I get it. He seemed to be knowledgeable of the menu. He talked so fast though. So we didn't fully understand. But again it didn't ruin dinner.   Now just letting you guys know. This place is pretty pricey for the amount of food. I didn't complain too much, because I wasn't paying. But for you payers. Take note of that.   The portions are very small but flavorful. They do have this full dinner recommendation where the chef selects everything for you. I would have gotten that if It wasn't so late.   No matter what you order make sure the cod is on the lineup.   This place isn't kid friendly though.  But a great place for adults.   Check it out!",

    "text": "I really had high hopes for this restaurant thinking it will be of equal quality like the nobu out in Malibu, California. Sadly, it was not. It didn't even come close.   First of all let's talk about the service. I made reservations for January 20th before seeing Celine Dion. It was in celebration of a long weekend and an early birthday dinner for my upcoming birthday on the 25th. It was stated on my reservation on open table that the occasion was for a birthday. The hostess kindly acknowledged my birthday and wished me a happy birthday and walked us to our table. The waiter seemed friendly but he talked way too fast to even understand what he was saying. It was clear that it was memorized and scripted. He rushed through the menu and left us to look over the menu. I did appreciate that he checked in with us frequently but what drove me nuts was that he wished me a happy birthday 3 times before handing me the bill. I know I should not come to any restaurant with an expectation of a birthday acknowledgement; however, when you pay $255 for dinner, you'd expect more than a verbal \"happy birthday.\" I did not get a cheesy song, cake, or ice cream. I got a fat bill for $255!  Now onto the meal. I ordered the sushi dinner and a tuna hand roll. My friend ordered the premium sashimi dinner. For both of us, the fish was not good. It was chewy and did not taste fresh at all. Sadly, the rice was dry and hard. My friend had to request a second bowl of rice because the first one was too dry. The second bowl of rice was wet and undercooked!!! Finally, the waiter brought out a third rice bowl and it was the rice they use for the sushi (which had vinegar apparently). So the third bowl of rice was a bit more edible but still not fully cooked. Seriously, how hard is it to make rice?!   We came out of the restaurant unimpressed and even a little upset. To pay $255 we had expected better. To be honest, the quality of sushi/fish that we got at nobu can compare to your supermarket quality. It was awful!   I would not recommend eating here. There are so many other restaurants you can eat at in Vegas for half the price. Take your money elsewhere and get a slice of pizza. You're better off even gambling it away than eating at this nobu. Lesson learned. Don't be fooled by the name, it doesn't carry the same high standards as the original nobu.",

My 2 must haves, the yellowtail sushimi with jalapeno and black cod miso, were included as well as many other dishes that wowed us with each presentation.  It would take a small book to describe each wonderful dish we had. I highly recommend it, especially if you haven't eaten here before.   My expectations were met. We started with the yellow tail sashimi with jalapeno. The thin slices with the jalapeno and a piece of cilantro in a tart sauce was outstanding! Then the wagyu taco and tuna taco. They were bit size but loaded with flavor. The wagyu beef melted in my mouth and the sauce brought out deep flavors. The tuna was light and very good. The black miso cod was soft and tender and the fish peeled off like a flower. The sauce was gingery and not overly sweet! We finished with thin slices of snapper with dry miso which gave it a crunchiness.  We ate most of their hit dishes and all met or exceeded our expectations!",

It was my first taste of interesting flavor in Las Vegas. I started with the lobster ceviche. I was expecting a bowl of lobster served with nacho chips. Reckon I'm basic. But no. Nobu's ceviche was served on lettuce. Heavily citrus flavored, but not overwhelming. My friend had shrimp and lobster with mushrooms. The mushrooms were so tasty, there she was devouring them in favor of the lobster and shrimp. There's hope for veganism after all. What the Health?!?!? My steamed sea bass was interesting as well. The dry miso chips on top stole the show. I was not a fan of the green tea ice cream.  All that taken into account, I like a well oiled machine and Nobu is. Our waiter was very knowledgeable, personable, and prompt. When Nobu could've been stuffy and pretentious, it was an old friend putting you onto something new. I was impressed that the person keeping our water full knew the intricacies of the menu. That is a reflection of training and training is a result of an owner and management that demands greatness. I'm here for that. All I ask of a fine dining is that you live up to the price and Nobu does. I'll be back to order 1 of everything soon enough.",

    "text": "We had such a fantastic experience at Nobu. We had a 7:00 reservation on a Thursday night and were seated right away. I love the ambience in Nobu. It's dark and chic. Really nice for a night out. The service here is absolutely amazing. Our server explained the menu in detail to us, made recommendations and explained what Nobu is famous for. We didn't have an empty water glass or cocktail at any point. Our plates were changed to be fresh and we received new cutlery with every course. I was super impressed, and it really made the night amazing.   The food was also incredible, but note that you probably won't leave being super full. The portions are smaller. We started with salmon sashimi, which is seared a little bit with a delicious dressing. It was very good and fresh. The tuna tacos were simply amazing. The fish was fresh and it was just a flavour party in your mouth. The crispy rice with tuna is like a deconstructed tuna roll. It was interesting, but I'm not sure if it was good enough to order.  Nobu is famous for the black cod miso, and holy cow, it was absolutely unreal. The fish was buttery and had a delicious caramelization. Wow. It was unforgettable. The beef tenderloin was also great, but wasn't a super special dish. I would probably skip it next time and opt for more cod!",

    "text": "3 Stars - Reminder - 3 Stars isn't bad.   OFF THE BAT  The two most DELICIOUS bites on the menu is. TORO (OTORO? = Fattiest part of the Tuna) Covered in gold flakes, cavier, and truffle. The comparable bite is the WAGYU BEEF. Literally those are the two most delicious things on the menu, and trust me we tried over like 40+ different bites. I say bite because from the picture you can tell everything came in small bites.   AMAZING WAGYU BEEF. If I remember correctly its from Miyazaki Farms <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fswxj-AxPnXoD5_a7hVA8jg%2Fo.jpg&s=8585e603b7d34d284b259977fb4656010e34f629f9b7444d1bf62075555d76ef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media3.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>  Cool Story: Kobe advertise in America is actually Wagyu Cows. There's lots of farms that mixed Wagyu Cows with Angus Cows. Angus Cow Rib meat is very comparable to Japanese Black Wagyu Cows. In Japan Kobe Beef are just Wagyu Cows and Kobe, Matsuzaka, and Ohmi.   Nobu sells it by the oz and its 38 dollars per oz. In LA its around 30 dollars for 2 oz in most restaurants. At the grocery market it varies from 3-6 dollars per oz depending on cut.   Possibly the best Toro I have ever had <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FJM_eSP6vsBuYRgTIVKs2kQ%2Fo.jpg&s=8148351854ecd882d2721660eba76e6c2f8f0f89dab61b9122907c7b0b516bb0\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media1.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>  Very Very Comparable to the one I had in Japan at 5AM caught that day.   If you get it A la cart I think its around 28-48 and its definitely worth a try.  Coming in 3rd place for OUSHI UMAMI (Taste and flavor) would have to be the Yellowtail jalapeno sashimi.  2 x Omakase Signature (By Chef Nobu and its the same everywhere) (125$ Here ) Chef's Omakase (Head Chef's own menu tasting) (175$)  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FFKK_at23v2Q-w4yccShJcA%2Fo.jpg&s=32d992247c14bf72272daba681ce9283a06b50f049a055e0717cc506980f9d71\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a>  Prices are Post Tax add 50 for Tip  The rest of the meal was okay. Of the meal I think the only low quality fish was the Big Eye Tuna from Hawaii that was still fishy. The Aji (Jack Fish) was tasty and the Salmon was amazing.    There is a huge Variation of fish. From Steel Head Trout that looks similar to Salmon but much more lean (and chewy) to Black Cod sashimi and Fluke. A lot of the reviews mentioned the Miso Glazed Black Cod - For me it was too much flavor, like too salty. It looked pretty though. The Miso Black Cod part o the Nobu Signature Omakase however the fish for the Signature Omakase which I believe was Umami Sea Bass was MUCH MUCH Better. It wasn't too salty and cooked perfectly.   Note: My meal was not de-boned correctly  Here's a picture of the fish bone they said was a bamboo from the chopsticks <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2FGFMwo0PKZNpCd6ndk6-EXw%2Fo.jpg&s=ced9138a57940dde1f75f7baf89814be5f8c338b482c39620497eb07b1612877\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media4.fl.yelpcdn.com...</a> You can see there's still meat on the bone!  Manager Silva was a little patronizing but he did remove 50 dollars off the meal for the fish bone. (Mentioned EMT because the fish bone I chomped on punctured my mouth) - Makes sense right? I try to eat sushi the way it was meant to be eaten, 1 bite and I chomped on it. He offered a free bottle of Champagne which I did decline which is a super nice gesture. Although I totally understand his situation as he wants to crowd control their high standards.   Interesting Note: The group next to us ordered like 6 California Rolls.   Ending Notes: For 350$ You kind of expect there not to be fish bones in your sushi. Service by Jay was spectacular. He was very attentive and accommodating. Food Servers really explained the dishes well. The Variety is nice and overall the experience is a good one.   P.S. The Hostess was a TOTAL Bitch. Reservation was for 6pm and I tried to be seated at 5:45 and she made up some B.S. lie that she cannot sit me because her employees aren't in until 6. I would understand if it was busy at that time but it wasn't. But that's not why she's a bitch, just the overall interaction was very rude.   PRO ASS TIP: If you want to try a majority of the menu, get both Omakase because you literally get to taste like everything worth trying.",

    "text": "My friends and I came here for the first time. We all decided to get the Nobu signature omakase for $150 per person. This comes with 7 courses plus soup and dessert.  I looked at a lot of reviews and pictures before going and it didn't look very filling so we ordered 2 of the yellowtail sashimi appetizers and were planning on ordering more food after we finished the omakase. Man were we wrong! We were stuffed and all of us can eat a lot too! So unfortunately we did not order anything else after the omakase. I don't remember the names of most of the dishes but most of them were good. We didn't really care for the shrimp dish. It was just okay, nothing special. The miso cod was good but very salty. The beef was very tender, even the well done ends were very tender and seasoned perfectly.  If I had to pick my top 3 favorite dishes, they would be our 2nd course (the radish wrap, surprisingly very flavorful), the toro with caviar on top, and the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno. The yellowtail just melts in your mouth and has good flavor. The toro with caviar tasted a little weird to me at first, but after my first bite it was really good. We were stuffed by the end of the courses and then we got a bowl of miso soup. That filled us even more and to top it off, we got a bento box dessert of chocolate molten lava cake with fruit and green tea ice cream. I usually don't order desserts at restaurants since I don't like sweets but this was the perfect sweetness, not too sweet.   The reason I'm giving them 3 stars is because of their service. I don't remember our server's name, but he took a good 15 min before he came to take our drink orders. Then another 15 min to take our food orders. We're all in college so maybe he thought we weren't going to tip him well? Not sure. But we still left a good tip. He had a big smile when he saw it. Our waters were not filled as often as we wanted. My friends with soft drinks got them refilled when they still had half a cup remaining...also the food was a 4/5 for us. There was too much ponzu sauce or whatever it is they use. It was overpowering on almost all the sushi dishes. I like to taste the unique flavor of different fish. Also, we wanted all sushi dishes but that wasn't allowed according to our waiter. Next time we would probably order just sushi a la carte since we don't want any hot dishes. But we probably wouldn't go back for the price we paid. You can get sushi that's just as good or even better for a lot less off the strip.",

We did the $125/head Omakase and had everything from tuna with rice cubes to sea bass lettuce cups served warm with a ginger sauce.   re ambiance, can't beat it : we had a round table in an alcove so it felt like we had a private room - They took care of the folks at the table who were not fish lovers, they had multiple backwaiters keeping us watered and plates cleared. They also responded so kindly when we had two latecomers due to a mix up in communications, and smoothly incorporated them into the table.  I would highly recommend this for a business function, these are professional servers who read the situation and responded accordingly. Well done- the only bad thing is that there's no way that receipt's going to get through finance and be reimbursed- $2500 after tip.I'm not sorry!",

Well, then the waiter proceeds to talk about how the menu can be a la carte or created as a tasting menu, and then went over pricing points, like, if we didn't want to have a nice, classy meal, we should do a la carte, but if we wanted to go above and beyond, tasting was the way to go.  AWKWARD. You never want to make a client feel like they can't order what they want, and you also never want to make them feel unimportant by, say, NOT ordering the tasting menu.   We, of course, ordered the tasting menu.  Beyond that snafu, our waiter had way too many tables and wasn't quick enough with our requests or needs. We would have likely had another glass or two of wine but he never was around. We had to wave him down for the bill. Unacceptable at this price point for any of that to happen.  The tasting menu was good. A variety of options for everyone - even the two people in our party who don't eat raw fish (sigh.) However, when bringing out dishes for the other four people at the table that ARE raw fish, bring out an option for those two. At the same time. This didn't happen and they often sat and stared while we gobbled down heaps of sashimi and the like.  I will say, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno was one of the best things I've ever tasted. If it's possible for fish to melt in your mouth, this did it. I've never had anything so fresh and satisfying. And that was the first course.  But based on service alone, I wouldn't return to this place. Or, if I did, I'd sit at the bar or at a table with a friend - not a customer dinner where we are made to feel awkward and not waited on to the standard in which we should have been.",

The Hamachi Kama still has quite bit if scale it's skin. Didn't realize until I threw a whole piece, skin and all in my mouth. The whitefish with ponzu was mediocre as far as taste goes. The shrimp and Maine lobster dish, was a disappointment.  For price you think they have more lobster. I literally counted 4 piece of lobster and 3 large shrimps. The enter plates was full of mushrooms, like it had huge sale and they was getting rid of surplus. Granted everything still came out all fancy and beautifully plated for their standards, but flavor wise very lacking. My husband favorite is the Black Miso Cod, last night it was overly too sweet. We didn't even finish it. Next time I'm stick with the one in Hard Rock.",

    "text": "Eating at Nobu is like breaking out an old record collection and revisiting classic tunes.  Sure, I can get dishes like yellowtail jalapeno, rock shrimp and black cod with miso anywhere now.  But there's a special, fuzzy place in my heart for Nobu...it's where I lost my \"upscale sushi\" virginity all those years ago in Tribeca.  Every meal in any location has always been awesome and never has let me down.  Just like vodka!  This particular location is very pretty and the big cocoon-like booths look really cool.  Why are they still at the Hard Rock?  Does Mr. Hard Rock have nude photos of Mr. Nobu eating at Panda Express or something??   They also have the most expansive menu that I've seen from Matsuhisa-san, so branching out from the oldies but tasties was a must.   Their version of hamachi kama was (yooda, yooda) the best I've ever had.  Impressive in size, the heavy on the salt based seasoning and brick oven baked flavor was outstanding.  The yellowtail meat was so tender that it had everyone gnawing on the bones with bare hands just to get every bit.  The server almost lost a limb when he prematurely assumed we were done.    After very little convincing, so minimal in fact that I think I exclaimed \"YES! THAT!\" while pointing at the guy as soon as he said \"chu-toro\", we got the daily special of the medium fatty tuna topped with truffle, crispy garlic and greens.  They were indeed a divine couple of bites that had me wanting more.  I love tuna more than life.  Even my car license plate says \"tuna\" in Japanese.  Nobu still delivers after all these years!",

I assume the establishments are the same in their methods, however, since this is a chain.   Verdict: Awful.   I would give it one star, except I am feeling generous today, unlike the portions at Nobu. And to be fair, I expected such. What I didn't expect was a sub-par sushi experience for the price and the hype.   The hubs and I are VERY experienced Sushi diners and we tend to eat high end. We know our hamachi from our bonito. We don't generally do the Western dip everything in (fake)  wasabi and soy. We prefer sashimi, but explore the interesting world of inari maki, temaki, Japanese warm plates, etc...  BUT THIS PLACE!  Our hamachi in sushi form wasn't fresh and the rice to fish ratio was off. Our seared (not mentioned on the menu that it is served seared) bonito was a little too seared and drowning in some type of nikiri that over-powered the fish completely.   This is to say nothing of what is supposedly Nobu's signature dish: Black Miso Cod. It is my understanding that he invented it, but I guess it has been perfected elsewhere because I have had MUCH better. Sushi Den in Denver comes to mind... The fish was just over-cooked to that point when cod changes from a delicate mouth-pleasing texture to a rubber tire. The miso sauce, however, was passable.   And the service was awesome. Um. NO. I'm only kidding. One of our servers (we had more than one) asked us how we felt about the cod and we were honest that we'd had better, but it wasn't terrible. Guess what happened next? We were treated to a very snarky come-back. WOW.   Bottom line, we wound up leaving without ordering much more, spent too much (which we ARE ALWAYS prepared to do for a meal which is worth it) AND wound up having a great dinner at Gordon Ramsey's BURGR.   You want good Sushi on The Strip? I recommend Shibuya in MGM Grand over this place without a doubt!",

    "text": "Nobu was one of the biggest restaurant disappointments for us ever.  Why? Let me explain:  Nobu pretends to be a traditional Japanese restaurant with Peruvian flavors. However, in reality it embodies everything which is wrong with American hip ethnic restaurants.   1. The food is simply not good. The seafood is only semi-fresh and definitely not at the quality level the price would suggest. 2. The flavors of EACH dish we had were totally overdone. Mostly the dishes were just over salted to the maximum. Others were super sour or too sweet. Japanese and Peruvian cuisines are known for preserving the distinct flavors of the ingredients - Nobu overpowered every single dish with the sauces and seasonings (yes even the sushi). The only dish which was okay was their signature black miso cod - but we definitely had better. 3. The service was ok but not great. Servers were rushed and didn't do a good job explaining their huge menu. 4. The interior of the restaurant feels like they are trying too hard to make it look \"cool and hip\". The setting inside is way too dark - I have seen 10+ guests using their cellphone lights to be able to read the menu. 5. Worst for my wife and me was that the quality of their ingredients were definitely way off. We are both very used to seafood and raw fish - but we both had terrible diarrhea right after the dinner.  Overall, Nobu felt like a Japanese version of the Cheese Cake Factory to us. A huge menu with okayish food but nothing is particularly good because they are trying too hard to appeal to the average American taste.  Definitely not coming back. Totally overhyped - there are WAY better options in Vegas at that price level.",

The most impressive part of the meal was probably the carpaccio type cold plates that made up the front part of the meal. Very interesting pairings of sashimi with citrus and chilies. Probably the best was the yellowtail with a paper-thin shaving of jalapeno and dressed with cilantro and yuzu ponzu. The warm preparations were also very good, but I was unimpressed with the \"signature\" black cod in miso glaze -- perfectly executed but quite simple and similar to many dishes I have had in Japan at far lower prices.   At $200 for dinner I would have been happy; at $300 it's just overpriced. Further, charging $10 a bottle for water (no complimentary water offered) is an insult to customers. Nobu is lucky he can cook.",

If money is tight, go and make concessions for other meals...it's worth it!   This was by a long shot my favorite meal in LV...probably one of my top two favorite meals of 2014 so far.  The food is incredible, the atmosphere, music and general ambiance, is both sexy and fun.  I would have gladly eaten there several times if I had unlimited funds.  I have always been interested in Nobu  during my many trips to NYC.  The locations there are very hard to get into at a decent hour, so when I was easily able to score a table at the location in Caesars at a prime time it was a no-brainer.  We had many different items...all were incredible...but here were our favorites:  Miso Marinated Black Cod--plain and simply ridiculous eating pleasure...hard to explain how good this is.  The fish is cooked perfectly and the top is almost like a creme brulee from the miso marinade.  Crackly, sweet and a perfect match for the succulent, luxurious black cod beneath it.  Crispy rice with big eye tuna...a  phenomenal combination of sushi grade tuna and crunch.  Mini bite sized tacos, salmon and wagyu...perfect crispy meat filled bites.  They are small, but flavor and texture perfection.  Yellowtail Sahimi with jalapeno--doesn't sound special, but the glistening, fresh fish, sitting in a delicate citrus sauce, with the slightest slice of jalapeno on top is flavor magic on the tongue.  The yellowtail is mellow and smooth, with a hint of sweet and acidic citrus and a touch of heat from the pepper.  Better than I could ever make it sound with words.  Finally dessert...Nobu Shaved ice...this one again on paper did nothing for me...Shaved ice, with condensed milk poured over it, toasted coconut, bean paste and tofu ice cream...doesn't even sound appealing in all honesty...I couldn't stop eating it!  I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Had a very enjoyable dinner here during my girls weekend in Las Vegas. The service is very good. The servers pay attention and my water was never left empty (which doesn't happen most of the time). The lychee martini was very good, the alcohol was not overpowering with just the right amount of lychee juice. We ordered:  1.  the oyster shooters--- my first time trying this dish and it went down so smooth.  2. Yellowtail with jalapeno- fish was very fresh and the sauce was light and flavorful. This was very good!  3. Steamed Cod- This tasted just like sea bass. The fish was fresh and very meaty. Lots of flavor and very moist. It was garnished with pickled ginger- this was the best ginger I have ever had!  4. Steamed Seabass- After trying the cod, the seabass did not compare. It was served in a bowl with a soy based sauce- garnished with enoki mushrooms and bok choy. I didn't really care for the sauce. I felt that it took away from the flavor of the fish.   Overall, the food was very good. Would be a place I would go back to again on future visits to Las Vegas. If I had to recommend one item on the menu from what we ordered, it would be the Steamed cod.",

    "text": "What can you say about Nobu at Ceasers Palace other than this place is incredible!  AN and I were in Vegas on business and we have a little tradition, we always have pizza and sushi where ever we go! So while looking for the best sushi in Vegas I kept hearing NOBU!  We made reservations for 8:00pm and our driver dropped us right at the door at Ceasers, when we walked into Nobu it looked amazing, you could see the sushi bar with the sushi chefs working, the ambiance just felt trendy and modern with an upbeat energy.  We were quickly seated and our hostess looked at me as I sat down, she could tell right away I was not happy with our table, she asked if everything was ok, it was not, and I asked if we could have another table, and I  told her where we would like to sit, she informed me it would be another 15 minutes but quickly informed us she would escort us to the bar and make sure we were taken care of and get us the table I wanted.  9 minutes later the hostess was back to the bar with a waiter to bring our drinks from the bar to our table and our hostess escorted us right to the table I requested.  Our waiter promptly arrived taking our drink order of a bottle of water chilled and another glass of wine for AN.  He went over the whole menu answering all our questions and asking us what interested us and what stuck out, AN and I told our waiter what we were interested in from the menu and he asked if he could make some suggestions one of which being Omakase where you allow the chefs to custom create a full NOBU experience!  AN and I looked at each other and didn't have to say a word we both knew we were going with that amazing experience!  When the first plate came out of yellowtail sushi with caviar and 14 karat gold shavings I knew we made the right choice, and plate after plate of the most amazing food experiences we've had in a long time came out, sushi and Wagyu beef flambeed table side for 37 seconds.  It was an amazing experience!  The waiter does ask you a few questions before hand if you go with Omakase because our meal for the two of us before tip was over $800.00 but that's part of the questions to inform you of what the cost is.  This evening was amazing from the food experience to our amazing waiter, the ambiance was perfect and Nobu at Ceasers Palace Las Vegas is another favorite, we will come here again and I highly recommend Nobu!",

Once we studied it, we decided that two of us would share traditional California Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll sushi to begin. These were very fresh and very good.  It was probably one of the best but not the best we have had. Then, these two would share the Shrimp and Lobster with Spicy Lemon ($38). It was served in a small deep dish skillet with veggies. It was a good size dish actually. I was afraid we were taking a risk to share, but it worked out. It was more pepper than a spicy with the lemon flavor. It was good but not over the top amazing.   The other person ordered miso soup. She liked it fine. She ordered chicken and veggie skewer ($15 ea) and white rice. She liked it well.   Glass of wine ranged $15-$19 each. I had the $19 Russian river glass. It was great. Various cocktails looked fun.  Final bill was approx $60 each.",

    "text": "\"I hate sushi.\"  That was me earlier in the night, when looking at the menu.  I was in Vegas for a week and it was our last night.  My friend really loves sushi and I wasn't that hungry, so... fine.  Nobu.  Truth is... I'd never actually had sushi.  I had some lobster roll once and couldn't get past the seaweed wrapper.  Almost turned blue and, well... it wasn't pretty.  Anyway... they seated us in the lounge area in a huge booth.  No one behind us.  Clear view of the entire place.  Felt like we had the best table.  I scanned the menu to try to find something I would actually eat.  Wagyu.  That works. Chicken, too.  Shrimp Tempura.  I can do that.  The server (super hot; in fact... all the servers are ridiculously gorgeous)  was convinced that I'd like sushi if I just tried it.  I explained my issue with the seaweed.  She smiled (knowing what an idiot I am, of course) and said rolls are one way to eat it, but that I needed to trust her.  She said her brother hated it, as well... but once he tried it... he loved it.  She suggested the \"Omakase\" - a tasting from across the menu.  You give them a price point (ours was $125 per person).  They ask if you have allergies, what you like/dislike... and you get a series of signature items delivered over the next hour. Ordered a lychee sake and... as I looked around, I realized that it was our last night and this was a nice place. Ok.  \"Amazing\" is an understatement.  One of the best meals I've had.  Ever.  The first dish was the yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno.  Wow.  It was incredible.  Next up was a red snapper sashimi with lime.  Another sashimi... this one salmon with sesame, ginger, and green onion.  Then came the beef tenderloin (my least favorite dish of the night), followed up by black cod miso (wonderful flavor), creamy/spicy shrimp tempura, and then the sushi... albacore (holy mother of god this was good) and bluefin.  The final dish was a dessert... chocolate cake and green tea ice cream (with berries).  Topped it off with an espresso and called it a night.  With tip, the bill came out to about $450 for two.  A lot of money, but... it was a terrific experience and now I know I like sushi.  Highlights...  Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeno Albacore sushi  Lychee sake (had a few; they were about $20 each) Servers (what? eye candy is nice, too)  I'd like to try the wagyu tacos.  Needless to say, I'll be back.  Consider me converted.",

On the plus side, the fish was of high quality and very fresh. The presentation was very nice, and the service was good (but not fantastic).

The teppanyaki starts at $90 per person and goes up from there; we got the $140 plates and I know there are more expensive ones.  For that we got two proteins (me fillet and scallops, her sea bass and shrimp)  everything was cooked perfectly, and if you are a scallops or sea bass fan you know how difficult that can be.  The crab fried rice and miso soup were served afterwards so as not to fill us up before the main meal and the cake and ice cream in the bento box for dessert?  The illustrious girlfriend doesn't like chocolate and it was so good her box was spotless.  Here's the thing, they use the choices cuts (no tail of collar meat on their seafood) and they truly understand that freshness and quality are ingredients as much as spices.  They also value the experience.  No knives flying around like a Benihana.  Each item was cooked individually and is meant to be savored.  Their crab fried rice ... I don't know how they got such a luscious mouth feel with only a little butter.  The teriyaki is simply the best.  Their wasabi sauce is phenomenal and not spicy.    In short, I have been informed that everytime we are in Vegas, we are eating a dinner her.",

The one thing I really noticed is the lack of skill in the sushi chefs.  Their hands were clumsy, slow and awkward.  I'm surprised that such a name like Nobu showcases such subpar culinary skill.

    "text": "If I could I would give our March 2014 meal at Nobu @ Caesar's Palace 0 stars for service and 4 stars for food; 2 stars is my compromise. The exceptionally high prices are a given. Our lunch for 4 cost $500, and we weren't too full to skip dinner. The food, in general, was very tasty. Surprising standouts included the shishito peppers and the spicy miso chips with big eye tuna. The kumamoto oysters were shockingly disappointing; without the salsa toppings, they would have been completely flavorless. The black miso cod was also disappointing, probably because it was not as warm as it could have been. Which leads me to the real problem with the meal--the service. Our waiter, Ryan, was exceedingly condescending from the get-go. Beyond that, he spoke way too fast (and this was the consensus from 3 New Yorkers) while also failing to enunciate. He arrived at the table with way too much attitude and launched into his poorly delivered spiel despite our telling him that one of our party of four was in the rest room. When that person returned, he was less than willing to fill her in on what she'd missed. Ryan kept wanting us to let him design our menu, but since my preference would have been to see him fired on the spot, I was not inclined to let him choose our food. I cannot overemphasize how much undeserved attitude Ryan was dishing out. Our group had never seen anything like it, and between the four of us, we have eaten in great restaurants around the globe. Beyond the service problem of Ryan himself, we were also quite unhappy about the tremendous speed with which each course arrived at the table and the equally swift way in which even not yet finished plates were whisked away. One could either eat one's food as quickly as possible, without having the opportunity to savor it, or let it sit on the table, growing cold, as my black cod did. I've had significantly slower fast food. In general, I don't like to rate the quality of a restaurant based on its service rather than its food, but in this case, the horrendous service made the food much less palatable. Nobu management should be embarrassed by the restaurant's service failings.",

We got right in at Nobu without a reservation and sat at the Sushi bar. It was very cool to watch the sushi chefs at work. We had the yellowtail sashimi which was very good. Normally, I wouldn't touch sashimi, but this is Nobu and nothing here will disappoint. My husband and I shared 4 sushi rolls and that was plenty of food. Excellent service. The only thing is that it is quite crowded and loud in there, but still a great place for a very nice dinner.",

My girlfriend and I didn't really get to test the entire experience, because the experience from the beginning was a bit off.  Our server made us feel rushed. He had understood that we have been to other Nobu locations before, but didn't make for an experience worth repating.   We ordered some of the traditional dishes along with the traditional mango passion fruit martini, and was disappointed with everything. Not saying that anything was bad, it just wasn't up to the standards that this brand has built us up to.  It would be difficult for me to return to this location, but I will not stray away from the the other Nobu's I've been to in the past.",

    "text": "I came here with two friends to celebrate a birthday. The decor is pretty, ambiance is nice (not too quiet or loud).   We ordered the miso black cod, some sort of shaved artichoke salad, shrimp tempura and California sushi rolls, and shared everything.  After finishing our cod we found a hair on our plate. We informed our waiter who immediately had the manager come over. He offered us a new plate, but since we'd already finished it that didn't make much sense so we declined. Even though that is seriously icky I have to say that cod was life changing. I'm not a huge fish person. It's not that I don't like it, but most of the time when dining out I choose something other than fish. This was amazing. Sort of sweet, not \"fishy\" tasting at all, very moist (almost oily) and flaky. My two friends who both love seafood said it was some of the best fish they've ever had. The salad was also wonderful. All the components were shaved so finely it didn't even feel like a normal salad. Sushi is one of those things I want to like, but most of the time I really don't. I think it's the nori (when I eat seaweed by itself I want to gag. It's like eating ocean water, and not in a good way). The sushi here, though, was perfect. Best sushi I have ever had, hands down. We finished off with a dessert sampler, and I remember enjoying everything, but the only dessert that stands out was a miso cheesecake.  Portions are average to small. We were not very hungry going into this dinner, but if we had come in with empty stomachs we would have left and probably needed a snack.   Prices are on the high end, not exorbitant, but I'd say the entrees average $40. Because the portions aren't large I could easily see spending $100+ per person, especially with drinks.  Even though finding a hair in our food was gross, I know that can happen, and the manager was really great, and comped the dish, so it really didn't mar our evening. Our waiter, however, was pretty rude following the incident. I couldn't figure out if he thought we'd planted it or he was annoyed we weren't ordering more, but he was warm at the start of the evening, and following that was pretty detached.   The experience here wasn't perfect, and they really probably deserve a 4, but the food was just so amazing that I'll forgive everything else.",

Nobu is a celebrity hot spot and not exactly affordable or worth it to us common folk. You can get a better omakase for a lot cheaper without the Nobu name.   Food wise, everything from start to finish had some kind of unnecessary add on or detail that made it exquisite. Most of it just tasted like ceviche haha but honestly the plating and the service and the experience was pretty impressive, but as for the food like I said you're not paying the $ just for food but also for the presentation.  Omakase included a few items not usually available to the general public such as the endangered blue fin tuna.   Enjoyed my experience, but would rather buy an IPad. Haha",

I was impressed with three of the dishes but found the majority of them to be extremely salty. A lot of the dishes, particularly the hot meat dishes, felt a little incomplete to me. I honestly think I would have enjoyed the dishes more if they were served with a side of rice but for some reason Nobu doesn't give you the option of ordering rice. Portions are teeny tiny and prices are steep. After dropping over $400 on our meal I had to have second dinner elsewhere right after which I was not happy about! Overall I'm glad I gave this place a try but I do feel that it is extremely overrated and overpriced.",

A great way to see the action up front and personal.   I went with the Omakase (Chef's Choice) 13 cold dishes 3 hot dishes Desserts  Here's the rundown: Cold dishes: Nobu Tako w/ Jalapeno Sauce - a great way to start things off.   Toro Tartare - Wow, melts in your mouth goodness.   Toro, Big Eye Tuna, Abalone, Tamago, Scallop w/ Fresh Pickled Ginger - this was the nigiri part of the meal. Every thing was great. Fresh, clean tasting sushi. Yum!!  Amaebi w/ Uni, Egg Custard & Snapper - the shrimp and Uni was ridiculously good. Egg custard was so creamy and tasty. The anapper had a yuzu sauce that was so good (and I don't usually like yuzu)  Xxx salad, Amberjack,  xxxxx - I didn't get the names on the last 3 cold dishes, but they were all good.   Hot dishes.  Grilled Diver Sea Scallop w/ Tomato Sauce & Chive Oil - Scallops were perfectly cooked, but that sauce was AMAZING!!  Wagyu Beef w/ Garlic Butter & Brussels Sprouts. OMG!  Melts in your mouth goodness. PERFECT!!  Ramen w/ Crab and Vinaigrette Broth. A nice dish to finish the meal.   Dessert: Sudachi Cream, Merengue, Hazelnut and Black Sesame Ice Cream - a Napoleon (sideways). That sudachi (Japanese Citrus) cream was delicious. Hazelnut provided the crunch. A thin chocolate sheet provided the sweetness. That black sesame ice cream is the BEST ice cream I've had in a long long time. It was creamy, not too sweet and the sesame flavor shines through. I highly recommend it.   Service was SUPERB! From start to finish, I was pampered.   For me, one of my dining dreams come True and it lived up to everything I imagined it to be.   My Rating: 5 Star Plus!!  Try it for yourself and decide.",

Except for the black cod, which was excellent, everything else was very average. The portions were downright silly. I don't know if you can slice a yellowtail thinner than they did and if they did, it would be an empty plate.  Now the worst - the prices, considering the above. We paid nearly $500 for 4 people. That includes a $60 bottle of Sake (I could be off on that price but that is what I recall). If the food was fabulous, $100 per person I can handle considering it is Vegas. But with average food and terrible portions, no way.  Do not intend to return here.",

    "text": "I have been to several Nobu locations and this was my least favorite of all of them. Service was ok (not AMAZING like other locations), the chef we had seemed like he was new, quality was definitely not up to par with other locations, and it was so jam packed full of people it wasn't even enjoyable.    Other Nobus, they let you savor everything and encourage you to take your time which enhances the experience...at this one, I just felt rushed. And did I mention jammed in like a sardine? (Although those would not be welcome at such a swanky place)   Another annoyance: every. single. recommendation the waiter made was literally some of the most of expensive items on the menu (like...2-3x the price of the average). I mean, if I go to Nobu I expect to light some money on fire but if I followed his recommendations, it would have been $300 a person before cocktails. *smh*  When the waiter wasn't trying to inflate his tip with 1%er recommendations, ironically, he was completely missing in action. The bussers were fantastic and attentive though.   Needless to say, I won't be returning to this location. Get an Uber, go to the Hard Rock location where the ambiance is entirely different and the service and quality are some of the best you will ever have and truly up to Nobus standards. This location definitely lowers the bar and is not up to the standards we've experienced at other locations.",

    "text": "I've had three meals at Japanese restaurants in the last two weeks and this one was the best.  The food was great and service was outstanding!  I made a 5 PM reservation because I wanted to have plenty of time to do one of the omakase options and I wanted to have enough time before the 7:30 show at the Colosseum.    Matthew was my server.  He explained the menu to me after I was seated and then he answered questions I had about the omakase and the time requirements.  I ended up with the Signature omakase which consists of 7 courses plus dessert.  Two hours later, the meal was over and it was excellent.  Course 1 was a vegetable temaki.  Thin, long pieces of vegetables in very tasty nori.  Course 2 was the Nobu sashimi salad.  I don't remember the names of the different fish for several of the courses.  Suffice it to say that the salad was plated nicely and the fish selection was good.  Course 3 was the sushi course with nigiri sushi.  Besides the sushi, there was a cube of crispy rice topped with salmon tartare and some roe.  I was advised to eat the sushi from left to right.  Everything was excellent and the crispy rice finish was superb!  Course 4 was the last cold course.  It was called the tartare course and there was a salmon tartare in the center in a homemade ponzu sauce, yellowtail to the left, and a whitefish ceviche.  The courses represented the chef's time in South America and had excellent flavors.  I was advised to eat the tartare first.  I was given a small serving spoon to carefully spread the roe on top and then advised to dip straight down and have some roe, tartare, and sauce with each bite.  Excellent.  Then it didn't matter which side I ate but they advised that is save the yamamomo, Japanese mountain peach, for last to transition to the next course.  Course 5 was the first hot course and it was black cod miso wrapped in a leaf and opened by the server at the table.  The fish was superbly cooked and was very tasty.  Course 6, the second hot course, was beef tenderloin with enoki mushrooms and an asparagus spear.  It was brought with a napkin covering the top to protect the server as he lifted the top off the cast iron pan.  It was steaming it was so hot.  The flavor was marvelous!  Course 7 was back to a cold course.  This was a small serving of green tea noodles in a delightful sauce.  Dessert was a bento box with a chocolate cake with a scoop of green tea ice cream and some fresh berries.  It was a fairly light and delicious way to end the meal.  The time passed quickly, the food was great, and the service matched.  The restaurant became quite busy.",

    "text": "Nobu has it all - celebrity guests, a famous name, wonderful food and a HUGE price point.    We had a group of 10 that included family and friends, so instead of ordering a la carte we went with the Nobu Signature option on the Omakase menu, where the chefs craft a custom menu in real time based on our group's expressed preferences, allergies, etc. The price per person was big but since it was basically all-in and we were there for a special visit, why not.   The food was 5 stars. The miso cod was fantastic, the wagyu beef tacos were amazing, the yellowtail sashimi with jalapenos were divine, the grilled premium Japan wagyu beef was delicious and the dessert assortment they brought out was one for the ages. Best bite of the night was the first one - the salmon tartare topped with caviar in a wasabi soy broth with a mystery berry of some unknown origin (unknown to me) on the side - that dish was superlative-worthy on its own.  I didn't love our shrimp dish, but that good was far outweighed by a whole lot of great.   The cost ended up being crazy high.  My buddy handled the accounting but what I think happened was that on top of the Omakase went the pre-order appetizer and the cocktails. And when the server suggested the sake that she said paired great with the desserts, we didn't realize it apparently wasn't part of the prix fixe menu.  Either that or there was some sort of misunderstanding.  No regrets. Had a wonderful, truly memorable meal with a great group.  Worth (almost) every penny.",

Our routine has always been to dine at our longtime favorites (Craftsteak, Mon Ami, Mesa, etc) and to also try a new place or two. Nobu has always been on my \"to try\" list, so I made sure to call a few weeks ahead of our trip to make a reservation. I am so glad that I did! Nobu is probably the best Asian centered dining experience I have ever had. The food matches the visually stunning dining room in both presentation and taste. Our server was incredibly helpful, going to great lengths to make sure our orders matched our dining tastes and expectations. I especially enjoyed the black cod miso, rock shrimp tempura, and scallops in spicy garlic sauce. I am pregnant, so I did not get to experience their world famous sushi, but my husband and dining companions assured me that it did not disappoint.   For the reviewers who complain about Nobu not being a good value, or that they left hungry...Nobu is not the type of restaurant you go to for value. It is meant to be a culinary experience. You should only go if you can easily afford it. We spent about $175 per person on our meal, and left with zero regrets. We will be going back to Nobu for another great dining experience first chance we get!",

My dream still includes hitting the Tokyo Nobu and the Monte Carlo Nobu...  This location is new - anytime I was in Vegas, I would hit the Hard Rock location and it was awesome. It's smaller, more intimate in nature and the servers are hot and usually have accents.. (a plus)  This location is great for larger parties though, we had 60 people in our group and they had a room that accommodated us nicely.  Huge round tables with \"lazy susans\" were situated in partiality secluded nooks that were open to the center of the room where more rounds and one long table were setup. This allowed us all to move around and mingle but kept the over all noise level down. It was both a big party and an intimate one.   They also have a dining room for dates and small groups that has some great nooks and intimate little areas to talk and be with that special someone over some sake and sashimi..  The bar is very cool and they have some awesome cocktails to try. I had something I  loved but unfortunately, I cannot remember the name of it.. it has an orchid on it though and is served in a martini glass.. so describe that if you love sweet drinks with a little bite!  My favorites remain the same:  Yellow tail with japapeno Black cod Sashimi Tacos and the Kobe on a hot rock  See you there!",

The place is beautifully decorated with cloud paper lights and basket weaved birdcage seating...very Zen like but wouldn't have expected any less. Ive been to the Miami Nobu and was equally impressed. Our server was great, very engaging.   We got the squid pasta donburi which had the most tender pieces of squid. You mix everything together and the garlic soy and seasonal veggies (asparagus, shitake, squash, broccoli) really came together well. Add a little oshinko and mmmmm mmmm.  We also were ecstatic that they had the bento (only offered sat/sun for lunch) which includes all their signature dishes including the miso black cod and the creamy/citrus rock shrimp tempura. A good \"bargain\" to try out a variety of things. The bento also included sushi but I was not that impressed as the nigiri were tiny and salmon roll generic. All lunches include miso soup and pickles is an added bonus.   This is one of the better sushi places I've been in Vegas and a must try if you want to spoil yourself.",

    "text": "$36 Black Cod Miso $20 House Special Roll $36 Wagyu Toban-Style $10 Selection of 3 ice creams $12 Yellowtail Jalapeno Roll  I would try this place again to see if their other famous choices lived up to the hype, because honestly, the Black Cod Miso was not to my taste. I could tell the fish was very well-cooked, the way the flesh slid perfectly along its grain (pardon any incorrect nouns), but whatever umami moment I was supposed to be having, I was not. The same happened with the wagyu-beef. The flavor was very similar to an iron-plate steak I had before, an off-shoot of gravy with a stronger taste of onion. Anyways, didn't like it. What I ended up eating was the house special roll. It was like a rainbow roll, but with the assortment of fishes on the inside and the outside wrapped in a crunchy radish paper. Pretty good, but if I was going to get $20 sushi, I would rather go to Maestro's. Their rolls are more than good, they're awesome.   The best thing I had there was the ice cream: hojicha, matcha, and avocado. They had some weirder flavors like bubble gum, banana, and peach cobbler. The ice cream was smooth, silky, and creamy. Plus, the tea-flavored ice creams were spot on.   Service ====== A little on the slow side. We had to request extra wasabi three times before it got delivered. Same with asking for the menu to add on items. It took a good ten minutes, and I was severely tempted to go grab a menu myself, seeing as how I knew exactly where it was and it was within eyesight to mock me.   Decor ====== Dark, fun, possibly romantic. They also have a lot of fun with strange lamp-like shapes for the alcoves and the lamps are a little like jellyfish pods. Interesting, with a nod to Asian influence.",

From the moment we walked in the service was wonderful.  Hostess was friendly and professional and quickly lead us to the table. Our server was wonderful recommending the menu and prompt with our drinks. Everybody that we had contact with was very nice and knowledgeable about the restaurant and menu.     We had the opportunity to try the teppanyaki- this is not your traditional scramble of vegetables, shrimp toss and poorly seasoned teriyaki steak stirfry. No sir, they created a truly memorable experience.   We had shishito peppers cooked in front of us with truffles, yellow tail jalapeno (to die for), Sashimi salad, Sea-bass with cilantro dressing and roasted tomatoes, Kobe beef with Nobu dipping sauces (cooked perfectly and such high quality beef, not the Kobe at the local teppanyaki house), Iberico ham fried rice, grilled vegetables with red onion salsa, Tempura king crab (the sauce is so good), Miso soup and Japanese whiskey cappuccino for dessert.   I can not wait to go back!",

They weren't very big though and  we all had very big appetites. Service was exceptional we had a very attractive waitress who was extremely attentive to us filling water glasses and drinks. She was also flirting a lot with us and was wearing a rather low cut dress which left  little to the imagination when she would bend over to fill or water glasses she was almost exposed. Needless to say she got a really good tip. LOL  By the gentleman that took us to dinner there. My only complaint was that is was a bit noisy and that the portion sizes could of been bigger for what we paid for the meal. We still were hungry when we left from there.",

We both eat out a lot and love to dine at sushi places all over the country.   To keep our input brief, I will share the good and not so good aspects of the visit.  Good:   Quality sushi and special bites   Decent ambiance  Not so Good:   Major push to upsell you on items   Saki bottles are marked up 7 times- look them up for yourself   Service was horrible- wrong dishes brought out and 20 minute wait for drinks   Management staff seemed clueless",

Serving tasty food in small portions so I can try a variety of dishes, fresh and delicious, especially the miso black cod, it is to die for, I tried to cook this dish at home, it doesn't come out the same. Wish there was a Nobu close to where I live so I can get my fix! Much better than Morimoto in my opinion!",

    "text": "Wow. Just wow. this place is amazing. Pricey, yes but the quality is AMAZING.   I had the following (Ones with the '*' are a must have)  - Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno * - Black Cod Miso * - Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic - Akadashi Soup - Shrimp Tempura Roll* - California Roll  Let me just say, I went in there not liking raw or cooked fish. This experience completely changed my mind. My waiter insisted that I try the Yellow Tail Sashimi with Jalapeno and the Black Cod Miso. I had a YOLO moment (yes I said YOLO, I know, I'm very cool) and went a head and ordered it. I always thought that raw fish would be very fishy but, this dish was so fresh and expertly prepared it had no fishy taste and a very nice buttery mouth feel. Then the Black Cod Miso had a very buttery, melt-in-your-mouth texture. The flavor was very umami with the caramelized miso and the saltiness from the cod.   The Squid 'pasta' with Light Garlic was very creative. The squid very much well resembled a pasta such as an Orecchiette or a Cencioni shape. The vegetables did not fit in with the Japanese/ Peruvian influence theme but over all, it was a great dish. The Soup was full of flavor and the seaweed was a nice touch.  They say that their sushi is not their specialty but believe me it was phenomenal. Since it was my first night of having fish I did not want to try all of the raw sushi so I stay with what I liked, Shrimp Tempura and a California Roll. They were both amazing.  This is a must go to restaurant if you are in Vegas. The atmosphere is trendy and it sets a cool dramatic mood.",
