    "text": "We ate here twice for breakfast. The service was good and there was a good variety of food but the quality of the food was only okay. The corned beef hash was the worst I've ever had -- it was so full of fat & gristle that two of us had to discreetly dispose of it in our napkins. We paid $68.10 for breakfast for 3 which we thought was high. We ate at a Denny's within walking distance on the third day for half the price although it couldn't compare to the quantity or variety of food at Flavors. If you're staying at Harrah's, it's convenient but I wouldn't make a point of going there if you're staying elsewhere.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this buffet before it was even called Flavors... Basically it's like an international buffet but the variety within each country is limited. The quality reminded me of hometown buffet, but it gets the job done of getting you full.  Came here during breakfast not really hungry. Stuffing yourself in sin city, what they hey? seems appropriate. There was nothing that I didn't try at this place. If you dined with me before at a buffet, you'd know I eat a lot (like there's no tomorrow). They had an omelet bar which seemed like a hit due to the line, but I'm against the whole waiting in line in a buffet while food is all around you.  I can point out many flaws of this place. Service sucked coming from a deaf server who worked as slow as a Windows 98 computer, prime rib was as chewy as the Trident gum I had in my pocket, scrambled eggs had a cake texture that you had to cut through, breakfast sausages had a casing stronger than my iPhone's, crab legs were puny, sushi tasted and looked like two colored lego pieces.   Couple of goods were the bacon, crisp, unburnt with a great porky taste. Broccoli were steamed to the right texture. The sashimi got me going back for more. I had a good 2 or 3 platefuls of these suckers. The best thing you can creatively make at this place is tuna w/ 'broccoli rice' wrapped in bacon \"sushi\". I also got bored with flavors from eating everything separately so I made prime rib tacos, mock sausage bacon and egg biscuits from McDonalds, vanilla tart using vanilla syrup and a heart waffle, and a sashimi sandwich with a dinner roll.   For about 25 bucks a head, you'll get full off of \"ehh\" quality food, but it gives you a reason to be playful as well because you won't feel so bad from eating plates of bland food.   P.S. - save room for dessert and don't eat here! They skimp on the sugar, oil, butter or something that has to deal with sweets' flavor. There's a Ghirardelli shop a couple steps from the buffet that'll oversatisfy your taste buds for sure.",

    "text": "Yeah well I liked it....a lot. So much good food. The atmosphere is that of Shari's or some diner lol, the only reason for one star knock off. But the buffet was tastier than others, including the fancy one at my hotel, Wynn. Though they raised the cost a couple dollars at The Flavors which was completely and totally unnecessary.   The French style desserts were amazing and tasted like they were made by French pastry chefs trained in the best culinary French schools, like Ratatoulie! I have tried creme brule all over PDX, but this one made me weak at the knees! I continue to dream about it. And their little dessert with the berries and chocolate and cream inside, it's too pretty to eat but I still did it. The rest of the non dessert food was tasty as well, nothing unusual, all regular stuff but yummy and that's what matters most. I couldn't even try it all, dang my small stomach. Next time I work on expanding it's size prior to the trip. I just wish that the crab was easier to open with those nut crackers. Too much work. I need to try more buffets, but I think this score will likely remain the same even graded on a curve, unless they make changes to the food selection in the future that I disapprove of.",

    "text": "This is a review for Breakfast.  I haven't been here for lunch or dinner and the pricing is different for both.     Flavors buffet at Harrahs Casino for breakfast was excellent.  The line wasn't too long and it was reasonably priced for a buffet in Las Vegas.    There were just a few things to understand for this level of buffet.     1. It's a buffet.  Everything is cooked institutionally.  2. You can find better buffets if y you want to spend exorbitant amounts of money. 3. There are just some things that should never be institutionally cooked. .. like eggs benedict.  Other than that, here are a few things that Mabee this buffet great.  1. They had miniature Belgium waffles with a variety of toppings, yum. 2. Egg station where they cook omelets and eggs any style to order. 3. Grits, oatmeal, and cream of wheat. 4. Good chicken fried steak and country gravy. 5. The parfaits, cupcakes,  and desserts were amazing. 6. Roast new york cut beef and kielbasa. 7. The servers were awesome.   They were eager to please and very attentive.   One of the most important things to do is to get a great deal.   $18.99 per person is a little high for breakfast.  If alone, get a player's club card, play a little and use your comps to offset the cost.  If you don't play, then get a card anyway and get the $1 discount.  If party of 2 then get groupon and $28.99 for 2 includes all you can drink mimosas or bloody marys.    There is a little confusion about Groupon calling this a half price deal.   The deal is with the alcohol.   It would normally be $18.99 plus $10.00 for the alcohol add-on.  Even if you don't drink,  it's still a good deal.  You save $9.  Overall, for the money, it's a great buffet, and perfect for those morning afters that Las Vegas is so famous for.  YMMV!  ENJOY!!",

This buffet had the typical American, Mexican, Asian, Italian, and Dessert station spread. The only food that I remembered distinctively were the grilled pork marsala, crab shooters (with imitation crab btw), and raspberry sorbet. Everything else was ordinary. The bbq ribs they had had great flavor but barely any meat! I Yes they do have crab legs but every buffet on the strip should in my opinion. For the desserts, they have a lot of cupcakes and bags of cotton candy! Overall, this buffet is alright but the buffets at Bellagio, Ceasars, and Mandalay trump this place easily.",

I'll just say that Purina must be their food supplier because it was dog food at best.   - flavorless skirt steak at the carving station - mussels that looked like they were cooked 3 days ago - sloppy, uninspired, visually nauseating \"Asian\" and \"Mexican\" dishes - polish sausage looked good, but I was unable to chew more than once before spitting it back on my plate - oyster shooters (which I typically love) looked terrifying - I'm almost sure the Bloody Mary's in my \"all you care to drink\" add-on were virgin, and to give them any flavor at all you had to spice them up at the laziest Bloody Mary bar ever put together by human beings  The only bright spots were the salad which was a solid average salad bar (at least the lettuce was fresh) and the very above average dessert station.   I had a desire to eat at the adjacent oyster bar and burger restaurant during my stay, but was put-off to all food at Harrah's as a result of this lunch.   Caesars Entertainment should be ashamed of themselves for this display",

Visited on a Friday evening around 9pm when you would think a buffet would be at its best since the dishes are being refreshed frequently, but if this was Flavors at its best I shudder to think of what its like at its worst.  The crab legs were suprisingly good for a buffet, especially considering the quality that you get on the rest of the buffet.  Desserts were undoubtedly the highlight.  Small portions so you can try multiple offerings, and every single one of them was great.  Plus the gelato station was a great touch.    Nothing else on the buffet was even restaurant quality.  There are Italian, Asian, Mexican, and traditional American sections, plus a salad bar, and I tried a bit off of each section and there's not one thing that would have been acceptable if you ordered it at a restaurant.  Even the low tier buffet chains around the US like Golden Corral, Ryan's, Furr's, etc crank out better food than this.  Service was ok.  Great on refilling drinks but it took a while for used plates to be cleared.  If you're getting comped or gluttony is your thing then go for it.  Or check your insulin level at the door and splurge on nothing but dessert.  Otherwise stay away.  It's terrible.",

The food was either too salty or completely flavor less.  Their selection I suppose is good, it's just a shame the food sucks!!  But the water was good..hehe :)  I would certainly warn to stay away from the sushi.  The rolls we saw were dry and the avocado was browning...yeah brown!! No bueno!! The crab legs smell very fishy and the meat was chewy and rubbery.  Their chow mein noodles were hard and overly sauteed in garlic....yes it's possible to use too much garlic.  Seeing that we were not having much luck with the food we moved on to desert.  The ice-cream was ok, but then again how can you mess up store bought ice-cream.  Their custard was more of a jello grainy consistency, not custard at all.  Overall, this was not a good dining experience.

The ice cream waffle cones are great too.   hint... the half price tix place have discounts for this place on the weekdays. we paid less than $10 for lunch so felt like we got our worth just eating some fruits and getting lots of OJ! and we didn't have to wait at all.",

The buffet for one is $18.99 (I think), but we had a 'buy one get one free' coupon AND the player's card allowed us an extra $1.50 savings so after taxes, my husband and I ate for roughly $8.50 each.  The food selection was pretty good.  A little American, Asian, Mexican, Italian.....quality wasn't there but hey, you get what you pay for.  It was our last meal before leaving Sin City so we didn't want to eat too fancy.  Overall, the food was doable and the atmosphere was pleasant, oh.....and the service was great as well!",

Nothing to get overly excited about but it was a great way to start the day. pretty cheap for buffet but only because we paid the breakfast price and stayed through lunch.   The most standout item was being able to take cotton candy out of the restaurant. People on the strip were definitely envious of the fluffy pink confection i was dragging around. Or they just thought i was a freak.  A nice buffet option if you are staying at harrah's.",

    "text": "BAD food and the WORST customer service everrrrrrr!!!    My family and I have been to this buffet probably a dozen times in the past few years, but we hadn't been here in a while, so we thought we'd give it a visit.  We went on 4/3/12 around 5:30 PM.    HOSTESS WELCOMES US LIKE ZOO ANIMALS:  There was a family of 8 ahead of us, and then there was our party of 6.  When it came time to seat us at our table, the hostess decides to take both groups with her for seating.  She proceeds to have all 14 of us follow her clear to the other side of the buffet closest to the salad bar, to seat the company of 8, then she proceeds to \"double-back\" all the way towards the front near the chinese food area, to seat our remaining party of 6.  If I would have known that we were going to be treated like wondering, waddling ducks, then we would have dressed for the zoo-like occasion.  LEAPING LIZARDS, BENDABLE CRAB LEGS:  My parents and I started our meals with the crab legs.  They didn't have any crab openers available at the station, and when we asked our server for them, he treated us as if we were annoying him with our request, and told us to get them at the crab station.  So I go over and ask one of the guys behind the counter for the crab openers since there were none displayed.  In response, he mockingly copies \"my voice\" and \"small hand gesture\" of opening a crab leg, to his co-worker, asking where we could find a crab opener.  He then proceeds to walk behind a closed swinging door, to retrieve them.  By the time I got back to the table, our crab legs were cold.  Even with metal crab openers, we still had a hard time opening the crab legs.  Instead of being \"crackable,\" they were like rubber bands and \"bendable\".  FOOD HAS CHANGED TO BAD:  Nothing was tasty and delicious, as it had been in our past dining experiences here.  My husband asked for a \"thick cut\" of prime rib, he got more like a THIN SLICE OF DELI MEAT!  IGNORED OUR DRINK REQUESTS:  We asked our server for \"3 cups\" of coffee and a refill on a coke.  The server never brought us the coffee or refill.  But strangely enough, the server had the \"time\" to chit-chat with nearby Spanish speaking patrons for long periods of time, and even had the remarkable \"memory\" to grab some decks of playing cards from the casino, to \"shove\" them into the purse of one of the said customers.  It was great to see that he was bilingual, but somehow, someway, he felt that giving away the casino playing cards trumped our request for drinks.  Then, he DISAPPEARED FOR THE REST OF OUR STAY.  We ended up getting another server assigned to our table, who did bring us our drinks \"AFTER WE HAD TO ASK FOR THEM AGAIN\"... even then, it took another 2 attempts for him to get our drink orders right.  HIDING COTTON CANDY:  One of the appealing nature of their dessert bar is the ability to get cotton candy.  My 8 yr. old son and I decided to go get some.  At the time we were here, they didn't have the cotton candy visibly out, but instead HIDE them behind the counters, and in turn, requiring the customers to ask for them!  We knew they had the cotton candy because the customers sitting at the table beside us had scored some.  With my son standing next to me, I asked the lady scooping ice cream if I could have \"2 BAGS OF COTTON CANDY PLEASE.\"  She turns around, and what do you know, she only hands me 1 BAG OF COTTON CANDY.  Then she quickly turns away from me, to tend to something else.  So I patiently wait for her to return.  While I'm still standing there waiting, another couple come up beside me.  Upon turning back around, the ice cream lady simply ignores my presence and directs her attention at the newly arrived couple.  I interject with a POLITE \"excuse me,\" to which she responds to me with a \"WHAT NOW?\"   I continue to tell her that I needed 2 bags of cotton candy, and that she only gave me one.  She replies, \"You only asked for 1!\"   I responded back, \"I asked for 2, one for my son and one for me, MY SON WAS STANDING RIGHT NEXT TO ME WHEN I ASKED YOU!\"  As if I would have confused the notion of NEEDING 2 BAGS instead of 1, KNOWING my son AND I both wanted them.  Regardless of whether or not I asked for ONE or TWO, it was her duty to give me the 2nd bag WITHOUT her snarky attitude and responses, and most certainly, WITHOUT a fight!!!  My parents and I have lived in Las Vegas since 1978.  In the past 34 years that we have visited the numerous Las Vegas restaurants and buffets, we have NEVER experienced such POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE!!!  NEVER COMING BACK HERE EVER AGAIN!!!",

My husband loved the rotisserie chicken and pork. We liked the tamales and it was cheap! 16 bucks a person and if you get the free players card it's 2 dollars off.

    "text": "I saw the \"Buffet of Buffets\" listing on Yelp for iPhone while looking for a place to have breakfast after waking up around 3pm. (That's what Vegas is about, right?) It was rated 4.5 stars, and was supposed to be a good place to grab breakfast. (I figured there should be a better 24-hour breakfast spot on the strip, considering it's Vegas and the place is all about gambling/partying into the wee hours of the morning. I was hoping that's what this was going to be.) Man oh man, was I disappointed!  Going to the address on that \"Buffet of Buffets\" listing actually brought us to Flavors. So, I'm rating Flavors, and I'm going to go ahead and forgive that my expectations of finding a decent breakfast at 4pm might've been a little unrealistic. (Hey, I still think that'd be an attractive destination for a lot of people. A 24-hour version of San Jose's Bill's Cafe (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-san-jose\">yelp.com/biz/bills-cafe-...</a>) would knock the socks off of folks seeking a late breakfast on the strip.)  Here's what I found at Flavors. (Granted, it was 4pm on a Thursday. You may get better results at a busier time, but it wasn't an interesting enough place for me to bother giving it a second shot.) * Waited 6 to 8 minutes to be seated -- place was not busy and no one in front of us in line. Could've seated ourselves... * Lots of the food was way under temp. I'd say just about everything I tried except the soup were lukewarm and probably a food poisoning incident waiting to happen. * Cheese ravioli -- might've been good if not cold. * Penne pasta with alfredo sauce -- might've been good if not cold. * Italian sausage and kielbasa were OK but lukewarm. Would've been tasty if it were hot. But nothing special here. * Egg drop soup -- the base was unimpressive and did not seem very authentic, but they absolutely sank the ship by putting veggies in it that gave me the impression of Veg-All. * Sushi/seafood I didn't dare touch after finding how poor a state the hot dishes were in. * Fruit was OK but not a good selection (all they had was honeydew and grapefruit wedges). * Every type of bread I could find was stale/hard/dried out like it'd been sitting out too long. (The corn bread and dinner rolls both had this problem.) * Coffee was acceptable and, thankfully, nice and hot. * Had some vanilla ice cream for dessert. Had to ask the attendant behind the counter to scoop it, but that was OK, and she was very nice. Unfortunately the ice cream was the one part of my meal I really enjoyed.  Overall, the food not being maintained at sufficient temperature just killed this place for me. The price and service didn't do anything to redeem it. I personally wouldn't risk giving this place a second chance.",

    "text": "Yawn.  I wanted to go to what, in my head, is the best buffet in town (Carnival World at the Rio) on Chirstmas Eve of all days. I naively assumed that it wouldn't be THAT crowded, turns out the line for the buffet was almost at the door and the Rio was a total zoo that day. Since we wanted to get the Buffet of Buffets pass anyway, we decided to go to Harrah's since the shuttle stopped right there.......I really should have waited until tomorrow or have taken my chances with Paris or Planet Hollywood. Very disappointing, and not worth it's full price of $25 (which is, shockingly enough, the same as the Rio).  First off, the wait was much longer than expected, and it was largely because the line to get seated was almost as long as the line to pay. I understand that this was a very busy night, but we could see loads of open tables from where we were standing.  Secondly, HOW ARE YOU GOING TO HAVE A CHINESE SECTION WITHOUT EGG ROLLS? SERIOUSLY.   The only above average items in the buffet were the desserts (I know, everyone raves about the crab legs at this buffet, but the line for crab legs never seemed to end so I decided to skip it). 2 interesting things to note about this buffet are that they make and serve cotton candy and they are one of the few buffets in town to serve ice cream and/or gelato in waffle cones. You are also allowed to leave the buffet with them. I think I ate more sugar at this buffet than anything as everything else was so mediocre.   It's also quite possibly the most oxymoronic buffet in town. How are you going to have international stations and yet not even the basics of that cuisine are available (see: egg rolls for the Chinese section and tamales for the Mexican section). Thank god we grabbed the Buffet of Buffets deal, so at least we can easily make up for this disappointment.  *Our next stop is going to be the Le Village Buffet at Paris. Stay tuned.",

The best way to go about eating here - as with any buffet - is to go through once and have a tiny taste of EVERYTHING you think you may like. Then on the second round get a bit more of the things you liked the most. Don't pile your plate high with one thing then complain its a terrible buffet!! Variety is the key here. One thing will be cold or old but 9 other things will be great.  Without a doubt Paris is a bit better - crepes and dessets come to mind... Flamingo is a bit worse - just not popular so food tends to be old. Those are the two closest neighbors. Bellagio is tons better than any in the immediate area - but the wait is not pretty.

Service was slow but we were served by a sweet, genuine, elderly lady, which negated our opinion of the slow service.

There are many things that I don't eat, and the staff was very helpful in pointing out to me what I could and could not have. Very knowledgeable.

This last visit for a crab leg mission was a real treat as the succulence you brought to my mouth was simply mind blowing. Awwww the experience of sucking your sweet meat as the hot drawn butter type juice drips down my lips and chin. Oh how you almost drizzled so far down that you came close to ruining a new shirt.  Why oh please why do you and how is it possible to keep me so addicted? I truly deserve to know why this must happen to me? I really look forward to seeing you and devouring you Mr. Flavors buffet man.  All I can say is I want more HOT crab legs. I need more HOT crab legs to devour.  I go for the crab legs, my gal pal goes for crab legs and the all you can drink wine/champagne. She can drink two to three bottles in a visit!  It gets better as this succulent suck fest was completely free! I am a fatty and guys love to feed me :) It is a blast watching me eat and suck down all of that yumminess!  \"I did it all for the Flavors\" lol",

It shows the proper management & micromanagement: from Joy on down, Cheryl, Robert, Billy,  Phung & Manny. They are personable, pleasant & it's apparent they genuinely enjoy their jobs. Their jubilence is  infectious, yet not overly intrusive. The food is fresh, the crab legs are at your choice served cold or as hot as you like! I believe the only place that serves hot! Or at least at a buffet. The food is flavorful, but not overly salted.  The pastries & ice cream are made in house. I should have gone for the diabetic nightmare and started with dessert!

The meat are mostly dry and the vegetables are over cook. The food in general are very salty. They do have Dungeness crab and they will warm them up in a pit of hot water. That is nice. The crab, I think is as fresh as you can expect. Nothing compare to the ones we cook at home when we just bought the live ones from the market. Drinks are included. Salad selection is very weak.  I was in a hurry to catch a plane and ran out of time. Otherwise, I would go to some other ones who have better rating.  If you just want to get satisfied by a Buffett... I think it's ok. If you want an experience, go somewhere else!",

There are definitely a lot of choices here, such as pancakes, French toast, cinnamon buns, blitzes, fresh omelettes, ham and cheese croissants, biscuits and gravy, fruit kebobs, breakfast Stromboli, breakfast burrito and so much more! My favorite was the country fried steak, super tender, freshly fried and golden brown with amazingly rich gravy with pieces of sausage. Simply delicious. It has a an older decor and the only reason I give this buffet 3 stars is because this is in Vegas! Go big or go home! I would like to see more eclectic choices. We were sat in the back of the restaurant both times even though there were open tables closer to the buffet. It's definitely the way to go for affordability!",

The sushi is not impressive, but this seems to be a trait in the buffets I have been to in Las Vegas. I also noticed the staff is well trained; always kind and attentive.   What this place had that I have not seen in a while was a taco bar. I would suggest combining cheese and rice, usually is a good idea.

Bacon was fatty, pancakes were decent, strawberry cream crepe was so so, Belgium waffles (in a different section of the buffet) were not bad and had a fun card design, biscuits were dry, hush puppies were very dry and not much flavor, sauteed spinach was nasty, the Chinese food (all) was surprisingly very delicious!, somewhat of a variety of sushi, chefs special of the jambalaya was OK - rice wasn't dry but meat was greasy and fatty, chicken fajita mix was very dry, cornbread was not too dry and had a nice sweet taste to it, kielbasa was sweet but greasy, prime rib was mediocre quality, buttermilk fried chicken was low tier and not good taste, chicken bits were good! Tasty. Creme Brule was awful. My friend said the worst he's ever had. Shrimp were actually very tasty and had rich flavor. Cherry Danish had good flavor but a tad dry, apple Danish was bad. Chocolate micro cupcake was surprisingly pretty decent. Wish I could say the same for the vanilla. It was a train wreck in my mouth. Juices were good! Orange was full bodied (for a processed push button juice), cranberry was not overly tart or sweet. Perfect.  Gelato: mango flavor was off. Couldn't eat more than one bite. Uh why does the chocolate taste like BBQ smoke? My brain is confused. Cookies and cream was GOOD!! Worth getting a full scoop.  The brownie inside the glass that you have to ask for (why?) is horrid. Not worth waiting to ask for one let alone wasting the calories.   FYI bathrooms are a mile away and if they're closed like they were today you then have to trek upstairs.   Overall, I wouldn't pay more than $20 for this. Do NOT come here if you're just expecting breakfast. It's sadly lacking in variety.",

    "text": "I have never had an above mediocre experience at a Harrah's buffet. I don't know why I thought Harrah's Las Vegas would be any different.  We chose to eat at Flavors because we had a coupon and comp dollars. #bargainsbrunch #bottomlesschampagne  We arrived around 9:30-10:00 on Saturday for brunch and the line was not too long, but there was only one person working the register, so the line was just creeping along slowly. Being the hangry person I am, that never goes over very well.  I usually take a lap around the buffet before I make any final decisions. My initial reactions were not good, but we already paid the money so I did what I usually do at buffets, I BUST THEM. I took a little bit of everything that I could fit on my plate and returned to my seat. I try everything and if it tasted gross, or cold it was discarded. I continue this ritual for numerous rounds until I am somewhat satisfied with the mediocre food that has filled my gut. Unfortunately, that happened to be every single thing except the fruit and the salad bar.  The saving grace was the great service from our server and the bottomless champagne. The server even gave us to-go cups that we took with us out onto the casino floor.  Don't waste your money on this buffet, eat somewhere better... unless its free, then you get what you pay for.",

Upon initial view, you would think that you are about to get exposed to a lot of food, but truly, there are just a limited variety of foods that you are getting.  You basically have a Mexican station, Asian section, Italian section, and things off the grill.  Add some cold shrimp and crab legs and that is the vast majority of the food items.  Through in a huge assortment of desserts from ice cream to lemon tarts, and you pretty much have the entire food line up.",

It didn't help because the food is so bland you lose your appetite.   Ordered hot tea expecting green tea. It was Lipton black tea.  Best thing I had was the won ton soup.    Tried to find the restroom. Asked a waitress and she said it was outside in the casino. Why the heck do they do that? She told me to go out, take a left, pass the piano and I'd see it. Umm yeah... I never found it,  nor a piano. I wandered around a bit then came back and held it in until we were done eating.   At the entrance the staff were not friendly but not mean. Just kinda doing their job without a care for our convenience.   The meal times are crazy...  Breakfast is from 7am-11am, dinner is 11am-10pm. Dinner is twice as much as breakfast, and there is no lunch period. Gotta love Vegas.   Summary: it's a $25 buffet in Vegas. Good buffets are $40+ in Vegas. We only decided to try it because it was at our hotel. I won't be going back.",

Whether you've had a bad or good experience with Vegas buffets, you can't leave Sin City without going to at least one buffet.  Where else can you possibly eat the most random combination of food?  Hey, sometimes I like my French toast with egg drop soup and roasted corn.  This buffet was no Hometown Buffet.  It's right in front of the casino lobby and not tucked in the back somewhere.  The prices were average (cheaper than others) and the food was decent; I actually enjoyed it.  They have a lot more different types of dishes than other places - from Asian to seafood and even breakfast!  It wasn't bland and the food didn't all taste the same.  In addition, the service staff was amazing.  They were prompt with our drink orders and I never saw the bottom of my glass.  And OH!  This buffet had a chocolate fountain AND they serve cotton candy!  I've never seen a buffet that even had one of those.  My only complaint was that my strawberries didn't taste fresh and drowning it in the chocolate didn't camouflage it.  Other than that, I would be happy to come back.  It may not be upscale and fancy as other buffets, but it sure didn't have the price tag either.  If you're down in luck from gambling, might as well save the rest of your money and indulge to eat. =)",

The selection is miniscule & it pretty much sucked sh%&. Come on the place didn't even have pizza & for the lunch price of about $17 it was not worth it. I actually only paid about $12 cause I used some total rewards points & a coupon I got frm ballys, but not even worth that. Peeps, when u go to vegas & want a good buffet with a huge selection for a cheap price, take the free shuttle frm harrahs or ballys to the rio, walk next door to the gold coast. Gold coast has a good lunch buffet for about $8. Or go to the [rleans buffet, they have pretty much the same huge & awesome buffet for about the same price. The strip buffets are way overpriced. Even the excalibur has a better buffet! Save some $, if uw want awesome pizza ck out a little walk up place in the paris walkway to ballys. I 4got what its clld but its right across frm the paris buffet & its $10 for 2 big slices (the artichoke & margherite were fab) & a drink.",

    "text": "I visited Flavors during dinner time.   The service was excellent. Susan the cashier had a very Las Vegas greeting which I thought was creative and cute: \"have a lucky day.\" On top of that, the server/busses Adrian was also friendly  and without even me asking, he knew I had food that would be messy, so he placed some wet tissues for me. Quick and friendly service with a smile is very refreshing to see, and nothing less than the Caesar standard.  Now to the food: Not too often do I see a food that I want to try right away. Actually, what I usually do when I'm at a buffet is walk up and down the line and preselect my food before I get my plate. I do this because I expect the basic essentials of a buffet and I look at presentation and what's in the food before I select.  Not with Flavors.   As I did my walk, I found two items that caught my attention right away: Tilapia Shrimp Scampi and Chicken Marsala.   The Chicken Marsala was good: meat has enough juice and the flavors were there. The only semi-bad thing I can say is that the chicken pieces were a little too large. But overall, it was a good Bite.  On to the Tilapia: it was cooked just right. The only comment I have is that the butter flavor was a little overwhelming, even overpowering the pepper. I had hoped to taste a little bit more spices.   There are other items that I have tried that I won't comment on because I think this review is already long winded. Overall, the quality of this buffet is very good, with the potential of being excellent. The service is definitely there, it's just the food that needs a small amount of tweaking to reach that potential of excellence. Despite that, I would definitely come back.",

Even though they had great ratings and reviews, I was still in Vegas on a budget and dinner buffet prices are steep. Flavors is pricey as well but buying the Groupon, we still made out better than the regular price because AYCD alcoholic beverages were included.  The Groupon allowed us to jump in the reward member line and get special seating. It was great because the line to be seated was shorter. The service was very slow but the servers are very friendly. Maybe they were understaffed that night but we only were able to get 2 drinks a piece because the drink server pretty much had to serve our whole area alone. I guess it's good that we got two drinks a piece versus zero so the Groupon wasn't a total waste but I'm still not happy that I couldn't have more drinks.  The food was really good!!! There were so many options to choose from: Asian, Mexican, Italian, seafood, soul food. It was all delicious. I was so stuffed that I couldn't indulge in the desserts but my boyfriend let me try some of his ice cream and the strawberry ice cream was bomb!!  It would be great if they had a Groupon like this the next visit to Vegas because I would definitely come back. I would try to come to dinner early so I would have more time to indulge in food and drinks. Hopefully service speeds up as well.",

    "text": "Considering that buffets aren't usually the highest quality of food, I was actually pleasantly surprised at the amount of, well, flavor at Flavors. I didn't taste a single thing that was bland and some of it was even actually quite good. Plus, there's something for everyone with stations ranging from seafood to meat carving and Italian, Mexican, Asian and more. It was a bit overwhelming at first trying to decide what to eat because there's so many choices.   I started with a bowl of clam chowder that was very thick and creamy and a plate full of pasta, fried chicken and potatoes. I don't usually care for pastas at buffets but these pastas tasted great. They even put a fresh serving of chicken alfredo pasta out while I was browsing and the chef recommended that I give it a try. He did not steer me wrong. It may have been my favorite overall. Plate two included a small salad from the \"hidden\" salad bar, which is past the desserts on the left side. There's not a ton of toppings and I noted that there were no hard boiled eggs, which are my favorite, but everything was fresh.   Then I moved over to the carving station, which was the biggest disappointment for me. At Friday lunch, there were three pork options and one turkey. Seeing as I don't eat pork, I was a bit bummed that there wasn't more variety. I tried a slice of turkey but it was a bit dried out. Adding some mashed potatoes and gravy did help some though. It would have been nice to see at least a beef option too.   But my disappointment quickly subsided when I saw the expansive dessert section. The gelato was a welcomed treat and the fruit tart was delicious!   The biggest draw for the buffet was the added all-you-can-drink special. After all, it is Vegas! Our waitress did a wonderful job of keeping our mimosa glasses full. I must have had four glasses over the course of the nearly three hours that we gorged ourselves at the buffet.   Check out Groupon to save some money. We got the lunch buffet option for about $23.50 per person, which is a good deal when you consider it includes alcohol. Honestly, the fact that it included alcohol was the biggest selling point for us. The fact that the food was better than decent was just an added bonus.",

    "text": "I should've read some of the reviews before going to this particular buffet. Someone of a disappointment, paying about $39 for both fair that's probably worth only about $19.99 The food is the little mediocre the quantity they put out is great, the variety is great, but the quality is a bit pour. Especially for being a hotel on the strip in the middle of everything I would have expected the buffet to be of much more quality.  Granted the staff there is only two clear up plates and turn the tables over to the new patrons but the attitude they have is pitiful. If they don't like the job than they should leave their job because it seems like our particular person could care less slamming this is just being a horrible person at work. To give me an example the table next to us as they left a notice that they left their personal Shopping bag behind And when I went to advise the staff who I just was describing she said well I don't care I'm not gonna chase after them they can figure it out. Me and my friends looked at each other and we said, wow, really?!?!. Period. Perio and when I went to advise the staff who I just was describing she said well I don't care I'm not going to chase after them they can figure it out. Me and my friends looked at each other and we said, wow, really?!?!  Luckily one of my friends saw a girls by the desert area leaving and I caught up to them letting them know that the table that they sat on I think they left their personal shopping bag they thankful he went back and got their personal item and thank me, but it's disgusting to know that one of the staff at the restaurant could give a damn about anything. So because of her attitude and because of the way she was during our dining we did not tip her her added to suck and you know where the food wasn't as great either. I am sorry if you are in an industry where tips is part of your salary but with a horrible attitude you don't deserve even a dollar.  I will most likely not decide to come back to this particular book fair and not recommended, I'm sorry I apologize to the establishment but not a great experience.",

    "text": "This was the biggest disappointment of the trip. In the past, regardless of where we were staying, we would eat here at least once per trip. This is not the fanciest buffet, or the most expensive, but Flavors used to provide a good value for the money. I recommended this place to friends, and the six of us went for dinner. We found that the price had gone from the low twenty dollar range up to $36! That puts this middle-of-the-road buffet up in the Paris and Bellagio price range. Well we were here and hungry, so we paid and went in.   After being shown our table, I went directly to the crab legs, the man reason I come here. There were no split crab legs on ice, just a bunch of small I-don't-know-where-these-came-from crabs the size of my fist in a bowl. I was extremely disappointed, but took a plate of them back to the table. The crab was horrible. So small, they were impossible to get any meat out of. Also for $36 I expect the shrimp to be bigger and peeled, but Harrah's has other, lazier ideas.  I went back and got some Italian food, Chinese food, and made a trip to the carving station. The carved turkey was ok, but both the Italian and Chinese offerings were sub-standard, and there were not many selections. The buffet was barely worth half the price.  As far as service is concerned, there is none. In the past, a server would bring glasses of ice water, ask what other drinks (soda, coffee, juice) they could bring, and would clear your plates promptly. In return, we would tip pretty generous for a buffet. In Harrah's brave new $36 world, there was a collection of room temperature bottles of water left haphazard on the table, and you can get you own damn drinks. Because they have installed a Pepsi machine, Harrah's has decided you can juggle that back to your table too. Look, I can get my own drink, but when I pay as much as I did I expect someone to bring it. I also expect someone to take the dirty plates away, but the staff has been cut so low, it's not possible for the overworked staff to do so.  The very worst part of this whole fiasco was the fact that I had recommended this nightmare to other people, based on past meals. I was so embarrassed, I apologized a number of times.  If you look back on my complaints, it's apparent that this was not a one-off bad meal, this is the way they it is all the time. I don't know if Harrah's thinks it's customers are stupid, or if they just want to get one meal out of you before they burn you, but I am not going back. On top of that, I will tell everyone I can what a rip-off this place has become. We are Harrah's/Caesars Total Rewards members, and have been staying exclusively at Harrah's Vegas properties at least once a year. When we are in Lake Tahoe, Reno, or New Orleans we gamble at Harrah's. I feel so burnt by this, the next time we go to Vegas, I will make a point at staying at a MGM/Mirage property, or SLS, or anything that is not Harrah's. And if their management wants to contact me, you can reply to this review.",

    "text": "I had a very negative experience here. I had purchased a Groupon for the two person seafood brunch buffet, and when we got to the front counter, we were informed that they were not accepting any Groupons because of the holiday weekend. This was a little disappointing, but we understood and asked to use the face value without the discount, meaning we would just pay the extra on top of the voucher value. Instead of honoring the face value (which should never expire for any reason), the person at the front desk just kept loudly repeating BLACKOUT WEEKEND. Not only was this person rude to us, they also were speaking loudly and angrily at anyone who approached them with a question.   The service at the front was bad enough, but the quality of the buffet space was terrible. It looked like an old, beaten up cafeteria, and the drinks were all served in flimsy plastic cups that you would find at a frat party.   The only positives about this experience is that the (pre-frozen) crab was edible, and we had a wonderful server, Leo.   We will not be returning to this buffet and do not recommend it to anyone else.",

Marianne is an amazing individual.  Checked up on me various times to make sure I was okay.  I would come back here just because she's awesome!

    "text": "***2.5 stars*** I came in knowing that it wasn't the best buffet, but $27 seemed pretty cheap compared to other places on the strip.  I'm not a picky eater, just look at my previous reviews lol. I grew up poor so I know the struggle, and I wasn't looking for fine dining at $27. This place still disappointed me, though.  I was excited for the crab legs, but couldn't even eat them. They were too salty. Like a previous reviewer said, it's like they were soaked in salt water. On the other hand, the mussels were \"marinated\" but they were so bland! I'm a seafood lover, so this was upsetting for me that their seafood was not up to par.   Eating in Thailand, a third world country, was more delicious (not saying that the food in Thailand is supposed to be gross or anything, but cmon).   The rest of selection was okay, if a bit small. The Mac and cheese was creamy, the spaghetti was very flavorful, probably the most flavorful I've had! The tortillas were a little hard (not the hard shell ones but the ones that were supposed to be soft) so it seemed like they were left there for awhile. They only had chicken fajitas to fill them with also, which disappointed me. I love carne asada tacos haha.  The desserts were average. The ice cream was yummy and they had gelato as well. The chocolate mouse and mint mousse in the cups were plain, even according to my brother. The chocolate ecstasy was very delicious though if you're a chocolate lover.   Overall, it wasn't anything special really. I would give it 1.5 stars.  The service, like stated by previous reviewers is the reason why I gave the extra star. They were attentive and very friendly, though there was an elderly woman worker complaining about being tired within earshot. I know it was close to closing time, but you shouldn't act like that in front of customers. This is coming from a past manager in retail. Presence and attitude is key to a happy experience on the guest's behalf. That was the only person who wasn't very good with service. Special thank you to the Asian worker who was so funny and nice though!  I don't think I'll be coming back, sadly.",

    "text": "\"They have mashed potatoes!!!\" exclaimed a child to his grandparents as if it were Christmas morning.  I couldn't help but laugh.  Just a couple of minutes before that, my wife and I had our photo taken with a 5 foot spoon and fork that the resident buffet photographer then tried to sell to us for $25 during dinner.   I had a couple of comps for the \"Buffet of Buffets\" that were about to expire.  Even though we pretty much only do buffets when friends and family visit, we could not let these babies expire without using them.  The line for Paris and Planet Hollywood's buffets were over an hour long when I called so we ended up here.  No line!  No surprise.    We were last here 5 years ago and not much has changed.  The most significant thing was that they got rid of their chocolate fountain and now give out bags of cotton candy.  The best things were the crab legs which were larger and tastier than the ones at the Rio we had a day later.  I also liked the carving station and the dessert area so we mainly just filled up on those.  The salad, Mexican and Asian stations were all mixed bags.  I heard the mashed potatoes were great....  A family of 5 sitting next to us were already on dessert and as we were about to leave, the father got up to speak to the manager to complain about the pasta being cold.  He said it ruined their dinner so the manager fully refunded them!  They were already on dessert!!!  So for cheapos looking to take a shot, I guess you have a mark here.",

While I was there they were warming the plates of crab legs up for those that wanted them hot, which I opted for and I had no issues with them being dried out.  I didn't even use the butter for them as it was not needed.  I did the same thing with the shrimp, I prefer them to be warm and they peeled very easily so again, no issues there. The only complaint I really had was that the taco meat was a bit salty, other than that everything was very good and I will definitely be coming back during my next trip.  Also, the service was great, very quick at clearing our plates and filling our champagne.",

Fried chicken, mashed potatoes, Chinese food, breakfast all nasty! My husband said he liked the prime rib but I didn't get any because I was just totally turned off.

But that's okay because we had low expectations to start with.   Nothing special and we will not make a point to come back but we were here and ate for $55 tax incl for family of four which is cheap cheap in Vegas. Bogo buffet coupons w VIP tickets for the Mac King show. Otherwise the buffet is $24 each for dinner. So $55 for dinner for 4 was a great value for grub and go. It did the trick and we were out the door for more Vegas.",

I was staying upstairs at Harrah's and was hungry after a long flight flying in from San Francisco. I read the reviews on Yelp and the rating was fair when compared to the other buffets on the Strip. The Crab Legs and Mussels were overwhelmingly salty. I also go their Cocktail Shrimps and the sauce was just mediocre. Their Prime Rib was okay and edible. There were a few options of Chinese food such as Siu Mai, Fried Rice, and Chow Mein which looked very greasy. I also got their Linguine and Clams, this lack flavor. There was close to no service here, as they only cleared our table once from empty plates. Overall a huge disappointment from this visit, I felt that I could of used the $32 I spent here for a better meal. Food here was overwhelming salty and greasy.

Any buffet that has grits on the menu has my vote. My first plate was grits, bacon ,  scrambled eggs, hash brown potatoes ,  and the crossaint sandwich with ham and cheese, and orange juice. Everything was pretty good. I wanted a biscuit, but they were all hard, so I got slice wheat  toast.  The OJ was very fresh tasting and not watered down like some places. Also had fruit kabob which was good. Second plate was pancakes, french  toast  and bacon. The pancakes  were  good except  was hard, dried out around edges...guess because had been sitting out for a while. Did not like french toast at all...took one bite, and that was it for me.   As far as dinner, nothing  spectacular .  For me  the quality and taste  is nothing more than your traditional  buffet.  Doubt if I  would ever return.",

I ordered a Groupon for this place for dec 23 but not before calling to confirm that the Groupon was valid for that day. I was told by an employee at the buffet that it was a blackout day. That was a LIE! The lady at the front desk was so rude. These were her exact words.  \"Well you didn't speak to me\"  I specifically called ahead of time to triple check the Groupon rules and was lied to by the staff.  My party of 9 not only had to pay full price for dinner but a few of us were not able to get our refund from Groupon because the buffet lied!  They would not seat us together and their food was crap. It gave my auntie stomach poisoning.  We came all the way from Sacramento just to have the worst experience ever on Christmas. I spent 2 days being transferred around because no one wanted to help me.  I wish I could give this place negative stars. McDonalds would've probably been a better choice that's how bad this was.  Rude service! Horrible food! Overpriced! Scam artists!  Avoid this place at all costs!",

My husband was dissatisfied as well. Hats the point of paying so much money for something that was not good as before.  My teens said that the lack of customer service at the ice cream places lacked so much they didn't even want I get ice cream bcz the se bee seamed angry. We went to eat a great dinner and left hungry. Th macaroni and cheese had no flavor.  We will no be coming here again. Management please do something about it",

I mainly went in for the crab legs and other seafood and I enjoyed all that I had. I tried a few other non seafood things and wasn't that impressed with them. Then I got to my favorite part of the meal...dessert. I will say that they have some awesome desserts. They make their own gellato, but I wanted to try all the little desserts they had in the case. We tried one of everything and didn't find one we didn't like. I was especially happy to see that they had cannolis as they are one of my favorites. I also like that they have the soda machines where you can add different flavors because nobody has vanilla pepsi anymore and I can actually get it there.   Service: We had someone come to our table once, the whole time we were there to grab plates when she saw we had a bunch stacked up with crab shells on them and that was it. We had to go find where the napkins and stuff were and get them ourselves because nobody was coming around and we were eating crab legs and making a mess with nothing to help clean our hands. They make you get your own drinks so the servers I guess don't feel the need to check on you to see if you do actually need something.",

Out of all the buffets, we have to say that Harrah's was our favorite of the three. We were a bit hesitant to go because of the reviews but glad we went. The food was great, it didn't taste like it was sitting out all day. They had many options and tasted fresh. Loved the cris cut fries & the fried shrimp!! I was surprised that they gave out crackers in a packet rather than self serve. They had a good pizza selection and they had a pho station!! That's a plus for us! That was cool. We would definitely go back again!",

This was a nice surprise because I had actually come back to the table without crab because the portions offered on the floor were still frozen!  The meal began to turn south from there starting with ME having to bus our own table.  As we proceeded to get our main course, there wasn't anyone around to help us. The main course was marginal.  Macaroni and Cheese was too cheesy, whipped potatoes were watery, sushi was dry, and they were not able to keep up with having their main course of prime rib out for folks.  The chef brought us his Napolean fruit dessert which was very good.  Their cookies and cream and mint ice cream were good as well.  Not worth the price of a buffet to have the best part of your meal dessert and have to bus your tables all night long.",

Most of them were pretty expensive and by the time we walked all the way to Harrah's we were exhausted and extremely hungry, so we thought we'd give it try.  It turned out to be better than we had expected and more!  They even had freshly made cotton candy and gelato!  Prime rib and cocktail shrimp for breakfast!  I think their breakfast prices changes after 10am and luckily we got there before 10am.  They also have a omelet station.  I've never been here for dinner, but breakfast was awesome!",

Anyway, I pigged out on prime rib, roast chicken, cold shrimp, kielbasa..yum..this place is my doctor's nightmare.  Dessert station did not disappoint.  Again, I returned to my table with two plates in hand.  In one hand, a bowl of mango sorbet.  In the other hand, cheesecake and chocolate brownies.  That was sheer gluttony in motion!!  Hubby and I ate so much that we felt nauseous afterwards.  But would we go again?  Yes.  This place is a party for your tastebuds.",

    "text": "Yes yes yes.  Here they do it right! I have been here twice now and both times I have left very pleased with the service and the food. This buffet is located in the not so popular Harrahs hotel and casino that is close to the heart of the strip. Also this buffet is included on the all you can eat 24 hour buffet that Caesar's entertainment offers. So let the review begin.  The first time I had tried this buffet was easily the best service I have ever received at any food establishment. So good in fact that I had to hunt down a spot on Caesar's website to send them an email praising the server Freddy for his attentiveness, caring, and incredible interest in seeing that we were thoroughly satisfied with our experience. e came to us many times, since we had finished our dinner he brought us some coffee for our dessert. He inquired about our trip and where we were from, then told us about his life and how he ended up in Las Vegas. All of it very nice and non of it intrusive or bothersome. Freddy was top notch. Moving on.  The second time we went was for breakfast so I can compare it directly with the Garden Buffet we had the morning before. Right off the bat it was not nearly as crowded and cluttered. Seating is more traditional buffet, big room lots of tables. The buffet is a long straight wall with key foods strategically placed. You can tell they pay attention to detail. Popular items of food such as eggs and bacon were located at three different spots at the buffet. This keeps the clutter down and not having thirty people waiting in line for the one dish of bacon or whatever. Also they give you a full carafe of coffee,     how perfect is that. No one else does that, no flagging anyone down for more, no waiting for fifteen minutes with an empty cup.  They do have some great items like gelato, donuts, cinnamon rolls, monkey bread, and cotton candy, yes cotton candy you can take for later. The food here is slightly above average, it is good for the lower end buffet that this is, but what puts it over the top and gives it an extra star is their attention to detail and impeccable service. Clearly they pay attention to the people they hire. The food is good, the service is great, the attention to detail is on point, and the location and seating is ideal, what is not to like about this place. The only buffet that I have been to in Vegas that beats this is the higher end Wicked Spoon...review coming soon.",

I actually had things on this buffet that in other buffets I often overlook. Although it's not huge and lavish like some of the other buffets the flavors are nice everything tasted great! Even the dessert was good so many options and all good and ice cream on freshly made  waffle cones. I do recommend it for dinner the selection is a lot better.

There were no fish at all, no fruits either.  The only seafood they had was snow crab legs and child boiled shrimp, and some seafood salad.  Almost no vegetable salads.  They have very limited varieties over all.  The only thing that was good at this buffet was the grilled stuff.  My family liked their steak and pork.  But overall the buffet is not that good.  For a buffet quality like this,  it is definitely overpriced.    In addition, there is no restroom inside of the buffet restaurant.  The closest restrooms is in the casino, with a long walk.  I think it took me at least 4 minutes to walk to the restroom from the buffet.    Definitely Don't recommend it.",

My family and I had bought the wristbands for $60 to eat at the buffets in the participating hotels. After driving around to 3 different buffets that weren't open for that time being, we decided to go to Harrah's considering we've never been and wanted to try something new. It took them 20 minutes till someone came over to clean up the dishes we had finished on our table, and when someone FINALLY did come -she was picking things up with attitude, and when my mom went to give her a bowl that the lady missed as she turned to walk away she knocked the bowl out of my moms hands and the sauce that was still hot fell on my mom. We didn't make a big deal about it because it was an accident but the lady never once apologized she just watched and walked away, while there was still food on the floor that people had to jump over. The manager was rude, threatening to call security on us but we left not wanting to stay there anymore do the horrible service. One of the employees even calling my mom \"arrogant\". Once again horrible hospitality and the food wasn't even good had zero flavor which is ironic considering the name of the buffet. If I wanted to be a real pain, I'd call corporate on them.",

    "text": "As far as buffets in Vegas go, this one was decidedly middle-of-the-road. I was thinking it might be all kinds of awesome sauce since the line snaked out to a solid 20 min wait. Weird thing is they weren't even filled to capacity inside. I'm thinking this may be nothing more than a clever ploy to make people think there's greater demand than in reality.   Of course, I could also just be reading into things way too much.   A dinner for one adult is $25, which is a decent price if you're planning to seriously gorge yourself until your stomach hates you. The theme to this buffet is that all the major cultures are represented, so you can dine on Mexican, Chinese, Italian... whatever you want.   The hit of the night was the endless crab legs. I think they were billed as King Crab legs, but these must have come from a midget king because they were small and tiny, like T Rex arms. I still loaded my plate with enough to feed three people.   Everything else was of varying quality. The Italian fare had some passable sausage & peppers. The pastas were OK.   I grabbed some beef curry from the Chinese section, but the rest of their offerings made Panda Express look high end.   There was a dude cutting up prime rib who looked like he would rather drown himself in au jus than continue slicing meat for one minute longer. It's always fun to pick out the employees in Vegas whose faces spell out a lifetime of internal misery from dealing with jackass tourists.   They had bananas foster for dessert. Well, actually they have something like 30 different desserts, but one bite of that and I got instant tunnel vision. At least if I'm going to stuff my remaining pockets of space with food, it's a fruit. Sort of.   With so many to choose from, I don't see myself coming back to this buffet next time I'm in town. I only ate here because I was starving and it was literally the next place I walked into.",

For $59 a day you get all you can eat buffets for 24 hours. We can usually stretch it out and get 4 meals out of it so ends up being a great deal for us. Flavors is one of the  better buffets on the plan especially for breakfast. The buffet is well stocked and the food was fresh all the times we went. I really liked the waffles with chocolate sauce yummy and the crispy bacon :) The dinner selections are good and typical buffet fair. Saturday night is really good when they have the Brazilian selections. While the food here is good other buffets on the strip are better (although more expensive also).

The Brunch buffet was around $25.00 per person.   I don't eat any animal or dairy so I had to ask plenty of questions to the cooks behind the counter.  They were very helpful and if they didn't know the answer they would ask another cook.

The whole reason I wanted to go there was for the crab. They were old and dry and probably been sitting there a while...super dissapointing . Cravings is more expensive  but worth it if you want good quality fresh seafood.   Then someone in my party leaned back and closed her eyes.

Obviously not sleep and said excuse me. The server started telling us how it was policy and she was just dong her job.

Some things were bland whereas some others were too salty like the crab legs. They did have a good variety of food and, of course, the desserts. They have an ice cream bar, not from the machine, but actually someone scooping it for you! But the best part was, the cotton candy. To the man who walked by me as I grabbed all four colors of the cotton candy and mumbled \"they all taste the same\", well sir, they don't!   Anywho, this review was actually for the service. The service was amazing! I don't know if he'll ever see this but this review is for you, Adrian! He was the best server I've ever had at a buffet. He was so funny and entertaining. He was constantly asking if we needed anything. He definitely hooked us up with wine and some other goodies at the end of the night.",

It has attracted people like us who has been busy shopping the whole day and by the time we reach our hotel with our shopping loots, we are left with limited options for a dinner buffet.   The only pros I can think of is it closes late at 11pm whereas other places closes 9 or 10pm. But well that doesn't mean it's a good thing after all. The seafood (mussels, prawns and crab legs) doesn't look that fresh but I still did give it a chance and try it. Crab legs is sweet but very salty, taste that it has been soaked in salt water. Cold prawns does not look appetizing too, and worst the mussels...look like it's been taken out from the freezer and they just unfreeze it. I felt so disgusted by the mussels.  Cooked food is average, nothing fantastic. Desserts look cheap...mostly cupcakes. Cupcakes look home-baked and very child-like. Presentation of desserts is horrible. I'm a dessert lover and I didn't even want to try anytime that is how bad it is! Even the ice cream looks cheap!   Will definitely NOT come back again! Would rather pay more to have fresh seafood and more varieties of desserts elsewhere.",

A lot of the foods had been sitting a long time and they get dry and hard, especially the meats. They used to have a ton of gelato flavors but now they only have 6 ice creams to choose from. They have touchscreen Pepsi soda fountains. Only eat here if you are going to buy the $50 all you can eat 24 hour buffet pass. Definitely not worth the price on its own!",

Of the three I attended (also Spice Market at Planet Hollywood  and the Paris Le Village), this was least impressive. It still wasn't, like, bad, especially for the overall value. But given a choice I wouldn't prioritize Flavors.  That being said, they had a lot of shrimp, and the buffet includes (regular) beverages, which is a secret value here and at Spice Market. They had a pretty decent chicken tortilla soup and a chicken cordon bleu that wasn't bad. I also really liked their nacho cheese and chips, oddly! Some of the otber food offerings looked a little \"tired\" when I was there, and their salad bar was minimal compared to others. Overall, it was kind of Meh. With one exception:  The desserts!! They had ice cream, lots of sauce options, a mix of cupcakes, cookies, brownies, bars and...CANNOLI! They were fantastic! I may or may not have had 4 of them...the dessert section alone might have pushed my rating up to a 4, but everything else was just so average.",

It's not too expensive: $15 for breakfast, $20 for lunch, $25 for dinner (for Total Rewards members, they give you a $5 off coupon when you check in at your hotel) and the selection there is very diverse.  Happy to see they have more comfort foods like fried chicken and bbq unlike the Wynn.  It's pretty much a middle of the road buffet where the food is pretty average, but it gets the job done in satisfying your cravings.  It definitely satisfied my craving for fried chicken and waffles.  I give it 3.5 stars round up to 4.",

I kept going back to try other cuisines as each plate of food tasted worse.. basics like a sausage patty were inedible. Hey, I eat anything and everything. Even the desserts had a strange taste. I even tried tons of whipped cream and hot fudge to  kill it, Nothing worked. Asian section a joke....fried tofu was as hard as a rock....tried a cut of beef...after removing a quarter pound of fat, had a few decent bites...blintz was disgustingly poorly prepared and tasted worse...I've put in many years in the Vegas buffet world and never consumed anything so bad.  It looks sort of nice, but.....and service stinks...I was one of three tables and couldn't find anyone for more hot water....Pay the extra few bucks and head across to Caesar's...Same chain, but different world.....I remember the old 7/11 buffets...limited in scope but food was fresh and tasty....and the pit bosses would always toss us a few buffet passes, even if we were only playing for a few bucks....",

I'm a platinum total rewards member so the exclusive entrance and discount does help out in the long run as this buffet can be a bit pricey if you do dinner or the champagne brunch.  I haven't had one bad piece of food here, and I tend to go every time I venture to Vegas. The food selection is so wide, they have fresh seafood, salad-making materials with a plethora of toppings, an omelette station, carving station featuring ham, turkey, prime rib, sugar-free desserts, creme brulee, and numerous flavors of gelatos. And that's just to name a few.  Last time I went, I had an amazing older waitress that was telling me stories of when her dad took her to see 'Dracula' in the movie theater and Bela Lugosi showed up in costume and frightened the audience. I give the story five stars but the food is quite exceptional also :o)",

Peel and eat shrimp wtf, seriously are we in tijuana?  I will never respect a buffet that puts out peel and eat shrimp, its disrespectful to people.  Damnit I am an american I dont have time to peel my shrimp!  Peel and eat shrimp is like telling a chick u love her then sneaking away at 4 am and changing your number the day after, its just plain wrong.",

We were right by Harrah's, so against my better judgement, that's where we ended up.  Let's just say $22 a head was outragious for what was offered.  First, I was hungry.  Second, I wasn't expecting much, but thought I could eat just about everything.  Nothing looked appetizing to me, even through my beer goggles.  Everything looked old, the place was kind of depressing.  I wouldn't think anyone would really consider ending up here, but if for some reason you are - please think again.  There are better, cheaper buffets in town, I promise.",

The chocolate fountain was excellent and the things to dip in it were good.   Cotton Candy is also good.   But the other food was the reason for the terrible review.

I got this from their website but it's spot on, We were in vegas for a bachlor party last weekend and this place brought us back to life after long nights! i had brunch here twice!!! It was delicious maybe just good hangover food, But damn when are you not hung over in vegas?  The weird fake looking pizza that i normally wont even try at a buffet was pretty damn good! i had to check it out after my buddy's were talking about how great it was. The shrimp was pretty decent and the veggies were even kinda fresh.  My favorite plate i had was filled with biscuits and sausage gravy that didn't just fall apart when you stabbed them with your fork, And the gravy actully had peices of sausage in it not just flavored that way, Eggs that were so so i guess can't really mess up scrambled eggs, French toast that was just delicious and crab leggs stacked to the roof... I never thought i'd eat crab legs for breakfast much less occumpanied by french toast. Maybe i was really muffed up but it was deliscious. Throw in a bunch of free beer and champagne to wake you up, with a few crazy stories from the couple next to you and now thats how to start a day in vegas!   I would recommend it to anyone. Im sure there are better buffets in lv but i doubt theres anything near as good for the price, save your money for alcohal and clubs",

    "text": "Alright, there's not a whole lot to review about a buffet's service beyond it was clean, the bus ladies were right on top of getting that empty plate out from in front of you and the food is well organized and easy to find what you're in the mood for.   So let's talk about the food instead. Mmm Mm!   Round One: Started with a salad. Just about eveything you could think of wanting on a American-style buffet salad, kinda wished there were kidney beans but the Ranch dressing made up for it. Ranch the way restaurant Ranch is supposed to be. Creamy without being thick, flavorful and heavy on the dairy.  Round Two: Fried Raviolis - Not what I wanted them to be. The fried outside overwhelmed the stuffing and I could only eat two before I was bored. Hush Puppies - tasted like your mama's. Roasted Red Potatoes - crispy but soft to bite into, spiced nicely and not too salty. Steamed Veggies - tasted like the vegetables they are. Stuffed Shell in Seafood Sauce. The Stuffed Shell... OH MY GOD. So delicious! I wished I'd gotten just a solid plate of them!  Round Three: Two more Stuffed Shells. I told you they were good!! Stuffed with Ricotta, Egg and spices, topped with some kind of white sauce with just a hint of seafood, not some overpowering fishy taste, then fresh, chopped tomatoes on top. So yummy but soooo filling. What? No room for desert?  Ok, Round Four: A slightly painful Chocolate Covered Rice Krispie Treat. Only painful because I was so full!! There's a chocolate fountain at the end of the buffet and an assortment of snacks to dip in it. The chocolate is flavorful, not that bland, stale taste that sometimes happens to chocolate fountains.  Ok, the things I personally missed: Crab Legs - Everybody loved these. My girls at the end of the table split three plates worth. Shrimp Cocktails - Two of my party went back for Shrimp Cocktail seconds when I went back for my Stuffed Shells. Gourmet Desserts - There's a whole section of them with Pastry Chefs hanging about to answer questions and take personal orders.  Totally worth $23.",

Mexican food looked unpleasing. The staff was mostly fine. Some clearly didn't want to be there. There was one incident that made me upset.   A Spanish family walked in just in time before 10 pm, and seemed to have special treatment with the Latino staff. Their teenage daughter (tall, beautiful, and skinny) walks to the gelato place, and the server, being Latino, puts on a big smile and offers her samples and a cone.  I, being Asian and Mexican (but just by looking at me, I look Asian) go up and ask to try a sample, and he says, \"I don't have anything for that.\" My father picked up one of the spoons he used for the other girl and handed it to him to use. The server ROLLS HIS EYES and starts giving us attitude. We even had to ask for cones, for he picked up the bowl at first. I wanted to throw my ice cream at him.   I definitely do not intend on going back there. God bless the other kind, fair workers there.",

Dried food on the counters, food on the floor and unpleasant smells no matter which way I turned.  Left a few dollars on the table for the waitress and left.

The buffet has metal containers with lids that contain the dumplings.  Sometimes you have to pull on the lid pretty hard to get to the delicious dumplings.  When I yanked on the lid, my hand hit the heat lamp above and I burned my hand.  A little ice from my drink and it was all good.  But don't do what I did.  Just another safety tip from Holly C. Yes, I am clumsy.  Anyway, this was the 4th buffet in the UYE Buffet of Buffets circuit.  It's a nice buffet but lacks the nice view that the Lago and Paradise Garden Buffet have.  The pizza here was very good.  Thin crust, good flavor.  I could have lived without the cornmeal on the bottom of the pizza, but otherwise very nice pizza.  The dumplings were also very good, despite the hand burning incident.  They have hot sauce here for the dumplings, which I appreciate. I also enjoyed the gelato.  There is a VIP entrance off to the side for Diamond, Platinum, Seven Stars.  I also think you can buy a line pass here to get into the buffet faster if the line is long.  I don't think this buffet has an all-inclusive champagne option. At least it was not offered.  But it was one of the rare buffets where the servers offered us coffee afterward.  Usually you have to hunt down a server to get it.    All in all a good buffet.",

The selection of food is pretty wide, and the quality is consistently good. Their desserts, in particular, stand out; between the ice cream, cookies, gelato, cupcakes, etc, it's tough to go wrong. Plus, at $25 or so per person for dinner, it's pretty affordable (about half the price of Bacchanal, for example!).  You can do better if you're willing to pay more, but if you want a no-frills buffet that won't break the bank, Flavors does the trick.",

We were lucky and someone in our party was Diamond/Seven Star status, so we were able to call ahead and have the restaurant set up a table for 14 for us. We also had a special entrance and immediate seating, so I can't speak to the wait times (but there wasn't a long line when we went, and it was prime dinner time on Friday night).  This was a great buffet. All the food looked fresh and tasted great, and there were a ton of options. I skipped the salad, because the lettuce didn't look like anything special and really who goes to a buffet to eat salad? The prime rib was excellent, as were the steak quesadillas and roasted potatoes. I was also impressed with the cupcakes (what can I say, I'm a dessert girl). Baked goods can really easily be dry, even when you buy them at an actual bakery. The orange creamsicle cupcake was moist with delicious cream cheese frosting.   This isn't the cheapest buffet, nor is it the fanciest, but I thought it was a really solid choice. Reasonable prices, good quality, tons of selection.",

    "text": "They have to be kidding..........this buffet is definitely not worth the price. We went to an afternoon show at Harrah's and decided to eat at the buffet after the show. We walked right up to the cashier, but it still took him forever to take our payment. It was super quiet when we got there, which should have been our first clue. Honestly, the service was fine overall-- the waiter (whose job is really is to simply clear tables, since you get your own drinks) was just fine. It's the food that I thought was ridiculous. It was the worst assortment of food I've seen in quite some time for the price. If I am paying that much for lunch ($24), I expect something other than turkey and ham at the carving station. I expect some vegetables that aren't overcooked. I expect decent sushi. I expect ice cream that isn't grainy. It was the most mundane assortment of food-- we were shocked. We could have gone to Green Valley Ranch and spent less than half of what this cost ($10), and come away with a much better meal. Harrah's needs to take some lessons from other buffets. Theirs is definitely not worth the money. I doubt we will ever go back. We have so many other good buffets in this town that there's no need to spend this much on such ordinary food.",

    "text": "I've been to Flavors a few times for breakfast, and have been pleased each time. Plenty of variety, including all the regular breakfast food staples. Everything tastes fresh and they have an omelet station where you can order your very own special omelet just the way you like 'em.   I recently came for dinner with my husband for the first time. I didn't think the dinner buffet was at the same level as breakfast. Though the same amount of foods and cuisines were still available, not much appealed to me. Of the things I tried, most were just average. I didn't go back for seconds on anything. That was really okay with me because what they were lacking in regular food, they more than made up for in the dessert section, so I was able to fill up on tons of sweets. Flavors offers more desserts than some of the larger and more high end buffets, and they are still quality sugary goodness. Tons of ice cream and sherbet to choose from, cupcakes, pies, pastries, bread pudding, creme brulee... you name it, they've got it. They even have a cotton candy machine where you can grab your own little stick of spun sugar!  One thing I noticed when browsing both regular food items and desserts is that the labeling was off. Maybe it was just on this particular evening, because I don't remember this being an issue during breakfast in the past, but many foods were not labeled at all and several were mislabeled as the wrong item. Others must have noticed this as well because I overheard another man tell his wife \"Hey! That's not hot fudge sauce! That's apple pie!\" Ahhh... Smart man right there. Good eye; good eye.   I would be willing to give Flavors another shot for breakfast, but definitely not for lunch or dinner. As much as I love desserts, I want them to be an ending to my meal, not the majority of my meal.",

The only good thing about the buffet here is that they have waffle cones for the gelato as well as cotton candy.   Service here was not very good...waitress took awhile to get us refills as in we were about to leave, then it came out...of course I downed it because it was apple juice.

Additionally, it also made my husband and I sicker than dogs...coincidence, maybe, but probably not! I think I could have gotten a better meal at Shoneys!!  I chose this buffet because of the crab legs. When we were finally seated after a 45 minute wait (with open tables everywhere, I might add) and we got up to the buffet, the crab legs were COLD...who the h*&^ eats cold crab legs?!?!? And apparently if you want to have warm steamed crab legs you have to be a VIP or high roller of Harrah's. The manager on duty, Jermon, came to talk to me but offered us absolutely nothing in return other than a breakfast buffet the next day (which we were leaving that morning). I told him that and he said \"let me see what I can do\" and left the table and NEVER CAME BACK!!!  Very disappointed, especially since this was for my birthday. Big FAIL on your part Harrah's and I hope that others see this and don't come here!!! Don't waste your money, people...trust me!!",

Maybe it was unwise to start at Bacchanal--maybe anything would be a letdown after that--but I just found this buffet to be entirely forgettable.  I enjoyed the prime rib, but most of the dishes were served in troughs and looked as though they might have been sitting there for quite awhile.  Some of it looked quite unappetizing, and I really didn't sample many of the mains or sides.    The dessert was pretty good ... decent selection, and looked and tasted appealing.    I was particularly pleased with the service.  Everyone we encountered was quite friendly, and our server took great care of us.    If you've paid for the 24-hour pass and you're in the area, it might be worth it to stop in for a snack, but I didn't find enough at Flavors to justify paying for this particular buffet separately.",

Had it been pre cut/sliced (you know what i mean) i would've gave this place 2 stars.   don't waste your time and if you can't get this comped just save your money and go to Hometown Buffet (yuk) instead.

    "text": "Started off with chicken churriscaria which was pretty tender and juicy. With that as a starter, went the BBQ route by adding BBQ baked beans, mashed potatoes and mac-n-cheese and some smoked kielbasa sausage. Overall it was ok. Good but not mmmmmm!  Next, I had a few bites of my wife's clam chowder. I was surprised at the chunks and tenderness if the clams! Very pleased with this particular flavor of New England clam chowder which enticed me to try a seafood plate. As I approach the seafood area I changed my mind. Cocktail shrimp I have to peel?!? C'mon man! No thanks. The fried cod wasn't looking to appetizing either, so I moved on to another \"flavors\" section. Tried a variety plate including fried chicken, cause you can't mess up fried chicken. Tasted like KFC. Added some orange chicken wings and some \"crab\" rangoon. Well the \"crab\" rangoons were veggie. They tasted like egg rolls except they were shaped like rangoons. Not very tasty and misleading? C'mon man! The chicken wings were to crispy to eat. I managed to tear off a piece and chew it for 5 minutes until deciding it wasn't worth it. Ok so no more \"food\", onto desserts. My choices were: mini strawberry cheese cake which was VERY rich! I ate half of it. Boston Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Coconut Cream Pie cupcake, gone in one bite. Chocolate crunch bar, gone in two bites. Bread pudding was pretty good with vanilla sauce drizzled in top. Some type of apple streusel with a sweet sugary sauce also was tasty. The dessert certainly bumped it up a whole star. The service was 4 stars. Our waitress always made sure our drinks were full though. Even tried to get my wife to get another glass of wine! My first two beers were just a little cooler than room temp, they fixed that with the next two icy cold Coors Lights. Overall experience was subpar to average at best. Flavors might consider changing their name to Blands. I don't think I will come back to this buffet, especially without a Groupon, which was why my wife came in the first place.",

While they stayed, they gambled. Nowadays, most hotels offer a budget-priced buffet, which represents excellent value if you need a blow-out.   Flavors is a great place to satisfy any appetite and features continuous live cooking stations, freshly prepared seafood, all-you-can-eat crab legs and fresh cut Prime Rib, an array of delectable side dishes, traditional comfort foods and a variety of pastries prepared to perfection.   Flavors represents cuisines from around the world, including Churrasco (Brazilian BBQ), sumptuous pizzas and Italian casseroles prepared in a wood burning oven, fire-roasted rotisserie chicken, piping hot steamed crab legs and tasty Asian selections such as hand rolled-sushi, Maki Rolls and homemade wonton soup as well as traditional Southwestern dishes. Flavors is one of the most diverse buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. For dessert, Flavors features a gelato station with homemade sorbet, gelato and ice cream.   Breakfast $14.99,Brunch $20.99, Lunch $15.99, Dinner $21.99.   An ideal place to stoke up after enduring airline and airport food for the best part of 16 hours!",

    "text": "I came here for dinner my first night back in Vegas. It was a great way to start off my vacation! I am not a heavy eater and I am a vegetarian, but I still found plenty of choices. The ravioli was fantastic, as was the pizza. I think the pizza was probably the best buffet pizza I have ever had! The dessert was to die for. If you don't eat a lot of meat or entree foods like me, good. Save it for the huge dessert section. The mango sorbet! The canoli's! All of it was delicious. I would return here in a heartbeat, it's really worth it for the price.  The only thing that deducted my star was that the cashier was EXTREMELY rude to my aunt! She didn't want to give her a discount (we had a coupon that was valid, etc), and made a huge fuss about doing the extra work. She was really demanding and rude. The waitress that seated us was lively and fun, but then the one refilling our drinks was spacey. I don't like attentive waitresses - but I do like frequent refills because I chug water like crazy.   Anyway, I can look past the annoying staff for the yum food!",

One thing that really pissed us off was that we were 3rd or 4th in line, but they have this Express Line.  If you pay an additional $5 per person, you get to go into the Express Line ahead of everyone else.  It was quite infuriating to see people walk in and get seated ahead of you when you've been waiting 45 minutes to be seated.  Crab legs?  Yea, they have them.  In fact, that's why we went.  But, they were either under cooked or way overcooked and you could hardly get any meat out of them.  They were definitely not worth the wait or the price!  The best things were the spaghetti with alfredo sauce and the big selection of desserts.  The carved ham wasn't too bad either.  The prime rib was cold and extremely fatty.  I'm thankful that we had a buy one, get one free coupon because it was worth MAYBE $10 instead of the normal $19.99.  We won't be going back!  And, don't let the crab legs suck you in; they're not worth it!",

While it may not be the BEST buffet in town, this one will certainly do the job just fine, especially if you can use your comps for it.  Staff is rather friendly.

Some of the food stations was not even open.

Although the food was just \"okay\", this buffet deserves 5/5 stars solely thanks to Adrian and will ensure a 2nd visit.  Who doesn't love being helped by someone who is oober friendly, courteous, happy, and a super hard worker?? Adrian is all of the above and sooo much more!! Meeting him alone is more than enough of a reason to swing by Flavors The Buffet.   Located in Harrah's Casino, Flavors The Buffet is spacious, clean, and is a lot more affordable than other buffets offered on the strip. The breakfast buffet will cost you $19, lunch $23, brunch $26, and dinner $29+/per person. I highly recommend splurging a bit more for the AYCD [all you can drink].  Our party of 4 were bummed that we missed brunch mimosas by ten minutes the day before at another location and went on a hunt to find a good spot to overly indulge to make up for this.  With breakfast not being a meal we are overly excited for, we opted on just finding something affordable with an endless flow of alcohol...  The selection of food was good, the quality wasn't the greatest, but you get what you pay for.  We did accomplish our mission of freely indulging in drinks- our mimosa glasses never stayed empty for too long & my champagne flute stayed glued to my lips. Needless to say, I had the time of my life!!!!   **Thank you again Adrian for simply being you. Not only were you busting multiple tables on your own, you never once lost that smile on your face. YOU ABSOLUTELY ROCK MY SOCKS!! Hopefully I'll see you soon!**",

If you're Diamond or Seven Stars, this is the joint to be.  They will bend over backwards for you and make sure that your drinks are constantly filled and table cleared of discarded dishes.   Plus, you get to skip the dirty heathen line, so ain't that the pits!?!  The pits?  Is that a good thing?  If it isn't, I'm making it a good thing.  Make sure to tip!  They have all of the usual fixings and stations: prime rib, seafood, Italian, Mexican, Asian and dessert.  Can I talk to you about the dessert for a minute?  There are a few grab and go selections, and ten a few fancy ones behind the glass that you have to have help with.  Is it worth shouting over the counter in order to get said desserts?  You're darn tootin' it is!  Because behind that lovely glass sits the scooped to order ice cream and gelato.  The best flavor?  The coffee with chocolate covered coffee beans mixed in.  Hot damn!  This place is also reasonably priced, so I always make a point to check it out when I'm out in Vegas and need a buffet. Come on!  You need at least one buffet for every Vegas trip.  Flavor's at Harrah's is the pits!  There it is again.  I'm making it into a good thing!",

    "text": "Dropping in Flavors The Buffet is like visiting a favorite aunt's place. For my hubby and me, there's no other buffet we'd rather dine in. In fact, this has been our meal \"headquarters\" whenever we're in Vegas for trade conventions and conferences. During a span of 20+ years, we've witnessed changes in menus and prices, upgrades in decor, and shifts in staffing. Such happenings can be distressing, but we still come.   There are people who want an endless spread of food and drink selections. The more the merrier. Some want beautifully-appointed dining areas. The trendier the better. This is not Flavors. The Bacchanal at Caesars across Las Vegas Boulevard would be that place.   What draws us to dine here time and again? It's not all about the food. Nor is it about the latest color schemes or trendy upholstery. Then, what is it that holds our loyalty? Of course, we love that Flavors has our 3 basic requirements down pat: delicious food, efficient staff, and comfortable seating. Among these, the most important is staff. We've gotten to know some of them quite well.  Let's start with the entrance. We don't get the feeling of a cattle call like many other buffets on the strip. The cashiers are friendly and efficient. Notable are Carol and Cherrylyn, who can be cool and welcoming even on the hottest days in the city.  On to the hostesses. The one who makes us feel pampered the most is Olivia. Broad smiles and pleasantries as she leads us to our seats. It's like being welcomed to a friend's home.  Before I go any further, I want to apologize to individuals not mentioned. Please understand that my senior moments are quite real.  Rudy is our favorite server of all time. He remembers our preferences despite our infrequent visits. And that speed! Don't know how he can serve so many all at once.  Moving on to Chef Manny and Chef Johnny, an amazing duo who wow with occasional \"chef's choices\". Other Caesars Entertainment properties also have talented head chefs, but none more adorable than these two, I bet.   Tying all these together is the management team, We like James and Michelle the most. James is more familiar because Michelle often  is assigned to the Oyster Bar during our meal times. James comes by to check on diners periodically. We're impressed that he pitches in to help his team bus tables when there's a crowd. None of that \"I am the manager\" attitude. Nice!  By now you may be wondering: Is there anything we don't like about Flavors? Yes, there are two. First, the self-serve fountains. Spills from beverages make seniors like us feel unsafe. Second, not enough servers. Staff reduction may be necessary, but must we put up with used dishes piled on tables for extended periods?  In short, Flavors may not be perfect, but we love what it offers. It's truly a toss-up between 4-Stars and 5-Stars. I flipped a coin ... It came up 5-Stars!",

They did have a variety of stations but the food was like cafeteria food.  If you are just looking to fill up it does the job but nothing was satisfying.  Also ambiance is lacking, not a very classy joint - I guess it is Harrahs...",

Let's just say I'd rather eat my elementary cafeteria lunch over anything served here. Absolutely no one around the restaurant looked happy, neither staff nor customers. Pretty sure the dim lighting was to take away from be depressing reality of the fact that we were being robbed by spending our money here. I don't regret many things in life but I regret eating here. This review is to warn others, gamble elsewhere, not here.",

No one told us we were supposed to have reservations (we were comped) so we waited in a line in spite of less than 1/4 filled restaurant .  Believe me, it was well worth the wait ~ ribs done to perfection, prime rib as it should be, sea food of various types, too much variety to detail but if you come away displeased or hungry  _you're_ the problem .  The (apparently in house made) gelato/ice cream was superb, they have several flavors including _COFFEE_ ! .    If you can afford the $30 + price, treat yourself to this at least once .  Yes there was _one_ hostess who has a very bad attitude, she's not happy and needs a different job . everyone else was very nice and helpful .  -Nate",

It's located right near the exit of where the Mickey Ds/Panda Express/Chipotle is. It was breakfast time on the border of lunch when we arrived and it was about $19. I think they have a deal where you can get unlimited alcoholic drinks? The customer service from the cashier and our waitress was excellent.   On to the food, it was pretty decent. From the looks of it, I thought it was going to be bad but I enjoyed most of the food I ate.  The hash browns were nice and buttery, which I got thirds of. The other selections were small but I liked it better than Cravings at Mirage...I think anywhere is better than there. For $19, not worth it. Maybe $10?? I'd come back to try the dinner because it sounds like they have some good options. I guess for a cheap buffet like this unlike the one at Caesar's...can't complain too much!",

Not overcooked like Rio. -Nice sized snow crab legs, but ya gotta work to get em open as they aren't halved. -Shrimp Cocktail, gotta shell em but they were fresh. -Champagne included -Hot fudge sundae for dessert...amazing how many buffets in Vegas don't have simple hot fudge to go with their ice cream or \"gelato\". It's usually chocolate syrup...here the fudge is hot! -Kind and friendly staff -They have a guy coming around with some hot specialty items...like right to your table...haven't seen that before...had some hot chicken skewers and some coconut tapioca thing...wasn't bad.  The bad: Where are the correct food cards and how come they aren't placed in the right spot? The whole entire buffet had either no names to their dishes or incorrect names. Pancakes were Spanish rice, this whole other area with a pastry puff with \"something\" inside was a complete unknown and none of their desserts had any titles anywhere...is this the sugar free section? What is this? I hate sugar free, but who knows...and if you have a name card that says pancakes and it's 9pm, it means that no one bothered to make the food card change at all for the entirety of lunch and all the way to the end of dinner. Hash browns all day or is that ravioli?  Overall a 3.5 due to the groupon, but I just can't hand it a 4...however, for $16 I will come back.",

There were other issues as well, and for $30 plus tax, and no rewards card discount anymore, it was very overpriced.

I wasn't totally impressed by any of the entree items, but hubby loaded up on the seafood and sushi, so i think we got our money's worth at least.  The sushi (according to him) was pretty darn good, especially for a buffet. It seemed quite fresh still and tasted pretty good. I had a Philadelphia roll that was good. The crab legs seemed small, they had UNPEELED cocktail shrimp...which was not fun to watch my husband peel while I was eating, they also had crayfish, which grossed me out, but I'm sure some people would really enjoy.  The \"buttered carrots\" were in some sort of gross, honey butter sauce and weren't cooked all the way. But the mashed potatoes and cooked cauliflower were super yummy. Didn't try the taco bar or pasta station, the salad bar was a bit lacking.   The desserts were plentiful and some were really tasty and some were just blah. The highlights were the cotton candy and the gelato! The raspberry gelato was the perfect ending!  All in all, if I had paid $50 I would've been super unhappy, but it was a good value at half off, even though they cleared all of our table off completely before we got back with dessert. (They had to get us new drinks and napkins and silverware, which cost them a few bucks off their tip in the end.)",

Only problem I have is the waiter,  he seems to be all in it for the tips. And seems like he pays more attention to the white folks than the minorities. I had to ask for refills twice, when he passed by quite a lot and saw we had empty cups.  But when he saw he had tips at a table,  he jumped right on it. But he won't get a tip from me.

    "text": "this buffet is a good deal.  if you show your players card, you get about a $2 discount.   the weekend price all day is $19.99 with your players card.  if you check-in on foursquare (you need to show this at the players club desk), you get a $5 off coupon.  our buffets for two cost $32(tax included) for linner (we were there at 3pm).  funny how people in vegas eat at all hours.  when i go to buffets, it doesn't matter where i am...i'm all for the prime rib!!  i had three helpings of prime rib.  heheh.  crab legs were meaty and delicious.  huge pork ribs were flavorful too.  dessert bar had good variety, ice cream, cotton candy, etc.    other dishes i liked were the 3-bean salad, cornbread dressing(like a stuffing), mashed potatoes, meatball.  the sushi was americanized and a skip for me.  didn't try the shumai or pork bun in the hot steamed area.  i planned on trying the carnitas, beans, etc to make myself a soft taco but they didn't have tortillas at the time.  when i got around to it, there was no room left since i still had dessert left.  if you are looking for more seafood selection or massive options, this place would be 3 stars.  i had everything i needed.  i wasn't looking to pay more for variety i don't care for..  i even liked their system.  upon ordering, they ask what you would like as a beverage.  it is written on the receipt, so you don't have to wait for the server to take your drink orders.  service was friendly and prompt.    for $9.99, they have all you can drink beer/wine too.",

I suggest viewing all that is available, unless you know what you want. I wanted waffles and found small, thick heart shaped COLD waffles. The butter was in individual little containers and very cold, aka hard. I suggest placing the butter in the heart waffles and pour the hot syrup on top (they have a maple syrup and whiskey sauce). It did taste good. The scrambled eyes where warm and good. My friends had ham & cheese croissant that was cold, hard and not edible. The desserts looked yummy. My only complaint is the food being cold. I understand that Flavors has an all day pass. I found the other eateries in Harrah's higher in quality & good.",

We had bought the buffet of buffets pass and had already been to three other buffets on the strip and those three had set the bar pretty high.      First, when we walked up there was no line for cashier at all but maybe ten people waiting to be seated. We thought, \"great, finally won't have to wait in line for 30 minutes.\" Wrong. People just kept walking up one after the other that were diamond members so they skipped right past us. It just really made us feel low class getting passed over for at least 30 minutes.      The food was ehhh... okay. At best. Compared to Planet Hollywood and Paris it was about McDonalds quality. Not much selection and the desserts were behind a counter so you had to ask for each thing making us feel like we had to settle for just one or two items.     The service was AWFUL!! I overheard the hostess say to the server that she will have to stop seating because the two servers couldn't keep up at all. We didn't get our drinks for at least 15 minutes and then never got a refill. There was a bus person that got plates once the whole time we were there. When I say awful I mean hands down the worst service in all of vegas. I know it's a buffet but goodness, if someone called off, have a back up plan in place.     This is my only negative review during the whole trip. It was one very big disappointment.",

I didn't even try the stir fry it looked so bad. Bland BBQ.  Salad bar scary, small and boring, and dressings not labeled/arranged.  Taco bar but no taco shells or tortillas.  I HATE snow crab legs that have been shredded in half, so much harder to extract the meat (if you think its a benefit then you don't know how to eat snow crab).  Burnt cream looked to have have the torch waved over it for a second leaving a film of sugar-water on top. Ice cream and Carving station ok, swift attentive waiters. I remember the days, not long ago, when $5.99 (or less) on the strip would get you about the same quality.  Then Mirage came in with 'gourmet' buffet and marked the beginning of massive price increases with the rationale that they were laying out high quality stuff.  Now it seems they can just lay out so-so stuff and still get away with charging premium prices.",

This was supposed to be a \"holiday brunch\" but there was really nothing special about the variety of selections and the food I did try was consistently lousy. Even the rolls were hard as rocks. I wasted $10 on the all-you-can-drink add-on since our waitress NEVER came around and when she did, she brought me the wrong drinks!

My only complaint is that they didn't have chocolate milk, but it's a small complaint. When I asked for orange juice, I expected them to bring me a small glass. WRONG! They brought a huge glass, which is exactly what my hangover was needing. They had a decent selection of donuts, and their cinnamon rolls were excellent, as was this caramel custard. They only had a tiny bit of dim sum (shumai), and it was just okay. All in all, for around $14 I thought it was an excellent deal, especially considering how much many of the other places were charging.  I will definitely go again!",

As a result, its pretty cheap, has great food, and best of all there's NO LINE.  The desserts there are the bomb and they even have over a dozen flavors of gellato so make sure you save room.",

    "text": "We decided to meet up with some friends here when we first got into Vegas.  Luckily for us we got here a little before 4pm so were charged lunch prices.  You just end up staying for an hour or more and they start bringing out the dinner foods.  Unfortunately since it was around the holidays, prices were more expensive than they normally were.  Since we came between lunch and dinner there was no wait.  The selection of food here is pretty typical.  They have a meat station with prime rib, turkey, ham, and rotisserie chicken.  The sushi station is pretty miserable...just a few rolls that looked gross so I didn't even try it.  Their Italian section has some good pastas and lasagna.  The best were the meatballs...so yum!  They also have a chinese station with rice, chow mein, wontons, etc.  Surprisingly there was still breakfast selections as well with eggs, sausage, bacon, etc.  I don't bother touching salad at a buffet...gotta get your money's worth and only amateurs fill up on salad.  The best part is the shrimp cocktail...shrimp were a decent size.  They also brought out crab legs later for dinner but I was already kinda full by then.  Desserts are decent.  They have a gelato bar.  I tried the tiramisu flavor which was way too sweet but the mint chocolate flavor was much better.  The chocolate cake was also good but a little on the sweet side.  TIP:  Join their player's club and you can get $5 off the buffet",

We went at dinnertime and there was a long line, which I expected.     I was not really impressed with this buffet.  There seemed to be something seriously wrong with the seafood selections.  The stone crabs and crab legs were really hard to open and retrieve any meat from; so I gave up on them.  From the other reviews I read, it seems like the crab legs were hot.  The ones we tried to eat were on ice.  Also, the prime rib seemed super fatty.  They had a good selection of Southern food and I liked the burrito bar.  For dessert, the chocolate fountain with marshmallows and strawberries was a nice touch.    I think there are better buffets to be had in Las Vegas.",

Additionally, there was a $5 off coupon that they didn't prohibit the use of... so imagine, 20 people saving $5 each... that's some good stuff!   They were able to accomodate a party of 20+, in which they should received an award for in itself. Not many Vegas buffets have the ability to do that... :)   Anyway, among my favorites include: Bagel and Lox / Unlimited Shrimp (already peeled) / Prime Rib. They also had a chocolate fondue fountain with only the best Rice Crispie treats ever!!!",

So that was $25 for a slice of rubbery pizza. She could have gotten the hamburger sitting under a heat lamp in water but declined. I thought the various flavors of cotton candy would atone for the lack of good kid food. I told them they could even get two, but they weakly told me the cotton candy tasted like chemicals and declined to eat anything else. I thought seafood was okay. Nothing else looked all that great. Angel food cake had a rock-hard shell and was only soft in the middle. I loved the creme caramel dessert and when I went to get more, I was disgusted by the flies that were landing on the deserts in the display. When the worker asked if he could help me, I told him about the flies, but he impatiently asked me, \"What do you want?\" The flies won. He didn't even hand me the desert on a plate. I was about to ask for one if the fresh desserts on the tray he brought out but he just gave one to me in my hand before I even said anything like he just wanted me to go away. The other workers seemed okay. I guess this one hates his job and doesn't care if you know it. Two stars because the place wasn't that ghetto and I liked the creme caramel and the chocolate tart with fruit was good. Minus 3 because I won't be coming back with so many other good buffets around.",

The salad bar portion is iceberg lettuce, tomatoes, canned chopped olives, croutons, etc. No fancy toppings for it. OK selection of dressings.   Out of the main dishes there was a BBQ chicken that had really good BBQ sauce on it.   A chocolate mousse pie and gelato stick out from the dessert area.   Service was mediocre too on clearing the plates and refilling the drinks. The line to get in also moved very slow - probably not enough servers since there were a ton of open tables.   I happen to like the Carnival buffet in the Rio and Spice Market in Planet Hollywood much better (if you are sticking to Harrah's properties).",

I was so hungry and didn't feel like walking back to Mirage or Treasure Island, both of which have great food, excellent service, and reasonable prices. So in  a rush to get some food I settled for Flavors. Wow! What a mistake.   Upon walking up to the cashier to pay for my meal, all three cashier continued their conversation, looking at me, saying nothing to me, and talking for over 2 minutes. Finally I said \"can I pay here to eat in this buffet\" and they looked at me liked I had stolen their kid. Isn't the cashier at the buffet suppose to take your money. And from here it only gets worse.  The hostess seats me at table next to a 80 year old man that has no respect for the space around him, or himself. The piled plates, the newspapers scattered around his table, and the booth on both side of him covered in his thrown about newspapers. The hostess tells me to sit and leaves all the newspaper on my seat. I looked at her like she was crazy and she pushed the papers slightly for my butt to have a clear space.   From here... oh god, the food is disgusting. Fat and grizzle in the roast beef so bad you can't chew it. Old crusted over foods, and empty containers of food everywhere.   After I sit down and eat my food I finish my soda, I say to the waitress can you please get me a diet coke and water. She snaps back...\"this isn't my section, I am off.\" Now she is clearing tables, and is dressed like all the other servers, and she is the only one in my area. So I say..\"can you please find the person who is working I would like a diet coke and water.\" She says, \"let me see what I can do.\"  A trip to get a wilted salad and over 10 minutes later I still have no soda. So I ask to see the manager. This buffet was $28. I have no problem with paying $28 to get a decent meal and decent service. Flavors is far from decent anything. Stay away it's a dump.",

We went for Sunday brunch and the line was maybe 10-15 minutes long, not too bad.  It cost approx. $25 but we had a coupon for $5 off per person.  Good thing too, because the food here was definitely not worth $25.    At first glance the buffet seemed pretty decent.  It had a little bit of everything: traditional American breakfast foods (eggs, bacon, sausage, etc), Mexican (Spanish rice, tacos), Asian (sushi, dim sum, chow mein) and prime rib and fried chicken and salads and dessert items.  I loaded up my plate with just about everything and sat down to enjoy.  The first sign that this place sucked was that the scrambled eggs were God awful.  It didn't even taste like eggs.  It was like greasy yellow mush with a slight salty flavor.  C'mon how hard is it to screw up eggs?  All I could eat were a couple bites.  I moved on to the bacon and sausage and they were overcooked and really really really salty.  The prime rib had absolutely no taste to it, even with the very generous amount of au jus I put on it.  The Spanish rice was very undercooked and seemed like little pebbles.  The sushi was just plain disgusting, there were no other words to describe it.  I also couldn't find any soy sauce anywhere, no matter where I looked.  I had to ask a worker and he brought me one.  I don't understand why they didn't keep one next to the sushi area.  Finally, I just threw up my hands in despair and went to get a donut.  A plain, glazed donut.  I figured they probably weren't cooked on the premises so it had a better chance of being pretty decent.  Unfortunately, Flavors Buffet managed to mess up the donut too.  It was stale.    I totally understand why everyone bashes this place----they totally deserve it.  If not for the fact that the workers were very nice and friendly, they would get 1 star from me.",

The asian food looked sooo gross and old. I am sure it has been sitting there at least for a week or so. The only thing I really ate was the prime rib which they had to cook it more once they sliced off a piece b/c it was sooo rare. I also had a create your own omelet, that was ok. The dessert selection was lacking a bit compared to rio. Yay the rest of the food was really unappetizing. I would not recommend anyone coming here even with that $5 off.",

Two nights at $36/night w/free upgrade and free breakfast buffet for 2 per stay. So.. We decided to hit up the buffet before our road trip home.  Went to the buffet at 8:10am and no line/no wait. Food was fresh, good fruit, selection of breakfast sausages and bacon. Your typical breakfast food. Bakery section, Asian section w/some pork buns, Mexican section w/eggs n chorizo, tortillas, salsas.. And other sections I can't remember. The waitress was kind and attentive but then again there wasn't that many people there. All in all.. It was a typical breakfast buffet, there's only so much you can have that fits into the \"breakfast\" category but it was free with the room so hey, why not?",

In fact, I almost never go out of my way to find a buffet, but Flavors at the Harrah's in Las Vegas had moments of greatness and was generally good.   We stopped in on Saturday for the Champagne Brunch.  It was $25 per person, but comes with unlimited champagne, which shockingly was not offensive!  Crab Legs: I was fortunate to be the first to receive a new tray of crab legs. The crab legs were sweet and although they were steamed, still retained a lot of flavor and were very enjoyable.   Pizza: Shockingly the kitchen has a wood fired oven. They cook the pizza in this oven and it is very good. Three or four different types of pizza were available (I chose the vegetarian), but it was thin crust and I really can't complain.  Sushi: The sushi here was a challenge. They only serve rolls here and unfortunately the rice was hard, and the fish of inferior quality, stay away from the sushi.  BBQ Pork: Wow, they have some Brazilain style pork that was a little overcooked, but seasoned to perfection. Oh and the sausage was very, very tasty too.  Had I not filled up on crab legs, I would have been all over the pork and sausage.  Dessert: To me the dessert is the real strength here. Tons of different options. I chose to indulge in a waffle cone with gelatti. Awesome way to end the meal!  Overall I enjoyed our brunch at Flavors and I'm a little curious to see how the dinner is...",

Having been to Vegas on several occasion but never getting around to try the Buffets, I made it a goal to hit as many buffets as I can during the 3 day Yelp Spring Break in Vegas. Fortunately, Harrah's offers a 24 hour Buffet of Buffets where you can hit 6 buffets as many times as you want in a 24 hour period.  $54 dollars later and with our 24 hour Buffet pass in hand, we made our way to Flavors and honestly, not much to write home about. The food selection was limited. It's quite small. But with all this comes short lines and plentiful tables. We were here for 15 mins. , tried a few dishes and was off to the next buffet.   If you're going to hit one Buffet while in Vegas, I suggest you skip this one and try something else.",

    "text": "The last time I was at an all you can eat buffet I was 15 living with my parents in Central PA. Even at a young age I knew this food model was flawed.... I ate here because it is located in the hotel we are/were staying in. The place is clean and the selection is plentiful. I had the roast beef, prime rib, ham, and mashed potatoes and it was very good: it was cooked properly and it was juicy. My wife had the salad bar and there was a solid selection and everything was fresh and well maintained. I should have stopped, but I thought why not... The shrimp, crab legs, clams, and sushi were all very bad. The crab legs were soggy and lacked meat, while the shrimp was very basic. The sushi rolls were hard and dry and basically fell apart before they hit my lips. Food aside the worst part of the buffet model is some of the people... The types are as follows:  1. The over eaters - they take a lot and eat most of it. It's a bit troubling to see.  2. The shover - they can't wait in line and need to shove other people to get to the food. I'm confident these people think the food will run out.  3. The lurker -  They invade your personal while you are making a selection and then pounce once you move and proceed to gather food with the tenacity of an Olympic athlete.  4. The waster - they take a bunch of food and only take a few bites.  Finally there is the 5th and most egregious buffet goer: 5. The save it for later. Once done gorging on loads of food they take more to go. I watched a women put food in her purse!!!!   While there are other types of buffet goers I think we covered the basic. After my experience here I think I will stick with table service mostly because of the above offenders. Let me be clear here I'm not upset by these people and they have every right to pursue happiness I just don't need to bare witness.",

    "text": "Ok this is one of my favorite buffets in vegas. Here's the catch.  Lunch and Dinner are VASTLY different, and it really isn't just about the food.  We did the Buffet of Buffets (See details in my Le Village Review), and we had lunch and dinner here. Both times we added on the all you can drink for 10.00 (Includes beer, wine and champagne).   At lunch time we get sat down in Rudy's area (Ask for him if you can he is AMAZING). I would have my champagne glass in my hand and he would fill in on the way to my mouth it was almost a game to see if he could keep my glass full, and boy did I try to beat him. He had my friend at one point with 3 alcoholic drinks in front of her.   We never had to ask for a drink unless we wanted something different like wine instead of beer etc.   The food was amazing, they had wood fire chicken, prime rib and pork. It smelled like a camp fire it was amazing. They also had cotton candy. I have never seen that at a buffet but it was AWESOME.  We went about our day and came back for dinner. Sadly Rudy only works the lunch shift till 3pm.  The food was still good, sadly the cotton candy was gone for the evening. However, we started with a female drink waiter. She was abrupt and very inattentive. I assume it was because it was the end of her shift because after she brought our first drinks we never saw her again. We had to flag down a gentleman that was in the area and after that he server our drinks and was pretty decent but we had to flag him down repeatedly and he didn't come over to the table just to check on us. I can see where this Buffet has a low rating due to service, but the food and my experience at lunch was good enough for me to warrant 4 stars.",

I hate places that slice open their crab legs, takes the freshness out of the meat.  Anyway the fact that the crab legs were warm it gave the crab a great sweet flavor instead of the salty/fishy flavor u get from cold crabs at other buffets.  I shared 4 plates with the bf lol.  Damn that hot drawn butter - slurpp!  The prime rib was not bad. I mean not the juiciest, but was rare and fatty.  I ate 2 slices.  The pizza was decent.  They had linguini in clam sauce that was surprisingly really flavorful.    Those were the few things i ate and liked, not much for a buffet.  Their soups were nasty.  All of them.

I have had both the breakfast and seafood dinner at Flavors and both experiences were remotely the same good food but poor service.   I thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast selection which contained all the essential breakfast items and a few extras. At $16 dollars a person the price was comparable to any other breakfast buffet or a plate at your average eatery.   Honestly, the problem was with our server who was rude, inattentive, and down right nasty. She totally ignored my table. She went around our area refilling just about everyone's glasses and checking on everyone but, my table. She would look in our direction then walk away.   Again no problem with the food so I ventured back last Friday evening for dinner. I loved it! Succulent crab legs and cotton candy are defiently a win. However, a larger selection would have been nice. I also noticed the absence of fresh fruit besides bananas and honeydew melon.   As before the problem was with the service. My server I believe her name was Jennifer was amazing. The problem this time was with our hostess who seated directly in the middle of the dinning room surrounding plenty of foot traffic. When I inquired about a different table she told me this was she could do and walked away even though half the dinning room was empty.",

    "text": "I love this Vegas buffet. I know the manager so that probably helps.  I'll save you the typical review focus points and get to what I love most; endless crab legs!  And it got me to thinking.  I wonder what I was in a former life.  It had to be something that loved crab legs.  But what could that be?  What eats crab?  Most crabs have many natural enemies, or predators. Birds attack smaller crabs, sometimes carrying them high into the air and then dropping them on boulders to crack their shells.  Fish with powerful, shell-crunching jaws also eat crabs.  Many kinds of mammals, from seals to raccoons, also look forward to a crab dinner.  Crabs have many predators in the ocean. If not a larger species, sometimes crabs even prey on their own. With pinchers and hard shells, it is hard to imagine what finds crabs so worth all the stress. However, perhaps ocean creatures know, like land lovers, what the taste of crab meat is like, even without garlic butter sauce.  Maybe I was an octopus. The jaws of an octopus are known as the beak. These are very sharp, and the bite of an octopus may inject poison. First, the octopus catches the crab by landing on top of it, then uses the suction discs to capture it and finally bite into its hard shell. For crabs, the bite is fatal, paralyzing the crab so that it no longer uses its pinchers to thrash, allowing the octopus a tasty crab leg dinner.  I'm not about to inject an poison or get into a death dance with my dinner.  Maybe I was some other kind of fish or sea creature. Dog fish, sharks, striped bass, jellyfish, red drum, black drum, cobia, American eels and other fish also enjoy crabs. As larvae and juveniles, crabs are especially vulnerable to attack by smaller fish, sea rays and eels. As they grow older, turtles like to munch on crabs, as their jaws are powerful and able to crunch through the tough shell.  I'm not crunching through any shell with my jaws or picking on the little kids.  Maybe I was a sea otter or seal. In addition to crayfish, fish and frogs, sea otters love a crab meal. In fact, cape clawless and Asian small-clawed otters feed mostly on crabs. Sea otters eat about 25 to 30 percent of their body weight, so otters go through a lot of crab in one day. Seals also like to feast on crustaceans such as crabs. In fact, the crabeater seal from Antarctica is named for its love of crab. However, mostly these seals like krill. Another variety of seal that loves crabs is the Weddell seal, another mammal of the Antarctic  Ocean.  25 to 35 percent of my bodyweight in crab meat!  Now we're getting somewhere!  Maybe I was an ordinary everyday hardworking crab. Adult blue crabs are especially known for their cannibalistic nature when it comes to eating their friends and family. Smaller or weaker blue crabs with issues such as missing limbs, bad health, parasites or other disabilities are the first to go in the blue crab's chain of command. Younger species of crabs are especially vulnerable to older, larger crabs who have no preference for what they eat while scavenging the bottom of the ocean.  No, that's not appealing at all.  There you have it ladies and gentlemen: Flavors, The Buffet - favorite of sea otters and seals the world over!",

Virgin bloody Mary's, fruits, a carving station, ethnic style breakfast items like congee and Kim Chee.  Coffee was served by the carafe and was pretty good.  Service was swift as well. It cost about $20 per person but there was no way I could try all the delicious items.",

    "text": "If you have kids and want a place where they have a variety of different foods, this may be the place for you. Price wise it is the least expensive buffet we could find in Vegas. The staff were very friendly. The place is clean, and the food is fresh. But remember you will get what you pay for. So although the food is fresh the flavors are lacking. Awkward for a place literally called Flavors. As an example the Prime Rib Roast looked amazing. A beautiful medium rare red color and some nice ribbons of fat running through the meat. But when I tasted it it was pretty much tasteless. Same with The Sushi. It was fresh, but the quality of the fish was of the lowest grade and therefore tasteless. But my 13 year old grandson just loved it. Lots of seafood to choose from, but once again although fresh and looked great, flavors just wasn't there. If I'm with my grandson I'd come back. But if it's just me and my wife I'll pay more at one of the better buffets where I know the food will do more than fill my belly. Oh and I'd just like to mention that the bathroom is a long hike from the buffet. I had to ask 3 people for directions along the way. Not the buffet's fault, but if you have kids be prepared for some long walks.",

Poor quality food, bad service, bad atmosphere, everything is just awful.  We came here with the BoB pass so we didn't even pay anything extra but if I had I'd have been livid. The carving station ran out of meat 5 minutes after we arrived and started cooking it then so there were 10 of us waiting and waiting. Food was bland, bad quality and all tasted like it came from a cheap packet. Soups were dotted all over the place and ranged from cold and stodgy to just pure liquid.  I don't understand how everything was so bland. The staff are the weirdest group of misfits I've ever seen and not a single one was polite. Please don't spend money on this place. Try another buffet or go somewhere good or you'll feel as cheated as I do right now.",

Environment was spacious. Staff at the register and seating were friendly and funny. The waiter was helpful and most of the time prompt. I didn't interact too much with the cooks but they seemed to have fun in the kitchen.   There is a ton if categories to choose from fresh salads and fruits, seafood, American, Italian, Asian, Indian, Mexican and of course dessert! Quality of food was good! Although there were a few items that didn't turn out so great, but I could have just picked it at an off time! I was extremely satisfied and definitely feel I got my money's worth!   I would recommend doing Flavors buffet, especially in the 24 hour buffet pass! It's a great deal and necessary fuel for all the Vegas festivities. I would come back, but I would also like to try the other buffets that are part of the package.",

They had posole (my friend said it was really good), tortilla soup, chorizo and eggs, rice and beans. I must say that the tortillas were a bit hard. In the Asian area I seen sushi. In the American area, they had the regular breakfast staples plus breakfast pizza and chicken and waffles. Their carving station included ham, sausage and meat. They had a seafood area with crab legs, shrimp (tasted weird) and mussels over ice and clam chowder, which was really good. There was a salad bar and fruit,which was next to the dessert.  I didn't see the salad bar until I headed for the dessert. They offered gelato which looked good but I was too full to try.  The service lagged. I had to track her down to get the Sierra Mist we asked for before we ate our food.    It was a good deal for the price. Some of the food tasted well but the service did pull down my rating.",

Right up front it's over priced, and getting in is a awkward wait to pay, then pay to wait, scenario that makes sense few places other than concerts and theme parks, apparently there is some way to get discounted meals, and a \"fast pass\" (the people in front of me did) here but when I asked the lady at the register about it, she denied that being a possibility. But hey we're on the strip so it's not exactly like we're here to penny pinch.  The food is really were I fault this place, there's a lot of it, but most of it was lack luster or unpalatable. The sweets counter was great if that's your thing, but moving on, many of the dishes where little more than the untended remains of a feast gone by.   Several dishes had the classic trope of a bad buffet in that they simply added more food when it ran low and left the rest behind, the bacon was a perfect example of this, completely full with noting but the crumbs no one really wants to eat. The fresh cut ham was a highlight, but that's not to say the on demand dishes where completely spared from the monotony, the fry station must have used sub par greasing or cookware leaving it with a tinny taste.  All and all it's a less than average buffet, that left me feeling sick and ripped off. But if you come to it for what it is, and plan on eating there enough to invest in what ever it takes to get in quick (seriously what kind of 5 star joint are they pretending to be? Lol) I could see a person having a pleasant experience.",

Skip this casino buffet and go find an all you can eat Korean BBQ buffet and you'll have food 5x better for a lower price.  You were warned.

Sounds nice, but the purpose was clearly to convert what used to be servers into nothing more than bus persons.   They cut the deserts section in half to provide room for a makeshift salad bar.  Truly the most pathetic excuse for a salad bar EVER!  There is no offering of potato salad or other common staples.   I was 3/4 the way through my second plate and there had yet to be anyone stop by my table despite my $5 tip at the cashier stand upon entering.  Straws are only available from the floor worker, so I finally flagged one down.    The food was frankly lousy.  The once decent breaded shrimp has been replaced with a processed, low quality popcorn shrimp.  The shrimp sauce has no flavor whatsoever.    Unless you like sesame seed balls or smashed Heat and serve French toast, your going to have a hard time finding anything worth eating here.   We finished our desert 15 min ago and our dinner plates are still piled here on the table.  I would definitely not recommend tipping more than $1 per person in advance at the cashier stand.  There are no servers any longer - only bussers.    F- Caesar's Entertainment.... F-",

    "text": "Hard pass, for almost $40 a person, the food court at Harrahs is a better value and food tastes better. Advertised as crab legs which are served cold to save money per the cook, when I mentioned not being happy, Ben the manager said we are trying to game the system as we had been sitting there for about. 20 minutes. I'd steer clear. Seriously  Update  So, upon the management at front desk learning of how we were treated at the buffet they applied a $20 food credit, however we were checking out, so while that didn't help having donated $75 to a buffet we didn't really eat at, it was worth mentioning.   In closing, neither myself or the cook (believe or not he stated not ever eating the food here) can recommend eating there.   Totally blown away at how I was treated there, I'm guessing the deal with a lot of crummy people but that doesn't mean they should treat their customers in the manner they did.",

Breakfast was so yummy and so many yummy options  can't wait to go back when I come back to visit ! My whole family ended up loving it too, and we all already decided where we're coming back when we return for breakfast/lunch! Haven't tried their dinner but I'm sure it'll be yummy too!",

The rate was higher than we expected due to the holiday but there was no signs posted at the front desk or the website saying this. I only asked once and she made me feel like I was dumb. I would like to add it was not just at this point so I wasn't holding up any lines. So I was already a little disappointed by that experience. Then we started eating. It was all so mediocre. Even the basic Mac n cheese and stuffing were bland and soggy. Everything needed salt and pepper. There was a large ish selection but nothing I wanted seconds of.  I would not come back here over other buffets we tried. Hopefully they make some service and quality changes.",

I then stood in line which was rather moving kinda slow but I patiently waited my turn at the cashiers. Once I made it to the cashier Ms Carol L ; Great Personailty ; I was immediately welcomed and then seated by Hostess.  When I tell you that the food selection was great and tasty I am not exaggerating. So many great choices.

Positives Found Groupon and the meal was of value server and everyone there friendly and accommodating  No wait  Sparking wine and mimosas were plenty  Food quality on some items was goo   Cons Desserts were not good Not a lot of selection, which can be good since they focus on providing better quality food with small selection.",

You not only get the best deal but you have VIP access. We didn't have to line up to go in. We went through the fast line, the one for premium clients, showed our Groupon and whalaa. Yes, I have to be honest. The customer service was terrible. From the host to the waitress. The interior is kinda old but it was clean. About the food......a little bit of everything. Your best choices are the crab legs and steaks. That was pretty decent. For the price, not bad. Going back? Maybe not.",

I came for a late lunch, but they started putting out things like the crab and the carving station for dinner, so I was able to enjoy that.  There wasn't a massive amount of variety like other places, but it's priced $25-30, so of course not. I think it had a good variety including seafood options. They had gelatto at the dessert area, which tasted great and there were like 6 flavors, so it was nice to try a few.  It's not the kind of buffet I would come across town for, but if you are staying in Harrah's or a hotel next door, it's a good meal for a comparatively reasonable price. There was no line when I came at like 4 pm but there was a line when I left (probably because it's a cheaper dinner option than other places) so if you do come, come on off-hours or be okay waiting a bit.",

I come back n shift has been changed. I talk to Lesley and she was polite n called for manager. With out talking to me or hearing story out he denies my request to upgrade from one time buffet to 24 hours for $25 more. I told him hold it up n gave him story above. He starts shaking his head like I'm a hardship n not a customer. I ask him y r u shaking your head like I'm a problem. He agrees to do it no sorry nothing. If first his cashier would have offered it NP 2nd thing if that cashier tells new cashier what happening np 3rd thing if manager comes out hears whole story doesn't start assuming anything doesn't make customer feel like a criminal doesn't make customer look like a a$$ NP  First thing in management listen and don't blame who's right who's wrong just figure out how everyone can win everyone haves a great day. Make customer feel wanted need show them your value and show them their valuable too u and company. No customer no funding no business basics in in any business. With management like this no one survive. Either retrain or get rid of him. Could have been a bad day for him too .  Great selection of food deserts Definitely the food is worth the price. Clean place family friendly. If you what a good bargain for family $50 24 hour period unlimited eating desert drinks this is the place . Below is the other places included",

But if you're looking for a good selection of your expected foods, then Flavors can hit just the right spot. I've been here for both breakfast and dinner and both meals have been fine. Nothing to wow me but also nothing that turned me away. I do definitely find myself gravitating back towards the same areas here since I early on find what is good on that visit and stick to it.   One thing I would say though: if you come here for breakfast, stay away from the orange juice from the dispenser. It's always just water with orange coloring. I doubt there is any juice in there.   Wait staff is always very friendly and attentive. They are definitely the best aspect of the meal experience here. That's for sure. Props to them.",

Their six to seven types of gelato/sorbet saved this place from getting the ever rotting one star rating. Also their Brazilian Pork was pretty good. But I only fancied two items in the whole buffet, that's not a very nice percentage.   The sushi's rice was so hard that when I bit into it, the rice crumbled into many individual pieces. The canoli was not fully filled, they stealthily stuffed both ends with cream but left the middle with nothing! Just because I can get as many canolis as I want does not mean that I don't deserve a decent dessert. The pork bao barely had any meat in it, it was kept plump by injecting loads of orange sauce to it.   The food was so plain. There was nothing special to it. They didn't even have cut up fruits such as cantaloupes, watermelons, honeydew, or the such. All they had were green apples, red apples, and bananas. Come on, it's a Vegas buffet! These are the most simple fruits in the world. Even hometown buffet has a better selection. I do feel bad expecting such amazing things out of these buffets but come on, they are the renowned Vegas buffets and they definitely cost more than normal ones, so why not have high expectations?",

It wasn't the best food choices but I loved the champagne and how attentive the waitress was. my bf and I both had champagne and I had a big beer which was tasty and made me more drunk than a skunk! We had gotten a two for one special because we had a couple's special so that was hella dope. The desserts were amazing. I'm a big buffet person tho and I love variety. I also loved the pictures that we took outside of the buffet. It was the kind that you stick your face in and the body isn't yours. I was drunk and fell on the floor from laughing so hard. My bf was kinda pissed that I did that but I think he was just mad that he wasn't as drunk as I was haha..  Oh yea, I will be back :)",

We've visited the one in Harrah's AC so we were expecting the same long sprawl of fresh, foods on themed stations just like the one we'd been to...Lets say we were highly disappointed. Its small, most foods are low quality, ill prepared (overcooked) and bland or really salty (the small salty pathetic crawfish). Luckily for us we had a Groupon, and it included alcoholic beverages, I would've been really pissed if we were charged the full price. Endless mimosas, champagne and wine helped me make it through without wining and pouting horribly.  I wanna give 1 1/2 stars but that's not possible so its a 2.

We were definitely surprised to find stone crab, snow crab legs, and mussels on a weekday for sure!  My favorite was their chocolate fountain with huge strawberries.  Overall, it's a very simple and basic buffet for a strip casino.  We definitely wouldn't be here if we were paying full price though!",

Where to begin...We thought we had struck it rich when we arrived and there was no line and absolutely no wait. Now I know why! The food was the worst I have eaten any where on the strip. The crab legs used to be served steamed and hot, now they are on ice. The price for the buffet has jumped by ten dollars per person. I paid $122.00 for four of us. The service was sub standard at best as we had to ask for plates to be removed and drinks to be filled. I will give the waiter this the plates were going back with lots of food on them that just could not be choked down, so that added to his work load. I give this buffet a 1 star just because I can't give a zero. Shame on you Harrahs for this slop!",

Sometime we went without drink refills. But all-in-all not to bad.  Two things that always stand out for me are: The Ice Cream. It is always great, just give me more in a bowl please. Second is that they serve Cotton Candy. Almost no one serves cotton candy. That to me is very innovative.  The only thing I think is completely wrong is the price. It is not to bad at $23.95. I just do think it should be a few dollars less without having to show your Harrah's club card.",

Well, if I had yelped it before I would have given it a \"5\" and in my would-be update, I would give it another \"5.\"  The Harrah's buffet has consistently been one of my favorite buffets in Las Vegas.  Not only is there a large selection of food you can get but the quality of the food is extremely high.  I absolutely love the seafood here, the steak, the Asian food, and most of all the ice cream!  I've been going to the Harrah's buffet since I was 10 years old and in the past couple decades it has been consistently amazing!  My family and I stumbled upon it randomly and since then, I try to eat here every time I go to Vegas.  I've had many other buffets - at Rio, Treasure Island, Bellagio, etc., but Harrah's is really the only buffet that does NOT disappoint EVER!  The food is so fresh... the crab legs are already cracked for you, the fish is never dry, the guacamole is fresh, the steaks are succulent.  It's just perfect.  The dessert selection is also very large, which I love about this place. You really cannot go wrong with Harrah's buffet! I don't like the Harrah's hotel very much and have only just passed through there to get to other places or gone there for just the buffet or the Toby Keith's bar upstairs and never actually stayed there, but the buffet at Harrah's is SUPERB!",

My nieces preferred the pretzel rolls they said that they were really good. The garden salad was simple and delicious. I'm not a huge steak person, but I did have the steak that was made and it was cooked perfectly very moist and very tasty. The desserts are plentiful. They had creampuffs, eclairs, a custard that looks like creme brulee, Tiramisu, gelato - and the gelato was yummy! Every thing was definitely delicious!!!",

He eventually brought us two plates of half frozen snow crabs. I didn't receive a refund from neither Groupon nor Harrah's. This was extremely disappointing to me.

They told us that the only that we could not use the pass at Ceasars Palace,  but all others in the Ceasars group was fair game.   So we ate our brunch,  and the intent was to come back to another location for a early dinner,  before hitting the strip for the night only to find that the ones we found were all closed until 5pm.   So we went our on strip without dinner and were going to come back around later on the evening only to find once again,  some closed at 8pm,  and by the time we got to another one they had already closed.   So we didn't have dinner at all.  So much for getting value for our 160 bucks.    Woke up the next morning,  barely made it up to Paris location for their brunch before our 24hrs expired.   So all we got was 2 brunches each for 160 bucks.    It's not 24hrs, like they bill it out... More like 10 to 12hrs if you manage to find one open.    RIP OFF RIP OFF RIP OFF  I decided to write a letter to their corporate office.  While they did reply in about 48hrs.  All they offered was 2 additional meals on my next visit.  I replied and said I would be happy if they offered 2 meals per person,  that way I felt like I would be getting full value for my 160 bucks.   They refused.  So much more treating a Platinum Total Reward Member Good...   Highly not recommended to get the pass... Especially on a weekend when they jack up the prices 50 plus percent.",

I wasn't able to finish my dessert of flan, cream puff, and chocolate cupcake. Neither option had real distinguishable flavor.   The staff was friendly and the service was good.",

I was clicking the screen 30 times and was all messy and sticky with soda. So I was like ok, let me try the other machine. Same thing. Not only was I mad at this point, but pissed everyone off around me and had to hurry and get Pepsi. Atleast the guy behind me agreed and I said \"Im complaining about this on yelp.\" I wasted a solid 3 minutes getting a drink and was a clear waste of resources. Another complaint was the plates were scalding hot and I almost dropped the damn plate which wouldve made me flip. Food was pretty good though.",

Most of it looks like it's been sitting out for quite some time. First off the salad bar is in a weird spot, it's on the opposite side of the dessert. I didn't realize this until after we ate. The options are limited, and the options are odd. There isn't a lot of normal buffet foods, and I'm from the Midwest where we know our buffets. We are all around 30 lbs over weight at all times due to them so trust me when I say do not eat here. I know it's listed on the buffet of buffets option but it's not worth it. The sushi is not fresh, the Mexican and Chinese options are limited and sub par at best. The smoked sausage, turkey, and pork are okay but dry. The drink selection is what it is. And the desserts are stale. The only plus is the staff is super friendly.",

Yer boy ain't really bout that buffet life, I know mah gut might make you believe otherwise, but on real I take flavor over all you can eat any day.   Aight now that I got that disclaimer mess out the way, I'm tell you what I did and didn't like. I went for the brunch on Sunday and some of the breakfast food was on point. The corn beef hash and country gravy didn't give yer boy nothing to complain about. But some of the other stuff was too dry, them biscuits and waffles left me wanting, didn't matter how much syrup or gravy I put on them.   My recommendation is if you in Vegas and finna grab a cheaper buffet you could do worse, but if you down to spend a bit extra, they got bomb restaurants everywhere in Vegas.",

This buffet has a variety of types of food stations from seafood to pasta to American grill sort of stuff, etc. But seriously, everything was mediocre at best. The ONLY things I actually enjoyed were the crab stuffed tilapia, the quesadilla, and the little cheesecake cup. The rest of the food I picked at, and I tried nearly everything.   Now I probably would've given them a 3 star rating as befits mediocrity, but added to the lame food was the fact that we waited in line for an hour despite the fact that we could see that an entire side of the restaurant was empty. Perhaps that was a staffing issue, but it still seems like bull.   If I ever come back to Vegas again, I can guarantee that I will not waste my time or money here.",

We came here on Christmas but our Travelzoo voucher didn't work (on weekends too).   The food was decent. The sushi wasn't good, but I liked the variety of other things, like the Southern food. I enjoyed the shrimp cocktail and white wine clams. The best part though? DESSERT. The ice creams were so pretty, and unlimited cotton candy?! You've got to be kidding me. The guy working there (we came back to look for his name tag but he didn't have one :() was really nice too.  Also, we had an AWESOME server, Rudy (extra star for him). He checked up on us pretty often and was super friendly. He brought us a lot of drinks and we didn't manage to finish it all. There was even hot tea with honey. ^_^   Overall, not the best buffet in Vegas but decent, especially if you love desserts lol. Might come back again???",

It just needs to be switched out more and not sit under the warmer for so long. On a good note the Chinese food was good and the sesame balls were fantastic. The bread pudding was good but was almost completely gone and I would have had more but couldn't scrape enough off the bottom. The ice cream was delicious. Seafood was pretty good. All in all just moving the food around and restocking the items that move out fast would make it better but at this time I don't think it was really worth the money.",

The lo-mein was sitting out and got hard - it opened around 3pm I believe and I arrived around 4pm! How does that happen?  The crab legs tasted like salt water. Yes they were cold crab legs but they weren't anything special. Comparing to the warm crab legs at the Mirage, they don't even!  The only good thing was the cookies and cream ice cream but I could've gotten that anywhere else for under $10! I wish I picked a different buffet or restaurant; I was basically out $40.",

No.  Is it a \"budget friendly\" option? Well, it's cheap.  I was comp't but would not have been $34.99 for dinner. Not worth it.   Let's go with basic buffet rules (as we should all know), MEAT only! Crab claws: Ick! Soft, mushy and...just no.  Prime rib: filling but nothing \"prime\" about this. Tried a few cuts on a few roasts. Not what I want my prime rib to taste like. Even the salty ends were meh.   There was some other meats like fajita chicken and Italian meatballs that were equally edible but not worth returning to.   The sushi was HEAVILY riced but the seaweed salad was a nice shot.   I don't know what you're looking for.  If it's a cheap meal, sure. You could do worse. I guess.  You could do allot better though from a buffet in Las Vegas.",

While they had posted $31.99 for adult dinner and $21.99 for children, we were a party of 9 adults and 1 child and for a  Friday dinner (06/28/2019) I was charged $380. After reviewing the bill in my room I realized they had overcharged me by $46.00. After calling them and a long wait they explained that they charge %15 extra for parties of 8 or more while nothing was posted on their signs in restaurant in this regard. Usually they should honor you with discounts when you have a large party!!! A total reap off. I will never go there again. Be careful people",

    "text": "We had 2 complimentary buffets through Caesars Rewards program.   After reviewing Yelp reviews of other buffets to decide which one to go to, a very close friend recommended Flavors.    Our Platinum tier status allowed the opportunity to enter a special line which was nice.   We were shown to a booth  which displayed a \"Platinum\" sign.   I don't know what purpose that served.   The person who served beverages and removed plates and such came to our table twice so refilled beverage once and removed plates once!   She was not visible to call or flag down.   In fact, very minimal dining area staff seen.     Food offerings were of good variety .., Asian, Italian, American and Cajun ... Clam chowder, Cioppino warm but ok.  Crab legs & cocktail shrimp very good.   Fried chicken breast dry under warmer, Mac & cheese & mashed potato were good.   The prime rib w/ au jus was very good.  Could possibly return for another try .... overall the 3 stars were for the food.   Dining area service would be 0-1 star.",

I love me some tasty crawfish, delicious crab and claws and if i'm really lucky a tender piece of juicy, flavorful prime rib.    Chef Manny, Chef Robert and a huge thanks to Chef John for a fantastic meal every time I swing in. This place was really hopping and we got there early to avoid a huge crowd that entailed after we left.   Everything was spot on and always enjoy the tasty food here at Flavors Buffet.  I have my favorites for sure and usually pile on for just those, but a. ice bowl of ice cream at the end ways seems to hit the spot with some hot fudge and delicious sprinkles and oreo cookie pieces on top.   Keep on trucking Chef's and looking forward to my next return to the Flavors Buffet.",

Enjoyed the diamond perks of one free alcohol drink and served drinks.  Flavors hits your Las Vegas staples from Mexican to Asian.

First time experience at this buffet was very good & I can't understand some of the negative reviews here about the food.  Food: Snow Crab legs offered both hot & cold & they were much larger than the Rio sister property which touts Rio buffet. Delicious crab meat.  Peel & eat shrimp also excellent as were crab or shrimp gazpachos & mussels . Didn't sample the crawfish as I not a fan but they have that too. My dining companion loved the prime rib but I just rate it an OK as the small rare slice I had was a little tough & the carver who did not speak English well kept motioning for me to do something with my plate which I finally figured out was take it out of the way. Anyway, a small distraction! Desserts good. Liked the caramel brulee & hand scooped ice cream though skip the cotton candy unless you in need of a sugar fix. Ordered unlimited chardonnay with dinner but when served we tasted & remarked how sparkly & sweet this chardonnay tasted compared to others until we realized server had misread order & was bringing champagne instead. OK, just went with the flow but had to keep asking server for refills.",

Their food is very fresh and they carry a great selection of items from various cuisines.  I have been there for breakfast and brunch I warmly recommend the smoked salmon, the sausages and also the skewered pork (Brazilian style). For brunch they even have sushi (not too bad) and even kimchi.  Also, the place has a large selection of delicious desserts.  The reason I did not give them 5* is the somewhat high price ($20 for brunch and $15 for breakfast), but totally worth the money.",

Its stations include salad, seafood, Italian, Asian, Mexican, pizza, pasta, and desserts - complete with gelato, tiny tarts, and a chocolate fountain. I'm probably forgetting some type of food, but I hope you get the picture - an amazingly vast array of choices - even for a buffet.  For my first plate, I marched right up to the prime rib station and asked for a slice. I got it with the horseradish sauce - strong but in a good way - along with broccoli, a couple of red potatoes, and a piece of maki sushi from the Asian station nearby for my walk back to the table.    The service was great. Our waiter was very experienced, once holding a tray of dirty dishes, probably amounting to almost 20. He joked with my mom denying her a change in beverage choice from iced tea to coffee, and we almost fell for it. When my Oma asked for a wet nap, he brought a small handful and knowingly said she could take them in her purse. Of course, the man serving the prime rib was friendly. The second time I came up and got less horseradish sauce, he jokingly gave me a hard time about not taking more. Even one of the other diners encouraged me to take more food at the seafood section. Hesitant about how many crab legs or shrimp to take, I got his support in thinking that I could finish it.  Not even out of fear of judgment but more to save you the details, I'm not going to attempt to list everything I ate at this buffet. Basically, the variety and service impressed me.",

In most buffets you could hit every section of food a couple of times but this one was so big that you really had to just narrow down to choosing a couple. One of which MUST be the dessert area. Omg...tiny little carrot cakes, apple crumbles, frozen yogurt, chocolate brownies....I really wish I could have taken a doggie bag home.   Service was great too. Be warned though--they close at 10 and stop putting fresh food out at 10:30 so if you want ample time to eat get there earlier. They were really nice and accommodating to our big group and let us in right before 10. (Hey, Vegas--why does everything CLOSE before you've even had lunch?!)

My expectations were kinda low after reading the reviews on here, and the intent was to only grab a snack. That turned into 2 plates. Their sushi was really good, my brother and I made 2 big plates of nachos and split them, the other Asian selections were tasty, and it was a pretty good variety overall. I stayed away from the crab and heavy meats since this was only supposed to be a snack before hitting the Rio a few hours later, but my appetite ended up getting hijacked here. I am curious to try their brunch, especially knowing it can't be worse than Planet Hollywood's. There was also no line here at like 5pm on Saturday evening. The service wasn't bad, especially since the staff displayed a sense of humor joking around with us several times during our meal. Overall, I'd say this is still 3rd of the 4 we went to, but I would definitely come back.",

But the buffets have their draws. First of all, Harrah's has great promotions. If you sign up for a Total Rewards club, you save on the buffet price, and you get a coupon book for $5 off the buffet, so it doesn't end up being too bad of a deal.  Anyway... the food at Flavors: We actually ended up here twice. Once for dinner, once for brunch. Both were excellent. I completely disagree with statements about typical buffets when it comes to this place. Everything was good. A full, fresh, full of options salad bar, a seafood bar, an omelet station, prime rib carved, pasta, pizza, mexican bar (make tacos, enchiladas, anything you want), GELATO, and many flavors of it. I didn't even make it to the dessert bar, but they had sooooo much there as well.   I thought everything was extremely fresh and even the display was nicer than I expected. It was CLEAN. Refreshed. Nothing spilled all over the place. Really, it was a great place, and I think if you're trying to please a group of people - it's perfect. They have everything. I think it was around $25 a person with our coupon for dinner, and a little less for brunch.",

Besides this, nothing worth waiting 1 hour in line for. (I had a diamond card and didnt wait or else serious waste of time and money.) Its like they are insulting you, teasing you with bad food and making fun of you for being a jack-ass in line to come eat here and pay 25-30 bucks. I would break down food-by-food, but serioously, every item sucks ass except those legs. Pretend its a red lobster all you can eat crab leg special, and you will be happy. Crab claws suck, stick to the legs, and enjoy your beverage",

The fact that there is little to no line should be a clue to the quality of fare they are putting out.  It is my hope that they spend a few extra dollars to hire a trained Executive Chef.  It is well worth the few dollars more to eat at the M Life Buffet or Backchannel Buffet. My advice if you find yourself at Flavors Buffet turn around and find another place to eat. I know for certain that we will never go back.",

None of the sushi or seafood was edible and everything was developing a thick crust over the top of it from sitting out under the heat lamp for so long. Definitely not worth the money that we paid and I'll think twice about coming back next time. I understand that we were coming in near closing time, but shouldn't there be a discount for that if the food isn't going to be up to par? I don't mind paying full price, but the food has to be fresh and appealing.",

Everything else was just alright. They seem to focus on individual mini baskets with egg rolls and other fried foods. Flavors is a little on the small side with selection compared to other hotel's buffets. The seating was typical yet clean. The waiter was somewhat attentive.

    "text": "This place was a complete joke, if it wasn't for the fact I got it off a Groupon and only paid half price I'd be pissed asking for a refund. So to start the reason for the two stars and not one was simply they have grab legs and prime rib at a half decent price.  Now to start the details of this horrible experience.  The service: Ok to start 4 of us went to dinner this evening, my wife and my friends wife are full Mexican however they look white and are fluent in both English and Spanish. We ordered a round of Coors light's and bloody marry's. The drinks came and the beers were seriously room temperature and the bloody marry's were so spicy they were undrinkable. The waiter overheard my wife and my friends wife speaking Spanish, and started conversating, we later found out through conversation in Spanish only now that the waiter saw \"us white people\" and kept poring in Tabasco and grabbed the warmest beers he could find. This was just so him and his fellow staff could have a laugh. As soon as he found out we were Mexican and spoke Spanish the quality of service took a 180. Without asking the waiter brought us 4 ice cold beers, new bloody marry's and wine for our wives. Our drinks always got filled and he even brought all of us beers and drinks to go plus two decks of playing cards. I found this to be a complete joke and no wonder why tourism is down.  The food: The food was of a typical buffet, the crab legs were ok, the prime rib was ok as well, although in my opinion it was over cooked. I did feel the buffet was a bit smaller then the ones I had been to at the other casinos. The deserts were horrible, and some of the worst I had ever seen at a buffet. I tried every single one and not one was I able to muster a 2nd bight and this wasn't just me all four of us at the table felt the same way. The ice cream was the only desert I was able to eat and it wasn't to bad either I think it may have been made in house.   In summary I will never go back to this buffet unless I hear that it gets revamped, nore do I recommend this buffet to anyone. If you get a groupon give it a try otherwise try a different buffet such as the M resort, green valley ranch....",

    "text": "3 plates of crab legs! I'm not even kidding but that was all I ate at this buffet! I can't explain it but my lust for crab legs escalated significantly in the last 5 weeks or so. It's all I want, it's all I think about and at The  Flavors Buffet at Harrah's, it was all I got. =)))  Of course I consulted Yelp before heading to the Flavors buffet! It had good reviews and decent pricing so we checked it out! My friend knew of my crab legs addiction so when he saw one diner with crab legs on his plate, he told me about it and I made a beeline for my precious crab legs.  I cracked my first one and dipped it in the butter sauce and I was in heaven! It was so huge, so juice and soooo yummy!  Prolly the task of getting the meat out in one big piece and actually being successful at it adds up to my enjoyment.  If the rest of the buffet was good, I'd never know but I still give them 4 stars because of the reaction of everybody else on my table and mainly my happy crab leg-filled tummy.  As I sat there devouring my crab legs, they've gone on at least 2-3 trips back to the buffet and they made really good comments on the ribs, grilled meat and sausages.  For roughly $24 a person, it was hella worth it, wide selection and scrumptious dishes, it was a winner! Can't wait to go back! Bookmarked! =)",

Flavors is $23.77 and if you have a club member card they will shave off $2...hey, that goes far on the penny slots! :)  They have salad, sea food (crab legs are pretty good), Italian, Chinese, Mexican, and other random American food. The desserts are okay, nothing spectacular. They have a large variety of French pastries but they are disappointing. The Creme Brulee taste more like flan, and the cheesecake is mushy. The best is their ice cream/gelato and cotton candy bar so stick to that.   I like this buffet but I don't love it and it's definitely not the best on the strip.",

I had read some of the other reviews before going and I was just a little worried with how our experience would go but for the price, we figured we could give it a shot.   When we first arrived, we were not very impressed- the ladies at the front were not the nicest and certainly not welcoming (almost felt unwelcome) so I was kinda worried we were going to have a bad experience. However, Abba took us to our seats and she was very nice. Our server was Phoung: she was INCREDIBLE! We were so impressed with her service, we NEVER ran out of drinks and she was so attentive.    The food is not bad, especially for a buffet but that's what you have to realize, it's a buffet (quantity vs. quality), I have definitely had worse for buffets. I would probably give the food 3.5 stars overall (but the mexican food was pretty good-especially the quesadillas) and they have a pretty good selection. For the price we paid, we really just couldn't complain, but I don't think I would pay $70 to go there again. If i was going to spend that kind of money, I would probably pay more and try one of the higher end buffets I've heard about.",

The gelato flavors were lacking in exactly that. Flavor. It was very difficult to flag down our servers for plate service and drink refills.   We were seated adjacent to the casino floor, so the cigarette smoke from the floor kept sailing in making our dining experience less enjoyable.  What was really annoying was that they had no restrooms inside the buffet. Being that I didn't know the Harrah's floor layout, it took me about 10 minutes to find a bathroom. I'm surprised I didn't already pee my pants.   Again, the buffet is nothing special and excels in nothing. Majority of the food looked like it had been sitting under the heating lamp or on the steam tray for a long time. I'm glad I didn't pay full price for the buffet. I won't ever come back if I don't have to.",

It was so good, we thought we would come back for dinner. But when we did, it was like we had come to an entirely different establishment. The entire mood and attitude was changed. Trying to get a drink refill was like pulling teeth, eventually the original lady that was supposed to be our server disappeared entirely and another guy pretty much adopted our table since we were calling out to him so often. The cooks were lazier at dinner than at lunch and didn't get anything refilled in a timely manner (particularly the Churrasco pork) and one of them was just plain rude. The 9.99 all you can drink was not as worth it this time as my companions barely got four drinks out of it with all the trouble they had getting served.  Between my six-star lunch experience and my two-star dinner experience, Flavors averages a 4 for on the whole.  I suggest you go for lunch, and if you see Rudy, tip big. He's the man.",

The selection was pretty good and the prime rib they had there was cooked to perfection unlike other buffets that are usually dry and flavorless.   They have plenty of food to pick and choose from. Like cotten candy...yes cotten candy and prime rib, a match made in heaven.  Take an apple or a bananna from the buffet and put it in a bag to take with you. Last thing you want to do is be charged $50 for an apple at the Bellagio.   I would stay away from the clam chowder. It was really thick and I'm sure if you stuck a fork in it and turn the bowl upside down it wouldn't drop. It has the consistancy of paper mache, in fact it might be paper mache.  **We bought the Buffet of Buffet passes for $44.95. We purchased this at 8 PM. I think it's best to have this if you are going to be in town for a while. Get it late so you can get your breakfast, lunch and dinner all in 24 hours**",

The server was so amazingly nice, always joking around with us and compliment us. He's old and he looks like the man from UP. Hehe  Food:  1. Primed ribs: wow super rare... I didn't bother touching it  2. No wine or champaign means no mimosa :( so I just got cranberry juice  3. A lot of Cajun food , which I love. Delicious sausages, chicken, veggies, and mashed potatoes. Corn bread was so bomb! Lots of carbs. Corn was kinda burnt tho.  4.BBQ ribs were mediocre. Someone told me that the meat only falls off the bone if it's over cooked but I guess I like it overcooked. This ribs was yummy and saucey but it didn't come off the bone easily  6.cheesecake was light and creamy. Comes in a really small bowl so you can have self control  7. Free cotton candy that you can take out. Comes in purple, pink, and blue 8. Crab legs were fresh but small. Just grab a bunch so you don't have to keep going back and forth  9.Alfredo and marinara pasta and thai noodles are so good!! The pasta was cheesy and hot. Thai noodles was kinda plain but I'm fine with it  10. Gelatto: mint, chocolate chip, passionfruit, vanilla flavors: yes I have tried them all in one sitting...shhh   The only thing I don't like about this place is that there's no restroom!

I saw this buffet on a few top ten lists, all of which praised it for being far more affordable than the other top-notch Vegas buffets.   My experience was laughably bad. First, it's only $10 cheaper than some of the best buffets in Vegas (Bellagio may be my fave) at $27, and the experience is night and day. Much of the food was mislabeled or had no name cards at all, and when I'd mention that fact to the cooks behind the counter, they literally shrugged.  I asked to move to a table near an outlet so I could charge my phone, and the waiter told me \"no one will help you there\", so I sat 15 feet from where they sat me... He walked past me 10 times and never got me a drink or said another word to me. The food was just OK. Not as big a selection as the Rio or Wynn, and while I'm not big on shellfish and sea food, I'd say that was the strength of this buffet. The dessert selection was huge, but much lower-quality than any of the top-notch buffets. I ended up eating a make-your-own fajita, which is a bad sign. There are so many better choices, avoid this one.",

We bought the buffet of buffets for a day when we arrived in Vegas at 1 pm on Sunday.   What I like from this buffet were the crab legs, shrimps, prime rib and the galeto with waffle cone. Actually, this buffet has more taste than Wicked Spoon and Carnival World.  The crab legs were bigger and more meatier here and they actually scored them so you don't have to crack it open with the cracker yourself, how thoughtful of them. The chowmein actually had taste and siu mei was pretty good and warm considering this is Vegas not LA, the prime rib was tasty also. The waffle cone had a little sweetness in it and it was pretty fresh.  So overall it has more taste than the other three buffets I have afore mentioned.  Actually, we went back for lunch before we left Vegas on Wednesday afternoon, but this time they didn't have the crab, so not sure if they only served crab on the weekends or Sunday only.  Although this hotel and buffet might not be as new or fancier than the other hotels and buffets, will I come back to this buffet the next time I visit Vegas? We might actually.",

If I don't get the chance to eat here, I will probably go from a 5 foot 2 inch girl to a 10 foot hulk-monster-type creature (w/ pink lipstick).  First things first: The crab legs here are to die for. Die for! I mean where else can you get crab legs that are already sliced down the middle and warmed? The meat is juicy and salty with a hint of sweetness, such perfection should be a hell-sent sin. This is the only place I go to satisfy my urge for crab legs. All the other foods are just great, they have different sections for the different ethnic foods (because racial grouping is only natural even in foods) and I don't remember putting something in my mouth that I didn't like. Prime rib and aus jus was juicy and full of flavor, the perfect combination. The line is never sickeningly long, it's always a moderate length.  Oh, If I could describe every single thing I ate at this buffet I could publish it into a book but for your sake I won't. Just trust me and try this buffet. You'll get your money's worth.  BTW: They have unlimited Gelato! And cotton candy to take home! (faint!)",

We opted for this one because our friends were staying in this hotel and would not be joining us at the pool at Caesars. We read about this one, but only about dinner... so no rodizio?  No line at 8:30... woo hoo! The restaurant was about 1/3 full when we got there. They sat us near the end of the line (or the beginning... opposite of the desserts). Our server seemed the angry type... She brought us our coffee and juice... My friend was joking that they should have dim sum carts so we didn't have to stand. Then a cart filled with juice and sparkling wine rolled by. Ask and ye shall receive.  I got yogurt again, but this time with cottage cheese and canned peaches. There were fresh strawberries with whipped cream. I got some fried bananas and mexican beans... I got a pancake... I got a crepe filled with sweet cheese... I got a biscuit with gravy... some bacon... I didn't have any desserts because get this, I was too full!   This place was good... I would have eaten here three times. The food was really good...",

You will find your typical buffet stations here, asian, mexican, italian, seafood (crab and shrimp), and dessert (gelato and cotton candy included..woohoo)!  The food is very tasty!!! And the prices are just right for a buffet at Harrahs. The whole place is clean and the service employees keep your table clean and your drinks filled!  If youve tried the buffets at the wynn or the bellagio, this is not in comparison..so try this buffet first then start your upgrades cause if you do the wynn or bellagio then come here, you will be disappointed!  Will come here again, and would definitely recommend.  Tip: You can go to the half tickets booths throughout the strip and buy the buffet for almost half the price!!! The nearest booth will be at the mall across from the wynn, right next to starbucks!! Worth the walk, especially for large groups.",

First off, the \"Ultimate Buffet\" applies to about eight of them in various hotels. Sort of a stuff-your-face day pass, if you will. If all you want is one meal, you pay a much more reasonable fee. On that particular Sunday I think we paid less than $20 each - and I easily ate twice that in crab (the point of the whole thing).  There is something for everyone. Salads, seafood, pasta, pizza, carved meats (which we witnessed them smoking in-house), Chinese, sushi, Mexican, Italian and desserts for days. Almost every single thing we ate was delicious, definitely worth the money and the wait.",

The service was good, but they weren't very busy and it was dinner time on a Friday night.  Mot having to wait in line at a buffet on a Friday night should have told us to go somewhere else! We used to buy the 24 hour pass for $48.  It was nice to have dinner and come back in an hour or two for desert, instead of stuffing yourself all at once.  The price has gone up to $78, making it way to expensive for the small amount of food we eat.  We didn't buy the passes this time, just paid for dinner.

By the way, they make some pretty creative items, especially desserts! They even had 5 flavors of cotton candy one of the times I've eaten there!

She served the tables on both sides of us but somehow we were magically invisible.  According to Buffet of Buffets brochure, Flavors is known for their Brazilian BBQ & Prime Rib. The Brazilian BBQ was burnt and hard. After struggling to finish the 1st cut and taste it, I was done. The prime rib was so red and undercooked that I couldn't even cut it. Next entree.  The taco bar was reasonable. Had nearly every imaginable topping available with shredded pork and beef.  Red new potatoes were good as well as the corn on the cob. Mac and cheese was alright. The make-your-own-salad bar was average at best. Most of the ingredients came from the fridge - nothing was fresh.  Lots of desserts to choose from - Gelato ice cream, various pies, fresh fruit. This was one of the most enjoyable things about the entire buffet except most are so heavy that you want to sit and rest afterwards. I sat at a blackjack table.",

There was a burrito bar where you can make your own burrito with either carne asada or chicken asada.  Both meats tasted like crap so I didn't have a burrito.  The guacamole didn't taste like real avocados.  The prime rib was ok and all that special.  The service was also pretty slow.  Our waitress disappeared for a period of time and was a real disappointment here.  Overall, not one of the buffets I would choose to go to next time around for the BoB.",

I wonder if Harrah's realizes that they lose money by making us sick so that we were stuck in the room rather than on the floors gambling and having a good time?",

It's $40 bucks for unlimited access to all those buffets for 24 hours. If you time it right, you can catch two dinners and a lunch so it'd totally be worth it.   Check it out: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.harrahs.com%2Fbuffets%2Findex.html&s=6eed292bdb0c39e388d213ba43ac3616b36b89c05e65c0b2dc5e46bc03a7b86b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">harrahs.com/buffets/inde...</a>  As a buffet in general, this place is pretty good. There's enough variety.. even gelato. Granted, the dishes, decor and desserts are not as extravagant as other buffets (ahem, bellagio), but it's not too bad and isn't too expensive. I would recommend dropping by if you have the \"Buffet of Buffets\" pass.",

I think the awful waitress we had may have skewed our opinion a bit but the food was barely average at best. The waitress greeted us to take our drink order and we both ordered a Coke. She asked us how thirsty we were because if we were thirsty, she wanted to bring us each two glasses because she didn't want to have to make extra trips back to our table just to bring us another drink. I could possibly understand if the restaurant was slammed but there was so many empty tables and she had plenty of time to lean against the waitress station to chat with other waiters and text on her phone. I can't think of any one thing we tried that was worth raving about. As I said earlier, it was average at best but there were several things the we tried that remained on our plate as we went to try something else. We do love Vegas buffets but there are far more to choose from at this price or less that make Flavors not worth the time or money. The only benefit that came from visiting here was the Carnival Court just outside the casino that we went to after dinner. I'm going to have to find a place to review that. Excellent place to spend a Saturday night!",

They advertise unlimited crab, though the crab legs were dry and not fresh tasting at all.  The peel and eat shrimp were better, but nothing special.  The roast turkey was dry and didn't have much flavor.  The veggie sushi roll had a very odd taste to it.  After being shown to our table, we never saw a server again and were not offered any drinks.  Soft drinks/juice/water/coffee/tea were self serve, but if you want a glass of wine with dinner, forget about it!  The only things we really enjoyed were the salad bar, shrimp & the coconut macaroons.  Defnintely not worth $34 per person!!

You never know what you are getting with a buffet such as how long the good has been out for or who has sneezed on what or who has touched what and put it back, etc.  I love how they have divided up the sections into different cultures of food such as seafood, Mexican and Japanese. I stayed away from the Japanese section with the sushi because you never know with the raw fish how long it has been out there and if it has been stored properly. I was also disappointed with the Chinese food section. All they really had was dim-sum, dumplings and fried rice. Where was the sweet and sour pork or the ginger beef especially?  The dessert section was definitely the best with all the ice cream you could imagine. However I was surprised that the salad bar was hidden and that the dessert section was at the front rather than at the end as dessert usually happens at the end of the meal but they had the dessert section first.",

I went there to eat with my girlfriend and should have notice there were more employees than customers during lunchtime.  It was over $60.00 for the two of us and it was probably the worst food I've eaten in a long time.  We started out at the salad bar area and there were only about three things that could be added to the lettuce.  Then we went to the meat and got food section.  Really-for $60.00 you offer turkey (dried to the point of being considered almost like jerky), some sausage and some pork on a stick that was smoked from a wood fire.   Actually that wasn't too bad.  There were no fresh vegetables.  Have you ever been to a buffet and the food just looked stale!   Yep.  That's what I mean.  I absolutely love mashed potatoes and gravy.   Oh my.  The gravy tasted sour and the potatoes..... can't even think of a word to describe this texture and flavor.  It was horrible.   So, before you step into the buffet, just sit for a minute outside and watch the people that go in and come out.   And, if you're so inclined, ask to take a peek at the buffet before you pay.   Whatever you decide....good luck and have fun in Vegas!",

We walked by about 2 hours later and the line was a mile long - so that was definitely a benefit of going off-hours if you can.   Overall it was a hit and miss buffet, as I'm assuming many of the standard casino buffets are. I actually really enjoyed most of my dinner, but that is because I just cast aside all the things I tried and didn't like. It seems really wasteful to me, but some of it was just that bad. Among the things that were that bad were the ribs, the chicken, and some of the vegetables I tried. And the hushpuppies were among the worst things I've ever ingested - I'm not sure they weren't meant to be dog food instead.   However, the seafood selection was fantastic, and I indulged myself on many oysters, crab legs, crawfish (I was ecstatic someone from New Orleans!), shrimp, and salmon. I had an overflowing plate of each before I threw in the towel and called it a successful buffet.   I was too stuffed to go for any of the desserts at that point, but there didn't seem to be too many that looked that great anyways.   The staff was also very friendly and available, but again we were some of the only patrons at the time.   If you're a seafood fan, this buffet hits the mark. If not, you might want to look elsewhere.",

I wasn't planning to have breakfast the following day when I checked out. However I decided to get breakfast for the following reasons: 1) I got a coupon for $5 off for breakfast as a Total Rewards Member 2) Instead of gambling I still can get points by eating here.  After the first plate I lost my appetite. Here's why. The first plate included scrambled eggs. I like my scrambled eggs wet but something was wrong with these eggs. They left a bad taste in my mouth and stomach. Gordon Ramsay said he could tell if a person can cook well if it knows how to cook scrambled eggs. Well someone should've vetted the person or people who cooked theses scrambled eggs. I ended only have three plates of dishes because of the scrambled eggs. The rest of the items were pretty good like ham, sausages, hash brown, and blue berry pancakes. But I always felt to determine how good a breakfast buffet is by how well cooked are the scrambled eggs.   My advice is if you won big money from the slot machine I suggest skip this place and treat yourself to a higher quality restaurant.",

Since we were going to the Improv at Harrah's afterwards, it made sense to have dinner there. Wish we hadn't. The food was terrible. The crab legs were still frozen and tasteless. I let them sit there for a while hoping they would thaw, but even then the flavor was awful. There is too much meat and not a lot of side dishes. The dessert table sucked. I'd go to Caesars over this place anytime!",

We also ate Eat Up buffet at Harrah's in St. Louis, Mi. All three of these buffets of Harrah's in Laughlin, Rincon, and St. Louis were always known for their variety of food and deserts.

For a weekday, we actually had to wait in line for a good 15 minutes since we went with the dinner rush. Our server or rather, the busboy was courteous and fast with clearing up the tables.  As for food, I aimed for the more expensive stuff such as steak, shrimp, oyster, and lobster (didn't want to fill up on cheap carbs).  I wasn't too disappointed, but I got tired with my food choices eventually.  Their dessert section is huge and they even served sugarless cakes!  I was hoping for some tiramisu cake but was disappointed that they didn't serve any.  The clam chowder was too \"thick\" and salty; even pouring it made it look all gooey.  They also have a selection of Asian food but that didn't appeal much to me, but they also had small sesame balls that made me miss dim sum.  Given the variety of food choices in Vegas, I don't think I would come by again unless it is because I'm staying at Harrahs.",

The salmon was grey, the salad bar had 20 dressings but 4 toppings,  much of the food looked like it had been out for days (I've seen better corn on the cob in a farm animal feed bin). The prime rib was very good, though, and some things, while looking sad, tasted all right. I've definitely had better. My rating: Staff = C, Decor = B,Food = C",

The meats were all low grade cuts and the buffet was clearly designed for quantity not quality. The redeeming part was the Chocolate fountain and the Cotton Candy.

The $5 breakfast buffet (with card) at Palace Station had more tastier selections.  While everything I had was meh to mediocre, the bacon stood out as being particularly bad.  It was served in a bin in bits and crumbly pieces instead of strips.  The waitress never came over to serve us our drinks - I had to get the manager,  Lunch:  Again, at $24 a complete rip-off for very limited selections and an almost non-existent salad bar.  None of the food is what one would consider premium, and was on par (if not as good) as a Golden Corral buffet.  Belileve me, if you must eat a buffet on the Strip or near Strip with similar or slightly higher prices, you will do much better at Le Village in Paris, Spice Market in Planet Hollywood, or Carnival World in Rio.",

I just thought it funny that they had the crab legs next to the pancakes with a big pan of melted butter between the two. I never feel like I eat enough to warrant a buffet though and I didn't here.

It's a shame we didn't come here first!  As far as a breakfast buffet goes it was awesome for the price!!!! Such a large breakfast spread compared to others.  The fruit was to die for, just the right amount of ripeness, strawberries were soooo good!  Pancakes, waffles, cereal, tons of different ways potatoes were prepared, good selection of fruit for this time of the year, oatmeal, GRITS (I was sooooo happy about this), tons of pastries, our drinks were always kept full. Just thinking about this places I wish I was still in Vegas and could go to it for Breakfast tomorrow.   For the price it is a very, very reasonable selection and quality.  You won't leave breakfast from here anything less than stuffed!  After all breakfast is the most important meal of the day!      Will definitely be eating here again the next time we roll in to Vegas!!",

We found a groupon coupon which was $30.98 for two people with unlimited beer and wine :) That's a steal Download Groupon   I was sick with a head cold so my eating was limited but if I wasn't sick then you'd probably have to carry me out haha  Anywho for my dishes, I had Prime Rib which was super yummy, shrimp with cocktail sauce which was also very good, corn on the cob (can't go wrong with that), and a shrimp scampi which I kinda thought was going to be bad but it was good :)  For dessert I had hot tea and a chocolate mousse cake which totally just hit the spot  The servers and cooks were very friendly and love feeding people   I would visit this buffet again and would expect the same great quality",

I did manage to find a great groupon deal for 2 with unlimited drinks (alcohol) for $38.00 Cant beat that....   We came on a Sunday Evening for dinner - I started with salad - No complaints , fresh lettuce and spinach - fresh and sweet tomatoes, fresh croutons ... fresh fresh fresh !  We are off to a good start... Then loaded up on Crab Legs and Shrimp - ! Yum!   Perfectly chilled ! Sauces were great... Fried Shrimp was hot and crispy - best way to have it!   Next onto meat !   Prime Rib was great, Chicken wings great,Korean BBQ Ribs great - Everything was delish!!!!  So full after all that that we didnt do much on the desert, but I did snag a bag of Cotton Candy !!!!     Overall a good experience.. I have to think this is one of the better Buffet's in Vegas, if you get a groupon - Its a must try!",

My dad had to settle for prime rib and potato and I tried to eat a salad but the tomatoes were rotten. This is the first time we have ever spent less than 20 mins at a buffet and left without tipping. So gross definitely not coming back. I suggest no one else does either it isn't worth it.

Well, my wife and I were tired with glazed-over eyes from jet lag and too much slot play, and seeing we were playing at Harrah's we decided what the hey, let's go! Yet again we were underwhelmed by this buffet. I do like the fact that they ask you when you pay what you want to drink as it means you don't have to sit down and wait for the waitress to come before heading up to grab your first plate of slop, but that's where the compliments end. The rolls were hard, the salad bar doesn't offer a whole heck of a lot, the shrimp is peel and eat (come on!), and...and...ok their fried chicken was pretty decent.  Service still stunk like the last time...our waitress would run away for 5-10 minutes at a time (where she went nobody knows...was she at the craps table?). I left nary a dollar for her as her apathetic attitude made me sad inside.   If you're hungry and want to eat quantity over quality, this is your place. Or if you like fried chicken as it wasn't half-bad. Maybe they should rename the buffet to \"Flavors, our service stinks but our fried chicken isn't half-bad!\"",

Not only do they have ice cream and all the toppings (Including hot toppings!), but they also have a great selection of mini cupcakes (let me recommend the lemon... yum!) AND cotton candy to go!  So, if you just want to get your dessert on, I would check this out.  They have huge slices of pies and cookies and other little bites, but a really nice selection of GOOD stuff.  Although, they have swapped out doing Creme Brulee for a flan style custard.  Dummy heads.  The second reason is while they don't have 500 tastes, the ones they do have are pretty darn good.  The prime Rib was PERFECT.  They have containers for your condiments.  The service is good and it felt like an overall value.  We were doing the Buffet of Buffets so I didn't look at what the price was when we went for lunch, but I'm sure it was over $20.  The only negative was they made you take a picture before you went in and hand you this giant fork and spoon, which kind of grossed me out since I had just washed up in preparation for eating!  When did taking your picture before entering a buffet become a thing???  No thanks.  I'd eat here again.",

I expected a little more considering Las Vegas has a lot of great buffets. I checked the reviews on Flavors and although their were mixed reviews, most recent reviews were positive so we took a risk anyways. I did try a little of everything, but found that I was only able to have 1 bite before moving it off to my discard plate. Only thing that was positive was the desert bar gives the option of a Ice cream cone. The Cookies and cream was good. We had a fantastic meal the following night at a steakhouse at Excalibur that was only $20 more than Flavors, so wished we had saved the money and spent it someplace else. I'd go to In-N-Out before going back to this Buffet.",

No napkins, a cracker for our crab, no one asked if we needed anything. Service was just non existent. I had no problem with not leaving a tip, because no one deserved it.

Would recommend this as option for a cheaper buffet. We also had dinner there because we had the 24 hour pass. Would not recommend the 24 hour pass, as it takes 4 meals to make it worth it. They state 4 different buffets but spice market was horrible and the garden at flamingo was closed.  Dinner included 3 types potato, maccheese, fried chicken, basic chinese and desserts were few but good.",

    "text": "Overpriced!  I was very surprised at the expensive buffet price.  Around $80 for three of us on a Wednesday night.  Same price for a weekday night as a Friday or Saturday. It was late and we were hungry, and couldn't decide on what we wanted so we gave it a go.  Terrible! Let's start with the salad. It was a little wilted and browning on the edges. (not terrible if you cover with dressing and cheese) There was a cold turkey or chicken (can't remember) dish near the salads that was pretty tender and good. Next stop my favorite Crab Legs! They were terrible! Decent sized, I guess. But they tasted as if they had been slightly opened and submerged in water for several days.  Soggy and tasteless. I've never had soggy crab legs. It was disgusting. Even drowning in butter didn't help this mess.   Prime Rib was ok. No real complaints there.  However, I was really disappointed that they didn't have Banana Cream Pie, that's like a buffet staple. Instead I had a fruit torte and a carrot cup cake.  Both were pretty good. The dessert station definitely looked the best.  They do have a $10 add on for all you can drink. If you eat here, I think you should go for the all you can drink, because maybe being drunk will help the food taste better.  Also, the soda was terrible. It seemed like the carbonation was out, but they changed it and it was still not good. They also wouldn't give us bottled water \"because we weren't Diamond Plus  members\"  Ridiculous!",

The hotel we were staying at offered a coupon for this place making this less than $20 a person so we ended up going to two buffets this trip (highly NOT recommended unless you can control your portions).  The food is extremely dry (even their pasta?!) and very lacking in flavor. It tasted like everything had been sitting out for hours. Not fresh at all...and it was lunch time! My friends always joke about coming here, that's how terrible it was...to me food is no joke so I don't even =p  The only good thing was that they had a big ice cream selection that was actually pretty good... but maybe that's the desperation talking.  If you're only going to one buffet go to cesars or bellagio!",

We found that Harrahs buffet is better than the Wynn (which claims to be high quality). Harrahs definitely beat the Wynn on their offerings. But I must admit Harrahs didn't have a good dessert offering like the Wynn. But get this, Harrahs serves crab legs and shrimp and a lot of seafood for brunch! The Wynn did not!   So you can guest what we ate. 3 plates of crab legs, shrimp and mussels each, 2 plates of prime rib. And then some other fillers. Dessert wasn't that great but it decent. No lines!   Also the drinks came coming. I like it when low end buffets tries to lure people in by offering better things than the high end ones. We would be happy to come back to Flavors for lunch! Also you get discount if you have a players card.",

To start off when we were sat the server didn't take our drink order so it took 10 minutes to get drinks we paid extra for. Next whenever we needed something we would try to get the attention of the servers and they wouldn't just walk past as quickly as possible without even acknowledging us. We also had to move all of our empty plates ourselves. No one ever came over to pick up a single empty plate. We had to move them onto a server station which became too full as well. I also witness employees moving dirty dishes from one table to another table with dirty dishes and then seating guests in the tables and not wiping them down! I honestly hope the management can get this place together. It has great potential with the most lazy employees I've ever seen.",

He was very nice and quick to clear the table and refill our mimosas without having to ask.  The ladies that greeted us were all wearing football jerseys and that was a plus for me regardless of their teams...even though on was wearing a Colts jersey!!! Yes! Represent!! Lol.   Now on to the good part, the food.  I was full and did not ear the rest of the day because the food was so good and I ate so much.  I shouldn't be happy about that part lol.  I had fried chicken, mac n cheese, sweet potatoes that were sliced lengthwise and thin (I wasn't ready and got too much lol) and dressing!  There were also Mexican and Asian to choose from.  To top it all off, I got a scoop of cookies and cream ice cream.  Not that nasty soft serve machine that only gives vanilla and chocolate.  There were so many choices for entrees and desserts.  I think everyone will find something that they like.",

SHAME ON YOU FLAVORS, SHAME.  My partner and I had bought a groupon for the brunch buffet here, which we were excited for. We went around noon, or a little after, when we were stopped by the cashier lady. She told us our groupon was not valid because it was a breakfast option ONLY available Sunday through Thursday (it was Sunday). We clarified that the groupon said it was valid for Sunday, and considering they only offer Brunch and no breakfast option, it must have been valid during Brunch hours, or else why would it be valid on a Sunday....riiiight?!   She started to get annoyed and telling us to leave and come back on a day that served breakfast. She also said \"YOU WILL NOT FIND ANY BREAKFAST OPTIONS HERE AT THIS HOUR. WHAT TIME IS IT?! DO YOU THINK THERE'S BREAKFAST BEING SERVED HERE? GO AND COME BACK SOME OTHER TIME WHEN ITS BREAKFAST. WHAT YOU PAID ISNT WORTH WHAT WE SERVE FOR OUR BRUNCH BUFFET\" Though there is breakfast becuase its brunch.... right? that's what brunch is.. breakfast and lunch. Also, if they didn't want people to purchase groupons and use them for their buffet, why put them on the website?!  She kept yelling at us and waving her hands as if to slap my partner. She got so angry, waving her hands at my partners face, that I decided it was time we left.  NEVER AGAIN. IF THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR PATRONS, THEN YOU DONT DESERVE MY MONEY.

    "text": "We ended up here because we got a deal that offered a BOGO buffet when we upgraded show tickets.  Flavors was a good buffet.  I feel like all the food we tried was good quality, and I enjoyed mostly everything I tried.  They informed us that they recently installed drink machines in the back, so you served yourself drinks, eliminating the need for a wait staff to do that for you.  This is not a huge inconvenience, but it is just a little less service than you get other places.  What is unique about this place is that they had a wood burning grill, so some of the selections available have a real smokey flavor to them, if you enjoy that.  I did for some items, but not others.   Other than the wood fire, you could probably exchange this buffet with any other average buffet and not notice a huge difference.     One other interesting thing my wife and I noticed was that the same exact song played on loop the entire time we were there.  I'm not sure if this is normal but, after noticing it, it became a funny obsession to us, and then ultimately began to drive us crazy.",

This was a good brunch spot, and I feel like we definitely got our money's worth out of it.  Pros: -The food was pretty darn good. Buffets are so hit or miss, but this one had good food and one of those soda machines of the future so you could make whatever flavored soda you wanted. -They have bottomless drink specials. I mean, how can you go wrong with that? -The staff was AMAZING! Everyone there had a great personality and were so hospitable, especially our waiter who had to bring me more mimosas than any one person should consume on a Tuesday.  Pros/Con: -They start switching out breakfast for lunch around 1ish, so we were able to get a plate of good breakfast food and try some of the lunch fair. That can be a good thing, and I appreciated that I got more flavors out of the experience, but I usually prefer to stick with breakfast during a brunch date.  Overall, I definitely recommend looking for a Groupon deal for this as it will be 100% worth it. Heck, it'd be worth it even without one.",

HUGE MISTAKE!!! Very disappointing... Not many food stations to choose from... and from what there was to choose from, didn't look as appetizing as the other buffets we checked out, not even close, shrimp was small and soggy, no clams , no oysters , and the crab legs were not snow crab, but dungeness and very hard to eat. I looked for Chinese , pork fried rice, the only thing I found was vegetable fried rice, which was tasteless. I could go on and on....  I strongly advice you to ask them if you can go in first and preview before deciding.. to eat there!",

That was the case for me in experiencing the worst service on my entire four day vacation in Las Vegas. Flavors has separate lines and decided to ignore the stand by line in favor of the VIP line for 10-15 minutes! Everyone in stand by was getting extremely pissed. The couple in front started shouting for a manager, and I don't blame them. How bad was it? Read on  There was a lull in the VIP line for a few minutes. The cashier (only one stationed) just looked down at her register and ignored the huge stand by until a VIP strolled in. Suddenly she was available and helped VIP waiting time 0! This upset even those that had already checked I and we're waiting to be seated. Absolutely ridiculous! The best part is that these VIPs didn't even spend more for preferential treatment. They had a Groupon deal and spent less than stand by!  It gets better, I was surrounded by empty tables for over 1/2 hour. They were eventually cleared but the staff did not give a crap that there was a huge line of hungry people wanting to be seated. I'm not even sure how much longer it took to get people at those tables since they remained empty when I headed out and passed a lot of angry customers at the entrance.  Stay away! Do yourself a favor and avoid the unpleasant experience",

I got fed up and just yelled at her from across the tables, but she just continued to clean tables.  Luckily another diner told us that they had self serve machines around the corner.

It is okay to make it one of the buffet choices when you stay in Las Vegas since the price is not too bad...",

The food wasn't bad, there was a good selection. But as far as quality...not top notch. I was more so impressed by the dessert. Kept on getting up to try some desserts such as gelato or the raspberry mousse.  Other than those I found myself indulging in crawfish. First time ever that I tried cold crawfish, not too bad.",

There's a good amount of selection here - someone for everyone almost.   The cocktail shrimp is peel yourself and the beef ribs are ginourmous! The dessert was watery and lacking taste - it's usually my favorite part of the meal! Ice cream was good though.   I would only recommend this buffet if you have a coupon, want a quick bite to eat (there's no line), or you have the 24 hour pass and this is the closest place to go.",

Crab legs are cooked in SALTY Salty water and just sit in it and absorb all that salt and get mushy. Salty mushy crabs legs - so gross.  Prime rib was upwards of medium well,  cut your loss and switch it out, ugh.  Virtually everything just felt like it had been sitting in the window way too long.  Finally I went for the creme brulee, pretty hard to mess that up...  And they did....  It had no caramelized sugar on top and sat in a cold case...   I thought to my self;  \"Oh how neat they caramelize the sugar in front of you and make it all fresh!\"  No, they don't. There is no caramelized sugar to CRACK on your freakin creme brullee, they told me \"well there is caramel on the bottom\"  It's not flaun, it's creme brulee damnit.  Not to mention it was totally instant mix from a box.  So nasty.   This place SUCKS. Way better buffets on the strip for a much better value, sure it's 27 bucks, but the food quality is about par with fast food that sit in a window forever.  And yes I still left the waiter 20% cause the only thing I can say good about this place is at least the service was good.  Don't waste your time or money.",

Food wasn't great, but the after-effects were even worse.

The buffet isn't super fancy.  But we thought that the food tasted much better than it looked!  Usually it's the other way around, so we were pleasantly surprised.  Maybe it was the time of day.  We got here around 5:30pm, so it was early for dinner. There were only 2 couples ahead of us in line.  We were prepared to be disappointed but were quite surprised by everything.    The crab legs were nice and hot and fresh.  Peel-and-eat shrimp was nicely chilled and tasted fresh.  Spring rolls were fresh and lightly crispy.  I got the pizza when it must have just come out of the oven, so I got to take the first slice.  It had a lightly crispy crust with plenty of cheese and pepperoni.  It was only my last plate, so I was pretty stuffed by then.  But  it was so good that I couldn't stop eating it!   The desserts were kind of hit or miss.  One cupcake was dry and stale, but the red velvet cupcake was nice and moist.  The chocolate ice cream tasted a little off though, like carob.  It didn't have much of a chocolate-y flavor.    Overall, we were quite happy with our meal and are looking forward to going back.",

Everywhere I read online or in periodicals stated the price as 19.99.  The manager said it was a recent price change that was not reflected online or anywhere else.  This price is higher than many other local buffets.  Unfortunately the higher price did not reflect in the quality of the buffet - the selection of food was average, service was average, and quality of the food was average.  An average buffet price would have been acceptable but the mediocre experience is not reflected in the higher price.    There are many good to great buffets; this is not one of them.",

Add in the fact that it was only a 10 minute wait at prime time dinner time (7pm) when Caesars Buffet had an hour and a half wait, and I was perfectly happy at Harrah's.   It's not mind-blowing.

We watched our waitress talking to another table about fashion. I stopped a different waitress and she said I had to wait for our waitress. okay.

If you don't opt in for the wrist band, which pays for itself in basically two meals, then show your Harrah's card and get a discount.

The dessert area is incredible...I have never seen such a great variety before...complete with 3 different kinds of cotton candy (have you ever seen that before).

    "text": "I have been to this buffet twice now. The first time was this past summer but I forgot to write a review.  I remembered the buffet being yummy with lots of options and most importantly AFFORDABLE.  So when my brother and I ventured over to Vegas for a turn-around trip, I suggested we hit up this buffet to stuff our faces so full that we wouldn't even consider spending money on food for the rest of the trip.   The food wasn't as good as I remembered but it still did what it was supposed to do... fill us to the brim.  We only made it 3 plates in before noticing a new addition to the buffet service... the option for unlimited alcoholic drinks for only $9.99 per person!  The unlimited drinks option includes domestic bottled beer, mimosas, bloody mary's and wine. It is available all day. So really, if you committed, you could buy it for lunch and sit there drinking for 5-6 hours.   I only wish this deal was available without the purchase of the buffet because OH MY GOD... we were sooooooo full after eating and then drinking 6 mimosas each in 45 minutes.  We had stopped into the buffet with 1.5 hours until it closed. The first half hour was spent getting food, eating food, losing our table in the sea of tables, arguing with the waitress because I thought our table had disappeared, getting food, eating food. The final 45 minutes of our time in the restaurant was spent chugging mimosas.  I'm not sure if you have ever tried to chug mimosas, but it is not easy. The carbonation really starts to catch up to you. The first two went down easily. The second two took a little more effort. We started stirring the mimosas before drinking them to make them a little less filling and bubbly. The fifth was a challenge and required some inappropriate pre-drink belching to clear space. The final drink was downright painful. Our bellies were full of food, alcohol and carbonation. I was very surprised that the final mimosa didn't shoot right back out of my mouth for lack of space.   Our discomfort and over-consumption would not have been possible without a very attentive server who completely understood our goal. The mimosas were stronger each time and he was beating us to the punch by delivering our next mimosa as soon as we finished the previous. He even gave us two final mimosas that we just couldn't finish so we gave them to the neighboring table.  We left the buffet clutching our stomachs and waddling a little. But we were happy and a little buzzed.  So long story short; if you go to this buffet, are of legal drinking age and want to challenge yourself with unlimited drinks... show up earlier so you can take your sweet time. The food is good and isn't expensive but the unlimited drink deal is even better. Go Harrah's!  Food part of buffet: 3 stars Service part of buffet: 4 stars Drinks part of buffet: 5 stars Average: 4 stars... hence my rating.",

    "text": "We came here on a Tuesday for lunch and had 2AYCE ($22) and 2AYCD ($10) for the price of the Groupon for $30.98  - In Harrah's - Usually you have to pay for the tax , but the cashier included it with the Groupon. Score! - We took 2 pictures with a spoon and a fork, funny and normal. Pix come out to $25 if you wanna buy it.  - We came around 2-3pm, so the presentation of the food did not look as appetizing, not fresh. The sushi rice was hard and shrimp cocktail was running low.  - The carved steak was fresh and delicious. I helped myself to a couple more slices.  - The variety of the food was standard: Mexican, Chinese, Italian, American, soups and salad, and dessert.  - I enjoyed the hard tacos, always a solid choice for me. As long as there is sour creme a guacamole, its all good. Similar to Feast buffet.  - The Italian food was tasty. I recommend the  clam linguini.  - I usually don't get fried food, but I did try the fried fish fillet and it was good.  - For dessert, the cupcakes are small, so you can help yourself to a variety of flavors.  - Save room for ice cream, especially their mint, so you can sprinkle oreo cookies on top! - For drinks, I helped myself to hot tea, coors light, and a couple mimosas.  - Before you leave, grab some cotton candy to eat while walking on the strip.",

I was at one point mistreated by the steak guy who scoffed at me when I politely asked to have a medium well piece made. He laughed and said all they had was the pieces on display, which were all rare and bloody. I know he was discriminating against me because my dad had his made to order from him like 20 minutes before I walked up to him. No thanks. The seafood selection was great. My dad loves the crab legs. I loved the macaroni and cheese, mashed potatoes, and shrimp. The selection could definitely be better though.   To be honest we might not go back unless we get the generous coupons our hotel gave us. Buy one get one free. The plates cost $30/person The drink is included \"complimentary\" with this price.   The service was below average. We unfortunately had an older waitress who came by like every 30 minutes and we had to flag her down for drinks.   So yeah all of the food was good, but like I said I won't go back unless I get those coupons.",

While flavors is one of the better \"deals,\" you get what you pay for. We should have taken clues from the empty dining room but we still went for it.

The pastas are awesome, the prime rib with au jus and creamy horse radish sauce is comparable to a middle-end steak house, and the Asian foods (mostly Chinese) taste just like panda express, which is a plus in my book.  I was somewhat disappointed with the fresh seafood selection since much of it didn't taste as fresh as I would have hoped, and the crab legs that everyone always goes crazy over were mediocre at best. Also the dessert selection is rather limited, but tasty none the less.  I've been to many buffets on the strip, and for the price you can't really beat this one.",

I was very impressed with the large # of options available during breakfast. They had the typical breakfast fare as well as taco/mexican items, gelato and dessert.   I liked that our drink order was on the ticket so that our server knew what to bring without us having to sit an wait. Our service here was was very good.   I felt the biscuits and gravy were decent for a buffet. The bacon was cooked just right and I am very picky. The grits were not very good. The oatmeal looked good and had self-serve toppings but I did not try it. The fresh fruit, especially the strawberries was very good. They had a nice yogurt bar with various toppings. I really enjoyed the vanilla yogurt with blueberries and granola. I had a mini brownie to cap off the meal. One of the better brownies I have every tried. I could not get over how moist it was and how flavorful the chocolate was. I really wanted to try another. I also wish I would've had room and the nerve to try the gelato for breakfast.   Note they also had a cappuccino machine which was a nice touch (I did not try).   Will definitely return for the breakfast buffet.",

Their dessert section is large and they have cotton candy that they allow you to walk out with so that  was cool. I came because I purchased the buffets of buffets and this was the closest to our hotel.",

The waiters were surly and unprofessional, dropping off two of my sodas and leaving forever, arguing within earshot, not looking you in the eye.  The selection was terrible, salty, and of low quality.  The only thing I enjoyed here was the cotton candy, and guess what, TI has that too!  And somehow, it is a better quality cotton candy.  Keep walking!",

I will not go into what I got, since it was pretty much one of everything. But it was a short wait, all things considered, since most buffets make long lines. The price was decent, around $20 which includes your drink and soft served ice cream machine. Great way to recover from an extreme hangover.",

There is a very large selection of different types of food and they always have crab legs and shrimp (YUM!). By far the best part of it is the dessert section. There is every kind of pie or cake you could think of. They also had a chocolate fountain where you could dip strawberries, rice crispy treats, marshmallows, bananas....anything really! It was so good I ate a whole plate of desserts with things stacked on top of other things! I will always come back to this buffet =)",
