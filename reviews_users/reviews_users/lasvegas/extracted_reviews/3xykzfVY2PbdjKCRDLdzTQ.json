We are there at least once a month and the food and service never fails. The owner, Freddie, is fabulous, the sushi chefs are always friendly (we usually eat at the bar) and Cindy is our favorite waitress. :) My boys love the hibachi chicken, steak and noodles. I can't say enough good things about this joint. Samurai is our \"Cheers\". Whether you get All You Can Eat sushi, sit at the sushi bar, at a table, or at a hibachi table, it's all good.

    "text": "Really this experience deserves a -1 star review the only reason why I'm giving it 2 stars is because I came in once before and my server was great and the food was ok for the price and convenience. Unfortunately things have drastically changed from the last time I was here. To start the minute I walked in with my daughter it took a few minutes from the guy up front to even look up and acknowledge us then he just took off expecting us to follow him to the table without saying anything. Next it took 15 minutes for someone just to come to the table and say hi and take drink orders. I figured it's ok it looked like he was by himself and had a couple of tables I decided to be patient and giving it a chance. After waiting another 5 minutes for a water and a sprite. I finally see the server coming with our drinks but then stops puts the drinks down 5 feet away from me picks up food for the table next to us and just carries on. meanwhile another 10 minutes go by and I'm still just staring at my drinks from a far. Now I see there is another server working. A guy who came in 20 minutes after me gets seated and water within a few minutes and the final straw is when the other server walked by my table and drinks sitting on the counter twice and nothing said or done. At that point I.just got up and left WORST SERVICE EVER!",

    "text": "Man, what an interesting experience tonight.  I have never felt compelled to write this sort of review, but hopefully it helps the management to get their crap together.  I will say that I have been to their first establishment in BHC, and for an old McDs building this place is surely an upgrade.  Not fantastic by any means, but a decent steak and ok sushi.  Tonight at the Sunset location, however, something was REALLY off.  The sashimi portions were small for the price, which would be fine for higher-quality fish, but this was decent, run-of-the-mill quality.  The bigger issue with us, however, was the service.  I ordered sashimi a la carte and my wife did AYCE.  The server was keen to interrupt after the first order roll to lay out the \"we will charge you for what you don't eat and we don't do half rolls\".  So our part of the deal was to follow the rules and her part to bring the food.  She failed miserably.  Only that one roll was consumed after 20-25 minutes and she was not stopping by to take any more orders...it was almost seeming that she was avoiding eye contact with us...eventually we asked one of the bussers (who was generally attentive) if the wife could order AYCE from him, he hesitantly took her order and also refilled our drinks.  About 50 minutes into the 60min limit, the waitress drops off the order list, mumbles something and walks away, again not taking the order or even addressing us directly.  About ten minutes later the wife stops her, orders a couple more items and eleven minutes later she brings the bill.  From then, we waited another 20 minutes for her NOT to pick up the bill, and we had to go to the bar so we could pay and leave.  So that was our experience.  Needless to say it was memorable for the wrong reasons, but perhaps it was a really REALLY bad (not busy) wednesday night.",

We ordered Steak and Chicken and after eating for 15 minutes, I noticed a piece of hair in my food. I asked to speak with a Manager, and the lady said \"there is no manager here today, what is wrong?\" I told her there was food, and another guy came to the table. He was nice enough to take care of the entree but asked if it was my hair. The original waitress didn't come back after like, as if she was scared. It was not an experience that was worth the money you would save there vs. going somewhere like Benihana. I would not recommend it to anyone!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "Hands down the worst sushi place I have been to in the las vegas area.  I was getting ready for work and I still had a hour and a half before I had to leave so i wanted to grab some sushi.  I was thinking about heading back to one of my better spots but a friend told me that this place was great so I went here instead.  When I walked in I was semi greeted by a hostess as I stood there for about 2 min or so.  I asked for a table on the sushi side and she seemed a bit confused that I wanted to sit by myself.  It took them over 10 min to bring water to my table.  After that a nice gentleman took my sushi  order.  I was doing the ayce just to try it out.  I order a few pieces of nigiri and two rolls.  It took over 30 min for them to come to my table. After that I never saw my server again.  The rolls were dry, the quality of fish was not that great.  and after another 25 min of waiting for  a server  I gave up.  A new server came to me quite rude asking if I wanted anything else.  I had to go to work so i just said no and I wanted my check.  It took them 25 min to check on my table but just a min to get my check.  I was quite irritated with this place and the price is much more expensive then any other lunch ive been to.  I will stick with either sushi bay, or island sushi.  Avoid this place.",

    "text": "I been in this place twice. The first was two weeks before mother's day and the second was two days before mother's day. I ordered AYCE both times.   The first time, I forgot to say to make the rolls half order, as I assumed the waiters would know that from my previous experiences with other AYCE establishments (Yama, Twister, Sakana, etc), but then all my sushi rolls came out in full orders. I knew I had to finish them all, so I only managed to order 4 rolls and I was stuffed. The rolls are good, but the waiter failed to inform me whether I would order half or full order. Also, for the dessert, I asked if the one time only means that I can order each dessert item one time, but she just restated what I said. We got the woman as our waiter. Can't remember her name. But I just ended up ordering fried ice cream. I asked her if I can order mochi and fried ice cream, she just said one time. And only my fried ice cream came out, not the mochi. Then afterwards, that's when I guessed that you can probably order only one dessert per AYCE visit. She seemed to not understand what I was saying.  The second time I was here, we got the Indonesian waiter and he told us that they don't do half order of rolls but on the menu, it says there's 50% off, so I showed him that and he just kept saying that there's no half roll orders. So I just ordered full like last time, but this time, I had my mom with me so we both shared the rolls. We didn't get to order much, as full orders were a lot. And the dessert, we just ordered one each cause I didn't feel like asking him to clarify it again. Overall, the food here is good, the service slow, but the details and clarifications with the waiters/waitress were a little frustrating at times.",

We were given the option to sit at a table and just order off the regular menu, so that we could receive our food quicker. I took this option and 15 minutes later, not having received any beverages or any kind of service. I opted to just leave. I mentioned this to the Host on our way out and he acted surprised. After further consideration, us leaving was probably for the best. Seeing as how no matter where I stepped in the restaurant the floor was sticky and had an overall dirty appearance.

I carried the check to the register and watched the waiter nearby, before he disappeared. Turns out, he saw that I was not at my table and ran into the parking lot to catch me.

It smelled like natural gas the whole visit and I don't know if this was caused by them starting all the table or if there was a problem. Will definitely go back and hopefully change this to 5 stars.

    "text": "This place wasnt terrible, but i dont know if i would beg to come back.  We arrived to an almost empty restaurant....and we were welcomed by a sign that said \"wait to be seated....including the sushi bar.\"  I waited for a few minutes,  and then told the person i was with that i had to go to the bathroom. While it was clean, it had an odd smell to it.  Finally,  after arriving and going to the bathroom,  we were seated at the sushi bar.   We saw our waitress twice.  When she dropped off our drinks, and when we paid the bill.... she told us to give our order to the chefs. I understand that this is part of sitting at the bar....but, we didnt even get her to refill our water.  The chefs, werent really personable.  Didnt talk to us. Thats part of sitting at the bar, isnt it? To socialize? They didnt even smile at us.   We ordered a screaming o salad, orange crush, bonzai and the surf and turf roll.  The screaming o salad was wonderful. The fish was super tender , and the sauce had just enough zing with crunchy radish  underneath.   The bonzai roll and the orange crush (with lemon slices) were okay, but not memorable. I prefer the Ashley Roll at Spicy Tuna in henderson....larger slices of lemon....which gives a lot more POP of flavor.  The shining roll for us was the surf and turf roll, which seared steak. It had just enough sweet and spicy.   By this time, i guess someone the chefs, and other employees knew sat at the bar next to us...because even employees were coming out of the kitchen to talk to this lady. Luckily  for us, it brought another waiter to refill our waters... but then we were ignored even more by the chefs because they wanted to talk to their friend.   We ordered a last minute hand roll.... which was just handed over to us.... it wasnt put in a plate, or even had a napkin underneath it.   So, the food was okay, but the staff is just what crushes me. Like... i know im not your friend. ....but, I'd appreciate a smile.   Thanked the chefs, paid and left.  6/30.  Got a message from the owner, who told me that they have the lowest prices in town.... okay, well, I'd rather pay more for sushi AND be treated like a guest than pay less AND be ignored. If i wanted to be ignored, I'd  just do take out .   Honestly,  it just felt like a bunch of excuses for the chefs not speaking to me.... Posted picture of the message.. your restaurant isnt the only restaurant thats busy...and believe me, your chefs  sure seemed 100% when their friend walked in!!!",

    "text": "Don't get me wrong. The food is great! I love coming here when the restaurant is practically empty. No other place has rolls that compare in flavor. I hate bland rolls so I really prefer to come here. There are just a few issues I have.   I have been coming here for a little under five years now. I go as often as I can, anniversaries, birthdays, date nights, etc. Everytime I come in I get seated within an okay amount of time considering how packed it gets. Which is understandable. I get asked what we would like and I always do all you can eat. The new waitresses always ask me if I know how it works and I reply yes because I've been coming for a long time.   Some nights when it's busy I don't get my rolls until 20 min after they've taken my paper. Other nights I get most of the items on the paper and they bring back the paper before I get the last roll or two on my list. They almost always forget to being the miso soup I always finish with. Which is very frustrating. Some nights it's also super difficult to get a refill on water until we are ready to leave the restaurant.   It seems that they can't keep waitresses on staff and are always having to hire new people. Which if I was working so much that I was forgetting bits of orders then I would know thay the job is too overwhelming and I would probably quit too.   Five years ago the restaurant had waitresses that were trained well before they were put on busy nights. They were always so nice and quick to take care of you. Sometime in the five years they got new management and everything changed. New waitresses are being thrown in on busy nights and trained on those nights. They quit playing kpop and jpop which I miss a lot! And they watch my table like a hawk. They stare at my friends and I instead of bringing us water and collecting our plates. I'm a hairstylist not some weird looking teenage that is going to run out on the bill.   My suggestions, open up another location because you're almost always looking at a 30 to 60 min wait. And train your girls before you throw them on the floor on a busy night. Also teach them better customer service.",

    "text": "This steakhouse is pretty awesome. I got the bento box lunch special and it was delicious. I was actually surprised at how inexpensive it was also. It was $20 for two of us at lunch time. Typically for a Japanese steakhouse that's as nice as this one, you pay a lot more. Great meal, great price, friendly staff, clean facility. Definitely a must-try if you're in the area.  There were a few downsides that didn't necessarily ruin the experience, but they're definitely the reason why I gave them 4 stars and not 5. When we got there, they sat us down and took our orders all within just a few minutes. It was awesome. Then we waited 25 minutes for our food to come out. She didn't come back at all to see if we wanted something while we sat they're. It was just a dull 25 minutes of waiting. Let's just say this isn't necessarily the quickest lunch spot. Also, in the midst of taking our orders, she pulled out the restaurant phone that was ringing and stopped taking orders to answer the phone. It was kind of awkward and we just sat there waiting for her to come back and finish the orders.   At the end of the day, the downsides that I encountered at the restaurant aren't big enough issues for me to never come back. I actually really enjoyed my time there overall. I'd go back and have another meal there, that's if I have the time to spare.",

    "text": "After spending time shopping sales at the mall, there's no better time to eat sushi rolls...FOR HALF OFF!  Save even more money? Sure, don't mind if I do.  My mom and I came here in the afternoon, and there were 5 cars in the lot.  Yes!  We get in, are seated and ordered drinks right away.  We then placed out order.  I ordered the Spider Roll, Mexican Roll and 007 and my mom ordered the Lobster Roll and Shrimp Tempura Roll.  You know that wiggle dance you do in your seat when food tastes really good?  Well, we were doing that nearly after every bite.  They were all so fresh and tasty. I don't know what they use in their sauces, but they are all so delicious.  My taste buds kept wanting more, but my stomach was telling me enough.  The total for 5 rolls and an iced tea was $35.  Not bad at all and we both left happy and full.  They have AYCE, but I usually am unable to eat enough rolls to get my money's worth.  I did see that there was a time limit: lunch is 45 min and dinner 60 min.  My mom is not the best person with chopsticks, but refused to use a fork.  Our waitress gave her trainers to slip her chopsticks into, showed her how to use them, and my mom kept clicking them, she was so happy.  She also came by frequently to see how we were doing.  I had been here before in the past in the evening when there were more people, but I don't recall my rolls tasting as good as they did when I came back.  Now I crave their rolls just about everyday.  And the service was just as good in the evening as it was in the afternoon. I can't wait till my next trip here.",

All of them were amazing and we received them very quick after ordering. My favorite was the sexy girl. Shrimp tempura, cream cheese, cucumber, jalapeno, spicy tuna with spicy mayo and eel sauce. Not too spicy just perfect. My boyfriends is the Hot Night roll. Spicy tuna, cream cheese, deep fried, topped with spicy crab. Also so good.  We are already planning on what to order next time. We will for sure be back. And the prices are better then any other place we've tried... Way better food, service, and prices then Red sushi downtown.",

The restaurant is big and spacious but sometimes they don't have enough help when it's busy and the service can be lacking, but for the most part it's not too bad if you catch them at non peak times. If you are not in the All You Can Eat mode the rolls are 50% off which is a good deal if you are just in for a small bite. Sushi rolls and Nigiri sushi is very good and they have all the standard items to choose from. When in the AYCE mode you just mark the order form and in a short amount of time you will be served. Apparently there isnt' a time limit like most places, but here at Samurai you can order up to 3 times by the looks of the order form, but I normally can't make it passed the first round and then I \"tap out\". Overall a very cool place for sushi or for a special occasion the teppanyaki tables are fun and the food is really good.  I'm dropping off 1 star because they may not always have enough servers for the amount of business and the glass on the front door has had the same fingerprints on it for as long as I can remember. I guess after a few more months there will be so many finger prints on the glass that it will seem like it's frosted and I won't notice anymore.",

Our server was very good, service was very good at the beginning, but became sporadic toward the end of our meal. Did we wear out our AYCE welcome?

The wait to get our food was a little longer than we anticipated, we surmised this was because they only had a couple people actually working the hibachi grills.  Also, there was no explanation of the system, what to expect, or the menu from wait staff.  We were left to figure everything out on our own.    Once our chef arrived, the experience was fantastic.  The food was ok.  I would not return for the food.  But Peter was very entertaining and made the experience a delight and making up for only \"ok\" food.  I would give the wait staff and food 3 stars, and Peter, our chef, 5 stars.",

As we were ordering, she took my order and almost walked off without taking my wife's. She then brought ALL of the food out on ONE SINGLE plate, even though these were clearly two different items on the menu. I asked her if she could separate the food and she takes the wasabi and ginger off of a plate and tells me to put my sushi on the empty plate (she walks away). To top it off, we pay for our food and she gives us incorrect change because as it turns out, SHE DOES NOT KNOW THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A NICKEL!

So if you make a reservation you sit at the end or edge of the table but a \"walk-in\" gets front row to the hibachi grill. The inconsistency of the cooks are so ridiculous and argued with me in front of the entire table opposed to talking to me on the side. I spoke to the manager \"Brandon\" behind my husbands back to not upset him but found out my husband had also spoke to \"Brandon\" behind my back to not upset our son. This dinner was his choice for his birthday dinner. Observe two open seats due to poor hosting on both sides of this parent and child during this restaurants \"rush hour\". Please rethink your visit here and make the reservation where it counts and they want your business like Ohjah or Benihana's",

    "text": "If I could give zero stars, I would. We have been to this location three times. We have had seating issues each time at the teppanyaki table but this time took the cake. We called and made a 7:00pm reservation for five for a birthday dinner. We arrived at 6:50pm and was seated literally behind the chef. We said that we would prefer to wait for the next table to open because we were all crunched together behind the chef.   They seated us approximately 15 minutes later and took our orders. They brought the soup, salad and drinks out, with no issues. The chef then comes and starts cooking without any type of introduction of himself at all - no hello, no order confirmation, nothing. The only word he spoke is to ask angrily \"do you want garlic\" as he was making the rice. I'm not sure what his issue was, but he definitely had one. I was appalled since you come to these places for not only the food, but for the show too. I'm assuming that he was upset regarding the seating issue that we had although I really don't understand why he would be upset about that - it really had nothing to do with him.   I have never been so uncomfortable in my life having someone who who was obviously pissed off cooking my meal and slinging bowls of rice at us. The rice literally took 3 minutes to cook (which if anyone is familiar with teppanyaki, they spin the eggs, toss the eggs into the hat, do the heartbeat, etc...) literally NONE of that was done and not a word spoken to us.   It was a very uncomfortable situation, and we actually walked out. We will not return to this location and I am writing this review at Geisha Steakhouse where we have been treated with the utmost of respect and had a very, very nice dinner.   We won't return here and I will tell anyone and everyone I know to stay away.",

Everything in that restaurant is very funny to us.   The floor was kinda sticky when we came in I don't know why but it's funny :D. The HOST person I don't remember his name the \"Chinese/white guy with glasses\" greeted us with a smile and was very nice. Which made us happy so it kinda took our minds off the sticky floor, he was also walking kinda funny.    Our teppan table was great, our server Estuko was very nice and took good care of us. Our chef was funny, polite and cool. He really took care of us.  Overall it was good experience 5/5 we will definitely come back!!! Great job",

Ridiculous. Everyone was done with their meal when he added the lobster to my plate of cold rice and noodles. Fried rice was great though",

We had the white tiger, lobster roll, popcorn lobster, philly express, crunchy roll, avacado roll all with rice paper.  The flavors were delicious, the rolls could have been rolled a little bit tighter.   Staff was attentive, but the serving space was awkward and required a lot of handing over the head.   Wheelchair seating was also not great, it was good for the teppanyaki, but the sushi bar was all higher stools.  The bathroom would have been impossible for a wheelchair.",

    "text": "I really love this place!! I mean this place encompasses everything I look for in a good hibachi place. Its inside of a mall and very easy to find along with lots of abundant parking.  The staff is really sweet and there is no limit of how many people they need to start the grill. If its only one person they will still start the grill. When I was there with my boyfrined they started the gril with just the two of us. When we finished I watched just one guy get cooked for by a chef. I think thats just great.   The food was your typical Hibachi food and was actually pretty! FIlet mignon was soft and rice was served to us in abundance. Unlimited refills on soda and a reasonable price for a glass of wine. The chefs are really into it and they had different tricks I have never seen before at a hibachi restaurant. I really wish this place was not so far from the strip. It is approximately 20 minutes from Mccarran international. It was all in all a great experience. I give it a full strong 5 stars for great service, great interaction with the Hibachi chef and good quality food for value.   Prices are very reasonable and your wallet will smile from the break yuou give it if you have the opportunity to leave the strip.  Decor is standard, nothing specail, but as long as the food quality is good and fresh and staff is friendly decor takes a back seat.  They have this creepy samurai statue when you walk in don't be alarmed. Little couch seating area kept us comfortable as we waited 10 minutes. Bathrooms are clean and they do also have regualr tables where you can just eat sushi and not have hibachi which I did not try.   Great place! Go get some Hibachi!",

It was a good idea because there was NO wait for a table for 2 adults and 2 high chairs, and the entire experience was wonderful!  The service was pretty good.  Our waitress was nice, seemed caring, and she came to check on us throughout the meal.  We had AYCE.  Most of the plates came pretty early and in a short time frame.  There were a few that were spread out, which worked out fine while we enjoyed the earlier dishes.  The ambience was nice, too.  Pretty full restaurant, and we had a view of the teppanyaki stations and all the tricks that the chefs were performing.  Free entertainment!  Now, the food.  I am SO glad that we found this place!!  We're new in town, so I'd been hoping that we would find a go-to sushi/AYCE place.  I think this might be it!  Some of our notable dishes include the Screaming O, the yellowfish sashimi, the Japanese lasagna (baked cali roll with cream cheese on top), softshell crab, spider roll, the Something Wrong roll and the Hold'Em roll. Yum, yum and YUM!  All in all, a very nice Mother's Day meal!  Thank You Samurai Japanese Steakhouse & Sushi!!  See you next time! :)",

So this is not impressive to me at all.  It's slightly better than Panda Express alright, and that's it.   Had teppanyaki here, teriyaki chicken and shrimp combine, and NY steak and salmon combine. Served with steamed rice, fried noodles and broccoli.   When they came, my first thought was, they don't look like teppanyaki at all. This didn't bother me because it could be new style.   Teriyaki chicken was ok, tender, less salty than other Japanese food or Chinese food places (,which was a good thing, teriyaki is not about being salty). Shrimps were a bit hard and dry, a bit less than ok  Beef was in good quality but the cooking didn't quite match. Kinda wasted the steak.   Salmon fillet was alright.  Broccoli was a but too crispy, I personally don't think broccoli is something you eat half raw.   Really the food was not bad, just... they were no more than grilled food. There was no teppanyaki aroma in the store, as for teppanyaki, they didn't make it right.",

The sushi was absolutely delicious and was a fan, but the service needs some serious work.  We waited 10 minutes before our drink order was taken and another 10 mins to receive our drinks.  Once we ordered our food it cam out pretty steady.  And then our waitress disappeared.  We were ready for dessert and the check and waited 30 minutes before we saw here again.  She then came over and asked if we wanted desert and again disappeared for another 15 minutes.  At this point we were ready to go and just wanted our check.  I understand it was  a Friday night but having to wait that long to pay or receive desert is ridiculous.  Will try again because the food was great, just hope they are working on their customer service issues.",

She gave me attitude from the moment I sat down, asked me if I was going to order food and was irritated when I said yes, immediately asked me what I wanted without even offering me a menu so I could see what was available.  She then proceeded to tell me if I was going to order food she'd have to move me to another table, had no regard for the fact I was with 7 other people that were there for a birthday party and wanted me to move to a table to eat alone.  The chef had NO problem adding my order to what he was already cooking, but she had an attitude the entire remainder of the meal, it took me 3 attempts to get her attention just to order an ice water - 20 minutes after I had sat down. I apologized profusely for the inconvenience even though the chef told me to stop apologizing and there was no reason for her to be treating me the way she was.  If the chef is okay adding the order to what he's cooking on the table the waitress should not have an issue.  Chef was amazing, food was amazing and the waitress was awful.  The only reason I tipped was because I didn't have any cash on me to give directly to the chef.  She made me feel like I was an absolute horrible person just for showing up late which was out of my control.",

I must've passed by this place dozens of times when I lived in this area and I never stopped because from the outside it just seemed like it would be below average. My girlfriend finally convinced me to stop in one night and it was so good that we came back again 2 nights later. We had no idea they did teppanyaki! The first time we went, we just decided to get regular dishes- she got sushi and since I hate anything fishy I ordered the Beef Yaki Udon Bento Box. The portion in my box was a very pleasant surprise, and everything in it was delicious--especially the tempura and the salad (and I typically hate Japanese Steakhouse salads). The second time we went, we both got teppanyaki, and for what you get, you can't beat the price. Huge portions, the meat was cooked perfectly (I had the Chicken Teriyaki & Filet Mignon combination), and everything was delicious. The only negative thing was that our second time, the waitress didn't seem interested in serving us at all, so we rarely saw her and when we did, she was a bit standoffish. I give it somewhat of a pass though, because everything on the order was correct and came out relatively promptly. Highly recommend!",

If I'm ever in the area again, I'll go for one of their delicious sushi rolls instead, since that bento box was a little too large for me!

There are better AYCE sushi places for the same price, but if you are nearby and are hankering for some quick sushi action, this place will suffice. If you are a little more discerning and can stand to drive a bit, do so.",

A cheap sushi type of place, not somewhere I'd go if I had a craving for real, quality sushi. But for a quick fix of cheap sushi, I would probably come again.  California roll-- fine and it probably my favorite; it's hard to go wrong with it or mess it up.  Albacore nigiri--definitely had better. Spicy crab roll--pretty much just a california roll but spicy.   They serve tap water, and you can still taste it through the lemon wedge flavor. Personally, I can't tolerate the taste of tap water so I would bring my own if I were to come again.",

I wish they came to check on tables on their own.   the grill food is great.   okay be careful of one thing while sharing because I misunderstood and got charged! if you want to share a meal with someone, they charge you and give you extra sides while splitting the main portion. I don't really like that because I don't want two rices two vegetable sides two salads etc... I wanted to share one meal and eat sushi and have dessert, so that way I could have a little of everything. but yeah they charge you to split so don't split the meal. just order one as is and share when it's prepared to avoid the charge!   helpful tip from restaurant owner and I will definitely go back and get my split now that I know!",

I've already gone here 3 times and have left satisfied all 3 times although I was probably close to falling into a food coma from all the sushi I ate.  I haven't done the teppanyaki here yet, but it is something I'm interested in experiencing. The first time I ate here was for mother's day and we had a pretty good view of the chef when another group was getting it.   I order from their single roll menus. I'm not a huge fan of sashimi so any place that offers a good selection on baked and fried rolls is a winner in my book. However, if you're into sashimi this place does offer that as well. I praise menus that signal out which rolls are raw and which ones are fried and baked. It makes it so easy on picky sushi eaters like myself to enjoy a meal =)  All 3 times I've gone here, I NEVER had to wait for a table. So there's a pretty good chance you won't have to wait for one either. The ambiance is on point as well. I'm a strong believer that when eating sushi I need to be in the right environment. This restaurant offers that.",

We were a party of 5 and got sat at the grill within 5 minutes (around 7:30). That was great because we always have to wait at these type of grills. We all ordered hibachi and I also got a roll (Washington). The roll was nothing to write home about, tasted fine, was kind of falling apart, and I wasn't impressed with the size or amount of fish on it, but it was decent. The hibachi was really good. I got shrimp, my love got steak and shrimp and the kids both got teriyaki chicken kids meals. Our chef was great and really friendly..I didn't get his name but he said he was the head chef and had been there for years. He was really friendly, there was also a younger child at our table who was afraid of the fires so he made them small and kept making sure she was ok with it. I thought that was awesome at how accommodating he was to the other family. He made sure to involve everyone at the table and most important-he made bomb ass food. He also made us a special spicy sauce that was really good. Prices were a little cheaper than hibachis were used to (in Cali) so that was good. Overall I would recommend this place! Good service, good food and a fun atmosphere!",

Well I took today off work and my 6 year old daughter wanted sushi so I thought we would go and sit down. When I arrived I noticed the servers were a bit busy so we waited. About 15 mins had gone by and we were never acknowledged! I told my daughter we would wait 5 more minutes but then I noticed one of the servers sitting behind the bar watching the soccer game! I was so fed up that we walked out and when we did I yelled \"terrible service\" I will never go back here after that although I love their sushi. We ended up going to Momo Sushi on Stephanie and it was pretty dang good! So I recommend not going here unless you want terrible service!",

Sure Goyeman might have more creative specials, and Twister might have faster service, and Island might have better sides, but they also have some big problems too.  Samuri has a wonderful selection of no rice options (lovely wrap, stuffed tomato, poke salad, screaming o, and 3 or 4 types of sashimi), great chefs that will customize for you, fast service (if you are the bar), and a pretty wide selection of nigiri, and a good selection of rolls that aren't all based on a california roll.    Plus the restaurant is spacious, so you never feel crowded, and we've never had to wait for a table.    Last two things, they don't do a stamp card but their prices are a buck or two cheaper than the places that do, so it evens out.  And they are currently running a special of 50% off all sushi, so if you aren't that hungry this is another good option.  Only bad side, they keep the restaurant on the cold side because of the teppanyaki tables, so you may want to bring a jacket...",

They have choice regular dining, but I thought kids would love the chef cooking in front of us,  they did! We all had so much fun drinking, eating, with fun entertainment! The sushi was very affordable and delicious! The only reason why I didn't give 5 stars: When I made the reservation they told me they would sing happy bday, cook special something for my husband, and bring slice of cheesecake. This didn't happen, they must have forgot. The only way I could've made this special experience special for my husband was to get up to talk to waiter. I didn't do that. This was the only disappointing thing about this place. Food and experience was one to come back to!",

We cancelled the last dish and got our bill.  The waitress was not the least bit worried about all of us waiting for the rest of the food to arrive, and being polite, not eating our meal.  She still get paid right?  The food was also a little disappointing.  The rolls we ordered were not as round as your thumb.  With 6 of them packed together it took up about 2\" x 2\" of space on the plate.  Quality and taste was a little below average.  No guessing that we are not returning.  But mainly because of the horrible service and lack of concern.",

The menu has a lot of selection also considering it's all you can eat ! We had an awesome experience . I would have gave a 5 but my son ordered the chicken Katsu off the menu and it wasn't good . I think their specialty is the sushi and the entertainment when they cook in front of you !!",

I called back to confirm the reservation once more because i thought she said Friday. She confirmed thursday and hung up again sounding extremely annoyed that i called back.  We showed up today at 6:58 and were told we had no table because our reservation was for Friday. I could clearly see the reservation on Friday, even after i called back to confirm. We were then told they had no open tables. So we left.  I'd likely never return. The man we spoke with tonight had nothing to say except that i made the wrong reservation. Terrible customer service.

    "text": "I went to my trusty Yelp app looking for some good sushi. After having intestinal surgery 3 months ago, I was ecstatic when I finally got the okay to eat sushi, as the craving had intensified while I couldn't have it. Of course, right?! Although I live in California, I come to Vegas 2-3 times per month. This city is literally a second home for me. I like to find regular places that I can go to that have consistently good food and service. I'll be honest, the proximity to the hotel is what made me choose Samurai; that and the decent reviews. Many of the photos were two to three years old or more. Not seeing recent photos was a concern, especially since the page is owned/claimed by the owner, Freddy. He could post some recent pics of the food, the restaurant, the guests... I hope he does. Seeing recent pictures definitely helps many people, myself included to decide on if I want to stop in or not.   I read the review posted by Sera and I was a little surprised by it. I agree that there were kids in there when I went in, myself. However, how those kids behaved had nothing to do with the establishment and everything to do with the shitty parenting. For example, On my first visit, I ordered take out and waited up front. This kid who had to be maybe five or six kept running up to the front and he'd sit on the bench right by the front door and play with his toy. His parents took their sweet ass time coming to check on him. This kid must have run back and forth five times. He could have gone right out the front door or someone could have taken him. Regardless, to me, it didn't reflect on the restaurant. Secondly, not having a hostess standing up there was no big deal for me. I figure at busier times, someone is at the front desk, which rang True when we walked in for dinner the other night. The restaurant was nicer than I thought, after reading her review. I really expected to walk into a rinky dink and this place was nothing like that.   When I did walk in for lunch on my first visit, it only took maybe 2 minutes for Andrew to walk up and greet me. He was really pleasant when I arrived, and patiently waited as I perused the menu for my to go order; even asking me what I had a taste for, so he could help me narrow down the choices in the menu.  I asked to speak to Freddy, the owner. He said that he wasn't there at the moment and asked if anything was wrong. I told him that nothing was wrong, but that the bad review that was written made me want to come in, rather than prevent me from doing so. I felt like one star was a bit much when the other reviewer stated that she walked in and out, since no one was up front and there was too many kids. I was surprised that she never tried the food. It sounded like from her review that she never had any interaction with anyone. But she's definitely entitled to her opinion. Hope she tries it again, because both their food and customer service is excellent! That, I did not expect.   That day at lunch, I ordered three rolls; a Lobster Roll, a Crunch Roll, and a Spicy Tuna Roll. I honestly didn't expect much. I thought it would just be average, but these rolls were fucking good! That Crunch Roll has got to be the best that I've ever tried! And that Lobster Roll......OMG!! All three were delicious!! When I got back to the hotel, I shared my new treasures with my group and everyone loved them equally as much as I did.   Fast forward to the other night, we all decided to go for a Teppanyaki dinner. We have enjoyed Teppanyaki since we took a cruise and they had it. This is where they cook on an open grill for you. Peter was our chef and he was fantastic! He had a great sense of humor, the food was delicious, and we had a great time.  The dinners are priced reasonably and you get a lot of food. The rice was probably my favorite, but I wished he would have seasoned it a lot better. However, I know they keep it neutral for everyone's palate. The shrimp was super flavorful and big and the steak was tender and equally as flavorful! Someone else in our group got lobster and chicken and all of it was delicious, tender, and we had big portions. We ended up taking the rest of our food to go, because we were damn near in a food coma. We will for sure be back! Andrew and Peter were excellent and so was the food and the vibe!",

Highly disappointed in how customer service doesn't seem to be a top pillar for this kind of establishment.  The host told us it would be an hour wait for teppan table seating for 2!! Just because they did not want to open another table! I think that's pretty ridiculous.  I'm not sure what happened to this place or why the employees just don't seem to care but obviously this place needs some new form of management or customer service refresher course or you'll keep losing customers.  It's almost like playing Russian roulette every time I'd return,  hoping it'd get better but it didn't.  Sorry samurai, because of your crap service we will go to outback steakhouse now.  Thanks!",

However, if your just looking for a couple of rolls and don't feel like stuffing your face until you tap out, they have been offering a 50% all rolls and nigiri for quite some time now.   Of the last few times I have been, the service has been on par and the food is pretty good. I mean you do get what you pay for, but I think here, you get a little more bang for your buck compared to many other sushi restaurants in town. I don't have any particular rolls that stand out in my mind as amazing, you must try these when you are here, but I am a huge fan of the cajun albacore and garlic ahi.",

    "text": "******EDIT SEE BELOW*********  We had this place for the first time today and first off, no one is in the front to greet you, you had to wait for someone to come up and that took a few minutes, then she was somewhat rude and since there were two parties that came in together she seated us at the same time, maybe because she felt that she was too busy to seat each party by one??  It took a while to get someone over to even get us water and they didn't give us a regular menu, just a sushi menu. My husband isn't a huge sushi fan so we had to wait for seriously 10 minutes for the waiter to even come over for us to order, and by the we weren't fully prepared because we needed a regular menu. So I decided to order my sushi.  Finally after twenty or so minutes my husband was all ready to order, but then my sushi came out WAY before his food even arrived. My sushi was OK, not great like I've had at other places.   My husband's FINALLY came out after what it seemed like an eternity and it was HUGE, not complaining at all about the amount of food they give you in your bento boxes, but it wasn't good at all and he ordered the beefyaki bento and got like THREE TINY pieces of meat. Rice seemed old as well and he didn't really eat much of anything else except the noodles and beef.   All in all, I am disappointed because I saw these other reviews and thought it would have been A LOT better. Maybe because we didn't do the grill because they seemed to get spectacular service.  *****edit*****  I decided to change my review due to the fact that the owner just emailed me due to our experience. He really does care and I do believe in giving businesses second chances. Thank you again Freddy for your concern about our dining experience!",

    "text": "We went here to celebrate my daughters 14th birthday. (December 3rd around 6:30pm) We waited about 45 minutes for a table at the grill because she had never been to a Japanese steakhouse before. My husband and I have frequented them for years so we were excited to share the experience. Well, our chef spent the entire time talking to a couple at the table who were regulars. Even after telling him it was our daughters birthday he spoke maybe 10 words to us, didn't \"perform\" like the other chefs and made extremely inappropriate jokes at the other couple in front of my child and her friend. On the plus side, the food was amazing and the other staff were absolutely awesome.  The sushi we ordered was extremely small for the price, we are used to getting triple the amount of sushi for the price, but it was very good. We spent $200 there and were very dissappointed with the ambience. Also. The bathrooms were unclean and missing paper towels. And while waiting they stuck is in a small corner between the bathroom and the bar and forgot about us.  We were the only people on the list yet watched 5 other families be seated before us. I wish I could give it more stars because the food was really good, but the whole night was just dissappointing. It kind of ended the night on a bad note.",

You can get a meal with steak, fish, fried rice, noodles, a few rolls, salad, soup, etc, for about 14 to 20$$ and it is a really good meal the will fill you up. You can also get sushi, it's reasonable priced. You can get all can eat for I think about $26 or about $23 for lunch. The sushi is amazing. Only one place has better sushi in my opinion and that is Yama. The staff here are very frigidly and nice. It's a really fun environment.",

    "text": "I've frequented this establishment about 6 times in the past year and always have a good experience. The staff is always adequate and friendly. The restaurant is very spacious,  clean, and just plain nice. They have the tepenyanki grills and also serve sushi with similar appetizers you'd find at any AYCE sushi joint.  This review is for the sushi part of the menu.  Sometimes you crave sushi but don't want to bust your gut \"eating your monies worth\" of unlimited sushi and appetizers for AYCE. Well if you order two special rolls off of a sushi menu the total usually comes out to how much sitting down and getting AYCE sushi for dinner ($25-$30).  Well here comes this place.  The whole menu is \"half price\" meaning everything is $3-$8 dollars. That means getting a couple rolls of sushi for a light lunch or dinner with tip could easily be $10-$15 which wouldn't force you to get all you can eat for the sake of \"well it's just a few bucks more.\"  They have a great selection of special rolls.   I don't remember any ones in particular EXCEPT the monkey brain. It's four banana slices that are topped with spicy crab and sauce. The combination is really good and unique. Also the white tiger which is a shrimp tempura roll topped with white fish and sauce.   We usually go for light dinner before a movie but went recently for AYCE for a birthday and it was good. Their fried appetizers aren't the best. They are too heavy. Tempura is usually more light. I'd say stick away from the calamari or soft shell crab. The food was still good but the fried stuff wasn't so good. I got to try some of the nigiri and it they were good.   Their uni here was really good though! I believe the places that have a one per person limit on uni and ebi get the good stuff. They have that 1PP limit on it and it was sweet and not fishy. Their cake albacore was also really good.  Overall I like this place. It's a solid four overall when you incorporate the value, staff, and ambience.   I don't recommend it for AYCE. For the price I'd for sure go to GOEYMON, sushi twister, Oyshi, or sushi mon.   This is like a safe restaurant to introduce to people who've never had sushi.   This wouldn't be for a person who is a sushi expert.",

I ordered a spicy tuna hand roll and received a cut roll...  The food was also terrible. They put lemon on everything and put sesame seeds in everything.   Also the guy cooking our food wasn't that great and didn't really put on a good show.   I do not recommend you eat here. It is cheap but really crappy!!!",

We didn't know what to expect so gave it a shot...  We tried the rainbow roll, crunch spicy tuna, and another roll with a sweet sauce on top. Each roll was delicious - but nothing to 'brag' about...  The green tea mochi was pretty delicious as a dessert!  I wasn't too impressed with the cleanliness of the restaurant...it's rating made me have another expectation of the place and when I went to use the restroom it was in pretty bad shape...a restaurant definitely isn't just based on food alone.",

They spent more time waiting for their order than actually eating. The time limit for all you can eat sushi is an hour we were there for an hour and a half. Another server was very rude. She came to our table and demanded that we give her the all you can eats menus even though four people in our party were still eating. She also insisted that we hand her the empty plates on the table instead of reaching for the plates. Sushi eating participants stated the the quality of the sushi was mediocre. Our server tried her very best and was nice but the server that asked for the menus was extremely rude and should not work in customer service.",

I wish I could remember his name!   We made a reservation for the Teppanyaki Grilll, which I highly recommend. We had a party of 7. We started with some Asahi beer. You have enough time to chat & enjoy your company before the chef starts your grilling entertainment.   My kids loved it! My daughter is 14, & she said it was really cool to watch the chef prepare her meal in front of her.  I had the scallops, which were moist and cooked to perfection...not chewy. I ordered the NY steak med.well. It was delicious! No fat on it, tender and full of flavor...I didn't even need a knife to trim it!   They also served a bowl of soup, I don't know what it's called\" but it is a broth base with some green onions in it and fresh sliced mushrooms. After that comes a small salad with a ginger dressing, followed by stir fried rice.  The chef does a great show with the eggs for the rice! Just charming.  The noodles have a slightly sweet flavor to them and the vegetables were crisp.   Everything has been excellent here twice within the last month. I hope they keep up the good service and the food quality.",

What was his name????? He was Mexican........he said so, from Texas. He had so many cool tricks beyond the volcano, etc. anyway, the food, all fresh, cooked perfectly, tasty, and awesome. We had 2 full entrees with steak and seafood, 4 drinks, 2 different orders of sushi and it was unbelievably inexpensive for all that we had. Cindy and the Chef were people we cannot wait to see when we come back, again, and again....Great place, great food, great restaurant!",

There were 3 other tables with 2-3 people per table,  and maybe 5 people at the bar.  It was not busy at all.

It took so long and they came out so far apart we honestly didn't even remember what we ordered anymore. We got tired of waiting and asked for the bill. A good amount of time had passed after we paid and they brought out another roll. We picked at and were standing up about to leave when 2 more came. No one apologized for the slow shitty service. Yama sushi is always packed and we still get served faster than this place.",

Unless you're truly planning to put down half the menu, or you're only ordering nigiri, a la carte is your best option for sushi.  There's a good variety of fresh, baked, and shrimp tempura rolls. Unlike most AYCE spots, they're pretty light on sauces here and some rolls are pretty basic. Between a friend and I, we ordered 4 rolls to share. Three were tiny, and one was normally-sized, unclear why. Fish was fresh, and portions were such that adding on a soup and salad made for a complete meal under $20, which isn't bad at all. Their sushi isn't necessarily the best, but it's a great deal!",

    "text": "Actual zero star experience as far as hibachi goes.   **THEY DO NOT ACKNOWLEDGE FOOD ALLERGIES***  The chef had a terrible attitude the whole dinner. My party didn't have kids and he catered to the party that did have kids. They got their food first, they got bigger portions, they got all the gimmicks that makes this type of dining enjoyable.   One in our party is vegan. We asked for extra tofu. He said no. It's only an appetizer.   I cannot have shrimp. Ive never been here before but most hibachi places ask you if anyone has allergies or separate the meat. This guy started cooking the shrimp. I figured he'd use a different section for my chicken. I asked him if he could cook the chicken separately because I have an allergy. He yelled at my mother stating she should have told him before he started cooking. Blamed me and my mother for not telling him how to do his job.   The manager was useless. My family has been here before and allergies were considered. The manager said it's not their job to ask about allergies. Ok cool I'm sure it'll be your problem when you get sued.   To top it off everyone has finished eating. My chicken is nowhere to be found. The noodles were garbage and sweet. The veggies were dry. But nothing left a worst taste in my mouth than watching my mother get insulted.  I just got my chicken fresh from the back of the kitchen. \"I made this just for you.\" I'm trying REALLY hard to believe this guy didn't spit in my food but my experience with food service says otherwise.   Don't blame the customer for your failures and shortcomings. Give adequate attention to all patrons. I hope the family of four children leave a decent tip because we won't.",

    "text": "First of, I don't usually give a three stars review unless I have to.  We went to Las Vegas for a family vacation and since this restaurant was technically within the same block as our hotel, we were like, hey why not try? Plus I saw the reviews that this place is a kid friendly restaurant.  Came here around 5 pm? I forgot exactly when but the place was not packed! The hostess asked us if we want to sit by the teppan or regular table and we instantly asked for regular table because we have three toddlers.  First impression when we walked to the table. The floor was sticky! It was so yucky but we thought since we are already here, we should just eat. I mean, bringing hungry toddlers out from a restaurant is like looking to start a war.   Menu was big. We got confused because apparently they have a half off price going on and the server or the hostess didn't even mention it to us so we had to ask.  The portion was big though. I ordered beef teriyaki bento box and chicken katsu bento box for my kids. And since my kids don't eat that much, I was able to share it with the grandma. We did order extra cucumber roll and California roll. This foods were able to feed 2 adults and three toddlers.  My husband ordered 3 rolls and I another entree but I forgot what. Lol. Sorry I was paying attention to my kids more than anything. Again, no complaints here about the foods.   My dad has a chirashi bowl. It was actually decent since they cut the fish thick. I mean compare to Chicago where everything is super cheap. Lol. However, I am not sure why they put the chirashi in like a regular plate and not like in a proper bowl. I do know this because my dad is a Japanese. Again, we did not complain or anything because the food taste good.  So yeah three stars because of the food taste and the portion. I had to take two stars because of the cleanliness. Will go here again if we ever in the area.",

The service was painfully slow, and we had to wait a while for our food after we put in our order and the restaurant wasn't even very busy. We opted for the $26.95 dinner option for lunch because it included uni, and sweet shrimp 1 order per person. For our first round, we ordered mostly sushi, the rice to fish ratio is not great. The slice of fish is pretty thin over a normal to slightly large piece of rice. Compared to other AYCE sushi places in town, the ratio could use some improvement. The sashimi plate also had very thin slices of fish.   The service was not only slow but pretty absent, my drinks were not refilled, our server only came to our table when she delivered our food but never came back to check on us or if we needed anything else. We had to flag her down several time just for more wasabi.   Overall a pretty mediocre place.",

I came here on a double date with my husband and his parents, we brought our 7 month old baby, they had a high chair ready at the teppanyaki table for us when we were being seated.  Once we ordered, my sushi came out very quickly, I got a Samurai Spicy Yellowtail Roll and an Orange Crush roll (my favourite roll). I have never had an orange crush that tasted so good, I'm not even exaggerating. The samurai spicy yellowtail wasn't spicy enough for me, but that's a matter of taste, it was still delicious either way.   When the teppan chef came out, he added extra touches to the dinner show specifically for my baby, he brought out toys and interacted with my baby, my son was loving it!!   The teppanyaki we got was beyond amazing, we got sea bass, chicken, steak, and shrimp. I urge everyone to spend the little bit extra for the sea bass, it was tender, juicy, and the garlic soy lemon butter topping was amazing, I want it on everything!   I asked for one final order, I wanted salmon egg nigiri and quail egg nigiri. The sushi chef said he wanted to make me something special, so he made salmon egg nigiri and topped it with quail egg, and gave me an order or 4 pieces, instead of 2 pieces of each, IT WAS SO GOOD!!!   I regret not getting photos, I was preoccupied with my son, but I loved every second of this place and will be returning very soon.",

Sushi chefs Bass, from Thailand, and Jesse, American born Japanese, are excellent roll makers, and can be creative should you request one of their specialties... Waitresses Gizzel, hispanic, and Juu, Thailand, are very attentive to your needs...   For an AYCE, the quality of the sushi is quite good... Bass and Jesse do not overload with the rice, and you receive a generous portion compared to most AYCE places... Appetizers from the back kitchen seem to be half size vs a'la carte, so simply make the pork belly, scallops, and soft shell crab a double order... Samurai has lobster rolls too... My norm is popcorn lobster on yum yum roll...   Atmosphere is ok... You get used to the table chefs train whistle, fire ball flame ups, and mostly poor melodies of \"happy birthday \" sung by customers...  Samurai is a really good place, overall...   Check please...!!",

    "text": "I have been to Samurai Japanese Steakhouse and Sushi several times and really like this place. Of course, Japanese Hibachi places are not on every corner in Henderson, but this one is worth going to. I would recommend calling ahead and getting reservations as they do get busy/ full at the hibachi tables.   On my last visit I got the NY Steak, but usually get the filet mignon and chicken teppanyaki. They cook to order, so they always do no onions for my husband and me. My husband's vegan cousin came here with us once, and they left out certain ingredients for her that were animal based. The food is always great. They messed up an appetizer once and not only did they fix it, but they took it off the bill.   There are certain hibachi chefs that I like better than others, but I'm horrible with names. Once guy made us his \"secret sauce\" and it was so good.  The price is decent at about $20+ per person, depending on what you get. Getting the filet mignon is $3 more, but worth it.   Also, if you go for sushi, they have great rolls. My husband is more of the sushi one, but I get the California roll every time I go. It is so good compared to other places and is only about $4 or so.  Overall, I highly recommend this place for their food and service. A previous review said the floor was very sticky, which was True. It was very funky. When we went last week, it had been corrected. Hopefully it stays that way. I've only had great service there, but everyone has their own experiences for sure.",

I ordered green tea, hubby ordered iced tea, and pops ordered soda. So our total was $95.01 after taxes.  If we go back again, we won't order everything at once. We've never been there before and ordered a bunch of stuff at once. They all came pretty much one right after the other and filled up our table. So only order a few rolls at a time unlike us.

She was very friendly up until my trying to figure out that last roll I wanted to order (trying to figure out what it was but didn't in the end). The fried ice cream was pretty good.

I said it was okay and that I was willing to wait, so we waited about 15-20 minutes.  The restaurant itself is huge and also offers a la carte dining including AYCE sushi options. The a la carte sushi prices are quite competitive too, advertised as always half price.  As for the teppanyaki itself, it was fairly standard fare. Our chef was friendly and tried to make conversation even though our table/party consisted of only two people. We were served ginger-based and mayonnaise-based dipping sauces; occasionally I also see a horseradish-based sauce at some places but not here.  The other thing that stood out to me was that everyone got a shrimp appetizer even though it was only lunch, and that everyone also gets a portion of yakisoba (noodles). I have never had noodles automatically served, but this was also my first teppanyaki experience in Vegas (if this is the norm here, I have had countless teppanyaki meals in my lifetime). Though the noodles were tasty, instead of more carbs, I would have preferred the bean sprouts that some other places serve.  Nonetheless, the food was tasty and I really have no complaints about the teppanyaki experience. I wouldn't mind coming back to try their non-teppanyaki menu as well.",

We went here last week and just told the sushi chef that I like everything but crab and eel. He made us 3 rolls. I don't know what was in them, and I have the slightest clue what he said but as usual it was good.   We love spicy anything, We do know that their \"Fire Roll\", \"What the Heck\", and \"911\" rolls suit our fancy.   The service is great despite the lack of english. our server kept calling me \"Sexy lady\".. I  loved her immediately... who wouldn't? =-)  I recommend this place to anyone who is in the area that is looking for a non fast food but FAST lunch.",

    "text": "This is my favorite sushi place in Las Vegas. By far.   First, the atmosphere. It is a large standalone building amongst small stripmalls, so it feels like your going into someplace special, and you really are. The place is great for dinner on a Friday night. There's a large bar, three teppanyaki stations, and a large sushi bar as well. It's very entertaining setting! I much appreciate variety in music at restaurants, and they have a nice pandora mix playing usually.   The sushi! My gosh, THE SUSHI. The best I've had in the Las Vegas area. It's my second favorite sushi place over all, only to Blue Nami sushi in Folsom, CA. I moved to Vegas when I was young and have struggled to find a sushi place that compared to Blue Nami, but this one blew me away. The fish melts in your mouth, it's so fresh. The sizes of rolls are perfect, and their unique variety is refreshing. They have at least 35 house rolls. I've tried most. All were delicious.   The ONLY THING that gives this place a 4 star instead of 5 is the service. I love all the servers there, they are kind and outgoing, and the teppanyaki chefs have wonderful talent and are great performers! But, the service speed and attentiveness is spuratic. Some nights, it's perfect, the best I've ever had. Other times, if it's really busy or something maybe, it's slow and unattentive. We will give our drink order and not see the waiter/waitress for another 30 min. Or I'll ask for a refill 2-3 times. Those nights, the food takes forever to get out of the kitchen. And it's rarely all dishes at the same time.   Besides the occasional service slip, this is a 5 star restaurant. It's my favorite, and my regular spot and the only sushi place I'll eat at now. DELICIOUS. Try this place, you won't regret it. (:",

    "text": "Today was craving Salmon or Tilapia for lunch.  Was in the area and I see the sign \"50% Suishi\".  Well, that got me and decided to stop here.  Let's start with the staff...all pretty good.  Only issue I had is when I first got here.  The place wasn't busy at all and they told me to sit anywhere.  The first place I chose, they told me to move.  The second seat I chose, they still told me to move.  I guess it's sit where you like except here, here, here, or here. Finally seated in a little corner/cubby type area.  They wanted me close to the sushi chef.   Let's look at the price.  AYCE is about $20 for lunch, which is average to everyone other Sushi Restaurant out here.  If you are getting just one or two rolls, it's cheaper to get their 50% off sushi.  I have to admit, their 50% sushi is cheap.  One of trhe cheapest I've seen in town.  Reviewed the menu and decided on 3 different rolls and some calamari.  Did the math and it was cheaper if I got the AYCE.  My Complaints:  Bottom line, you get what you pay for.   -Calamari:  It was a full serving.  I expected your typical tiny fried calamari that you find at sushi restaurants.  But it was so greasy that I thought I was eating onion rings. The calamari was also served with sweet and sour sauce, which I was not use to.   -Sushi:  Had the Spider Roll, Red Rock, and Tiger Roll.  I was a bit disappointed.  All rolls were loose and all had more rice than substance.  I don't know about you, but sushi shouldn't be eaten with a spoon.  The rolls would break at the slight touch, that you had no choice but to use a spoon/fork.  You know the rolls are loose when it's even served to you broken up. Taste wasn't the best either. Not sure if it was not fresh or was it due to me having better in other places.   -Dessert:  Wanted the Fried Vanilla Ice Cream, but the place was out of vanilla ice cream.  C'mon man.    I did not have a great experience here. But I will still try them at least one more time. Looking at the menu, their steaks look good and are pricey.  The Tepan Yaki looks to be their specialty.  This review may not be a fair one since I had not tried these.  If my experience changes, then I will change my review.",

We've had numerous chefs and you can tell that the restaurant has a specific flavoring, but each chef does seem to cater it slightly to his tastes. We had Kong today and he was great. His fried rice was awesome!    If going on a weekend afternoon or evening, or a holiday, I'd highly recommend reservations!   We've always say at one of the grilles and never at a table or at the bar, so I can't speak as to how the service is in those areas. But at the grilles, the service is awesome. Out of all the times we've been, I can recall only one time when the service was not up to their standards, and looking back, that weekend they about 15 people out the door waiting for a grille. They were SUPER busy that time.   Just an FYI, if you tell them it's your birthday, they will make a production out of it, literally. They will play a birthday song over the PA, and one of the lady's, Cindy, will come to the center of the grille and do a birthday dance for you (it's a clean, family friendly dance)  In short, go, eat, enjoy. Youll be glad you did!",

I was pleasently surprised to see a few tepenyaki chefs working their magic. I should have chosen to sit and enjoy the show. I wanted a more intimate experience with my gf so we decided to get a table. We were sat at a high back booth and it was private, exactly what I was looking for. We started with Gyoza and spring rolls. Not too pleased. 2 super tiny spring rolls for a high price. We also ordered 3 rolls of sushi to accompany. Our appetizers showed up quickly and then 40 minutes later still no sushi. I then ordered 2 more rolls that never showed up until I had to flag down my server. My original 3 rolls never arrived but the 2 I ordered afterwards finally arrived after speaking with my server. We spent an hour and a half waiting and left unsatisfied and hungry. By the time we were \"finished\" the restaurant was almost empty...I don't understand how you can forget 5 rolls of sushi...C'mon! I will try this place again. But this time maybe not stuck in a corner. We will try the sushi bar or will sit with the tepenyaki chef. It seemed everyone else was well taken care of. 1 star",

The water was disgusting. Tasted unfiltered and there was little pieces of gunk in the water. The worst part is, the waitress knew it was disgusting water, but she decided to serve it anyway. After they served us the Badwater they took it back and gave us bottled water and said that the water was bad the end of the dinner tried to charges three dollars a bottle for the water we refused to pay and argue with the manager to get it removed off the bill the fan didn't work above where they were cooking so we are in a constant smokestack. The cook was a old Chinese man who kept dropping his knifes and cooked everything at the same time and burn the eggs and the fried rice it was disgusting but after our $48 dinner I decided I wouldn't go there again.  By the way if you decide to eat there ask for the Mexican chefs they cook the best and give you the Best show.",

I sometimes did the half price sushi (even takeout!)  if I didn't have the room for AYCE.  On this recent visit, the half-price sign was gone from the front but I went in anyway.  Turns out they still have this special going on.  Anyway, once seated (at about 2:45), I asked to do the AYCE and was given the dinner price of 26.95 each!  REALLY?!  No way...not here.  I did the half off and was rather disappointed with the size of the rolls.  The taste was OK but something was lacking.  I do like their deep-fried rolls (why doesnt Island Sushi make those?!) and the garlic tuna and cajun albacore were pretty tasty.  The specialty rolls were a miss for me.  The gal who was our server seemed to have an attitude.  Now I am NOT one of those who treat anyone badly....in fact, just the opposite.  I believe that you get back what you give out.  This gal had a chip on her shoulder and she was in a mood...with all the other tables nearby.  I will say that others in the restaurant were VERY friendly.  For about the same price, I will stick with ISLAND SUSHI which is a FANTASTIC place.",

I had the sushi bridge, and it was so neat, a little wooden bridge on a platter filled with some of the freshest rolls around, tuna, unagi, tobiko, and nigiri...For lunch we always get the bento box, which is a STEAL for 8.95. You get miso soup, salad, crab rolls, pork katsu (or salmon or beef), gyoza dumplings, and tempura shrimp and vegetables!  Rolls are always half off so we get a nice plate of spicy tuna to go with that bento box.  Oh, and the service can be a bit spotty at times, but no big deal.  Every server we've ever had there has been great to us, even if they were a little slow.  So, I recommend this place to anyone wanting some nice, fresh sushi or rolls.  I love Fukuda (Err, I mean Samurai), and hope you will too! Sayonara!!",

Me and my girlfriend have been coming here close to a year now and the servers recognize us all the time and are always upset when we don't come in together.   They make us feel at home.  They're always on top of their attentiveness.   They come by often to check how we are doing and see if we need a refill or anymore sushi.   Perfect thing is it isn't too often so we can actually have a conversation without being interrupted every couple of minutes.  The best thing about this place is their half off deals on almost everything.  It's definitely worth the 4-6 dollars for 8 rolls per dish.  Music isn't overwhelmingly loud, just right.  We are always going to be coming back to this spot.  They also half the center catering people that make the food right in front of you in the center of their building,   so right when you walk in you're mesmerized about how awesome these people are,  very impressive with their showings while they cook,  and they also incorporate a little comedy act every time they cook.  Overall great place.  We'll always be coming back.  The food,  servers, and service is just great for what you are paying for.",

    "text": "Went there tonight 11/9/15 for dinner at 730pm.  Showed up early and was greeted by a very friendly host.  He gave us menus to look over while we waited for our hibachi table.  My daughter and husband had never been to a teppenyaki restaurant before and did not know what to expect at all.  I had never been to this restaurant before.  We are seated quickly and did notice that the plates were slightly soiled, but not anything major.  The grill area was clean.  We ordered two adult teppenyaki meals and 1 child teppenyaki meal, plus one sushi roll, an order of strawberry mochi, and 2 soft drinks.  Our server was quick and courteous and always seemed to fill the drinks at the perfect time.  The teppenyaki chef was funny, easy going, and put on quite a show for my daughter's and husband's first experience!  My family and I are not light eaters - but the portion sizes were enormous!  Standard teppenyaki comes with soup, salad, a huge mound of rice, 2 pcs of medium sized shrimp, a big portion of noodles, a nice size amount of vegetables, plus whatever meats you ordered.  Our daughter's meal was easily enough for 2 light eaters. All in all, we well be back again.  The sushi was delicious and we would come back for that alone.  All sushi was 50% off, which I gather is the norm. It all left a good impression and was reasonable.  Our bill was $109. We left 20%.  Next time, I'll be sure to bring extra cash for the teppenyaki chef!",

The chef finally came out, didn't  say hello, and when we tried to order something after 10 mins of waiting he yelled \"first come, first serve, you wait!!!\". It was the single rudest experience I've ever had.... After getting our sushi 20 mins later, which was made by a sous chef who didn't even know what a scallop hand-roll was we were given a roll without half the ingredients the menu stated it to have.  They didn't even apologize or warn us what we were actually receiving and the scollop hand- rolls had maybe 2 scallops finely minced and mixed with imitation crab which is what the cut rolls was filled with instead of the fresh fish we actually ordered.  I joined yelp just to write this review, that's how bad our experience was... Horrible service, horrible sushi and it wasn't even cheap.... Never go to this restaurant you will be severely disappointed and leave insulted!!!  If there was a negative amount of stars I could give, I would!",

    "text": "There's some things about Samurai that I love and some things that I don't particularly like....however the good outweighs the bad in my case.  Pros:  *Half-off sushi- good quality fish/product, yummy roll combos and easy on your wallet *Chefs- we request Big John by name. He's funny, energetic and puts on a good show. If we can't get Big John then we ask for Kevin. *HIbachi- we only eat at the teppan table when we dine in. The filet mignon is awesome and oh so juicy, the chicken is tender and not overcooked and their \"pink seafood sauce\"...well, I dip everything in it :) *Hours- open for lunch and late at night so I can come in right at noon for lunch or eat a late 10pm dinner. It's convenient!   Cons: *Cleanliness- the bathrooms here drive me bananas. They are dirty and have trash everywhere. The rest of the restaurant is pretty decent.  *Pricing- hibachi is kinda pricy; the filet mignon meal is $24.95, I can go to Ta-Ta's down the street and get the same quality of meat for $14.95. I keep coming back because of the relationship I have formed with the chefs.  *Chefs- if I don't get Big John or Kevin as my hibachi chefs then it seems like the quality of my meal diminishes. For example: when I order my usual meal they give me fatty scraps of filet and they don't listen to how I liked my meal prepared (aka light pepper, no garlic, real butter, etc). *AYCE sushi- you can only get AYCE sushi at the sushi bar or at the dining room tables. You cannot get it at the hibachi tables which I think is ridiculous.",

    "text": "Fast and cheap. I'm a big fan of Japanese food so I'm pretty harsh when it comes to quality.    The place was pretty empty when we came in. The hostess could have been a bit friendlier when she was trying to seat us especially since there was only another small party before us. She tried seating is at the same time which is weird since we were in no rush.  We ended up ordering a spider roll (my favorite) and a dragon roll (one of my boyfriend's favorites) and one teriyaki bento.   The rolls arrived quickly but they were on the small side. I'm not sure if it was because we asked for no avocado (due to a food allergy my boyfriend has) or because of the price of the rolls (which are pretty cheap). The bento box was pretty generous though when it came to portions but lacked flavor in the chicken and the dressing for the salad.  Overall, if you want quick and cheap food this would be the place for you but don't be surprised if your food is lacking in the flavor department.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I come here quite often because it's close to our house, affordable, and has good food and service. We have never done AYCE because we could never ear that much. Having said that, there are a few rolls that we consistently order here: the shrimp tempura roll, sunset roll, and lisa lisa. If you are looking for traditional rolls, however, this is where they lose half a point for me, but due to the other good factors, I'm rounding up to a 5 star rating.   We also like their bento boxes. I love their beef teriyaki box. The beef is legitimate steak cubes, and the flavor is not too sweet. My boyfriend likes the yaki udon and I always steal a few bites from him when he orders it because it is pretty authentic tasting. The bento boxes all come with an assortment of tempura, gyoza, California rolls, salad, and rice. It is a great deal for the price and I always have basically an extra meal to take home for the next day.   We have done the teppanyaki once. I really liked it. Honestly, I don't care much about the entertainment factor because I just love the flavor of teppanyaki but I thought the chef did a good job engaging my boyfriend and I and the other family at the table with us. My boyfriend was less impressed, but we aren't sure yet if it's because he doesn't like teppanyaki or if it's because he didn't care for their teppanyaki.   The service is always friendly and engaging. We have always been greeted with a smile and we truly do enjoy this restaurant. Whenever we are looking for a meal on the way home, Samurai consistently pops up as one of a select few \"go to\" places.",

I could never take my Japanese mother-in-law here, she would find the food very distasteful.  If I wasn't a cultured person, I would find the food and experience great... however I was disappointed in the cost versus the quality.

This price does not justify the amount of sushi you need to eat to get your money's worth. You basically have to order over 5 rolls to pay what the all you can eat price is. That seems like A LOT of sushi....and it is!   I ended up ordering two all you can eat. I liked it but I had to end up paying over (full price) for the rolls I didn't eat. I understand this rule is necessary so that people don't over order. I wish they had the option to order a half roll instead of a full one. I like to order variety and with the all you can eat option is not really possible unless you eat a lot and are ok with paying for the leftovers.   Overall I think I would visit again...but I would not get the all you can eat option. Their regular prices are great and if you don't eat a lot of sushi this is a great affordable restaurant to come.",

When we walked in we were greeted immediately and we were sat down right away.  Waiter was good and prompt in getting us our drinks and taking our order. Food came out quickly and tasted great.  My reasoning behind the 3/5 stars is I wish they had half order of rolls. I would like to have more of a variety when I'm ordering and the best way to do that is with half rolls. I would have given this place a 4/5 stars because of that.   Now the reason for only 3 stars is because our server had gone on break (which is fine, we all need a break) but the manager? not sure if she was a manager or another server came to give us the check and when she went to go sit down the check she asked my husband what he had been drinking, he replied a coke. At this point I had already seen the amount of the final bill, which was $63. She said oh he forgot to charge for the coke but in that time I had seen the amount and had given her my card. When she came back after charging the card it was for $66 because she had added on the coke. Maybe I'm just being petty but it just irritated me on how she went about it.   With all that being said the food was good and our server was good, just the lady at the end made it a 3 star instead of a 4 star for me.",

Was left standing waiting for a table when there was many open tables for 30 minutes and more workers than even tables sitting down eating. Hopefully managers work more often because this use to be a favorite of ours but now the service has been drastically decreased.   DO NOT come here unless you don't mind waiting 1 hour to be seated and having to wait for customers who are not even present in the restaurant. No communication from the staff and we ending up leaving for somewhere else.  If you are looking for a management position I'm sure this place is hiring.",

    "text": "This was our first hibachi experience and it was a lot of fun! Our chef, Peter, was hilarious all the way through our meal! He's a large part of the reason it's 4 stars for my review.   The food was pretty good from the grill though though the salad and soup they serve prior to the meal leave a lot to be desired - small portions are fine but they just weren't tasty.   I ordered shrimp from the hibatchi and my hubs got chicken and steak. The meals also came with grilled vegetables and rice. Everything from the hibachi grill was very tasty and well cooked!   I did find fault in a couple of small things - 1. Being our first time there it would have been nice to have a little explanation of how it worked (they wait for the table to fill up a little at the seating time and then send a chef over. I was starving and there was no explanation about the wait for our chef). 2. Decor, counters where we sat, and the overall feel of the restaurant was a little dated/dingy feeling.   The couple of negatives were far outweighed by the quality of the actual meal and the interaction with the chef.",

I got the NY Strip and Scallops while my wife got the NY Strip. Each order came with a decent portion of veggies (standard carrots, zucchini, mushrooms onions, broccoli), noodles, white rice salad (dressing was way too watery) and soup.   The steak was cooked a little more well than I asked. As mentioned the salad was watery. The chef wasn't very graceful putting the food on my plate, kinda threw it at us. I'm totally down with them being funny but this was just more general sloppiness that I expect more from based on other experiences.  I think overall wasn't quite 5* but was really good. I would definitely go back.",

I will DEFINITELY be going back, and hopefully be served by Kevin!  I also want to say that the older asian man (i didn't catch his name) with black spikey hair who took our drink and beginning orders was so helpful! I am so grateful he explained to my mom when she didn't understand how to order. Thank you guys so much!! Please let Kevin and the older asian man know how truly grateful i am for their service!",

I got the NY strip with fried rice on the teppanyaki side which also comes with soup, veggies, and noodles. It was a lot of food, I ended up taking half of it home. It was decent and seemed to be fair for quality vs cost. It's a nice place to take people to if they've never had teppanyaki or just want some. The show with food was your typical show, I haven't seen anything I haven't seen before but it's still fun to watch.   I also got some nigiri sushi, tuna and salmon, both of which were pretty good. I honestly didn't expect much but the fish is pretty fresh for Vegas.   Cost vs quality I say it's decent. If I'm in the area I'll definitely stop by again but I wouldn't go out if my way to eat here.  Oh! The chef was pretty cool so we got him a shot of tequila to say thank you! =]",

    "text": "This may be the best teppanyaki I've ever had!   Went on Christmas eve and made a reservation.  They have a ton of tables there so it's a lot easier to get a spot on a busy day than at the one by my house.    The amount of food we got was ridiculous!  I got the teriyaki chicken and it was amazing and the portion, huge!  The meal comes with the soup and salad, white rice which you can upgrade to fried, and noodles.  The noodles are an added bonus because I've found that most places around here don't include them.    The prices are very reasonable and the service was good.  And who doesn't love a good show with their meal lol.  Will definitely be back!",

Prices were very reasonable. About $80 for two of us and we're both full when we left. I think they do have an AYCE as well.  We did not sit at the teppanyaki table, just had sushi. Fantastic service by Cindy and Mel. Never had to wait :)",

This was the worst service we have ever experienced. No greeting from our waitress, she simply said \"you want drinks?\" Messed up our drink order. Ordered 4 rolls and 2 soups. Never got the soups. We finished our rolls in about 10 minutes. Didn't see her for about 30 minutes so we could order another roll and asking for 1 soup now instead of 2. Waited another 30 minutes for our check. The whole time she was extremely rude. When handing me the check, I forgot to make sure one of the soups was off the bill. She came back with our change, minus the actual coins, which I like to get back. And there was no receipt. Not sure why she would take out the receipt, seemed very suspicious.  Considering she could have over charged by not taking the soup off and charging us for an iced tea we never got. Sadly, after over 3 years of coming to this place, I think its time to find a new place. Wasted time and money.",

Check out the pictures I posted! Sorry about the finger prints on my wine glass.   You'll see flames, tricks and flying shrimp! Sometimes the chef will throw a shrimp or two onto your plate! He'll catch an egg in his hat and play drums on the grill with his cooking utensils after lighting a huge flame on it. So far, I haven't seen a chef drop an egg on his face, hit someone in the head with a shrimp or light himself on fire. So I guess I'll keep going back! Haha!

We went during dinner and although it wasn't busy, it took quite a long time to get our rolls, although the starters did come promptly.  When we did get our rolls they looked quite pretty but upon trying to pick them up, some weren't cut all the way through and many would fall apart thus making them a bit difficult to eat.  The flavor just wasn't quite there either.  Some of the rolls were a bit bland while others seemed to have a taste as if the ingredients were out of proportion or something.  For me, I think the best part of the meal was the pork belly starter.  It was plain, it was simply grilled, and it was good.  I should've just gotten a bunch of those to be honest.    As I said earlier, not a bad meal but with so many other good to great sushi options in the valley, I felt kind of cheated coming here.  I may be back to try other dishes but I doubt it.",

I always order the Samurai surf and turf and the shrimp tempura roll. But today I ordered the spicy scallop roll instead and it was also delicious!  Even though I take it to go, they always pack it up nicely! (See pics)  The sushi is also decently priced and so tasty. They have an AYCE option and I enjoy that too on days where I want more selection than just 2-3 rolls. They have so many different kinds of rolls you an try and kudos for fun names.   I've eaten here multiple times and the staff is always very pleasant. They're usually pretty quiet on weekdays, so that's when I like to go!",

A mix of goods and bads. We tried somewhere new and it didn't work for us but I totally understand why other people like it.

From the moment I got there the staff seemed much more welcoming and helpful even before they knew that I had spoken with the manager and owner.   At first I sat at the bar and the very sweet server let me taste several sakes before I settled on a nice unfiltered. I moved over to the sushi bar for a late lunch. I decided to just enjoy the all-you-can-eat option with my sake. All in all I had a wonderful time and am looking forward to returning in the future. Everything was super tasty and the sushi chef even made me a speciality veggie roll. I really am stuck in between 4 and 5 stars. This really is a great spot in Henderson",

I've come here the last 4 years for my birthday (which was yesterday) and also for the last 4 anniversaries... That's how much we LOVE this place! Ofcourse we stop by just for dinner maybe once a month but this place is our staple for a celebratory dinner! My all time favorite roll is the \"What the heck\" roll which has the soft shell crab in the middle, spicy tuna on top with avocado, and a sweet mayo/siracha/onion sauce. It's on the spicy side. The \"fire roll\" is also a good option for anyone that likes heat. Hubby loves the classic Spicy Crab Roll which never fails. And the Shrimp Tempura Roll with the eel sauce is a must for a sweet kick after the spice! This time he got the \"Awesome roll\" which was equally yummy and on the sweet side with a small dot of siracha on top. Looooove getting a side of garlic ponzu as well! Seaweed salad is always refreshing, gyoza/pot stickers are crispy and yummy, and we got garlic edamame this time instead of the plain version which is also really tastey! Everything I get here is always superb. Even with the staff/management/owner changes, the quality of the food never changes and I can really appreciate that! My friends are always recommending different sushi places but there's only one place I will go to and it's this place. Thank you again for a fantastic birthday dinner. Will be back! Count on it",

Two of the three times I walked in, I seated myself after waiting near the \"Please wait to be seated\" sign for about 5 minutes without any human interaction. Once seated though, they're attentive, efficient, and helpful with food selection & drink refills.  Food: Everything is \"fresh\" and tasty. I usually recommend individual rolls, but here, everything is great. I like their spin on the Rainbow Roll, with spicy crab inside instead of the fake stuff.   Didn't get 5 stars for 2 reasons: Because they need better appetizer selection. Chicken and beef teriyaki, nachos, and other weird creations are avail at their competitors like Sakana and Sushi Twister. They don't include their best stuff in with their lunch price like most places do. I've lived all over the country and Vegas has more ayce sushi places than anywhere else, so the competition is HIGH. Need to keep up with rivals. Haha",

Got the spicy tuna roll, egg rolls, dynamite roll and a baked lobster lasagna. All were extremely delicious. My sushi chef was kind and sparked up conversation which I appreciated.  I ordered food to go as well for my husband back home and he although he's usually a harsh critic, he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. We'll be visiting again!",

    "text": "I love finding a good teppanyaki place, especially when it comes with a great sushi bar to match! Without a doubt the sushi was the best part of the evening and I was blown away with how affordable the rolls are, even the specialty rolls! I'll be back just for sushi for sure!  The teppanyaki experience was good, but perfunctory. I didn't feel our chef engaged with the table as much as I am accustomed to. They had all the expected tricks and thrills, but he didn't seem very enthusiastic or interested in creating an experience for the table. I was celebrating an important birthday and the other group we were seated with was celebrating two birthdays and the chef never asked if anyone was celebrating something- a pretty typical situation for groups at this style restaurant. I guess along the same lines, nobody really asked; not the host when I made the reservation, not the host when we checked in, not the server. The host wasn't very personable during our few interactions; after being asked to wait for our table, he basically ignored us when we told him we would wait at the bar for our table and he wasn't very pleasant when he eventually seated us.   All of the cooked food was good, but the steak was great! So tender and flavorful. The hibachi meals come with all the usual suspects- soup, salad, rice, veg, shrimp appetizer, but they also serve a simple noodle side with what I would describe as a light teriyaki sauce.   Now let's get back to the sushi! We tried the \"I love yellowtail\" roll, because I LOVE yellowtail :)) and the baked lobster roll. I'm normally not this first one to pick a warm/cooked roll but went with it on my friends selection. It was the best bite of the whole night! Super rich, loaded with crab and lobster, and a crisp freshness from the cucumber.   All in all, I will definitely be back for the good food and reasonably priced sushi, but the service all around needs to be a bit more polished and attentive to earn that 5th star from me.",

I didn't appreciate the cook's unsolicited comments regarding my hypothetical dating life and making weird personal comments to me in front of my family though. I had to ask him to stop/change the subject. There was a young family seated with us at the table, making his comments all the more uncomfortable for me (and probably them). The cook also told me his pay rate compared to his last job (apparently he is paid WAY less at Samurai). But other then that it was a great time.",

It is borderline disgusting, especially in the restroom.  Staff isn't too friendly, not very interactive and at times a bit short. Food is very mediocre and not very flavorful. It was the first time in my life that I came across a miso soup that was a tad sweet; pieces of nerves inside of my gyoza; and, a bowl of edamame mixed with my side of pure salt..lol for dessert I was served a frozen piece of cheesecake. It was absolutely not worth it..",

    "text": "Genuinely the poorest service I've ever received at a restaurant.   We had a reservation for 7:30pm for a party of seven. Around 7:45, a server pointed out our table, stating they were just waiting for that party to leave. That party left shortly after, and we watched the table sit, dirty, for another ten minutes. We were finally seated around 8pm.  Our server eventually came by. She was rather unpleasant and short with us, and made ordering far more complex than it should have been with everyone in our party doing AYCE. The few questions we asked were met with attitude.   We ordered two rounds of AYCE sushi. We're not huge eaters- our order wasn't anything abnormal large or elaborate... however, we ended up there for two hours. Each order took over thirty minutes to make it to our table. Our drinks (just water!) ran dry throughout the evening. Our server rarely checked on us- someone else brought out the sushi orders. Our check was NEVER brought to us- we waited over 45 minutes and our server never came back. We finally walked up to the host stand to pay ourselves. The host was apologetic. Our server walked up while we were paying and said nothing, just watched him run our cards and then left for the evening.   It's really a shame, because the food itself was good and the sushi was fresh. But, there's too many other great sushi options in the area to waste time at a place with such incredibly sub-par service. Given the number of good reviews for this location, I can only assume that this is not always the case... but again, with so many other great choices, you can bet that we won't waste our time here again.",

We walked in and were greeted by the host who gave us menus to look at because we couldn't decide whether we wanted a table, to sit at the  bar or at a hibachi table. We decided on the hibachi table. It's interesting to see the negative reviews on bad service because I ordered a iced green tea and my boyfriend a lemonade and our glasses were never empty, at one point the waitress even brought my bf two glasses of lemonade. So we each ordered a sushi roll as well as the teppanyaki meals one was the steak shrimp and scallops my boyfriend does not like veggies so we requested fried rice with no veggies while I wanted all the vegetables so he came out. Made sure who wanted what and made our meals separately while putting on a great show was very personable and our food was amazing..   So for two hibachi meals two drinks and two sushi rolls our bill was $77.. Very satisfied customers we will be back!",

We had an amazing chef who told us he had been there for 15 years. When he came over to us he fist pumped my husband and gave me a hug. He acted like he knew us for years and made us feel very welcome. He was very nice and talkative. He made us special sauces for our food. It was like having our very own personal chef. He definitely made a connection with us and created a lasting impression, two important things when it comes to customer service. Oh, the food was great, too!

That's something to put on the bucket list, but I have come to Samurai for each individually and I'm a fan of both. If you want to sit at the hibachi, I would definitely recommend reservations on the weekend. Otherwise, they have about a 10-12 seat sushi bar with a full dining area.  The AYCE is usually what I come here for. I've done it for lunch and have been in and out in less than an hour when I sit at the sushi bar. The sushi selection is standard and the service is consistently good for us. If you're not into AYCE, all of the nigiri and rolls are listed as half off. They also have a full selection of bento boxes which my wife orders from and they also have udon and ramen which I have yet to try.  We've done the hibachi once with the family and had a very enjoyable experience. The classic performance tricks were done which entertained everyone, especially the children. The chef batted .000 on the shrimp toss but he did well in cooking the food. Everyone was pleased with the grill items and their portions.  We'll be back again depending on what the family wants.",

It was wonderful I ate sushi and my boyfriend had the chefs cook his in front of us. The rolls I had which were the cooked lobster roll, the rainbow, and the orange crush were wonderful! His meal which was scallops, steak, and shrimp with noodles, fried rice, and vegetables was delicious. Great for a group or just a fun place with friends! The service was awesome everyone was really friendly and attentive. I will defiantly be coming back!",

We were pleasantly surprised to find a very extensive menu for those that are price-conscious sushi eaters as it can get expensive fast.  Great service... always welcoming, more than happy to accommodate guests. So good and friendly I ordered pickup sushi on way to hospital to have baby.... yeah, they are very into pleasing customers with fast, courteous service  and ALWAYS with a smile.",

    "text": "Came here on Sunday At 1130 am to have a celebratory birthday lunch with my son's friend.  I enjoyed coming here before it gets too busy!    1.  Ambiance - 4 star very nice and just right amount of lighting. Nice and roomy with bar area, sushi area, teppanyaki, normal seating.   There are three main teppanyaki areas that are two grills per area and seating for 20. However 2 of the seats are an add on as it seems someone bridges the two 9 seat grill areas with an extended table ao two can fit. I would not want to sit at that spot!  2.  The chef- 5 star-  John the chef for  teppan yaki was great! Entertaining, fun, listens to you and makes you feel very comfortable. Ask for him if you go there.   3.  Menu - 5 star - awesome menu from sushi to teriyaki to combo dishes to teppan yaki, all the choices for all tastes!  4.  The food- 2.5 star. Hmm maybe coming on Sunday was not the right timing.   A.  Miso soup 1 star. Uninspiring and not tasteful. Almost water like. The consistency was very diluted. The miso was not suspended well in the broth and the broth was  well watery.   B.  Salad - 1 star - they serve the salad with Miso Dressing and the salad was drenched in this!  The bottom inch of the bowl was full of miso dressing. Liquid. Japanese food is all about subtlety and this was not subtle.   C. Teppan yaki-  3 star - we ordered 4 orders of steak and lobster and they only had three. That is odd and yet they did offer to split it four ways and brought lots of shrimp. So that was a great solution. The steak was good, the chicken good, the salmon great, the fried rice nice. Okay stuff overall.   A big believer in Japanese food and natural flavored and since there is so much sauce I say this was good just hard to compare.   I like the place. I think it is a good place to entertain friends.   The entertainment factor is great,  the teppan yaki is okay too. I will be coming back to try the sushi as many yelpers rave about this!",

    "text": "Throughly enjoyed my entire experience here at Samurai! Greeted nicely by the host and had a 15 minute wait for a teppanyaki table. The great thing about this place is a full-service bar! I'd recommend the Tokyo tea. They have three types of seating: teppanyaki, regular dining, and the sushi bar.   After seating down, my friend and I ordered some sushi in addition to our teppanyaki meal. I ordered the Japanese lasagna because it sounded interesting and was pleasantly surprised by the taste. My friend ordered the Kamikaze roll, which was a fried California roll. Both roles were great, and will try the all you can eat sushi the next time I come.  As for the teppanyaki, the portions are huge! They offer fried rice and fried noodles in addition to your protein and grilled vegetables. My last name was Jack and was skilled and very friendly to the entire table. I had the New York steak and scallop combo which were actually cooked by Jack.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and will be back again soon!",

We had a minor service hiccup the 2nd time, but we think it may be due to unexpected short staff on a Wednesday night and the place was busy.  We expressed our dissatisfaction with the service to the manager, Kazu.  He was very understanding and even discounted our meal (although this wasn't requested or expected).  The 3rd time we came back, we brought 2 young kids with us and sat at one of the Tepanyaki grills.  We all had a great fun time.  The kids were very entertained.  The chef made sure to include them in the presentation.  The food was excellent, and we feel the price is a good deal for the quality and service.  The previous 2 visits were both all you can eat sushi, which is also priced properly and with a very large selection of specialty rolls and non sushi items included. The quality of the sushi was great.  We will be returning again in the future and recommend this to both adults and for children.  It's a family friendly environment, yet there was not many children during any of the 3 visits. Thanks again for the great night!",

We sat at the bar and the food was good, it was both filling for a lunch and it was half price. The only other place I know that does that is  Kobe sushi. The sushi was average but it's definitely the place to go when you want sushi but not hungry enough for All You Can Eat. It's a great lunch place, sushi quality is very similar to Kobe sushi. A way better choice than eating grocery store sushi!",

    "text": "As you read this review, please note that there is an update at the end!!!  I have mixed feeling about this place because it has so much potential. While the food was tasty, my problem with this place concerns the lack of quality customer service.   It took them 15 minutes to take our order while our menu (yes I said one because they only gave us one menu when I had asked for two) was closed and waiters/waitresses were walking around , my girlfriend and I ordered appetizers and 2 entrees, my entree came with the appetizer and then 15 minutes later my girlfriend's entree came. Didn't give us a refill on our waters for the hour that we were there. When we finally finished our food, the waiter passed by our table maybe 3 times just staring at us while I was signalling them to come over. Now when they finally came over, a cool 20 minutes after we were done eating, we asked for our check, paid and then left.   Ten minutes after we left I realized I forgot my electronic cigarette on the table and called where a lady picked up the phone and had no idea what I was talking about, so I decided to go back. I was met by an annoyed manager that just wanted me out of his restaurant, he told me that his busboy didn't see anything and had already cleared the table, I asked him if he could please make sure that the bus boy didn't see anything and he said \"I'm sure he said he didn't see anything\". After insisting that I see this busboy to hear it from his mouth and make positively sure (because it was a 300 dollar piece) that it wasn't there anymore, he agreed, went to his bus boy and asked him the question and the bus boy said that he didn't clear the table and that another person did it, so it showed me that the manager didn't even ask the right person about my vape, In the end the other bus boy said that he didn't see anything and anything on the table was thrown away? Okay, makes sense you threw away your plates whatever. They didn't even offer to show me where the garbage was or help me look for it....  All in all they don't care about you having a great experience. They just want you to eat get out and have the next group of people come in. If you want an all around good experience, don't go here, go to yama sushi for AYCE sushi, you want teppanyaki go to Benihana's. You want something cheap, with a substandard experience and inferior service, this is the place to be!!  UPDATE: The owner was kind enough to contact me and explained the situation as a whole.... The truth is that the person I talked to about my electronic cigarette was not actually the owner or even the person in charge so it was totally handled the wrong was and I wasn't even supposed to be talking to that person. The owner apologized and handled the matter very professionally and was far above my expectation on what he was willing to do to make me a satisfied customer which I am now... I would like to thank the owner for contacting me and clarifying the issues that we had an promptly returning my electronic cigarette! The food was honestly great and the management was just a little bit off that time. I've been here numerous times and this was the first time something bad happened, and even though it was bad, it was promptly and professionally resolved. Thank you again!",

My husband was brought a regular drink. Noting the difference we asked another server that said they don't carry the diet version. The cook got my order wrong, giving me the wrong protein. Our cook chef Ken spent the entire time ignoring my husband, my father and myself to flirt with a woman on the other end of the grill. My father asked me why I wasn't eating the fish that I normally ordered, when Ken overheard he snidely said \"what you're pregnant\". To which I replied \"I am\". No congrats were offered or anything. Being as this was literally the only thing he said to us the entire time other than \"how do you want your steak done?\" I found it to be extremely rude. We won't be back. If I could have given them zero stars, I would have.  The owner himself has contacted me trying to rectify the situation. I appreciate this being that I understand one employee should now ruin an entire business. So I am adding a star for the owner's customer service.",

Wait staff is ok, they are not attentive except for one woman who is great and dances with the birthday music. My biggest complaint is the wait, sometimes you have to wait at your table for an hour or longer to get the cook to your table. I am sure it is unpredictable how busy it will be but with small children this makes for a not so enjoyable night.  I also think the place could be cleaner, the chairs are very sticky. The place definitely could be cleaner. These days it seems like the wait gets longer because they have less or all new cooks.  Cleanliness is an issue, the chairs and carpet is very sticky.",

Asked what we wanted to drink; some of us ordered soft drinks and some water.  3. Told the waitress we were ready to order (because it took that long, without her asking us once if we wanted to order or need explanation of the menu)  4. She then said sure \" I'll be right back\" (was gone for 3-4 mins) then came back and asked the people who were drinking water if they would like a drink. (up-selling trick for soft drinks or other drink with higher then food margins) When they said no they were ok with the waters, she then again said \"I'll be right back\" (gone for another 3-5 mins)   Seems like this is another selling tactic to make people order a lot because they made them wait so long to order!  5. Ordered food.... food was average at best. I would normally tell you guys what I ordered but if you have read the review this far you should not really care what I got... Save yourself the time and money and go to a better sushi place.   There are some others in the area that have 4-5 star reviews on Yelp from me and other Yelpers....Happy hunting!",

    "text": "I am probably not the best person to talk to in regards to sushi, seeing as how I dislike most seafood options out there.   We ordered some California, spicy tuna, and salmon with avocado rolls. I wasn't a huge fan of the tuna or salmon, which I tend to enjoy on most occasions at other sushi places. Thus, we ended up ordering three more plates of California rolls! Hard to mess those up.  However, prices are more than decent (50% off for rolls), service was good, and atmosphere was enjoyable. It'd be fun to go with a large group and try out the teppanyaki. Another added bonus (for me)-- they play kpop and jpop while you dine!   **Note: There is an all-you-can-eat option for about $26 (dinner) with a 45-minute time limit. Make sure you specify if you're doing AYCE or a la carte, otherwise they will probably charge you for AYCE!",

We had a little wait to be seated, no worries, we arrived shortly after the evening rush so expected a wait.  After being seated, we waited...and waited..and waited...Finally a waitress asked us if we were ready to order, I said \"sure, let me get the Turducken with all the sides\"  A blank look from the waitress....  \"Oh you don't have menu's !\" she finally caught on....After that service was smooth.  Steak (new york) shrimp and chicken, fried rice and some veggies...  All in all pretty good, for the price very good.  Everything cooked well and it certainly hit the spot.  The only thing I will say is, it wasn't as good as Geisha House, the portions were larger (lots of shrimp) but Geisha House just plain tastes better.  This is of course subjective, both places are good, but Geisha House is till my True love.",

Now, I've been to a number of sushi places and I've gotten to know what is normally good and bad sushi, as well as what the prices normally are for all you can eat. Long story short, loved the sushi and the large amount of options available but did not like the amount that the total came to at the end. Never in my life have I made more than $30 for all you can eat sushi that was this far from the strip. Now this is somewhat my fault for not asking the price beforehand, however, there was no place that showed the price which rubbed me the wrong way. Would not recommend this place for all you can eat. Sushi wasn't bad though so I would recommend for that.",

We were seated at the grill & were told it would be 20-30 minutes before we could order because our party of 3 was the only one at the grill.  Option B was to sit at a regular table & we could order from the teppanyaki menu there.  We opted for that so we could order faster.  So to start, the fried rice and the rice in our Firecracker roll was gross and way over-cooked.  If there's ONE thing a Japanese place needs to get right, it's the rice.    Two of us ordered the filet steak, one medium-well and one medium rare - both were cooked WELL.  The third in our party ordered the NY steak, medium rare and it was also cooked WELL.  In addition to being over cooked, all of the steak was kind of flavorless and bland.  The teriyaki chicken was also overcooked and had a super bland flavor.  One of us got scallops, which were - you guessed it!  Over-cooked and bland.  Maybe the chefs are afraid of food poisoning and cook the crap out of everything, just to be safe?  I dunno, but over all I'd classify this food as merely edible and overpriced for what you get.  Oops, I forgot to mention that the service was non-existent.  Our waiter was pleasant, but I think we saw him maybe 2 times during our dinner.  We all left regretting our dining decision and mourning the small dent in our wallets :(",

Secondly just how it was your birthday it was also my husbands birthday and every time we go my husband BUYS him 1 beer ! Yes one beer and sake shots it's a tradition to us .. no one has ever minded that before he wasn't wasted cooking because that's how you made it seem .. also if I recall you ordered your steak well done (technically over cooked) you also got your steak before we did . And to make it clear the only thing that was comped was the sake ! We paid for our tab just like all you did and that money my husband was trying to give him was a tip!! We always tip him separately because they don't give the tips from the servers to the cooks ! But because it was my husbands birthday he didn't want to take the tip ! We still gave him a tip on top of tipping the servers and paying our tab ! Geo is the best cook there that is a promise to anyone that goes you won't be disappointed unless you're a hater like Amanda and get upset that he's grown friendships with his clients after the years !she forgot to mention that she got a free dessert and we all sang happy birthday at the table . She must of liked that part only ! I always recommend him and this place to everyone ! Never disappoints!",

We came here on Valentine's Day...with our kid and no reservations; fully expecting to just sit at a normal table with no teppan service because of the crowds and reservations on V-day. The Owner himself found us a seat at teppan, then our Chef who awesomely named himself \"Daniel-son\" (for those Karate Kid fans) and he was AWESOME!!! So polite, entertaining as hell and the food was cooked really perfectly to our individual preferences. We then got into our drinks too long after and were overstaying our welcome, the Owner politely asked us to switch to a booth which normally I would be pissed about but the fact that reservations were arriving and we had none and he sat us anyways made me realize I was being a bit inconsiderate and made me so grateful for the actual care and love that this guy puts into his place of business. Another Bravo! We will definitely return and recommend. Also, the pricing is extremely fair considering the quality, quantity and amazing service provided. Give it a shot!",

They always were TERRIBLE servers. We waited 15 minutes for our damn check. Oh! And we got our appetizers after we finished our entrees. This place was a joke! AND, our booth wreaked of urine.

Pickled ginger and wasabi were both dried out and sad looking, like they filled the dish hours before and let it sit.  Waitress very dictating about the rules. We do AYCE sushi a lot, we get it. No need to point out how many pieces of nigiri I'm ordering or tell me to order many small orders instead of one large one.  I have concerns about their food handling procedures: edamame on top was lukewarm, pieces under those were hot, and ones under those were ice cold.  Sexy girl roll comes out (which we didn't order but weren't sure since they took our menu), the tempura shrimp in the roll wasn't warm at all.  All other sushi was about room temp but the screaming-O was ice cold.  Most of the sushi rolls were not well wrapped and fell apart.  Nothing tasted fresh. Final small order took twenty minutes to come out.  Had to ask for the check three times.  In all a mediocre dining experience. With all our local restaurant choices, this place needs to step it up.",

The wait was actually 35min. Their waiting area is super tiny and crowded and they only have 2 seats for all the people waiting. Secondly their parking lot is a mess. The restaurant wasn't even packed for the size of the restaurant but there was limited parking. The parking lot design was horrible. You have to make a 3 point turn into the back lot where it ends in a dead end. We parked in the lot next door because the lot was a cluster fuck.  After we finally got seated by Stoner Dennis the menace host who literally couldn't make eye contact with us and had no idea what was going on with the table situation, he has the nerve to ask if we want our table wiped. The table was dripping wet and had food particles on it. After he cleaned it with this smelly rag that he grabbed from who knows where he then started to fan the table with the menus to dry it!!!  Fine we sit down cause I'm just thinking this guy is an idiot but then he passes us the menu and it is wet and covered in what looks like mas ago:orange fish eggs and sticky pieces of rice. My friends and I are hungry at this point to where it now takes another 10min to get water and then our waitress Jenny didn't even take our order. When she came back to drop off our water, she spilled the water all over the menu and instead of placing them down in front of each person she just put them in a pile and shoved it toward us as she walked away. I was pretty pissed at this point and even asked my friends if we should leave, but we were so hungry at this point we had given up.  We ordered the bento boxes which came with quite a bit of food. Bento box tonkatsu and Teri chicken. The chicken was super dry but the tonkatsu was decent: fried and fresh. Not super flavorful but it came with a heaping pile of rice, California roll (tasted horrible), 4 pieces of tempura, 2 Goyza and a small bowl of miso soup, we also got 2 Ikura nigiri and 1 sake nigiri. It was also ok. I couldn't tell if it was fresh but one thing I did notice is the rice was too sweet for my liking.  The best part of the meal was another waiter/bus boy Mel. He was so happy, introduced us and got us refills on water, any side extras and always came to check up on us. On top of that they serve Sapporo in chilled glasses which made this place tolerable.  Overall horrible service and subpar Asian food. I don't understand why this place is rated as high as it is. One thing I can guess is this place is filled with non Asian people who don't know the difference.",

The host greeted us right away and seated us in a comfortable booth for our lunch. We saw a sign for $21.95 all you can eat sushi, but having never been before we decided just to order a la carte.   I started with edamame and a house salad. I love the cold, creamy ginger dressing on salads at Japanese restaurants so this didn't disappoint. The edamame was okay, but a little more on the tough side with a little too much salt.  My husband and I shared three rolls for lunch. We enjoyed the Lobster Roll, Red Rock Roll, and Mexican Fiesta Roll. All of them were really good and made me wish we had gone for the all you can eat sushi option. All of the rolls had a great combination of flavors and sauces. Everything tasted very fresh.",

I than ask \" so you'd rather have me leave?\" Theres a moment of silence so i just walked out and said \"Have a Good Night.\"  Pretty bad when all this happens and the whole time you are dealing with the Restaurant Manager.

    "text": "This place seems to provide several dining options: sit-down, sushi bar, AYCE, teppenyaki.  Took my family here for the teppenyaki option and enjoyed it. Depending on the platter, you can choose from 1 to 3 items, ranging from $12.95 (vegetable) all the way to $41.95 (filet mignon+lobster+scallops). My dad and sister picked the NY steak with choice of scallops/mahi-mahi/shrimp for $22.95, while my brother and I opted for the teriyaki chicken with choice of shrimp/salmon/calamari/mahi-mahi for $18.95. Reasonably cheap considering what else is included in the price:  We were served a mushroom soup to start, followed by a small bowl of salad -- this was appealing and a nice start to our dining experience. Our chef appeared shortly after with his cartful of necessary ingredients and began his hibachi show. He started off with the rice (we substituted and paid extra for it to be fried rice), tossed us some appetizer shrimp, followed by a mixture of vegetables, then each of our main courses, AND then some noodles, which was my least favorite side. It seemed like it was just spaghetti noodles with some brown sauce. Everything else was pretty good, but not really the best I've eaten. (It's no Benihana's!)  In short, though, you get a lot of food and it's cooked right in front of you. Our chef entertained us with tactical flying spatulas and acrobatic eggs, heart-shapes, food trains, and a volcano show concocted from onions and oil. It was a fun dining experience for an affordable price.",

Our waitress was nice and friendly. But she was not attentive. She rarely came to our table when we wanted to order. Thankfully our first round of sushi we ordered quite a bit. Maybe because it was a Friday night, but the cooks were slow. It took maybe 45 minutes to get our first order! And it came so sporadically. We would get one plate, finish that plate, wait another 15-20 minutes, get another plate. It was RIDICIULOUS. I mean, you go to all you can eat sushi with an appetite. And having to wait so long for your food is just not what you want or expect. The waitress was nice enough to apologize that our food was so slow. I think overall it took us 2 hours to eat all you can eat sushi because of the waiting. We probably got less than 8 plates. That's absurd.   FOOD: the food though was so good! The fish was fresh and cut to decent sizes. When you bit into the salmon you can bite into it without having to chew it in half, so fresh. The rolls we got were all delicious, I'm sure the other rolls on the menu are just as good!!! The nigiri is what we mainly went for, and what I would go back for!   ENVIORNMENT:  A good size alcoholic bar area! The sushi bar looked like a good size as well! The restaurant itself is very big spacious. Enough teppanyaki tables and a good amount of tables for eating sushi.  ETC: If you come here on a Friday night, come here early!!! Or you will be waiting forever for your sushi...",

    "text": "First time dining here so we went for an early dinner to avoid the crowds but it was pretty much empty. There was no hostess as we walked in and stood in the entry for awhile until someone saw us and seated us.  Then we waited at least 20 minutes for our waitress to come to our table while she passed our table several times completely ignoring us. They sat 2 more tables after us and she quickly served them first.   We almost walked out before she finally stopped at our table with not a single greeting, smile and hardly a word. It was very uncomfortable. She took our order then disappeared again. We were hoping the food would make up for the horrible service but the bento boxes were mediocre and not appetizing. We did not finish our food and she did not return after we got our food. We just wanted to leave. We flagged her down to get the check and of course that came quickly.  We never felt so relieved to leave an establishment before.",

This is his establishment he represents and as of this point, he is coming off as rather deranged because someone had an opinion he didn't like. I WILL NOT REMOVE MY REVIEW. LEAVE ME ALONE FREDDY. CEASE AND DESIST.  We walked in and the place looked rundown. I guess you could say it is family friendly as it was full of kids and babies. That's not negative, just a helpful tip. However, it is certainly not even close to a classy establishment. It was a dive. No hostess to greet us, we left. I did give two stars but decided to change it to one due to recent angry and threatening messages from the owner because I spoke my mind. It's called Freedom of Speech. It's in the Constitution and it's allowed.   My advice to management would be, stop lashing out at reviewers who had a bad experience and I can see on here there are a few of us describing the same thing. Rather, learn from their words and take steps to rectify the problems. Spend some cash, not a lot and make the place a little nicer, a little cleaner. Train some hostesses. You'll appeal to a wider demographic and might actually make more money and that is the goal, I'm sure.  Yes I am different, Freddy. I don't respond to harassment and threats and never will. I'm forced to communicate this way as you have shut down any effort to communicate by blocking me after you sent me your threats so therefore, here we have it. Be grateful I did change it. Yelp handled it the first time. You've made your point, you're only making yourself look nuts at this point but hey, it's your business you're representing not mine. I've gone as far as I'm willing to in order to placate you now leave me alone.",

    "text": "Samurai Japanese Steakhouse is my family's go-to place for very special occasions. Recently we had friends come in from Alaska and they rented a limo to explore the strip and to take us somewhere to eat. Samurai was our choice on where to go first and as always they delivered an outstanding experience that still has our friends talking about it days later.   On our most recent visit we had the privilege of having their head Tappanyaki chef put on quite a show for us and he took the time to entertain both the adults in our group and the 7 year old who was with us. While the presentation was very good, the food was exceptional. From the steak that was cooked exactly the way you wanted it that melts in your mouth, to the perfectly prepared lobster tails to the shrimp we loved (and I do mean loved) everything that was prepared for us.   We did have a slight wait to be seated at the Tappanyaki table. And yes the place is not spotless. The glass on the front door could use some cleaning. And the bathrooms while clean could use some updating. But we ignore that because once our family sits down at the Tappanyaki table we know we're in for a treat, and Samurai never fails to deliver outstanding food at least when it comes to the Tappanyaki experience.   4 Stars. I won't go with 5 because I wish they would keep someone at the front door to help get you on the wait list faster and a little bit of time spent spiffing the place up to match the excellence of their food would help. But I will say this. While it's not cheap we pay the bill with a smile as we're walking out the door happy and satisfied. And yeah, we will certainly be back.",

Our chef was definitely an entertainer...wish I knew his name. Shorter gentleman, Spanish accent, did a steam train with the onions that positively mesmerized our boys. We were all so intently watching him & the speed he could cut, chop & dice things that we kept forgetting to actually eat!

They were nice enough to allow me to only order sushi at the hibachi grill since I wasn't as hungry. I had a few bites of my boyfriend's and it was delish.

Our chef was friendly and cooked our steaks perfectly to our liking but wasn't that entertaining for a interactive cook but food was good.   Sushi was mediocre. Not a place I would go to for sushi but it served its purpose.   It's pricey but if your trying to avoid the strip.. It's a decent place. Will come again for the tepanyaki n not so much the sushi",

Oh they let you create your own combo of it's not on the menu and their kids menu had a variety of foods (we didn't have kids with us; but my kids love Teppan too) Only area of improvement was the dipping sauce- ginger was too runny and I don't know what the other was.

Great portions, so much so we all had enough for a couple of meals to take home.

Would be a place where I can do a get together with my friends and family. I would totally recommend Cindy.",

We've been here multiple times and been seated at both the cooking table (amazing!) and a regular table. All experiences here have been great. The service is really good and friendly, and the cooking table is a great, fun show. But the real winner here is the food! My girlfriend is a big sushi eater and has loved every bite here. I'm not as adventurous and so sometimes get their teriyaki chicken or salmon bento boxes, which are delicious! Most sushi restaurants (understandably) do not serve good \"alternative\" options like chicken which are almost always fatty, gross dishes. But not here! This is the only sushi restaurant I've been to that is spot on with every dish; even the kids' menu! A must-eat in Henderson and worth every penny.",

    "text": "I was heading towards the strip in Las Vegas with some friends a couple weekends ago, when somewhere along the way we diverged from our path, took a wrong turn, and found this gem. We were too hungry to wait any longer and Teppanyaki sounded like a great way to start off our weekend, so we decided to go in. It was the best decision we made because it was hands down the most exciting (and not to mention most delicious) teppanyaki experience I have ever had thus far! There were some people at the bar and several other groups sitting at the other grills. The ambiance is casual and trendy, and the service is exceptional, especially our chef!! I so desperately wish I can remember his name! He deserves credit on Yelp. He was soo incredibly entertaining while skillful in the way he cooked our food. The four of us ordered a LOT - lobster (my personal favorite), filet mignon, grilled salmon, fresh sashimi, jalapeno bombs (a MUST TRY if you're into spicy!!), several side dishes such as miso soup (which was peculiarly tasty, much different from other miso soups I've tried in California), and salad, along with a whole lot of Japanese beers and sake. We all had a ton of fun as they led us on with loud sake bomb chants! Also, I can't forget to mention the special birthday treat. It was my 21st birthday so they changed the music they had playing into an exciting \"Happy Birthday\" song for the whole restaurant to hear. The curious attention of all the other customers were on our group. The waitress brought out some free dessert, and everyone had a birthday shot with me. What a great way to start off our weekend in Vegas.   Sigh, if only this place were closer to where I live in California...   We all thoroughly enjoyed our experience there and decided that whenever we choose to visit Vegas again, we will definitely be going back! No doubt!",

    "text": "As a frequent dinner here, we would have been more than happy to give 5 stars.  We spend our thanksgivings here, as we don't have any family here. We love the sushi, the ambiance, etc... But tonight that all changed.  After a horrible day with no air conditioning we decided we would go out for sushi... We were seated right away as always. The waitress came up after a good few minutes of waiting, took our drink order, and walked off. Come back and tells us they only have one apple juice for my two kids. Ok fine, split it and top it with water. No big deal. Drinks come. Mine should've had alcohol in it but didn't taste like it.  Now this is where it goes south. She comes to take our order... I order the kids teriyaki chicken for my 3 year old, a California roll with soy paper for my 5 year old, and a 007, spicy crab, and California express for myself all on spy paper.  She then turns to walk away... Without even taking my husbands order... So we say wait we aren't done.  He orders the all you can east sushi and tells her the rolls he wants to start with. She walks away.  When our orders start coming out first it's my sons chicken, and a plate with a California roll, and spicy crab roll.  A few minutes go by and two of my husbands rolls come out. A few more minutes and we stop the waitress because the rest of his rolls and my 5 year old roll never came out.  She come back with my husbands rolls and runs off. We stop her again and for my sons roll and she says oh it's coming.  Meanwhile he's hungry and whining. She brings his roll out but it's wrong. Whatever he eats it anyways... My 3 year old was still actively eating and she asked if we wanted a box for his food. Ummm no.... He's still eating....  She refills my husbands drink, and takes my drink but never asks if I wanted another... My husband goes to order more rolls and she says \"wait, you wanted all you can eat sushi??\" It was at that point we gave up and said forget it we are done.  Went too find a manager and guess what. There's none to be found. There's the head sushi chef, and the head hibachi chef, both are busy and the sushi chef needed translation.... After a few minutes of waiting for the bill we are told they would bring us desert.  We declined because we were just done, and fed up. We went to a place we've always had an enjoyable time at, but we were just served a headache and until we complained we were rushed to eat and get out....  I can't say we will come back ever, which is disheartening because, we actually enjoyed coming here. The food is great. The hibachi noodles are to die for. But with that service.... We won't. I'm not spending over $100 on food when we are treated that way...  Oh and for a table that just ordered 7 sushi rolls... More than one thing of wasabi and ginger would be great...",

    "text": "This is the Japanese restaurant that has taken over the building where Fukuda once was, at Sunset and Marks. I have made a few visits already, and have been thoroughly impressed.  If you were a regular Fukuda patron, fear not - from what I can tell most of the food items are pretty much the same, and that's a good thing. From what I can tell, the only substantial changes have been some of the decor, and some of the employees, and owners.   Each time I've visited, the staff have always been friendly, servers and teppanyaki chefs alike. Everyone here seems to enjoy their job, and they create a solid, welcoming atmosphere. The decor inside the restaurant is top-notch. Not quite Benihana-level fancy, but there's only so much you can do with a building like this, and I think they have created a solid atmosphere in all aspects.  The food is nothing short of excellent. I am typically a chicken and steak eater, and their teppanyaki takes on these items are great. The soup and fried rice are amongst the best I have had in these kinds of restaurants. With your meal, they even provide noodles, something not many other restaurants like this do - and they are quite delicious as well.   As far as pricing goes, they are more than fair. I have seen similar items at other teppanyaki-style restaurants go for far more expensive prices - and they generally offer far less food with their meals. These portions are large, and if anything, I believe you are getting an excellent deal here.  I wouldn't necessarily call this the best teppanyaki-style restaurant I have ever eaten in, but at the rate things are going, that could change very soon. They have great staff, excellent food, a good atmosphere, and a convenient location. For the time being I am giving this place a solid 4/5 rating, and that could be going up to a full 5/5 very soon.  Final verdict? I strongly recommend this restaurant!",
