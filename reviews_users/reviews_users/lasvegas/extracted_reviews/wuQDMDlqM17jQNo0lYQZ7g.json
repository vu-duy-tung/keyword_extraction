We were late and I called and they kept the table inside ready for us! We just had a drink & then the fried pickles and the wings. These were so good! We loved both items. We opted for the chipotle bar-b-q sauce for the wings and the pickles were wicked spicy good! Service by Mikey was good! He was very nice and personable and took good care of us. The manager checked on us as well and wanted to make sure we liked everything! A pleasant good experience with very good bar food. Love the decor and it was a bit rainy outside and very comfortable inside where we ate. We will definitely be back next trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "I came here for brunch on a Sunday morning around 11:30/12.   Wait: There was no wait for the outdoor space, so we were able to find a table in the shade. Indoor wait for two was about 20-30 minutes, and the bar top was full.   Decor: Really cute spot. Quirky wallpaper, lots of random chandeliers, old vintage chairs outside. The outdoor space (like someone else mentioned) really is like a work of art. There's a carriage above the famous neon sign. So random, but adds character to the space. I would like my backyard to be as fun as this place. There's also a hidden seesaw and a few more seats behind the fireplace.   Food: I had the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tater tots. It came with syrup and another sauce (I can't quite place it, but it was amazing). Food was hot and freshly cooked, flavorful, and filling. I also had the cold brew with it.   Service: Attentive and quick. No complaints!",

I've been for late night drinks and for brunch during the day and each time the servers are great and pretty efficient.  I will also say that I've been enough times to try a handful of their menu options, from their philly mac and cheese (or something incredibly delicious like that) to a salad even - and that was yummy, too. Pictured is their breakfast burrito that was great for brunch and had a nice kick to it, too.   Don't forget to sneak in the back and see the teeter-totter!",

    "text": "I'm still quite new to the Downtown Las Vegas dining scene, so coming across Park On Fremont was a little bit of a nice surprise for me.  I loved how it was right across the street from the bus stop and also the fact that it's on Fremont Street made the place was easy to find.  It was a beautiful day outside when I went so I decided to sit out on their Patio (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1neEIIF&s=07efeb37a689b556bd202a64d25f9b11da8e79e05ab46accf25393b15bd56751\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1neEIIF</a>).  Let's get to the food.  Basically I heard about their Philly Mac and Cheese Steak and saw some pics of it on yelp.  So I wanted to give it a go just because of how crazy good it looked.  Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. --  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F1mfuMNf&s=bf763aca9136e9c149a37e2cf3cdd79d78911cf6b6766190408d7b4a58c52b95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/1mfuMNf</a> Thin sliced sirloin with bell peppers and onions, topped with mac & cheese. On paper, the Philly Mac & Cheese Steak sounds over the top delicious.  But overall it was really dry.  I think mine could've used a lot more cheese sauce.  That probably would've made it a lot better.  Nice try though!  The side of sweet potato tots were good though and I'm glad they threw in some honey mustard dipping sauce for it.  Service was really good here.  My waitress was really friendly and enthusiastic and always checked on me.  But then again, I was the only customer out on the patio at the time.  I could imagine things getting a little hectic later in the day and at night especially.  No complaints from me though, my server was awesome!  I'm more than likely going to come back to Park on Fremont again since I'm a huge sucker for Gastropubs and their menu has a lot more interesting dishes I'd like to try like their Mac & Cheese Balls, Garbage Fries, Fried Chicken & Waffle Sandwich, and Bacon Wrapped Corn Dogs.  I'm definitely looking forward to trying all of those!",

The drink menu could be expanded a bit with some more tasty, seasonal, fun drinks.  Garbage fries really are good, and so is pretty much everything I've eaten so far.  I love the Monte Cristo on the brunch menu, even though it really is just a ham and cheese french toast sandwich sprinkled in powdered sugar.  That will be pretty good no matter what, especially topped with a little maple syrup!    Definitely a cool bar and restaurant in a hip part of downtown!  I enjoy the nights when they have free live music as well.  Really cool vibe..my suggestion is bring the service level and attitude up a bit and this place would be unbeatable!",

We initially were sitting in the back but were not able to get service so we moved up front to the bar on the outside, service was better, obviously. Then more of our party arrived and the bar got over crowded so we moved to a nearby table that had just vacated, lots of empty cups sat on the table for roughly 20 minutes. We pushed them to the end and waited for service. The first time some man came to the table to inform us that we were at a \"eating table\" he began cleaning glasses and I asked for a menu to order food. 10 minutes passed, our drink were empty by then, a woman comes to the table and tells us \"very matter of factly\" that we need to order food or we have to move. We would have gladly stayed, ordered food and probably 5 or 6 more rounds but we opted to not spend our time where we would get crappy service. Just to throw it out there, this place was not busy, plenty of \"eating\" tables were open and with so many bars around you would think they would want to keep the business and not shu it away.",

The crowd is great if you don't mind hipsters. Plaid shirts, boots, full-sleeve tats and beards...with music you probably have never heard of playing in the background. There's a song that was so not mainstream, Shazam doesn't even know what it is. Is the food from a local source? IDK. Does it have bacon? Yes. Do you drink from mason jars? Yes. Do you have doughnuts? Yes.  Bacon-Wrapped Corn Dogs: The more I tell myself I'm going to eat healthy food, the more I rebel. I like to wrap my arms around my legs in yoga and my corn dogs wrapped around with bacon. You get 2 big corn dogs served with Sriracha ketchup and a spicy mustard. The bacon is wrapped around the hotdog then dipped in batter - part of bacon enjoyment is the crispy salty goodness but you won't get that with this. 3/5  Philly Mac and Cheese Steak: This cheesesteak was actually good but there was just too much bread, not enough meat. Carbo-loading? This is for you. 3.5/5  Stranger Danger: Peach vodka and iced tea. If you like peach-flavored anything then, you might like this drink. I don't.  Trophy Wife: Rum, OJ, pineapple juice, lemon, simple syrup and bitters. This was pretty refreshing. Fruity and delicious.  They do have salads. Looking back, they do have delicious-sounding salads like Strawberry Summer Salad, Steak Salad, Ahi Tuna Salad, etc. But on my last night of drinking, I wanted to get something with more substance. On the menu, right below salads: deep-fried Oreo and Girl Scout Cookies, and Donut Ice Cream Sandwich!  If you don't like scary movies, stay away from the bathroom or you'll piss your pants. There are creepy pictures on the wall and in front of the sink and in between the two mirrors is a reminder for you to wash your hands: \"Employees must say Bloody Mary three times into mirror before returning to work\" - if you've seen the movie...you'll know what happens.",

However, the stuffed wild fowl behind the bar are appropriate fixtures in this contemporary, urban play on a vintage, Texas hunting lodge.  The menu is short, simple and centered on South-Western American fair and barbecue.    I arrived for brunch semi-haphazardly as Eat was over-booked and The Beat was having trouble with their cash register. The staff at Park greeted me pleasantly. The Server was certainly enthusiastic about the food and I took her recommendations: the Texas Tuxedo Bloody Mary and the Ranch Breakfast Skillet. I also had a cup of joe.  First, I should state that the coffee was proper, as far as restaurant coffee goes.  It was fresh and just the right strength. The Bloody Mary, featuring fresh basil and a cucumber slice, was savory and refreshing,  peppery and minty.  It was an original recipe that became an instant classic for me.    The Ranch Skillet was not a disappointment, either.  When it was laid before me, I found layer after layer after layer of breakfast ingredients stacked one on top of the other: a bed of crisped red potato wedges, grilled onions and peppers, a scoop of chorizo, a handful of cheddar, and two perfectly fried eggs, all served in a sizzling cast-iron skillet. I recommend this to any patron looking for a spicy South Western breakfast.  The skill of the restaurant's kitchen staff showed through in the Ranch Skillet as well as their commitment to quality and attention to detail.    I encourage every one to visit Park on Fremont for brunch.  It was certainly a happy accident that I wandered in this morning, but it was no accident that the food was excellent... because these folks really know what they're doing.  I wish them much success!!",

    "text": "I have to say this place is probably the most awesome southern bar I've been to in the heart of Las Vegas. We were recommended to try it by a local Uber driver, Connie. I told her about my cravings of a killer Bloody Mary and she said this was the place to be. She did not steer us wrong! I ordered the Bloody Mary with the Basil and drank that sucker so fast I forgot my first name! The perfect amount of fresh, spicy, and tangy. We then ordered a bottle of champagne for $20 and split that. I was truly enjoying every minute of Park on Fremont. The owner of this bar knew exactly what they were doing when they opened this place. The atmosphere is cozy & intimate, yet inviting and down to earth. The staff is incredible and I can't wait to return!! Please bring a chill bar like this to North Carolina.",

    "text": "Actually 3.5 Stars--  We came the morning of New Years Day. The restaurant seemed full, but not packed. We were quickly seated at the back patio, but from there it was a long wait. As you can imagine, we were a tad hungover from NYE partying the night before (this IS Vegas, after all), and to have to wait probably 10-20 minutes before even getting water is terrible. We were actually served our bloody marys and Dirty Girl Scout ($8.00) before our water, which on any other morning might be acceptable.  Service was SLOW, but apologetic. Our waitress actually said she'd never seen the restaurant this busy before... but there wasn't a wait at the door, there didn't appear to be any large parties.. they were simply under staffed, which on a New Years morning is either bad management, or 1/2 their crew didn't show up for work.  Now, the food: WOW, very nicely done! The bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo $10.00) were GREAT, actually, served in a large mason jar with cucumbers and large basil leaves, spicy, no salt on the rim (not needed). So right away I was feeling relief from the wait and my headache, and starving stomach...  We got the fried Mac n Cheese balls ($7.00) for an appetizer. The were nice and hot, although we didn't cheese-burn the roof of our mouths, which is amazing. Crispy fresh batter, very thick cheese inside, with a size of cheese for dipping. 5 cheese balls total, each a bit larger than a golf ball, smaller than a tennis ball...  Then the food: I ordered the Breakfast Sandwich ($11.00), with eggs, bacon and cheese on bread. Simple enough, this was delicious! The eggs over easy actually seemed like the BEST eggs over easy I've ever experienced... maybe I was just that hungover/ starving, but I don't think I've ever tasted a better egg. The bread was almost like French Toast, fluffy, lightly toasted, soaking up the grease. The sandwich was very greasy, but I devoured it quickly and happily.  Friends ordered the Breakfast Waffle ($10.00) and the BBQ Texas Burger ($10.00).  Prices all around are a bit steep, but the quality of the food really shows with each bite. If only service were faster! But as I said, they were very apologetic and doing their best to reach everyone and serve a fantastic meal. A paid parking lot is around the corner. Patio seating in front and back of the restaurant, a small bar and dining area inside.   ***Another note: the ambiance is great. Outdoor seating with christmas lights in the trees, very good, hip art on the walls. Perfect for millennial hipsters (meaning to be only slightly patronizing! *** Really though, kudos to the scene!",

We sat done outside towards the front (that's the only place you can sit if you have a baby with you). Although it was okay because we had a front-row view of all Downtown. Good thing we went when the temperature wasn't too high, so it was nice to enjoy an outside table. But for the Vegas heat, it might get unpleasant to sit outside during the Summer. (The employees were great and moved umbrellas for us so the sun wouldn't hit our table).  The drinks were ahhhmazing! Their sangria was delicious:) and let me tell you about their food it was EVEN BETTER! I ordered a Philly Mac and cheese steak; my friends ordered French toast and a salad. All which were very delicious.   I definitely recommend this place! Hopefully next time I go I'll make it all the way towards the back. I heard they have a see saw back there!",

But along with all those new venues comes droves of hipsters almost as intolerable to me as the droves of tourists on the Strip, so I tend to visit this area during the day for lunch and weeknights. My impatience aside, the downtown area needs great food to go with its great bars, so I was very excited to hear that the new Park on Fremont was going to be serving more than just snacks. Billed as a gastro-pub, this recently abused word suggests a fancy array of snacks and main dishes to go along with a large drink menu. But can this suggestion truly become a reality?  Park has recently opened, taking over the failed 18+ hookah lounge that was there previously in a prime location on the corner of East Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. It sits alongside another neighborhood newcomer Radio City Pizza, and all of the other popular First Friday spots that have quickly taken over the scene with long pretentious lines to get in. I hate waiting to get in to places on the Strip, this new development of ropes and lines on Fremont is a bit much, even as 'cool' as some of these places might be. The interior of Park is quite odd, and I'm not quite sure how to explain it. Striking wall coverings, cool art, and stuffed birds decorate the interior dining and bar area, with a small patio up front and a large outdoor 'park' in the back complete with an adult teeter totter and plenty of lights. I went during the day so the inside was more than fine, although I'm sure the outdoor area in the back looks much better at night. While their menu has some interesting sounding items, it's kind of all over the place and I've heard most sound better than they actually taste. Options like a fried chicken and waffle sandwich, Philly mac and cheese steak and a corned beef Reuben all sound tasty, if not unhealthy.  Either way, I'm not here to report second hand information, I'm here to tell you about my burger experience. And in this case, it's their stuffed burger with Monterey jack and cheddar, and applewood bacon. Upon picking it up I bit into my dry bun with a really cold spot in the center where the pickles were sitting. What's with all the cold buns lately? The meat had no decent flavor on its own; it wasn't bad but it wasn't seasoned or presumably anything special. There was surprisingly some pink to the meat, which is a rare sight for a stuffed burger given how much longer they usually have to be cooked, although given the unknown quality of the meat I'm not sure if this is a good thing. The bacon inside was soggy and took away from any cheese or onion flavors, which weren't anything too great either. The lettuce, tomato and onion on top were fresh and ok, but overall there was nothing special about this burger which was surprisingly dry despite being stuffed with so much.  The fries were nothing special either; of the larger cut variety, but soggy and barely at room temperature. It seems like the reports I've heard are True: everything here looks way better than it actually is, which is surely unfortunate as I really want everything that opens in this particular area to be great. Still, I'm sure it will do just fine as this food is probably more than acceptable for the drunk crowd that takes over East Fremont all weekend. Just not for the overly critical like myself. $12 for a stuffed burger and fries is a reasonable price, I just wouldn't recommend it when you have better options close by at Triple George and newly opened La Comida (review for their really good burger coming next week).",

I don't know what kind of seasoning they put on the meat but it was the bees knees!!! The fries were sooo good and they have these teeter tots that I'm sure are sweet potatoes with cinnamon! The cinnamon was a surprise when we first bit into it but it was a good one! I forgot our waiters name but she was great; very attentive and she always came back to check up on us. They have some really good drinks and they come in mason jars!! The restaurant is a nice little hipster shack with a nice vibe. And while you're eating you can enjoy people watching!",

    "text": "Here's a small geography lesson about our fair city: There is \"The Strip\" and there is \"Downtown\". They are not the same place and the cultures are completely different. The Strip is what most people think of when they think of Vegas: Showy, glamourous, bright lights, etc, but Downtown has been undergoing a quiet revival in the last few years. Sure it still has the marks of \"old Vegas\" and has yet to be completely cleaned up or even gentrified, but it's become home to some drinking establishments that are actually pretty unique, my favourite among them being one of the newer kids on the block, Park on Fremont. Situated in the hip and trendy East Fremont district, which is home to many bars, Park on Fremont is a grand exercise in the power of kitsch and how awesome it looks and feels. Not only is it one of the only watering holes in the area that is open during the day, but it's also got a pretty good food menu, decent drinks and a wonderful atmosphere. In fact, it's a great place to go if you want to feel like you're not really in Vegas at all.  Things of note: The gigantic, and incredibly authentic, Mark Ryden painting, $20 bottomless mimosas for Sunday brunch (and we all know how I love my mimosas), the hidden teeter totter out on the patio.  Make sure to try: $10 beer and a shot menu, Pillow Talk.",

The cocktails are quite nice - I certainly enjoyed the simple vodka cocktail, the Unicorn, I was served - though putting everything in mason jars is a bit of a tired hipster contrivance.  Service was friendly but slow, though the waiter was clearly doing his best - the staff to table ratio is probably a bit out of whack here.  I hope that this place comes to its senses and strives for a more ambitious culinary effort.

It is a rectangular shaped building with the bar on the left side and booths on the right side to sit in.  There is an outdoor area that I would have liked to check out, but with the heat breaking temps on that May day in 2018 (I think it was 103 which was record breaking for that particular day) - we decided to sit inside. Which.... we found out very quickly was probably almost as bad as sitting outside.  To make a long story short - there was NO AIR CONDITIONING.  Now, if it is an old building and that is part of the charm ok ok I see.  However, there were also NO FANS.  It was devastatingly uncomfortable!  I am definitely torn on the review! I would have given 2 stars based solely on that.  If it was a total comfort atmosphere in the cooler months - it may have easily been a 4 star!  Because service was good.  Food was decent - the only real standout was the baked macaroni bites - wow Delicious!  They were a little spicy and I could not figure out what was making them that way.  I do not usually like spice, but these really were the perfect little bites.  Happy hour had good prices and variety of food.  I would definitely check this place out on a NOT HOT day.  It just isn't fun eating (especially spicy) food while your legs are sticking to the seats and there is just stagnant hot air around you.",

We have literally talked about how great our food was everyday since we've been back home and how we can't wait to go again. We both got the chicken sandwich and I can't even begin to explain all the flavors everything about it was perfect. I asked for the coleslaw on the side since I'm not a fan of my foods mixing but I ended up trying it on the sandwich and OMG AMAZING!! All the servers were so friendly and the atmosphere was great! Looking forward to coming back again hopefully soon!",

I didn't partake in any of the cocktails due to a later arrangement I had that night (will update next time). The burger I ordered was fat and juicy, satisfied my craving for the day. Cool seating, and friendly staff. Will return.",

I've come here and never noticed they had an outside =O I wondered how they did business with such a small inside haha.  In the back is just a beautiful court yard. So intimate and quiet it was amazing. The server who took care of us was really nice. He let us know all the happy hour items and let us know when happy hour was almost over. We got a few rounds of drinks and some fried pickles. I was full from the place before but these fried pickles were great. The batter was seasoned well and the batter didn't fall off the pickles like most places. Could've ate two orders.  Just the relaxing environment of this place outside next to a fire place at night was amazing. I really appreciate the heaters outside for night time. That's big for an outside place. Vegas gets cold too especially at night.  Try this place! Plus behind the seating is an adult seesaw ;) got play!",

It was pretty empty inside, maybe they just opened, not sure but I sat at the bar and drank a beer (yeah, breakfast, oh well). The menu looked good and I ordered a egg and bacon sandwich and those tots! Everything was absolutely delicious. I needed food bad so my bar was a little low as any food woulda helped me if you know what I mean.  But it literally was excellent and I will return next month when I'm back in town. :-)",

Seating is comfortable inside & outside on the sidewalk patio or the garden patio. The beer offers lots of selections. Service is friendly, punctual, and efficient.  So why the one star rating? The food is consistently mediocre, but today's meal was the worst. I ordered the bacon cheeseburger medium well, served protien style, and not only was it burnt but the cheese was black. And the inside was raw.    The only reason I didnt send it back was because it felt like we were intruding & wasting their space even though we were the only table for over an hour. The buser took my silverware before I was done using the fork so I couldn't even eat the bacon, the waitress took my plate before I was even halfway done eating the sweet potato tots (which were delicious).   Sadly, I recommend skipping food & enjoying a drink.",

    "text": "If you ever went to Absinthe during the first run, you've seen this type of decor. Mismatched indoor furniture - but outdoors, Haunted Mansion -esq paintings, string lights, and of course, the hipster holy grail: MASON JARS. If Peaches Geldof came back from the grave to design an eatery around her favorite Pinterest board, it would be Park on Fremont.  I've been to PoF 4 times. The biggest issue (other than the pentagram in the bathrooms, which is a huge turn off to even patronizing this place) is that it is so sunny outdoors. Okay, I get that it's cool to have an outdoor seating area, but it's Vegas and it is sweltering a huge chunk of the year. I've seen others who are already eating, pounce on unbused tables in the shade once people get up to leave. I've done it as well. Having to shield your eyes as you eat and sweat just isn't enjoyable. If there were more umbrellas, or even a semi permeable awning of some sort, it'd go a long way to making outdoor dining enjoyable.   Honestly, come during happy hour. The prices are significantly cheaper and the portions are the same. Make sure you check what is covered under the HH menu, drink wise, because I've paid $8 for a well drink that I assumed would be less than $3 based on the special at the time. The 1 lb of chicken wings for $5 and the garbage fries are really the only things I'd recommend. They're delicious. Skip the chicken & waffles which is heavy on the carbs, and lacking in flavor.   Service varies from the attentive, to having to go inside to ask where the check is after waiting, waiting, waiting. I've even ordered drinks that never came (and thus I didn't pay for them.) Whatever, PoF's loss.   If it weren't for the HH chicken wings, the egg topped garbage fries and the fun see saw out back, I wouldn't recommend this place. Oh, and even if you wear flip flops, be careful. Inside, the floors are significantly uneven and I've nearly face planted due to this safety hazard.",

I came in here briefly for a few drinks after dinner at Vegenation and fell \"in like\" with the decor and style of the bar, from the old timey wallpaper to the M-16 Deer antler showpiece on the wall.   I didn't partake in any of the Taco Tuesday festivities, but the food looked very good and the you can't beat one dollar Dos Equis, even if it's the eight ounce bottles.   Park on Fremont offers a large variety of craft beers; Magic hat, Dogfish Head, Ballast Point, and the list goes on. Plus a small, but decent arrangement of whiskeys, my poison for the evening was Knob Creek, Straight Rye. Perfect after dinner drink.   This bar is definitely worth another trip, if not just for another cocktail, but the menu. I mean deep fried mac n' cheese balls!   PRO-TIP: On the patio, beyond the wall. There's a secret seesaw",

Unfortunately she did give us some bad news:  The secret menu item: Lobster Sliders are no longer served. We had seen them on Adam Richmond's secret menu item show on the Travel Channel  and we were really looking forward to devouring them-POO!  We settled on the Mac n Cheese balls $8 and the Chicken n Waffle Sammie $13.  The Mac n Cheese balls were golf ball sized scoops of panko crusted, deep fried mac n cheese with jalapeno and bacon too boot.  One bite of that crispy, creamy goodness and we were transported to mac n cheese heaven.  My wife doesn't even like mac n cheese and I was forced to share them with her cuz they were that darn good LMAO!  The chicken and waffle sammie holds two deep fried chicken breasts and a healthy portion of crispy bacon.  I am not a fan of chicken and waffles but this concoction was still pretty tasty.  We were sorely tempted to come back and try the garbage fries and burgers here, but we didn't get a chance to make it back.  Next trip we will definitely be back.",

Staff was dressed casually, our server talked to us straight forward, nothing came across as \"scripted\" as would happen at other places.  My wife ate what was called \"garbage.\" Let me type that again, my wife ate what was called \"garbage.\" They are described as \"Our house made fries layered with melted cheddar and provolone cheese and covered with bacon, jalapenos, green onions, tomatoes, chipotle peppers, avocados and topped with fried egg.\" My wife took the jalapenos off.  I ordered the Chicken Bar Bites which are cornflake crusted boneless chicken tenders served plain or tossed in your choice of sauce. Honey Mustard, Buffalo, Chipotle BBQ. Our server brought eight small containers, each filled with sauces.   The food however just didn't \"wow\" us, which is why I didn't give a 5 star rating. While we were eating a large group of people, 20-24 individuals I would say. Came in through the front door, and walked through the restaurant towards the patio dining area in the back. I thought to myself what a large party this is. Not 5 minutes later the same group of people, LEFT right out the front door. Turns out this group of people are a tourist group that WALKS through various restaurants. Great publicity for Park On Fremont. But I would be starving after \"a tour.\"  This place is not for children... look at the pictures.  This place is unique to say the least. In closing I would just like to say, thanks for reading, and that I'm done with this review.\"",

When I was at the bar, service was ok but when there were several of us at a table, service suffered.  It took quite a while to get the sever to take our drink orders, a while for it to arrive, and then we were all basically dry glassed wiating for her to return so we could order  more and some food.  If you've got plenty of time to sit and chat then that isn't going to be an issue but don't go if you want to get in and out during happy hour or dinner time.  I cannot speak to lunch since I have not tried that here yet.",

It's always crowded in here which is awesome. I'm always running into friends here and have never had a bad time here for the past 3 years!

We moved to a shadier spot much to the chagrin and in-your-face eye roll of our hostess.   The atmosphere on the back patio is great, by the way. It'd be even better if they cleaned the dried bird shit off the tables.   Anyway, 15-20 minutes later a server finally appeared to bring us water. The actual taking of orders happened a little later.   I ordered the steak and eggs skillet, which was quite tasty. It would've been even better if it hadn't come 30 minutes after rest of my group's meals. It was unceremoniously dropped on the table with no apology or thanks for patience. Also, they serve steak and have no steak knives. Seriously!?   My partner ordered the chicken and waffles, which I'm pretty sure they pulled out of the frozen food section at Smith's. There's no way that chicken is hand-breaded in the restaurant.   Getting the check took our server another 20 minutes.    I can see where this might be a cool place for evening drinks and some light bites. But for brunch or any actual meal, it's really shitty.",

One person in our group suggested we go in here for a few post- dinner drinks, and I'm so glad we did. We sat at the outside bar section, which was really nice, it was a cool night and a little bit less hectic outside than inside. I'm all for fresh air so whenever I have a chance to partake in food or beverage and mix it with fresh air I'm a big fan!  I had a few vodka waters, the bartender made them quite delicious! I know it sounds simple but this is a drink that can easily be made poorly, either with too much vodka or too much water. These were perfect, mixed with that fresh air and good company... I truly had a great time at this place!  Then, the icing on the cake is that there is a teeter totter around back!! It's in a really small area, but I sure am glad they fit in this awesome little piece of playground equipment. Just make sure you don't have too many drinks when you partake in this fun LOL. Playing on the teeter totter was great! I was laughing my butt off while getting to play on this piece of equipment that reminded me of my childhood, except now it was an adult version with drinks!  My experience at Park on Fremont was a very fun one, I would definitely go there again!",

    "text": "Holy fried food, lots of fried food. Sought out the opinion of a friend who lives in Vegas for a place near Old Las Vegas where the 10 of us girls could go to dinner, while wearing our Bachelorette party tank tops and shorts and not break the bank. He suggested Park on Fremont and I took his word for it. Called first to see if they could accommodate 10 of us last minute and they said yes for the outside patio only. After walking in, there were a few tables scattered about inside, we checked out their outside and it wasn't for us, plus with the heat we wanted some air conditioning before heading back out into the desert dry heat. Our server told us she could see part of our group and as more tables got up, we could eventually all sit together. We were starving so we went with that option. Four of us sat down at a table and ordered some food to pick on so that our friends who weren't seated yet could come over and nibble what we had ordered too. Lots of fried stuff, which was unfortunate because after all of the booze we were drinking all weekend, it would have been nice to see some healthy food but anyways!  We got the crispy brussels sprouts, lots of oil but definitely delicious, sweet potato tater tots, also delicious. We got fried pickles, this intense plate of waffles fries, bacon and everything else unhealthy, mac and cheese balls. Fried junk basically, they call it comfort food for a reason. For the meal I went with the free bird, which was a turkey burger topped with some guacamole and arugula. I didn't love it, the flavor was a little off for me, but then again rarely do I find restaurants to do a turkey burger right. The annoyance came in when the bill was dropped. The server let the bride pay and that's just a no no. Clearly, she's in a veil, the only chick wearing white, maybe ask one of the bridesmaids first before letting her pay. The other girls didn't love the place, again we weren't looking for a fried food spread, maybe you'll love it though. Cool interior.",

    "text": "I went here for brunch about a month ago and I really enjoyed it.  The only downside (why I gave it 4/5 instead of 5/5) was it says it opens at 11am and a crowd of people were waiting to get in and they opened around 10-15 minutes late. If you open at 11am then you should be ready to take customers at 11am. If you aren't ready at the correct time then change your hours.   I think the thing I enjoyed the most was the prices of the cocktails. I feel a lot of other restaurants downtown charge so much for a drink ($14-$18) while Park charged around $18 for a pitcher of their sangria or mimosas.   We decided to first order a pitcher of sangria. There was three of us and we all got around 2 drinks per person.   We then decided to switch it up to mimosas. For this they bring a crate of orange juice and a whole bottle of champagne which is cooled in what looks like a summer lunch bag. I feel for what we paid it was a great deal. We ended up leaving some of the champagne because we all had to drive shortly thereafter. It also made us very sleepy.   For my entree I decided to get the Chilaquiles which were very yummy and I finished them in no time.  We all also want to try the French toast so instead of ordering that as an entree we all decided to get it as dessert. I'm love doing this at restaurants so then you order something that fills you up and something that is a little sweet. The french toast was good and was a great end to your meal.  If you decide to come here for brunch I suggest coming here right at 11am when it opens or have reservations. It is small and the space fills quickly. There also aren't a lot of tables inside and on a hot summer day you do not want to be outside if you do not have to be.",

    "text": "The funny thing about 3 stars in that there must be SOME redeeming quality about the place that you rated it halfway, and heck, even took the time to rate it. Also, this review is for daytime service & food, not what it turns into at night.  The food isn't that special. At least it's not super expensive. The drinks are pretty good, fond of the beermosa and grapefruit beer. Mimosa brunch is kind of a joke, but I come from LA where mimosa brunch is a dime a dozen. I don't get how mimosa brunching is not a thing in Vegas...? They fill a 6 oz mason jar about halfway with your mimosa and our server took her sweet ass time coming back refills. What happened to leaving the carafe of OJ and the bottle of champagne on the table? We flagged down 3 different servers to grab us our 5th refill (prob the equivalent of our 2nd glass) and when our actual server came back she was like oh they already brought them! And we said we would gladly take the second one! (since y'all were sleepin on it). And this mimosa brunch is crazy expensive too, $20 for bottomless? I haven't found anything in Vegas cheaper than $15 for bottomless - out of control.   Those 3 stars represent decor and the fact there are 2 outside patios. I also kinda like how the inside is just essentially big hallway (with tables and a bar) that you walk through. There aren't really doors. Lame to like, but True. Everyone loves the back patio, and the see-saw. There was also live music when we went on Sunday afternoon around 2pm, which was nice.",

Another reviewer mentioned the same people owned Commonwealth which explains the Mark Ryden paintings at both places. The decor overall was interesting if not a bit busy. Like it was trying too hard. The waitress was friendly and helpful, if not a bit new to the place.   When you're out on the patio, don't hesitate to go around the north wall. There's a small, easy-to-miss, path on the left and there's a small bar-like seating area and... a mothafuckin' teeter-totter! You're welcome.",

The indoor seating is very limited, but there are plenty of tables outside- in the front and back.  I find the decor very interesting...country meets hipster.   There is always a great drink special, $10 for a shot and beer (I go with a Dos Equis and a shot of Patron).  Also, the fried pickles are AMAZING.  And I'm a pickle enthusiast :)",

Even though the menu is short, it had many items to choose from.  I ordered one of their bloody marys (Texas Tuxedo) to start the night off along with some healthy dishes - chicken wrap & a strawberry salad.  Each of my friends ordered something different, that way we can try out more items on the menu to see what their BEST dish is.  Their steak salad was definitely more delicious than the strawberry salad.  The mac n' cheese philly cheese steak was very interesting.  Yes, very fattening and yummy!  One thing I would do differently (just because I'm really into texture) I would bake some Panko on top of the mac n' cheese to make it have a crununnnnccchhh :)  Their nachos was different.  They placed the steak flank and egg separately on the side of the chips.  I think for the night my favorite was their steak salad :P       I love their back patio!! You don't feel like you're in Vegas.  There are just random stuff all over to look at and take pictures with/of.  I love the greenery and the lightings of the place.  It makes the ambiance of the place very relax and refreshing.  Btw, where else can you find adult see-saw!? lol",

Our food came quickly, with no water/ drinks. I had to go to the bar and ask for a  couple waters myself. Still the waitress did not stop to drop of any of our beverages. We finished our food, shortly after our drinks finally came! So I decide to ask for the check. Waited for about 10 minutes. Still no sign of the waitress. Again I had to go get the something for myself.  Definitely great for a self service restaurant dining experience.",

When I made the reservations I told them I wanted the back patio because we had a child with us and they would not be confined to a table and would be able to move around a little bit.. They sent me a confirmation to confirm my reservation through Yelp which I confirmed. When we arrive we walked to the hostess desk and they greeted us by name without us telling them who we were. Then they proceeded to tell us that minors were not allowed in the restaurant. I find it ironic did they knew who we were when we walked up without us telling them but they didn't have the courtesy or decency to call us ahead of time and tells us was a mistake with the reservation and they don't allow children. It's not like it was 8 9 or 10 at night it was 6 p.m. which is a basic dinner time. Avoid this place at all costs!  Go.across the straight to the smashed Pig.",

    "text": "Go here to see, be seen and hang out on a patio. Of course, hanging out on a patio is done best with a cold, adult beverage, so also go here to drink.   I have been here twice, and the reason for my second visit honestly wasn't because I just had to have some fabulous dish again, it was because my pals that live downtown were hanging out on the patio, and I was jealous. I knew I was probably going to miss something (like Tony Hsieh delivering happiness in person or a Jesus Jam Band on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd) if I didn't go. So, I went, and therefore, did not miss either of those things, both of which actually happened.   The patio offering at Park On Fremont is without doubt in a class of luxury. You can sit out front and watch Fremont Street in all its glory, or you can head out back and go for the Secret Garden experience. Both options have their time and their place. Try both.   As for the drink offerings, I am excited to see they offer variations of the Bloody Mary! Granted, I haven't tried them, but I think it's an art form we don't have enough of in Vegas. They also have a nice beer list, but mostly in cans/bottles, and on my first visit, they didn't have 30% of the list. I think it was because they were still in soft opening mode, so I won't hold it against them.   As for the food, it is a bit underwhelming. Portion sizes are small, and although the menu is a list of delicious potential, dishes are just a little bit less than you hoped for in size and presentation. Everything I have tried tastes good, and I do appreciate that they have a variety of options, including vegetarian, and just the fact that they have food!  So, I don't think I would go here with a starved foodie (at least not yet), but for a night downtown, it's definitely the happening spot to get your drink and patio on.",

    "text": "You gotta love places like Park on Fremont because of what they are trying to do: Revamp an area and make cool what once was not so cool. I have to give them mad respect, just for that fact.  Owned by the same folks who own Commonwealth, this nifty little place has all the right elements to make it stand out as a contender amongst the other places popping up Downtown. They have not been open very long, so they might get more stars later on in an update if things change. But as it sits right now, I would have to say, \"come for the patio, stay for the unique beer choices.\"  The front and back patios are both great, but each one has a different vibe. The back is more chill, bigger and prettier. There is a smoking area with a see-saw and cool plants and flowers all over the place. It's a nice little reprieve from the craziness of Fremont St.  Ambiance inside is really cool, with a trendy and artsy sort of vibe. The front patio is louder, there are more people milling about, and you get to watch all the \"Fremont Freaks and Geeks\" wave their crazy flag proudly! I'm not hatin', I'm one of them!  The beer list is pretty extensive for a smaller place like this. They have everything from Coors and Mickey's Malt Liquor, to Young's Double Chocolate Stout and Lost Coast Sacramento Blonde. Honestly, you almost start wishing they sold beer flights so you could try a little bit of everything.  There is a cool \"beer and a shot\" combo option on the drink menu, which always seems like a fun concept, if you are in to that sort of thing.  One element I have not been so enthralled with is the food. The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots are really funky, but in a good way! The sweet mustard dipping sauce they include with 'em really adds that extra \"yum\" factor.  But a few of the dishes I have tried were just sorta ok. The first time I visited, I tried to order the Grilled Cheese on Brioche, which sounded to die for. It was 86'ed, which was fine, because it was their grand opening week and they had just had their soft open right before, so they had run out of a bunch of things. Not a big deal. I'll get it next time :)  Instead, I tried the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, which was pretty tasty.   But the second time I visited, I was sad to see that they had taken that grilled cheese off entirely!! Sad, sad day. So I chose the Veggie Wrap, which came in a tortilla-type of casing.  It was just \"Eh.\" Kinda greasy, which sometimes is good, but not in this case. Not enough melted cheese, and not enough feta crumbles. Plus, the veggies were kinda wet.... Overall, it's been a little hit-and-miss with the food here. I'm confident it will more likely than not get better over time. Maybe I'm just being picky, or perhaps I have ordered the wrong things. Only time and more visits will tell.  But still come here! Sit at the patio! Especially out front. If you are a lady, you will get a couple creepy homeless dudes mackin' on you. Be prepared. And don't keep your phone or wallet on the side of the table closest to the fence, because someone could just run by and grab it. The nice thing is they do have a security guy standing by the front, just in case.",

I considered sending the fries back for the toast,  but since it took so long to get the first order,  I thought better of it.  Eventually we got the check.  I was eating with my brother,  so I we handed him our cards and asked him to split the check.  When we got our credit card receipts it was immediately obvious he just split the total cost of our bill in half.  We got different things that were different prices.  If two people are eating together and ask to split their check,  I think it's obvious how they want that done.    TL;DR The food was just okay.  The service was just silly and not good.  Try La Thai instead.  It's right across the street.",

    "text": "A place that has multiple styles of BLOODY MARYS?!?! Can I move in!!? THANK YOU PARK ON FREMONT! It really is aboout time someone made a great version, or 5, of my favorite drink. I had been wanting to try this place knowing it was the sister of Commonwealth, but after reading Misti Y.'s review and learning of the drink menu I knew I had to get here ASAP!  They have a few seating options, front patio- (you can see everyone walking down Fremont GREAT people watching). Inside- (dim, bar, tables, booth and awesome photography all over). Back Patio (garden, cool yet strange decor, secret hidden area with a seesaw that you can actually use). The only downfall to the back patio is the scent of trash. They are in the back alley and the dumpster makes its appearance known. They try to hide the scent by burning incense but it doesn't do it 100%. The drinks are $10 each, with the exception of one bloody mary that comes with bacon and an egg. That one is $12.  I tried 2 different versions. The first was the Texas Tuxedo infused with cucumber and basil. It was more refreshing than your average mary. The second was a Lady Cave which was pretty much a classic served with celery and I added olives.  I will be risky next time and try the whiskey mary. Didn't want to mix my liquors too early on this trip.  Food was 3 outta 5 stars. I had the hammered chicken which was a chicken salad with baby greens, candied nuts and either blue or goat cheese I truly cant remember. Probably because there was so little of it in my salad. It was mostly chicken and lettuce and the chicken was a tad dry.  My bf got the ruben, and it was basic but good.  I want to come back and sit inside and on the front patio so I can experience everything. Also I have heard they have a few new menu items and I have a feeling this place will only improve. Can't wait to come try the rest of the drinks and grub!",

When it comes down to it the food is overpriced for the portion sizes and there's little to nothing special about it that hasnt been done before...at a third the price....for double the size.   Presentation is second to none as well. If you're ordering a burger, or in my case the chicken wrap, what you'll get is your wrap on a tray with side of choice and the smallest disposable ramekin of i guess honey mustard.   The drink menu could use some revision...pricing for one. A wipe down with some disinfectant spray for others.  Yeah not impressed. With all the other options on fremont street offering the same drinks for a fraction of the price...unlike you find everything pleasing i wouldnt recommend.   Yelp 100 - 033 of 100",

    "text": "I can't think of one experience about Park as I've been coming here at least every weekend since the joint opened.  I LOVE PARK!  FINALLY, an outside beer garden downtown :)  When you arrive, the building has an exposed, dark, weathered wood look to it.  There's outside seating in the front of the restaurant, a few high top tables and bar area inside and a lot more table seating in the back garden.  It's definitely a great concept and once the misters are working, the back section will be great for the hot summer coming up!  The staff are always super nice and friendly.  I love the uniforms:  chambray tops and red TOMS for the girls and nice bow ties and other dapper accents for the guys.  Super trendy.  Every time I hang out there, I end up getting a lot of stuff and having a lot of questions.  The staff are all very patient which I appreciate.  For Drinks:  They have A LOT of beers.  A LOT!  I love the options.  You have the regular Coors lights, Coronas and Guinnesses.  They also have other eclectic options like the banana bread beer and my favorite, the grapefruit beer!  HIGHLY RECOMMEND :)  The prices range from $5-$10 depending on the beer.  I also highly recommend the Unicorn, a mixed drink that includes a lot of Ginger.  Ginger beer!  Finally, my other favorite option is the pick a beer and shot for $10.  It's a list of about 5 beers and 5 shots.  I usually get the Guinness and Fireball Whiskey shot with this deal.    For Food:  The Bar Bites for $8 is AH-MAZE-ING!  Corn flake crusted chicken tenders over fries or tater tots.  Then there's the sweet potato tots!  OMG, they serve it with a honey mustard dipping sauce.  You can also ask for a sriracha ketchup but please be advised:  NO ranch or regular ketchup is offered at all!  I also love the chicken and waffle sandwich for $10.  The chicken is crusted with Capt 'n Crunch, between waffles and drizzled with Wild Turkey maple syrup.  Also served with either fries or tots.  The popular and only sides are the fries, tots or potato salad for $4 each.  The potato salad is creamy and full of soft potato chunks.    As you can see from my review, I've visited this place enough to know a few great meals.  I definitely invite you to check this place out.  It's the first business welcoming you into Fremont East.  It'll not only show you how great downtown is transforming into, but it'll also show you how wonderful this place really is.  Check them out :)",

It was a cold-ass weekend in Vegas and stopped in to warm up. Even though all their doors/windows were open it was cozy inside. Comfy too. All banquet and booths down one side. The patio in the front and back look very inviting but it was a bit too cold out for my wimpy self. I'll be back when it gets warmer.   Love Moscow Mules and Mojitos? Have a Unicorn. It's a tasty cocktail that slips down a treat. Had more than a few of these. On a brunchy kind of day definitely try a passionfruit bellini. Way better than a standard mimosa. Saw a few people around us order their spiked coffees. Did I mention it was crazy cold out last weekend?   Their food menu is super tasty comfort food. I wanted to try everything. We had delicious chipotle bbq wings. For brunch had a monty Cristo sandwich. Husband has avo toast (we're so Cali) and really enjoyed it.   The decor is hipster cool. Love the huge Mark Ryden painting in the back - lots of people stopped to snap a photo. Super chill vibe when we visited. I'll be back when it's warmer and can check out the patio.",

What makes it 1 star:  We waited 30 minutes for our food for lunch when there was only one other table there. We were told that we had another table ahead of us when we asked at the 20 minute mark, and then had to clarify if the food was even being started on or waiting until after the other table was served.   When we were given the checks a little earlier because they knew we had to be somewhere, we still had to be the ones to get up and go to the cashier while the waitress played on her phone at the bar. And even before she'd take us, she had to take another table's order first.   When we left the tables of the people who came after us were already getting their food. They seem to get held up if there's a big order.   And then what really prompted this review was that all throughout there was no thank you, sorry for the wait, come back again, etc. From any of the workers around the bar or going through the restaurant.   To their credit, they came back to give us the side salad when they made the mistake of doing fries instead for one of our orders.   For the food being what it is, it would not be worth coming back for. Especially knowing how long the wait is and how lacking the customer service is.",

So WHY not tell people it's 100 degrees inside instead of making me throw out my water and then serve tap water with NO ice??? We will NEVER go back again! Manager didn't ever care, he offered for us to sit outside, where it was 103 degrees!! Pathetic!!!",

Once I arrived later and they had closed their kitchen early (it was a weeknight and slow) and the other time we literally got to the door and friends sent a text and we had to leave to meet them. Third time was a charm though, and we spent some time on a sunny Friday afternoon here enjoying drinks and a nibble...  This place came on my radar when another friend who also loves Vegas raved that I \"had to try\" their Garbage Fries. It's been on my list for over two years now, and it exceeded expectations.  We had our Garbage Fries as tots... and they were game changing. The best \"fries\" I think I have ever had. Melted cheddar. Melted provolone. Bacon. Fresh cut Jalapenos. Fresh Tomatoes. Avacado. Chipoltle Ranch. A sunny side up Fried Egg. All piled on and large serving of perfectly fried tater tots. We were in heaven, and actually full after sharing one plate of these as an afternoon snack.  They had some great beers on tap (which I enjoyed a couple of pints of... Kronenbourg 1664 and a Ballast Point Scullpin) and Heather loved her  \"Bucking Mules\".. Moscow Mules. We sat in the sun on the patio facing Fremont Street, enjoying the fact we weren't back home in the never ending -20 degree Celsius weather.     The next time we visit (and there will most definitely be a visit next time were in Vegas) we want to sit on the beautiful back patio area, or inside where the artwork is so damn cool and interesting. This is just a great spot with incredible food and great staff. Their swag is awseome too... just may need to grab a tshirt next time!",

I don't eat bacon, so the chef was nice enough to swap it with turkey. Kelsey was our server and made our experience incredible: great conversationist, impeccable service, & made us feel like the restaurant was ours. Servers like her are the reason why the restaurant has the vibe and life that it does & why we keep coming back.",

    "text": "I have been here twice, once for breakfast and another time pub crawling Fremont.  Both different experiences but I can mix it up if needed!  On my most recent visit, which was last night, we were pub crawling on Repeal Day, the end of prohibition. There were five of us and we saddled up to the bar where we all ordered cocktails and bar food. The atmosphere is quite alright with a mix of locals and tourists.   We ordered the fried pickles, which we shared and the $2 Tacos on Taco Tuesday special. The tacos were good for $2 tacos on Fremont street in a trendy bar. There are two choices of beef or chicken, we ordered one of each for three people.  Like I said, it was bar food nothing extravagant!  The breakfasts are very good actually. Breakfast places in Vegas are kind of weird for locals and I am sure weirder for tourists. There are wonderful places off the Strip or away from downtown Vegas but if you happen to be in the downtown area you may want to check out Park on Freemont. It is not inside a casino so you do not have to go through anxiety just to find it and then settle on a buffet. It is pretty much on the corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd. If the weather is good there is outside seating in the front and back. The breakfasts are creative and fun, see my photos. All was yummy and to be able to sit back and chill in the morning is a pretty sweet deal from the casino or chain restaurant alternative.  Don't forget to have a go on the park like teeter totter that is in the way back behind the wall. They don't call it Park on Fremont street for nothing!",

This restaurant should make this VERY CLEAR when you make the reservation that outside is a very real possibility. Needless to say...we left, and I was ticked because I didn't like the way the matter was handled, and it could have been avoided had they simply reached out to me.   Not too mention I was disappointed because I was looking forward to eating hear because of the reviews. So my initial review wasn't the nicest, but I have had a few email exchanges with the restaurant so I will amend my review and say \"Call and make your reservation and make it clear about whether you are inside or out\"!",

If you had to order one thing off the menu...hands down get the Mac and Cheese balls.  In one ball you get a flavorful Mac & Cheese with ground bacon rolled in a breaded fried tasty treat.

Before we go dance the night away at Commonwealth or Inspire, we always make sure to stop by for some drinks! Besides tequila shots, Pillowtalk is my second favorite drink! It's so refreshing, and soooo good! Omg, I want one now!   Oh, and their Mac & Cheese balls are to die for! Crunchy, and so cheesy! Ughhhh. Did I mention how much I love this place?   Besides the amazing food, drinks, and atmosphere, Park has a really cute area in the back where you can enjoy the goodies! It's probably my favorite section of the establishment - it's what gives the business their name. It's so cute!   It's a great setting for a first date or anyone wanting something casual, but romantic. With the amazing drinks, and park/picnic setting it's for sure to set the mood for a great night!   This little spot def deserves a two thumbs up!",

I came on new years Eve and it wasn't crowded, service was amazing and friendly and I thoroughly enjoyed my time.  The drink I had was to die for--I ordered the pillow talk and it came in a mason jar. I was so amused at the presentation and every little detail of their dishes. Fries came in an adorable tin pail, and the entire place looked straight out of a fairytale tavern in the woods.  Out back they have an adorable patio with lighted trees and a fireplace going. It's downright romantic if youre with a significant other. I really wish I had someone with me that night.  I'm sad that I won't be able to visit any time soon as I live in Hawaii but I hope they stay open for a long time so I can always come back :) Thanks for an amazing and chill NYE ^__^",

This place will not win the healthy eating award but will leave you full and satisfied. Great selection of beers and cocktails.   This place has a great vibe and is a perfect place to people watch if you can sit outside (November yes, middle of July, no way). Great location just off the main section of Fremont Street Experience.   Check this place out.   If you keep finding yourself going out of your way to visit a place when in town it deserves maximum rating. Another great eating experience today.",

I had a turkey burger that was super dry extremely bland.  I couldn't even finish 1/2 of it.  The guac spread that was in there was also bland and I was at least expecting that to be tasty.  Thought I could have dipped my fries in it.  My boy had wings. You can't go wrong with wings so I'll give them a star for that. Our waitress was really friendly but my rating isn't on the service.  It's based on the food. If you have time, go thru and check out the cool decor and garden and have a drink. But the food, meh! Especially for the price.",

I just haven't yet.   So this review is based on the place itself, the drinks and the service.  This place is adorable. I love the decor! I love the patio! It's so pretty, cute, morbid, Frenchy all rolled into an awesome ball that works. Every time I come, I discover something new. My favorite areas to note are the hall of chandeliers, the beautiful tile hopscotch, Cinderella's carriage (I pretend it's hers) and the teeter-totter in the smoking section (somewhat hidden in the back). I love bringing out-of-town friends here and they all love it.  I've tried a few of their house specialty drinks, and really I have no complaints. The drinks are good. Although sometimes they taste as if they don't have much alcohol in them. They have this pear beer, which is super tasty. I'm not a big beer drinker, so those of you that are, pay no attention to my beer recommendation!! Haha. But those of you that like fruity and crisp, and don't know crap about beer, try it.  The service is always quick and friendly.",

It has such a trendy vibe inside, full bar, and small dining area. But if you go outside, the feel of the vibe completly changes. Its more of a romantic backyard setting with umbrellas and if you peek over the wall by the fire place, there even  a small hangout area with a teeter totter.  The food was great. Huge portions too. I had ordered the chicken fingers from the appetizer section and it had about 6 fingers with french fries, that itself had me full. Usually you can choose what sauce you want it tossed in, but i asked for the buffalo on the side, and it also came with a side of ranch and ketchup. My friend ordered a burger which was massive and delicious. I wouldn't of been able to finish it.  But my favorite part of all was their signature mules. The one i ordered had berries in it.",

When reading the menu majority of the choices sound delicious, but in reality I find the food bland and not too exciting. This time eating I tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Sadly the chicken was dry and I only had a lonely strip of bacon. Honestly tasted a lot better separated than it did as a sandwich.   My friends ordered the fried egg burger, and typically the egg is over easy when it comes to these burgers. But in their case the egg was fully cooked, I'm not sure if that's something you have to clarify or not.   The bottomless mimosas were awesome, our server kept them coming without us having to ask for more. The drinks at Park are very good I must say. Nothing to complain about as for drinks.   I love DT and will most likely be at Park weekly, but more for the drinks than the food.",

The Park on Fremont was a great breath of fresh air, both for the atmosphere (actual wood) and the price (holy cow $5 for happy hour food?). The drinks were good, I can see how they would be seen as 'hipster,' but I got a mule and a beer and the mule was excellent.   The food. Oh, the food. Let me say now that if you are hammered and go here, eat to your hearts content. But beware the food portions can sneak up on you. For our first round my associate and I ordered wings and 'garbage' (read: nacho) fries with a fried egg on top. The fried egg alone made the fries seem like they were copulated in another universe. The wings were pretty good as well.   Our second round consisted of boneless wings (so we could try the sauces) and the deep-friend mac and cheese balls. We were way in over our heads.....within one portion of each we were tapping out faster than you could imagine. The fried mac and cheese balls were insane, amazing, I don't have any other words for it. I just wish I could have finished them all :\\  If I was forced to go to Las Vegas again you bet your behind I would go back to the park.",

I'm not sure if they were going for a theme with all that or just being quirky.  I had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich, and wasn't very impressed. It was messy and the waffles were soggy, so it was impossible to keep the chicken between the waffles. I had to remove some of the chicken to even get it in my mouth. There was something that I thought was ketchup served with the fries, but after it made my mouth feel a bit on fire, I realized that was definitely not ketchup.  The beer selection had quite a few local beers which is a plus, but was pretty small.",

    "text": "I have been to Park several times, and my experience is always similar. First the good stuff. I've never had a bad meal here, and the cocktails are delicious. My favorite cocktail is the Pillow Talk, which is a light and refreshing vodka drink. The food ranges from classic bar food to yummy salads, so no matter what kind of mood you're in, they have something for your tastes. The ambiance is very cool. This place was definitely designed by hipsters--it's quirky and fun. I'm also a huge sucker for a nice, outdoor space, and Park's patio is adorable, although it is very close to a sewer, so you will frequently get whiffs of an unpleasant smell.   Ok, now the reason for only two stars. Despite the food, cocktails, and decor, the service is abysmal. I never go here if I need to be quick because I know that unless I'm the only party in the restaurant, I'm not getting out of here in under an hour. The servers are dismissive and nonresponsive, and I still would've given it three stars, but the last time I was there the service was so bad that it's brought me to Yelp.   We had a large group, and the first thing that happens when we are seated is our server spills an entire glass of ice water down the back of a member of our party. Instead of apologizing he throws a towel at her and runs away. He never returns to clean up. My friend goes to the bathroom to dry off, and I went to speak with the manager because I just didn't like the way it was handled (no apology, not cleaning up the spill, just handing her a towel and disappearing). The bartenders even told me the waiter ran away and was hiding over it. This should NOT have been this big of a deal.   So I spoke with the manager, and everything was fine, and she came over to our table when my friend returned and offered to comp my friend's meal and the party's first round of drinks. She also had a conversation with my friend separately where she stated this. However, when the bill came, she decided what was \"fair\" would be to only comp my friend's meal \"because she was the only one that had water spilled on her.\" She then claimed she never told us she would comp a round of drinks for the table despite 5 of us hearing her say it. Additionally, despite the immediate error, the service did not improve. We never saw our waiter after he brought our food.  Again, none of this would have been this big of a deal had he just apologized and helped clean up, if the manager had not stated she would comp drinks for us and then change her mind, and if we had just gotten some acknowledgment during our meal. I hate being a pain in the ass, but the way they handled themselves made me upset.",

Then the breakfast burrito was missing the potato and cheese, and even had tomatoes on it when tomatoes weren't listed on the menu at all. The food ended up being tasty but could have really been great if the ingredients were all there. The cook just really needs to review the menu and make the food correctly then the place would deserve 5 stars.",

It was Friday and this was the third or fourth stop of the night. I just had to break our one drink per bar rule because the drinks were so good! My favorite was the pillowtalk. It was a light girly drink and I wasn't sure if I tasted any alcohol, but that could've been because I was already drunk.   This place reminded me of Alice in Wonderland meets the Secret Garden. It was very cute. There's also a hidden smoking area where they have a teeter-totter which is pretty much always occupied. Most people were hanging out in the outdoor area rather than the inside bar area. Crowd was friendly and chill. It was one of the slower bars we went to compared to the other ones on that street. Loved the atmosphere though.",

Just a block down from the loudest, craziest nonsense one can find in Las Vegas comes this unassuming little box of good times. Comfortable atmosphere, delicious bites, great drinks, friendly service, free juke box.   The decor is fun, it's almost like being trapped inside of the Urban Outfitters website, but in a soothing way. My companion had the chicken nuggets and a few custom-made concoctions from the bartender, I had a few of the happy hour girl drinks which were surprisingly delicious but didn't pack too much of a punch...my only complaint. It's a wonderful break from the usual and a welcome refuge for those of us who enjoy Vegas but need a slice of normalcy to get through the day.",

Every item is either greasy, painfully dry, or a mixture of awkward flavors.  About the only things I would even consider to recommend is the tater tots or fried pickles, but those items don't really showcase a menu, rather late night drunk food.    It's a typical downtown hipster setting, and the decor is suiting to that theme.  They change up the art work on occasion and I do find the paintings and photos interesting and fun to look at.   The service and staff are very friendly and attentive.  But overall, I wouldn't say this is a place I would recommend, rather if I am invited to go with people, I wouldn't object.",

I mean, once you get over the tacky 60s decor, gaudy outfits the bartenders and waitresses have to wear, creepy big headed people wallpaper in the women's restroom, stuffed ducks fornicating above the bar, and caged in teeter-totter in the outside patio area, it's actually a nice bar. I promise.  It all adds to the odd charm.  Everything about this place is different.  Let me expand on the teeter totter.  When you walk out onto the back patio, there's a little 3' gap in the back fence on the left.  That secret passageway leads you to an old looking see-saw in a very claustrophobic fenced in area.  If you look up, you'll notice prison-like barbed wire fencing.  It's kind of a odd feeling, not going to lie.  But as I stated, it all adds to the charm and uniqueness of the place.  The drinks come out in mason jars, which I am actually a fan of.  The bar service was attentive and timely, even when our large and rowdy bar crawl group was there.  I can't speak for the food unfortunately; I didn't get to try it.  But maybe I'll go back for that (I've heard it's just so-so) just to say I did it and post an update on Yelp.",

I ask for mustard and ketchup and pickle and I'll just add it . She brings me out honey mustard . I asked do u have regular mustard they said no . strike 2 . I said u forgot the pickles . Pickles come out , I taste them they are hot pickles ! Strike 3 I say these pickles r hot . She replays that's all we have . So I canceled my order . Looks like the food was good but service sucks",

    "text": "I came here by word of mouth with my 3 friends when we went to the vegas this past weekend. It was perfect for me because I like experiencing new bars and don't necessarily dig the whole clubbing scene in vegas or anywhere else for that matter.   As my friends and I got to the front of the bar, we were greeted by this friendly white girl in the front who was more than happy to give us pointers on what to order. She sat us back in patio seating and I noticed how unique the vibe was because of the decor of the restaurant.   \"The Vibe\"-Honestly it felt like I was walking through a scene of a cool beer commercial as we were walking down the hallway to the patio. clean, bugged out, and a hint of sexy.   \"The Service\" - After they cleared out our table/bench, it took a few minutes for me to flag down a server, but I guess that was cool because it took a while for us to figure out what exactly we wanted to. When she came, she was super cool and gave us great recommendations for our food. Got to give it up to Corina...she was dope.   \"The Food\" - We ordered our drinks first and little did I know that my friend was on a mission to find \"Banana Bread Beer!\" supposedly its pretty rare to find but hella good.  So that was a huge plus for me and my friend.The hostess told me to order \"the Philly Mac and Cheesesteak sandwich\" and the sweet potato tots, I did not disappoint . My meal had all kinds of cheesy cinnamony goodness. My friends and I all decided to share food, my homegirl decided to order the Chicken waffle sandwich which was also really good, and my other friend ordered the veggie sliders. All the food had a great flavor. It was super hard to make a decision here , because I also wanted to try their burgers.   In the end my friends and I agreed that this is the type of spot , we would most definitely do a turn around trip from LA to Vegas, because everything was on point and awesome!",

The first time I tried to order postmates and the park cancelled my order because they were busy, no big deal i understand. About two weeks later me and my boyfriend decided to actually go eat there and check out the brunch menu. We waited to be seated for only about 10 mins, we were seated outside in the back. I loved the decor and atmosphere and was very excited to finally try the drinks and food! We had been seated for about 20 mins and not one waiter/waitress acknowledged we had been sat. No one said \"I'll be with you in a moment\" no one brought us water, it was like we weren't even there. We had been passed by multiple waiters and waitress but nothing. Finally I got up and talked to the hostess who said she'd bring someone to our table right away, at that time though we were just over it and left to eat somewhere else instead. Very disappointed I really wanted to try the menu! I don't think I'll ever go back. Had just one person even acknowledged our presence we probably wouldn't have left",

It was perfectly cooked and absolutely delicious, with just the right level of spice.  The rest of their brunch menu was full of other interesting outside-the-box selections.  Lunch menu looks interesting too.  I enjoyed a \"Derby Breakfast Club\" Bloody Mary along with it: Bacon-infused Old Overholt Rye Whiskey, Bloody Mary mix, hickory liquid smoke, crisp bacon, and half a pickled hard boiled egg.  Tasty variation on a classic morning drink.  Nick says there're plenty of places for bacon & eggs or buffets, but if you want a more creative breakfast that doesn't taste like what you get at a million other places, check out Park on Fremont!",

Personally I think the Bloody Mary list is awesome; the Tuxedo is my favorite. The decor inside and outside is interesting and unique; I often find myself spacing out staring at the art and designs on the walls. The fried pickles pair well with the bloody Mary's. You won't regret giving Park on Fremont a visit. If it's a nice day sit outside in the front and people watch, or in the back and play on the teeter totter.",

A different server brought out our food and we had to ask him for the drinks and it still took awhile to get our drinks after that! We ordered a beer, which came in a bottle and a moscow mule. The moscow mule came out in a clear plastic cup! Ummm yeah that's not acceptable, especially when there are copper cups right at the bar. Maybe they were just decorations?!! Lame. When my husband went to the bar to ask for a cup, the bartender was rude and said the dishwasher was broken! She practically rolled her eyes at him while pouring my drink out of the plastic cup and into the copper cup. Her service was terrible. The place was pretty empty at the time too. Sadly, won't be back after that kind of service.",

Service is a bit slow, so if you plan on doing a work lunch here, order drinks and food a the same time and go ahead and ask for the check when the food is served. The food is tasty and the salads are perfectly portioned to fill you up. I really like the strawberry chicken salad and the sweet potato tater tots.   I absolutely love the decor, it is perfectly my style - antique yet contemporary and little unsettling (some of the photography is actually kind of creepy). There is plenty of seating out doors in the front, inside, and out doors in the back. The chairs aren't the most comfortable, but sometimes sacrificing comfort for style is necessary.   They have an impressive selection of beers and I'm amused by the way they are broken up on the menu. Listed under \"High School Hangover\" you'll see selections such as Coors and Bud Light. \"High School Hangover\" is a very accurate title. Under \"The Graduate\" you'll see craft beers such as Dogfish Head. I'm excited that my taste in beers is listed under \"The Graduate\" title. I'm proud to have graduated beer school according to the Park on Fremont!",

The playful and eclectic decor provides a fun environment in which to enjoy some slightly upscale and/or creative bar food. The happy hour deals are great. Many of the appetizers are $5 during happy hour and are still full portions and many of the draft beers are $5 as well which includes a very decent selection of quality craft brews.   We tried:  Fried Pickles - Very good, crispy, well-seasoned and served with a very flavorful sauce for dipping.   Garbage Fries - I'm not usually a fan of smothered fries. I like my fries crispy and salty, that's it. But these were great. They still managed to maintain their crispiness and the cheese and toppings were actually very flavorful and delicious.   Mac and Cheese Balls - Our server said this was her favorite but we weren't bowled over by it. Ultimately we just thought they were bland.   Chicken Bar Bites - Basically boneless wings served with 3 sauces and french fries. Not bad, but not great. Their fries are excellent though.   We had one slightly odd complaint. The restaurant smelled like fish, and not in a good way. My wife and I could both smell it, and I have a pretty lousy sense of smell. We asked the person at the table next to us and they could smell it too. Our sever suggested that it may be the sewer lines on Fremont (the entire front of the restaurant is open to the outside) but we didn't smell anything outside, just inside. We will definitely give this place another try (there are other items on the menu that I want to try out) and when we do, if the smell is gone I will update my review to remove any mention of it.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I visited downtown LV this past weekend to take advantage of the good weather and the fact that I was not stuck at work for once during the day!! After being super indecisive over where we wanted to have our late lunch, I realized I've had Park on Fremont bookmarked since I've never gone before, and so that was our final choice. Once you reach the entrance, they greeted us and asked if we preferred inside or outside, and because it was so nice outside, we choice out. The host led us to the seating area right outside where we had the entrance of the Fremont Experience right in front of us. I was a bit disappointed and upset because when I had looked at their yelp photos prior to coming in, I saw the beautiful outdoor seating in their garden. It was then that I realized they had two outdoor seating areas. (If I had known the patio she led us to was not connected to the garden, I would have requested to be seated in the backyard garden). Nonetheless, it was still nice and cute.   Food/drinks: So our waitress came and asked us what drinks we would like to start off with. Again, after looking through their yelp reviews and photos, I found that they served Banana Bread Beer and it was super popular (and because I LOVE banana bread, I was curious to how it would taste hehe). Sadly, when I requested for that drink, she said they were all sold out. I didnt prepare myself for a back up but she immediately recommended for me to try their organic strawberry beer, so I agreed. My boyfriend was okay with his first choice, and was happy. Yet, after giving my drink a try, the waitress asked me how I liked it....because she NEVER tried it before... Well, I didn't really enjoy it toooo much. It was okay, tasted like beer filled with strawberry syrup.. Um, I only decided to go with that because she recommended it to me and I trusted her! All along, she's never even tried it!! hahaha, if i knew, I probably would have picked something else on my own that I knew I would like. Oh well, at least I guess I now know how organic strawberry beer tastes like.. lol. Okay, moving on to the food. Since I was trying to go for something a bit light, I ordered the garden burger with sweet potato tots. The burger was a bit bland, but the sweet potato tots came with sweet honey mustard and omg I was addicted to that! hahaha. My boyfriend order the chicken and waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots as well. There wasn't anything really special about his sandwich, I wish the waffle was a bit more crispy.   All in all, Park on fremont is super cute and I love that! The food is just okay, BUT they have a wide selection of drinks to choose from (it just sucks when they run out, wahh!). Nonetheless, I still enjoyed my experience. Staff is very friendly!",

Which sometimes is ok, but the prices made me like it less.  Also the crickets on the patio creeped me out while they crawled on my feet. Had to move once to escape them!",

Clearly the sort of place where cuisine is considered less important than booze and decor suffice it to say that the beer list and creative cocktails far outnumber the options for food and even with the extended brunch menu it was only in three items that myself and a friend could muster enough interest to indulge, the plates arriving in two rounds as we sat amidst a room awash in faux-taxidermy and paintings ranging from humping animals to possessed children with neither rhyme nor reason to be found.  Opting for one starter to precede a duo of entrees it would not be long before the best bites of the meal would arrive and served as a quintet the Mac & Cheese balls each proved not only sizable but also quite delicate, the crackling panko overlying supple pasta with briny bits of bacon imbuing each bite plus a sidecar of cheese sauce for those desiring even more cream.  At this point happily conversing about recent events as background music played on it was after only the slightest of delays that three trays would arrive and with the kitchen opting to split our French Toast while the sandwich was served whole it can only be said that neither dish tasted as good as it looked, the brioche too lightly soaked and thinly sliced to allow the exterior to be rendered crisp without burning it while the waffle was chewy and lifeless, a bready detriment to otherwise pleasant chicken and bacon served alongside entirely forgettable, yet all too trendy, 'tots.'  Not exactly a disaster in that the service was pleasant while the Mac & Cheese Balls were far better than standard pub-grub suffice it to say that for those not interested in being upsold on cleverly named cocktails or craft beers Park on Fremont has little to offer - a quick walk down the street to MTO, eat, S+O, Carson Kitchen, or DuPar's offering far more extensive selection with equal or better value on the dollar at each.",

We've also just hung out at the bar on numerous occasions people watching, which can be quite interesting.  I love the quirky decor and the outside area in the back. The drink list is good, love the mason jars and the fun cocktail names. Where Park misses the mark for me has been a consistent disappoint in food and service. It lacks the wow factor and the staff often at times seems less than excited to wait on you. Guess what people! We're not all tourists and some of us are looking for favorite places to hang out. Ignoring your customer or acting like it's an imposition that we would want - gasp FOOD for lunch - is not going to turn Park into our Cheers.  I'm a bit impartial on this place but with so many options in the downtown area, I think having a friendly warmer environment with better food would definitely change my 3 star to a 5.",

I waited 5 minutes then asked the waiter if my plate was coming soon.  He told me yes and that he would check with the kitchen.  He didn't check back with me so i had to flag him down.   He assured me that it was coming.   20 minutes after my son received his meal and ate it, they brought out my plate ( fish and chips if i remember correctly)  i sent it back.  Very disappointed after the exceptional service i have received the last couple of times here.  Little reluctant to return. Food quality is very important but without service,  it gets thrown out the window.   The waiter was friendly but he should have told me that the kitchen forgot my order and had given me another option.",

I've been to park several times since they opened,  because of the convenient location and because i often find myself bar hopping along eat Fremont,  and it's... well... It's there.  The last time I was here was in the summer, and I remember thinking what I usually think about Park, which is: for a place that has so many mustaches and colored hair, they don't really have a good beer list. Needless to say I went back last night because of just those same reasons, needed a place to drink, that wasn't full of loud music... So I gave it another try, and I'm glad I did. The beer list has been expanded, and there are more really fun cocktails. It was a Thursday night and they closed around 11... Which was kind of weird, but everyone has the right to close when they want to.",

They have multiple types and all are amazing! Maybe don't try them all in one night (a story for another time ). Next, the decor is so unique and great for selfies and photos, though it can be dark inside at night. When I think of the Vegas local scene, it's places with decor and style like Park that come to my mind. The outdoor seating area is like stepping into another establishment altogether but still so whimsical and fun. The food menu, while not what you could describe as healthy by any means, has many drool worthy items that make an event or party here fun and can serve as prep for a night of drinking. There's a fun little 'secret' outside as well that people always enjoy seeing (and trying) when visiting.",

Perk one: it was easy to make a reservation through the Yelp app. Got the text message to confirm about 1 hour before my reservation time. Perk two: variety of adult beverages available for brunch - yummy Blood Mary called the Lady Cave.  Perk three (last, but not least): friendly staff from the hostess to your waitress. The hostess helped my friend figure out parking in the lot next door, and the waitress made me feel comfortable since I had gotten there before my friend.  As usual, the food was yummy! We had ordered the Garbage Fries for an appetizer. Fries were crispy and toppings were fresh. Then we ordered the Avocado Toast and Country Breakfast Burrito. Oh man... The burrito was so fulfilling. Couldn't even finish it with the chips on the side. The cool part was that it tasted like corned beef and hash to me. LOL. The Avocado Toast my friend ordered was so refreshing in comparison!",

The restaurant is right outside of the Freemont Street experience and container park. If you are looking to check out these areas this is a prime location. The decor was also adorable. I loved all of the succulents and greenery, the hanging chandeliers, the taxidermy, patterned wallpaper. Basically hipster paradise and reminded me of almost every restaurant I visited in Austin.  Unfortunately food and service was just so-so. The waitress gave me an attitude when I asked to sit outside and when I asked if there was an option to look at the lunch menu in addition to the brunch. We sat outside at one of the few front tables, and when I went to the bathroom I discovered that there was a beautiful courtyard with a ton of seating. It would have been really nice to be given that option - especially considering it was fairly empty when we arrived because they had just opened.   My wings were rubbery and not crispy at all. My fiance's loaded tots were topped with so much queso that the tots basically just turned into one big mush. The chicken in the dish was rubbery as well. Not sure if we made bad picks or just mehh food... but we were not satisfied. Best part of the meal was the 20 dollar bottle of champagne that came in a plastic shopping bag. So. Hipster. But that's basically like 5 or 6 mimosas for 20 dollars which is a steal.  If I'm ever back in the area I'd probably opt to eat elsewhere, but for a drink on the back patio (hopefully in the back) I'd love to return.",

The waitress/hostess was noticeably busy and flustered, but did not handle customers well.   While waiting for a table she approached me and asked \"do you have a question?\"  No, I want to get a seat and was told to wait to be seated by your sign. After asking to sit outside I was informed that only eating customers could sit outside, everyone else had to sit at the bar. Less that 30% of the outside tables were taken, and no one had food.   This place has amazing potential with a really cool drink list, fabulous vibe and what may or may not be yummy food. But their service is unfortunately subpar. Don't say I didn't warn you, but I suggest going elsewhere. Good drinks are a dime a dozen in Las Vegas.  Was contacted by customer service to let me know their policy recently changed and they are a restaurant first...so what does that mean? Your policy changed from what? Being friendly to discouraging customers? Allowing patrons not rating to sit outside? I'm so confused...and apparently so are your customers (I ate their the night of my post). The service has repeated hits on yelp because it's failing. We waited nearly 20 min for the happy hour Brussels sprouts we ordered (oh yeah, we ordered food). I'm sorry, this place needs better management that understands operations and customer service.",

The outdoor back patio was closed, but looked cool. We will be back and try happy hour soon.",

How can you fuck up coffee?  To receive food we waited 1 hour and 22 minutes!! Its just breakfast! I ordered their park Benedict eggs,  taste was good but it came out cold and with cold coffee there's very little to enjoy.  Seems the staff is also used to this because they don't even ask how's everything, cause they know they're fucking up big time.  The alcoholic beverages (cocktails) are watered down piss, don't even waste your time drinking here.  You would think that a restaurant located on Fremont with such huge touristic traction would have top notch service, not the case here! So disappointing,  spend your hard earned money somewhere else",

I'm not sure I would say it's kid friendly, due to some paintings and such, but it's a great place on a day of good weather when sitting outside. Noise level was decent, depending on the day I believe. Food wise, there weren't any major favorites. I would say their sandwiches tend to be the most popular item, which is a more heavy brunch in my opinion, but still good.",

Dog friendly:  Fur babies & pup mums welcome in the front patio. The first time I ate here was with my previous bosslady and her huge St. Bernard - who was welcomed with the water bowl upon entering.  LOVELY for BRUNCH in the front and people watch or in the garden while lounging in the cute patio chairs, art and fresh flowers always, sweet on Sundays for mimosas easing back into the work week.  LOVELY for DINNER in the garden date once the \"f*cking beautiful\" neon sign lights up, the trees twinkle and you want to turn on the charm. As the fireplace also sets the mood.  Really, the Garden is ALWAYS LOVELY, feel free to hopscotch your way in. It's what I wish my back yard looked like sometimes.   Highly recommend eating here, drinking here, even if its quick and you must stop to use the facilities as all employees must wash hands and \"say bloody Mary into the mirror three times before returning to work\".  The usuals ordered with friends are the Mac & Cheese balls, which we recently discovered has changed drastically in recipe! NOO! Bring back the original mac & Cheese balls!! I also enjoy the garbage fries which is much more delicious than it sounds.   Park on Fremont's been around only a few years, yet has quickly become a staple, hot spot to eat pregame and bar hop the night away as it is also well located in the center of where touristy Fremont experience ends and local artsville Fremont East begins.",

Plus the prices are much more reasonable than a lot of hyped up Vegas eateries. Plus you can hang out for a few hours and decompress before going back to the casino.  Downtown Vegas has changed a lot (for the better IMHO), partially thanks to places like Park on Fremont. Plus they use Yelp Reservations!",

We had a large group at a picnic table on the patio in the back, it has a charming feel to it. Water and drinks are served in mason jars, another detail which was cute.   Since it is summer in Vegas, I was looking for a light option: the Strawberry Salad another Yelper was enjoying looked great. First I asked if any protein could be substituted for chicken, as I'm a Pescetarian: answer was no. The salad was indeed refreshing with berries, walnuts, gorgonzola and mixed greens. When the bill arrived, I was shocked that I was charged $12.00; the same price as the salad with chicken. A \"tall\" Belvedere and soda was also $12.00. Didn't want to nitpick at a party, so I paid my $31 (with Auotgrat, tax etc) and we explored the teeter totter/smoking area of patio and took photos.   Service was professional and a little over zealous on bussing. Different people kept asking to clear plates and at one point, took someone's unfinished meal. Water glasses were regularly filled and we were asked if we needed more drinks, etc. Those having the chicken and waffle sandwich were underwhelmed: the waffle was not crispy on the outside and one said something seemed to be missing. Both the sweet potato tot and fried pickle I tasted were good; the sriracha ketchup was great - and I don't care for ketchup! In all, the meals were good, but not great.   The patio is really pretty and has some quirky and interesting decor: mismatched plates adorn one wall and a large portrait of horses ummm mating, another. Eclectic. It looks very pretty lit up at night.   I'd definitely come back for drinks, the bar looked cool and drink prices were reasonable. The menu could use some tweaking especially in the non-fried food, vegetarian options. A welcome addition to Fremont Street.   Yelp 100 Challenge",

It's one thing to claim ignorance, but when Julie admitted that she took the reservation and then hours later once we all show up, she just decided to disregard it and then close the bar...if I owned this bar my question would be \"why were the doors closed at midnight?\" \"Why is the cash register so light after a group of 40 was present and ready to eat and drink?\" \"Why does Julie still have a job after disrespect to paying customers?\" The bar across the street however was epic!",

    "text": "I love this place!!! So many times I have been here. I love the warped/Alice in wonderland feel to it. You walk in and you can sit inside or you can walk outside at sit at the tea party! I prefer outside u tell its 110 degrees. Be warned if you sit outside every once in a while you will get a bee checking you out. For me a bee is like a stalker best far away and after someone else! I've been here during the day and at night. The smoking area is behind all the dining chairs and fireplace. You walk back through a little side opening and there it is!!! The big steel adult size teeter totter!!! Almost every time I go on that thing and travel back to being a kid and having butterflies in my stomach and uncontrollable giggles.   I've had lots of stuff here. The food is good! I love the cheer potato tots! They are so good and tiny. The chicken and waffles yumm! The mac n cheese steak huge and good!!! I can honestly say I've never had the garbage fries. I hear they are amazing. I haven't had anything I didn't like.   One thing I do have to say. I have never had outstanding or even great customer service. I think the servers here do need work on customer service. Since a lot of us locals do come in. On several occasions I've had to send my food back because it didn't come out how I ordered it. Because they don't right it down. And they seem like it's an inconvenience to them to make sure we get our orders right.   I've gone back and forth on weather to give this place 5 or 4 stars. I'd give the decor 5 stars and the food 5 stars. The service 3 stars. So I'm giving it a 4 star",

With that said, the service is AWFUL. Having a collective of bartenders, service staff, and management treat us with a complete lack of respect is inexcusable.    We had made reservations a week in advance only to find out on the day of that there was no record of it. We thought we had fixed the issue with, Julie, the \"manager\" however when people started to arrive they were told it was last call.  Apparently, Julie hadn't fixed the problem at all and the 40 of us were left without a venue. Our savvy party planner to the rescue could fix this, yes? I mean, what bar in their right mind throws out 40 people on a freaking Tuesday? Park on Fremont, that's who. After Julie kicked out said party planner 30 seconds later and the place was empty. However, the bar across the street was more than accommodating.   I only hope the owners can see that Julie is bad for their business. Take your business elsewhere until PoF can clean up their act.",

It's more than just a restaurant, it's an experience!  Let me start off by saying there's a seesaw in the back.  YES, a SEESAW!  It's awesome and reason enough to give this place five stars.  Oh, the food..  So fun!  By far the coolest menu I've ever had the pleasure of ordering from.  Sweet potato tots?!   Daaaang.. So good.    It's perfect for brunch, lunch, dinner and for fun bar adventures!  I could carry on for hours on how much I love everything about Park on Fremont, but, I think that would be a waste of YOUR time.  JUST GO!  Also, don't let the outdoor section scare you away with the Vegas heat.  They have umbrellas for shade and outdoor water misters all over the place!    To the owners:  Thank you for this gem!  Places like this are what us locals have been dying for!  Your restaurant is a piece art with killer grub and strong drinks.  Thanks Andi for your excellent service!  Also, I didn't know you were a fellow CrossFitter...?!",

    "text": "WOW is all I can say! I have been wanting to come to this restaurant every since my LV friends started writing reviews about this place!  Since we were in town celebrating our anniversary, I thought this would be a semi romantic spot to enjoy some good food, drinks and enjoy being in DTLV under the night sky!   I made a reservation a week before we came into town, Sarah (I believe was her name) took all my information down and answered all my questions (most important: what time does the kitchen stop serving food? Her answer 1:00 am... SCORE)  I also mentioned that we were coming there to celebrate our anniversary to which she got an excited tone to her voice and said this is a great place to do that. I will put you outside in the back garden; I know you will love it!   On the night we had our 10:00 pm reservation we were running behind taking our anniversary photos, I called in to see if we could move it to 11:00 pm. The manager answered and said that will not be a problem.  Parking is either on the street or in a parking lot, we opted for the street. We have not been to DTLV for a while and had no idea on the huge changes it has been undergoing. In addition, I must say DTLV you are starting to clean up really well. Instead of all weirdoes, there is more of a hipster meets college meets semi professional vibe going on in that area!   We walked up and was greeted the by security who ID'd us. I told him we had a reservation and where should we go (total noob moment) he said that the manager could help us and on cue out, he walked. He asked if we would like to sit outside in front, inside at the bar or outside in the garden. I said the garden would be nice.  We were lead out to the back area, I fell in love with the hall leading out the back door chandeliers of all shapes, and sizes were hung up high!  Walking out into the garden area was beautiful, surreal, and cozy all rolled into one! It is a little vintage, a little Alice in wonderland/Mad Hatter tea party-ish.  We were seated at a smaller table, to which the manager apologized that the bigger tables were taken at the moment. It was not an issue at all to us. He said that the menus/drink menu were on the table and our waitress will be right with us. He wished us a Happy Anniversary too!  Our waitress Carina was super outgoing and friendly. She came by and took our drink orders. I was quite impressed as she was the only waitress that was serving everyone who was outside!  Our drinks were delivered to our table as we took in more of our surroundings. Loved the neon lime green electric sign on the wall that said \"Fucking Beautiful.\" High above us was a vintage-gothic Cinderella carriage complete with a chandelier inside! Various humorous paintings were hung around along with vintage statues. We were told before we left to check out the smoking area and the famous seesaw. Which we did after dinner, sadly we did not get to take a ride of the 'saw as there were already a couple of fun loving people who were waiting!  Our waitress came back and said she wanted to move us to a bigger table that opened up. She said she felt bad that we had this tiny table. So we moved across from where we were seated.   She then asked if we were ready to order, which we were:  Had the Fried Chicken and waffles with fries on the side. I have no clue why some of these reviews complained that the food was mediocre or lacked any taste. Both Minh's and my dinner were tasty! FYI I fell in love with his tater tots (but I will leave that for him to review) my waffles were huge and fluffy with just enough syrup and powdered sugar to top it off! The fried chicken was cook to a golden brown and was tender and juicy on the inside! I was able to finish one part of the sandwich and was working on the second half when I started to realize I was getting full!   During our meal, Carina made sure we were happy with our meal, she had our drinks refilled and brought out to us!   After we were finished with our dinner, we were told that the restaurant had a surprise for us. A couple of moments later a waiter brought us this HUGE chocolate chip ice cream sandwich cookie! We were wished a Happy Anniversary by Carina and if we needed anything else to let her know.  The cookie was a little hard on top but the ice cream was delicious and made the bottom cookie soft and more enjoyable to eat! However, being we were already full it was hard to enjoy such a lovely and thoughtful gift! I had a couple of bites of everything before I tapped out for the night!   Prices and quantity of food was not bad at all! A++++ to Carina and the night manager (who worked on 5/19) thank you so much guys for making our special night more enjoyable!   I think Minh and I found a new hang out spot in DTLV for good food, and radtastic drinks!!",

Both of us are in the industry and were extremely disappointed with the lack of service we received.  One drink between the two of us because the bartender never came back to ask if I wanted something to drink.  We then had to ask for boxes and our check. We got the check, and no box. At that point we were over the entire experience, and left without a box.  We would usually never post something like this on yelp, but we were extremely disappointed.

With about ~20 attendees I made sure to make reservations weeks in advance. Things started off smoothly initially, the waitress was adequate. For a party that big, and considering the place wasn't swamped or anything (it was on a Thursday night), she did the bare minimum. Considering that she knew she was getting auto grat she felt no need to hussle. Also, why did they not designate a back up server for a party of that size? People were without drinks or drink refills for a long time. The food was overpriced and average at best. It took FOREVER to get the plates cleared and out of the way. When she realized she probably had already earned her 18% auto grat or whatever it was on a party that large, she pretty much jumped ship. You had to physically track her down, or wait a very very long time for her to come back around.  The place itself looks cool with some interesting detail, but at that point, the decor was all they had going for them. I would not come back here to sit down and eat, nor would I suggest it to others.. Sure, come through, get a drink from the bar, take in the unique yet highly hipster decor and move on.",

    "text": "We stumbled upon this place at night and just asked some people- mid-bite, of course- if this place had good food. They said yes, so we went to the host stand. The host-dude with the awesome beard let us sit down at the bar since elsewhere would take a bit. We were super patient but the bartenders/servers were trying to keep up with the tons of people and orders coming in. We decided to leave and as soon as we turned (I didn't even get to put one toe on the ground!!), awesome-beard-host-dude stops us and asks if we have been helped. We kindly reply no, and he insists that we stay!! He personally took the bartender over to us to make sure we got helped. What amazing service!!! We had Web's Banana Bread Beer and the Unicorn. An amazing beer, and a yummy cocktail!!!! We ate brussel sprouts and the Turkey bacon avo philly. Both were super delicious!!! I've been telling all my friends to eat and drink here if they decide to visit Fremont!!! We will be back when we visit again!!",

I have to say, this was probably one of the best indoor / outdoor bar restaurants I've experienced when I want to get away from the strip. visited on my many trips to Vegas throughout the years.  The atmosphere was inviting, the drinks were amazing, and their selection of food was something I really needed (and affordable).  I highly recommend the Park to anyone looking to hangout with good friends in a not-so-crazy atmosphere...keep up the great work.",

Not a traditional menu but in a good way. Drinks were good and breakfast was awesome. We had Chilaquiles which is cilantro steak and eggs served with house made chips and salsa. Very good and unique. As far as drinks Peach fuzz smash and Park Paloma were very refreshing.  Our server Andrea was helpful and friendly. We will be back as there is plenty more on the menu that we want to try.",

As for beer, the Banana Bread beer is a signature brew that I absolutely love. Everything from the fried pickles on the appetizers menu to the Chicken and Waffles sandwich is perfect in this place.",

    "text": "Ah. Park on Fremont. I've passed it so many times while going up and down Fremont when out with friends, I've never even thought to come in and check out their selections. I tried it today... and wasn't too wowed by them. I made reservations, but found it unnecessary. The inside decor is very Tim Burton meets Anthropologie. They try but it's off a beat. It smells..like how you smell after a night out downtown - sweaty and dried alcohol. It really rubs you the wrong way. The wait staff was prompt, and she immediately offered to take our drinks order. Not too much selection but enough to wet your whistle. I got my usual jack and ginger, but apparently it's a mule here. Sounds good. My friend got the pillow talk. My drink was fine, nothing out of the ordinary, a bit weak. Hers had a description of so many yummy fruits, but when it came out there weren't any slices or anything. Weird. I mean we weren't expecting a sangria, yet still, at 10 bucks a drink, a bit of embellishment would be nice. She also said it was a bit weak. My other friend got the trophy wife, but she said her drink was good.   The food was okay. Nothing out of the ordinary and was okay tasting. The monte cristo wasn't even fried, nor was it sweet. My friends got burgers and they were okay, honestly in n out would've been cheaper and yummier. I can't get over the portion sizes- they're tiny! The place was nicely busy, but everyone seemed to be digging into their food. It seemed okay at best. I think this is where tourists come while day drunk.   The best part of the visit was the postcard bit. They give you a postcard to send while out lit. That's super cute.   Maybe as a local you expect downtown to just \"get you\" and try to make sure you're taken care of. We felt kind of jipped, when we were just hoping for a nice buzz. Win some, lose some. This isn't a win.",

My bf being confident of my Yelp skills asked me to find a unique brunch place that had good beer and a TV. He had the steak skillet which was cooked perfectly and I had the chilaquiles.  The chips were crispy thin and freshly fried.  They didn't have a TV but the bartender had extensive knowledge of UFC which kept my boyfriend occupied while I posted pictures of our trip on Facebook to make all my friends jealous. We will definitely be back. JAH",

The happy hour menu is always great too!   My boyfriend and I shared the chicken bar bites, Mac n cheese balls and fried pickles. The chicken bar bites were by far the best. They came with a side of fries which were absolutely delicious with the side of spicy ketchup. The mac n cheese bites were good, but the BF liked them more than I did. Being a pickle lover I thought I would enjoy the fried pickles but I didn't really care for them too much. The batter wasn't too flavorful and the pickles tasted more like cucumbers to me.  The other downside to this place is how slow the service is. My group was seated for about 20 mins before we had to request a waiter from the bar.   Overall it's a good place, but nothing too supreme.",

We said we'd wait but she wouldn't take our name because it's strictly first come first serve. What? So we sat at the bar and got some drinks and placed our food order with the bartender. We saw more tables open and asked the host if we could go there (she did not come to get us). So we waited until about 12:30 when the bartender asked if we'd gotten food yet. She had already cashed us out so we had to tip on food we hadn't even gotten yet. The place is also dead. The tables are empty at peak lunch time. She went to ask what happened and apparently they took our food to the wrong table and those people just ate it. Our food came out very quickly after that. It tasted pretty good although that was the smallest egg I've ever seen in my life (I got the avocado toast). It was also supposed to be poached and it was overcooked. There are some easy policy changes they could make to help them help lots of money. Wait staff is friendly. It's a shame.",

The garbage fries are weird and tasty, and the Cajun chicken sandwich is delish. The salad that came with it was simple (mesclun, cucumber, tomato, blue cheese crumbles), yet impressive for size and freshness. The red sangria was like juice.",

The ambiance is fun and the redeeming part of the venue..  You need to work on your service, freshness of the food, and post your prices for beer.  You also need to serve beer in a beer glass, not a mason jar.",

Also had the quesadilla which was quite tasty and some chicken bites that were just okay. Service was sub par but then patio was busy.

The bar and back garden are beautifully decorated with all sorts of fun antiques and eclectic art pieces setting the tone for a good time no matter who you are.The menu was small but had just what we needed to cure our hangover from last night. I chose the huevos rancheros, and it hit the spot, most importantly it came out almost instantly! We also had something they call a patio pounder, a bottle of prosecco and a carafe of OJ, which was perfect to the take edge off from last night! Best part about this..it's only $20! As if the awesome food, atmosphere and booze wasn't amazing enough, the waitstaff was on point! Isabelle took care of our every need while juggling all her other guests with a smile on her face the entire time, and it was packed. Whoever is running this place is doing something right, we will def be back and suggesting this spot to our friends! Thanks for an awesome experience !",

My party wasn't able to enjoy the back because I had my one year old son, the host stated there was a bar in the back. Later on  while speaking with management about the services they stated  \"we could have sat out back, the bar was being moved and not in service\". After ordering we waited for 45min for our food to arrive. The waitress only came to the table twice out of the two hours of us being there. Once to drop off the food and once to drop off the drinks, we had to ask twice for refills. After getting our food my sister had the wrong order delivered, when she finally got her order there was a black hair mixed into the guacamole. The manager on duty spoke with my 15 year old sister about the experience we had. Even though I tried speaking she directed everything to a child at the table. I found this to be a joke given there was two adults who were paying for the meals. The restroom stalls had no toilet paper.I was pretty sad I spent money on this place I thought my family could enjoy.",

First, the hostess basically told us that she wanted us to sit at the bar (a lot of tables were dirty and the bar was empty with bartenders ready to serve). I thought it was odd, but I've worked in restaurants so we sat there even though we would have preferred outdoor seating. When we sat down, we didn't know what drinks we wanted yet, but said we definitely wanted fried pickles. We ordered drinks a few minutes later. We started to notice everyone around us was getting their food so my friend asked about the pickles. The bartender said the order was in and then asked what we ordered again. Then he said \"Oh no, I'm stupid\" and put it in the computer right next to him. No apology! Then, it took about 15 minutes to get the pickles. We asked for them to go, but they came out regularly. Another bartender took over our order and charged us the $8 for the worst fried pickles I have ever had. It took him 5 minutes to get the check prepared and another few to run the credit card as he was busy making drinks for other customers.",

The manager even came by to make sure everybody was doing OK.  I had a quick conversation with the manager and he told me the city just approved some beautification funds for Downtown Vegas (like funds for planting more trees, etc), so it should look a bit different and maybe less industrial the next time we're in town.  Really nice staff.  The decor was fun...reminded me a lot of Alice in Wonderland.  We sat inside because it was 100+ degrees outside, but they also have a beautiful outdoor seating area/garden in the back.  I had the Tokyo Tater Tots and a bloody mary while my wife had the Monte Cristo, all from the brunch menu.  All of it was very tasty.  All in all, a great place and a super short walk from our hotel on Fremont Street.  Friendly staff, creative drinks, and good food.  If you're looking for a break from the tourist hustle and bustle, this is a great place for you.",

This Bar is a cool place to stop and grab a bite and a few drinks while you're out on your Downtown Adventures. The Staff is also great and always on top of things. Kimber Barton, is hands down my new favorite Bartender! Super friendly and sociable! Instead of being treated like the usual 'customer' she treated me and my friends like 'guests.' We'll definitely be back soon! Hopefully she's working lol. I recommend this Bar to EVERYONE visiting Downtown LV, whether it's your first time in Vegas or if you're a Local and need to place to hang out. 10/10.",

When you walk in you have to be seated, they have outside dining,bar seating and tables/booths inside. We decided to eat at the bar on the outside and it was such a great decision. The bartender was a sweet heart and very helpful! We ordered a mimosa and a spicy Bloody Mary! Drink we're delicious and the Bloody Mary came with a boiled egg and bacon! We started off with the fried pickles (there's also some fried jalapenos in it) omg they were a 10! For our meal we ordered the cheese steak and the Garbage fries with steak! All the food was hot and tasty! Prices were great we ordered 4 drinks and appetizer and two meals all for around 80. You won't get that kind of deal on the strip! I love downtown! Service was awesome and that day every lady left with flowers! Happy Valentines",

    "text": "Right outside the Fremont Street canopy is Park on Fremont, a gastropub that opened last spring. It is hard to miss with its white picket fence. Once inside it feels like you've tumbled down the rabbit hole. Every inch of the place is dotted with quirky items, it's fun to let your eyes wander and see what they discover. I giggled at the stuffed birds, drooled over the taps on the mantle behind the bar and admired the chevron patterned floors while we waited to be seated. We chose to sit outside in the back outdoor garden.   It was a weeknight so it was pretty quiet. Our waitress was attentive, though, it seemed she might have been new. She was unfamiliar with several of the draft beers. My Kellerwies made its way to me so no harm done. Drinks are served in mason jars. The selection is wide and varied. We got started with Mac & Cheese Balls ($7).   The description hinted at bacon in the Mac & Cheese, however, there was no evidence of smokey, salty bacon. The balls were rolled in panko and fried crisp. They lacked any pizzazz. The garbage fries were recommended by our server we probably should have tried those.   Sandwiches run $10-$12, we had the Cajun Chicken, BBQ Burger and Philly Mac & Cheese. All were edible, but none really shined. The sweet potato tater tots are good, but the sweetness becomes cloying after a few. It's best to check out Park on Fremont for drinks and maybe a snack. If you're looking for meal, there are better choices to be had.",

    "text": "Definitely a different vibe and scenery from your other typical Downtown LV Fremont Street establishment.  Which I have to say is a very good thing.  I almost felt like this could be a gastro pub plucked right out of Downtown Santa Barbara or San Diego and through the technomagic of 22nd century additive manufacturing process better known as 3D printing technology reassembled layer by layer in the spot it currently occupied on 506 E Fremont Street in Las Vegas.  The abundance of flora, interesting selection of dark wall paintings and other decorations, the open air outdoor seating area in the rear, all reminded me of portions of SoCal, even though I am sure this is an original design.  Homesick much?  Maybe.  So I made my way to yet another pub type establishment, because of yet another friend's \"temporary relocation away from Las Vegas\" party or you can shorten it to your plain old going away party, but I felt the need for verbosity.  It was still relatively early, about 6pm, and my eyes had a hard time adjusting to the dimly lit interior as you walk into the bar area off the street.  The bartender and whoever else were working there must be busy, because no one acknowledge my presence at all.  Total fail on my part, especially after I had completed a session on How To Make An entrance at a work related workshop.   Not to be deterred by having been slighted by these employees, I brazing set off to explore the depth of this unwelcoming alcoholic dispensary.  I was shortly rewarded with the sight of a pleasant outdoor seating area, seemingly from another age.  Victorian perhaps, although with an added deliberate state of rehabilitation, for that extra feeling of mysteriousness.  Just like the people of the Victorian age in London, as my many hours of period drama viewing have taught me, the behaviors of the workers in this obscured portion of the pub conformed more expectedly to the ethereal temporal throwback of that bygone age.  In other words, they acted according to their station, and greeted customers with obvious courteous deference.  A menu and a mason jar of water was promptly brought out, as I waited for the entire gathering to assemble.  [Fast forward to the exciting part of the review - the food!]  Summer Strawberry Salad - very nice and tasty.  The chicken was moist and flavorful.  The salad was served on an eco-friendly bamboo plate. A little more gorgonzola cheese crumbles would be nice, but not a deal breaker at $12 a serving.  Cuban Sandwich - Decent, not the greatest, but I too finished it being brought up not to waste food as a child.  But I am thinking this was a seasonal promotion, as I no longer see it on their online menu.  Or it was simply not that popular.  I also had a few bites of a friend's Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  He was on a perpetual quest to find a good version of it here somewhere in Las Vegas.  Unfortunately his quest must continue, as the version here disappointed him greatly.  The waffle was the offending element if you must know more details.    Sweet Potato Teeter Tots that came with the sandwiches were good, especially with the dipping sauces.  Way better than fries I am sure.  The Classic Burger - didn't get to try it, but that looked very good and only comes with the MSRP of $9.  Overall, a nice little get away to dine at near Fremont Street.  Now that the weather is getting nicer again, it will be back on the list of places to hit up before it gets excessively hot.  If you are bored, explore the rear rear of the property, where you get to seesaw like you did when time was simpler, the chance of upward class mobility was bright, and the Pacific is not irradiated.  3 stars!

The beverages took way to long we ate without our drinks. Menu has mexican food with tator tots strange combination in my opinion. You should offer tortilla chips. Food dept needs some tweaks and then you will be a 5 star restaurant.  You can do it!!",

The bartender was our server which kinda sucked because we had to keep getting up to order our food ask for refills  ect. I do not think I will be giving this place another try.

Mind you we've  sat plenty of times back there and ordered drinks and never had an issue . So we head back in and of course the bar is full and we're getting no service and decided just to leave.",

Oh and you cant forget the \"fucking beautiful\" sign out back. So awesome. I really like the beer options they have. They have a strawberry beer that is amaze balls and they never fail to keep the place busy. The mac and cheese balls are huge and have bacon but you can ask for them without if needed, which is nice to list on the menu. I've been meaning to try brunch here because i hear it is the best.

The Park on Fremont is decently prices, has a beautiful patio, nice servers and good food and drinks!    Located on the corner of Fremont Street and Las Vegas Blvd, right before the entrance to the Old Vegas Strip. They have a patio out the side and a patio in the back, as well as indoor seating. I recommend sitting in the back, which has beautiful and unique decorations.  Get a spot under an umbrella and order some drinks, it is the perfect setting!   The drink I recommend is the Twig and Berry Mule, made with crushed berries,  gin, elderflower alcohol and ginger beer - so delicious and refreshing!   For food we had the Texas Burger, Caesar Salad, Fish Tacos and the Vegetarian Wrap. All were great! Loved the fish tacos, the fish was very fresh. The burger was also super good.    To sum it up, if you are in Vegas and looking for something a bit different than the typical Vegas thing than Park is it! Eclectic decorations, good food and drinks! A must visit!",

Didn't really order any food, but a couple of apps were used as props in a photo shoot going on in the patio area. The Sweet Potato Tots were okay, but not crisp enough for my taste.  Overall, cool vibe and can't say much about the food, but the douchebag doormen up front  may be enough to convince me to steer clear of this spot... ALOHA!!!

The atmosphere is fun and reminds me of West Hollywood. Great music selection and interesting decor. They have great patios and umbrellas for shade. The best part is the post card they let you fill out, they pay the postage, and send it out for you. I will definitely be coming back!",

I made a reservation for 15 and they required that I pay, in advance, for all 15 people PLUS the 20% gratuity (we're talking more than $500 prepaid). I wanted this location so I did it... Big mistake. Because life happens, I didn't end up having 15 people and after everyone had ordered and been drinking for almost 2 hours, we were still short of my prepaid amount by almost $200. Not only was I unimpressed with our wait staff but even more unimpressed by the fact that they were unwilling to do any sort of refund. I made a reservation for well after the dinner rush and still had almost a full reservation and couldn't hit their \"quota\" and had to eat the cost of whatever was left over. Their venue is cute and food is good but the service SUCKED and I will not be hosting any other event here again. There are better, more accommodating and understanding places downtown. I can assure you.",

After having horrible non-existent service at Evel Pie next door we walked over here , sat immediately and were greeted within 2 minutes. I didn't catch the bartenders name but I want to recognize him in his customer service skills! On a busy Saturday night downtown on Fremont you really don't expect anyone to explain anything to you like the menu or drinks, but our bartender asked questions and explained their new menu, gave us recommendations and was extremely pleasant. We got our drinks within a minute and our food within 10. No wonder this place has such good reviews!!   We ordered Garbage Tots and 12pc wings half BBQ and half Buffalo. 10/10 amazing food !!! Definitely will be returning!!",

Arrived just after 10, told hostess party of 6, told her had placed reservations online about 9 am, had confirmation.  Hostess asked for IDs and my daughters friend said she didnt bring it, left in hotel. We had been out very late night before at concert and gaming, and explained none of us would be ordering alcohol anyways.  Hostess said for seating inside an ID was required but with no ID we could sit outside. I explained we were waiting for 2 of my friends and their one year old son and hostess said that inside seating wasnt option anyways with 1 year old.  Now its 107 degrees outside and my party cant sit in the air conditioned area, even though there are lots of seats/tables, they just opened, and we ordered no alcohol. I have never heard of making customers eat outside if they have no ID, but if crazy ilogical policies like that are implemented they should be clearly stated on the website and on form you complete to make your reservation. Food was good, menu was unique and.trendy, and our server was efficient and friendly. Just dont agree with.or like being forced to sit outside, in extreme heat, to eat breakfast and.drink.our water, because of no ID or because group included child, the policy/treatment is lame.",

Tried calling the restaurant 3x this morning, but couldn't get a hold of anyone. Such lovely people working here. Do yourselves a favor and go someplace else there are plenty of great restaurants in downtown. Such a shame because everything was so great up until my discovery.",

The one thing I would love to see change for the next time I go back is the return of the Mac n Cheese balls. The best item on the menu, maybe one of my favorite things anywhere in Vegas. We would order several with our brunch and I would often order them to go home with me as well. Please, Please, PLEASE bring the Mac n Cheese balls back we can all enjoy them again!

    "text": "When you hit the end of the Fremont St. experience and head towards the El Cortez and Container Park, things shift from touristy to hipster REAL fast. And serving as somewhat of a gateway between these two vastly different parts of Downtown Las Vegas is Park on Fremont. The large draft craft beer selection and small bites of re-imaged pub fare screams hipster gastropub, but it's just as common to see a couple of \"regular folks\" wander over from the Fremont Experience to grab a NASCAR brew and a shot. And their extensive bottle selection goes from numerous west coast craft brews to bottles of Mickey's.    My first trip to Park was in Vegas last year. I stopped here as a \"beer layover\" on my walk from Container Park back to my hotel at the GN. This was the first place where I tried the awesome Stiegl Grapefruit Radler on tap. I didn't eat, although I REALLY wanted to come back for the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak. It sounds like such an atrocity for a cheesesteak purist like myself, but it had my curiosity peaked.  I did make it back to Park during my most-recent trip, but it was late-night and I just didn't have the hunger for something that large. Thankfully they had late-night happy hour, and their awesome Garbage Fries for $5. Topped with cheese, bacon, avocado, chipoltes, jalapenos, tomatoes, green onions, and fried egg for good measure ... it may look like \"garbage\" but it tasted delicious.   Park on Fremont is a place I want to continue coming back to each time I'm in Downtown LV. I've got to try the cheesesteak, and I still haven't checked out their patio yet. (Which looks awesome from the photos) It's worth the short venture off the \"Downtown Strip\".",

    "text": "So I've had this place on my Yelp bookmarks, and this used to be one of my favorite downtown spots, which is why I wish I could give this more stars. This place has some pros and some cons Pros -The decor is amazing.Theres a bunch of weird/cool looking decor on the wall, and their patio is quite possibly my favorite in all of Vegas. When I'm in there, i completely forget I'm in vegas because back there it feels like I'm in 5 different cities. -The drinks are generally pretty good. I appreciate when effort is put into a drink, and they are good for that. The mules are definitely toppers  -The Philly Mac n Cheese, and the Mac n cheese balls. I never realized Mac n cheese and Philly Cheesesteaks were such a perfect pairing until here. And their Mac n cheese balls are quite ridiculously good. I tip my hat to you Cons - Even when I used to come here on the regular, I was never a fan of their taco tuesdays. their tacos were decent, which isn't a big deal on either way because they're not a taco shop. I did however have an issue with the baby Dos Equis they used to give us. I mean it was like a gulp and a half. I perused the page and wasn't able to see any mention of taco  Tuesday. -I tried the chicken and waffle sandwich recently, and maybe its just me, but It wasn't as good as i remembered. I can't quite put my finger on what was different. Maybe it was the waffle or the chicken, but sad face from me. -Lie I said, the drinks are mostly good, but there were a few I wasn't a big fan of, but thats completely suggestive -People complain about the service. I'm not really going to because its been good and bad, and theres been times when there was a wait to get drinks and stuff, but it wasn't on the server so I try to not do that.  Overall, theres good and bad, I love the ambiance, but idk if thats something that necessarily holds. Two things that do intrigue me to try and check back in with them are the garbage fries; I somehow don't remember ever eating them but a lot of people are raving about it, and the twig and berry. I don't know if its new or if its always been around, but Its definitely something that looks to be worth a try and is part of the good parts of this place",

Servers are pretty attentive so no complaints there. :)  I have tried garbage fries, philly mac n' cheesesteak and bbq burger which were all quite filling and flavorful. My favorite part of my meal was the sweet tots! I'm a bit obsessed with it... Along with the yellow sauce that I keep forgetting to ask what it is!  Brunch time is my favorite and the fact that they offer a champagne bottle with OJ for only $20 won my heart. Nothing is better than eating a filling meal while classically getting drunk and enjoying the outdoors. :)",

    "text": "I made a reservation at Park on Fremont for Sunday brunch. Unfortunately, I picked a day when it was pouring down rain in Las Vegas (What are the odds?) The majority of the seating in the restaurant is outside on their patios, so I had to wait about 45 minutes past my reservation to be seated. Other than that, my experience was great here! The servers were pleasant and attentive. If you're someone who rolls their eyes at \"hipster restaurants\" then this probably isn't your scene. It's hipster paradise, but that's my kind of place.  The brunch OJ and bottle of champagne is a steal at $20, so definitely get that if you're brunching. The fried mac and cheese balls were the highlight of the meal. You can't beat anything with that much cheese. For my entree, I got the breakfast Monte Cristo with bacon egg and cheese between French toast slices. I wasn't blown away by it - I prefer a traditional pancake batter Monte Cristo - but it was solid! We also tried the Chilaquiles, they're fairly spicy but also good!  Honestly my favorite part of Park on Fremont was the decor. Everything is well thought out and it's really quaint and low-key. If you're looking for a break from the extravagance of The Strip, hop in an Uber and head to Park on Fremont.

Peppers and pickles was on point with the pastrami and cheese bringing the \"stoner\" and sandwhich all together.   Suggestion: In case this place reads their reviews might I suggest you slice you pastrami thinner. Still use the same amount of meat with much thinner cuts...buy a slicer? They work well.  Decor:  This place is funky and has a great vibe. A row of chandeliers down the hall way and plants growing out of dressers. What is this place red neck shique? Hippy glam? Whatever it is its funky and I'm down with it.  We will be back  Ps the taxidermy on different water foul having sex is perfect. Never take those down.",

They have outdoor seating and during the morning it's really nice. The breakfast burrito was surprisingly the best one I've had in Vegas hands down. It just tasted so fresh! Like the egg was so airy, the tortilla wasn't overly huge. Nice fresh ingredients in the burrito. The waffle was outstanding as well. The syrup they added didn't taste artificial and it even wasn't so overly bearing sweet where it was gross. The waffle itself was nice and airy while still being crispy on the outside. It blew our minds. Some of the best food we have had downtown. I would definitely recommend this place for breakfast",

Once we got indoors, we were even more blown away. This restaurant/bar is put together with so much exquisite attention to detail. It's absolutely beautiful. It's as if it were picked up and transported in from New Orleans. Everywhere we looked we felt our senses grow enriched.   The ambiance is so inviting - from the lighting to the excellent music to the comfortable, yet stylish seating. At the risk of sounding pretentious, people with an appreciation for beautiful art, great music, sensual experiences, and a sensitivity for gorgeous spaces and environments will absolutely cherish this place.   The back patio whisks you away to another world - it's a fairytale with fine art. If I lived closer, this is where I would hold special events.  We worked with Josh and Mikey, and they were incredible. Mikey was warm, funny, and super chill. He made great suggestions, and he only enhanced our experience. We were celebrating a special occasion and his genuine enthusiasm absolutely heightened the time we shared there.  Finally, the food and drinks. We ordered fried doughnut bites, mac and cheese balls, avocado egg rolls, and caesar salad. All of it was delicious. I even loved the iced tea - the perfect amount of sweetness.   Truly, one of the coolest places I've ever been. As someone incredibly smart at the restaurant said, \"If Las Vegas has any soul, this is where it is.\"",

The food selection is quite interesting, but the prices were a bit on the high side. For instance, you could get a Classic Double with Cheese for $13, or a Beef Satay appetizer for $14. The Beef Satay came with only five small skewers of meat, resting on a comically oversized mountain of slaw.   If you order the right things, like the burger, or the legendary Garbage Fries (get the tots), then this place is pretty good. Don't be afraid to ask how big the servings are. Go with some friends and have a good time!",

    "text": "The Park on Fremont has what I consider to be very basic or standard food. I had the Homestyle Breakfast which consisted of two eggs, ( I selected ) *bacon, potatoes and toast. When the food arrived and I instantly knew I made the wrong choice.  The soft scrambled eggs were not prepared as requested. The dried out potatoes were barely room temp and in no way prepared at the same time as my food. The bacon was standard not premium meat and the toast was slightly burnt accompanied by butter in a packet. Oh well. I should've gone to EAT just a short block away. The staff was friendly and helpful but the food missed the mark. Give it a try either way maybe it was just an off day for the kitchen.   I would also call to figure out the seating availability. When I arrived the hostess was pushing the outdoor seating on a gusty and cold day. I held out for a few minutes and luckily after a short wait I was able to be seated inside. She was very unclear in her explanation of the inside seating saying it was all reserved. The bar seems to be the hot ticket item especially with it so close to the surrounding area to then venture out into.",

It looked like traditional bar food, but was done in a much more upscale way! We got there in time for happy hour, which included $3 well drinks and $7 appetizers! I had the tacos and my bf had the wings. He wished he would have tried the garbage fries, because that's one of their signature dishes. We did do the waffle fries, which the ketchup has a great little spice to it. He had the fried donut bites, which are huge! They are served with sauces and whipped cream, and he loved them, but there were too many for one person, for sure!",

The location cannot be beat, but for being so close to the heart of \"Fremont\" I actually feel like it's hidden in plain sight.   Owned by the same guy as Commonwealth (my favorite Downtown bar) - Park features a cozy, eclectically rustic interior that features taxidermy (including some kinky, love-making birds) and Margaret Kesner style paintings. It's almost like a speakeasy feel with a hidden adult-sized see-saw in the back! (Note: if you're not into meat...this is not the place for you.)  Don't be deceived by the simple flatware and the paper napkins, this \"hipster\" hot-spot quietly boasts THE BEST burger in the city. Maybe the country, if not the world. I literally cannot bring myself to order anything else because that's how good this burger is. And it's \"that good\" every, single, time.  This is a great place to start your evening, but it's not open terribly late, so you can't end it here! The service is fantastic, often with more than one server, runner and/or manager stopping by to ensure all your needs are met. The food comes out hot, fresh and fast - I highly recommend it!   Be advised, they will card you at the door and they WILL make you empty any bottles you may have (including water.) The seating is more open than intimate, so be prepared to share a wall booth with a party on your left or right.",

Last week I was finally able to check this place off my bucket list or should I say my \"collections of bookmarked\" places on Yelp to try. I had a business expo event downtown this past week and decided to search around for some places to eat in the area with my co-workers. Park on Fremont was the closest so why not?  We arrived around the lunchtime hour (1PM-ish) and assumed they would be busy and we would have to rush to eat. Nope! To our surprise it wasn't busy at all (Thank GOD) because we were on a bit of a time crunch. Seated promptly our server came over to take our drink orders and because we had a whole 8 hours to go nobody opted for any adult beverages.. Yes we are responsible individuals lol. Anyways the water comes out in this cool glass jug and the cups in these little glass jars (cute).  Browsing the menu for lunch I guess I was a bit indecisive because they didn't really have anything that stuck out for me to try for lunch. I ended up with a Greek Salad (I know boring). My co-workers ordered the Turkey Bacon \"Avo-Philly\" and Marinated Chicken Tacos. Everyone's general response for the food was \"meh just okay\". Perhaps it was because we didn't order any of the special items or the lunch menu just wasn't for us. I do believe I will be back to try out the brunch here as that looks like what they are best known for.",

Not too bad of a wait either, we were seated right away once we got there.   We were really hungry so we decided to order n appetizer and our mail meal. We ordered the waffle fries to start and they were so goood! The cajun or whatever orange sauce they had was so yummy! Then my friend ordered the chicken and waffle entree and I ordered the Chilaquiles for mines. Her dish was a bit plain jane, nothing too shabby about the dish at all. My plate was good but more so on the tomato base sauce. It tasted like they put a lot of ketchup instead of any spicy salsa.... My friend advised me that is wasn authentic and that I would have to go back to a different spot to try it cause it was a bit Americanized. But not to worry as I finished up the fries as my appetizer and entree. IT was that good I barley ate my dish and just ate all the appetizers. Not to mention their cocktails are really good here too! Just an FYI their art on and wall decor is a a lil different but cool. kinda reminds me of AHS or something along those lines. Def will be back for the fries and cocktails!",

Salads, chicken salad sandwiches, that type of deal. The food is what you'd find at a pub.   I ordered steak tacos and they were okay. Nothing over the top. I paid $13 to have grapefruit juiced from the outside in and the vodka poured in. Silly me. The key lime pie was also disappointing. Grainy and it didn't have that tangy sour taste that gives you a pucker after you take a bite.  What I did like about this place was the decor and the bartenders. They were pretty cool, except one server pulled a crappy move when he came in and talked smack about a customer who ordered and old-fashioned and didn't know what type of bourbon he/she wanted them to make it with. Hey, you work there - how about YOU recommend something? Be nice. People can hear you.  Overall I'd go back for drinks - not in a grapefruit - and to check out the back patio, but wouldn't order food again.",

When I came, it was pretty empty and there was no music. The staff all seemed very fun, but I can see the place being more social and fun at night.  Service: the serviced was good, it didn't take long to get seated or have my food. Everyone was pretty friendly and always filled my water cup.  Foods and drinks: I had the large mimosa to be shared. If you are with a big group I would highly recommend it. My friend got the steak and eggs with potatoes, it was really good and cooked well although the steak was a bit on the drier side and eggs were scrambled where I prefer it being sunny side up. I ordered the breakfast burrito which I though was great, but I can't really say the food stood out too much.  Overall, I see this place as a good spot to hang it with a bunch of friends and have drinks, the food was good but did not stand out. I'd definitely come back for drinks and they have a bunch of good spots to take pictures on instagram and social media.",

Well, I heard that POF was trying a new breakfast option and had an exclusive special for Zapponians.  I took my coworker with me for an early morning walk to try out their new offerings!  Chef Thomas was there to greet the both of as we were the first to arrive and Dustin (#Mixologist), gave us the lowdown about the menu.  Honestly, they were so nice we felt we were \"red carpet\" guests.   We placed our order and enjoyed some ice tea while we waited for our food.  The turkey sausage breakfast sandwich is just right. The warm brioche bread hugging eggs and sausage with some jack cheese is probably anyone's go to favorite.   The one detail I noticed is when you bite into the sandwich, the yolk is still soft leaving you with this nice warm golden gravy! Yum!  The scramble is another one that may another favorite for anyone. Fluffy scrambled eggs, caramelized onions and brioche bread is a great combo, what brings it in for this cool morning was the gentle Sriracha mayo that gives the right bit of heat.  Lastly, The Toast called The Morning Razzle. Buttery toasted bread topped with Nutella and raspberry jam!  If you like sweets in the morning like I do, then this could be your option!  Seating is on their patio next to the restaurant, parking is also available.  If you're in downtown Fremont stop by, have a seat, enjoy some coffee and a breakfast sandwich while you watch the world go by.  :)",

The people in the back of the house clearly know what they're doing. The front of the house, however, was weak. Our waitress was slow, and irritable, and I don't think it's an isolated bad apple. This is actually the second time we've been here, the first time we cancelled our order ASAP and left after it took someone 25 minutes to come over to our table and acknowledge our existence.",

We did get ID before entering, so it looks like it is 21 and over only. We wanted to chill in the front area and downtown people watch as dined and got our drink on.  We perused the laid back backyard.  Its like a backyard BBQ get together in there.    I ordered the Unicorn for my drink, and it was like sipping on basil/mint water, it was that refreshing!  I haven't been served alcohol in a mason jar in such a long time, what a nice country feeling.  I'm curious to try their bloody mary with hard boiled egg..wasn't in the mood that day, but next time Im willing to try it.  I also tried the fried chicken and waffle sandwich.  Its a crispy boneless chicken breast between thick waffles that is drizzled in maple syrup.  It was yummy and filling, I didn't even finish everything.  Not too many items on the food menu, but I would categorized this place more for chillin' and relaxing with the homies type of place.   Awesome spot to start off the night when you are in downtown.",

I had never been here yet, so I was hoping this place wouldn't disappoint. It didn't.  I ordered The Unicorn, which is one of their signature cocktails made with Ketel One Citron Vodka, lemon juice, simple syrup, mint, ginger beer, and a lemon wedge. I'd definitely have it again. Next time I'll try some of the other signature cocktails, but at the very least I know I can rely on The Unicorn to fulfill my needs. The prices here are fair. The bartender was attentive and friendly.  The space is very cozy, but they make good use of the little footprint they have. Be sure to check out the outdoor patio in the back. If you weren't aware of it, it would be easy to not even realize it exists. You'd be missing out if you didn't.",

    "text": "It seems like Park on Fremont is the place to be when other places are wall-to-wall filled on days like First Friday or perhaps any other weekend. This is the spot to resort to when you're trying to escape from the loud thumping music or the obnoxious young \"I wanna get drunk!\" crowd Downtown tends to attract with their newest attractions. (God I sound old when I said that)  Park is low-key. You can actually enjoy cocktails (I advise you to try a Bloody Mary) or the usual call drinks and beers while being able to conversate with your friends no matter where you're at. Whether you're in the front lawn people watching or in the back cozying up next to the fireplace or on the see-saw, Park definitely recreates a different setting in comparison to the other bars on Fremont Street. I LOVE AND PREFER IT, especially when you're actually trying to catch up with your friends while being hungry at the same time.  And yes, this place offers food! I've had a couple things off their menu and everything is mediocre at it's finest but very good at the moment when you're trying to sober up. I wouldn't ever come here just for the food (in my opinion) but this is the place I'd choose to be Downtown if my friends left it up to me.  I'm starting to assume Park is never as crowded as the other places due to the prices but hey, I wouldn't mind spending an extra buck or two keeping my sanity than to fight over a place to stand avoiding my drink to be spilled due to some intoxicated bimbo trying hard to seem sober while navigating to the bathroom every hour. And you know how they say \"You are who you surround yourself with\"? Well Park is definitely my kind of the socializing in a sophisticated yet fun manner crowd.   PS: Four stars for the lack of service since it's not as attentive as a service establishment should be and more of a \"let me take your order and dip\" without checking back to see if we want another round which steers us to overcrowd the bar instead. I hate to be that person that does that but when your server is close to nonexistent then you're left with no other choice. Sorry.",

The fish tacos were delicious however not included in the happy hour. The steak tacos were tender meat and just the right of ratio for condiments. The drinks were affordable. I am a sucker for a beer in a mason glass. The women restroom the trash was over flowed there was paper in both sinks making it kinda gross washing my hands but the stalls were clean. The decor of the place is super cute. Some very nice art. We ordered 2 orders of tacos and the second order never came. It was pretty disappointing since we both were starving.

They took off for Don't Tell Mama and reported back that they were served immediately. Jessica C. and I decided to suffer through the wait with our parched palates and carry on. It was a poor decision and we should have left with the other three.   The bartenders were busy, Park was busy. That is a fact but not an excuse. If you can't execute under pressure you are in the wrong business.   They get 2 stars for the beer selection and garden. But that doesn't matter.   Yuck.",

I wanted to order a girly drink like sangria but they don't make it, so I just ordered a burger + sweet tater tots and it wasn't that great.   Also trying to have some sort of conversation was impossible because the noise level of this joint is extremely loud to say the least. I did like the music and decor but the food + noise makes it a negative for me to actually enjoy hanging here.  Overall I'd say that POF is a great joint to hook up with a friend or 2 over drinks at the bar for about 20 minutes but that's it.... or maybe hang out at the bar for as long as it takes to find an interesting person to leave to another joint with.  Also parking will cost you $20 and that's just too pricey unless you car pool and split the cost. I got out of paying for it because the lot owner and I have a friend in common which is the guy who helped build common wealth across the street... Hooray for me!",

Our original destination of insert coins was closed. After walking a bit I saw Park On Fremont and decided to check it out from the happy hour board outside. We were seated in the back. It wasn't that busy of a night and it took over 20 minutes for our server to even acknowledge us and give us water.   I look over the happy hour menu and ask a few questions. Turns out the drinks for happy hour are NOT the same size as the regular counterparts in the menu. Same goes for the food choices.   The food was tasty, saving this experience. I had the Philly cheese steak and a friend had the sliders which were good as well. The drinks were tasty, but I don't know if they are 10 dollar craft cocktail tasty. After we were done eating , the waitress apologizes and gives us 2 of the 5$ special drinks for the trouble. Nice gesture, but the damage was done.   All in all, service was lacking majorly and just not a \"I want to be at work\" vibe from the staff. Almost a point for the see saw in the secret back area though.",

Ordered 3 waters for the table so we would have water when we arrived. Waitress brought 1 water. We arrived and waited a good 7-8 minutes for the server to come take our drink/food order. Drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive (not kidding). I hate, hate, hate waiting on service especially when the server doesn't acknowledge the wait. I was very ready to walk off but was looking forward to trying the food and my options were limited at that point with the amount of time I had before I had to go to work.  Ordered the fried chicken and waffle sandwich... it was really good. Both were cooked just the way I like it and I would absolutely order again. Sweet potato tots were as good as expected... I find I never really can complain about anything sweet potato.  Blue Moon in a can.... didn't offer me a glass or an orange slice. Defeats the purpose of a blue moon to me.  Horrible service... seemed like they had one server for about 10 tables. It was not a Tuesday afternoon... it was a Saturday night!!! Pretty sure there were more girls at the host stand then they had serving.  Decor is cool and outside seating is a huge plus. Love people watching downtown!",

We sat out in the front to people watch since it was NYE evening and many people were headed towards Fremont St.  We started out with the \"Sampler\" which is a sampler of 4 drink items, craft beer and/ or specialty cocktails.  I don't remember exactly what we ordered but we asked the server which 2 beers she recommended, we got a dark hazelnut beer and a light beer similar to a blonde (a Sacramento brew). We also ordered the \"trophy wife\" and the \"unicorn\" all were good but the cocktails may have been more enjoyable on a hot summer day rather than a cold winter night.  Either way we finished everything.  We also ordered the Garbage fries and chicken bites.  The garbage fries didn't feel greasy with a whole bunch of junk piled on like I've had at other places and I didn't feel all nasty and like I hated life afterwards.  The chicken bites were large pieces of juicy chicken, more of a 2-3 bite chicken served with sauces.  If they had more sauces or 1 really good dipping sauce (a la raising canes) it would be on point +1 !  Either way I was happy with everything ordered.  Will definitely return, and try their bloody Marys! *do not miss the beer garden in the back, it's \"F*cking Beautiful\"",

My husband accidentally knocked my fresh plate of food on the floor and our waiter came over right away to tell us he put my order in again free of charge without us even asking. Awesome service. The garbage fries will be the only thing you crave for a week after having them!!",

For a bar downtown isn't 1130p kind of early for a lot of foot traffic out and about?",

The chicken and waffle sandwich is neat in concept and plays well with the finger food mentality of the place. The drawback comes in the fact that the waffle was almost soggy and lukewarm. The chicken is nothing impressive. The choice of sides are decent. We went with the potato salad and it was good. They use egg in the mixture and that was very good. As the night progressed I ordered the veggie pita wrap with a side of sweet potato tots. This was better. The warm pita stuffed full with cheese and a variety of grilled vegetables was much better. The fact that they were removing items from their menu left us with little to choose from kind of hindered the dining experience.  The garden seating is amazing due to its Alice in Wonderland-esque decor. I would love to go back and take everything in. Hopefully the menu will be hashed out by then.",

We had a couple of weirdo's come and talk to us, but that's what you get when you sit outside! For dinner, we ordered the grilled vegetable pita with the sweet potato tots side and a side salad. My salad was OK. Definitely could have been more tomato and cucumbers. The dressing was OK too. The grilled veggie pita was OK. I've definitely had better, but I did enjoy. The service was good. Not only did our waitress ask us multiple times if we needed anything else, other waiters did too. It wasn't to push us out at all, just making sure we had what we needed. They have vegan veggie sliders on the menu and maybe I'd try them next time. I didn't try any drinks so I couldnt tell you about them.",

    "text": "This was the best meal I've had in any of my trips to Vegas.  It would fit right into my rotation if it were located in the Boston area.    The space was cute and the decorating elements work well, though if you're someone that likes to sneer at \"hipster bullshit\" you may find your face sore by the end of your visit.  I'm neutral on the hipster thing, and everyone was polite and friendly, so who cares how they decorate.  The back patio was a great find on our 2nd visit at the end of the night as we waited for our reservation for The Laundry Room.  The drinks are a nice mix of craft cocktails, and some standbys.  The food was perfect.  We split an order of chicken and waffles and the veggie sliders, with sweet potato tots and potato salad on the side.  I was so over the Vegas excess thing on our last day that I was incredibly grateful for well-prepared food in reasonable portions.  The veggie sliders were absolute heaven, and the perfect amount of food for how I felt that day.  My husband was all over the chicken and waffles, and loved the drink menu.  (He originally wanted to go to the Heart Attack Grill, until he realized they made you wear those gross hospital gowns.  I'm thankful he saved me from that experience)  I wish I could pick this place up and move it to my own neighborhood.  It really was a breath of fresh air, just off the end of the Fremont St Experience area.  Go!",

The garbage fries were also not as good as the first time.  The eggs was undercooked, the jalapenos were nonexistant, and the flavour was overall meh.  I ordered a draft beer for happy hour only to find out when I got the bill that they wouldn't honor the happy hour prices.  On top of that is the tendency of the staff to just abandon you, so there is nothing to come back for.",

The veggie roll was good but definitely messy and hard to eat. The turkey burger was nothing special. I enjoyed \"the unicorn\" mixed drink, but for $9 it seemed very weak. There appeared to only be one waitress working and she had the inside tables and the patio. We watched the bartender chat up some people at the bar during the 20 min we were waiting for our drinks, then once he finally made them, they just sat there waiting on the server to pick them up. With all the bright lights and signs on Fremont, this place was kind of hard to find because it's not well distinguished compared to most other places. The taxidermy behind the bar was cool, the decor was very Victorian, but when you looked closer at the pictures on the walls, most were either bizarre taxidermy art or very unsettling, distorted old pictures of people. Maybe this is cool to the zombie loving, hipster crowd, but it was kind of weird and disturbinging to look at while eating dinner.",

    "text": "Street parking $2 an hour   This place is decent if you're in the area, but I wouldn't go out of my way for. Personally, the items on the menu didn't draw my attention, then I saw the chalk board with $7 deep fried Oreos with vanilla ice cream which I ordered. It came with 5 Oreos and 1 spoon sized ice cream \"scoop\", not sure why they don't just give the traditional scoop. The Oreos were great and there's not many places you can get that around Vegas so plus for that. But, the ice cream is barely enough to eat with every cookie. My party enjoyed the Garbage Tots and Breakfast wrap, but not the Chicken and Waffles. The Fried Chicken looked good, but it was dry. You could get a better piece of chicken at Raising Canes or Chick Fil A. Their mimosa was delicious though, $25 for a bottle of champagne and OJ. Btw, service can be lacking. We had our cash with the bill ready, but no one seemed inclined to pick it up.",

The server recommended them as a popular choice, although not a personal favorite. While the flavors were interesting, the sprouts were undercooked, under roasted, and therefore way too hearty, and the sauce in the bottom of the skillet tasted like apples soaked in cologne. They also left the little stems intact which is unappetizing. We waited about 5 minutes to be acknowledged at the host's stand, and it took almost 40 minutes for wraps and undercooked Brussels sprouts. Cool spot on Fremont, just not that great of an experience.",

The music is good, the lighting isn't blinding, the drinks are strong and crafty, and the decor is classic and trendy. Good spot to start your bar crawl in Downtown vegas.   oddly enough - there's a bunch of paintings of animals in fancy frames, as well as a mounted \"golden\" buck's head with machine guns for antlers. it's like the brainchild of a Taxidermist/Typographer or something. anyway, Cheers!  -civilities.",

    "text": "Experience:  came here with a group of folks to try out Taco Tuesday's. I've been here many times before, and this is my favorite bar, so I guess it deserves a review finally.   Facility: this is a very eclectic, quirky, fun bar.  The artwork is weird, but makes for a great conversation piece every time I come. There is outside seating in front of the bar, in case you want to people watch everyone on Fremont. There is bar seating directly inside and even a few booths.  Out back there is an amazing private garden, and this is my favorite spot.  It has greenery, cool art, and a fireplace. There is even a small smoking area behind it with a working heavy duty see saw for grown ups.  We sat out here, because it was a pretty nice evening, but for those that had a chill, they even had those portable heaters that look like a light pole to move to your table.   Service:  most of the time I have great service here.  With our big group last night, there was one waiter that was a little pushy about clearing the plates. I appreciate someone asking \"Is there anything I can take?\", but he kept specifically asking for each plate on the table, \"can I take this?\", then on to the next one, \"Can I take this?\"  When people are talking and drinking, they tend to pick, so just leave the food. He even went so far as to say in response to someone saying, \"Is there still some in there\", as he was removing it...\"It's cold, are you going to eat it like that?\"  Well, not after you called it out at the whole table like that! Anyway, besides that guy, the staff is courteous, helpful and attentive.   Food and drinks:  they have this yummy grapefruit beer I get every time I go. I started out drinking the $1 beers on special last night, but be warned, they are only 7oz mini bottle beers. They are so cute though. They said they ran out of Dos XX, so they served Sol instead. Then they ran out of Sol and they magically had Dos XX again. LOL!  Anyway, I ended up switching back to my grapefruit after a while.  We ordered the $2 tacos, which were small, but pretty tasty, especially after I ordered some jalapenos to top them off with.  Then we ordered a mix of appetizers from the happy hour, such as garbage fries, fried pickles and Mac and cheese balls. All of them were good bar food. The garbage fries are really good with a bunch of topping such as cheese, fresh jalapenos, avocado, bacon, and a sunny side up egg on top. Yum!  Overall:  I love this bar. Between the cool atmosphere, good bar food, and grapefruit beer, I will continue to come back.",

We don't come to Vegas often, but would definitely come again next time we're in town. I personally love the weird symmetry photos but my personal favorite was the horses getting friendly!

Not so much fun, especially because the seating out there is all hard metal stools and tables at uncomfortable heights. That said, the food and drinks were good, and the service was attentive (even with a party of 7). We had both vegans and vegetarians in our group and everyone found something they liked on the menu, so that says something. Would love to try it again when the weather is warmer or if they'd spread out the heaters a bit more.",

    "text": "This place is great!  A few friends and took a quick trip to Vegas and stayed at the Golden Nugget.  A co-worker recommended Park on Fremont for great drinks and food in downtown LV.  He was spot on.  The drink menu is great - I couldn't resist the Unicorn (ginger beer, absolut citron, mint, simple syrup, Im missing something...) which was a little sweet but easy drinking.  My friends opted for the shot and beer. The food was pretty damn good, too.  They offer a great variety of options for carnivores and vegetarians.  I tried the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots.  The sliders were very good with whole wheat buns and a great citrus sauce.  The tots are very different that regular tater tots - sweet sprinkled with cinnamon and very reminiscent of doughnuts.  I'm on the fence about 'em.  I just wasn't in the mood for sweet, should have ordered fries instead to satisfy that craving.  The sriracha/ketchup blend was a perfect accompaniment to the tots, a little spice and a ton of flavor really balanced the sweetness of the tots.  A great alternative to the usual douchy LV Strip bars.  The atmosphere is great, lots of locals and a younger crowd, outdoor seating.  Great art, a ton of stuffed birds behind the bard, and a beautiful Mark Ryden print by the kitchen.  Super friendly staff.  Our waitress couldn't have been better.  She was super nice and very attentive, gave us her recommendations, which we tried, and was just overall fantastic.  I didn't catch her name but I wish I had so I could properly compliment her service (petitie asian gal with a bright, friendly smile).",

We were seated in the beautiful patio in the back so i had hopes for a very pleasant experience again. Oh to dream.  My friend ordered a grilled cheese and apparently they no longer make that but it's on the menu.  I had to be wild and crazy and order iced tea just to find out they don't carry iced tea.   We changed our orders and i ordered a burger with cheese and mushrooms.  When it arrived, it had avocado on it.  I thought i had forgotten to tell the server to leave it off the burger but when i reread the menu, it didn't say it had avocado.  I waited about 8 minutes and flagged down the food runner since our server was no where in sight.  I then asked her to have it removed and she told me she had ordered the wrong burger for me.  When my burger finally arrives, it had a very small amount of cheese but the mushrooms and bacon were no where to be found. I actually took it apart to verify they weren't hiding somewhere and nope, no mushrooms.  Needless to say, i will not be returning to eat.  Maybe i'll give you guys a try for a cocktail but after that fiasco i'll have to let the memory fade and hope that time heals all.",

Happy hour had $4 domestics and $5 crafts. I ordered an Angry Orchard. Was charged SEVEN dollars. I asked why and was told it wasn't included. Paid the $7 and was asked to give another dollar because it was $8. They come in little mason jars which looks cute but isn't even a normal class of beer. Just ridiculous. In every other bar in America, Angry Orchard is considered a domestic. Bartender could also save the attitude. There's plenty of other amazing places in the area with the same hip vibe.

    "text": "I'm a local here in Las Vegas. My husband and I are big supporters of small business especially since we are business owners ourselves. We've been to PoF many times and I've hosted quite a few lady brunches there.  On 8/8/15 we met up with some friends who are from out of town. We suggested that we all go to PoF to avoid a lot of the drama and crazies you encounter downtown. We arrive and a heavy set African man asked to see our id's in such a manner that it already set a bad tone for our friends new experience there.  We then go sit in the back yard and wait for 17 minutes. Nobody came by. We tried to ask a female server with her head shaved on the sides of she could serve us or send someone else and she responded with your not in my section. She acted like we insulted her by U.S. Asking for service. I ask my husband to go inside with his friend  to the bar and get us drinks. My girlfriend and I are waiting for another 15 minutes. We go inside to find the bouncers harassing our husbands claiming that they broke a light fixture in the men's bathroom. They took there id's and called the police. We go outside to wait for metro and as we are waiting the bouncers and the hostesses are antagonizing us. Acting like children. The heavier set African American man even went as far as sticking his tongue out at us. Yes.. You read that correct.. A grown man acting literally like a toddler. After metro showed up they couldn't pin the broken light fixture on my husband. They had him in handcuffs and everything. I asked for all the employees names that were outside taunting us and they refused. I have never in all my years living in Vegas have dealt with such unprofessional staff. I will do my best to let all of our friends in the art community, entertainment community and out of towners to avoid this business. I highly recommend the owners train the staff to act like civilized humans instead of animals. If any of my employees behaved in such a manner I would fire them on the spot. Also I will be conducting an investigation to get all of these staff members names and will update my yelp review with this information. Please avoid this place.",

    "text": "If I could give this establishment ZERO stars, I would. This was my third time dining at Park. It is Halloween night, everywhere is busy. My friends and I work at a casino on the strip and we decided we wanted to go have some food and something to drink to celebrate the holiday. We are locals and we can choose to go anywhere in this wonderful city, yet we chose Park. We ordered pretty much one of everything from the appetizer menu and we each had one cocktail. I would say total-we spent cumulatively around $150. The time was about 2:20am when we wrapped up, finished paying, and said our goodbyes at the entrance. I had to use the restroom and so did my roommate, so after hugging our friends goodbye I tried to walk back through the front entrance to use their restroom but I was abruptly stopped by the bouncer-Louie-or at least that was the name he gave us. He informed me that I could not go back inside because they were closing (they close at 3am and it is now 2:25am). At first I thought he was joking, so I smiled at him and continued to take a step forward. He placed his complete body in front of me and screamed in my face \"DID YOU NOT HEAR ME? WE ARE CLOSING\" I am naturally a pretty calm person so I said, \"well, we just had dinner here. Are you going to tell me that a paying customer may not use your restroom facilities?\" He then waved his arms in the air and continued to scream like a maniac toward everyone out front of the establishment \"OH, YEAH, FINE!! EVERYONE COME ON IN!! WE DON'T WANT TO GO HOME\" The manager was standing right there next to him and she did absolutely nothing. Since when is it okay to treat people like this? I literally just ate dinner here and you are not going to let me go pee? While he was having his conniption fit, I walked passed him and headed to the back of the restaurant-which was full of people by the way-and went to the restroom. I turned to see my roommate behind me. Good. So, we went to the bathroom and when we got out I noticed a part of the Park that I had never seen before. As I mentioned earlier, this was my third (and last!) time coming here, however I had never used the restroom and therefore never saw this garden back porch they have. My roommate, having been there more frequently than I, told me about a \"see-saw\" room as well. We started to walk through the crowd of people in the back of the restaurant to see this \"see-saw\" room. When we got back there, it was just that. An adult sized see-saw. How fun right? So, I jump on one side and she is on the other and we teetered and tottered a few times and I had almost completely forgotten how rude the security up front was. We then asked another patron to take our photo. Just as he was about to take it the manager (a lady) came back and said to my roommate and I \"you two that were (and she used air quotes) just using the bathroom-you have to leave NOW!\" And I said, \"okay we are about to leave, we just want to take a picture\". And she screamed at us as if we were her four year old children, \"YOU NEED TO LEAVE NOOOOW!!!!\" And again, I said, \"we will leave after we take the picture\". So she threatened me saying she would call security and I said as calm as ever, \"please do\". I really just wanted her to walk away so we could take the damn picture. She then threatened us by saying she was going to call Metro. All of this harassment from the manager was in a matter of 1-3 minutes. It was still not 3am, which is their \"closing time\". As we got off the see-saw, Louie was there again staring at us with eyes like daggers. I'm sure the upper management would be thrilled to know how the employees at Park treat paying customers. I've never been so appalled in my life. From the security out front not allowing paying customers to use their restroom facilities and then yelling about how he wants to go home, meanwhile the manager is just standing there allowing that type of behavior. I have worked in the hospitality industry for over a decade and no matter how annoying or rude or wrong a customer is, I have never-ever treated another human being that way. Where is your work ethic Park? Why do you treat paying customers like you are doing them a favor by letting them come inside? Park has the most unfriendly and rude staff I have ever encountered. I have never written a Yelp review before but this experience was so appalling that I felt compelled to. People should not treat other people this way! Especially managers! You have an example to set. Shame on you both!",

I love it inside: great juke box, great service, and too many chandeliers in the hallway (and who doesn't love that?) oh yeah, and those filthy birds, my fav!   But on a less positive note, I have never tasted anything else that I liked.  The fried chicken & waffle sandwiches I've eaten both nearly brought tears of joy to my eyes.  The rest of the menu........closer to just plain old tears... [Tip:  Avoid the Cuban sandwich: most boring sandwich in captivity.]",

There was nowhere to sit so we had to go outside which was okay because they had the heaters going. But was kind of annoyed because one of those tables was being used by an employee rolling up napkins and forks. Maybe it's me but I think that should be done somewhere behind the scenes especially when you lack seating. I will in this on a good note the interior is pretty cool the front door man is very courteous and respectful",

    "text": "Food: I am not a fan of pickles but their deep fried pickles are amazing! I went for lunch and the food is about $10-$15 but portions are pretty big and delicious. First time I went I had the Philly Mac and Cheese steak which was scrumptious. The second time I went I had the chicken bites which weren't as good. The chicken was tough and stringy and the corn flake batter wasn't a good texture. I would still go back  but I would try something else.   Atmosphere: Very fun and interesting. They have a lot of artwork and pieces that are a great topic of conversation. It could be thought of as a little creepy. Behind the bar, directly in front of seating is a wall filled with taxidermy birds which really freaked me out since I am scared of birds. Even though, I love their food so I try to look down or at my lunch companions.   I also know that there is an outdoor area which I heard was great at night but I haven't made my way back there yet. Indoor seating has about 5-6 tables of 4 on the inside and quite a bit of bar seating. It would be hard for a large party of 8 or more to sit together if you just walked in for lunch time.",

We contemplated God's grace in the presence of the fine artwork on the back patio, and rejoiced in the glorious food! We sat out back on a chilly evening, but the propane heaters kept us warm enough. Great beer selection and all of us enjoyed the food! Favorites included the Mac and Philly Cheesesteak, the Chicken and Waffle sandwich (all that bacon!), and of course, the tots! Thanks for a nearly divine evening!",

    "text": "I Was downtown at lunchtime and thought I was walking into a pizza place. Was seated quick and the waiter took our drink order quickly. (Passion Ice tea) Good vibes, good music most of the time  business people at lunch not many tourist . I'm local so I'm good with that.   The restaurant has a really cool look. Copper tables, barstools, foot rails  every thing looked hand made. With saloon style wallpaper on the ceiling and some really cool hunting art on the walls my favorite piece was the stuffed deer head with gold punk rock spiked antlers that curved into 2 Gold machine guns. Yes machine guns And a painted cartoon style rendition of lady gaga in her meat dress.   it wasn't till I couldn't find pizza on the small menu as the waiter was taking our order and when I asked he said no that's next door. (awkward) I thought park on Fremont was where you park. ( lol) So I scanned quickly as my friend ordered a cheese burger, Fries and Mac and cheese balls. I got the cajun chicken sandwich and fries with extra seasoning. The food was pretty good the chicken had just enough Cajun seasoning. Juicy chicken my friends burger was really good he had not had a burger in awhile so it was a treat for him fries were good and the Mac and cheese balls are delicious with a little bacon and taste home made. My friend don't eat pork and ate 4 of them. For dessert i had to have a doughnut ice cream sandwich. You gotta try one of these. Off the charts. Check was about 39 bucks + a 20% tip .    Nothing worth taking a star away for. It was a good experience overall. And I will take my wife and pictures next time I go.   Ps the pizza place next store was out of business.",

    "text": "Customer service is of utmost importance if you are running a restaurant. This place has none.  Went on 11/6 with a friend to this restaurant. My friend said she had had the food here and recommended it. Before you walk in, you get attitude from the bouncer. He stared at my ID like it was fake, even flipped it around to check the back in a way that indicated that he didn't think it was real (I'm 24 and don't look underage). Also, ignored my friends request to just see her ID in the wallet.  We sit in the back patio area and waited. And waited. And waited. Finally I go to the bar and ask the bartender if there's a server that's supposed to come around or if we are supposed to order at the bar.   Bartender: \"Did someone sit you down back there?\"  Me: \"No we just sat down back there\"  Bartender: \"Oh yeah, if you weren't seated then no server is going to come to you. We don't have servers just walking around\"  Me: \"Can you please send someone out there for us?\"  Bartender: \"Sure\"  And you know how this ends. No one ever showed up. Plus, walking out, there's a sign that says, \"Please seat yourself.\" So why the bartender thought anyone would sit us down is beyond me. I'm sure the food there is probably okay, but I'll never know.  I won't be going here again, the service is just terrible. I can only imagine how awful it would have been if someone ACTUALLY had taken time to taken our order.",

The server was pleasant but oblivious to the fact that we'd waited forever.  The \"homemade chili\" was pretty weak, but passable. The Philly cheesesteak with macaroni was a unique idea that could have worked. The steak and pepper mix was excellent (but paltry) and the macaroni passable, but the 4 to 1 bread to everything else ratio ruined this. After all this, our \"appetizer\" arrived (LOL). It was macaroni balls which the server recommended. They were pretty good. Would have been even better before the entree.  This restaurant has a lot of potential, but they need to work out their service issues first.",

You are supposed to get a deal for happy hour, that is the whole point of it. They really had us scratching our heads when they gave us the discounted price, but then served us a mini version of the normal size drink! So, you are paying less, but also getting a lot less! It's insane! Not a deal!  So Park, I suggest doing a real happy hour menu, instead of serving customers those stupid mini-sized drinks and pretending that is some kind of bargain. People are better off paying full price and getting a decent sized drink. That is not what happy hour is, and definitely not making anyone happy!",

I love the decor, it is creepy and dark and reminds me of well done places such as The Act, Bootsy Bellows, or Voyer in San Diego.   Sadly what is lacking at this spot is the service.  I don't blame the staff.  It is as if someone running the restaurant has not previous food and beverage experience. They could do a higher volume if they were staffed properly.    For example, after the Neon Run, which ended in front of Park.  I was on the back patio.  It was full of runners who were hungry and thirsty.  There was one girl working the back.  She was cranky from being frazzled.  I had bottled water and since I was dying after my run, I pulled it out to drink while I waited to put in my order. I took one swig and security that was on the patio came and took it from me.  Wearily I said, \"I'm so thirsty and I just ran.\"    \"Sorry no outside drinks.\"  He said and took it from my hand.  I was to tired to protest.  I watched as he walked the entire patio, which was full of runners, and took water from everyone.  I couldn't believe that with all of us they couldn't have made a slight exception.  My suspicion is that if they would have been staffed appropriately for the rush after the race we could have all had waters on our table.    They need to work on training staff better for customer service, and to staff better for times when there are events downtown.",

I had the 'San Diego burger' (I think that's what it was, but I can't seem to find their menu anywhere. it had avocado on it) with some sweet potato tots.  I also shared the fried pickles with my lovely dining partner, since I am a discerning fried pickle eater.    Beer selection was great, decor/atmosphere was great - make sure to check out the patio out back.  I wasn't in love with my burger, though.. I didn't find it particularly flavorful - the meat especially didn't stand out to me.  Also, I did not like the tots that much.. being sweet potato they were covered in cinnamon, which is fine and complimented the taste, but.. they were small and not that crispy or fluffy.  I would have liked a bigger sized tot, for sure - and maybe something like a drizzle of honey on them?  I don't know.. also, the sauce that they were served with did not go at all.. I kept trying it but was not into it.    As for the fried pickles.. I liked the batter they used (although I would have liked it a little thicker and/or maybe with a little cornmeal mixed in?) and they were fried properly.  I did not like the pickles on the inside.. I know they were homemade but they were barely pickled.. I expect my fried pickles to be very pickled and super classic dill-pickle style.  These were hipster fried pickles, take that as you may...  I would come back here for drinks and give a chance to some other things on the menu.. maybe I just didn't find the right thing yet - it *is* a cool spot.",

Yet despite the bizarre art motif the food is all good, the drink combos are top notch and the atmosphere is quality! They have a teeter-totter! They have glorious sweet potato tater tos, and it's relatively easy to get a reservation.   I like it here.",

There wasn't a wait or anything, so we were seated and water was given to us fairly quickly. We sat in the back patio, which was beautiful. The only thing was, there was a smell emitting from the building itself that smelled of sewage. Another complaint of mine was the smoking area. Why was it located all the way in the back and why the heck is there a teeter totter? The waitress seemed annoyed that she was working there, but nonetheless, the food was awesome. We ordered the mac and cheesesteak and a side of fried pickles. The fried pickles could of used more \"pickles\" than fried peppercinis and the music could of been turned down more.The food is fairly priced at the location that it's at and the drinks were cold and refreshing. FYI, don't bring kids here. Unless you want them to be in a steam punk nightmare. And another FYI...the paper towels in the bathroom are camoflauged into the wall. :)",

Our group works in show business here and would be coming after shows.  Whoever answered the phone a week ago said they would make a reservation for me to ensure staffing. I called to double check yesterday morning and there was no reservation, nor enough staff. After discussing this with Julie, my understanding was that they would be staffed, and would take care of our large group who loved this bar. Also discussed was that on their site it states open till 3am. We would definitely be there till at least 2. She stated they usually close at 1 on Tuesdays but if there was business they stay open. Great!  Nope. I arrived to last call at 12:20am, a bar of 30+ people (almost ALL) were our group and an obstinate and ridiculous manager stating no one was there at 11:30p like the reservation said ( not True as well) so they were going to close. CLOSE WITH A FULL BAR AND MORE COMING.  Unacceptable.  We left immediately, deciding to give our money and very loyal patronage to #donttellmama across the street.  Worst manager ever. Owners will be contacted.  As long as Julie is the manager, take your business elsewhere. #parkonfremont",

    "text": "Probabaly the worst service I have had in awhile. Our server who didn't even tell us her name took about 10 minutes to greet us, when she brought out our Mimosas she forgot the cups. So we had to wait again just for that. So an hour into sitting down we still hadn't received our food and other tables that were sat after us are already eating and finishing up. Our server didn't even come over to check on us so we had to ask another person who was the \"manager\" and finally our server comes over to tell us \"something happened\" but it shouldn't be much longer. So it's 1:05 right now and mind you we got there at noon and we just got our food, it was cold. What a surprise. It tasted like it was sitting under a light because our server forgot about it. So we ask to talk to the \"manager\" and with very little obvious interest she asks what's wrong and we inform her of our situation and to which she replies \"she's busy\" WOW thank you so much. (It honestly seemed like she didn't want to talk to us because we were the only minority's there. which if that were the case shame on them).SO we have been waiting an HOUR and that's all you can say. No sorry, no i understand your frustration just \"she's busy\" and if she was that busy then why didn't another server help her out? Not very nice of her coworkers. Honestly the worst server and manager did not care at all. And to top if off the food was mediocre. If I could give this place a zero I would. It's only popular because of the aesthetic.",

The bar is very cool the way it's half indoor and half outdoor. On a cool Vegas night, you can't beat the ambiance this bar has.   I had a Big Dog's Red Hydrant Ale (local beer) on draft for $7.  I also had a couple $10 beer + shot deals, Dogfish Head 90 minute IPA, red velvet shot, and a cinnamon shot.  Given the location, these are not bad prices at all, and for quality drinks no less. Did not try the food. I also hear there's a seesaw in the back patio area, I will have to check that out next time.",

I got the fish taco of the appetizer section of the menu thinking it was small enough to be an appetizer, they ended up being given 3 normal sized fish tacos, but they were so good, I could have eaten another order.   Stuffed from my fish tacos I still had my meal coming, I got the Philly mac n cheese steak sandwich, simply put, it's a cheese steak sandwich with \"mac n cheese\" as the cheese. It was very good. It came with fries and those were awesome also.  My wife got French Toast, she said they were a little soggy from the fruit put on top of it, but nonetheless the meal was good. They don't offer a breakfast potato on the menu, but they were nice enough to specially make some for my wife, so she was happy.   It was a little expensive, but we both left stuffed and happy, which doesn't happen often when we go out to eat, especially on East Fremont.",

    "text": "A security guard, bald and big guy named Louie (I believe his name was) and a woman manager with brown hair, short with glasses were spiteful to me and my girlfriend. It was Halloween night and me and my coworkers wanted to have a nice night out so we chose to have a quick late meal here paired with drinks. Later they wanted to go home so we said our goodbyes at the front then needed to use the restroom so proceeded to the front doors. I noticed the security guard arguing with my friend who politely mentioned she needed to use the restroom and was a paying customer and he loudly made a scene about how they were closed and mocked her.   All while the manager was standing near, not doing anything. I understand it was getting late and close to closing time but it was around 2:30am mind you, they close at 3am plus there were about 20 something people inside the establishment. Soon after we ended up using restroom and I noticed people at the back courtyard area so I didn't see a big deal to step foot and show my friend the seesaw room really quick. We found a nice guy who was with his group of friends and asked him to take a photo. But was immediately interrupted by the woman manager who seemed to follow us and said we cannot take the photo and demanded us to leave. How spiteful of her to choose to pick on us in front of other guests. The guy holding my camera was flabbergasted at the manager and said \"that was really rude,\" and took the photos of us anyway. I just wanted to show my friend a room she's never seen before and figured it would change her upset mood over the security guard incident. And didn't see the big deal of taking a quick look before we headed out, in addition there were still a lot people! The manager threatened to call metro, we were so polite I didn't feel that was necessary. Not even 3am yet. Both the security guard and manager felt the need to argue with us and make a seen in front of other paying customers. Had they known we are in the hospitality business too, I've also written content about Las Vegas venues and \"Things to Do\" around Vegas, and my friend was looking into Park for her wedding reception, would they have treated us better? Regardless, you don't treat others this way.",

    "text": "Stopped by First Friday at the beginning of this month. 1 star is for the nice bartender in the back outdoors who had an extremely limited bar, but was friendly and nice. Granted it was a really busy night and it was one of the few places that weren't charging people to get in. (Seriously DTLV?)   My boyfriend and I sat ourselves at the largest table available in the main room, yeah it was only 2 of us at the time of seating, but we were waiting for 2 others to join us. We sat around for 10 minutes, while all the waitresses ran around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know if their manager doesn't know how to properly assign sections (with them running in and out of the room to the back, but it seemed like they could barely handle the large volume of people). We waited and waited, made eye contact with several people and still no service. I urged my boyfriend to go up to one of them at a computer putting an order in, and she proceeds to tell him that she's \"cut.\" First of all, I'm a server at a high volume restaurant on the strip and I completely understand how annoying it can be when you're super busy and the last thing you want is to add another thing to do to your list of many, but how hard is it to tell a customer, \"let me find a waitress/server who can help you.\" ??? Not that f*ing difficult.   I was pissed and got up myself, looked for someone who would be standing around doing NOTHING (usually managers) sure enough I saw a gentleman standing behind the bar just people watching and walked directly to him and asked him if there were any servers serving the tables in the area because we had yet to be acknowledged. He pretended to act surprised as if he himself didn't see us either, and pointed at the girl... where else, AT THE COMPUTER. Hmmm, really?? All I wanted was to order drinks, shots and a side of french fries. EASY! I'm not a tough customer especially when I can tell people are overwhelmed. She drops our shots off (chocolate cake) no lemons and no sugar. I'm not a bartender, but I'm sure everyone knows they come with both. We ask her for both, walks away. Comes back with a few lemons in a cup and 2 packets of sugar and tosses them on the table and walks away. LITERALLY WALKED AWAY. No, \"is there anything else i can get you?\" no nothing. I was so pissed. I assured my boyfriend and our guests that she wouldn't return until one of our cups were empty or all of them, and I was right. We got our ticket, left no tip and thats exactly what she deserved. I never leave bad tips, but wow service was an embarassment.  Such a nice place to go if you want to just look around and enjoy the decor, go straight to the bar yourself or else you'll be getting crappy service. Park on Fremont, really need to reconsider the type of people their hiring. Yeah they're pretty and attract a bunch of drunk, high paying customers. But if you can't deliver decent service, then whats the point??? ALL IN ALL, I'd rather pay 10-20 to get into commonwealth or any other bar downtown than to go back to park on fremont. What a shame, so much potential.",

But wow does it smell like sewage:(( that's the only thing about it. We got lucky both times that we didn't smell any when we were eating, but it would come in waves... Wonder if they can do anything about it because their back patio is the spot to hang! Love the cool, creepy bathroom and controversial decor :)",

We were the 2nd so we got a seat at the bar pretty much as soon as we walked in and conveniently  near the Happy Hour specials sign. However, he failed to serve us in an appropriate time frame. Since he was busy ignoring us we figured we'd ask about the specials and decide what we wanted while we waited for him. We asked the bartender what beers were on special he said they all were. We asked twice, even. They, as well as some of the other bars had a special that included a beer and a shot for $6.00(I believe it was $6.00) Well neither of us are shot people so we just ordered the beer, he said $18.00. I said oh we only get the special if we order a shot? He took a beer away and gave us a bottle of beer and said $20! WTF!! Umm that still doesn't solve the problem. I spoke up and said you said all the beers were on special. He mumbled something but basically used the excuse that they were busy as to why he screwed up our service. I should have told him to shove it and go somewhere else but I didn't, I took the beer and the crappy shot and went on our way. Doubtful that I'll be returning. Poor service, as a bartender you have the power!! Give me the beers you screwed up at the special price listed, you get a bigger tip. You screwed it up after all. The worst part is that he could have cared two craps less that he didn't pay attention, didn't listen and that he screwed it up. Blah!",

Back patio area is very cool, you almost feel like you're not in downtown Las Vegas, which is something anyone can appreciate. The drinks are great as well. Try the Unicorn, kind of tastes like a mikes hard. Guys it sounds sissy but trust me, 2 or 3 of those and you'll get there. They use Ketel one for it, which happens to be my favorite vodka. Haven't tried the food yet, but that's a nice thing to offer considering the other bars don't have food.",

    "text": "Stopped by for a quick dinner before another event downtown. Walked in at 5:40 pm and the podium up front said, \"Seat Yourself Please\". There were 4 of us including one teenager. After we sat on the outside patio, a young waitress came to us and seemed appalled. \"Did the hostess seat you?\"  \"No, we seated ourself per the sign\". She continued that they don't allow children after 6 pm (20 minutes from our entry time) even though we never saw any posting of the sort or could even figure out why they wouldn't let kids in to eat there, even after 6. We ordered after we convinced the waitress that we would be quick because of a later commitment. Dinner was, fine, nothing special. Fresh but didn't blow me away. At about 6:15 as the waitress brought the check, she tells me, \"I spoke to the manager, and it's ok.\"  OK? Ok for what? We were done. Was she angling for a bigger tip because she \"allowed\" us to skirt this ridiculous, non posted, possibly made up policy? There are a lot of cool little places popping up downtown. Based on other reviews I've read here on Yelp for Park On Fremont, I think that some customer service techniques should be shared with the staff, if anyone there has the skills or cares to share them. I would not recommend this place to anyone I know or any customer that I may have in my limousine when asked for places to eat downtown. I think you have a cool place, I hope you care enough to address the issues you obviously have there.",

Second, my soup and bread bowl came out colder than room temperature and I had to send it back, which I hate doing being a server myself. Third, we told our server, skinny girl with long black hair and purple on top that our parking meter was about to run out so we needed our check. She walked past us again a few minutes later with no check, said nothing, and then another couple of minutes later we see her seating a party of twenty and taking all of their drink orders! Get out of here!! I had to leave the table and go pull the car out while my boyfriend waited for our check another 10 minutes. UNREAL! We still left almost 20%, but I hope she realizes she missed out on the usual 30-40% we normally leave both being servers ourselves. Lastly, a little too pricy for what you get. Don't think we'll be back.",

It's dimly lit and wall-to-wall with kitschy paintings & taxidermy. Their menus reflect their style too, with above-average bar food & cocktails called things like \"Garbage\" and \"the Unicorn.\"  It was unbearably hot outside, so everyone was seated right inside, by the bar. Service was quick & friendly and our orders came out fast as well. The food, however, was pretty underwhelming for the prices they were charging. Someone had recommended the \"Garbage\" fries to me, so I ordered them... and meh, NOT what I expected for $13. Mind you, an actual entree sandwich cost just a dollar more...  Other than that, it was a good experience. I wouldn't mind coming back for their Happy Hour sometime.",

Yes, it does have interesting decor, but that's it.  Other than that, there is nothing memorable or special about this bar.  Not to mention, you get the feeling the staff has kind of bought in to their own hype.  They have some kooky drink concoctions and dishes, but so does just about every other niche bar in Las Vegas.  Don't get me wrong, its not a \"bad\" experience. Not at all. Its just that its reviews and reputation are over-blown I think.  REVISED REVIEW: Based on another review I read in which a customer was mistreated because of their opinions or comments regarding LBGT community, I down graded from 2 Stars to 1 Star.  Take notice Park on Fremont. It is NOT one of yours or your other customer RIGHTs to NOT be offended. You are a BAR. Nothing more, Nothing less. You are going to get all kinds of people with all kinds of opinions. Democrats/Republicans. Liberals/Conservatives.  Its not your job to moderate these people or their comments/conversations. Your job is to shut up and serve drinks and food.  Concentrate on that.",

Then we got the garbage fries, the tater tots and the Avo Philly sandwich. I could've done without the Avo sandwich. It was like eating a cross between a tuna sandwich with a new York bagel. If you're in town, check this place out for sure. If not for the seesaw, definitely for the environment and especially for the bomb food. Waitresses were very accommodating as well.",

I love the outdoor patio (\"The Backyard\"), the service was fantastic, and the bar food was delicious. Memorable moments: Mac & Cheese Balls, Chicken Bar Bites, and The Unicorn (cocktail).   Last night, a couple of us stopped by after an event for a quick snack and drinks. I really could've done a meal, but Park on Fremont is really more of a drinking spot with bar food to nibble while hanging out. NBD. I can always eat fries and fortunately, they serve up some delicious fries here. Garbage Fries ($8) are made with their housemade fries, melted cheddar and provolone cheeses, bacon, fresh jalapeno, green onion, tomato, chipotle pepper, avocado, and a fried egg. It's so bad, but it's so good. I would absolutely order this again! I would love to try their housemade fries plain as well - not on the menu, but I'm sure they'd serve it.  We had fabulous service once again. He was very cool and checked on us appropriately. Also, he split our checks (there were three of us) without us having to ask! What a brilliant man!  You definitely want to hang out in The Backyard when you're here, especially now as the weather is cool at night. Don't forget to visit the seesaw in the back!",

When I came back for brunch today the menu has changed and apparently a chef has \"re-vamped\" the menu but unfortunately it was not for the better. My waitress was nice but the food took about 1 hour to come out. My friend ordered steak and eggs. The steak was undercooked and they don't even have steak knives!! She had to struggle to cut undercooked steak with a butter knife. The prices have increased as well and I am so disappointed. The park was our favorite spot now I don't think I will be visiting again. The manager Lauren was nice and aware of our concerns. She was very helpful.",

In the back there's a patio and a see saw! See saws and slightly buzzed people sound like a great idea right?  Now on to the food, it's just ok nothing that's phenomenal. The Mac and cheese balls are amazing and so is the fried chicken and waffle sandwich. Also the ketchup has a unique taste, in a good way though. The rest of the food is just sorta meh. But I don't come here for the food. I come for the drinks and atmosphere. They make a mean mojito and my friends rave about the unicorn and the wombat on bath salt. If you're down on Freemont and want to check out a bar that has great drinks and is at a great location try here!",

There is a big tree in the center and a see-saw hiding in the very back of the patio.   I have never had an issue getting great service here- someone is always checking up on you and making sure that everything is going fine and dandy in your bubble of existence.   I have come here several times on different occasions. The environment is appropriate for whatever (minus the small people). It makes perfect to go with one or more humans just for drinks or even just for eating.  I came here on a few dates (one which was on a date with myself) and it has always been a perfect place for me to enjoy the company I brought with me for some cocktails or even just for a couple of appetizers......but I'm not gonna lie- it's hard not grab even ONE of their delicious liquid beverages.  #Gf #foodies #downtown  I hope you aren't Vegan because the chipotle bbq wings are AMAZE! The salad is also delicious. Unfortunately there aren't that many options for GF people food-wise UNLESS you make this your go to place for getting cocktails. This is NOT your average place for such things...If you like #moscowmules you're gonna wanna try several of their mule options.  I just read about the brunch mamosa thingy and now I have another reason to visit even sooner.  Until next time, Park.......",

This is a great atmosphere, especially when the temps are good to hang out outside. The courtyard like area outside is a perfect spot to go for a chill night out. Also, if you venture a little further outside to the back of the seating area, there's a doorway off the side that leads to a small area with a seesaw. The inside is nice too, but it's definitely a hipster vibe with crazy wallpaper prints and animal heads on the walls.   The drink prices are pretty comparable to other places downtown, so expect to spend about $7/beer or $8/cocktail. They do have a \"beer and a shot\" deal which recently went up from $10 to $12, but still it's a pretty decent deal. They do have some good beers offered for this deal like Dog Fish Head 90 IPA, and it's not just well alcohol.   I've only been here at night, so I kind of want to see what it's like here during the day because it seems like a nice place to grab a bite of food or drink in the afternoon.",

I'll come back again for sure!  Looking over the menu, I want to try the Mac and Cheese ball and garbage fries for appetizers (happy hour is at 11pm-close).

The outdoor patio is perfect for people watching and there's plenty of interesting entertainment walking about while you sip your mimosa. Typically I seek places that offer bottomless mimosa options, but the $20 champagne bottle and OJ combo left us enough room to really enjoy the food. Do yourself a favor and get the garbage fries... I could have made that a meal by itself. I ordered the monte cristo served between French toast with a side of maple syrup, and my friend had the breakfast burrito. We ended up trading half of each. The monte cristo was a little disappointing and could have used some sort of fruit or compote on the side (I'm not a huge maple syrup fan anyways) but overall I was very happy with the experience. Plus the staff was all so nice, I don't remember our servers name but she was great too!",

They have prime real estate on the corner of Fremont overlooking the street, so I assumed the food would be top notch as well.  Don't get me wrong, the food was fine.  We had a make-your-own burger and kale salad.  Both were as good as you'll get anywhere around town.  But the problem with the location is the $3-4 upcharge on all meals when the meal is worth as much as a non-Fremont meal.  The beer also stood at around $1-2 too expensive.  All in all a nice spot to eat if you want to people watch, but there are better restaurants within a few blocks that I would recommend over Park for the same price with a more intimate and secluded atmosphere.",

    "text": "I came here with my bf one late evening just for the purpose to buy food. We were really hungry and decided to drop by here to order to-go to bring back to our hotel. The place is on Fremont street slightly away from the madness. The decor of the place is very rustic and charming, and definitely has a welcoming environment to it.  Workers seem to look more on the hipster side but the service was great! Right upon sitting in a booth, a waiter immediately came up to us asking if we needed help. After ordering to-go, the waiter even gave us waters while we waited for our food to come out which I thought was very considerate.   The menu is very simple, but I think that helps them focus on the quality of their food. We went ahead and settled for Buffalo wings and sweet potato tater tots, and both were delicious!! The buffalo wings were very crispy even though it was packed in a sealed container. The sweet potato fries kind of reminded me of waffles because they blended this syrup into it which made it unique from your average sweet potato fries! It has immediately become a favorite of mine!   If you're looking for some reasonably priced food and a great place to grab drinks with friends, Park On Fremont might just be the go to spot.  I would definitely next time try this place with friends for a casual night out.",

I appreciated the attention to detail with the bread selection and quality of pastrami chosen for my meal. The restaurant's decor will stick in my mind the longest; a Neo-Renaissance portrait of a young girl wearing a meat dress (Lady GaGa as a child?); an wall-mounted antelope trophy with golden-machine gun antlers; a pheasant couple mating under glass; a portrait of a brown bear holding a raccoon while being sexually assaulted by an octopus...I only WISH I could make this up!

    "text": "My friends and I wanted brunch after a Vegas trip, and came to Park on Fremont at the advice of a local. The bar and restaurant has a short menu with well crafted, thoughtful food and drinks, and a full bar. The decor is quirky and well curated, giving sense to what their drinks and food will be like. My friend and I shared the breakfast burrito and french toast and they were both phenomenal, and the other 4 people in our party were pleased as well. Park on Fremont reminds me of some spots in Oakland, where casual dining and drinks are more than just 4 walls and menu, but an experience and place with an identity. Service was friendly and efficient, and this is now on my list of places to come to anytime I pass through LV.",

I'm a sucker for ambiance and this place had it. It has a rustic vibe, with unique animal paintings surrounding you. They also leave trivia cards on the table! It was an overall great experience and I'd definitely come again!",

Since I am 24 days away from being of legal age to drink , my friends and I couldn't be sited to their back patio (which is mostly the reason why I wanted to try this place). We had a table at the front patio instead which I think is good too.  The atmosphere was really good. Exactly as the reviews that I read here on Yelp. Very hipster. The front patio has an outstanding view of the Fremont experience, totally worth of all the pictures.  I love their happy hour. The most popular sides were half off!    We ordered their garbage fries and I loved it! Definitely need to try. We also ordered some buffalo wings and mac and cheese balls.

Our waitress was so rude I didn't even want to tip her; the place was very slow so we expected a little more service. I didn't realize at the time, they had just opened but that still doesn't explain the fact that the waitress was so bad-mannered.

    "text": "I'm willing to give this place a second chance.  There is a lot of potential with this snazzy, rustic bar/resto.  The reason I am giving Park on Fremont three stars is because of the service and SUPER LOUD MUSIC in the garden.    8:30pm Friday night - When we got to the restaurant, I told the hostess we needed a table for two.  She started guiding us to a table outside facing Fremont Street, so I asked her if there was a table available in the back garden.  She told us that if we wanted to take a seat in the front, she would come get us once a table was ready in the garden.    Twenty minutes went by, and the hostess (girl with long/straight/two toned hair), was nowhere to be found.  Seems as though she went on break and forgot about us.  After my guest and I were done with our first round of drinks, I decided to go up to the new hostess to ask if a table was available for us in the back.  The new hostess apologized that her coworker had forgotten about us, and then walked us into the back garden, where there were several open seats - why we weren't given a seat in the garden initially is a mystery to me.    The garden was exactly what I imagined it to be.  I wouldn't recommend taking older folks here, since the music is LOUD and some of the chairs are slightly uncomfortable.    I wish they had more apps on the menu.  It would be nice to order a few sides, rather than a large meal.  They have fries, etc, but nothing healthy.  I ended up ordering the veggie sliders - which were delicious.  The buns were stale, but the veggie patty itself, was delicious!  My guest had the corn flake crusted chicken and he LOVED IT!  Throughout the meal, our waitress was missing, a lot.  Our drinks were empty most of the time, and I even noticed the table next to us making loud slurping noises from their glasses (probably hoping to get the attention of a waiter).  The outside bar had a group of employees hanging around talking most of the time, so the issue wasn't understaffing.    I hope management reads these reviews, because I really want to like this place.  I am hoping it was just a bad night.  I'll be back soon to try it again, but if the service is still sloppy and careless, I won't be back.  I used to be a concierge at a major strip property, and I wouldn't feel comfortable recommending this place yet to anyone (until they work our these small, but large, kinks).  I hope I can come back here at a later time and update my review with more stars - like I said, I really want to like this place.    I LOVE Commonwealth, and know it's owned by the same creators, but I don't feel like it's exactly up to par with it yet.",

No biggie, so we switch our orders, Sierra Nevada $5? for a can, bottle of Orange Blossom $7?, and a Heineken tall can $7?, REALLY? Is this a club, look around nope. So only one beer for us for the evening, no fun tonight.   Then we get seated, and order our food. 2 Philly Mac & Cheese Sandwichs, and the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich. 1st the Philly,  size good and that was about it, meat was bland, mac and cheese had no cheese, tasted like bread crumbs, the bread was too hard and dry. Would not order again. 2nd the Waffle sandwich, very small, not worth the price. Then the chicken was like rubber, so we sent it back and didn't request a replacement. On a side not the tater tots were good, but not enough.  Then time for the check, they had the audacity to try and charge for Waffle Sandwich, when we sent it back.   We will never come here again.",

Friday and Saturday nights are definitely their busiest, as to be expected, but the hostess we met (Nita) was very helpful in getting us seated fairly quickly for how busy it was!  We have run into her before in our weekly adventures downtown.  It's awesome to see that this business employs people who make sure to put their customers first!  I have yet to try the food here, but they do have a good $10 beer and a shot special.  And this special doesn't have to involve a well shot.  When they have it, I usually get a Dogfish Head 120 Minute IPA (usually around $14 a bottle in most bars) with a Jameson shot.  Definitely a good value!  As far as their other drinks go, their Bloody Mary drink (made with tequila) is great! Definitely recommend it if you're up to trying something a little different.  This place is more than worth a try if you haven't stopped by already!",

They were out of all the beer I wanted to drink so I was forced to have a cocktail called a trophy wife, which I didn't want in the first place.  Seems they were out of a lot of different beers the night we came. I wasn't the only one in our party who had to choose a plan b.  The food menu was really small. I ordered the veggie sliders and they were dry, bland and cold (?) yeah, I don't know why.  Carina (our waitress) had the nerve to write her name down for me and tell me to write a review about HER on yelp. Well here ya go honey!  I work in the hospitality industry.  I would never, ever, make a patron feel like I was giving them great service so they could write a review about me on yelp. She should be giving the great service because its her job, and to top it off, her service was bad! She was slow and I found myself looking for her most of the time.  She was also forgetful and didn't seem to know much about anything, as she was hesitant to answer any questions.  I think there is a lack of communication here or a lack of training.  In this case, maybe both.  My friends and I are very polite people.  I would never be a jerk to anyone at a restaurant.  We didn't say anything while we were there, but this review tells the all out truth.  I will not return, and neither will my friends.",

The music is (usually) cool, and the vibe can't be beat - it's one of few places on Fremont East that doesn't try way too hard, and it's definitely not trying to be an obnoxious club like its brother, Commonwealth.

It wasn't overly crowded but busy enough to get the feeling that Park on Fremont is the place to be. Ambiance is all types of adorable.  Quite eclectic, actually. Inside, there are booths and tables and a good size bar area.  There are rustic chandeliers hanging in the hallway that leads to the outside patio. Cool pictures and paintings hang from the wall as well as antique plates and saucers.   My favorite part of Park on Fremont is their outside patio area. They have good picnic table seating for the size of the patio. There are cute lights all over the place - on the walls, in the tree. Awesome sign that says \"F*cking Beautiful\" (I think everyone should take a picture in front of this green neon sign!). When the weather is perfect and you're around fun people, the patio is where it's happening!  I had one of their refreshing cocktails, the \"Pillow Talk\". This is so yummy! Cucumbers, strawberries, orange, mint and lemon mixed with soda and some alcohol/liquor (I forget, I'm sorry!) makes this drink in a mason jar perfect for a summer night! I saw that other people were ordering shots and those come in mini mason jars as well. Love!   My two gal pals and I ordered a small chocolate cheesecake dessert that came in a shot glass. This stuff is super rich, super sweet, super delish. Don't let the size fool  you - bigger is not always better.   From what I hear, their food is so-so. But the ambiance and the drinks are so awesome that food or no food, I'll be coming back in the near future.",

Treat yourself to a game of I spy with the people at your table to see who can find the most interesting pice of art on the walls haha. That evening our server was Erica, and she took excellent care of us. I got the veggie wrap with sweet potato tots, and OMG, you gotta get these tots! Perfect mix of sweet and salty as a side!  The wrap was really tasty as well, but I love these tots!  Everyone was very pleased with their meal and drink selection, and prices were really reasonable.

    "text": "Park on Fremont is legit.   1. Ambience  Located almost on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Fremont, with a large outdoor patio with tables and a few bar stools. There is an outdoor park area (with a hidden see-saw), that lights up at night. The place is filled with unique art and is very kitschy-hipster chic (a deer head with machine gun antlers). It has a very modern, artsy feel.   2. Alcohol/Drink Booze isn't my forte. I'm not much of a drinker, but they have a ton of microbrews and specialty handcrafted beers (Banana Bread Beer), a lot of which are on tap.They also have microbrew sodas available as well. They have a slew of Bloody Marys with several kitchy names as well as signature cocktails.  3. Food My sister and I got to enjoy dinner on the beautiful patio. Some of the chairs outdoors aren't that comfortable. I ordered the Chicken and Waffle sandwich with sweet potato tots and my sister had the Mac N Cheese Philly with friends. My sandwich, (chickwaff) was pretty good. Double stacked chicken, bacon, and the bread was a Belgian waffle. I couldn't get the whole things in my mouth (that's what she said - Zing!). The sandwich was a bit dry, but our attentive server was happy to bring me extra syrup. The tots were amazing and were served with this homemade honey mustard sauce. OMG. SO GOOD! My sisters sandwich was a gift from the hipster gods. Sweet crimony, I cannot believe she let me sample it (for Yelp Review purposes)! First, this sammie should come with a bib, it's messy, my sister handled it like a pro. The combination of mac N cheese, tender philly steak, peppers, and that cheese sauce! OMG-amazing! The fries were natural cut and served with a spicy homemade ketchup. Another homerun.  Park on Fremont is a solid and welcomed addition to my beloved Fremont East. Great, fun inventive food, inspired libations, comfortable clean, hipster atmosphere. What's not to love. If your looking for a place to park your feet and enjoy some tasty eats, look no further! Cheers, Park!",

    "text": "This review is based off of my second visit. Okay the first time I went to this place it was during happy hour and it was bomb dot com!! The service,  the drinks, the food......everything was on point!  I raved about it so much that I took a friend, hoping that they would experience the same awesomeness that I had.  Sadly however,  our experience was anything but awesome! While the food and drinks were still good,  the horrible service left a bad taste in our mouths. It kind of came off like the servers had NO IDEA that there were people who wanted to be served. It took them 10-15 minutes to even come over to us and offer us water, then after that  another 10-15 minutes to take our order, food comes out and then I have wait 20 minutes after the food was served for the beer I ordered when they first offered us water. I have no idea what's going on, but poor service really sucks! I'm usually a good tipper, but I'm sorry I can't reward poor service. I hope they get it together, cause I really like their happy hour, garbage fries, and buffalo chicken bites.",

SERVICE #1 Star--The blonde waitress cute, but cute does not equal good service.  In fact it was awful service.  She took our drink order (one beer, one red wine..she said Cab was all they had..I said OK) she brought out the beer for my guy, he asked for a glass.. we waited and waited and finally he got up and found one himself somewhere at bar area...GEEZ.  Oh, did I mention, I never got my wine, but was given a glass of water. I ordered the burger with fried egg and a side salad. FOOD #4 Stars-- YUMMY is all I can say about this burger.  Absolute perfection.  The side salad was fresh and tasty. Yes, I will go back and give it another try.  Hopefully the next time will be with a different waitress.",

Food was good but considering how tiny the sections are and that we had zero service from our waitress and that the runners behavior was terrible. Also we asked for a manager, they said she was too busy to talk to us, the hostess even said that. This place is an embarrassment, I could serve circles around the idiots there.",

The place looked kinda small, but we sat on the patio and the people watching and drinks were both good.    The garbage fries are amazing. Get them. You'll regret it if you don't. Go there just to try them even.   We ordered the Mac & cheese Philly cheesesteak and the chicken & waffle sandwich. They were fine. We shared and still couldn't finish them.

This place is just super chill and super pretty (make sure you go to the patio the vibes are everlasting) and the food and drinks are very reasonably priced. The fish tacos were amazing, and the service was decent. But the most important thing about Park is :  THE SECRET SEE-SAW IN THE BACK !  It's not advertised at all, but if you go out to the patio there is a super skinny doorway in the back wall that leads to the life sized see-saw. The thing is huge. I'm pretty sure it isn't advertised because then everyone will want to get on, but luckily for us we had it all to ourselves for a cool fifteen minutes. So fun.   Old Vegas can hang !",

I noticed other people had pineapple, I wasn't so lucky I guess? Service was ok. We were still hungry so we ordered breakfast potatoes/homefries. I guess the server was confused but also didn't ask for clarification so we were brought French fries. We figured, we would just suck it up and eat them even for breakfast . My inner 8 year old screaming \"yay! Fries for breakfast!!!\" Lol The manager? Awesome! Very pleasant and fixed us up right away with what we were looking for. She kinda saved the whole dinning experience from what started out to be kind of a mess. Hang on to her!  All in all, the competition out there is fierce, I'll probably skip this place next time I'm in town for something a little less of a hassle.

Ended up here on the default it was a beautiful evening to be outside, and most bars nearby don't serve food.   We sat in the front picket fence patio which is good if you want to people watch the coming and goings of Fremont.   With drinks you can get a sampler of 4 mix and match drinks (signature cocktails or draft beers) for $20 which is not bad for a anytime of the day deal. Out of the drinks we tried the Wombat on Bathsalts was the better of them. One of my drinks, Pillow Talk, basically tasted like soda water.   I ordered fried pickle to munch on. This was actually pretty good and I liked the banana peppers were also battered and fried. It had decent seasoning and went well with the ranch. The portion though was measly though. I let a few people take a pickle and I had 3 bites.   The BF got a burger and it was not medium as requested but well done, no pink at all. It was also very dry and it didnt help that it needed a sauce. The sweet potato tots were not crispy enough, it barely had any crunch on the outside.   My brother in laws food was greasy and the garbage fries were really salty.  Service was okay. She was busy doing a full patio herself so times she wasn't around to flag I saw her running around for other tables so I can't blame her for it.   It's a A-OK place. I wish we got a table in the back garden so it would be nice garden ambiance, but the front porch wasn't a bad spot. The tall stools weren't so comfy to sit on though so try to sit on the tables and not the back tall table if possible.   Drinks and food could have better consistency standards. This place could be amazing as the spot and ambiance is right, but it falls short in serving quality.",

Overall it is a very fun, affordable restaurant located right in the middle of downtown Las Vegas. They do offer endless mimosas which is always a necessity for my brunch sessions. Servers are friendly and if the weather allows for it, I love to sit into their \"backyard\" patio. They even feature a cool seesaw behind the brick wall. I have tried several different brunch options on their menu. My favorite so far has been the french toast and chilaquiles, I will usually order both tbh lol   Overall if your looking for a decent brunch, that's not to expensive in a fun atmosphere, then I highly recommend!",

The menu very simple. Nice portions. Lots of drink choices.  Great bloody Mary's! Ordered spicy which I think only called for fresh ground pepper which I prefer over hot sauces. French toast good but I didn't care much for the citrus flavor whipped cream I tried on my friend's plate.   That's my opinion.  Avocado toast was ok but the onions were way overpowering the avocado.  It tastes like onions and toast. Unfortunately this order didn't arrive until I had to ask for it and my friends were nearly done eating.  They did not charge me for the toast but added an additional bloody Mary to the bill and we had to have it removed.   We didn't get good service at all.  Only 3 napkins were delivered to the table for 6 people. We were told they were short staffed. It didn't feel like a short staff situation.. just server errors. I hope management steps it up in the future.",

They're definitely is enough room for a nice-size party. Park on Fremont was suggested to me by a co-worker so I decided to try it out Saturday for brunch however I left sorely disappointed. I ended up ordering a chicken and waffle sandwich which to me really tasted very Bland.  Honestly when it came out it really look like a piece of chicken in between Eggo waffles nothing spectacular that you can't make it home. The only reason why I'm giving this place a 2-star is because the wait staff was really friendly and very prompt and they had good drinks.",

    "text": "As an update to my 1 star review, \"Paul S.\" privately messaged me in response the same day, which I post the screenshot for your reading pleasure. I have to say, if this is an apology, it's the most spiteful one I've ever received. And if your job title for this establishment is \"Customer Service\" you may want to revisit the definition since you were generous enough to provide me the definition of RESERVATIONS in your response, which I will happily address hereto.   Let's start with your alleged video and audio feed from the front patio. Your camera equipment must be some high tech stuff for sure. Does it project scenarios from your hostess's mind wherein she thought to say the word \"reservations\" out loud in order to deter me and my party from being seated? Or perhaps you were viewing a completely different video from a different day where a woman with the same number of people in her party, including 3 minors, had an impatient attitude after being told she would have to wait 15 minutes due to patrons with patio reservations? Either way, your review of the alleged video and audio of what happened is pure fiction.  No, I was not told it would be a 15 minute wait and that our party could be accommodated after customers with patio reservations were seated. No, your hostess never once uttered the word \"reservations\" at any point during our exchange. No, your hostess didn't ask anyone standing in that line waiting to get seated if they had \"reservations.\" No, I did not react as you suggested, and I quote: \"...an attitude and impatience on your part because you were not immediately accommodated.\" No, that did not happen, not even a little. I'm sure that sort of scenario has happened in the past and I'm sure it's going to happen in the future. But that did not happen on that day with me and my party of 9, who were patiently waiting for the restaurant to open and to be seated. I have 8 witnesses who can back me up on that versus your so-called front patio video and audio feed.   Your hostess, by proxy of your manager, who I never spoke to, simply came back to me and stated: \"We cannot seat you.\" Period. End of story. No further words, explanations, consolations, suggestions and/or insinuations using the word that you so aptly and condescendingly defined for me: RESERVATIONS. I don't blame this hostess for her dismissive attitude because apparently it's written in her job description and practiced as a matter of the culture within, rolling down from the top. I maintain that this place has a demographic it would prefer to cater to and that's fine. I missed the red velvet rope while standing in line waiting for the business to open so that we could be seated.        I'm a native of this town and I've seen a lot of restaurants like this one come and go. I've worked in the restaurant business, I understand the concept of customer service and a place is only as good as its management's treatment of all of its customers, would-be and regulars. I wasn't asking for anything outrageous or being difficult to your staff. I asked for a couple of tables for us to sit and eat. Had you bothered to actually read my review, I am the one who suggested that my party of 9 could be split up, ultimately being a customer accommodating both a hostess and a manager who could not be bothered so early in the day. Your sardonic tone complete with False accusations of a non-existent scenario in response to my review, messaged to me rather than posted, shows an utter lack of concern or professionalism on your part. You would have done well enough to just not respond to me at all, \"Paul S.\"",

My sister had the lettuce wraps and she said she loved them. Great little spot to get a really good quick bite to eat. They have great drinks too... my sister ordered the unicorn.

Most people there seemed like tourists day-drinking (must be nice!!), and some like us were there for lunch grub.  Their food menu is quite limited but very well selected. There's something for everyone.  We ordered Samurai Tots for appetizer, ham and Swiss Monte Cristo for my main, my husband ordered chicken and waffle sandwich.  Let me tell you about this Samurai Tots! First of all, they give you a lot of tots! Good enough for 4 people, I'd say. For two of us, honestly, we could've just ordered this and we'd still be full.  I don't remember the description of this dish, but basically, it's Takoyaki, but tots instead of puff balls. Garnished with green onion, Sriracha mayo (could've been aoli, don't remember) and okonomiyaki sauce, fish flakes....I have to admit, I ate way too much. They're damn good!!  I'm a fan of sweet and savory, so Ham and Swiss Monte Cristo hit the spot for sure.  My husband liked his chickenand waffle sandwich. It had bacon in it, waffle was semi crispy outside, soft inside. And that perfectly for crispy chicken.  Overall, this place serves great food, especially for a bar. I foresee myself coming back here for lunch in the near future, or for night-outs with friends.",

I love the eclectic decor. It has dark Alice in Wonderland vibes! The patio is is gorgeous, but a little too chilly to eat out there in December. To our pleasant surprise they just rolled out a new menu! My family tried a little bit of everything. We ordered the grilled cheese with tomato bisque, nachos, beef satay, garbage fries, Mac and cheese balls and the peppercorn avocado burger. EVERYTHING was so good. Even the little salad that came with the beef satay was so yummy.  We loved their unique Bloody Mary menu as well. I tried one with a cucumber basil mix, but I can't remember the name. On top of the great menu, we had amazing service. The manager came by a few times to see how we liked the new food items and our server was attentive. It was all around a great experience. It's such a unique restaurant. I wish we had something like it in Sacramento. I will always recommend Park on Fremont to my friends visiting Vegas and will definitely be back myself.  Oh, and did I mention there's a hidden teeter totter in the back courtyard? So fun!",

The atmosphere was great the food was great but the service however was horrible. My friend was looking for a list of whiskeys  which the waitress said they had and she would bring over. 10 minutes later my friend had not received the list. She had to go find the waitress to ask for it so she could order a drink. We ordered drinks and food but needed water. We asked the waitress (who now was a different waitress because they switched mid shift) for water. She of course didn't remember and when she came back to see how the food was we asked for it again.  We had empty glasses that weren't cleared and the waitress didn't even ask if we wanted more drinks.  We asked our first waitress to split our check into 3 before we even ordered so that at the end there would be no issue. Of course that information wasn't relayed to the new waitress and she brought us 1 check. When we asked her to split it, her exact words were \"well I have no idea what each of you got\"  I live in Vegas and my friends and I go at least once a month to a restaurant for drinks and food. We were so excited for this restaurant but were extremely disappointed and will not be returning due to the bad service",

    "text": "If a restaurant as itself could be a piece of art, it would resemble Park on Fremont.   When you walk into this restaurant, you'll notice it has the cozy space of your local dive bar: a bar section along one side of a narrow interior and a row of tables along the opposite side. But seating isn't limited to this area - there's also plenty of space out front and out in the back [hidden in the back is a full sized see-saw (yes, see-saw)].   As I mentioned at the top, this place is a piece of art. It's like Tim Burton collaborated with an interior designer and suggested, \"less goth more abstract,\" \"mute the colors,\" and \"throw in some flair shit like TGIFridays does.\" And so they came up with ceilingpaper patterns, fireplace beer taps, record player jukebox, taxidermy birds... I could enjoy spending all day just looking at this stuff... and eating stuff!  The eats we had on this visit were small and perfect for a casual bite. We got in around 6pm and it turned out to be happy hour, so we took advantage. I had the Steak Tacos ($6, normally $9) which came with three tasty corn tortilla tacos with salsa, guac, and sour cream. Also ordered the Garbage ($6, normally $13) fries, which can be substituted with tots or chips. It was probably one of the best versions of a nachos-style dish: cheddar & provolone, bacon, green onions, tomato's, and jalapenos. Great dishes at a great price.   This was only the happy hour experience. I want to come back and try out the build a Burger or the Mac & Cheese Balls.",

    "text": "The food and drinks are always phenomenal here. The Fried pickles are always a must when I come in. This particular visit I tried the egg sandwich and added sausage patties. The sausage is more sweet than I was expecting and the bacon has very minimal flavor. Their tater tots are right up there with the fried pickles. I usually am turned off by ketchup, but theirs has some kick to it and I finished off the whole side with my sandwich and tots.  The reason for the three stars is due to the service. When my friend and I walked in, there were two tables sat inside. We sat in the back patio and there were about 4-5 tables sat before us that already had their food. Once my friend and I were sat we watched 3 additional parties being sat. Two of which were 2-tops and one a 4-top. I only noticed two servers manning the back patio. A server assistant brought out waters for the tables. One server greeted the last table sat. Another greeted the third then second table. My friend and I understand the craziness of the restaurant industry so we waited. After 10 minutes of waiting and ready to order I had to flag down the other server when we made eye contact.   I do want to note I really enjoy coming to this restaurant the vibe and location is great. I just want this review to be a positive feed back to help this establishment be the best it can be. I'm not sure if it was just a short staff kind of day or the kitchen was backed up. Either way, I'll be back!",

    "text": "The decor falls firmly in the zone of Tim Burton garage sale chic. It's actually a pretty amazing place to experience, and while the food and drinks are good, the context of the environment they've created here makes it all that much better.  Here you will eat cheesy, saucy, tasty comfort foods, sip inventive cocktails and soak up the creepy cool atmosphere. While this may all sound a bit too hipster, I think you'll find this place very accessible to everyone, with the clientele as diverse as the Las Vegas strip.  The eats are solid. Not groundbreaking, but certainly well made. My burger was well cooked and seasoned with a nice crisped brioche bun. I was here with a pretty large group and we tried the majority of the shareables. The real standouts were the blistered shishito peppers (unique, just slightly spicy and loaded with flavor) and the fried pickles. The pickles managed to pull off having a crunchy snap even through the crispy coating. Dynamite.  Definitely a place to check out and explore. You are paying for the atmosphere here, so while it feels a little overpriced, when taken in the context of the whole experience it feels worth it. The patio is definitely worth a look.",

Before we walked in, the ladies asked for ID and sat us outside, which was a bad idea. It was HOT AF today! We let it go for a little bit to see if we could somehow adap to the heat *sarcasm*, but eventually we kinda did. Our servers started us with our drinks and ordered the bottomless mimosas for $25/person! They were pretty strong and you will get buzzed.   Our server was so accomodating. She's very pretty, Asian, with long hair. I wish I got her name, but I loved her! She checked on us frequently. We asked if we could sit inside by chance, and she kept an eye out for us until one of her indoor tables left. It took a minute, but it happened after we finished eating our meals. So, we just finished our drinks inside.  I ordered the Fremont French Toast. It's very simple and not too sweet. It's perfect enough that you do not even need the syrup because of the strawberries on the top. The whipcream was so light and refreshing.  My friend ordered the chiliquiles, and IT WAS SO GOOD. She ordered for it to be a little bit spicer and it was the perfect amount of spicy. She said it was \"Americanized\", but we both agreeed that it was really good.   Can't wait to come back!",

When we went, mac & cheese was the seeming theme of the night, so we had the mac & cheese balls (delicious) as well as the mac & cheese cheese steak sandwich (also tasty). I liked their chicken bites with the cornflake breading, it came with a really tasty chipotle barbecue sauce for dipping. The sweet potato tots were intriguing, so we ordered them but the cinnamon they were dusted with was a bit too much.  Drinks list was well ordered and extensive. Tried a new beer, and finished the meal with a hot, sugary cocoa concoction. Overall, I'd come back, if for no other reason to scope the patio out back. This place has a lot to offer.",

Typically, after being greeted and seated by the host/ hostess we wait an average of 5-7 minutes for our drink order to be taken. They have a good variety of craft beer (our drink of choice) either on draft or bottled.  Our go to order is usually the chicken bar bites with their assorted dipping sauces and a side of the sweet potato tots (highly recommend the honey mustard sauce -- this from someone who doesn't really like honey mustard :)  as well as a Build Your Own Burger, or BYOB for short, with a side salad.   Our only complaints would be  1) after ordering a burger cooked to medium and receiving it well done can be disappointing and 2) the wait time to actually GET your drinks after ordering can be a little lengthy.  Overall good food, great atmosphere (though if you don't want to be bothered by the transients walking by, do not sit along the fence outside!!) and friendly people. Very highly recommended!!",

I went with the steak tacos and my friend went with a burger. I love that they give you such a full serving because I was so stuffed even after 2 tacos when it came with 3!  we had a couple cocktails which I wish I remembered the name of the one I ordered which was sweet and had cucumber in it. my friend had the whisky. cocktail which was great as well.   definitely stop by this place if you're downtown for great drinks and food :) or if it's late night and you need a quick pit stop!",

    "text": "If Urban Outfitters opened up a restaurant, Park on Fremont would be it. I really felt like I stepped into an Urban Outfitters catalog once I walked through the bar and onto the patio dining area with its strung outdoor patio lighting, mounted wall plates that were probably thrifted, and the various pairs of shoes that were hung from a wire to indicate that the street pharmacist is just around the corner.   FOOD Veggie Sliders with Sweet Potato Teeter Tots: The Veggie Sliders were bland.  No flavor whatsoever. There was a thin layer of what looked like mayonnaise, but its flavor wasn't detectable at all. The yellow, sweet sauce used for dipping the tots into didn't help. I even requested some mustard to slather onto the mini, meatless patties. Again, no flavor. I concocted a mixture consisting of both sweet sauce and mustard. Still, no flavor. These sliders need their own special sauce or more seasonings because these were beyond dull.   The Sweet Potato Teeter Tots tasted similar to churros. They were sweet and a little crunchy. Its accompanying sauce was unnecessary.   SERVICE Our waitress did a good job at checking up on us often. Though, she seemed to exhibit hesitance after I requested mustard for my sliders.   OTHER The patio is lovely, and I like the whole feeling of outdoor urban dining. BUT, I wouldn't suggest dining out there. The stench of sewage and garbage tainted the air and wafted into our direction. At one point, one of the employees lit a stick of incense which wasn't strong enough to mask the overpowering odors.  OVERALL This place is probably more suitable for grabbing drinks than a bite to eat, but I can't imagine ever making a return visit even just for a drink.",

We had an array of food items. We literally tried each and every item on the happy hour menu. We were fully satisfied with how delicious the food was! We even tried eggplant lettuce wraps which were $11 and not on HH. We're very lax with certain errors on food, for example... we asked for no jalapenos on our HH fries. Of course, the fries came out with a bunch of jalapenos. It was fine, we scooped em out. The second order was correct. The next issue was with my mule that lacked the bitters flavor that it advertised. I asked for some extra bitters to be added into my mule and it was no prob. What I am marking off for, is the selection and prices of drinks. They're a trendier bar/lounge/resto... if think or assume that they would offer at least a few of their cocktails to be priced for HH. But they weren't, boo hoo. Prices started at $9 a pop, but it didn't stop us girls from at least ordering 2 cocktails each. Overall... it was about $140-$150 with tip for 4 of us ladies on a Thursday.",

    "text": "Have been meaning to check it out on friend's recommendation and finally got around to it last night, woo-hoo!   Located in the center of downtown Las Vegas hustle and bustle and adjacent to a slew of other trendy bars and hangouts, it doesn't disappoint.    Decor is a typical hip and cool mix of damask print wallpaper, copper accented high tops, random prints of weird eyed creatures on wall- very eclectic, very well thought through and carefully selected, it works nicely all pulled together.    Don't know that Tuesday night warrants a bouncer outside carding the patrons- it's cute and all when you are 20-ish but when you are pushing 40, might as well hand over your Chevron card and we can skip the formalities, nobody's looking at your DOB at this point.    The crowd is a good mix of facial haired, eyeglass wearing downtown dwellers, tipsy girls in tight dresses, clearly running a melon smuggling operation, tourists exploring downtown and a few thirties-forties some locals like myself, keeping up with the times.    The menu is small and straightforward- like! While I did contemplate a fancy Bloody Mary, one of three described on menu, I decided to go for craft beer on tap. My one gripe is that nobody seems to get that Hef lovers don't want apricot, jalapeno or whatever flavor all the time and no, Blue Moon is not \"craft\", so I settled for an ok blond brew of some sort. Served in mason jar. Because. That's how cool people drink, don't question it.   Now for the food- uncomplicated selection of appetizers, hearty fare and slower metabolism selection, one pager, love it. Against my better judgement of knowing what's good for me, I order Garbage Fries. OMG. I think they are called Garbage Fries because you realize all other fries you've eaten up to now have been garbage. It's a delicious journey into crispy fries, hunks of savory bacon, fresh jalapeno, diced avocado, fried egg and cheesies. It's probably a 3,000 calorie offering, but I'm ok knocking it down to nothing but tomatoes and eggs for a week to justify these.    There was some talk of tacos and dos Equis specials for Tuesday night, but I'm very happy I didn't sway and stuck with the heavenly fries.    Check it out next time you stumble by on your way to El Cortez!",

    "text": "Hooray!!  Another new restaurant in DTLV.   Before I review this place, I need to apologize to the rest of our party for the service.  Yes, I admit that I was part of the reason why some of the people in our group didn't get 5 star service. Heck, I didn't even get 5 star service. But I did get what I thought was a very attentive server.  Carina was very nice, gave her recommendations on what I should eat & drink, and even chatted up a storm with me. One thing I've noticed about restaurants in Las Vegas, waitresses always like to chat and sometimes the conversations can get out control where service for everyone else suffers. While I got excellent service, the rest of our group didn't.  For that, I apologize to Terri R, Alicia R, Sugi, Toni R, and Merrick.  Won't happen again, I promise.   As for the actual food, I thought it was pretty good and different.  The  items on the menu reminded me of a fusion type Hash House without the huge portions.  Prices for the food are about average to what you find off the strip, but cheap considering you're in tourist land.  I had their Fried Chicken and Waffles with Sweet Potato Tater Tots.  I thought that this was flavorful with a bacon after taste. Their Sweet Potato Tater Tots was something different and thought it was pretty good. I washed my meal down with water, the Unicorn, and some old school Olde English 800.    Ambiance is a solid 4 stars, maybe a 5 during the weekdays.  We ate outside, which was great for people watching.  The only issue with eating outside is the smell coming out of the sewer.  My suggestion, try to eat inside if you can. It will be tighter, but at least you don't get that horrendous sewer stench.  For drinks, you can take advantage of their bar or backyard garden.  The drinks, or lack there of, was a problem.  Park on Fremont was not prepared for the amount of people for their first week that they ran out of a lot of drinks that were on their menu by 8 PM.  Hopefully, this gets fixed soon.   Overall, I give this place 4 stars even with all the hiccups. I'm giving Park on Fremont a break mainly because this is just the first week they have been open.   Food/Drinks: -Fried Chicken and Waffles (Cap N Crunch Fried Chicken with Applewood and Smoked Bacon Waffles):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=GdRGpzfkvB96qtLx9IuLag#yPmBv7KxicmeCtxN5F7P3Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park...</a>  -The Unicorn (Ketel One Citron Vodka, lemon juice, simple syrup-mint, ginger beer, and lemon wedge):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=Oyv1WrwBhCfkVTLXJmKV8Q#Cr5FTbdQDRnffQj1Sp-6Yg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park...</a>  -Olde English 800 (8-Ball):  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/park-on-fremont-las-vegas?select=GdRGpzfkvB96qtLx9IuLag#0cE0O4i3lXdqxCCeFhuyvw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/park...</a>  PS: Park on Fremont needs to change their business hours that are posted on Yelp.  The hours are obviously wrong at the moment.  And again, hopefully their beer stock improves.",

    "text": "East Fremont has a great bar for beer and food!  Park on Fremont is now open.  They call themselves a gastropub...and I get it.  They have a great selection of beer (pub) and they do an elevated bar food-meets-comfort food...so yeah, they're a gastropub...just not what I would typically think of when I think gastropub.  Everything on the menu is tweaked or twisted in some way to be more than just your run-of -the mill bar menu.  Park on Fremont is the bar I always wanted to aesthetically design, but never knew  about.  Owned by the same group as the nearby Commonwealth, Park on Fremont is just plain cool on the inside.  Look around...stuffed birds behind the bar, a deer head with gold plated machine guns in its antlers, throwback trendy wallpaper, a beer garden that is way too cool for school!  Suffice it to say that you need to come down and check it out.    There is not a lot of good food on East Fremont.  Park on Fremont is absolutely quality food!  I had the Philly Mac and Cheese Steak...yeah, a Philly Cheese steak with mac and cheese on top..I know why didn't you think of this before and make it?  Eat this.  I also tried the Chicken Bar Bites--Cornflake crusted pieces of real chicken with a trio of sauces...too large to be called nuggets...too small to be called fingers.  There were tasty.  I opted not to order the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich.  I heard it was a little on the small side, but it sounded so good. Cap'n Crunch fired chicken with applewood, smoked bacon waffles and vanilla maple syrup...I will be eating you in the future...promise!  ...I almost forgot!...Sweet Potato Teeter Tots!...soo good!   My only qualm...and maybe I'm just spit-balling here...all the beers come in mason jars...cool I know...but are they the normal 16oz pour you are expecting?...I'm not up to date on my mason jar volumes, but they felt more like 14oz and I thought I would be getting a standard American Pint.  Maybe I did, but without some actual measuring I'll never know.  Come here for good food while hopping the happening bars of East Fremont! Come here for a great beer selection! Come here for a beer garden that will make you swear you're not in Vegas! Come here for a different take on bar food! Come here for sippy, summer cocktails that will transport you poolside! Come here just to find the secret smoking area of the patio! Regardless of why...you should in fact come here!",

    "text": "Not your standard downtown Fremont (DTF) east bar!  This is a gastropub (bar and restaurant).  It sits on the northeast corner of Fremont and Las Vegas Blvd.  To me there are three different sections to Park on Fremont, the front patio, the inside, or the back patio.    The front patio is perfect for people watching.  Especially at night when you see all the craziness happen on Fremont street.  The inside has tables and bars, it's your standard restaurant setting.  Then you have the back patio which has a more intimate setting.  The back patio also has a secret pathway in the far back left corner which when you walk around the corner is a seesaw.  That's also a designated smoking area.  Which area would I recommend?  I like the back patio, that's where I've met some random and cool people.  The front patio is also nice but I haven't been able to mingle with people as much as I do in the back patio.  The bar or inside Park on Fremont is your standard restaurant setting.    I don't care much about the food.  If I was to eat here I'd get the reuben with tots.  But my coworkers after a long nights work love coming down here to have a beer or two.  I just go down the list and try something new every night I join them.  And the selections of different beers is what brings me here at least twice a week.  Park on Fremont you have turned me into a soggy man sandwich!",

    "text": "I had heard about Park on Fremont when a fellow Yelper started a thread on them on Yelp Talk. I looked them up on Facebook and I loved the photos they had on there and decided to follow them on Twitter. We came here last night (Saturday night) around 10PM and we were greeted by the tall bouncer who checked our ID's, and two hostesses. We had a choice to eat inside or outside and we chose inside. We were seated right at the very first table, across from the bar. I liked where we sat as the booth was very comfortable and I got a good view of the bar and they had some very interesting decor. The whole place had great decor. It was kinda dark and loud where we sat but I got used to it after a while.  We sat for a few minutes when Jose (I'm guessing a manager) came over and introduced himself to us and told us that our waitress would be over soon. In less than a minute, our waitress came over and she was so sweet. I didn't catch her name but she's a pretty, petite, blond wearing a thin headband. I ordered the Banana Beer and the Chicken Bar Bites, and my boyfriend wanted the grilled cheese but they were all out of that so he got the Chicken Bar Bites instead. For his beer, he ordered Red Stripe but the waitress came back and said that they were all out of it, and because of that, the manager would buy  him his beer. So the bf named at least 3 more beers that were on the menu but they were all out of the ones he named. Finally he asked the waitress which ones they had and were good and she recommended the Dogfish Head Raison D'etre beer.  I absolutely loved my banana bread beer, and my bf enjoyed his beer as well. The chicken bites came with fries and even though the chicken bites looked really plain and simple, it tasted really good. The chicken was juicy and the breading had a slight crunch to it. The fries were ok.  We will definitely return in the next few weeks as I really want to try their Philly Mac and Cheese Steak, and I'd like to check out their outside patio area.  I would have given them five stars but I deducted one star because they were out of many beers.",

However, the service wasn't great...we waited 10 minutes before someone even approached us and no apology was offered for waiting so long.  Food was OK--it came extremely fast and was cold, so I wonder how much of it was prepared previously and just warmed up as needed.  Bloody Marys were good and the bottle of champs for mimosas at 25 bucks was a pretty good deal too.",

We're usually in DTLV on Wednesdays anyways so, decided to check it out before hitting up Commonwealth.  Even before going to Park, I had been seeing pictures of this place on Instagram and was really excited to go.  We entered into what seemed like a chill lounge area fronted by a patio with white picket fences... CUTE, right.  My BF knew the hostess; and she originally seated us in a booth in the lounge but, said she freed up a table in back for us.  We walked into what seemed like \"secret (not really) garden\" setting in that the decor seemed so whimsical and romantic. There was a tree decorated with lights in the middle of the patio surrounded by a flower garden; and our table was right next to it. It was so pretty. My boyfriend and I talk about how it would be a great setting for a 1st date as there's alot of people watching and the decor itself just gave alot to talk about.  My boyfriend ordered his favorite beer, Banana Bread Beer, which obviously tastes like what it sounds. I ordered \"The Unicorn\" cocktail just because there was ginger beer in it. And we decided to share the chicken and waffles sandwich with sweet potato tater tots.  As we waited for our food, we noticed more things about the decor. Like there was an iron carriage on one of their rooftops; there were baby Jordans (Nike shoes for all the un-sneakerheads) hanging from a wire that runs across the patio; AND there was a see-saw (teeter-totter) in their designated smoking section.  Told you --- WHIMSICAL =) I loved it.  Also, always love wallpaper and THEY gots it. Almost like Cosmopolitan Hotel's funky wallpapers!  My boyfriend got his beer; and we got the chicken and waffles sammie. The chicken was savory with all the maple on it and really thin like a chicken katsu; I liked it very much. The waffles, on the otherhand, not-so-much. It was soft =(  I'm sure my eggo waffles at home would have been better! Thankfully, the sweet potato tots more than made up for the shoddy waffles.   Sadly, I never got my \"Unicorn\" cocktail til almost the end of dinner. Waitress said the bar was backed up.  New restaurant; I know they're still figuring out the kinks.  Overall, I'm in love with this place. And it's going to add that extra chicness that DTLV's hipster scene is becoming.   Very exciting to see how Downtown Las Vegas will be a year from now.  YAY, DOWNTOWN PROJECT!!!!!!",

    "text": "Park on Fremont is a great place to not feel like you're in Vegas. As an aside: don't you feel like people say that a lot? Like, \"oh, go up to Mt. Charleston, you won't feel like you're in Vegas.\" Or \"x place doesn't feel like it should be in Vegas.\" If we feel that way and we are so quick to point it out, why are we in Vegas then?   Just a thought.   Anyway.   Enormous beer list and cocktail menu. Awesome decor. Not super unreasonable prices. I didn't try the food but the drinks are great and the atmosphere provides for good conversation. One sour (literally) spot: wafts of sewage can and will spoil your afternoon patio experience. They burn incense to try to cover it up, but just like the other smell that incense usually tries to cover up: it can only go so far. Sucks for Park because there's nothing they can really do about it.   Vegas vacation :)",

    "text": "The Fremont Street area of Las Vegas has got much better than I ever seem to recall. Park on Fremont is a cool establishment. It's a little kitschy  and has an outdoor patio. I can't imagine the patio on a 120 degree day though, must be brutal. The menu is comfort food spin offs while the drink list comes across as a joke. I had a chicken and waffle sandwich which was  fatty and filling. I enjoyed a couple of their beers off their big beer list and enjoyed myself. It's real good that Vegas has a place like this to change things up. Is it a sign of the times or is it a place that just found it's niche? Who knows?",

    "text": "Park on Fremont is a trendy new addition to the bustling downtown scene. The art and taxidermy inside are a very interesting choice of decor and they remind me of a trendy little place I once dined at in San Diego. I've only even had the pleasure of dining here for lunch and it's never very busy. It is pretty small inside, but they have plenty of outdoor patio seating. I can see this place really bursting at the seams on a warm Vegas night. The menu is small, but the drinks look absolutely delicious (I can't wait to try one), here is the low down on the food.   I highly recommend ordering the mac and cheese balls! They are ooey and gooey on the inside and come with a yummy creamy dipping sauce. I wasn't impressed with their fried pickles, the batter wasn't crisp enough and they just weren't dill enough for me. The mac and cheese Philly sandwich is a kitschy take on a Philly cheesesteak. It was pretty good, I just wish there was a little more cheese flavor and a lot more steak. I had mine with a side of their sweet potato tots that all of my friends had been raving about. I was disappointed with the tots. They were dusted with a cinnamon sugar and that just doesn't go well with a savory sandwich. I remedied this by ordering the regular fries the next time I had lunch here and was still slightly disappointed. I really wish they could nail a French fry! The fries were just a little sad and cold. I did, however, enjoy the burger I got, but it's not super hard to make a delicious burger in my opinion. My advice, stick to the bar bites and the drinks and enjoy the people watching!",

    "text": "I prefer Downtown Vegas over The Strip. It's more my kind of crowd. We came here after a summer rock show at the Fremont Street Experience. It was so hard to find Park on Fremont as they don't have a sign in front but in the BACK by the parking (wtf?) Maybe they want to seem mysterious and low-key? *shrug*  The rating for this place was good and I love me a good gastropub. It was PACKED which is a good sign. It has a hipster vibe and many people kept trying to get in. The whole street was poppin'. They played good music. The inside looked classy and the back patio was cozy in an enchanted garden kind of way. Getting seated was lame. The hostess seemed so bored and bland. She had no personality. We were lucky enough to spot and steal a table for 2 on the patio facing the street *slick* :)  The rest of the service was fantastic by everyone else we encountered. I don't know the waitress' name, but she was Asian and was an excellent server!!  The classic cheeseburger was thick, soft, juicy, and full of flavor! It fell part which was a bummer and it was a little too pink in the center for my liking (it was even too dark for me to tell for sure HOW pink it was) but it tasted AMAZING. The french fries were freshly cut and tasty. My boyfriend got the Mac and CheeseSteak. He said it was good.  But the best part were the sweet potato teeter tots! OMG! Heaven in my mouth!! We'd never had anything like it. They were so soft and creamy yet crispy. It's hard to explain but it's a must try!! Also to die for is the Unicorn cocktail. We chose this one of the 3 signature cocktails they offer. It's ginger-based, mint, lemon. MMMMMMM!!  I can't wait to go back to Vegas!",

If anyone doesn't know what a hipster is or what a hipster restaurant looks like, COME HERE!! Lol. They have a picture of a lady with a meat dress on the wall and tons of other cool pics to look at inside. They play great music from 80's Prince to Today's hits. We didn't get a chance to go outside to their patio since it was 106 degrees out so I was kind of bummed about that. But next time!  Came here around 230pm on a Friday and it wasn't too bad. Sat inside at a booth adjacent to the bar. I ordered their Strawberry salad and Mojito and shared the mac n cheese balls with the Hubs. SO GOOD!! Everything! The salad was super fresh and the mojito....OMG. I could have had 3 of those easily. But, I would have been a drunken mess if I did that. The Mac and Cheese balls hit the spot! It's served with cheese to dip in. Yum!  Our server was friendly and brought out everything quickly and made sure our drinks were filled. The price is a little pricey but it's to be expected for Vegas. They have a patio outside and a little one out front too. They are located on Fremont St past all the casinos and craziness. They do have parking lot right next to the restaurant but I see that filling up quickly at night.  Can't wait to come back when it's a little cooler and sit outside!",

What happened on Friday evening was out of everything I have ever seen and heard. I understand that NYE/NY is stressful time being at work (or in general working in a place like Las Vegas) but wow.  We arrived with our group of friends (who had just gotten married that day by the way). We wanted to sit outside and out waitress told us that it is \"no problem\" and \"we get the heaters for you, I'll come back when you have all settled.\" There was a guy who was dealing with the heaters and one of the guys in our group asked \"How long is it going to take, we are freezing? Just wondering if you need any help...?\" The guy didn't say anything so we just assumed he was okay.  Service was good, food was good and we tipped above average.  When it was time to leave, two people from our group decided to have two shots (hello, they got married that day! Why not? :) )   This was when the \"fun\" begun.  The bartender told them \"I don't serve you anymore. Get out of here.\" Our friends were like \"Excuse me? Why?\"  The next thing he did was that he asked the security guy to walk them out. Our friends asked again \"Why?\" since no one had said anything or done anything that would have been consider hurtful or out of order.   The security guy had a HUGE ATTITUDE problem and after few rants he PHYSICALLY grab  one of the girls (waist) and tried to push her out. When her boyfriend was trying to tell him that he is not allowed to touch anyone (especially since she didn't even said anything, just stood there not understanding what's going on) the security guy said; \"I CAN DO WHAT EVER I WANT TO IN MY BAR.\"  When another person from our group went to the guy asking what is going on he said to her that \"oh bitch, you are with them too? Get the fuck outta here! You are not welcome.\"  Okay dude calm down.   I feel bad for Park on Fremont that I have to write on Yelp a review since when I tried to complain thru phone the management (or how do I know if it was management after all, I wouldn't be surprise that it was the same guy who was working on the bar that night ha!) wasn't heard at all.  I would love to have some sort of response and APOLOGY. If not, I will unfortunately have to take this further.",

Got here probably 8pm and walked back to the patio which is amazing...  Trees, artwork, fireplace...  They have the ambiance nailed down.  All the patio furniture is very retro and just fun.  There is a little corner entry that goes back to another patio section with a see saw and a more intimate feel.    We didn't eat here but just came for the drinks.  They were incredibly priced.  I felt we drank a lot, between shots, beers, margaritas, etc.  Our bill was a total of $38, maybe.  The music they play was fun and brought back memories.  I see a lot of people complaining about service.  It was on the slow end, but nothing that I would complain really about.  We weren't in a hurry to get anywhere, just enjoying the vibe, the conversation, etc.  But I can see where they could prob bring on another person or two for shifts.",

We are seated by a friendly server.  We take a few minutes to look over the menu. I will say the beer selection was better than i had anticipated. I decide to order a chocolate flavored dark beer. To my surprise this place has an item on their menu which is a combination of two of my all time favorite comfort foods. Mac and cheese and Philly Cheesesteak. Wow. Gimme one of those please!   My sandwich arrived promptly and to no surprise was actually quite delicious. Was it the best Philly in town? By no means, but it was a creative take on a classic and it was real good! The mac and cheese sits on the sandwich nicely and gives it an interesting texture and flavor. My chocolate beer arrived in a cold can and and it was ok too.   The prices are fair, the food is good and the atmosphere was great!",

    "text": "Location Location Location! So lovely to see a venue with style. This new gastropub situated at the corner of Freemont and Las Vegas Blvd between Radio City Pizza & a parking lot   (hence the name) is a lovely welcome to the ever changing DTLV.   The decor is warm. Distressed wood is the framework surrounding the copper lined bar. There is seating for the bar that is both indoor as well as outdoor. The front of the space has a minimal patio that is facing the front entrance as well as the small part of the side facing the lot. It's white picket fence that frames the patio seperates you from the fact that you're literally  part of the street and lot. The floor wood pattern layout is stunning.  There are black and white sketches of animals/skeletal that add to the setting of the space. The indoor seating is all banquet with booth tables that are suitable for large groups. The seats are upholstered with fun patterns in different colors that add to the charm of the place. The staff uniforms were hipster chic and alleviated any concerns of haughtiness you may have. Maybe because it was Easter Sunday a few of the servers looked more bored rather then being engaging. Hopefully these are just opening weekend kinks that need to be smoothed out.  And now the highlight...The secret garden. There is a lovely beer garden laced with flowers and charming metal garden furniture. It is peaceful and isolated in the back of the space. Its a perfect spot for a small gathering. They even have a minature bar that could be set up for exclusive use of the back space.  Definitely worth a visit. Great spot to hang with friends and sample their many varieties of beers and cocktails. I loved that they had a unique takes on the bloody mary. They claimed to be out of a few beers because of their opening weekend so I hope that problem won't be ongoing. Mason jars of all sizes for beverage service too.  The only reason I deducted a star was because the steak mac & cheese came on a bun. It was carb overkill and took away from that deliciousness of the ingredients. We also tried the chicken bar bites and I say kudos for the crunch, flavor and crispness of the snack sized treat.  I wonder if the proprietors took notes from the ever successful neighborhood bars in the LES & Brooklyn, NYC. If you've ever been to the Meatball shop you'd know what I was talking about.The resemblances were uncanny and truly welcomed by an NYC transplant who is homesick time to time",

We sat down (Party of three) a few minutes before 4pm. A man came bye to stick a Happy Hour Menu in the bucket on the table, did not acknowledge us at all... which is a bit off putting but whatever, we all really wanted to give this place a try. About ten minutes later we are greeted by a waitress who let us know, we would receive menus from another waiter... Okay. The same gentleman who put the HH Menu in the bucket passed us twice within the next 10 minutes, serving other customers and did not acknowledge us the entire time... So here we were sitting for about 25 minutes and have yet to  receive menus or be acknowledged by our server. I cannot believe that we would be left unattended for that long, at happy hour, at a very uncrowded bar/restaurant, right in the heartbeat of Fremont. Disappointing to say the least, I live here, the food being served is far from original. We got up and left.",

Menu is on the smaller side but well rounded and thought out. I'm from New York, and in a way this felt like an approachable yet trendy Williamsburg joint.  I shared the chicken and waffle sandwich with a friend which was a great portion and came with some sort of whiskey infused syrup. We opted for sweet potato tots as our side and they did not disappoint. On the sandwich the chicken was crispy and tender, the waffle was soft and sweet and there was booze in the syrup-- what's not to love? Had some of my friends Mac and Cheese balls as well and almost stole her entire plate. Crunchy outside, creamy cheesy goodness on the inside with just a little kick.  Drinks were a good size and strong. One friend didn't like his and our waitress immediately noticed and offered a different choice which says a lot about their attentiveness.  Can't wait to come back!",

The gracious hostess moved us to the back patio with no hesitation and wow, what a surprise!  Tree covered and decorated in oddly humorous antiques. The waitress was efficient and smiling, the food was out of this world!  We had some bloody Mary's and they were great too.

We sat on the front patio on a sunny and 70s Saturday afternoon for lunch and it was great to sit back and people watch. He got a burger with crispy tots and I got 6 honey BBQ wings. Both were delicious as expected. Service was a bit slow, but it seemed like the servers worked well together because we had 3 helping our table. Thanks again!",

The decor is fun and eclectic (by that I mean bawdy and raunchy in the best way possible.) A treat for friends and family from outta town. So what I want to really zero in on was the bloody mary selection. Should I stand in the mirror and say bloody mary 3x or I could make life easy and head on down for their awesome cocktails? Clearly go there and save yourself the scare and mess.  For lunch I had their cheesesteak sandwich with a salad. My mom and aunt had the chicken cheesesteak with regular fries and the other with sweet potato tots. My only complaint is the ketchup. I know, I'm that basic white person that's picky about ketchup. In their defense, if you're not a ketchup person, I'm sure you'll love it. Also I didn't ask to see if they had the regular stuff because I think it's rude to the chef to do that. Ehh whatever, ask it's what you want, just my two cents.",

The decor is kinda like your crazy cousin's chic bungalow and I was living for it!  Aside from the fact that their wallpaper, chandeliers and outdoor patio are decor GOALZ they also serve up some amazing cocktails.We were able to walk right in during happy hour, but they also take Yelp reservations which is pretty sweet.  I love that happy hour included a $5 shot with purchase of a beer, my kinda place!  Our server was super nice, and helpful when it came to selecting some local beers. We also ordered fried pickles, calamari and mac and cheese bites. THOSE MAC AND CHEESE BITES THO - perfect for soaking up the many cocktails we enjoyed.  The cocktails were also absolutely delicious and well priced. The unicorn - which is a botanical vodka drink was great. I also had the hopster, which is a tequila based drink with grapefruit beer and I loved it.  Happy to have discovered this gem upon my visit to Vegas! If I was a local, I'd be here often!",

From the decor and design, to the crafted cocktails and food, it's such a good vibe.   We stopped in after an event for my work that was held close to here. I brought my friend from Miami that was visiting as well since it's one of my favorite spots down there. We started off with some ice cold beers. I had one of my fave local beers in Vegas, a Joseph James. It was incredibly refreshing after being out in the heat for a couple hours.   Happy hour was also about to end so we ordered some bites. They had macaroni and cheese bites, which are always my FAVE usually on any menu. Must be my pallet of a 8 year old child shining through. The cheese that accompanied those bites really did it for me though. It was so creamy and flavorful and served as a nice balance to the cheese and texture of the bites.   We also ordered calamari and fried pickles which were also delicious. The fried pickle weren't too heavily seasoned, which I really liked. They also had this really interesting and delicious sauce to dip them in as well, which was scrumptious!  Will definitely be back many more times!",

I had a frittata with goat cheese bacon and tomatoes with potatoes it was delicious.  My son had French toast he loved it. All our food was good and so was our service.  There is public parking right behind the restaurant which was nice as well.  If your down town you really need to check this place out.  There's something on the menu for everyone.

    "text": "Adulthood has never been more fun.   We stopped by Fremont Street to grab lunch while visiting Vegas for a wedding, and I was instantly enthralled by the Park's gorgeous patio and unique neighbor.   The Park is located at the entrance to Fremont Street in Downtown Las Vegas. Next door there is an outdoor art exhibit created by Lyft to be explored - which includes a ton of instagramable backdrops.   I think what really makes this spot stand out is it's fabulous atmosphere. Inside there is a large bar, booth seating, and Alice in Wonderland-esque artwork.   The Park also has two separate patios: one that overlooks the start of Fremont Street (great for people watching) and another that has been tucked away like a secret garden.   We sat in the latter and enjoyed the quiet escape from the craziness of Fremont. For a cocktail I ordered the Flower Power, which is a twisted take on a traditional Redbull Vodka - elderflower liqueur, fresh lemon juice, Tito's Vodka, and Redbull yellow edition. I absolutely loved this cocktail, and am hoping to recreate something similar in the future!   For a meal we ordered the Avocado Egg Rolls and the Chilaquiles to share. The egg rolls were the perfect balance of crunchy and creamy, plus the sweet tamarind cashew sauce on the side was dreamy!   Sadly my lack of a star is due to the Chilaquiles. I thought this meal was beyond disappointing. It was soggy, filled with watery eggs, cheese, and salsa. This isn't something I'd ever consider ordering again in the future, but I would like to explore more of their menu.",

I enjoy Park on Fremont's location because you can people watch or still have the feeling of being outdoors while sitting inside.  They have bottomless mimosas for brunch. $25/person. Downside is you have to get it a glass at a time and make sure to down your drink before the next pour. I'd sure like a pitcher, but guess I can't complain because that's a great deal!  I've been here before and can't remember exactly what we ordered, but I do know their vegan burger is good and I'm not a vegan.  This time my date and I ordered the Mexican Chicken Chilaquiles Verde. He ordered one without cheese and sour cream, and I got it with everything. It was really good!  Yes, Vegas is hot in the summer and I know this place likes to keep their windows open. It wasn't so bad, but still a little warm inside.  I'll definitely be back here to try more items. Maybe next time in their back patio spot!",

We sat out back for a quiet dinner. It was beautifully decorated and light up with white lights. An adult sized seesaw was hidden behind the back wall for some extra fun. Great service from our waiter Tom, excellent food. I had the brisket sandwich and we were there for happy hour with half off drinks and discounted appetizers. Will return next time in Vegas!",

They are also one of few places that serves Mezcal, and I had a great Mezcal Margarita here as well.   Starting at about 1030ish, they have a Dj, and the back patio area is super cute- and there's a small \"secret\" back there as well. Yes, like most bars on Fremont East, it gets busy and you may have to wait for a drink, but that's to be expected. I will have to come for the food at some point, but for now, I've enjoyed my Park on Fremont experience!",

It came with tater tots and a delicious sriracha mayo. SO yummy. The perfect start to our day. I would totally come back here for brunch if I'm in the area.",

The patty was so juicy and flavorful that you couldn't even tell it wasn't real meat. The fries that went along with it had the perfect kind of crisp and the spicy ketchup that went along with it complemented the entire meal.   I also ordered a drink called the unicorn which was a refreshing cucumber and mint cocktail. Delicious food and drinks that are decently priced and service is awesome too. Highly recommend.",

Upon arrival we were informed that brunch wasn't served until 11 but that we could be seated and peruse the menu until then. This was totally fine with us!  Service was a bit of a sour spot. It seemed that our waiter was taking care of everyone in the back patio area. We waited about 15 minutes to just receive glasses of water. This continued through our experience as it took about an hour to recieve food.   Pro Tip: The bottomless mimosas come by the glass and are pre-mixed. We had asked the waiter to confirm before ordering, but we neglected to see and he didn mention there is a patio pounder option which is unmixed mimosas. Had we known this would have worked better for us - it's a bottle at the table you can serve yourself and you can control the juice ratio. I ordered the salted caramel spiked coffee then a pillow talk - based on recommendation! The pillow talk is very refreshing! Get this when sitting outside in the sunshine.  The food was really good when it came to us! We shared one order of the garbarge fries, with waffle fries, and OMG we devoured this. We definitely should have gotten 2. For my meal, I had the egg sandwich with tots. It was prettty typical.  The fried doughnut bites were a favorite of the table for a brunch dessert.",

Second, the server brought out my bar chicken bites with a buffalo sauce smothered in it, I was surprised at this because the menu stated that  they can come plain with sauce on the side or smothered with a choice of sauce. I assumed the server would of asked me which sauce I wanted, and since she didn't I figured all sauces would come on the side. When I asked the food runner AND the server why it came out smothered in buffalo sauce,  they BOTH said \"that's just how it comes\". Now how am I supposed to know that since she didn't tell me? I then asked for some bleu cheese for my chicken since they were smothered in buffalo sauce. The bleu cheese never came.  The service was subpar, and the place is trying too hard. I won't be coming back.",

I had the fried egg burger with fries and a Blood and Bulleits Bloody Mary that was being offered on the summer drink menu. The husband had the buffalo chicken sandwich (added avocado) with fries and cleaned his plate. We shared the mac and cheese balls and they were awesome!

Well, a meeting was scheduled in Vegas for my job and I had to organize a dinner for 14 ppl from Denver and Houston, and myself. I had no clue where to go but I knew they wanted to be on/near Fremont St downtown so I put into Open Table for 15 people for downtown LV and 2 options came up, Park on Fremont and this pizza place (which we had just had pizza  for lunch) so Park on Fremont it was. I hit gold. This place is such an amazing find!! The back patio seating was an unbelievable atmosphere, the art and decor is so cool, the food was amazing and the service was on point. Everyone who works there was so nice and attentive but not all over you, we were there 3 hours and not rushed at all. Everything was so great and I scored major points with my group for taking them here. I will definitely be back any time people come to visit me! Such a great experience, thank you Park on Fremont for making it such an awesome time for my group.",

This recent visit was unfortunately, the worst service I ever had in my life.  My friend and I decided to stop by Park after running the Glow Run. We went to the back patio and sat at a table. There was one server and one busser running around. The server never came by so we had to wave her down. She rolled her eyes and annoyingly asked \"Yes?\" OK, I understand there is only one of you but I am a paying customer. I couldn't believe she said that. We ordered with her anyway because we were starving after that 5K. 15 minutes passed...25 mins...nothing came out and we haven't seen the server since. We stopped the busser and told him that we've been waiting and he took our order again. AGAIN. Another 20 minutes passed it just wasn't worth it to wait. I will NEVER come here again. They should have been adequately staffed for a busy night and hire friendlier people.",

When Bailey our serve brought them out to us we thought she was kidding. The drinks are served in tiny mason jars probably about 6oz. Her response was they had alot of booze. Well, I had the stranger danger which tasted like watered down ice tea. The wombat tasted like grapefruit juice and actually had a peice of glass in the drink. The manager did come over and bought another drink to correct the mistake. After drinks we started with the mac balls. Then we ordered dinner the chicken and waffle sandwich(the chicken was horribly dry), steak salad (I literally had 3 thin slices of steak on my salad) the chicken balls (again dry) and the ribs ( again over cooked). So our food comes out and Baily has forgotten the mac balls. 10 mins later with dinner almost done we get the mac balls. BEST PART OF THE WHOLE EXPERINCE! They were so good. When every one finishes we ask for the check to be split in half with 2 credit cards. Some how this gets screwed up and ends up taking us 10mins just to pay for our dinner. Point blank I wouldn't go back. The food was all over cooked, the drinks are poor quality and over priced.",

It was a good vibe, good for people watching, and our total bill was $ 50.00 and I left 20% tip.  We went inside to check out the place when we were gonna leave and the inside was really cool and much cooler (weather) even if there fron door is completely open.  The bar was packed.  We went tot the back & there is a pretty garden and unique decor.  There was a lil' smell but it is next to an alley.  Parking next door is expensive but we parking across the street in a hotel parking took the elevastor and it brings you down to where Hennessey & heart attack grill are and all you have to do is cross the street and you are there.  Park on Fremont is cool, I recoomend it, and I will return.  It's smack on the corner nect to Radio City Pizzy, insert coins, the Griffin, the Von guard Lounge, and the downtown area is much cleaner.  I heard Zappos dropped some money for that and renovations.  I will post pic's soon.",

Service absolutely needs to be improved but they just opened so Im sure in a few weeks the speed and quality of service will be improved greatly. The employees were all very kind and excited-- just working out the kinks!  Everything was lovely! We first arrived and were seated on the front bar side patio. I had been very excited for Park to open as I had seen images of the interior and it looked like an artists own personal version of Alice in Wonderland. The back patio opened at 6 so after our first round of drinks we moved to the back.  It is lovely-- down to every detail we truly appreciated everything. Its trendy, artistic, perfect for downtown and it definitely is going to be a local hotspot.  Its somewhat similar to Commonwealth but its more like its Hipster sister.   Ordered stuffed sprout & swiss burger with sweet potato tots-- ketchup was homemade spicy which was very interesting. Overall really delicious-- can't wait to go back!",

Stranger Danger if you enjoy sipping on some sweet tea with a little twang, pillow talk is a straight up fancy pinky up treat and the kumquat mojito was refreshing although quite sour, but I've never tried kumquats before, so maybe? Anywho all the drinks come in mason jars, and the shots come in smaller mason jars..very cute.  Tried the nachos. I would compare them to Taco Bell's mexican pizza with added steak.  I dug it.  They had EXCELLENT sweet potater tater tots.  One bite and I was transported to homeroom class in high school.  I reached in my pocket to snack on some delicious..oh wait...that never happened.. but what did happen was the party in my mouth. Nice work Park on Fremont.",

My husband choose the pound of wings and beer for$10. We ordered other beers since it was happy hour we assumed we would be getting the happy hour price.  We one server cleaning our empties off the table, we had another bring our food out. The person who took our order and brought us the bill stood on the wall playing with her hair. When I looked at the bill I learned we weren't given happy hour prices. When I asked why I was told \"because it's Wednesday.\" Ummmmmmmm ok..... Why advertise happy hour if you're not going to honor the price?!? When emails were sent to management they've read them and ignored them. Again the food is really good. But just don't even bother reading the happy hour menu. It's just False advertising.",

    "text": "I love all of these new doors opening Downtown. Its starting to look like a real metropolitan downtown! I have been wanting to come here since it opened and finally had the chance to stop in Saturday night. The hostess was super friendly and gave us our choice of seating. We chose the backyard garden as I heard it smells of nagchampa, which I could definitely get behind. The decor is very original, if not a bit, 'hipster', but delightfully so. Think Vice magazine in restaurant form. Having already eaten, we opted for the very clever drink menu. I started with the Unicorn, which was delicious. We sat and nursed our drinks for a couple hours without being rushed or hurried to clear the table even after business picked up around 10:30. I ordered a second drink and shortly after receiving it, asked our server if they could hold the table for five minutes so that we could hop into the back-backyard to smoke. She said that'd be fine so we went and played on the teeter totter (yes, the teeter totter) for a few minutes. When we returned my almost-full second drink as well as our other beverages had been completely cleared and the table was reset for new service. We continued to sit and chat while waiting for our check to come. Our server walked by a few times and hesitated, noticing our table was completely cleared. She didn't comment on this and went about her business, serving up many rounds of shots and drinks to a nearby table. Finally, upon receiving our check, we waited another 20 minutes before we could get her back to the table. I explained to her that I didn't get to enjoy my second drink as the table was cleared while we were out back. Without hesitation she apologized and had it removed from our bill. Though, I was happy with the location, atmosphere and drink selection, I was disappointed in the service. There were a lot of people there, but a lot of them seemed to be standing around bored as one or two were running in circles. I will come back to try the food as I have heard amazing things, but we'll make sure to take turns smoking to ensure our table remains ours.",

The owners of the Park have a great ambassador on their hands, in fact I wonder if she is actually one of the ownership partners?  Prompt, informed, very engaging...and the amazing finish, she offered us free desert as she felt like she ignored us due to unusually high business demands this night and the fact she was working \"both the front and back areas\"  all said with celebration of the popularity and great buzz rather than the usual complaints of servers having too much work...Thanks Lorelei for a great and memorable evening.",

I'm a pretty big fan of this place, only because it seems like the only real alternative option to my favorite bar The Griffin.  Commonwealth is great but has a line a lot, and Downtown Cocktail Room is also great but is usually empty.  I don't care for the other bars on the block.  Park is great because there's 3 distinct areas that each have their own vibe... the front patio, where you can chill and people watch, and it's awesome if the weather is good.  Inside the bar it's just your run of the mill bar, but has it's own style of exposed wood and stuffed animals (not what you think).  And then out back is this huge backyard playground that if you wandered in off the street you'd never find.  The bartenders I've dealt with here have all been pretty damn friendly, and that goes a long way to my bar selection.  Add a good beer list and not too expensive prices and you've got a winner in my book.",

They have delicious cocktails and snacks, since I am a vegetarian I never had a full meal there, but their garbage fries and fried mac&cheese are pretty delicious.  I've had all kinds of cocktails there and my favorites are the peach sangria and the unicorn.   What I love the most about Park is the decor. I am not a fan of taxidermy, but if you are going to do it, I guess making the animals have sexual positions is the way to do it.   If the day is nice, I recommend sitting in their whimsical patio and if you are just slightly drunk, try the see-saw (only for the slightly drunk).",

A must go....on and their Chicken and waffle yum their Mac and cheese Sammy poppin everything else also very satisfying.

It's different: an homey restaurant with artsy decor and reasonably priced, albeit good tasting, food and drinks. The great cocktail menu is solid and there a slew of beers on tap and in bottle.  The guy checking IDs at the door was a little strange. He forcefully asked to check my luggage before I walked in. Terror threat at Fremont? I guess so.  Best approach: Get overwhelmed on Fremont Street, drop in for dinner and sit in the backyard. Order a few cocktails, admire the wild wallpaper after using the bathroom, and enjoy a few small plates in courtyard peace.",

That being said, the patio out back is a gorgeous garden in the middle of downtown LV- totally unexpected, and pleasantly so. I highly prefer it over the front patio, which is chock-full of exhaust fumes.  I've mostly stuck to appetizers and drinks here- the Trophy Wife is my drink of choice while here, and the wings are old-school style but nothing really blew me away. As others have said, the mac and cheese philly is good in theory but not executed well.  Staff seem to be MIA most of my visits, which is fine up until a certain point- I like to be able to converse without servers pestering me or making me feel obligated to order a new drink every time mine dips below half-full, but it would be nice if they seemed to care about their patrons.",

They won me over with the first impression. But then we waited...and waited...and waited...and waited a little more for the waitress to come over. We knew what we wanted. So we placed our order and once again played the waiting game. It took over 20 minutes to bring our cocktails, which is totally a shame...because their cocktails were DELICIOUS!

The appetizer was crispy, well seasoned, and filling. After the pickles we ordered the cheesesteak and chicken and waffles.  I liked both so much that I begged my husband to split the meals 50/50 just so I could enjoy the flavors equally. Btw, the tots are friggin bomb.  Loved everything about this place.

    "text": "I loved it here. I was alone on a little getaway to Vegas and I thought I'd try Park on Fremont and sit outside in their little garden area I'd read so much about. It didn't disappoint. Outside is simply beautiful and the food was great. I did the \"Build your own Burger\" with sweet potato tots. I also tried their cocktails. Pillow Talk(Pear Vodka, Lemon, Orange, Strawberries, Cucumber and Club Soda) was my favorite but Stranger Danger(Peach Whiskey and Iced Tea) was also very good. I felt a little bad for my server because I stayed so long but I don't feel too bad because I kept ordering and it wasn't a very busy night. He was very nice and chatted with me for a bit, always made sure to look over when he walked by if I needed anything.   I can't wait to come back!",

They have a strange collection of animal and children art. Imagine a Disney move on acid, turned into paintings and wallpaper. Weird. You have to go just to check out the decor of this place.  They serve giant 24oz \"Tall Texan\" beers for just a few bucks, and a variety of liquors.  The staff was fairly friendly, and even offered a tour of the place, straight to the back see-saw where the smokers are allowed. Elsewhere, they're forbidden.  We found this in some sort of Maxim Magazine's coolest Vegas Bars list. This ranked near the bottom of the top ten, which is still impressive! The crowd was mainly hipsters drinking PBR in the can.  They offer a menu of delicious sounding bar food, but we didn't order any.",

Next time I'll opt for the champagne special, $25 for a bottle with oj. On a side note, there was an eccentric old gentleman there, reading his paper, obviously down on his luck, but the staff was kind and polite to him, served him coffee at the bar, and were very accommodating to him. The landscaping was stunning, chests of drawers overflowing with greenery and flowers, beautiful spot for brunch.",

The staff were all happy and smiling, also very helpful with menu and drink questions. I ordered the pillow talk cocktail. I'm not usually a vodka person but I enjoyed the drink. It was fruity and refreshing but not to sweet since there is club soda. I ordered the Stoner sandwich with fries. The portion size was big. I ordered extra peppers which made it perfectly spicy. Pastrami was good, The quac was fresh. Wish the bread was a little softer but that's just a personal preference. The fries are beer battered and crispy. The place is Chic and has good vibes! There is taxidermy behind the bar with some pretty funny scenes. The restaurant area is full of cool unique pictures of animals and nice high top tables. There is a patio area to sit at if it's not too hot out and there is also a rooftop area. Service was good, food was good, drinks were very refreshing on a 110 degree day! We will be back next time we are in town. Doug was our bartender/server. He was great. Paul was the bar back, he was also good.",

It has awesome potential to be a cool spot for hipsters, locals, rockabillies and tourist (like me) looking for the local spots. Came here and was told to have a seat anywhere you'd like. I swear everytime I'm told that no one ever comes to find me. ANNOYING. I finally tell the bartender I have a table f 6 outside and to inform somebody we are out there and times continues to go by. We even see a table of 2 get served before us. Ugh.  Well we finally get a server and I swear he was high or maybe just a LV transplant from Cali Valley. Real deal surfer on acid kinda dude. Anyway by the time he got there we were ready to order. He was moving so fast he barely got our orders right. Now to the food. Mac n Cheese Balls pretty good Tacos cold and steak meat chewy Corn Dogs from the frozen section Garbage Fries the bomb diggity  MunCheese pretty good  Won't ever be back. Service was weird and slow.

    "text": "F*$%ing Beautiful. That sign is perfect for the outdoor patio at Park.   I love Park! It's another one of the finds in Vegas that gives me a feeling of being back at home in Columbus (OH)! Some may describe it has \"Hipster\" - and rightfully so... just don't grab from that, that it's Snobby Hipster. Park on Fremont is the approachable Hipster. The Hipster with an Android phone. The Hipster that doesn't quite commit to riding bicycles EVERYWHERE and sometimes grabs an Uber.   Park is pretty small inside, so plan to venture outdoors as there is plenty of outdoor seating. But if you sit inside, avoid that back booth, unless you've got really small thighs. I mean REALLY small thighs. My friends and I once sat in that back booth and we had a hard time getting in/out. The bar is pretty cool though and the bartenders all seem pretty cool as well.   My favorite thing about Park, aside from the chicken and waffle sandwich, is the secret garden in the back... so be sure to explore your surroundings!   I've ordered a cheeseburger and fries, chicken and waffle sandwich and wings and fries. Park has some of the best French fries! They're always the right amount of crisp. The cheeseburger was pretty standard, but the wings I had ordered really surprised me. The Chipotle BBQ sauce that they used is really good! Not too much of a kick but just enough to leave you wanting more.   My absolute FAVORITE dish there though is the Chicken and Waffle sandwich. It's pretty big so bring your appetite if you're going to be ordering this dish. There is a fried chicken breast nestled between two waffles and some bacon. The chicken is the perfect amount of crispy and juicy. You also get syrup which makes the waffle easier to bite into. You have your choice of a side, I've (so far) gotten it with a salad and sweet potato tots. Go with the tots, they're pretty darn good as well!   Park has an awesome (brunch) drink special - $20 for a bottle of champagne and enough orange juice to make quite a few mimosas out of. So if you're looking for a downtown brunch spot to drink, go to Park!",

    "text": "Today the weather was perfect at 85 to sit out on the back patio for lunch. Meeting my friend, I was so excited to finally try Park on Fremont after walking by a few times since moving here, but not having the time to go inside.  Arriving around 11:30 it was pretty dead, I sat outside with my friend in the fun, beauteous rear patio full of floppy cushions, mixture of chairs, trees and raised planters with ferns and succulents, flowers, statues and a large fireplace, and dreamy artwork. Inside appears just as fanciful with colorful, chimerical wallpaper and chandeliers in carrying sizes and shapes. The bar has a large taxidermy exhibit cases, lending to the whimsical feel of the entire place.  Our waitress came over and was very friendly, recommended a couple cocktails and food. My friend ordered a Moscow mule of gin and muddled berries, she loved it, I had The Unicorn, vodka and lemon and ginger beer, amazing. We ordered to share buffalo wings (Wednesday is wings Wednesday specials), Mahi tacos (fantastic), and ahi salad (huge and yummy).  We sat out on the back patio for 2.5 hours, our servers were attentive and food great, the place was full when we left.  The manager was awesome and tried to adjust the $20 parking fee my friend had at the adjoining lot, but couldn't and adjusted our bill to apologize for the ridiculous parking fee. The lot is not directly related to POF, but the manager was disappointed that the lot charged my friend so much when she said she was eating next door. I thought that was great he went out of his way to remedy that. He made 2 new customers for the future!!  We'll be back to POF.",

    "text": "This place gets 5 stars for ambiance and much to my dismay only about 2 for brunch, thus a three star review is born! I went to Vegas with some girlfriends for a long weekend and this was our last stop on our way out of town for brunch. It had great reviews and the photos looked fantastic but our meals were very lackluster. Three of us ordered huevos rancheros and although the menu said there would be chorizo, we couldn't find any. It was basically an uncooked corn tortilla with beans and avocado. Not really what huevos rancheros are, or what we were expecting from the description. Our other issue was that our waitress never asked if we wanted the bill split and when we asked if we could do it she said it could only be split 3 ways (there were 8 of us) and that we needed to mark the receipt how we wanted it split. We were annoyed but we made do. When we got the bills literally each one was messed up and we had to all pay each other the differences anyways.   In summary: not worth the hype.",

    "text": "After having walked past Park on Fremont numerous times exploring Fremont East, our party of three decided to stop in and check it out.  I first noticed the very interesting interior design with wallpaper on the ceiling and stuffed birds behind the bar.  You don't see that everyday.  The smaller size of the restaurant/bar added to the overall feeling of intimacy.  Were greeted by our server Joe soon after being seated.  During the course of dinner he was attentive, fun and added a nice touch to our great experience.  OMG!  The Fried Mac and Cheese balls were seriously delicious-I could eat them all day.  They had a nice and crispy shell with a gooey bacon-y (is that a word?) center. Plus, you can't go wrong with ramekins filled with hot cheese and a wing-type sauce for dipping.  For dinner, I ordered the Mahi Tacos.  At first, I was slightly disappointed at how small they were, but after tasting, I realized they packed a great flavor punch.  The fish was flaky and delicate with a crispy tempura batter, not over-fried.  The tacos were then topped with a creamy chipotle dressing. Yum.  My partner ordered the classic burger which was 1/2lb topped with American cheese, red onion, tomato, iceburg lettuce, and Thousand Island dressing;  it was cooked to a perfect medium.  I took a bite and had it had a nice beefy flavor.  Along side the burger were crispy fries and a house-made Sriracha ketchup which added a nice zippy touch.  No Heinz here.  Then, my partners cousin ordered the BBQ Texas Burger which she was very happy with; topped with BBQ sauce, cheddar cheese, pepper bacon, and an onion ring.  The standout for her were the sweet potato tater tots served with a honey mustard maple dipping sauce.  I had a few and thought they were amazing.  I only wish I would have ordered a side for myself.  I'm so glad we decided to stop in and try out Park on Fremont.  We will be back for sure.",

    "text": "This is one of those rare occasions where I must say that the 4/5 stars that I giving in this review is truly based off strictly the atmosphere and one food item on their menu, but that one food item is so extraordinary that it by itself could garner a 5/5 for this entire venue.   I have dined at the Park on Fremont twice. Once at night and once when they first opened at 11am. On both visits, I ordered different entrees and one standing appetizer: Garbage Fries. The Garbage Fries are amongst the best loaded fries that I have ever experienced. The mixture of two different cheeses, onions, fried egg, and seasonings make these fries simply decadent and an delicious indulgence that I have not found a comparable equivalent anywhere. They are a MUST ORDER item that alone make the Park on Fremont a required visit, even if you detest hipsters.   The atmosphere is another plus. Though it certainly is designed and geared toward the hipster crowd, no question, it still provides a wonderful location right on Fremont with a great park-like patio that wraps around the restaurant. The rear patio even has a teeter totter for those wanting to feel young again. The people watching is phenomenal though you should be prepared to get stared at right back. The beggars are only a few feet away so that does detract a bit but nonetheless, it is still a great spot outside. The interior is hipster and whimsical with Trivial Pursuit cards on every table for entertainment and weird art on the walls. Overall, it is a great all around atmosphere.   Now the negatives:  1. Though the garbage fries are incredible, I have not found any of the other appetizers or entrees to be that spectacular. The beef tacos are great but not a great value. The chicken and waffle sandwich is a bit bland and the sweet potato tots are usually lukewarm and an acquired taste at best.   2. They do not allow kids to dine there after 6pm and prior to 6pm, they can only dine on the patio.   3. Parking. Though there is a parking lot right adjacent to the restaurant, it is a paid parking lot that is privately owned. Your best best is to park at a casino and walk over.   4. Though I personally do not find this to be a detractor, many will: this is truly Hipster central.    Overall, I like the Park on Fremont. Great location, atmosphere and signature fries that are quite possibly, the best in Las Vegas.",

Was looking for a late brunch/lunch and wanted a spot on Freemont street with some outdoor space, and Yelp helped me find this place. I'm glad that we ended up here. We managed to snag the last table on the front patio. I noticed that they also have a cute back patio, but given that it was a bit nippy, I'm glad that we were in the front patio because it got a lot more sun than the back patio. The interior of the restaurant is eclectically decorated! I liked the idea of the outdoor bar window. Seems like it might be fun to sit there, but we weren't able to snag a seat there.  The menu is actually pretty limited, but I thought that the food was all solidly prepared. I ordered the fish and chips and my friend ordered the fish tacos. The fish and chips were good -- no fishy taste at all! I tried a little bit of the fish tacos were pretty good, but small, and it didn't come with a side. We also got drinks. I ordered the Bloody Mary (served in a mason jar, of course!), and my friend ordered the berry mule. I thought that the Bloody Mary was pretty good, but the berry mule was a bit odd. The service is a bit slow on the patio -- I think that they might have been understaffed because our server took our drink order, but then got waylaid by taking drink orders from another large table on his way back to the bar to put in our order.",

I got the fried egg burger with sweet potato tater tots (juicy meat but egg didn't add much maybe because it was cooked completely through.. Tots tasted like not tasty fried balls of mash... None of the characteristic crispy bits) and shared with friends the Mac and cheese balls (nothing special, and we had two orders for the table and one came out with smaller but crispier balls.. How inconsistent) and the garbage fries (pretty good).  Overall the food was all over the place in taste and quality. Although the tots were highly yelp recommended , I say no thanks and get the fries.

Our waitress really knew the menu and cocktails well, giving her recommendations because it was our first time there.   The Mac & Cheese balls by itself were bland, but dipping them in the side of cheese sauce made it taste better. The fried pickles were tangy but not too sour, and the sauce that comes with it really complements each other. They are also known for their fish tacos, which I didn't get a chance to taste, but my friends said they were good.  I also ordered the Pillow Talk Cocktail recommended by the waitress. It's a fruity cocktail, but it wasn't too sweet like juice. It was more like a refreshing drink because it had cucumber and mint in it.   Overall, the experience was great.",

Philly: By far one of the most innovative yet flavorful Philly cheesesteaks I've had. I've had my share of Phillies that lacked boldness in flavor which is why I normally order them with provolone cheese, but this one just nailed it AND with Mac and cheese. I liked that they added breadcrumbs on the Mac and cheese because it added that extra texture to the overall sandwich.  Garbage fries: Did not taste ANYTHING like its name. Just from looking at it, it doesn't really look like it would be that flavorful, but I was so wrong. The fries were fried to perfection without it being way too greasy, and the egg complimented the dish very well. I'm almost convinced that the boldness in flavor came from the sauce that they used. Either way, suuuper delicious.",

This time we have a dog so we're extremely limited where we can be. Luckily, PoF is pet friendly in the patio with many patio heaters. Their decoration and theme are so beautiful, even in the bathrooms lol.   We ordered: Tokyo Tater Tots, Steak Tacos, Honey Mustard and Buffalo Wings, and the Grilled Chicken Greek Salad.   Wow, every single of the dishes was delicious. My dad really enjoyed the honey mustard wings. We were all pleasantly surprised by the Tokyo tater tots since the description sounds pretty odd at first. You won't be disappointed with any of these dishes, any one of them would be a great choice!  Our server was really friendly and continued checking up on us, even though we were the only table seated outside.   It's hard to find a restaurant with ambiance, dog friendly, great food, and good service, even in LA where we're from. Park on Fremont checked off on all three and has become a must try spot for us whenever we return to Vegas!",

Excellent people watching, my personal favorite was drunk Santa.  Door staff was pretty friendly and sat us as the hostess was somewhere else. I love when a place works together.  Our server was also great. Quick with the drinks and friendly.  I ordered the Philly cheesecake topped with Mac and Cheese (yes, topped) at our server's suggestion, and it was pretty delicious. I really like that you can order a salad as a side option, and it was really good. (Greens, blue cheese, tomatoes, I think & balsamic vinegar) My friend ordered the steak salad and raved about it, although she was still a little hungry later on.   We stayed after to have a drink at the bar. I love that you can sit at the bar and still be outside, another excellent people watching spot. Double, tall drinks seem to be the way to go. Bartender was cute and genuinely friendly. They also have pull tab wine containers. I didn't try it, but my friend seemed to like them. I was stoked to see that they had Hangar One Citron,  We looked for the see saw out on the backyard patio, but didn't see it.  One thing I wasn't so thrilled about. It seems for some of the entrees (steak Salad) they use disposable bamboo plates. Doesn't seem so great for the environment.",

I have come for brunch twice and ordered food once after First Friday.  I have also been in to grab drinks from the bar on several occasions.  The first time we came for brunch our server was awful. First we sat at our table for about 20 minutes before anyone greeted us.  Finally our server comes over and it doesn't get any better.  It seemed like it was her first day serving EVER since she couldn't give a single recommendation on what to order and even messed up several of our orders.  We were a party of 6 and it took 30 minutes to get drinks.  Finally our food came out and the portions were quite small. Good luck on splitting checks here even if you tell the server you want separate checks in the beginning.  I know that servers hate that but Vegas is a tourist town and any restaurant should expect groups to come in and want to pay separate.  It took her about 45 minutes to split everything and finally bring us our checks.  I decided to give their brunch another try and came back with a party of 4 about 6 months later.  Same thing. We sat for about 20 minutes before our server came over.  She seemed rushed and had zero personality.  The food came out and the portions did not get any bigger.  Drinks took forever and so did our food.  We paid with 2 credit cards and just split it so it was a little easier on the server.  Both meals I was never thanked for coming in by the server or any staff member.   If you come in the summer months put on plenty of sunblock as there is little to no shade protecting you while you sit outside. I saw a lot of customers dripping in sweat.  We stopped in after first Friday and sat in a booth inside to get drinks and some food.  Again server was aloof and seemed hurried.  After seeing this on 3 separate occasions I would tell management to hire more staff or servers who are more experienced and don't seem so frazzled.  All that aside this bar is hip and fun and also has a secret seesaw in the back of the bar.  My advice: come in have a drink with friends and jump on the seesaw for kicks then head to the next bar.  If you want to grab a quick bite don't expect to be out in under an hour.  The fried pickles are good as well as the chicken and waffle sandwich. Overall there are much nicer brunch spots in Vegas that have better service, bigger portions, and tastier food.",

The French toast ($10) lacked a good sear and was soggy -- unable to hold up to the custard it was soaked in. Topped with mixed berries, it was an unspectacular dish. Even worse was the fried chicken and waffle sandwich ($11). A thick, oily breading coated strips of breast meat and were sandwiched between soggy waffles. The best of the items we tried were the mac n cheese balls ($8). Five per order and coated in a light layer of panko breadcrumbs, the mac n cheese inside wasn't half bad when compared to the other dishes.   The almost-garish decor makes for a good conversation starter and photos. Who doesn't want to see a classically painted portrait of a horse mounting another horse? Park on Fremont might even be a good place to grab some drinks, but you should make sure you grab a bite to eat elsewhere.",

I ordered a bloody Mary and this is where my major problem is, I read menu and I got the bloody Mary that was most expensive mainly because of the description it said fresh mix of tomatoes served with a pickled egg and a extra crispy bacon strip.... not what I got and this disappointed me. Mix is fresh as described and actually very tasty, egg was not pickled it was just a plain boiled egg not what menu said, bacon was cold and not cooked very well nothing crispy about it again made me disappointed. Service it was okay could use to pay a bit more attention to their customers and know more about what they are serving the bartender she lacked at know about the drinks they serve and their specialty beers. Overall not bad but serve what you describe otherwise it's not worth getting drinks there.",

I'm talking about the service not the food. The food is beyond excellent I don't know how they do such a great job on the food and not a good job on the service.maybe our bartender/server was having a bad day I don't know but she had a bad attitude and no personality. And the service wasn't good to begin with, it would be a different story if she was actually doing her job, it wasn't even that crowded or busy. Actually seen a couple people leave while they're waiting to be served. But I must say the chicken wings are probably the best I've had. The fish taco with feta cheese were excellent.bottle of ultra $6-our check came out to 39.40 or something like that,she didn't bother giving me my change..lol . Kinda funny I got my receipt but no change.. Probably won't be back, probably won't rave much about this place to all my friends.. happy hour was more like frown hour LOL.. cheer up young lady bartender.. it's called the hospitality industry.",

The decor and ambiance is a little spooky but cool if you are into the whole goth creepy kid look - I didn't get a chance to walk around and see the back area but I'm sure it's cute.  The restroom light is dim and sets a mysterious mood when you are welcomed by strange wall paper of distorted orphan-like kids and framed portraits.  Also, there was a sign on the mirror that said \"workers had to say bloody mary three times in the mirror before going back to work\". AHHHHHH!!!!!    Our waiter was a super hot dood so that was a plus.  We had their specialty drink: Pillow Talk for $9 it was tasty but it would have taken four of these drinks to get me on a nice buzz. Appetizers: Chicken Wings $9 not bad.    Definitely should check it out!",

I was very disappointed with my experience. The bar tenders were extremely rude and seemed inconvenienced to be making us drinks. I don't really understand why because we had a large group who were all gracious tippers and not to mention friendly people! I had been sitting by the bar and overheard multiple bartenders talk badly about my group not knowing that I was also apart of that group. Complaining that there were too many of us and we were \"too loud.\" I was unaware that we were supposed to be whispering at this bar. There was also an instance when we were trying to take a group picture in front of the bar's sign which we were to later post (advertisement) and a female bartender made a snappy comment that she needed to get through our picture so that she could work to a couple of our group members while we were in the midst of taking the picture.   Overall, I was extremely uncomfortable here and do not plan on coming back. If you are planning on doing anything group wise this place would not be the bar for you. They prefer their bar not to be crowded and make sure you use your inside voice.",

It was just my luck though that we chose the worst night to go. The backyard area was closed off for a wedding so we couldn't sit back there and the tables inside were reservations only, so we were sat on the front patio. This would've been fine if it wasn't 100 degrees last night! All of the servers were really sweet though and understood how hot it was, so they helped us out and got us a seat inside because one of their reservations got pushed back a few minutes so they said we could take the table if we could be done before the reservation. We thought that was really nice that they went out of their way to accommodate us.  We all ended up getting the Steak Tacos which were delicious! I had a big lunch earlier that day so I just wanted something small. It came with 3 tacos and they were the perfect size for a small plate. I also had one of their Moscow mules, which was very refreshing since it was still really hot inside the restaurant.  I definitely wanna go back, but will definitely make sure it's nicer outside next time!",

We actually had a homeless person come up and take food off of our table while we were eating and then proceed to wander through the patio. Not necessarily the restaurant's fault, but definitely put a damper on things. I feel like this could have been avoided if there were more staff, but there were just 1 or 2 people inside of the restaurant.  I had the chicken bites and boyfriend had the chicken waffle sandwich. Both were decent, but nothing to write home about. The chicken bites were lukewarm by the time they got to me, but the sweet tots were decent! Boyfriend said you couldn't really eat the chicken and waffle thing as a sandwich and also mentioned that the waffle seemed pretty soggy.    It definitely seemed like the kind of place you go to for the hipness of it rather than the food.",

The day we went was Wednesday which was the first of the \"Wednesday's Downtown Street Festival\". We walked in and we were looking for the host person when half way through the bar she decides to seat us. She was pleasant  and the waiter seemed like it was his first time waiting, a little unsure of the menu and not real skilled at customer service but not rude. My son ordered the Fried Chicken and Waffle Sandwich and Mac & Cheese Balls.  I was gonna order something cheap as I wanted to eat elsewhere when he finished, so I tried to order the Cheese Straws at $5.00 the cheapest things on the menu except for dessert and they told me they were out of that item.  How do you have a big event happening Downtown right in front of your establishment and not have everything prepared for a big crowd?  Mind you that they open at 11:00 am. and we were there a half hour after opening.  My son ate half of the sandwich and a couple of Mac & cheese balls and said he didn't want to finish the rest of it, which he usually scarfs everything down.  He told me that it wasn't  ALL THAT.  This place wants to be soooo like California bars and restaurants but it doesn't hit the mark as far as I can tell.  Oh and there is a small park like setting you reach once going through the bar area if you choose to want to sit outside.",

Am I ever glad we stopped in!  The drinks are especially unique and it's a nice change from the typical Freemont Street spot to grab a snack.  Definitely more upscale than the usual with friendly staff, good food and unusual (and very delicious) cocktails. Drink prices are average to the other bars nearby, but the quality is much better.  If you're going to spend $8 for a cocktail on Freemont you'll get a better drink here than at the frozen drink stand down the road.  We had a couple of appetizers, a couple of cocktails and some good conversation with Chris, our waiter.  Definitely recommended!  I will be stopping here for sure next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "First off, the food and atmosphere here is pretty darn good. I live in the area, so it's a nice place to bike over to and grab lunch. The patios are beautiful, amd the inside is comfortable. I love the San Diego Burger, and the Tacos are pretty good for a plqce that doesn't specialize in tacos.  I'm writing this particular review to talk about the service. When Park on Ftemont first opened, I had a number of great dining experoences, but recently the service here has been, for the most part, mediocre if not outright nonexistent.   In most cases it was simply that the servers had unenthusiastic attitudes, no smiles, and an apparent overall distaste for having to be at work that day. A number of the times the service was slow, and it was hard to get the servers attention without them seeming annoyed.   I understand that this is a pretty high traffic place in the evenings, and none of this is normally bad enough to mention. I mention it now because of the problem I had with the hostess the other day.  I was planning on going to take part in Taco Tuesday with some girlfriends, but I was interested in bringing my sister who was not yet 21. I called ahead to see at what time they stopped searing minors. Since I had been there before with my sister, and had even eaten inside, I thought I had heard the girl on the phone say she could seat minors on the patio after six. When we arrived I told her we had minors in our party and asked if we could sit on the patio. She abruptly and demeaningly informed my party that minors were not allowed here after six. When I began to explain I had called someone earlier, she broke in before I could even finish to say \"that was me, and I can't seat you.\" Taken aback, I turned around to walk out with my group. As we left, she mumbled \"Have a nice day.\" All as she sipped on what looked like some sort of mojito based on the color and the muddled mint in the drink.  I was aware that I may have misheard what she had said on the phone, but the fact that she was so unapologetic and just plain mean made me never want to go back.  I'm sure I'll get over it eventually because like I said, the food is good, but I'm not a fan of the \"exclusive, you're-not-worth-our-time, cool-kids only\" vibe the employees have been giving me. It makes me want to go there, and take new people with me, a lot less.",

Once we signed the bill and paid, the security guard asked us to leave. I said, \"Excuse me? Are we being kicked out?\" And he said yes. I asked him why and he looked a little embarassed and immediately said \"Would you like to talk to my manager?\" And I said yes. So a woman came up to me saying someone complained about us. I asked what the complaint was and she said someone was offended by us. I asked what we said or did that was offensive and she could not tell me. In the mean time there was a group of college kids with LSU t-shirts next to us cheersing shots and being very loud, and yet MY small group of 3 people who ate dinner and had 2 drinks was being asked to leave for being offensive! I couldn't believe it. And especially with no explanation. I will NEVER go back there and I tell all friends and family to stay away. Our waitress was nice, even the security guard that was asked to kick us out was nice, but the woman who said she was the manager was the one I blame for the offensive treatment.",

We were seated by the staff, seated by staff and were just about to order when a different  staff member came and told us rudely we had to move.  Of course we asked why.  \"These seats are reserved\" she said, although there was no reserved sign on the table AND WE DIDN'T SEAT OURSELVES - THE HOSTESS/WAITRESS DID! She demanded we move.  They offered us a table with 3 chairs - for 15 people?  The manager came over and said \"You should have made reservations.\" and my response was \"If you didn't have seats for us why on earth would you seat us? Why weren't we told 'I'm sorry, but we can't accommodate a large group\"   We happily left and took our business across the street to a bar where the staff actually seems to communicate with each other and want the business of actual, long time downtowners.",

    "text": "Great restaurant! The food was so delish! My wife and I went here for brunch and literally got everything on the menu! Here's a few items I found especially good, the Mac and cheese balls were very good they weren't to heavily breaded and the cheese used inside as well as the bacon were both very rich, the cheese balls were unlike any others I've ever had. The garbage fries had pretty much anything you could think of putting on French fries only it didn't taste like garbage ;) the jalapenos and the fried egg on the fries were absolutely to die for and had it not been for park on Fremont offering this dish I would have never thought to add these toppings to cheese fries. The chicken bar bites were so flavorful and the interesting thing about this restaurant is they don't use traditional breading on most items they actually use a corn flake \"breading\" which adds an interesting flavor profile to the dishes. I must close this review by commenting on the drinks. My favorite offering here was the Derby Breakfast Club, the drink was a very very delicious Bloody Mary which contained bacon infused rye whiskey, Bloody Mary mix, hickory liquid smoke, a huge strip of bacon and a hard boiled egg... This drink was a meal in itself but it was the best damn Bloody Mary I've ever had in my life!",

Very cool atmosphere with funky art and decorations. Reminded me of the mad teaparty from Alice in Wonderland. Hidden behind a back wall is an adult size teater totter. (No pics were taken as Bubs catapulted me off when he sat down). It's Vegas price, so $10 - $12 a drink. Their house made Mary mix was tasty. Could have been a little spicier, but good none the less. Lots of complaints on here about the service being slow, but it seemed fine to us. Would like to come back to for their happy hour.",

We happen to be in here during Happy Hour, which runs from 4-7pm every day. They offer $4 well drinks and a bunch of discounted appetizers.   We ordered their chicken wings, tater tots, fried pickles, and steak tacos. The steak tacos were ok but the fried pickles and tater tots were awesome. Food was hot and freshly cooked, flavorful, and filling. We also had drinks that were tasty.  The servers were attentive and quick. This is a cool place to eat and hang out in Freemont.",

    "text": "This is such a fun place that feels simple with a quiet quickness amid all the neon and flash of Fremont Street. This corner bar is decorated with amazing and slightly creepy art and hilarious taxidermy birds that it may be worth it for the decor alone.  Yet that doesn't keep me coming back- the creative easy shareable menu and well balanced craft cocktails are what keeps me returning. We were a party of four and we ordered the Tokyo Tots, Crispy Brussels sprouts, Mac + cheese balls, eggplant lettuce cups and the great Greek salad with chicken.  Great small bite style food that was shareable and delicious! The Tokyo Tots were so good, a bit spicy and uniquely flavored with nori strips and a sweet soy glaze with a saracha aoli to provide a tasty heat. These were amazing and were not that spicy even for the less adventurous in our group. The crispy Brussels sprouts may have been my personal favorite- they had a great flavor, slightly sweet and crunchy with pink lady apples added to the mix. Mac and Cheese balls are a bar staple, but these are perfectly done- lightly breaded on the outside they have a great crunch which pairs well to the creamy cheese filled inside- and for extra gluttonous flavor - they sprinkle them with parmesan and offer a cheese dipping sauce! The eggplant lettuce cups are a make your own with cold crips iceberg lettuce leafs and this amazing stir fry blend of eggplant and mushrooms with a miso glaze that is bursting with flavor!  I didn't try the salad because it had chicken in it- but it looked AMAZING! It was full of ripe red tomatoes and bell peppers and beautiful tender slices of grilled chicken- my friend said it was very tasty and she lived every bite!   For drinks we ordered The unicorn, Flower Power, pillow talk, and the trophy wife. The Unicorn was smooth and lemony flavored and really well balanced with Citron Ketel one, lemon, and ginger beer. The Flower power (which is what I ordered) had Tito's and Elderflower liqueur, with fresh lemon and Orange Red Bull- it was different than I expected with the red-bull. It had a really delicate flavor that was floral but not overtly strong. The garnish of a purple orchid really made it better. My husband ordered the Pillow Talk and he isn't a big drinker but he loves this one so much he always orders it! It is so refreshing with Vodka, pear syrup, fresh mint and strawberries muddled together and a twist of orange and club soda with a cucumber slice garnish- so good, but in the dangerous way. The trophy wife is tasty in its simplicity- with Rum, and a great blend of lemon, orange and pineapple juices.  This is a great small tucked away spot with an excellent back patio and quiet for conversations and to grab some great drinks, and tasty bites but not a full on meal (though you can do that too) while you are enjoying the Fremont Experience.  I can't wait to go back again!",

Comes in my mason jar and this place over all is pretty hipster. They even have a seesaw in the back.  Kara is super sweet and made sure my water cup was never empty! What made my visit so awesome was how accommodating they were. I had a weird request... I wasn't hungry but my friend has a pickle that looked really good with his meal. All I really wanted was a pickle. Kara did not judge and even brought it out as as arrangement in a mini bucket. They were fresh, kind of sour and had a nice crunch to them.",

A waitress or bartender will be with you shortly to check if you have any questions/offer water. We ordered their mac & cheese balls, fries, and tacos to split. The mac & cheese balls were OK, but the fries and the tacos were bomb. The fries, especially, were really good. I think we contemplated ordering another one but decided against it as we were almost due for our reservation at another bar.   Our waitress was super friendly and helpful. She answered all our questions and didn't badger us when we were just sitting and chilling with our drinks. I would definitely recommend and come back to Park on Fremont if I'm in Vegas again.",

It's was perfect timing because they were offering happy hour!  We all shared an order of garbage Fries - although we requested sweet potato tots in place of fries. I'm amazed they didn't do any kind of up-charge for the switch! Awesome. I feel like I didn't see quite as much bacon as I'd like, but there was plenty of jalapenos and lots of their delicious cheese sauce!  The burgers are build your own with all the basic toppings you could want. Hubby made his own while dad and I created one to share. We did a beef patty topped with bacon, a fried egg, bleu crumbles and avocado. It ended up being a decent burger - not life-changing, just fine. But I quite enjoyed the side of regular Tots we ordered with it! They were nice and crispy on the outside and we're seasoned well.   I would definitely go back for another happy hour and get those garbage tots! But maybe next time I'd try another happy hour item - Tacos perhaps?",

The location in DTLV is pretty good though, they have a patio that is basically on Fremont hence the name ;) The bar seems pretty cool and very hipster. I am pretty sure DTLV is the hipster Capital of Nevada ;)  The beer selection is good and the craft cocktails are pretty adequate too, pretty expensive for DTLV...but I guess that's the new downtown! And I am not complaining, they are doing a great job cleaning it up and putting good culinary spots in.   The wings were just ok, nothing special. I liked the fried pickles and garbage fries. The pulled pork sandwich was pretty good. Nothing including the service really blew me away, it was hard to track down the waitress half the time.   I think I need to come back for a more fair assessment and a more complete yelp review.",

Sadly, the tough steak took away from enjoying my meal. I had a hard time cutting into the slices and chewing, but the marination and flavor of the steak was good.   I think I drank a good 8 mason jars full of mimosas before I could finally get a good buzz. Which made me wonder if they over pour orange juice in it or the champagne isn't as strong as decent champagne usually is. Then again it is $20 bottomless for a reason.   The place is super hipster and fun, which I love because it does give you something to look at and enjoy while waiting or sitting around. The backyard is super fun! Think the backyard is all there is? Nay! Follow the wonderfully decadent china wall and to the end you'll find a small opening where the fun teeter-totters are hidden! What fun! We had a ball with that one and any person who says they don't teeter-totter, I guarantee you a few mimosas later you'll be riding that thing like charlie brown!  The service was very attentive always asking how we are doing and constantly refilling our drinks. Sandy they ran out of mimosas right before we could order one last one before it ended, but high tens to the bartender because she was nice enough to give us one last round of shots to end our happy hour. As you may predict, that awesomely tasteful shot that I cannot name had probably been the beginning of a very downward spiral turn of events for that night. Not so much sad turn of events, but more hangover memorable.",

The drinks are okay at best, but the food feels forced and I really wish they'd just sell drinks and concentrate on making them taste good.  When I'm snackish I always order the fried pickles and I'm always a little disappointed.  They are okay, but it's (again) not a lot for the money, and are served in this parchment paper in a tin cup.  I get that they are trying to be hipster with their stuff, but it leaves the food mushy at the bottom.  Blech.

Weird sign on a Friday night on Fremont East. 2. It was 630pm, and they had a door man in full blacks with a clicking counter and sleazy hairdo. 3. We waited several minutes to be carded, because this doorman was carding the foursome in front of us that we're all obviously of retirement age or greater. 4. Once we were carded, there was no recognition of being locals.. inconvenienced locals that live mere blocks away. 5. The ineffectual hostess sat in front of a sign reading \"Please seat yourself\" while the ineffectual doorman made confusing and unsolicited food suggestions (\"You gotta try that thing with the... umm.. mac and cheese, yeah!\") 6. Once we had sat ourselves at the outside portion of bar, our unsmiling, but otherwise friendly, bartender came by to get our order. 7. He did apologize for being out of cherries for our cherry cokes.  8. Food took 30+ minutes despite low guest count. 9. The ahi tuna \"salad\" was not a salad at all. It was 7 lovely and pretty perfectly seared slices of ahi, 3 slices of Hass avocado, 3 forkfuls of spring mix with a little too much dressing, and a drizzle of a sauce I couldn't put my finger on. Not bad at all, but should have been offered on the appetizer menu and not described as a salad. 10. Fiancee's Cajun chicken sandwich and fries were delicious. The roll was fresh, the fries were as good as ever, and the chicken cooked through but not dry. We will order this again. Overall I took a star for this review because of this lackluster experience this time. I will hopefully give them their star back next time!",

Did you all get together and decide that the average price for a quality beer is going to be 8-10 bucks and that PBR will be 2 dollars?    The decor in the bar is pretty cool with interesting stuff to look at. They also have a decent selection of micro brews from out of state, both bottled and draft.  Service this night was a very slow start.  I sat at the bar inside for nearly 15 minutes before being greeted.  Finally someone came over and expressed surprise nobody had taken care of me yet.  Umm, you're one of the ones ignoring me too, haha!  After the slow start, service was OK...basically what I've come to expect on this block in Vegas...not great, just OK.  Are all of the bartenders on this block newbs?  Me thinks so.  Call center tech support by day, attempting bartending by evening is my guess.  Anyway...for dinner I had the Philly Mac and Cheese.  What's that you ask...well it's their version of a Philly cheesesteak with mac and cheese plopped on top. I was skeptical to say the least but figured what the heck I'll give it a shot.  So, I'm from Philly...doesn't compare at all but the added mac and cheese on top made it unique enough that I would recommend trying it and may even order that again myself.   My plea to all owners and managers on East Fremont:  figure out a way to get your staff to be on point.  The trendiness of your location only goes so far; repeated subpar service will drive your clientele away in the long term.",

I ordered the San Diego burger and my wife had the steak salad. We also ordered a side of the fried pickles. I have to admit that I was not impressed. The meat on the burger was way too much and you couldn't really taste anything else. The steak salad was ok but definitely nothing to rave about. The fried pickles were ok but they were soggy and cold by the time we got them. Now I understand that having good delivered can and will affect the food quality but even having said that I don't know if I would ever actually eat there again because it was just mediocre and they don't have a lot of options on the menu.",

The cool taxidermy, including the antelope with chrome gold antlers and machine guns, the oversized Ryden giclee of the girl in the meat dress (lady gaga's inspiration??). We ordered a pitches of the red wine and brandy sangria, garbage fries, and fried pickles. The garbage fries were awesome, pickles were good but we liked the fries better. If it wasn't so late, would've done the philly or chicken'n'waffles. Next time!!!",

You can often find me down there any given night at Le Thai, Griffin, or even Commonwealth when my resistances are high.. haha.  PARK ON FREMONT is a nice addition to the mix.. though I still feel as though it leaves a bit to be desired.  The highlight of the establishment is the back courtyard with a fireplace and greenery that resembles something like a combination of the Secret Garden, meets Alice In Wonderland. Ample seating, a fireplace for when it gets a bit chilled out there.   The service was good enough and most people were very cool.. but I wasn't overly stoked about the food or the food prices. I will most likely give it another go to make sure it wasn't a random situation.. but I am not really rushing back for the food. The beer selection was good enough also, and some descent cocktails including something like 4 different types of bloody mary's.  A-OK..",

We were agonizing over which beer to buy, and the bartender gave us tasters and took really good care of us.

All smoking is relegated to the delightful see-saw area in the very  back of the courtyard.  This means I can sit at the bar both inside and outside AND in the courtyard dining area without the stench of cigarettes.  That in itself is reason to hang out at the very eccentric Park.  Couple this with the $10 beer-and-a-shot menu --and I mean GOOD beer and GOOD shots, I had a Wexford's Irish Cream Ale and a Jameson-- and I find the Park as the first Fremont East Bar to make it into my 'downtown rounds' list. *I'm a bit sad that they got rid of the veggie sliders, without those, I see little reason to grub here.  But I will still drink here.",

    "text": "I've been to Park two times since it opened. The first time it was amazing, the weather was nice since we got there around 7pm. Ambiance is amazing and quaint and I really want this place to do well so that is why I'm writing this review.   The second time I went there I went around 12:30pm and asked to sit on the back patio. That was a mistake because the sun was blazing hot and there were no umbrellas, fans, or misters. It's not even summer yet and the outside will miserably fail if something isn't done to change that. So everyone was moving tables and switching spots to avoid the sun.   Which brings me to another problem that Park probably won't be able to fix as easily ... The patio side is up against an alley, where all the trash from surrounding bars is dumped. In the sun, the smell was so horrible I felt like I was going to throw up, I don't know how they're going to fix that issue. But you can't expect to serve food to people when they're smelling rotting trash. Revolting.   Then, we ordered the Mac n cheese Philly and the bar chicken bites... But it took 55 minutes for the food to come out at 45 minutes for anyone to realize there was an issue with our order. A manager never stopped by to apologize and at the end of the meal they removed one item from our bill.   I've worked in the hospitality industry for over ten years. I know it's not all the waitresses fault, however managers need to be more aware of what's going on in their restaurant. (I saw them dealing with contractors so I'm assuming they were preoccupied) ..regardless, get ON your kitchen and get the food out! The servers need to be aware of their surroundings, one girl passed us literally ten times and after we had already been waiting for food for 30+ minutes she asked if anyone has taken our order yet.   I want this place to do well so badly and I'm hoping this review can be used to fix these problems for the future.    One star for my previous positive experience, no stars for the remaining issues.",

Both waitresses were not attentive. I decided to order my drinks at the bar to get my dinning experience started after 20 minute wait and not even a water. Throughout the night several of my guests had to refill their drinks at the bar because the waitress either never came to the table, forgot the drink or failed to see our several attempts at waiving her down. Waitress was not interactive and didn't seem happy to be at work.  Once again they ran out of advertised pickled eggs for the Derby Breakfast Club :( And the lettuce in my  Strawberry Salad didn't have a clean taste to it. I really think that the owner should be taste testing the food regularly because everything is pretty bland. The price of this place is good but the food should be amazing!  The appearance/concept of this place is amazing! The designer of this place did an awesome job. As a customer, I think the back yard needs more lights against the walls.",

If we don't get one of the many rude waitresses, we get extremely slow service. Well come to think of it, every time we went there was extremely slow. Sorry Park, we all really tried to make you happen. We wanted to like you with your cool drinks, good looking menu and sweet decor. You just made it so damn difficult.   Oh. And your tap water tastes very very off. I'm a local and so far yours is the only place that I've questioned the source of tap water.",

We sat on the back patio for hours, the garden is peaceful, the fire is cozy, and the sun felt perfect! Hopscotch was a definite plus. Park on Fremont definitely took me to my happy place!

    "text": "The general ambience is adequate.  It has a shabby chic charm. However, the service and management proved to be rather terrible. When we arrived, we were glibly told that there was no more food being served. So we opted just for drinks. My girlfriend ordered a Long Island iced tea and I a Manhattan. Both were served completely wrong. First, the Long Island was served in a cheap plastic cup, and was made completely wrong. It tasted more like lemonade than anything else. We weren't even sure it was the right drink. My Manhattan came in a tiny rocks glass and was actually served on the rocks. There's no way if it was properly made to portion, that it would have even fit in that tiny glass (with the improperly added ice). It tasted like barely more than a Bourbon on the rocks. The bartender had no clue what he was making or how to make them. And for paying $24 for the two drinks, they should have been made right. Not to mention that if you walk down the street to Atomic Liquors, you'll get the best Manhattans made in all of downtown. Beyond all of this, we were part of a group who had called ahead and told them we would have 30-60 people coming. And at $12 a drink, that's a lot of money. However, the management treated us all like crap and decided to make it last call at around 10 minutes to Midnight. Really? On Fremont street in Las Vegas? What, does the staff have school in the morning? Save your time, your money, and the pain and just go to a better bar. There's plenty downtown that will make better drinks, at better prices, treat you better, and will stay up with you throughout the night--like a good grown-up bar should. A big 2 thumbs down here.",

It was a beautiful evening so we sat in the garden in the back and there were barely any tables sitting at the time. We got the garbage fries (with tots), which were deliciously and I would highly recommend. They came out in timely manner as well. However, over time the garden filled up pretty quick but there was still only one server. It took quite some time for us to get our entrees (chicken tacos, steak tacos, double cheese burger, and avo-turkey sandwich). The tacos were ok, avo-turkey would have been better warmed up but the burger was awesome! Only real downfall was the 1 waitress who was running around like a crazy woman trying to make sure everyone was satisfied but we were neglected refills on our water and waited a significant amount of time for our check and then for it to be processed. But that is not her fault, more so managements for not getting someone else on staff to help her out. I will come back especially to try brunch just hoping the service/timeliness improves!",

How rad!   BUT I have a few issues with the place.  First, if you sit outside, you will undoubtably smell sewage.  Also, sitting out back means you'll get poor service.  I went on Taco Tuesday with my friend.  Awesome deals: $1 Coronitas and $2 tacos.  You think the waiters would be walking around with buckets of beers because, obviously, people are going to order a shit-ton of them at a time.  No.  Of course not.  My friend and I ordered four total.  And about 20 minutes later, we got two ... then 20 minutes after that, we got our other two.  Don't forget about the 30 minute wait for our three tacos which should be being made at lightning speed since that's probably the only thing being ordered there on Tuesdays.   Also, the beer taps are really high so hiring petite girls as bartenders probably isn't the wisest decision because all you'll get is foam from the 5 foot long beer pour.",

Let's simply whisk you away to this deranged Alice in Wonderland fiasco. Here are a few of the mind-boggling sights that will forever stay seared in your cerebellum: the taxidermied head of a deer with nine-millimeters for antlers; a quirky bar sign that reads \"employees most say 'Bloody Mary' three times before returning to work.\"; a carriage on the roof; goblins under the tables; demonic happy waitresses.  The menu is standard bar room munchies; fried everything with enough transfat to kill a Tyrannosaurus Rex. The sort of list items any man can appreciate.

But that doesn't say much ...being Asian I was taught to finish my plate. It wasn't the best philly cheese steak I've had...it wasn't very cheesy. They replaced the cheese with mac and cheese. I think if they included both this sandwich would be complete.   I should also mention that Park is also a bar. My friend ordered one of the Bloody Mary drinks which looked really good. It was lunch so I decided to go non alcoholic and got a Jones soda.   I would come back and have been coming back because I am just in love with the venue. The back patio is adorable.

    "text": "2 Stars is what I am giving the Park. Let's break it down.   Pros: Let's talk about the good qualities of the Park. This place is super cute and has great style. Very mellow vibe, chill atmosphere. Cute patio seating. I recommend ordering the mimosas \" Patio Pounders\". The orange juice was really good and they bring your bottle of Prosecco on ice in this cute clear bag. They bring you some cute small mason jars to sip from. This was my favorite part of the experience.   Cons: Now, onto the shortcomings. The staff, definitely needs some fine tuning. When we approached the hostess she seated us immediately, once we were seated on the patio, it took 15-20 min. to take our order. Common, after a long night of drinking in Vegas, we were really hungry! 15-20 min feels like an hour. While waiting for our server, we smelled garbage, i guess it was garbage day in the lot next to the Park. Sitting and waiting on someone to take our order while smelling garbage is a horrible combination. My patiences were being tested at this point. I had to flag down a server to ask where our server was, seems like both servers didn't communicate as to who will serve our table.The food, wasn't anything special. We ordered Chilaquiles-never seen a version like this one before (everything came separated), Mini Corn dogs, Mac & Cheese balls and a burger. It was 3 of us who all ate and shared. The food wasn't as hot as I would like it to be, the oil they used to cook the food tasted old and upset our stomachs. The steak that went with our chilaquiles had a ton of fat on it, was super tough, chips seemed store bought. My friend asked for a diet Coke 2 times, as they forgot to bring it to her twice. We spoke with the manager and told her our concerns she was nice enough to take the items off the bill, I appreciated that. She was very apologetic about the situation.  Summary: Very cute place and has all the potential to be a great restaurant, has the look, but the food needs to be better. Better staff and more staff is need. It's all about ambiance, food and service. They missed the mark on food and service, which so very important in the restaurant biz! Would I go back? Ehhh probably not.",

    "text": "So the menu has changed from what some of the pics show. No more San Diego burger. The Mac and cheese balls are amazing. I ordered the classic burger it is as surprisingly good the meat was seasoned to perfection, it was sooo good. I will definitely be back   The sweet potato tots were not overly sweet, which was very good. The fries are very good seasoned with a lil kick.  The drinks come in plastic cups if there non alcoholic, the ambience is very artsy and trendy. There are stuffed animals above the bar with i find disturbing because I love animals and I hate seeing them on display...  The staff was very nice and attentive even though there are a lil busy  Make sure to get seated in the back garden it is gorgeous. A perfect place for a romantic evening",

These are just a few of the decorations that help to create a great funky Portland OR hipster vibe.   Ok you say. But what about the food and service. Well the waitress could have walked off an episode of Portlandia. Totally helpful and attentive in an easy breezy granola nonchalant glad you stopped by kind of way.   As for the food it gets mixed reviews. For an appetizer we got the garbage fries. The name belies the taste. Bacon, cheese, avocado, jalepenos covered fries should be named Celestial Fries.  Or at least Awesome Fries. They were fantastic. I orders the Chicken Waffles Sandwich. My dinner mate the Mac n Cheese Steak sandwich. It's just what it sounds like. a Philly Cheesesteak covered in Mac n cheese.   My companion chose wisely. While my Chicken and Waffles was ok his Sandwich was amazing.   Next time I am in Vegas I'll definitely stop in and order the Mac n Cheese Steak.",

Then a shot of patron and a strawberry beer for dessert. Even the sweet potato \"teeter tots\" were to die for.  Hubs and I both ate and drank for under $70 and were more then satisfied. I highly recommend this place for all you hipsters that hang out in \"old Vegas\", or you normal peeps out on a date. The atmosphere is rad. Ask to sit out in the back porch. For reals.",

This is a great spot right in the heart of Downtown Las Vegas. There is a little (expensive) parking lot right next door as well. Cute modern/borderline hipster interior. They have a beautiful outdoor garden seating area in the back.  I ended up doing a BYOB with fries to absorb the remaining alcohol left in my system from the previous nights shenanigans. It was perfectly cooked, and delicious! and not just hungover delicious it was the kind of burger I would want regardless of how sober I was.  My friend got the Strawberry Summer Salad and she said her was good as well!  We came for brunch and ended up eating off the regular menu. We will definitely be back to try their brunch and mimosas!",

Worst policy and business practice. We will never go back and I will personally tell anyone and everyone going to Vegas just how poorly we were treated. If I could give 0 stars I would.   The gall of the management to respond to this review restating their \"policy\" clearly shows me that they could care less how they treat customers. We were told 30min to 1 hour to \"accommodate\" us. And your web site not Yelp states nothing about your policy. Your on-site management handled it poorly and your response to this review is atrocious.",

Definitely will eat here again next time I am in Vegas",

We were seated immediately.  After about five minutes, our waitress took our orders for drinks; I ordered a water, my friend ordered a coke.   It took at least fifteen minutes to get our drinks.  Thanks to checking in shortly after placing our drink order, I know I'm not exaggerating.  When our waitress brought our drinks, she brought my friend the wrong drink.  We sat another ten minutes and without her coke.  We saw the waitress walk by with an empty tray and didn't acknowledge us or come back to take our food orders.  Since we were on limited time, we had to leave.  I suggest sitting at the bar if you're in a hurry or on a limited time, maybe the service will be faster and better.",

If you aren't wanting a mixed drink or craft beer, their specialty cocktails will knock your socks off. The food is usually pretty good too. This past time I was there, I was very let down. Service was absolutely horrific. We wished we could have tipped the hostess instead of our server. It wasn't very busy and yet our server  barely gave us any attention. She took our drink order and an order for an appetizer. We didn't see her again for almost 15 minutes. We tried waving her down but that didn't help. The hostess came over and took our order for us. I had ordered my burger to be cooked medium and it came out well done. We could have said something except our server only came by to give us our checks. Hopefully the next time we return service will be back to the way it was before. I won't name any names but that server was such a disappointment to quite a unique bar and restaurant.",

After 7 mins finally Alex asked for my order he puts it in and forgets my drink. One of the other bartenders named Doug ask if I wanted a drink and I told him \"the other guy took my order but I think he forgot.\" He grabs my drink and 3 mins later the first guy brings out a beer for me. Then time come for me to grab my check I can't get anyone's attention. One bartender Doug who brought drink he's actually busy. Another guy is talking to his customers. Then is making drinks and having Dan taste it but I can't get my check it takes me grabbing a host just to tell someone to grab my check. The time for me to grab her in between and waiting to get someone's attention 15 mins. I miss the old staff they had here. Two years ago best staff ever... now anyone can get hired here. Probably won't be back. I use to come every Tuesday for taco Tuesday but the staffed changed to much and service went down hill.",

But I love the decor, choice of artists prints hanging on the walls (Giclee Prints maybe? They're very crisp & framed beautifully), the back outdoor area, and the fried egg burger is my boyfriend, so I deal with it. Park gets 4 because I shouldn't HAVE to deal with bitchy servers. They need a Mother Hen (manager) that tells them how to properly provide customer service, or boots them out the door. Soooo close, Park, sooo close.",

Its still downtown so that's what happens. Accommodated our friends dog with them and we sat in their front porch area.",

Easy to miss unless you're looking for it. It's across from heart attack grill. Food is awesome and VERY reasonable compared to other restaurants in Vegas. The staff though, are the best part. Super friendly and helpful. Every one went out of their way from my initial phone call to the moment we left. Felt like a True locals hangout which is nice with so much of downtown working so hard to reclaim it's identity as iconic AND fresh/upcoming. Cheers guys, thank you for an outstanding meal. Anyone dining with minors will want to note the weather as this place is 21 and over inside, so it's outside seating only.",

After we reminded her about our appetizer(after our main meal was already brought to us and finished) she didn't apologize, all she said was, \"my bad\" and THEN PUT THE ORDER IN.

I understand the owner also has The Commonwealth- excellent place and Blvd Cocktail Company, also excellent. I don't know why Park on Fremont gets neglected or why it has the worst servers I have ever encountered, but it truly does. I wish the owner (forgot his name, nice guy) the best, but I wish we, the locals, would get his best in return for our year-round availability and patronage.

I came here with 4 friends and the hubs, we waited a little over an hour for a table (they were pretty busy) but we found space at the bar. They have an amazing selection of liquor and beer. I was shocked when the bartender told me they had Johnny Blue for only $21 a shot. I dont normally drink scotch at brunch but that was too good to pass up.  Once seated there was massive confusion to who was taking our table, server wise. About 20 minutes into us sitting with no service we had to ask the hostess what was going on. A girl finally came over but then disappeared again before we could order. Then another girl took over and she was awesome. I wish I could remember names but... i was drinking scotch at 11am lol Andy and I shared a few different items. We had the Garbage fries (OMG) Morning Skillet, and the Chilaqules. All delicious. Our friends all had the chicken and waffle sandwiches. Those came with sweet potato tater tots. The tots were the best thing on the table besides the garbage fries This is an amazing place to come when youve had a little too much to drink the night before. Amazing hangover/drunk food.  Needless to say we will be back!",

    "text": "There is a place bearing the same moniker in the Meat Packing District of New York City, and wonder if this place is related to that one in anyway.  The theme and decor seems the same (night time parkesque with urban touch) on both ends and struck me more as a prefunk joint prior to clubbing.  One thing that differntiated each other was that the one in New York was way bigger and two (and a half??) stories tall and had a dinner/lounge area on the first floor and a dancefloor/ultralounge motif on the upper level.  While Park on Fremont looked to be more of a gastropub.    I am no expert on the phenomenon and far from someone who can define a gastropub, but all the gastropubs that I have visited all seem to serve unique drinks or craft beers along with typical food with an eccentric twist, oh yeah, they all seem to right their menu down on chalkboards I found...almost like a bar on steroids if you will.  To support my claim, I had the mac and cheese Philly sandwich to go along with a   Sierra Nevada Kellerweis Hefe while my then fiance had the chicken and waffles sandwich (the unicorn I think it was called??) to go with some type of old fashioned cocktail.  I wasn't crazy about the food, but they get a good grade for effort I suppose.    What I find most appealing about Park is that it is part of the whole \"Hsieh Downtown Revival Movement.\"  It offers a new dimension to this growing artsy district, each establishment complimenting one another.  I draw the line right at LVB, everything West of that street is ol' school downtown casinos and bars, while everything East of that street is everything else I am all about.    Park is well positioned and if I had to map my map of attack on a nightly basis, it would most likely start with a Sazerac at Downtown Cocktail Lounge, then Park for a beer and a snack (cushion), jump into either the Grif for a goblet of Delerium or Insert Coins (granted they ain't tryna be stingy at the line), slide through to Beauty Bar to get some fat shots then have a contest of some sort to see who will stand in line at the Commonwealth while the rest of the gang stays refreshed at the Vanguard.  Yep, that's a well planned strategy if I must say so myself.  So again, Park plays an intricate role in the inner workings of the downtown scene and provides a different flavor amongst the many the area has to offer.  Had the food been better, I could see myself giving a higher rating, but overall not a bad spot at all.",

    "text": "The name says it all. It amazing too think the creativity people can come up with in the  restaurant business. Think that Park on Fremont literally empty parking lot before this transformation too cool little pub in the ever growing downtown scene. One that more more little cool bars and restaurants really DIGGING the vibe. I think Park on Fremont is another solid addition.   I came with fellow yelpers Mel C, Terri R, Alicia R, Toni R, and Merrick. One thing hopefully they do is get some kind of signage on the exterior because if not for yelp (looked at all of yelpers helpful pics) walked right pass it. It located right next too Radio City Pizza. Some in ways its different without sign and peeks one interest see what on the inside. We never sat on the inside but enjoyed the patio and the amazing weather that night. The patio not that big but just great spot not only for people watching, just kicking back with friends, and not too loud they do play music over the speakers. (in general hear music coming from other bars or even freemont street experience) Still can carry conversations with friends without shouting too one another. They even have beer garden but never venture check it out next tip will. The menu comes too the food not that big but they do offer quite few different beers for such small bar. Although seems that night for some of our party it more like okay out of that too.   It was only the second night they open too the public so hiccups or just working things out are too be expected. I am not going too be harsh comes too the service. Just felt it was good service even with some hiccups they did great job of taking care of us. Park on Fremont really nice compare too some of the other bars in downtown the bar offers food! It not that big (by the way no Grilled Cheese; it caught my attention for not) but few things is solid options. I decided too have the Hammer Chicken. It not what I expected but suppose in thought Hammer (pounded the chicken thin) not so much sandwich but light chicken salad. Good. The mixed organic greens with balsamic vinegar with blue cheese, toasted walnut or candied walnuts, combine with the chicken went perfect with my Dr Brown orange soda. Everyone else ordered something different but everything looked great. Fan of the wooden utensils and plates. It different goes with the whole flow of the restaurant. For me it does.  One more feature about the patio with the white picket fences goes around. Fan. It feels like out in midwest kicking back on front porch on great weather day. Hanging out with great company. Great company pleasure of first trip too Park on Fremont and sure not be my last!!!",

Nothing special but we were not here to chit chat. Brought beer, brought food, brought check. We saw her three times.   The people watching aspect has me hooked :)))) if it was not sooo chilly and windy tonight we would have stayed for another drink!   Hubby ordered the veggie sliders and sweet potato tots. Yum! The pickles on them...ugh I could eat a million. Nothing dry about these burgers. Moist and tasteful. They came with a side of some kind of homemade honey mustard. Tots were too sweet for me but they were yum.  I ordered the veggie pita wrap. Nothing wrap about it. It's a soft, warm stuffed pita. Inside it had eggplant, yellow squash, a tiny bit of smooth spread feta, lettuce and tomato. It comes with crispy hand it fries. Crispy! Ugh I love crispy fries! I don't like catsup but I decided to try it anyway...HELLO?!? It has siracha in it!!!!! Yum I'm sold and will never be the same!   See my pics for the beauty!  I want to go back to visit the inside, lol we did not even walk in the place!  Great job Park! Put my name on that table! I want to people watch there everyday!   Perfection!",

With whimsical artwork and wallpaper, chandeliers, and an outdoor garden patio, I can see this place as a regular haunt for some folks as it does take you out of the Vegas mindset.  I was disappointed in the presentation of our drinks on my (first) outing here. Our cocktails and water were served in those cheap plastic cups, not the mason jars that I've seen in pictures and reviews. Do they only roll them out at a certain time or for certain people? The drinks themselves were not bad. We also had some overpriced-for-the-portion chips and salsa  Could use some better service. My drink did not come out with everyone else's. Thinking that the bartender was backed up, I waited. After my companions were 70% finished with their drinks, I asked our server to check. 5 minutes later she comes back with it, no explanation why my drink took so long. Also, our water was not refilled, despite seeing our server go around with a pitcher every so often. Not good in my eyes, as during my server days, I was taught to always offer/keep water filled when people are drinking for a long period.",

    "text": "So.... I sort of love this bar. The vintage hipster meets whimsical Alice in Wonderland atmosphere is what attracts me here and on top of that they have delicious drinks!   Looking at their menu, they had such unique and fun names for the drinks such as \"The Bored and the Beautiful\". I ordered the \"Hunting Season\" which sounded like a heavenly mango bloody mary but unfortunately since mangos were not in season, they had to change up the drink a little bit but it was still yummy. The drink I'll always remember is their GRAPEFRUIT BEER! If you love fruity drinks, you MUST get this. I could drink this all day and everyday... if my asian glow/ allergies would allow me to :(  I probably spent half my time here being mesmerized by all the unique decor. I love the quote above the bar, the chandeliers hanging in the hallway, the beautiful outdoor patio with vintage hanging plates and the hidden smoking area with a TEETER TOTTER! I hadn't been on a teeter totter since I was like 4 so I was definitely a little too excited and a little too intoxicated which led to a very painful memory so beware haha. They clearly put a lot of attention to detail in their decor and it's definitely eye catching and distracting!  There is also an eccentric twist to their vintage decor which was a little creepy for me.... there were one too many pictures of voodoo-ish girl dolls in the bathroom and some lightly morbid decor like the stuffed birds around the bar area that were a little too much for me. I will admit that I was scared that Nancy S. and I were scared to go to the bathroom alone LOL. Maybe it was me and my paranoia but I just felt a slightly haunted vibe going on there.   Despite the creepy things that bothered me a little bit about this place, I would definitely be back for their drinks and cool vibe. If I lived in Vegas, I feel like I would be a regular here.  Ps. Watch out for the little gnome. He's known for stealing phones :P",

Right across from the Fremont experience downtown, Park is perfect for people watching! You will see people of all walks of life doing all kinds d things. You will not get bored... Promise.   This place is all about the cocktails. I'm talking straight up mixology. The first few times I went and read their cocktail list k thought they were crazy with some of their concoctions...but that is why they're the experts and I'm not. Although they sound like crazy mixtures, their drinks are some of the most delicious drinks I've had here in town.  If you go, the pillow talk is the most refreshing and amazing drink I've had-ever.   This place is also ultra trendy. You and your friends trying to find someplace new to try that's cool and hip? Suggest this place and your group won't be disappointed. From the second you walk in you know your entering a cool place as the staff is dressed in flannels. Flannels are always a good sign. The decor adds to the cool, unique, and trendy vibe you get. Everything is super bizarre but put together in a way that works.   If weather permits, I really recommend sitting out on the back patio. Really cool seating and great vibes out there. Also, if you can pull yourself away from your party for long enough there is a \"secret\" seesaw behind the wall with the fireplace in it. Always get good laughs when you take a ride on that thing.   Like I said, this place is all about the scene and the cocktails. That is why they get 4 stars and not 5. Although it's a great place and I will definitely be going back time and time again.... Their food, to me, is just good. Which isn't a bad thing, but I also don't think it's 5 star worthy. Also, their service can be pretty slow. I've only ever had one server there that took care of us at a good rate. Otherwise, I've always been left waiting. Trying to flag down my server to speed the process along. Other than this, though, Park is the place to be! Recommend it.. You won't regret it.",

As much as I love LV, I am always ecstatic when I find a new spot that makes me feel like I am in a different city. (Makes total sense, right?)  Came here for lunch during the soft opening.  Place was bumping at noon, but the hostess staff was very friendly and accommodating and found us a table in 10 minutes flat.  The beer list here is crazy long and has a lot of unique offerings.  Here's what we ordered for lunch: Chicken Bites (5 stars! Awesome) Drunken chicken (4 stars and how awesome that there is an option for those watching their calories) Reuben (3 stars - this was some seriously briney corned beef.  Too much for me)  I agree with the assessment of fellow yelpers.  This is elevated bar food.  I did not expect much and was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed the grub.  You don't go here for the food though.  You go for the experience.  With that philosophy in mind, I returned on Saturday night to get the bar experience and try out that beer list (mmm banana bread beer).  This place is gorgeous.  Beautiful reclaimed wood, open-air bar, super chic interior and a patio and beer garden that are unbelievably cute.  The guys behind this joint (as well as Commonwealth) have truly outdone themselves with their attention to the details.  Amazing.

We ordered the stuffed burger and the mac n cheese topped philly.  HOLY MOLY is all I have to say.  The mac n cheese topped philly cheese steak sandwich is the  most amazing thing I've ever eaten in the last week!  Okay, okay, more like the last month.  Seriously.  The mac n cheese was perfectly cooked with a cheesy buttery taste, and it perfectly complimented the salty tender beef.  The bread was perfectly toasted and not at all soggy like some philly's tend to get.  My biggest regret of the day was waiting until I was too bombed to fully recall the experience of tasting this masterpiece in my mouth.  The service was also fast.  They weren't that busy so we never had to wait to order anything.  The food came really quickly too.  I can't wait to go back and eat that philly cheese steak again.  Oh yeah!

We sat outside in the patio area and we were quickly greeted with friendly service.  Ordering was difficult due to so many yummy sounding and unique options on the menu!   We started with mimosas  which included a whole bottle of champagne and a carafe of orange juice for us to mix and match ourselves. I LOVE this option!  Next we opted for the chicken and waffle sandwich with bacon with a salad and a side of tator tots and of course, my husband couldn't resist ordering the thick cut bacon!  The chicken and waffle sandwhich was perfection that included a crispy brown waffle coated in powdered sugar with crunchy and juicy fried chickend and thinly sliced bacon served with maple syrup. The tator tots were an added bonus although nothing over the top special.  Aaaaand the BACON. YUM!",

    "text": "Visiting from out of town, I found this place online, and saw they had my favorite Monte Cristo on their weekend-only brunch menu.  Craving this rare sloppy heap of goodness, I ventured over. The interior is spacious and clean, with a cool array of art and collectibles to look at.  The outdoor seating area is far more popular, but I prefer indoors.  Based on this one visit, that's the best thing I can say about POF, aside from the friendly, efficient service.  The Monte Cristo was a hearty sandwich with generous ham and cheese between 2 grilled bread slices.  But it had absolutely NO flavor-  it wasn't cheesy, hammy, nor french toasty.  It only tasted like the grill it was cooked on.  If they had remembered to put powdered sugar on it the way the menu described, it might have been a bit tastier.  But it just went down without registering anything savory, sweet or otherwise.    It's hard to find a Monte Cristo, so kudos to them for providing one.  It does silence the hunger for sure, but tastewise it was lacking.  So for now, it's Cheesecake Factory on Sundays for a decent Monte Cristo.  If I return to POF, I will simply try something else.",

The sweet tots were good. I liked how it was a bit crispy. The chicken and waffle was okay. I ended up eating them separately instead of a sandwich. The waffle was good. It was fluffy and had the right amount of crisp. The chicken was okay. The chicken was sort of dry and it wasn't as crispy as I would have liked it to be.  They have a good selection of drinks. Pretty reasonable. I tried the Pillow Talk cocktail. It was sweet and refreshing.  The servers were really nice and attentive. Absolutely no problems with them.   I definitely would recommend this place.",

The outdoor patio was full and so we decided to eat inside. We were seated at a comfortable corner booth. Our server arrived and initially not a real warmth to her personality but she grew nicer as the evening progressed. Sometimes I wonder what ever happened to quality customer service??!! The restaurant itself has some unusual and cool art hanging on the walls. There is wallpaper on the ceiling too which gave the interior character.  Anyway I had read they offer a nice selection of microbrewed beer and my husband and I both ordered a pint of Moose Drool. Well, a couple minutes later our server came back to inform us that they were out of that beer. We then ordered two Alleycat Amber Ales I always wonder how restaurants run out of a certain beer. Shouldn't they order enough? Here is the food breakdown:  Mac N Cheese/Phillysteak sandwich - a recommended dish and my friends enjoyed it. It was moist and the meat was tender. The Mac and cheese was a nice touch and added flavor.  Fish Tacos - my choice. These were really spicy with chipotle mayo, cilantro, cabbage and fish. The fish was crunchy, light and fluffy. I give these 5 stars on their own!  Steak Tacos - my husband had these and I had a couple bites. Super basic tacos with very little flavor. The meat tasted like rubber and was very  over cooked. Probably the worst choice on the menu.  Will I go back? I probably would just to sit outside on the cool back patio and to eat a couple more fish tacos!",

We went on a Saturday around 2 and they only had brunch while we were there, which serves a limited menu, so we just ordered some appetizers and drinks, but wished they had more food options available. Loved that my beer was served in a mason jar- so cute! Decent service.",

Drinks came out right away. 3/6 got there food 45 min after ordering and the other 3 got ours after over an hour wait. I had to get up and ask someone what was taking so long because only half the table got to eat. Food was served cold. Ordered the fries with the egg on top and they had been sitting so long the egg yolk was solid.   Location is great for people watching if you sit outside since it's right on the corner. They have heat lamps which helped because it got chilly.  Staff was nice. Decent happy hour prices and menu. Just super slow service and I didn't care for the cold food at all.",

I've only eaten brunch there and enjoyed both the Country Breakfast Burrito and the Monte Cristo. For alcohol I definitely recommend the refreshing Twisted Grapefruit (pictured) which is a drink made and served in a fresh grapefruit with a straw. The decor of the place is very hipster. And in True hipster spirit, they have a bike rack. Caution, the bike rack is more trendy than practical. I should have taken a picture of it, it's basically a ring in the ground, so if you don't have a long cable to loop through your bike you'll have a hard time locking it all down. Fun place though, I frequent it often.",

Definitely ask to sit in the back garden outdoor area.  It's super cute with string lights, random paintings/artwork, and a cinderella carriage on the roof !!! (which was what caught my attention the most).  Drinks: We ordered two of their moscow mules: the twig& berries and the Tennesse Stud.  I felt both were pretty good .  Food: Definitely ORDER the garbage fries over tots! SOOO delicious . It's a wonderful mix of EGG, jalapenos, cheese, bacon, avocado, tomatoes, and perfectly crispy tots. My boyfriend and I finished off every last bite of this dish.  Old School Park Sandwich was just okay .  It's supposed to be brisket and pastrami but I felt like all I could taste was pastrami.  The bread was also very chewy.  However, it came with a choice of fries, tots, or a side salad and we opted for sweet potato tots (pretty original!) and that was tasty.  Steak Tacos: I'm not a huge taco fan but it did not taste as amazing as it looked.   Our total bill with tax and tip was $70 .  Overall , very reasonable and I would definitely come again for those garbage fries and drinks!",

There's even a seesaw in a mini playground behind the garden walls (haven't been on one of those in forever).   Our server was very attentive and helpful in explaining the menu, although a lot of items were pretty standard. I ordered the steak and egg skillet. My steak was overcooked past medium rare, but had good flavor from the chimichurri sauce. My sunny side up eggs, on the other hand, was a tad undercooked, as you can see in the egg whites in my photo. The potatoes were soggy, since there was an odd wet layer at the bottom of the skillet.  We also shared an order of the samurai tater tots. These were bomb. Super original by adding soy, sriracha, and nori. Would come back for these, and maybe their dinner menu next time.",

I suggest sitting in the back patio (21+) to enjoy the cool art and quirky styling.  Our server was nice, friendly and answered all questions. We have a hard time choosing food sometimes and she provided suggestions. We went with the breakfast chilaquiles and the classic double cheeseburger w waffle fries. The chilaquiles were tasty but nowhere near a traditional Mexican chilaquiles recipe. The sauce was a little more mild than I would like. There was lots of chicken and even some egg sprinkled on top along with cheese. They are served nacho style as well, which is not traditional.  The burger was, in my opinion, wayyy better than the chilaquiles. The meat was flavorful and not dry, lots of tasty cheese. And the fries! Get the seasoned waffle fries!! I'd return here. Not your typical restaurant ambiance which makes it so great! The food was also good! The drinks look sooo good as well. Great location right next to Fremont st.",

Amongst us we tried the turkey bacon avo-philly sandwich, the stoner (pastrami) sandwich, the classic double cheeseburger, garbage fries, a side salad, and tater tots. The turkey and stoner sandwiches were very good. The cheeseburger was also good, but in an average way. The garbage fries were filled with various toppings and tasted great. I also had two amazing cocktails; the pillow talk and the flower power. The service was slow even though there were only a few others in the restaurant. The Park has a good simplified menu and it's location making it a solid restaurant when hanging out downtown.",

After spending a day on the Strip, we were looking for something a little bit more low key, so we decided to go happy hour hopping on Fremont Street. Unfortunately, we had already eaten at a few places before we made it to Park, so we didn't get any food here. However, the drinks and atmosphere were really great.  Upon walking into the bar, we were greeted by the bartender who was very friendly and told us we could grab a seat anywhere. A few seconds later a server came to take our orders. Park has some really great happy hour deals. We each ordered vodka sodas which were only $3 each. Living in the Bay Area for the past 5+ years, it has been a long time since I've been to a nice place with drink prices this low. Many of the food items on the happy hour menu looked enticing but we were still really full from lunch.  After finishing our drinks, we walked around the bar and the back patio and admired the artwork. I liked that they went with bold style choices and weren't afraid to be a little outlandish.   Overall, this was a cool bar with great service. Next time we are in Vegas, we will definitely return to Park on Fremont.",

When we got there, it was a bit later in the night and the hostess said the patio was closed. But since we were so looking forward to it, she checked with her manager and let us go out back anyway!   Maybe it helped that we were a few drinks in, but we had an incredible time here. The server we had was so lovely as well. She was so helpful with telling us the hotspots in town, and really nice to talk to. I promised her I'd mention her on yelp - huge shout out to Jennifer! I hope that's her name, it's been a while... Anyway she was awesome.  Food was modern takes on usual pub food. Exactly the stuff we want to eat while drinking. Drinks were great too. We will be back next time!",

We came as a group of out-of-towners and one Vegas transplant an shad a great time. We had a table in the back and the patio is awesome. The decor is eclectic and some is just plain weird but also hilarious and unique. I had the Unicorn beverage and it was delicious - I drank it too fast so maybe there was a lot of ice, but I enjoyed it either way and it was fairly priced for a craft cocktail in Downtown Las Vegas. We ordered the giant mules after each having an individual cocktail - 2 for the table and while I'm sure it's mostly ice making then overpriced, it was fun and different and they were honestly delicious. I'd definitely say it's worth the trip to Fremont Street to check out Park on Fremont perhaps after a stroll down Fremont Street Old Las Vegas.",

Offered a reservation for us since my sister forgot her ID and we were standing around waiting for my friend to bring it to us. Food was ok, wish there was more selection and our server was not very attentive, we were also brought luke warm water, and glasses of ice. Ice was never refilled, it's 100 degree weather outside and he didn't really check on our party often.  My cocktail that I ordered when we sat down was lost and ended up coming super late.  I understand the bar is busy on First Friday, but people in my party that ordered a lot later had their drinks already.",

Inside was equally hot as the outside just not in the sun. Questionable as to whether there was any AC going. Hopefully this was an extremely eco friendly conscious decision by the owner. If so, approved! If not, come on!  Ordered a caesar salad and a burger. Burger came with two patties. My friend requested just one. Was told it wasn't an option. Really?! Just cook one less patty. Surely that saves you time and money. Really? Food had incredibly poor presentation and taste. I know a caesar salad doesn't need to be beautiful, but I've seen better. Crap, I've even MADE better. It was quite soggy as well.   Sigh.  Did I talk to a manager? No. Because...where to start. If i need to tell your staff it's saving YOU time and money to make one less patty, it's not even worth voicing an opinion. We left with a patty still on the plate. What a waste. Sorry, cow.",

Everything else that we got was pretty good. We ordered Mac and cheese bites, the Philly cheese steak, and tacos.  The cheese bites were good but not as good as the Cheesecake Factory's Mac and cheese bites. The portions for the tacos were tiny. They were the three tiniest tacos I've ever seen. But, the porion for the cheese steak was fairly large. I ended up giving my boyfriend half of my cheese steak since the tacos were so small. He really liked the cheese steak. I thought it was good but I didn't like the bread it was on. Too hard.",

My wife got the avocado turkey club and it was her favorite club but it wasn't life changing or anything.  She got tots tho and you can't go wrong with that.  It was a nice attempt at the food, we are from San Diego and just used to different variations of said dishes.  It's a little out there with ambience they have abstracts and weird paintings on the walls, the bathroom is creepy I can imagine you being drunk taking a piss and getting weirded out hard lol probably what it's there for.  I did notice a shakedown street lyric near the bar I thought it was a nice touch.  Overall the food is nearly quite there, the service is just right, and the ambience is a little extra.",

    "text": "The hub and I were looking for a low-key place to grab brunch when we were in Vegas over the holiday weekend. We were staying on The Strip (at Vdara), but the breakfast places in the upscale hotels tend to be overpriced and underwhelming.  An Instagram friend of mine who lives in LV suggested we go somewhat off the beaten path and that's just what we did.  To be clear, it's not too remote, as it's just a short walk over to the \"old\"/downtown Vegas area.   The highlight of this place is definitely the charming, somewhat quirky back yard, which is where we chose to be seated so we could eat el fresco and soak up some rays.  There are trees back there, so shady areas are available too.  We got there too early for the brunch menu, so we ordered from the more limited breakfast menu.  The pricing is relatively reasonable with prices ranging from $8 (for a breakfast sandwich) to $13 (for avocado toast).  While we were tempted by the lemon ricotta pancakes, both of us ended up ordering the breakfast burrito which was delicious, a perfect combo of protein and carbs to sustain us for a busy day of sight-seeing ahead.   As we got there before the brunch rush started, it was quiet and relaxing.  Our waitress was lovely too.  If we find ourselves in Vegas again, we'd likely try the brunch here.",

I could go for those waffles every day and I'm not usually a fan of waffles ( tried it due to other reviews on it). My girlfriend got wings and she hasn't shit up about how much she loved them since lol. The atmosphere was amazing and the decor was lovely. I can't wait to go back and given we are locals it will sure be soon.",

First off Fremont street is great already, so much more intimate and less walking than the strip. This was basically in the heart of it.   I made reservations earlier in the day for a group of about 7. When we got there my mother in law was having a tricky time with the high top table but they were so sweet to move us to a lower table really quickly. Luckily it wasn't too busy at the time.   I had a warm coffee cocktail (Girl Scout something) sweet, probably better for dessert but so delicious! I was between two sandwiches and our server recommended the freebird (I think was the name) and it was to die for! My mouth waters just thinking about it! Everyone else loved their food as well.   Also super reasonable prices especially for vegas! Go check it out!",

    "text": "Monday morning and where to eat? After some yelp searching I settled on park on Fremont.  We arrived to find a very eclectic place with lots of interesting decor. You'll see a fair amount of taxidermy and paintings that look like oddities. The floor is a herringbone wood floor that looks amazing and old possibly reclaimed, I'm not sure.  It was open seating so we picked a booth and were met with a very friendly upbeat enthusiastic waitress.  It was very evident she loves her job.  We ordered drinks and ordered cold brew coffee and were told it's bottled but good. We agree it's good but a suggestion would be to make your own cold brew coffee, that would have been perfect! Food wise we got the Avocado toast and French toast.   The Avocado toast was on point and couldn't get any better however it was outshined by the French toast.  Seriously just get the French toast and thank me later.  It's sweet with strawberry and powdered sugar. It came with maple syrup but guess what? We didn't touch the syrup is that good. Visiting from Portland, OR I can say this place would be a hit here and I recommend this place to anyone who visits Vegas.",

Literally one of the coolest interiors to a bar I've been to and the specialty drinks are great. One of our favorite Moscow mules. Additionally, they have a variety of mules to choose from. My sole criticism is that when last I was there they don't carry Sailor Jerry rum and they stopped carrying Jameson Caskmates. Definitely a great local hang out and solid food selections as well.",

That was a little weird.  We are outside and our daughter had the deep fried mac and cheese.  Unfortunately it was very dry inside and really needed the sauces they provided (hot sauce and cheese sauce).  I had a brisket sandwich that was actually quite good.  The bread was crusty and warm.  The brisket was seasoned well. We didn't check the menu and assumed it came with a side (which it didn't).  There was one other table occupied while we were eating and the service could not have been slower.  The person who served us never did come back to our table and we waited 15 minutes for the bill.  A very unusual experience.  We love Fremont but unfortunately this place just wasn't up to th task.",

The actual building itself is very fun and the outside seating is really cute, though we dined inside because of the heat. The first issue was there was a hair in my boyfriends drink, like wrapped all in the ice and around the cup. They made a new one and it was fine after that. The second issue was I had ordered no onions on my sandwich, it came with onions on it anyways. I told our server and she took it back so they could take them off, but I could still taste the pickled onion taste anyways. =\\ The staff was friendly but I doubt we will be back again. Just was disappointing because I had higher expectations.",

The patio almost made me feel like I was not in Vegas, but somewhere more tropical, specially with the nice breeze the weather gave us.   They have a very small selection of food. I tried their monte cristo. The food itself tasted not so bad, but it would have definitely been better if they did not burn the bottom part of the toast too much. They tried hiding it but we could still taste it. The fruits that came along with them were really tasty though.  The service was very friendly, but it was slow. It took them too long to bring out our drinks and to even take our orders. However, it is a spot that we would go back and have a nice-breezy brunch.",

There are a lot of cool bars downtown but the problem is they don't serve food! You can get a slice at Uncle Joe's but it's much more practical to serve food and alcohol at the same location. Kudos to the owners on the decoration, it is really fab. And the outdoor seating is great; you need to get here asap before it gets too hot. Also, it's great that they open at 11:00; bars in big cities are open early, sometimes a beer at noon is what you need.  My husband and I dropped in literally when it opened at 11:00 and were promptly seated outdoors, the weather was beautiful! We looked over the beer menu; they have a good selection, although it tends to be pretty mainstream. The hubby ordered an IPA that came in a mason jar and I got a can of a beer called Moose Drool. It was awesome, I felt very manly drinking it. Ron Swanson would definitely approve. The ccktail menu didn't really appeal to me, I think this place is best suited for a beer, or five.",

Having just eaten at Le Thai, we stopped in for some cocktails and the hostess told us to seat ourselves in the outdoor area to the side of the building.  OK, not a particularly enchanting environment, but it was a beautiful day.  I propelled myself into a optimistic urban renewal mindset and the cocktail and beer menus looked encouraging, though I was a tad miffed that the beer menu was vague in description and had no prices.  Even after pondering those menus for over 15 minutes, many of the items still appeared like something we might want to sample if only someone would come by to take our order.  Where's Godot?  Apparently not on that side of Park on Fremont.  So there we are, dying on the vine, but still with enough hope and vitality to get up and walk inside and then back out to the garden in the back rather than just walk out (which was an option we tossed around) and then tad-dah....a little quixotic haven came into sight .  The ambiance: think Alice in Wonderland on acid with her own show on HGTV.  Flowers, statues,  vintage plates, metal furniture, picture of horses copulating, freakish wallpaper; totally awesome!  The service:  thank you Andera for listening to us bemoan our previous shunning, for finding out the answers to all our questions, and for turning the whole service experience around to make it that awesome as well!  Libations: Trophy Wife and Olde English 800.  The Trophy Wife was delish and the  24 oz of the succulent ghetto juice of my college days was not only nostalgic, but yummy in it's paper bag sort of way.",

But unfortunately, the food and cocktails are just mediocre and the service is awful. It takes forever to get your server to pay attention to you, and when they do, they're rude.   The last time I was there, I was with a table of 8 and we were the only people in the place. After waiting 20 minutes for the cocktails we ordered, we walked inside to the bar and picked them up ourselves. Our waitress NEVER came back to our table. We intended to order food too, but ended up just paying the bartender and leaving.",

    "text": "I don't believe I've seen so much vegetation in an establishment in this city since the last time I went to Home Depot and wandered into their gardening center. I loved the vibe right off the bat, especially when my girlfriends and I were led to the back garden. It was so refreshing to see trees that were not cactus, as if you really were in a \"park on Fremont\"!   Our server Liza was very friendly and it was with her that I finally fulfilled a childhood dream when I ordered a cocktail and said, \"I will have the Unicorn, please,\" \"the Unicorn\" being a ginger beer & vodka cocktail - pretty much two of my favorite beverages in a glass. Liza was attentive and on top of the ball the whole night, so props to her! We were three of those girls boys hate to take out and all ordered salad - two of us got strawberry balsamic salads and the other ordered the steak salad. The greens were crisp - not limp at all, while the bleu cheese crumbles were not too overpowering, the portions of chicken were generous, the candied walnuts were crunchy, and the strawberries gave it just the right amount of a sweet kick.   The food hadn't even hit the table when we noticed a sewage stench near our seats against the wall that separates Park (is it okay if I just call you that?) with Radio City Pizza. We tried to do our best and give Park the benefit of the doubt, knowing that this is probably out of the restaurant's control, but then it also became noticeable that the music was TOO loud. I was in the middle of yelling about the onset of my quarter-life crisis to my friends when of course the Kings of Leon song in the back ended right as I was shouting, \"AND I HAVE NO IDEA WHAT I'M DOING WITH MY LIFE!\" Great. I might as well have just megaphoned this news to the whole restaurant.   Until the noise is controlled in the back (is it like that in the front too?) I probably won't think too much about grabbing a bite there, but otherwise this could be a great place to post up for a beverage - the generous pours into mason jars means I made the right decision to have skipped the Strip to imbibe more for less.",

    "text": "What I thought would be an amazing experience for happy hour turned into a rather mediocre dining experience complete with garbage truck/sewage smell. The entire experience was pretty much ruined by this and had I known the stench would continually waft over our party while we ate I definitely would have chosen a seat outside.  But ah! The name is \"Park\" on Fremont, and the incredibly tack-full back patio is what this place is also about of course! Unless you are attempting to eat while foul sewage is creeping into your nostrils. Unfortunately this aspect is one I flatly refuse to lure myself into again. If I go back to Park on Fremont I will sit at the bar and leave the stinky patio be.  Food - Veggie Sliders of BORINGNESS. First off the sliders have the right idea, fresh enough veggies, interesting combo, but there was ZERO taste. It was bland, bland, bland and it came with NO sauce. No sauce at all. Um, not even like some veganaise? I'm not a vegetarian, but these sounded/looked yummy. They need seasoning. Please, for the love of all the is good - season the food!  Drink - Drink menu is pretty darn cool. Beer selection is cool. Although I was brought out the *other* raspberry beer that was in stock, rather than the one I actually requested. None the less - delicious. And at $10, I thought yikes! But when I saw it was a Pint I knew I would not even need another drink. My friend had one of their Bloody Mary's, which I tasted and it was yummy. Mixed very well. I would go back to have one in the future.  Service - Eh. Although our waitress was nice our drinks took a decade to arrive. Although she said she was \"waiting on the bar\" a few times to us - I can't imagine what the crap the bar was doing - basically, not making our drinks. It was not busy.   Ambiance - Again, sewage smell. Also, to begin with we were sat in the front of the restaurant on Fremont street and I wasn't thrilled. With the cars going by it just was not a nice place to dine. The inside was interesting, but the bar looked somewhat small.   Return Factor - I am turned off from their food, but I am intrigued with the drink menu and the drinks are what got the extra star for this review, or else it would have been a 2-star. I believe I will be back for drinks and I'll sit at the bar for sure.",

The waitress with the new bolt-ons was energetic and nice.   DO NOT EAT HERE and don't order any beverage other than a pre-made one (beers, Cokes, etc.). You will be disappointed, I promise you!   I ordered chicken and waffles. I expected bar food, based upon the menu. What I received was an old, freezer-burned toaster waffle that was microwaved with tough chicken tenders that were breaded years ago in Arkansas at the cheesy Tyson plant (and that is a compliment, trust me).  Yup, really poor excuse is you like this type of meal.   Margueritas are one shot of bad Tequila and 16 oz. of lemonade in a Mason jar. Looks delicious but the result is poorly executed sweetness with absolutely no similarity to a margarita. Oh, they charge $9 for this lemonade, too!   This was my first visit to the Fremont Street area. Never again!!",

The only person that could have heard us was your out of line bartender. #2 that my comments were disparaging towards LGBT.  Absolute lie! My comments were about why LGBT community continues to defend muslims when muslims would throw you/them off buildings. If that offends then you need to learn about logic. Stop with the cry baby nonsense and stop creating lies to justify the bad treatment I received. I'm wondering if Park at Fremont is part of the militant gay community and is all about shaming rather than open conversation.  I really feel for the poor innocent people at the Florida club who were massacred by a True LGBT hater last night. I'm curious if your bartender would stand up against the Muslim who killed these innocent people or only the harmless guy having a drink at your bar conversing with a friend? #realcourage",

    "text": "The food and service have been pretty good on my first 2 visits here. I was sorely disappointed last night. If you want abuse and poor service this is your place.   After we were seated by the hostess  for about 5 minutes another person came and politely told us that the table had been reserved for a large party and that we could sit outside or squeeze in at the bar.   I ordered Mac Balls and Fish Tacos at the bar.  A server came out fast with two plates including Garbage Fries. I let him know that it must have been someone else's order. That's when the fight started. The bartender told me \"you ordered Mac and Cheese Balls and Garbage Fries\". When I let him know what I truly ordered he replied with \"no.  You said ......\"  He was visibly agitated. I stopped talking.  After some hemming and hawing the bartender said something like \" I guess I can put in a new order for Fish Tacos\". I asked him not to bother.   I paid for the Mac and cheese and left. For good. The customer is not always right but this bartender won the argument and lost the customer. This restaurant must have all the business that they need to fire customers like this. Happy holidays.",

I had the Francknerwizzunsumpthing Heff-- I actually dont remember what its name was but I had two of them and these were among the best beers I had during the entire stay in Vegas. My main dinner course was a sandwich called \"Philly Mac and Cheesesteak\". This was INCREDIBLE!!!! The ambience is totally there. They even have a teeter-totter (see-saw) there for no reason except to have fun. I would absolutely return here.",

The hostesses at the front indicated there was absolutely no availability, and that all the tables were reserved.  She indicated I could come back at a reserved time. We came back 45 minutes later. When we re-arrived, shocking, it was still fairly empty with plenty of availability.  The first table offered to us was partially directly in the sun.  After some haggling, the hostess reluctantly offered us an inside table.  If you can get passed the initial lack of hostess service, you will enjoy yourself.  The food was great!! The drinks were even better!!!  The ambiance is unique eclectic; loved it! 3 stars because we almost walked away due to the feeling that we were not welcomed.  Once settles in we had a good time.",

Although there are breakfast spots I know are fantastic in Vegas, Park was just a short walk from my hotel and my time was limited. I sat at the bar and ordered the Monte Cristo. First, it took FOREVER for my \"food\" to come out. The bartender noticed that I had been waiting 15+ minutes for a sandwich and nudged someone to find out what was going on with my order. When it finally came out.. It. Was. Terrible. It was dry and kind of burnt. The turkey on the inside was extremely dry. The taste overall made me a bit nauseous - it was that bad. Rather than order a new one (and wait another 15-20 minutes) I simply paid and left my unfinished sandwich.   I know this place has a ton of good reviews but I'd recommend you stay far away - at least for breakfast/brunch.",

They have a somewhat limited breakfast menu, but interesting toast flavors and combinations. Service was slow, albeit there were only 3 seated tables including us and a half full bar. We had two servers, actually one, but he never checked on us, so we had to keep raising our hand to the back bar for attention, service and another server for water or drinks or to correct our order. I got the buratta toast with fig jam and almonds - delicious. Hubs got the turkey sausage sandwich, scrambled eggs instead of the over. After, I swear, 15 minutes he brings a bacon breakfast sandwich - wrong order. So I notice they don't write any of the orders down....he doesn't even check the order before setting down the wrong dish...so 10 minutes go by, trying to wave down the server who's hanging at the bar and kitchen. Do another 15\" goes by to remake the wrong order - hey note to Park on Fremont....have your serves write down orders, maybe they'll get them right. So it takes 15 minutes to request and get the check, the few parties at the bar told us to dine and dash...they were serious, as they too were waiting a long time for service and the bill. I counted at least 5-6 servers in this small place, why the crazy slow service???  Improve the service before I ever come back",

I love the wallpaper and the beautiful antique chandeliers hanging in the hallway on the way to a mystic patio.  I seriously couldn't stop taking pictures of the outside.  It was sooooo cool.  Flowers, succulents, antiques, awesome pictures and artwork.  The menu was simple, and easy to look at.  I ordered the french toast casserole and it was great!  The fries are really fresh and delicious as well.  The service was wonderful.  It was not too busy at all for a Sunday brunch.  Get there to bet the heat early and sit on the patio.  A MUST!!",

    "text": "I came to Park on Fremont specifically for Taco Tuesday, where $2 street tacos and $1 Dos Equis are the flavor of the day. The hostess convinced us to eat at the outdoor patio right next to a space heater since indoor seating was full. Too bad the space heater died out about 10 minutes after we sat down. Woman! Don't promise me heat, only to leave me in the bitter cold moments after I get comfortable at my table! The table next to us requested the heater be turned back on all but 3 times. The runner was in charge of this duty, but was struggling to keep up with Taco Tuesday night. He eventually got to the heater, but we were finishing up our meals by the time we were warm and toasty again.   $2 STREET TACOS: My husband said the tacos were \"perfect\". The tacos were topped with guacamole, salsa, and sour cream. I asked if they could make vegetarian tacos, but no such luck. :(    GARBAGE FRIES ($5 during Happy Hour): The fries were good until they weren't. Have you ever ate something that started out good, but then blew out by the end of the meal? That's what happened to me.   $1 DOS EQUIS: These bottles are cute. They're practically made for infants. I laughed out loud when I poured a bottle into the plastic cup the restaurant provided - it barely filled a quarter of the cup! I say, False Advertisement! They should have \"Tiny\" written in next to their $1 Dos Equis menu.   SERVICE: The waitress and the runner were doing their best to keep up. My husband got his street tacos before we received our beers. There seemed to be a lot of confusion on which tables ordered what. Maybe it's because we were sitting outside?   ATMOSPHERE: There was a combination of younger and older people here. Our table on the patio was tucked away behind some greenery, so we were afforded some privacy. The music was decent, until it cut off into awkward silence. Turn the music back on peeps!   Return Visit? Yes, but not on Taco Tuesday. Their selection for vegetarians is quite small, but I'd like to try their Veggie burger ($10) next time. If the veggie burger fails me, then nope, not coming back.  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2015: #13",

    "text": "It turns out we were confused about the type of establishment this place is because we saw it on a Food Channel TV show. After making reservations for dinner and going there it  became clear that Park on Fremont is actually a bar that serves a small variety of burgers, sandwiches, and appetizers that could be considered higher-end bar food.   Mac & Cheese Balls were all mac and no cheese, unless the little plastic tub of cheesy-flavored dip served with them was supposed to be the cheese, and had a distinct artificial bacon flavor. Being only macaroni noodles in the fried balls, they were dry and bland and overall were a disappointment.   Chicken Bar Bites with their Honey Mustard sauce were plump and delicious and were served with excellent sweet potato tots. These were a winner.   After these two appetizers and a couple of small mason jars of Guinness at $8.00 each and house cocktails at $10.00 each we bailed and headed out for dinner somewhere else.   BTW the Downtown Las Vegas powers-that-be have decided to go against the Strip philosophy of free parking for everyone and have made street parking in the blocks around Park on Fremont pay-parking only.",

I have had the fried chicken and waffle sandwich with a side of sweet potato tots multiple times and it has never disappointed. The portion can be big, so half has been my lunch or dinner the next day. My favorite though is probably their garbage fries, a mix of fries, jalapenos, and egg among other things. Great for 3 in the afternoon or 1 in the morning.  Their beer and a shot is a deal for $12 and a great way to start a night out. Mixed drinks are also fun to explore, I personally like pillow talk. If you make it out to weekend brunch (which I don't see how you can't since it ends at 4 or 5), get the patio pounder. $20 for a bottle of champagne and orange juice.  Be sure to check out the trivia pursuit cards on the tables, and the see-saw out back.",

I can't forget the fact that it resembles a home with its white picket fence in front. It could be their delicious foods and drinks menu because what else would attract you to a place? Or maybe the weird, creep Disney-like decor! Perhaps its all the above combined!  This restaurant is located right down Fremont St, across from The Griffin and on the same side where Vanguard is. It can get pretty loud depending on the time you go, so if you're planning on going with friends to have some good conversation - I suggest you go on a weekday. Unless you want to be stared down by strangers and have to yell over the table, then by all means.. Come here on a weekend night.  They have a small menu, but it works! We went here with some friends so we were recommended items prior to even coming here. We started off their Chicken Wings (1 lb) and asked for the sauce on the size. These were delicious, but then again.. I've never came across a bad serving of Chicken Wings. Our main course consisted of sharing a Philly Mac and Cheese Steak (it is definitely share-worthy) alongside Garbage Fries. The meal was more than satisfying, but can I just rave for a second on their Garbage Fries?! I know it doesn't sound appealing, but their Garbage Fries consist of everything GARBA-licious smacked right on top of fries. I mean... cheddar and provolone cheese, bacon, jalapenos, green onions, tomatoes, peppers, avocados, and an egg! I probably will never not order their Garbage Fries when coming here. I feel like it would be a disservice to all things related to fries and I would be dishonoring a Fry God (if there is one). We complimented our food with 2 rounds of beer.  All in all, I left part of my stomach here at The Park... Meaning I will be back!",

Food wise, lots of good choices- the strawberry summer salad, chicken bar bites (corn-flake breaded chicken), the street tacos, fried pickles, garbage fries, you really can't go wrong with the food.   The decor is super fun, and make sure to check out the teeter-totter situated behind the back patio, where smokers go to escape and diners go to let loose.   Note for those looking for parking, I usually park at Neonopolis, it's usually 2-3$, and its in a parking garage which is across the street from Park.   Cheers!

I got the fish and chips (swapped out for sweet potato tots...rare, I have never seen those before). My group tried the chicken and waffles (yum) and a lot of the mixed cocktails. Great food, I'd highly recommend the place to anyone traveling to LV and staying in the Fremont area.",

If you are a wine drinker, forget about it. Trying to be healthy (not many options there), I ordered the Asian Chicken salad with cucumber noodles. The salad was mostly cut up iceberg lettuce, hardly any chicken and I was hard pressed to find the cucumber noodles. My friends loved the garbage fries, but their sandwich was meh.   Our waiter tried, but he was in one section inside and ours on the back patio. The singer they had on the back patio for Sunday bruch was terrific.  As a local, I'd advise you to walk up the street to Radio City Pizza (new menu!) or across to Le Thai if you want to eat and drink well.",

There is limited seating inside and out front, but the best place to eat is on the park like patio in the back of the building. The building is out of place for this urban setting, it looks more like a Southern California beach shack in the 1970's. The interior decor looks to be photos and art from a bad dream. The food and service is what makes the place great! Our limited exposure included the best fried pickles that I have ever had. The Old School Park sandwich was selected at the recommendation of the server. It included brisket, Pastrami, coleslaw and a few other garden items on a french roll. It would not have been my first choice based on the description if not for the recommendation. It was a great choice and I would highly recommend it. The service was attentive. The only down side was the parking. We had to part across Las Vegas Blvd in a high rise parking structure.",

I asked if there was any seating inside and she answered rudely 'you need a reservation ', which is understandable. I then asked if we could be seated in the back patio and I got the same RUDE response!!! She needs to be trained to talk to customers in this event. She seemed so bothered with what I was asking!! She could have said something like: hey just so you know for next time, just make a reservation so that we can accommodate you better. As she walked us to the front to be seated she had told us with an attitude to pull two tables together and have a seat and walked away!!! She was clearly having a bad day and it showed!!! I had been here a few months back so I was anticipating to eat here all month long and bragging about the menu and how great it was but this girl was so rude that my party and I went elsewhere!",

Now if they would just kick out the management and kitchen, they could have a delightful little joint. I have been here twice, and the food has ranged from passable to woeful. Upon my last visit, I had the Cuban sandwich and fried pickles. The pickles were decent. The Cuban was dry and tasteless. What makes this even sadder is that it is difficult to screw up a Cuban sandwich. It is so basic and usually delicious. The beer selection is fine, but seeing as they are serving the drafts in glass that are less than a pint, the prices are a bit steep.",

    "text": "Park is a solid 3. If I'd drafted this the last time I went instead of this time, I'd have given a 4, but this time I finally made it during happy hour. Don't let it fool you; it's a horrible misnomer. The lower prices on the happy hour menu accompany what are basically half-sized portions, saving you no money at all on food or cocktails. At least the waitress warned us about the small portions before we ordered them & ended up even more disappointed. So basically, you're not getting better pricing for happy hour; you're just ordering tapas.  On previous trips, we've tried the chilaquiles (enormous portion, and really good!!); the San Diego burger (my dining mate scarfed it before I could try a bite, & says it was also really good); the chicken bar bites (if chickens had cojones the size of a great Dane, that's what these are -- no bite-sized bites here!); and the Philly mac & cheese sandwich (decently good, though I was expecting more mac & cheese... the other Yelp pics showed much more than we got on that trip). Based on all of those, and the service, which is normally pretty friendly and mostly timely, I'd give a 4.  This last trip, the waitress started out friendly until we expressed amused disgruntlement at the \"happy hour,\" and thereafter she was nothing but flat-lined personality with us, although I went out of my way to be upbeat & friendly with her. Apart from that, we ordered the fried pickles (which we've had before -- pretty tasty! They're cut into slices and are interspersed with fried pepperoncinis, too, as well as sometimes a whole jalapeno!), and we were excited to try the Cuban sandwich and the garden burger.  The Cuban was the most uninspired version of that meal that either of us had ever tasted -- the bread wasn't grilled & pressed, and somehow they took most of the flavor out of this inherently tasty mix of ingredients. The garden burger was the most bland veggie burger I've ever had (and that's saying something). Looking at the patty, it looks like it should be good, since you can see some black beans & tiny pieces of colorful veggies, but it seems like they used zucchini, maybe (or some other filler/black hole of flavor), for the rest of the patty, so the flavors were stretched too thin. They topped it with tomato, cucumber (which I love in the right context, but in this case it also just added to the blandness), and arugula (which, normally tasty, just got swallowed up by the blander ingredients as well). The super light basting of the chipotle mayo-like topping could barely be noticed. If I had to eat this dish again, I'd order an extra side of the stuff & slather it on to see if it made a difference. To get an idea of what a really awesomely executed veggie burger / bean patty tastes like, go to Ri Ra.  As a general note, the accompaniments for most sandwich & burger items are either fries (the seasoning is really good, and the ketchup is slightly spicy, yum!!), sweet sweet potato tots (that other \"sweet\" is in there for a reason -- they're topped with cinnamon/sugar, & while they're good, if you like sweet potatoes, we both felt they'd be better served as a dessert rather than a side for a savory dish), and a couple other things we've never bothered to order, I think cole slaw and a side salad. Some day I'll order the side salad to see what their dressing is like, but I'm not a fan of 98% of cole slaws.  We'll definitely keep coming back & trying the other plates Park has to offer, but we'll be avoiding the \"happy hour\" menu and those last two offerings. It feels claustrophobic sitting inside, but both patios are nice!",

The decor is amazing, from taxidermied pheasants fornicating behind the bar, to Cinderella's carriage on the rooftop out back. This is the perfect place to kickback a few cocktails with your friends while enjoying quite the bizarre scenery. The service here was also amazing.

    "text": "A lot of great, but also some not so great.  First, the great.  Location and atmosphere are fantastic.  Nice setup.  It reminds me of downtown where I am from so I had a particularly home like feeling being there.  The music was also on point.  Overall a great feel here.  The shooter made with Absinthe is by far the best drink made with Absinthe that I have ever had.  A very difficult feat, because as a main ingredient absinthe is hard to make tasty.  Absinthe, despite all its hype, tastes like ass.  This shooter however did not.  I believe it was called the Funderwear.  I could do more of these, and they could be dangerous.  Also the shot/beer combos available are a nice touch, and something I will be coming back specifically for.  The beer list itself, needs to be reformatted.  There is no organization to it at all.    The specialty cocktails were decent, but a bit lacking in complexity, and a touch on the sweet side.  They weren't bad, but they also didn't jump out as very memorable.   Then there is the bad.  The Veggie sliders are a complete disaster of a dish.  I am curious if the people making them have ever actually eaten them.  Sliders 101: ALWAYS TOAST THE BUNS.  Serving sliders on untoasted buns is culinary blasphemy.  The patties weren't cooked very well, and overall they had a slapped together feel to them.  The tots that accompanied were added insult to injury.  They taste as if they are either dusted with confection sugar, or semi-battered with funnel cake batter.  Applause for the shot at uniqueness, but simply a sad moment for anyone who enjoys tots.  I have NEVER not eaten all of my tots before.  I am a fatty when it comes to tater tots.  I will devour villages and small cities worth of tater tots.  Generations upon generations of tots have been simply wiped out by me.  I couldn't muster the will to eat more than 5 of these and all 5 were eaten somewhat forcibly.  My natural instinct to love tots was thrown into a distraught mess of confusion.  Tater tots should be crispy and crunchy on the out side, and warm and plentiful with hot fried potato goodness on the inside with a touch of salt.  You want to get crazy, add a spice to them(Cajun maybe?), or a unique sauce on the side.  For the sake of all that is delicious, ditch the funnel cake version, please.  This was the only dish we had, but I have heard similar criticisms from foodie friends of mine about many of the dishes here.  Just because you are downtown doesn't mean you can slack on your food.  You are in downtown Vegas, one of the biggest food epicenters of the US.  Your biggest target market is locals, and the locals in Vegas are foodies for the most part.  We will wait for food, and we will pay for food, but it needs to deliver.  You have such a great location for what you are offering, take advantage of it.  The servers were very friendly and engaging, as well as the hostesses.  Whoever did the hiring of the FOH staff made solid choices.  Very refreshing after eating at some places with impersonal and seemingly unconscious staff lately.  I do hope the food improves, because I really enjoy the vibe here and that location is in need of a great spot to eat at.",
