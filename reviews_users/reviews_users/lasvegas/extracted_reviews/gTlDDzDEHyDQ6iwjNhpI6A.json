    "text": "We were here for dinner.  One of the best meals we've had in awhile.  Please note that the food for dinner is freshly prepared and has no relation to the lunch buffet.  My husband had a mixed tandoori platter, and I had a vegetarian platter.  Then we shared.  Probably enough food for four people, but it was so good that we polished most of it off.  The vegetarian platter came with an appetizer of deep-fired vegetable fritters - well seasoned and not a hint of grease.  Also a rice pudding dessert - sweet and light.  A standout was the homemade cheese in the palak paneer.  Also the naan.  The chicken tandoori was the best I've ever had.  So often it can be dry and stringy.  This was juicy, tender, and perfectly seasoned.  There were two servers, both gracious and helpful.  Although this place is close to the Strip, it was not touristy.  We'll be back.",

I became aware of this place after searching Yelp for an Indian restaurant and have never looked back.  The restaurant is just a couple of minutes away from my work site so the lunch buffet works out really well. I can immediately sit down, order my plain naan bread and start dishing up.  The food is always flavorful and there are always very many options to choose from. They take care of the vegetarian and the meat lovers between us. I take particular joy in the Chana Masala at this venue - a delight which is shared by one of the waiters who told me this a while ago :)  I love the fact that I can go back to scoop some more of any Indian curry with which I can enjoy the remainder of my naan bread. I have ordered a Chicken Tikka Masala take out with Mt. Everest before and that sparked off my 'must have' mindset with which I now approach every trip to Las Vegas.  I confess that I will easily come here more than once per single work week because that is how good the food is. And as for the price - you will hardly ever convince me of better value for money elsewhere.",

Our server, which I believe was also the owner, was incredibly nice and sincerely thankful for our business.

    "text": "Let me start by saying that the food is delicious (on most days). My review will be covering my lunch buffet experience only, so please keep that in mind when reading.  Pros: Plenty of variety - Chicken tikka, tandoori chicken, saag paneer and so forth. The naan is freshly made, but be sure to mention custom requests such as Garlic naan etc while you are being seated (or they assume you want it plain).  Cons While the food quality ranges from good to excellent, the customer service is lacking, depending on the season. The owner is a really chill guy, but he seems have 1 person working ALL the tables sometimes (which gets chaotic during lunch rush, and customer service suffers).  I've noticed he's hired more staff lately, but I suspect its only seasonal. My note to him - Keep your location well-staffed :)   I love their carrot dessert (gajar halwa), which is light years better than the sugary Gulab Jamun. They have a salad bar, which is decent.  My advice to readers - You better make sure you are leading an active lifestyle, if Indian Buffet is your goto for lunch. Although the food here is tasty delicious goodness, its not really good for your body :/ Authentic Indian food isn't this greasy or creamy, and most Indian people don't eat like this.  Because of the health implications of eating such loaded items, I tend to go there once every 2 weeks...maybe once a month.",

I was really hoping to give this restaurant an honest 5 rating like many others did and also why I stopped in here.. Perhaps in Las Vegas it may be considered one of the best but I've had many Indian cuisine experiences mainly in the valley of L.A. where theres many Indian places. But the food lacked somewhat here. The first thing I was surprised at was the garlic naan bread was not included for dinner, although it was good. First time I've ever seen an Indian restaurant not serve it as complementary. The chicken tandoori was a little dry and mostly smothered in bell peppers, onions, and cilantro. Cilantro??? Had I known about the cilantro I would have requested without it. No basmati rice either although it specified in the menu that it came served with rice. Tikka was exactly the same. Now that I know a couple things about this place I may try again but order carefully. I was with a party of 6 and everyone was eh so so about the food. We were all pleasantly surprised with the service.",

I was really impressed that they were serving chicken tikka masala--one of my favorites!! The garlic naan is a must try!!! Hands down the best garlic naan i have ever tried. The bread was baked into perfection. The rice pudding was a delicacy!  I recommend this place!!! I prefer to drive an additional 1 mile than india oven. (We went there yesterday and walked out immediately cause food dont look fresh) come to mt everest and experience a day of indian cuisine:)",

We began with chicken momos, that were fresh and had plenty of flavor with and without the sauce.  We then got the chicken tiki masala, chicken curry, lamb korma and vegetable biryani.  Each dish was unique and the flavors built off one another. Our water glasses were never empty as the spices climbed, a True testament to the service.   Both the garlic naan and the plain are perfect accompaniments to the dishes and really round out the meal.   From the moment stepping inside and breathing in the fresh scent to leaving Mount Everest makes you feel welcome whether it's your first time or old regulars. I told my coworkers this is some of the best Indian food in town and I can't wait for my next meal here.",

We ordered a bottle of wine and a few various dinners and naan, which we did wait a little while to actually receive, but it was so worth the wait. Everything was amazing!

I always recommend the lunch buffet, especially for Americans that do not know what to order, they can easily try it. There is something for everyone. Not everything is so spicy. I love Palak Paneer, and this place has some of the best in Vegas! I love it, everyone is always kind in serving and even when they are busy, it's still a lovely experience. Don't forget the complimentary na'an at lunch... Very yummy!!",

It may have the old structure of the Burger King, but it's a nice and relaxing atmosphere where they don't rush you.  I was impressed with their tandoori oven chicken. It was very good portion. I've ate at some other places like San Francisco where they don't give you too much meat on the chicken, but this place in Vegas is really good. To tell if an Indian restaurant is any good is if they can't make the most common, typical Naan and chicken tikki masala taste good that Indian restaurants are famous for, then I advise you run away and head for the hills! But seriously, their onion naan was good and tasty. Everything we ordered was good and we will definitely go back. :-)",

    "text": "We decided to try this place based on it's pretty consistent Yelp reviews, and we're glad we did. A few reviewers have mentioned the sketchy surroundings, but I say if you can throw some carpet, a few tablecloths, and the drapes from an old bordello into a defunct Burger King and come up with a perfectly comfortable dining room, more power to ya!  I have loved Indian food since I first discovered it during a brief sojourn in London, when it seemed that the only options were steak and kidney pie or starving to death. (I chose the latter. Valar Morghulis)! Anyway, as a person who considers curry to be more of a drug than a food, I'm usually prepared to like what I get in Indian restaurants, which is a little meat floating in a sea of delicious sauce which you happily sop up with some fluffy, toasty naan, and fill up on the rice.(I'm getting hungry again just thinking about it). The difference here was that there was plenty of tender, juicy meat in that sauce; apparently a side benefit of keeping the rent low. Hope they don't get too big for their britches and move to Summerlin. Goodbye, meat!  I adore Chicken Korma and theirs was perfect; rich creamy sauce with just a little sweetness and those complex, spicy undertones that keep you coming back for more bites long after you're full. Chicken Tikka and tandoori were both served sizzling and still moist and juicy. The favorite appetizer, in a unanimous vote, was the lamb samosas. They were golden little pockets of pastry stuffed with seasoned, finely ground lamb, but the best thing was what wasn't there: My sister didn't find a hard thing. Mind you, if there is ground meat involved, be it burgers, sausage, meatballs, whatever, she ALWAYS gets the hard thing, and the rest of us have to suffer along with her. It's one of life's little miracles that she didn't, and practically worth a sixth star. Will definitely return to try the lunch buffet, but don't be surprised if they raise the price after our visit.",

    "text": "NOTE: Mt. Everest is the tallest Mountain in the world and it's in Nepal. When you enter this restaurant it's clear that it is Nepali with the Buddhist prayer flags, photos of Nepal, and the drape of Swayambunath temple image of Buddha's eyes hung up on one of the walls. Although, many of the dishes are Indian and the lunch buffet has many Indian dishes, a significant portion of the restaurant's menu is pure Nepali food. Being a Nepali, it's disappointing that the restaurant needs to be advertised at 100% Indian to retain and bring business. I just wish customers would recognize that it's both Nepali and Indian. They are two different countries with similar cuisines.   Anyway, hope some readers found that educational!   Now for the FOOD! As a lover of Nepali and Indian food, this restaurant is top notch. Definitely one of the best I've been to the in the United States. It rivals restaurants in Queens, New York which probably has the highest density of Nepali restaurants anywhere in the states. My partner actually thinks its even better than our favorite place out there.   We came here twice in two weeks when we were in Vegas for rest stops during our epic road trip. We both focused on entirely on the Nepali food side which is on the left. Their chicken chilly is AMAZING - so on point with the flavor. Perfect amount of onions, bell peppers, and loaded with tender and fresh chicken.   Their goat meat is as good as my mama makes it,  especially the gravy. A lot of Nepali restaurants tend to under cook or have really tough pieces of goat meat, but everything is so tender here, it's incredible! Chicken curry also absolutely delicious. The second time we were there, they had toor daal, so I had a traditional plate of dal, rice, meats, and vegetables and even ate with my right hand. The very traditional way of enjoying Nepali cuisine to the max!   Also, my partner and I bought a bunch of orders of Nepali momos to go, which they have on their menu outside of the lunch buffet. Simply delicious. So authentic. Loaded with tasty meat filling! Loved having it later at our leisure.   I also tried all their Indian dishes and they're just as amazing. I especially like the vegetarian kofta. Each dish is perfect. I typically find that restaurant's that have both selections master one or the other. Mt Everest is a slam dunk at South Asian cuisine.   Whether you live in Vegas or are stopping through as a tourist, get your behind off the strip and come here for amazing Nepali and Indian food.",

    "text": "I can't believe it...I've been working in an office for years now, less than 5 minutes away from Mount Everest, but it might as well have been a world away.  I've only recently discovered this hidden gem!  I'm not experienced in Indian food, run-ins with curry and the occasional purchase of naan from Costco were about all I knew.  But wow...what a flavor bomb Mount Everest is!  Very unassuming restaurant on the outside..BAM!  Get your taste buds ready!  If you're very new to Indian food I urge you, start off slowly.  The multiple (and I mean multiple) spices used to make a majority of the food can be very overwhelming.  Indians are not shy with spices and they will throw everything in the book at you!  That can be a very good thing!  Wake up your senses!  Tastes from everywhere will be making your brain go BOING!  To be honest there must be a dozen or more critical spices used in Indian cooking, all present here at Mount Everest, I'll just name a few:  *Cardamom *Clove *Black pepper *Cumin *Coriander *Nutmeg *Mustard seed *Fenugreek *Turmeric *Saffron  Are you ready?  Thought I was but I really wasn't!  For your best options, go for the daily lunch buffet.  You get to try a little bit of everything that Indian food has to offer.  There are some definite familiar dishes along with a few that are great starting points for newbie Indian foodies.  Only a beginner?  Go for the tasty Chicken Tikka Masala over a bed of their Sweet Rice.  Sweet, spicy, but not too spicy!  Also go for the Tandoori Chicken, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger & herbs then grilled over charcoal.  Delicious!  More experienced?  Go get it with their Chicken Curry or their Goat Curry (yep), try a Veggie Samosa or Pakora.  Don't forget the dipping sauces!  Raita, Mango Chutney, and Tamarind are ready to accompany all of your entrees!  Vegetarian?  The buffet also offers a few good options like Palak Paneer - homemade cheese cooked with fresh spinach & herbs.  Or the Aloo Kauli - potatoes & cauliflower cooked with tomatoes, peas, cilantro, roasted cumin & coriander.    Please, please, please don't look a gift horse in the mouth - each table comes with a basket of freshly baked naan bread!  This is critical!  The curries, Hell just about everything goes excellent with the naan bread!  It's sooooo good!  Sop up all the extra goodness off your plate with a piece of naan!  If you get a chance order a basket of the garlic naan as well.  Carbs be damned!  Mount Everest is possibly the best Indian buffet around currently.  If you go for the lunch buffet be prepared to wait.  Tables are often full with regulars!  But it is totally worth it for the flavor explosion you will be receiving.  The price isn't bad either, $10.99 a person...what a deal!  Eat to your heart's content!  I've only been to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet, but I hear the dinner buffet as well as the regular menu is on fleek as well.  I will have to come back to give either of them a go.  But for right now I am happy with my lunch buffet for my Indian fix.  I will be back!  Everybody in the world....SPICE UP YOUR LIFE!!",

The place is cleaner, the service is much better, and the food was excellent (I only ate the vegetarian dishes). The food was better because they stopped over salting all the food so you taste all the lovely spices without the salt overpowering the dish. I don't leave feeling like I'm needing to drink water. All the veggie dishes I tried were just the right amount of spicy and not over powering. Now if the dishes could be made vegan (no ghee) I'd be over the moon! Thank you Mt.Everest...I'm glad I came back! Keep doing what you're doing!",

Tandoori chicken and chilli chicken are awful, I pity samosa for they called one of their dishes so (uncooked and tasteless potato stuffing in a thick shell).

    "text": "3.5 for food and atmosphere, 4 stars for service and price/value. I will round up to 4 stars overall.  I was craving Indian food so decided to check out this place for their lunch buffet. The interior is a bit worn, but it is clean and the workers are all very friendly.  There were a decent amount of dishes in the buffet, but not all that many to be honest. All of the food was tasty, and there was a good variety. Chilli chicken made an appearance again, and I'm starting to think this Indo-Chinese dish is a Las Vegas Indian buffet staple. While chilli chicken is indeed a very popular Indo-Chinese dish, I never saw it in Indian buffets when I lived in California or in Virginia.   The meal comes with freshly baked naan, and there is no surcharge if you want garlic naan, though it does take a little longer to prepare and you have to ask for it. Water is included and served in cute mason jars, and the servers were pretty diligent about refilling waters and clearing used plates.  Overall, at $10.99 for a lunch buffet, Mount Everest is a good value and has decent food. It is not the best Indian buffet I've ever had, and nothing particularly wowed me or stood out, but it is a solid restaurant for sure.  P.S. I find it ironic that the restaurant is called Mount Everest India's Cuisine even though Mount Everest is located in Nepal. xD",

This called for a visit that was long overdue, so we scrolled down the list and picked the highest rated place in town which was Mt. Everest. At $10.99 for a lunch buffet of a pretty good spread that would please just about any palate:  Basmati and Sweet Rice, Jhukuni Aloo, Vegetable Samosas, Punjabi Kadi, Palak Paneer, Mattar Paneer, Gajar Halwa, Chicken Curry, Goat Curry, Chili Chicken, Chicken Makhani, Tandoori Chicken, Salad Bar, Assorted Chutneys, Naan, and Rice Pudding. I tried every offering once, then went back for seconds and thirds of my favorites, the sweet rice, goat curry, punjabi kadi, and both paneer dishes. Honestly one of the best lunch deals in town.  Service was great, water glasses and our naan basket was replenished quickly, and you can watch and listen to some Bollywood action while enjoying your meal. Looking forward to returning, and this time, no need to wait for that blue moon!.....ALOHA!!!

Now comes the time for the making the decision making and after reading the reviews this restaurant was picked. Its little off the main strip. The location is in sort of a strip mall but as it the first place from the main road so don't worry you wont miss it :).  Now lets talk with the ambiance, so this wont blow out your mind and just standard.  The food variety is good for both veg and non-veg. There was good selection of the non-veg and generally the mutton is not easy to cook and this place has mutton served the day we went and luckily it was not under-cooked.  The nan's were hot and fresh.  The staff is friently and from Nepal. The owner didn't charge the money for the kids which I am not sure if all the other resturants do that.   In the end i have to say I can out with yummy food in my tummy.  If you are in vegas and want to try Indian i will recommend this place.",

Tender goat curry, mild to medium spices (I'm not a fan of tongue-burners), sweet carrot halwah (ground), sweet orange rice, potatoes and eggplant, palak paneer (spinach), samosas, naan, pakoras, yellow Dahl ... all wonderful. This was 12/24 and the place was packed for lunch. But the staff was gracious and efficient at getting all seated quickly. The chaffing dishes never ran out despite the crush of the 80% Indian/Pakistani clientele. My only suggestion would be to not add sugar to the raita. Otherwise ... a solid winner.",

The food was honestly good (and spicier than Mint, which was a welcome change of pace) but the surroundings are kinda bleh and we didn't get refills on our naan and we had to wait forever in between pop refills. The service was pretty iffy. The buffet selection is decent and I liked that they had samosas on the buffet.  The food was good and I wouldn't object to going back but there are other places that I think offer a better all-around experience.",

At last I found my \"go to\" place for a curry away from \"home\". I come here nearly every week and of course it's nice to be warmly welcomed by the owner Prakash, and his staff and then to be treated so well. I and other members of my family have probably had everything on the menu but being a creature of habit, my favorites are: lamb saag, chicken tikka masala, aloo gobi, mushroom mutter masala, keema naan. These dishes are consistently fabulous. Other notables include the tandoori mix grill, kadai chicken and chicken pakora. I cannot recommend this restaurant highly enough. Between the outstanding food and wonderful service I believe it is the very best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas.",

Yelp led us to a different Indian restaurant but because it was New Year's Eve and there was a ton of traffic crossing Las Vegas Blvd, we opted to go here instead.  We were happy with our choice!  My favorite Indian dishes are Tikka Masala and Palak Paneer with naan.  However, we saw that there was a dinner buffet line.  We asked, and to our surprise, it was only $10.99!  Sold.  Typically, dinner buffets at restaurants have a limited selection.  At Mt. Everest, pretty much all of their entrees are included in the buffet.  I can't remember everything, but I know they had about 8 different main dishes (including my two faves above, and about 3 different curries), samosas, dessert, and fresh fruit.  They bring unlimited fresh naan to your table.  Everything was so good.  We are definitely coming back next time we're in town.  Definitely worth the $11!  I came here on New Years Eve and at the end of the night, the server gave me a rose.  How sweet!",

I dined solo and arrived around 1:00pm (buffet ends at 3pm). The food was still hot & delicious. The rice was still soft. And it wasn't too loud or too busy. The server and the manager were so incredibly polite. They periodically checked on me to make sure everything was to my liking and my water cup was always filled to the brim!  The food was awesome! A variety of lamb and chicken curry. A few vegetarian options. The samosas were on the salty side but still incredibly delicious. They had plain rice and a bright orange sweet rice which was awesome but I preferred to eat the plain rice with all the sauces and meats. The naan was fluffy and as delicious can be. ! I managed to scarf down a whole basked by myself!  Next time I'll be asking to try the garlic naan too. I saw a table next to me order it and it looked awesome!

I'm more of a Japanese or Thai  curry person. After today's meal at mt everest I will b eating more Indian curries . The lunch buffet was really good . Everything was hot and fresh,the naan bread both garlic and plain was super . Everything I ate I enjoyed  daal,tandoori chix, some spinach and cheese dish a lot of other foods don't remember the names. Service was attentive and the restaurant look alot better inside then out,I think it was a burger king in it's former life . Like I said not an expert on Indian food, but this was goooood!!",

THIS restaurant however,  is completely the opposite of my preconceived notion.   We went for the lunch buffet.  It was amazing.  Everything was fresh and hot.  A very good selection of both vegetarian and meat dishes.  Most everything I tried was absolutely delicious.  I went back for seconds and even thirds.  The next day, I came back for more!    The restaurant was clean, the decor tasteful and comfortable.  The price was very good too.   Careful though, all that curry can get to you.  ;)",

I would say service was a solid 4 stars (although there was a bit of the soft upsell here on beer and extra side items like multiple orders of naan), but food was 2 stars, 2.5 stars tops.  I really like the strong and bold flavors of Indian cuisine, and also the quality of the sauces, which tend to be very smooth, with supporting notes of texture like cashew or other items to provide some 'tooth' to a dish.  I found the sauces here to be very heavy, a bit 'gloppy' and just lacking in quality - the sauces just weren't inviting to me.  Actual taste of the sauces was ok - serviceable, but nothing great.    Also, lamb was pretty tough, and chicken had small bones (the kinds that should not be in a dish, small enough to catch in one's throat and cartiledge - just unappetizing.  Paneer dish we had was one of the better items, but sauce still had that heavy and unpleasant texture.  I have not yet found an Indian restaurant in Vegas that measures up to Origin India in its heyday.",

Also it looks like a converted Burger King and the decor is a bit drab, but decided to try it anyway.  We had 2 great dishes and the Naan was excellent.  If you can overlook the very basic decor and consider the food end service, this place is great.  We would eat here again.  A note to the owners if you read this. Get rid of the florescent lighting and add more soft lighting. Maybe get spend a bit to warm up the atmosphere and you will have a winner restaurant! good luck.  Prices seemed mid range for Indian Cuisine. I think we had two dishes and Naan totaling about $25 before taxes. Very fair for quality food.",

Being an Indian, I would expect the items on the buffet to be little bit hot and spicy, but it wasn't the case here. Some of the dishes were sweet with little or no salt. That is the reason i gave it 4 stars. The garlic naans served was great. The kheer, gulab jamun and sweet honey rice were good. Overall I recommend it. Will definitely visit the next time i come to visit Vegas.",

I remember hostel messes in India doing that to keep people from eating too much??? I agree with some of the reviewers here that the Owner/waiter needs to have an attitude makeover. He scowls if people ask for another round of nans.Thankfully his cellphone did not go off while we were there...And rice pudding as a desert! I can't remember when a Indian resturant got away with pulling that stunt off. India has so many wonderful deserts and surely rice pudding is somewhere down at the bottom of that list....If you have to eat Indian in LV, maybe this would be my recommendation just because others are worse (Mint-ok, Origin-terrible)",

    "text": "I visited this restaurant last night while in town on a business trip based on previous reviewers from yelp. I was glad that the outward appearance of the restaurant had been mentioned, as it may have kept me from going in if I had just been driving by. Once you enter though, it's a great environment with the white tablecloths and napkins. As someone dining alone, I particularly enjoyed the Bollywood playing in the corner. It kept me entertained while I was waiting for my food, which was an excellent break from the standard of playing with my phone. I ordered the Chicken Tikka Masala, which is my basis for judging a restaurant (much like Pad Thai at a Thai restaurant). The sauce was amazingly creamy, and had a slow burn to it, which I find the hallmark of a good sauce. I want the spice, but not at the expense of the flavor. The naan was perfect with a crispy edge and soft center. Ideal for sopping up the sauce.   But even more than the food, the service was phenomenal. Everyone is very friendly, but give you your space. My water never got below half-way full, and I can put away water like a camel, so that's impressive. And when I had a problem, they were endlessly gracious and worked with me while I figured it out. Few restaurants would take the time or effort to come up with a mutually satisfying solution the way that they did.  End result: If I lived here, I'd weigh a million pounds because I would eat here all the time. As it is, I'll have to settle for stopping in every time I'm in town.",

This was the first time we had real authentic Indian food.  We ordered one of the Thali specials: Mount Everest India's Cuisine Special. Which was a platter of mixed appetizer, papadam (Indian chips) chicken tikka masala, dal makhani, palak panner, lamb curry, chicken tikka (4pcs), rice, naan, raita. When the platter came out, I honestly didn't know which was what, but everything was SO good!  We also had the Tandoori Chicken. This was my favorite dish we ordered. It was chicken baked in a clay oven, marinated in yogurt, garlic, ginger, herbs, and spices on an onion and bell pepper bed on a skillet. All the dishes were so flavorful from the spices. And the portions were huge! We ordered a lot for just us two and only spent $43. But we had yummy leftovers to take home. :)  Service was quick and friendly; always kept our waters full. They also have an all you can eat lunch buffet. Will be returning.",

They also offered free papadom along side the appetizers. Most of us ordered chicken entrees, all which were pretty delicious. A friend of mine ordered the prawn vindaloo which I really liked. The dishes were rich and spicy and there was enough where we could share with each other.   I would definitely come back. The prices were good and the staff was attentive and friendly.

The vegetarian momos were delicious and the sauce was amazing. While leaving Las Vegas, we wanted to eat some more of those momos, but the owner informed us that buffet was ready to serve, and we could order momo if we wanted to during  he buffet hour. I have tried multiple Indian buffet, but here daal and vegetables tasted like Nepali homemade khana. I loved the Gulab jamun!! Overall, food was amazing! By the time we were done with our food, I saw the place was almost full with customers enjoying the food!!",

After spending 25 years in a part of the country where Indian food ( great food at that ) was as common as a Starbucks - I got used to my week having curry stains on my fingers, and then it happened, I moved.... and moved to a place that not only did not have Indian food, but the town had not one red light, nor anyone who liked THAT type of food. Uggggggggg.  Then on a trip to Las Vegas, I found Mt. Everest, and fell in love!  The wonderful people there understand what great food, friendship, and service is. I had even left a book there and they held on to it for over a week until I could return. I wonder if it was my subconscious having me forget it so that I had to go back for another wonderful experience. Yummmmmmm !!!  To top it off, they even called me a cab. I felt like royalty, and left knowing that I have not only found the best food in Vegas, but that I had also made friends.   I will soon be moving my business to Vegas, and know that when I return there is a place with friends, and great food, to come to anytime I get the urge.  If you are looking for a wonderful experience, and don't want to make a mistake about where to eat - This Place Rocks!",

We went around 1 pm, their peak time, and even during the stress the staff took the time to get to know my baby niece's name and catered to us before we were even seated. They were incredibly patient and humble. I've yet to meet restaurant staff like this.   FOOD: We went during the lunch buffet time. It is $12.99 / person. Every dish they presented at the buffet offered a different delicious taste that my entire family enjoyed. My personal favorites were the Punjabi Kadi and Daal Makhani. The gulab jamun was also perfectly made - not too sweet. The in-house made samosas and pakora were also tasty! I honestly didn't want to leave. The food was that good.  SERVICE: The staff took the time to speak to us in Hindi and English. They refilled our waters and took away our used plates quickly. (These are things I notice at a buffet style restaurant.) They had a baby seat for my niece and were readily available to answer our questions and help us with a SMILE. Also the bathrooms were clean!  If you're in the Vegas area and are looking to try a family friendly authentic Indian restaurant with lots of both vegetarian and non vegetarian options, I'd strongly recommend giving the place a go!  Some things to note- for lunch it's only a $12.99 buffet and dinner is a la carte.  I didn't take a picture... was too busy eating haha",

Of the curries I sampled, heres what they tasted like -   Mixed veg korma - sweet and creamy  Chicken curry - sweet Chicken Tikka - sweet Dal makhni - bland. And no trace of salt.  Chilli chicken - sweet. Yes, this traditionally spicy indo Chinese dish is sweet here... Akin to mandarin chicken at panda express.  Pakora - manageable but somewhat soft and soggy Tandoori chicken - cold. But perhaps better than the remaining dishes.   If you are expecting a spicy Indian fare.. Look elsewhere.",

I don't normally like goat but they cooked it here to taste like beef which was very nice. The naan was the BEST naan I ever had!!!!!! It was just plain naan and I wasn't expecting much but man I was wrong. It was the perfect piece; slightly sweet, chewy, salty, and so perfect. I would order fifty of these when I come back. It is a hole in the wall place that isn't well lit and it's also in a sketchy part of town, but other than that lunch buffet is a must try. And eat the naan.",

Tamarind sauce , mint sauce , cucumbers , onions etc. And for their dessert they have numerous sweet dishes , but I didn't get to try because I was too full of the amazing food! All of these selections for 10.99!!!!! So amazing ! When in Vegas come to this place , rather than Other places in downtown Vegas!!! And let me  say the mango lassi and the chai tea get a 5/5 star rating too!! FYI if there's a wait , better wait than to say sorry ",

Somehow I have hard time imagining that anything here will disappoint. What stood out most, though, was the service. It had a wonderful lightness and alertness. No hovering, just a perfect awareness of our needs at the table and the rhythms of the meal. I'll be a regular. And in my next review I'll check the menu so I can be more specific about what I ate.

I was hoping to try their Chicken Masala but they didn't have it, instead I tried something with red sauce and chicken breast, chick peas and potato with cauliflower. It was all just okay. And the Naan bread smelled rotten.   It was kinda dark and service was not friendly, the guys seemed kinda lazy. I just saw them mostly standing around and talking to each other.

They used an appropriate blend of spices that weren't overpoweringly spicy!  For an indian person I don't do as well with spicy food as one might expect.  This was a great balance of flavor amidst the kick in my mouth.  (I did ask for mild)  I came here for dinner and not going to lie was a little turned off by the outside.  Very seedy looking place.  Then I stepped inside and saw that it was decorated in a comfortable manner.  Clean and efficient enough.  (at least for appearence's sake!).  They brought out some papadum and a couple sauces to go with it. I ordered the shahi paneer which was good, (not the best I've ever had but again i'm partial to homecookin).  One little complaint I had was that I needed to ask for water a couple times as I tend to drink a lot of it while eating.  This is usually a given at higher end places, but as there was only two people working and it was rather busy i'll give them benefit of the doubt.  Also when I asked the waiter if I should try the shahi paneer or the paneer tikka masala he said he didn't know because he didn't eat vegetarian food.  (in a slightly rude manner)  Overall worth the trip and they provide a solid indian food experience.",

Granted there were a lot of bail bond signs around and title loan locations, but that does not mean it is a bad part of town.  Walking into the place, I was hit in the face with the smells of India, but not like it hit me in the face with a metal bat, more like a large fluffy pillow. We were seated and given our menus. As some of the others on here have said the mixed platter is excellent, the waiter is also very hydrating.  I thought I was in Delhi while eating. Without the monkeys, or the 2 billion people around. It has been almost 24 hours and i am still stuffed. This place has made me rethink about the indian food I get in San Diego. I probably will never be the same again.  The one chick that works there, that we saw... like a 9 on the hotness scale too.",

The only problem- we visited the place twice and both times they had the same menu for the buffet. I dunno if it was just the days we visited, but would have been nice if they had different food on the buffet the second time. Overall a great place esp if you are really hungry, esp when you get em muchies",

They have prepared the briyani with kind of ready mix powder. It was not well cooked, lamb curry was also half cooked,the naan was not at all like naan. Thank god at least the mango lassi was good. People who have never tasted the actual Indian foods will think this is the taste of Indian foods. This is not Indian food flavor. It is tasteless. I advise them to learn how to prepare Indian foods. Don't spoil the taste of Indian foods. I will never go to this restaurant and I will not recommend to my friends as well.",

    "text": "Have eaten the lunch buffet here at least 15-18 times over the course of 3 years, and I must say that Mt. Everest is finally in it's prime. I immediately sensed a new chef 2 visits ago, and my guess was confirmed by the owner. The owner was visibly excited about the new chef's contributions, smiling and describing all of the new dishes. Tastewise and lookswise, the buffet has never been better. It costs $1 more than before, but it is worth it.   The Sambar soup is perfectly seasoned, the new dishes (Chicken Chili, Vegetable Korma) are colorful and tasty, and the overall spice level is kicked up one notch closer to a straight-up medium. The Chicken Mahkani is masterful and complex - as good as some of the best Chicken Tikka Masala-type curry I've tasted. The Dal Mahkani is a 3 or 4-bean variety and is much improved over the previous chef's version. Great Samosas and Aloo Vegetable varieties. Very importantly, the buffet console is boiling hot so all of the food is steaming hot and remains hot on your plate several minutes after you sit down at your table. This is a huge detail that can make or break an Indian buffet. Mt. Everest nails it - keep it up!   Business seems better than ever, which is a good sign that I'm not the only one who feels like this food has gotten really good. Typical to an Indian lunch buffet, the fresh-baked naan and roti are complimentary, but the whole wheat roti is especially good here - one would expect it to come out traditionally thin and flat, but the Mt. Everest version can be mistaken for a puffy naan bread - a nice surprise. Whole wheat roti has taken the place of white basmati rice in my Indian lunch diet.  Buffet plates and bowls are clean and shiny. Water glasses are refilled constantly, every single visit. Finished plates are picked up quickly. Overall service is great. My only warning is you may smell like Indian food for the rest of the afternoon, so if you are on your way to an important meeting in a small office space, maybe bring a change of clothing if you are self-conscious about that kind of thing. I guess this is proof that when you eat the lunch buffet at Mt. Everest, you are immersed in a cauldron of Indian deliciousness.  Go now and get it while it's hot! I've waited this long to write a review because if I really care about a place I want to make sure it's right before friends go try it for the first time. (see my Cravin' Cajun review).",

    "text": "Being Indian and all, I can cook Indian food fairly well, but I seek out Indian restaurant for the beautiful diversity of regional specialties that I just don't know how to cook or do not have the equipment to cook (eg. Tandoor oven). In the 3 years, that I lived here I have yet to find an Indian restaurant that blows me away, but Mt. Everest is one of the \"better\" ones.   Came here on a Saturday night around 7:00 PM. Not the best looking place from the outside, but still hopeful this was a diamond in the rough. The parking lot was full however, surprisingly there were only two other tables filled. However, towards the end of our meal the restaurant filled out.  My husband and I got there before the other couple joining us (it is one of their favorite restaurants).  The staff immediately greeted and seated us.  We had a few moments to look around...decor is a bit dated with the dark green upholstery, but well kept.  We ordered a bottle of wine from the limited but reasonably priced popular wines.  Once the other couple arrived, they were immediately recognized as familiar faces by the staff.    Prior to ordering we were served complimentary papadoms with the tradition mint and tamarind chutneys. We ordered Tandoori Chicken as an appetizer. This is a great value given there were atleast 8 pieces.  It came out sizzling hot, serve on a cast iron skillet.  I wanted to love it as its sight and sound captured my senses, but it was missing that aromatic smell.  That is right, it was not aromatic or flavorful...kind of bland for Tandoori, but nothing offensive and definitely well prepared.  Still worth getting, because it comes out fresh and sizzling, just spritz with lemon and sprinkle  salt it is more than fine.    Shortly after our main dishes came out--palak paneer, chicken tikka, rogan josh, garlic naan, and a side kachumber salad.  First off, the portions were plentiful, and more than enough to feed four hearty adult appetites and two for lunch the next day.  The palak to the palak paneer makes that dish silky, creamy and very comforting, but could use a bit more spice although it was ordered at a level 6 on spice scale (1 to 10).  The chicken tikka was tasty and familiar in the sweet, tomatoey style...I prefer it slightly less sweet, but again, well made and worth trying.  The rogan josh's flavor was complexly layers and my favorite dish; it almost like my moms!  However, we ordered it at a level 10 spiciness, but it was much milder than expected.  Although I don't eat bread, according to my fellow dinners the garlic naan was fresh, warm and soft.   The kachumber salad was standard.    Throughout our meal,  the manager/owner(?) kept checking to make sure we were satisfied and of course, asking if we wanted more wine once we finished the bottle we order.  He gave us generously filled glasses for $5, and we had a friendly conversation.    Overall, the food was prepared with quality ingredients and with care, but lacked a bit of seasoning.  I haven't returned to many Indian restaurants in Vegas, but I am sure to return to Mt. Everest because the food is good, well priced, and the manager and staff is friendly... a special combination lacking in most Indian restaurants.",

    "text": "Saw the yelp reviews and had an out of town visitor who loves Indian food best of any. It was shocking to see it had a drive thru window and the neighborhood is a bit sketchy but not scary. Once inside it was very small, dark and stuffy warm. We all three had the buffet and it was about 12:45 when we arrived so you'd think it would be well stocked. The chicken korma was all sauce, no chicken to be seen and of the rest of the dishes, some were sparse, some were old looking with sauces separated and the Tandoori chicken was only dark meat and not nearly crispy enough on the outside nor cooked well enough for me inside. The samosas were cold & too doughy and I didn't like the rice being sweet, I prefer savory with veggies in it. The chili chicken was tasty but also very greasy and the vegetable korma was good and I enjoyed the spiciness of the food, it packed a heat punch. Naan was just okay, I would have ordered garlic naan if given a choice but service was sluggish and we were fairly ignored. My daughter needed water since all of us had empty water glasses and no one refilling so I got up and poured all of us a glass of water from pitchers they had sitting nearby. The guy copped an attitude after that and did his best to completely ignore us. I'm shocked that yelp reviews this as the best Indian in LV because I'm definitely going to my favorite, Mint Indian Bistro, next time I want Indian food.",

No glitz and glamour here, the restaurant is nothing fancy, but what it lacks in grand decor it easily makes up for in  tasty delicious fair-priced cuisine, AND they actually understand HOT when I say hot for how spicy I want it.  Almost brought me to tears (literally), it was beautiful.  Don't worry, for those who like less spice, my hubby orders it milder, and they get that right too.",

We had the lunch buffet, and it was so good that we could not stop eating even though we were both full. The gentleman who greeted me was so nice and sat me right away. I never had to ask for a refill on my water as he was very attentive to that was well. The only negative thing I would even mention is that I wish that the dishes had an english description in addition to the indian names because there were many that I had no idea what it had in it. I like to try new things so it wasn't a huge issue, but it would have been nice to know what I was eating.   Definitely worth a try, especially when you get eat for two people under $25",

As the other ladies mentioned - the Naan basket is out of this world. Garlic and plain!? Yes please ! I might have eaten like half the basket - sorry girls!!   I should also mention despite the location and the shady looking exterior, the inside is neat and clean and very spruced up.

I love Indian food and I will skip this place and drive farther to get decent service. It was me and my sister, with my two year old daughter and we ordered two entrees with naan. They did not tell us it was gonna be a long wait, and the couple that got arrived 30 mins after we did ate before us! They kept glancing over at us in pity since we had a hungry two year old. My daughter was very well behaved considering, so I don't know why they kept putting us off saying it was gonna take twenty more minutes for food. It happened at least three times. That's why we waited so long, because of the empty promises that our food would EVENTUALLY come out. I won't ever eat here again.",

    "text": "***THIS IS A REVIEW FOR THE LUNCH BUFFET.  I HAVE NOT BEEN THERE FOR DINNER***  Wow, I was a little surprised.   I had heard so many good things.  Perhaps this was just an \"off\" day for their lunch buffet.  Let me explain that we were not treated badly, we were just ignored for the most part.  I tried almost everything on the buffet and I enjoy eating Indian food and was looking forward to lunch here since the day before since I had never been.  That said...   I have been to several different Indian places here in town and after reading other reviews I didn't know exactly what to expect.  The service was barely there and the lunch buffet (about an hour and a half into service) was messy.  The steam table was occasionally being \"refilled\" instead of changed out.  At least, theoretically, the food that was there at the beginning would only last till the end of the lunch hours. There were a few other cleanliness issues but I'll leave it at that.    The tap water served in the cloudy glass could not be overlooked.   The items on the lunch buffet itself, some overcooked, were just okay at best.  Other items bear only slight resemblance to the preparations I've had at other Indian places.  I really do enjoy Indian food and I really went into this WANTING to like this place.     There are a lot of Indian lunch buffets in Las Vegas and if you have the means to go to a different one... *sigh* ...go.",

My wife and I saw the high ratings on yelp and decided to give this place a try.   Unfortunately, we didn't quite reach the summit on this place in terms of our satisfaction, but this is based on just one try.  Lamb samosas- Too dry.  Chicken Tikka Masala- Not the most flavorful masala we've had. Felt like something was missing.  Lamb Curry- This was my favorite dish. The lamb was super tender, and the curry sauce was savory with the right amount of spice.   Service was outstanding throughout and that made the experience a more enjoyable one.   We'll definitely be back to Mount Everest again and hopefully reach the top then.",

The Service - Prakash, the owner/Manager does a wonderful job from greeting you when you enter to making sure the food arrives before your stomach growls for the second time! The other staff was on point too!!!   Definitely a must visit!",

The food is deeply complex - if you like spicy food you don't just taste heat, you taste every flavor. If you don't like spice, don't worry, everything can be prepared mild and it's just as delicious. The naan melts in your mouth. The rice is fluffy and fragrant. The home made deserts are small portions of rich, delectable, deliciousness! I can't say it enough... Eat here!",

My favorites from yesterday would be the potatoes, the roasted chicken and the chicken in the tomato curry sauce. I also enjoyed the fact that they offered a nice little salad bar of romaine, cucumber, tomato, onion and jalepino.    I will warn you that this place is on the small side and the sit pretty close together. It fills up quick! At 12:30p it was full and shortly thereafter there was a line. So get there on the early side of lunch (the lunch buffet is offered until 3p)!",

I came here with a frequent patron who claimed this place is the best in Vegas, and even she said that the food didn't taste how it normally should. The flavor profiles were all off.   Chicken tikka masala- 1 star. The curry didn't taste right. no richness, not much buttery or creamy flavor.   Paneer saag with chicken (spinach dish)- 1star. I wasn't too impressed. Nothing too special about this dish.  Aloo gobi (potatoes and cauliflower) - 1 star. Cauliflower was overcooked, mushy, and lacked flavor.   Garlic naan- 1 star. The dough was undercooked in certain areas.   Samosas with minced lamb-2 stars.  I've always gotten potatoes or vegetarian so lamb was a first. Inside was good, but the breading was really strange. It was super doughy and over-fried making the texture almost as crunchy as biting into a rock. Not like I know what that's like...  Service- 5 stars. Our glasses were constantly full, they are on top of their game.   The highlight of my dinner was the green sauce and tamarind sauce they give you at the beginning with some fried stuff. That's about it. I'm a bit afraid to give this place a second shot after my experience as I was really looking forward to it.",

I have tried other Indian restaurants in town and found them to be either too expensive or catering more to the Indian customers at not giving me very much attention. Mt. Everest was recommended by my Indian doctor (not for health reasons) and it is everything for which I could have hoped. You can expect all the usual fare prepared well and to order. I am vegetarian and my girlfriend is vegan. We were guided through the menu very kindly to support our dietary needs and a couple dishes were altered to further that cause. Can't wait to return.   #2-Wonderful food and they really work hard to make things right. My girlfriend is vegan and \"assumed\" the vegetarian dishes were vegan. Nope. Many of those contain yogurt or are served with a dollop of butter. The owner quickly took care of this and made something special that was completely vegan. It is much appreciated and after our second visit we are even more impressed than after the first wonderful visit. We will be returning and telling our friends.",

    "text": "I have been craving Indian food for a while. Haven't gone to any of the well known places in town until today. We were downtown  and close to a few Indian restaurants  and decided on Mt. Everest for lunch.   The minute I opened the door, the aroma of Indian spices welcomed me in. It brought back memories during my years in The UAE. The place looked clean, the staff were friendly, attentive and helpful....and the food was really good. They serve hot buttered naan with the meal. I requested garlic naan and they happily obliged. I excitedly went around the buffet to check what they had to offer. The first thing that caught my eye were the samosas. It was hot, freshly cooked and pretty good. More doughy than what I'm used to but still good. Then I see the chicken curry and goat curry in the very corner...boom! Be still my heart!  Those two dishes didn't disappoint at all. The goat pieces were so tender and the gravy was addictive. The chicken curry was equally good. I couldn't stop dipping my naan in the gravy. The chutneys totally complimented the curries. I also tried their chicken tikka and their chicken tikka masala. They were ok. They also had about 4 vegetarian dishes but everything pales in comparison to the curries. For dessert I tried kheer and gulab jamun. Their kheer was refreshing and not overly sweet  with a slight cardamom taste. Gulab jamun is good too but too sweet for my taste.   The place got pretty busy around 12ish. They had a lot of South Asian clientele which is a good sign. The owner, Prakash is nice and friendly. He was constantly making sure that our needs were met. We left happy and full.   Price for a lunch buffet : $10.99....definitely not bad!   I wish they served biryani during lunch but no worries. This place is definitely worth trying. We will be back!  Our verdict:  Service - 5* Food.    - 4.5*",

    "text": "Looking for a place to eat that was different. Decided on Indian food and found this place with high ratings on Yelp. Set the maps app to this place and started driving.   Found it easily as it's well marked and has parking right in front.   As we entered, we were greeted right away and given the option of a booth or table, we chose a booth. Comfortable seating at the right height.   We were given this type of flat crispy \"bread\" to start with and two sauces. One was a spicy green one and the other a brown one. The green one was kinda green herb type and the brown was like a steak sauce like. Both were tasty and can be used for other dishes so we kept it on the table.   Ordered the butter chicken since it was recommended here. The chicken was boneless and cut up. Tasted kinda nutty like peanut butter (butter chicken?) not sure but it was tasty.   Got lamb curry and that was also tasty but not gamey.   Also got rice and garlic nan bread. The bread was heavily flavored with garlic and smelled so good. If you like garlic, get the nan bread and you'll be in love.   Service was excellent, my water glass was never empty for very long and I never had to flag down someone for a refill. There is also a tv monitor playing tasteful Indian music videos, adds to the feel of India. The colors on the wall and the decor resembled the color of spices but done tastefully.   Quality of food was excellent. Service was excellent. I would recommend this place without hesitation.   Side note, after I left I remembered I had forgotten my hat at the restaurant. I called and was informed someone was already seated in the booth and if I could call back later. After hanging up and about three minutes later, I received a phone call saying they located my hat :)",

My go to is the Paneer Tikka Masala. I love that creamy, tomato goodness on a bed of rice. The bits of cheese always add a great texture and a bit of protein. Garlic naan is always required as well. This spot has some pretty great naan - I could pack it up and eat it for breakfast, honestly. My partner also had an event eggplant and potato dish. A little too spicy for my taste, but if I had ordered it less spicy I would definitely be all about it.  Finally, I the service is absolutely amazing here.

This restaurant is a hidden gem - located in a nondescript building in the parking lot of a strip mall.  The food was fantastic!! Homemade from scratch Indian cuisine just the way your mama (if she was from india) would make. Don't be afraid to branch out and try everything on the buffet, there's more to Indian food than tikki masala!  Curry curry and more curry! Goat, chicken & chickpeas - all spicy and flavorful. The tandoori chicken is enhanced when you squeeze fresh lemon over it - the flavor explodes in your mouth. 2 different kinds of rice - sweet & traditional white basmati rice cooked to perfection. Tiki masala, the tried and True did not disappoint.  Tip - you can even get the buffet to go if you don't have enough time for the indulgence. Fit as much food as you can in 1 to go box, they will even give containers for sauces on the side along with Naan, fresh pita bread.",

Smaller dining area and no waiting area leaves people packed in. Nonetheless, the wait is short and definitely worth it. Not as many food options as Mint, but everything that is offered is delicious and well seasoned with the perfect amount of spice. Great vegetarian options. Plain naan is offered at the buffet bar instead of brought to your table, which I prefer as there is no delay in waiting for your naan to be made.",

My personal favorite was the vegetable curry with basmati rice and a mango lassi to pair.  The mango lassi was fresh and smoothly blended.  For dessert,  they had the sweet dough-balls in syrup, fruit, rice pudding and a few other items.

Perhaps what made our experience here 5 stars Plus is the service!  Our waiter explained the spicy levels and provided the perfect insight to aid in the decision making for our dishes.   We are DEFINITELY keeping this on our rotation when we go out for dinner!  The medium is a good base to start from regarding the spiciness of the food.  The medium in the chicken curry was delicious and had a very subtle and persistent after kick.  We'll probably step it up a notch next time in requesting the spice- but always good to try foods in the \"state\" that the chef envisioned.   Thanks for a wonderful dinner!",

Based on Yelp, we decided to check out Mt Everest India's Cuisine for a lunch brunch buffet on a Thursday afternoon.  I believe it was only $9.99 per person (clearly I did not pay) and it was delicious!!!  The food was absolutely fantastic.  The lamb did not have that gamey lamb taste and several of us who do not normally eat lamb went back for seconds (and thirds??).  The samosas were the best I have ever tasted (my husband is Indian) because they were not overwhelmed by potatoes.  You could actually eat one and still have room for the rest of your meal.  The service was excellent and based on the variety of different customers we saw enjoying their lunch Mt Everest India's Cuisine is clearly a favorite and worth the short cab trip from any Vegas hotel.  (They even called us a cab with a wonderful driver who had us laughing all the way back to our hotel!)",

The place looks a bit sketchy on the outside as the building used to be a Burger King and is in a somewhat run-down plaza. However the food is very yum! The buffet is not the most extensive, but the price is so cheap, especially for Indian food, and the dishes that are available taste pretty good. I am always on the lookout for some good vegetarian Indian dishes, and the 2 times that I have eaten here, there have been always several excellent choices. The palak paneer and the malai kofta were especially good, and their raita and chutneys are excellent accompaniments to the meal. The service is pretty good, too. The manager or owner is pretty friendly and always makes sure to fill up your water glasses. He also drops off a warm basket of fresh naan within minutes of seating you at your table and makes sure to ask if you need more naan. All in all, this is an excellent choice for Indian buffet.",

They were generous with the servings and with the rice, even offering refills on the rice.  The garlic naan was fantastic, but how can you go wrong with garlic naan?  The rice pudding is out of this world, fantastic flavors with this little warm dough ball plopped in the middle (a more authentic person than myself would probably know the name of this) that just made it decadent.    We had ordered an appetizer, two entrees, two soft drinks, dessert, naan and a side of raiti sauce and our check was about $40 so the pricing was extremely reasonable.",

I felt dubious at first. What the hell are these copper colored balls floating in a steamy translucent mixture? It looked like something out of Alien. But I was proven wrong. They were sweet, fragrant, and the perfect size. It was like a sponge donut soaked in a sweet sauce. So good! They were the perfect end note after a hearty meal.   The ambience is cute, too: white linen tables, nice glasses and silverware and a television showing Indian pop culture. Fabulous. Plenty of parking around the restaurant and the service was excellent throughout. I will gladly come here again if a pang for Indian food sparked.",

My favorites are palek paneer and the little veggie fritters.  I put curry sauce on the and eat them with rice.  The buffet is good, but just never as fresh as when the food is made to order at dinner time.  The service has always been exceptional, and if you are a repeat customer they will remember you.

I don't know why, but my husband and I always order our \"staples\" when we go to an Indian restaurant and we can be pretty particular about them.  Things were no different here.  Our staples are: Saag Paneer (called Palak Paneer here), Vegetable Korma, Mango Lassi, and Garlic Naan.  Because we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon, we were also able to order Paneer Tiki Masala and Vegetable Samosas.  Normally at other Indian restaurants this would be a ton of food for us which (sadly) we can finish if we are hungry enough (but we are giant pigs).  Mount Everest takes the cake for largest serving sizes in the valley.  We had two boxes of leftovers!  You are definitely getting your money's worth here.  Not only are the portions huge, but this is some of the best Indian food I've had.  They have given my beloved Mint a run for their money.  The Paneer Tiki Masala had great flavor and lots of paneer.  Plus the paneer was fantastic- it was denser than most paneer and had a very mild flavor.  I could be wrong, but it seemed like it was made fresh.  The Vegetable Korma was mildly spiced (in a good way) and was loaded with a large variety of fresh vegetables.  The Saag Paneer was a little different than what I'm used to, but I still enjoyed it.  It was a little milder, had a lot of cream, and the spinach was well-blended.  All these dishes we ordered medium, but they were pretty mild on the spice.  I think we could have could have ordered spicier and been ok.  The free Papadums were good and I enjoyed the mint and tamarind sauces.  The mango lassi, while having a very interesting intense orange color I'm not used to, was very good as well.  The vegetable samosas were gigantic but a little bit on the greasy side.  The garlic naan had every inch covered in garlic (hooray!) but seemed a little uncooked in the middle.    The service was very friendly but a little slow at times, especially when the place began to fill up.  The building may be a little iffy on the outside (what is that, an old Pizza Hut?) it was very nice on the inside and very clean.  Plus they play Bollywood movies!  Oh, and did I mention that they gave us an extra giant order of rice for all our leftovers?  For free?  Overall, this is a great place to enjoy some delicious Indian food.  Just be prepared to take some home!",

I had the bismati rice, green beans with potatoes, spinach saag, vegetable korma, and samosas.   The rice was perfect and not overcooked. Since I am vegetarian and absolutely love spinach, the saag was my favorite. Everything was seasoned well and had just the right amount of spice. I am glad this restaurant did not go light on the seasonings to appease some delicate palates.   I will say I am not a big fan of buffets, but all of the food was hot and fresh. I also liked the fact they had someone keeping a close eye on the buffet to quickly replace rice and any other food item that was running low.   On a side note, as a local, I forget there are a lot of tourists in town. When a large group stopped by on the way to the airport with luggage in tow, no one gave it a second thought and they were quickly accommodated.   I will definitely be back.",

Many of the items on the lunch buffet vary from day to day--some days there will be chana masala, some days vegetable korma, etc.  It's always great.  I actually like ordering from the menu better, though.  The owner is a very nice guy and works hard to make sure his customers have everything they need.

I was anticipating this place opening as soon as I saw the sign that it was an Indian restaurant AND had lunch buffet so when it finally opened, we had to go.  It did not disappoint! The lunch buffet is 8.99 and there is a great selection of food. It's not the BEST Indian that I've had but for the value, it is excellent!! The thing I also appreciated was the naan was included with the meal and you didn't have to pay extra for it as I had at other Indian restaurants. They give you a choice of either plain or garlic so we went with garlice. It was awesome! Hot and fresh from the oven, had herbs and plenty of garlic to our liking.  The service was great as well as the servers attended to our table and made sure our drink glasses were never empty. They checked regularly to ask how everything was.  All of us left VERY full and happy with our experience at Mt. Everest. We will definitely be returning regularly for lunch.",

The husband and I literally drove from Phoenix straight to Mount Everest for the lunch buffet. This buffet was no joke, the food on it was very good. We both felt it was one of the best Indian buffets we had been to. So much so, that I ate a ton of food and couldn't eat another thing for the rest of the day. Standout dishes were the chickpea curry, the sweet rice (never seen this before!), and the warm carrot dessert.... so tasty! The chicken tikka masala wasn't the best I'd ever had. Complaints include: we finished a full plate of food before getting the opportunity to ask for naan (they didn't bring any to us), our booth was in a weird corner you had to squeeze into, and their women's bathroom wasn't super clean (although I imagine that was from a recent customer and not due to a general lack of cleanliness). I would recommend this place to locals for sure.",

From service to presentation and portion size we had a perfect evening out. We ordered Saag with Lamb, butter chicken, tandoori chicken and garlic naan. The least favorite was the tandoori chicken. Not that anything was wrong with it, but because everything else was so damn delicious that the tandoori chicken was the only thing left over. This is our new go to place for indian food. I will 100% return",

For Entrees: Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Bhindi Masala (Vegetable - Okra), Garlic & Regular Naan (to dip w/ Curries), Chicken or Mutton Biryani (Indian Jumbalaya), Raita (yogurt sauce to cool you down if you can't handle the spice).  3. For Dessert: Gulab Jamun (Indian donut in sugar syrup), Kheer (Indian tapioca pudding).",

Everytime I eat at Mt Everest I am reminded that it is so delicious, but more importantly, it is THE BEST for customer service. Anyone living in Las Vegas knows True customer service is very rare. The owner, Prakash, is super slauthentic and polite and always makes us feel welcome. Tonight I ordered the wrong dish, Chicken Tikka instead of Chicken Tikka Marsala, and he made it right and did not charge me even though it was totally my mistake. I even offered to pay for it so i could have it for lunch but he would not hear of it.  A place with this quality of fare and the best customer service truly deserves five stars.  Thank you Mt. Everest for providing a place to dine where I can be treated like a person. I will be back soon!",

Overall nothing really to complain about.    I hear great things about their buffet and I feel like my meal was similar to their lunch offering.

This place was recommended by one of my clients that says she always comes here because the food and service is exceptional. I called-in the order for pick up and a gentleman helped me. I ordered the food items then towards the end I was confused because I wasn't sure how much I should order for 2 people. Then he said, are you ordering for tomorrow lunch as well? I guess I ordered too much. Haha! He said that he recommend removing one entree from the order and that should be more than enough for dinner for 2 people. I appreciated this because it was a lot of food! The gentleman was very professional and nice.   The food was fantastic! So flavorful, delicious and fresh! The garlic naan was a bit addicting. Chicken tandoori was very satisfying. You cannot go wrong with the food here. If you are into Indian food or you are a first timer, you need to come here and try! I cannot wait to come here with a group of friends.  One thing that I think would make this place even better is background soft Indian music to make the experience better. Just my thoughts :)",

My favorite is the Thali non-vegetarian, which comes with a mix of several small servings of different dishes, the fruit and nut naan, and a pair of mango lassis. This is enough food to feed me and my husband and we leave stuffed, for not that much money for a sit down restaurant. Once, we even brought our 6 year old and he was treated as courteously as any adult guest, with the staff making suggestions of things he might like to try. I love this place!   I recommend Mt.

The good items on the menu were: Kheer(rice pudding)-amazing! samosa-nicely seasoned and not greasy at all butter chicken-very good roghan josh( lamb)-very good  The not so good: dal makhani-dal was not cooked completely and was tooooo salty kadhi-it was made very well but toooooo salty again pakora-dry and hard white rice-dried out  Since they were busy, it was very difficult for us to get the attention of the server(who was the only one doubling as the cashier as well). We gave up and didn't get a second naan. It also took forever to get the bill so we finally walked up and paid at the register. It may be a good idea to get more help on the weekends.",

Small place in the ghetto, sahara and valley view, not too ghetto, but still, its not pretty on this corner, but inside, you forget about it quick when you start salivating at the door, and running to the buffet like a wild animal ready to eat yourself silly.  Take a breath, its ok, this place will give you everything you need.   Every indian spice is in something, the quality and freshness is stellar!   Hightly recommended, just see the other reviews, dont take my word for it, try it and take you own word, its amazing!",

We showed up and got seated right away. Very small, quiet place. All the employees were very nice and our server was very helpful with suggestions. There were 5 of us so we just got a bunch of different things to share. This dish I chose was the lamb masala! AMAZING!! Very sweet/spicy sauce and that lamb was cooked perfectly. By the end of the meal everyone was so full and the bill was very reasonable. Overall great experience and will definitely be back to try the lunch buffet!",

    "text": "Wow, I had high hopes for this place with all the rave reviews. This place was a flop! We arrived at 11:30am for the lunch buffet. The food was just ok, below average at best. They open at 11am, getting there 30 min past opening time, I'm assuming everything would be super fresh and piping hot. The food was just warm, by the time I made my plate and sat down it was already room temperature. I serve myself some palak paneer but had trouble finding any cubes of paneer in there. Ridiculous, if it was the end of the buffet, this makes sense but how are they going to last until 3pm if they already ran out after 30 minutes? The chicken tikka masala was meh, the chicken was super dry and almost grainy. The malai kofta - ok seriously, wtf!! The kofta balls were just floating on top of the gravy, they weren't even soaked in. I had to mix them in!! They were way too stiff. Then I make an attempt at the chili chicken. Again, I am searching for pieces of chicken in the vat of bell peppers. Oh and they were out of naan, so we had to wait which gave our food more time get cold - annoying!! The naan was super thick and more like a pita, I'm used to thin and crispy, charred naan, like a flatbread. I'm not sure how this place has so many epic reviews. I'm Indian and I advise you - do not eat here, you can find better. At least the $12.99 price was decent but who cares about the low price when the food isn't even worth it?",

As far as Indian food goes it was a little disappointing, spicy enough but lacking intense flavors and not a huge variety to choose from. The tandoori was dry and not season very well. I also found a hair in the plate but that's something I can forgive them for. The restaurant is small and darkly lit and somewhat depressing.  I was hoping it was good since I live right down the street, but I guess I will have to drive farther to go to my favorite Indian place Mint next time, it's worth the trip.",

    "text": "Wow. As in W-O-W. Full disclosure: I never thought I'd stumble upon my favorite traditional Indian restaurant in the middle of the Mojave desert, but this was no mirage yelpers. Mt. Everest is hands down some of the most delicious Indian I've ever tasted.   Right off the bat, this place has got a great atmosphere. Colorfully decorated and dimly lit with upbeat Indian music and a friendly and attentive wait staff. I felt welcomed right away and was glad to find that the menu was just as accommodating to me with its many vegetarian dishes. My biggest problem was narrowing down to a few dishes because truth be told, I wanted it to order up everything on that menu. But I started off with just the complimentary papadum, which was spiced with cumin and went perfectly with their mint chutney.   Let's just hit the brakes for a second here so I can tell you about this glorious green creation that became my favorite mint chutney ever to grace these tastebuds. It was just divine. So fresh and so smooth with the perfect balance of spice and herbs. My best advice? Arm yourselves with multiple sides of it and get ready to add that magic to the everything you eat - you won't regret it.   I started things off with the samosa which was flaky on the out, fluffy on the in, and stuffed with a yummy compilation of peppered potatoes and peas. Then I moved right on over to the vegetable pakora which didn't disappoint with the light and spicy batter (both integral mint chutney moments here, people). Then, as I was at this point very familiar with the art of going \"all in\" (RIP all my chips at the roulette table), I ordered up the whole Vegetable Thali which came with vegetarian appetizers and palek paneer, daal, and kofta. The paneer cheese was delicious, the lentils in the daal were too, and the kofta was a mix of delicious vegetables in a creamy tomato sauce, topped with nuts which really kicked the dish up a notch texturally. I also ordered the aloo gobi and the potatoes and cauliflower were cooked just right.   In a lot of cases, I'll order Indian with a high spice level only for the dish to come lackluster and plain as ever in the spice department. This wasn't the case at Mt. Everest; everything I ordered had me feeling like one of my girl Daenerys' dragons and I loved every minute of it.   Garlic naan was hot and fresh with great buttery and garlic flavor, the basmati rice was light and the perfect compliment to all of the plates. And the rice pudding was the first I've ever finished when ordering up the vegetarian dinner plate. It was an excellent cool down to a fiery and flavorful feast. At the end of our meal, the owner came to introduce himself and offered to make us another dessert especially for the table. After feeling like I ate my way through India itself and then halfway into Bangladesh, I declined - but you better believe your girl will be back to cash in on that goodness someday in the near future.  If you're visiting or in the area, I can't recommend this place enough. There's a reason it's racking up these five stars fanatics. Whether you're a local or just a passing tourist, Mt. Everest will have you feeling like you hit the dinner jackpot.",

I havent/didnt revise my review yet becausw I used to love this place, I refused to leave a negative review. Although the last visit, my husband just didn't feel like eating so I was the only one who ate (buffet). This place wasn't our plan for lunch but I'm pregnant and have random cravings so my husband was sweet enough to drive me all the way here. When we came in and told them only one would be eating, the older man gave us this look like he was going to roll his eyes. I'm not sure if he's the owner/manager but he's the one that often seats, cashout checks and answers the phone. Once we were seated, another man asked for our drinks. I told him two cups of water if it's alright since my husband wasn't eating. He gave us one. We let it go since my husband had a drink from Starbucks. As I ate of course I needed water. After my first trip and towards the middle of my second round  (of only vegetarian options btw-meaning what I ate were cheap food cost wise) I have flagged and asked three employees for a water refill but none of them came back. The owner or maybe manager guy also saw my cup empty but didn't bother to ask if I needed a refill. I saw him look at my cup. It was terrible. I lost my appetite without even finishing the rest of my meal. Again to give you an ideas what I ate, I was only eating Malai kofta, paneer and the plain binyari rice. It was the only ones I was craving. My husband was already upset from the beginning but was shocked when I got up telling him I'm done while still chewing. I walked to the cashier and he followed me. We there there for like 10mins tops. The owner/manager even said \"oh done already?\" So I told him \"yeah I lost my appetite. I asked for water multiple times and no one came back\". He said \"oh sorry about that\". But still didn't offer it. Wow just wow. We come all the way here from Sahara and Town Center. And we've brought our families and recommended this place to many friends. Never again will step foot here nor recommend it. There are 2-3 Indian buffets near us but chose this because of their Malai kofta. Check out Angara, they have way better service and a more beautiful restaurant. Also, I recently just read they were once on Dirty Dining yikes!",

The restaurant is clean with ample parking and easy access in comparison to many other Vegas restaurants.  People have typically low expectations when going to a lunch buffet, but we were blown away by the quality of the food. I personally prefer vegetarian Indian dishes, and they did not disappoint. Aloo gobi was the best I'd ever had. The potatoes and cauliflower were cooked to the perfect tenderness and  had the perfect seasoning. The palak paneer was unique and savory. Chana masala was more acidic and fragrant than I am use to, but it was a welcome change. Don't get me started on whatever that sweet rice is called, it's orange, and is made with magic and cashews.  The non vegetarian dishes were quite good as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy without being heavy. The goat curry was delicious, savory and perfectly cooked. The flesh fell off of the bone and was more tender than I thought possible of goat meat.   After I mopped up the delicious remnants of my meal with the fresh crispy naan brought to my table, I realized not once did I find my water glass empty. The hosts were very friendly, and checked on us often at our table. Prakash, the benefactor of the restaurant, stopped by to make sure the food was to our satisfaction. After asking about taking some gulab jamun (a must try) to-go, he brought some over free of charge. Beautiful man.   If you want to eat Indian while in Vegas, THIS is where you need to go.",

This place has become one of our Vegas attractions, we might someday come from California just to have this buffet.  Ok let's talk about food -   sweet rice is absolutely mind blowing, I cannot remember a place which serves this dish anywhere which has right sweetness.  Samosas are light and non oily which makes it perfect for appetizers.  Goat curry is awesome as well if you like goat though...  All other dishes are very good and fresh as it can get.",

I came here based on Yelp reviews and left highly disappointed, not because it was bad (it wasn't, it was just pretty good) but because of the notion that this is as good as it is supposed to get in Vegas.  Granted it was only for the lunch buffet, but I guess I don't know if it will get any more than marginally better for made-to-order entrees.  Now, the food in itself is pretty good - decent flavors, ample choices for buffet.  But it's not very spicy.  At all.  That's actually a big deal because I think part of what makes curry & masala what they are is the distinct kick they produce.    Service is spartan due to the buffet nature, but is pleasant when provided.  Place wreaks of herbs, so I'm thinking maybe they need a bit more ventilation.  Area is a bit fishy, but out in the open so not too worried about safety.  In all, it's a fine place for Indian food but you'll leave wanting to see if there is something better.

    "text": "Decent food. Warm, personal service from the owner himself despite it being very busy. Biggest plus: you can get momos here!! Momos are like spicy xiao long bao with thick skins, or if you know real authentic Mongolian food (not those food court type places that basically reheat a pile of Americanized Chinese dry noodles for you), it's closer to a spicy buuz than an XLB.  This is Nepalese, not Indian. Our first time the owner took the time to explain some regional differences. It was clear that he is passionate about and proud of the food and culture of his people.  Aside from the owner, everyone was also attentive, polite, and good with refilling our waters.  We enjoyed everything we ordered here, not just the momos (though we liked those the best), and, what with the generous portions, ended up with enough leftovers to feed ourselves for days after. Mango lassi is pretty good here, not the best but nowhere near the worst.  PROTIP: Never bother with the buffet, not just here but anywhere. Everything is much better (though more expensive) if you order it off the menu because they make it for you to order instead of it sitting out congealing for the entire service.  Unfortunately you have no choice but buffet at lunchtime. It wasn't bad for a buffet. The tandoori chicken especially was tender and juicy, surprisingly not dried out. Some of the dishes even had a bit of kick for a buffet! (Usually buffets are pretty mild to cater to the lowest common spice denominator.) Favorites were the palak paneer (saag paneer), some aloo (potato) dish, tandoori chicken, vegetable samosas (relatively crisp considering they are sitting out on a buffet), chicken curry, and gulab jamun for dessert. Naan was also good and moist, not hard and dried out. Chicken tikka masala is on the sweet side. The goat curry was really tough, which was strange because it has been pretty tender when we've ordered it a la carte for dinner.  UPDATE: This place was on TV for cockroaches and unsanitary practices in the kitchen September 2016 but I don't care! Whee, germs!",

I started with rice, sweet rice, vegetarian starters like samosa and pakoras. They were just ok, i found pakoras to be a bit doughey. There was channa masala, palak panneer, dal, brinjal masala and couple more. I liked only the palak panneer. My wife is a vegetarian and to her, the vegetarian spread was just ok and naan was fine too. She was not very impressed. I moved on to the chicken items like tandoori chicken, chilli chicken, chicken tikka masala, chicken curry and goat curry. I liked them all, though i found some chicken pieces to be hard but overall taste was good. I loved the chicken and goat curry though. Dessert was the sweet rice and gulab jamun, they were good too. Overall an OK experience. Worth a visit for Indian food but not regularly.",

The server was friendly and attentive this time around and kept our water glasses full and answered any questions we had.  I am addicted to the chicken curry. I didn't know I liked Indian food till I found myself at home craving the creamy, flavorful curry with moist bits of chicken.. mmmmM I think the lunch buffet is definitely worth it at around $11 since dinner entrees can add up $$$. All the other buffet items are just bonuses but the chicken curry with garlic naan are what will keep me coming back for more~!!!  HOT TIP: Get the garlic naan! Way better than the regular naan but make sure to place the order as soon as you sit down or they will bring out the regular naan and you can't order a new batch till you finish it haha",

My favorites are their cauliflower dish and goat curry, but really you can't go wrong from anything in their buffet. Their plain naan is warm a perfect pairing with their many curries.    I have never had a problem with finding a table, even at peak hours.  Also their service is also super attentive and friendly.  I don't think my cup of water ever went empty.

    "text": "My favorite Indian restaurant (Gaylord) is now out of business and other Indian restaurants I've been to have been mediocre which is why I'm so glad I gave Mount Everest a try eventhough the place was kind of creepy.  The quality of the food is comparable to Gaylord's but you get more food and pay a lot less.  The people that work here are very nice and friendly.  They have Bollywood videos on at all times.  They give you a basket of papadum with mint and tamarind sauces.  We started of with samosa (they're like potato-filled empanadas with ginger and spices) and aloo tikki (fried patties of mashed potatoes in chick pea batter).  Mango Lasi: Creamy mango shake. 5/5  Veggie Samosa: You get two pieces for $4.  The crust was the right thickness and wasn't too doughy.  You can definitely taste the spices.  I had to use the tamarind sauce to tone down the heat a bit. Very filling. 4/5  Aloo Tikki: You get 2 patties for $4. Crispy deep-fried mashed potatoes.  Very filling as well.  Great flavor. 5/5  Palak Paneer: I was looking for the cheese on top since that's what I'm used to.  4/5  Garlic Naan: I love this stuff.  We had 2 orders. Hot, garlicky and buttery bread to scoop/dip saucy dishes with. 5/5  Chicken Tikka Masala: My favorite Indian dish.  We ordered mild but it was still quite spicy...but it burned so good. 5/5  Kulfi: A mild cheesy ice cream and you can see pistachio bits. 4/5  Gulab Jamun: My favorite Indian dessert. They're like hot cheese dougnuts in simple syrup. 5/5  I honestly wasn't expecting the food to be that good.  This is my new favorite in Vegas!  They also have a lunch buffet from 11am-3pm for $10-11.  I'd come back here for that!",

The problem I have is this, they don't tell you much kids pay for buffet. In the past I've only paid half so I thought that's okay,  when I came here this weekend I paid full price for both of my kids even though they did not eat as much as me and my wife and so I wondered. Any other buffet restaurants in Vegas they would have paid half price, since they are just kids. Most restaurants (casino or not) based their pricing on children's age, if your kid is over 11 or 12 they pay full and so on and so forth. I asked the guy who took my payment on why my kids pay full price when they are 6 and 8. He told me they based the price on how much a kid should pay based on much they eat, I say what??That is ridiculous, what if my kid is not a big eater, how can they assess this, by putting their plate on a weighing scale? I feel like I was scammed and for that this restaurant just lost a long time and loyal customer. It's misleading, I might even think of bringing a complain to BBB. Going somewhere else next time, for everyone else please be warn, if you bring your kids you don't know how much you will be paying. Should have went to SURA korean BBQ, half price for kids, more selections and cheaper overall!",

We were greeted and sat immediately. The food on the buffet looked pretty good so we went with that. Oh boy, what a good life decision that was! Just about everything I put on my plate was above average in flavor. Usually at an indian buffet there are at least 2 items that get left on my plate...Not here, the only thing I didn't care for was the potato samosas, and that's strictly due to the too thick, not crispy pastry surrounding the well spiced potato filling. The butter chicken was good,made with a mix of white and dark meat,and had a nice deep flavor throughout the chicken and sauce.  The paneer palak was wonderful and flavorful with a kick of chilies, My partner in crime enjoyed the veggie Korma greatly, as did I, it was creamy, with well rounded flavors and tasted very unique compared to other veggie kormas I've had. Heck it put mine to shame! They didn't shy away from spice or heat as some indian places do to adapt to American palates and I dig them for it. Service was a bit slow, plates weren't cleared as fast as I would've liked them to be, and my water glass was parched a few times but I'll cut them some slack for being a bit short staffed the day we went. Overall it was great!",

While I have been to several other Indian restaurants in town and enjoyed them, this is the place if you want the best food and a pleasant experience.  The owner, Prakash, greets us by name which I'm sure he does for everyone he knows is very attentive, likes to joke and makes sure that we have what want.  It's an informal atmosphere, so don't be surprised if they just point you to a table when you first arrive, that is no indication of the service. You will be well taken care of.  Don't let the neighborrhood put you off. It's a little down, but not even close to the worst in Vegas. It's well lit, and the parking is very close.  Tony",

And every time, they are amazed by this culture. Any restaurant that can impress all cultures is an extremely rare thing.   Three key elements  FOOD: 10/10   Reason being is because the food here is diverse and encompasses all common aspects of Indian food. Unfortunately, most places offer one or two specialities, and the rest is bland. Ever dish at Mt. Everest is a speciality because I can't find any other place with better food.  NO GREASE, NO FUSS, AND LOTS OF VARIETY! FOR UNDER 12 FOR A LUNCH BUFFET. their fresh baked bread I could eat all by itself!   SERVICE: 10/10  the owner himself, pradesh, was walking around to greet, and serve the customers. Any owner that is willing to clean and pick up dishes, is a phenominal manager in my name. And I have worked in food industry as a floor manager for 3 years. Extremely friendly, and sincere. Two things that are rare in this world!   AUTHENTICITY:   My best friend is very native to india and a wealthy person. He chooses this place over fine dining restaurants every time he visits me. There's nothing more to say.   This place is the only Indian restaurant that will sincerely and fully impress you.  -Charles",

The young guy who took my order was relatively nice, but the manager who was working at the front was on his cell phone as I came in and he didn't give me eye contact and just asked me how many??? I thought he was speaking to the person on his phone so I didn't respond until he again asked in a condescending Indian accent... I felt sorry for interrupting his phone call by visiting his dirty establishment. The restroom was also nasty and they had no toilet paper. The carpets are grossly dingy and dirty.

Its hard to have Indian cuisine for lunch for me because most places seem more upscale and a dinner style establishment. Not here! They make it very inviting and laid back!  The buffet option gives opportunity to learn about most dishes you have never ordered before. It was great! Sample some of everything.  My favorite was the Palak Paneer. Spinach with homemade cheese. If i could eat this with every meal for the rest of my life I think i would! Chili chicken is very good too!  The spice level was perfect for me, If it gets too hot try a mango lassi drink! I don't usually drink sweet stuff with my meal, but this drink actually compliments and cools the spice! Very good!  I always suggest this place to friends. I will go anytime!!",

That said, what is going on with this place!? I haven't seen the owner in months. I visited on Sunday and though they have 4 people working the dining room, service is a disaster. You have to beg for water and napkins. My water was refilled once in the whole visit, but the check was promptly delivered before we finished eating.   The food quality is WAY down. I couldn't cut the chili chicken with a knife, it was dried to jerky. My favorite, richly flavored makhani is now a strangely over spiced lackluster sauce.   The overall quality has taken a major hit in the owner's absence. I can only hope he returns and whips that place into shape!",

We ordered the chicken tiki masala which I certainly loved along with cheese nans. Wow perfect meal for what I was looking for. I only tried Indian food once before but it didn't catch my eye like it did this time. Might make it a weekly dish if I can find one as good back home.

Highly disappointed by the portion size considering how much it costs and that you can have all you can eat at the lunch buffet for the price of 1 small dinner dish. Best bet is just to go for the lunch buffet unless you have extra money to spend on multiple dinner dishes. We spent $60 on dinner for about the same amount of food we eat at the lunch buffet. Maybe I'm just a gluttonous pig =)  But the food is delicious and the lunch buffet is the best in town.",

    "text": "I never thought anyone could take the title away from Tamba on the Strip, but this is my favourite Indian restaurant, be it buffet or dinner, in Las Vegas.  I'm a vegetarian, so I can only comment on the meat-free dishes, although my husband the carnivore seems to end up using all of the same adjectives I do: subtle, complex, smooth, consistent, rich, plentiful, varied, fresh...  We've been visiting Mt. Everest since it opened over a year ago, but it was only last weekend that I got to try their Navratan Korma. A-ma-zing. Buttery, spicy, and not stingy at all with the paneer.  One thing I should confess is that I do love paneer dishes, save for that one most people love (sag paneer), so when I encounter an Indian buffet with only vegetable dishes, those vegetables better be pretty special to win me over. Mt. Everest is one of the few buffets where the vegetables are so tasty that I don't need a paneer offering to feel satisfied. (That said, Mt. Everest always has some sort of paneer dish, and when it's my nemesis sag paneer, they usually also have a kofta (dumpling) dish. Also, they always serve pakora, so I never lack for a \"hearty\" item on the plate.) I especially recommend their bombay aloo and any dal dish. One vegetable I've never seen at Mt. Everest is mushrooms, but otherwise the veg section is often a surprise.  Another point in Mt. Everest's favour, per my own tastes, is that they always offer samosas (small, light, pleasant) and vegetable pakora. Again, I like an Indian buffet that doesn't leave the more substantial offerings to the meat eaters. I also appreciate that the pakora is of the \"funny shapes\" variety, which I prefer to the greasier \"pressed patties\" you sometimes find elsewhere. (I'm looking at you, Bollywood and Samosa Factory.) The pakora tend to be small enough to not get overly dense, but - unlike my former fave Tamba - Mt. Everest never leaves you with tiny pakora \"droppings.\"  The dessert selection is certainly smaller than on some other buffets - almost always a sweet rice and a type of rice pudding (the names escape me). They're both solid fare, but I seldom seem to save room, so it's a bit of a non-issue for me. (It's saying a lot when I can love a buffet that doesn't offer pappadums or gulab jamun.)  The naan is billowy and brought hot to the table. When we finish, we are always offered more. (Sometimes we are also often offered garlic naan, although after reading others' reviews that may just be a perk for the regulars. No worries - if you come here once, you too will be a regular soon enough.)  Most of my comments above pertain to the buffet. If you like the buffet, dinner at Mt. Everest will not only impress you, it may spoil you for all other Indian places in town. How can something so delicious for lunch be even better at dinner? Perhaps it's being able to get exactly the dish you want spiced just how you like, but somehow they exceed expectations with care that goes into individual dishes. I particularly recommend the shahi paneer. It is now the gold standard by which I measure all \"creamy + nutty\" sauces.  I realize this review is very gushy, so I'm racking my brain for some sort of flaw lest someone think I'm on the payroll. I could pick on the location - a former Burger King in the Mariana's supermarket parking lot - but you know what? It's so nice inside that you'll never notice. The decor is simple but comfortable and fastidiously clean. It's not an ultralounge. It's not a reimagining. It's just a restaurant with terrific food and the occasional Bollywood video playing on the corner television.  Service is always very friendly. You will never want for ice water, and the staff takes a genuine interest in how you are enjoying your meal. The only way they could make me happier is to offer cooking classes. (Please? Please?!)   Oh, wait, I do have a criticism! Sometimes, I think the mattar paneer is just a teensy bit too full of peas... yeah, that's the best I can do. Sorry. Mt. Everest is simply rather wonderful In fact, it is the sort of restaurant for which Yelp should offer a sixth star. Mmmm...",

My friend got that as well and liked hers. The hubby liked his curry, too. We had exceptional service that night. Where they get downgraded is that they without a doubt served me leftover saag from the lunch buffet. The spinach was browned like it had been left under a heat lamp all day, it had tell-tale paneer in it that they missed removing even though I ordered it plain, and it was spicy as hell even though I ordered it mild. So disappointed in this place for trying to pull a stunt like this. Even though I feel this place may still be the best in town...I'm now on the hunt for my new favorite Indian restaurant in Vegas.",

But the items that they have are very good.  There is half for vegetarians and half for meat eaters.  I usually get a lot of the tandori chicken and lamb with curry. Their dessert rice pudding of some sort is pretty dang good too.  I think it is a staple of most Indian restaurants but they do it well here.  I usually grab 2 co-workers and use buy 2 get 1 free coupon and pig out once per month during lunch hours.  Dinner is the same but they dont have the buffet.

Walked into this restaurant with the aromatic smells of India.  We got there just in time before people started to come in . Seated in a booth they have table seating also it was a buffet so after taking are drink order we were told to go and enjoy the buffet .  All you can eat Lunch Buffet for $10.99 they had all the standard Indian Food but what really stood out for me was their Curry Goat which mesh so well with their Sweet Rice the flavors were how can I describe just Delicious , giving a touch of sweetness with the spicy flavor of the Curry Goat , the Tikka Masala was just as good. For many reasons it was like being invited to someone's home that really knows how to cook .  Both my Husband and I enjoyed this meal.  Being in Vegas let's put it this way you have to be good to stay in business because the competition is fierce and they are good and when in Las Vegas again this is definitely on my Itinerary !",

They tasted good enough when I first had them, except that the first night (sampled a bit of each) I had some symptoms consistent with perhaps either soy or lots of sodium. I blew it off and had the food again the next day for both lunch and dinner and, wow, was that a mistake. I ended up with a pretty bad headache and general malaise lasting several hours. I'm guessing they're not doing their sauces in house and are getting a pretty lousy second hand vendor's work. Yikes, really not good. I just don't think the stuff was made with fresh or high quality ingredients. No plans to ever get food from them again.",

For some reason, I rarely have good experiences with service in Indian restaurants, but the young men that work here are so kind and patient when being asked about recommendations. I think i've been here about 3 times now, so it's difficult to remember what we ordered but a few things stand out.   Chicken vindaloo- spicy, warm, thick sauce, delicious Palak Paneer- the cheese has a beautiful consistency and the spinach is cooked perfectly Garlic Naan- perfect Samosas- not the best here. The momos are a better option.  Yellow Lentil Soup- Good, but again, not life changing.  One suggestion I would make is that they update their decor! IThere's really a confused sense of style, throw in the mason jar cups...and well..none of it makes sense. But that doesn't take away from the food.",

They decided we didn't need any drinks and just brought in water no ice. How about a simple ask on what we want? How about asking us if we need more naan? - Place: meh!

The first time was on a Sunday morning, 10 minutes before they opened for a buffet. Everything we ate was fresh, all trays topped up. The service was also at par. Their goat curry was one to remember.  The 2nd time we went there was a little late in the afternoon, on a Sunday again. But somehow I did not get the same experience (with the food especially) that day. It was okay but nothing exciting. Oh and by the way, do NOT get their mo:mos. It's HORRIBLE. We tried both chicken and veggie and both of them sucked.  The owner (well, I don't know his name but I guess he is the owner) and guys who work there are very cheerful and accommodating. Their space is a bit cramped for a restaurant that offers buffet.  Thanks for reading. Cheers!",

I am surprised so many good reviews for pretty below avg Indian food - the buffet was were standard and did not really have any thing which stood out.  I guess high reviews are misleaders sometime, disappointed totally with the presentation, quality and ambience.  I guess people who put reviews have no or little understanding of Indian food.  By the way if you ask for Garlic Naan, there is $3 extra charge - which is very uncommon with other Indian restaurants in town. There are many better options.",

This one popped up the other day and it peaked my interest because good Indian/Nepalese food is hard to find. I was impressed by all the positive reviews and decided to take my girlfriend out this evening.  All I can say is wow, the food was amazing. Just as other reviewers state, the owner is very hands on and very attentive. We wanted to try everything and ordered the appetizer sampler platter (5 stars), Lamb curie  (5 stars), and the Chicken Tikka Masala (5 stars). Order of garlic nann bread and dessert to go I believe it was Kheer ... very good as well.   I also ordered a beer and she wine. When the bill came I expected it would be the normal $90-$120 when we normally go out to eat.  It was under $60 before tip so value is 5 stars as well Service 5 stars.  If you have never been here, go try it out. I guarantee you will be back. It isn't overly fancy in decor but makes up for it in everything else !!",

They have a spice level system of 1 to 10, we get 7 since we like a good kick to the food.  I like it really hot and had 8 once, which was hot and good for me but too much for my wife. She still loved it but had to eat slower.  7 from now on!  Naan is super fresh with nice crispy and soft textures. Samosas are crispy in the outside but not overdone, and fresh. Chicken Tikka also great.   Service has always been attentive and friendly. It's a family run place and the owner is super nice.  We love this place and always look forward to come my back when in town.",

I figured this place was an exception. But there are no exceptions in this part of town.  And if  you have anything to lose, then you have everything to protect. Because some of this riff raff clearly has -nothing- to lose.  ---  The people who own it are good people, honestly. They're not some uncaring idiots. They DO care about their patrons. They're honest, hard working people with a great menu selection.  But they're hardworking immigrants from India. They don't want to get involved in things better left to bouncers, etc. They're a family owned business and I understand that they don't want to pay the overhead for security.  I didn't think I'd need to have my gun on my tonight to go eat some curry. But in this area of town... you can't be too careful.  ---",

Maybe I just wasn't hungry enough today  The tandoori chicken was just a slight bit dry and we had to wait a bit for the naan to come out.  Overall a lot of Pros:  +Every dish had a unique curry flavor...wasn't the same curry taste in multiple dishes +Food was hot and fresh... +Food quality was good, you'd think you ordered a la carte +Service was excellent...water was always refilled promptly (the guy that gave one star and said they used tap water...not the case today) +Love that paneer spinach and cheese thing +Chili Chicken was good  We were there early enough so that when the cooks brought out the trays, they too took some plates of food from the tray into the back for themselves. For me that means no monkey business in the kitchen...you always assume there's not but I've seen too many episodes of Kitchen Nightmares.  The goat was so-so...kinda fatty and lots of bones, was hard to find a good piece in the whole tray...for $10.99 perhaps that's not enough to cover a lamb substitute and maintain profit.  I think what was missing today were my sweet monkey balls that seem to hit the desert spot and some beef korma...my favorite dish...I think they had it last time.  Despite this not being as good as I first remembered...it's still the best Indian buffet I've tried (been to about 3)  Overall a good spread and I will be back...call it 4.5 stars.",

It wasn't until after my boyfriend and I left that I laughed about it. He said they weren't making garlic naan because if they did, people would come to their restaurant and it'll be too busy. Haha isn't that what you want? Then he kept going and said \"we're going to continue serving it after the holidays. And we don't have it because it takes too long to make.\" Hahaha I didn't understand all the excuses. So I just said \"it's all right. Not a big deal.\" Although I was a little disappointed they didn't have the garlic butter naan because I always order it when I go to an Indian restaurant.",

Simply put...not good and not made with care. Samosas was searing hot on the exterior but had very cold spots inside. When it comes within 2 minutes of ordering...you know its microwaved and simply recycled from the lunch buffet. Mango lassi tasted like a bland artificial blend that was premade the day before. Mixed grilled platter was bland. Chicken was DRY, shrimp was overcooked, lamb was ok however. Chicken tikka masala was dry in terms of meat, the sauce tasted good but nothing noteworthy. The naan was NOT naan. It was too doughy, undercooked, and lacked in flavor. Lamb biryani tasted pretty good however and that's the only thing I can say I actually enjoyed compared to the other dishes.  Would not recommend. I've tasted real indian food and this place is simply NOT it.",

I've had their buffet a couple times, and it never disappoints - there are the typical things that I know and love, but there are always other dishes to try that are always yummy! When we come for dinner, I usually get chicken makhani at a spicy level 10 - positively to die for!  I know there are other places in town, but if you want the best Indian food, look no further than Mt. Everest!",

    "text": "Horrible, worst Indian food I have ever eaten. Wondering how the hell it got more than 4 stars, must be paid reviews. Fell sick after eating this food and that ruined my whole trip. Please don't take people's health for granted. I wish I could give minus stars. Now let's describe this in detail. First they served complimentary papad which was soggy. After all it was complimentary. The vegetable korma had literally big pieces of vegetables. Ok option is you cut it and eat. What if the potatoes are not cooked, well in that case u can't cut. The cauliflower pieces were so big that I wondered whether they even had a knife in the kitchen to use it. Now the next was goat biryani. It had sweet corn in it, who puts sweet corn in a goat biryani. Well they just used the ready to use cut vegetables and that has corn. Plus they had all kinds of dry fruits which was never mentioned, people can be alergic to some kinds of nuts. Now the million dollar question, how was the goat. Answer is amazing and normal human being teeth can't chew it. It was so hard that I literally had to throw away most of the goat pieces. It seems that they thought that they had to simply put goat pieces in the rice. FYI the goat has to be cooked well before putting it in the rice. I can go on and on but never mind, all I can say I will remember this place for a long time.",

A few minutes later the remainder of our meal, chicken makahani, lamb saag, plain basmati rice and kabuli naan (stuffed with raisins and nuts) appeared.  The naan was flat as a pancake and the filling was very bland.  Both entrees were large and delicious though the lamb was on the tough side. We concluded the meal with a shared portion of carrot halwa which was a bit too sweet.    Service, other then by the busboy, was abysmal from start to finish.  The sole waiter, I am guessing the owner, sat in a booth across the room from us playing with a cell phone and never once looked in our direction to determine if we or any of the other diners needed anything.  I had to call the busboy over to get our check and then it took the waiter an inordinate amount of time to process the payment.",

Easily the best Indian buffet in town, this place offers a small but very tasty buffet (about 12 items or so) accompanied by some delicious naan. The owner is very cordial and welcoming and will make sure your table is well taken care of.  A lunch buffet with a mango lassi (very tasty, btw) will run  about $14 and will be worth every penny. They also have a la carte items, which I have never tried, but I bet they are just a tasty as the buffet items.",

Try the vindaloo, it's some of the best I've ever had anywhere. I wouldn't recommend the salad, it's not exactly as pictured. The naan, however, is fragrant and fluffy!

The restaurant was pretty busy. The spread was usual, not a great lot of variety, but enough to satisfy your Indian food craving. The good thing was that the food was pretty spicy and flavorful. Not bland at all. The naan bread was soft and just amazing. Except the palak paneer ( spinach and Indian cheese) I think everything was made to perfection. The carrot halwa ( carrot pudding) was good too. The yellow daal tasted homemade, just how my mom would make. The butter chicken and goat curry were good too.  I always get excited when I see momos ( Nepalese Indian dumplings) on any menu. We ordered those with our buffet. But they were nothing close to what you get in India.  However, a decent place to have Indian food in Vegas. And it is around 15 min by cab from the strip.",

    "text": "When I saw Mt Everest getting ready to open I was initially a little put off by the locale - in a defunct Burger King building, next to a gas station, in a grotty parking lot outside Marianna's Mexican Supermarket on West Sahara.   Eventually we tried the extremely reasonably priced lunch buffet for $8.95 and were immediately blown away by the quality and variety of food here. I am a meat eater and my wife is a vegatarian, but there is so much for both of us.   The Chicken Makhani and Chicken Tikka Masala (these two rotate so you will get either one of the other) are both wonderful and there's always a few delicious vegetable dishes that are cooked and seasoned to perfection. Vegetables that I would never consider eating elsewhere are somehow transformed into pure delights.  Also excellent is the selection of pakora and the large, delicious Samosas (I usually manage to polish off three of these).  Freshly cooked naan (so fresh you almost burn your hands if you aren't careful) is so good you could make a meal out of it and some of the sauce from the buffet alone. Our hosts usually offer us our choice of plain or garlic naan - or even both. They are eager to please their customers here at Mt Everest.  Quite often I can tell when an Indian restaurant is going to be good by the number of Indian people eating there - Mt Everest attracts a diverse mix of clientele, yet does not fall into the trap of becoming too westernised. If I have one small criticism it is that Gulab Jamun (a personal favourite) never seems to appear as the dessert on the buffet, but this is an extremely minor complaint.  The dinner menu is extensive with as many as ten options for each base type of food (veg, chicken, lamb etc). At dinner you get a free serve of papadums along with well priced servings that were a good 30% cheaper than in some of the local competitor restaurants and possible TWICE the size - Extremely good value and the dinner time Butter Chicken could be the best I have ever tasted.  Note: You might want to look over all 1 star reviews of Mount Everest (and for that matter, all Vegas Indian restaurants) with a critical eye. You'll notice they are often from people who have written no other real reviews. I strongly suspect there's some \"review wars\" going on between different establishments. You'll notice they will always claim that staff are \"rude, disrespectful, etc\" - There isn't an Indian restaurant in Vegas I have been to where the staff have been anything short of gracious to the point of humble and Mt Everest is no exception. Don't believe the bogus reviews that claim otherwise.",

    "text": "Wanted to try Indian food in Las Vegas. Since my last visit there were over a half a dozen establishments. We picked this place because it had a good yelp rating. When we got there around 830, the place was ratehr quiet. Its a spacious restaurant but when its not packed (on a Saturday night), you start to wonder. It took a few moments before they got our table ready and a little coaxing for them to come an take our order. Although we were in no particular hurry, they did not seem to be anxious to serve us. I must confess the staff were in uniform and when they finally got to us, they were very pleasant. The best part was the food. We ordered Shahi Paneer and Bhindi Masla. (we were vegetarians). The food was delivered by someone who seemed like an important person (could have been one of the owners - he was not wearing a uniform) and in an almost ceremonious manner !! The flavoring was very balanced (we asked for medium), tasteful, well presented, hot and in adequate quantity for two. The Naans were fluffy and fresh. My acid test for North Indian restaurants is the paneer tikka masala but the shahi panner gave me enough evidence that the chef knew what he was doing. We finsihed our meal leisurely and just as we  were finsihing up, we noticed the other tables were filling up. After it was Las Vegas and perhaps we were there a little early. Enjoy this nondescript, off the strip authentic Indian cuisine. You should not be disappointed.",

To cut a long story short, I have eaten at Mount Everest on several occasions. The food is excellent as is the service, portions are generous and the prices are very reasonable. I have tried many Indian restaurants in Vegas and none of them come close to Mount Everest - highly recommended.",

    "text": "I woke up seriously wounded, defeated, +hungover on Saturday, and in a fit of hunger, I decided that my boyfriend and I needed to check this Indian buffet out. The price is right, at $10.99 per person. I also like how the lunch buffet is served every day from 11am - 3pm, which allows me enough time to catch up on my beauty rest on the weekends.  To my surprise, it was above average, very enjoyable; but mind you, not out of this world mind blowing. Plus, a small ounce of hatred flowed through me when I found out that they no longer served garlic naan for the lunch buffet...Man! I was really looking forward to that!   I appreciated their authenticity in the spice department. Whew! They don't mess around. Some of the items on the buffet such as the veggie samosas and the malai kofta, had some shocking heat and I loved it! I didn't care for every dish they had available on the buffet - Some were too starchy or dry, but no worries, there were more than enough options to get me stuffed silly.   Here are my favorites!  - Fresh Baked Garlic Naan Bread - they were on top of refilling our basket and making sure we had hot, crispy, fluffy and fresh naan throughout our meal. - Sweet Rice (basmati rice sweetened with honey) - It had a very faint sweetness and flavor of honey, plus I loved the color! - Saag Paneer - The cheese curds were a little on the overcooked and hard side, but the spinach curry was very deep and flavorful.  - Malai Kofta - It was interestingly sweet and packed full with flavorful spices, I loved the spicy kick it had. I really enjoyed dunking my naan in this one.  - Chicken Tikka Masala - The curry flavor was rather weak on this one, but it was very rich and creamy. The chicken was very tender as well.  - Tandoori Chicken - The chicken was tender and moist.  - Veggie Samosa - Spicy city! I loved the unexpected spices that came through in each bite. It woke my taste buds up!  - Mint and Tamarind Chutney - Refreshing and sweet. They both paired perfectly with all of the dishes and the naan. I especially enjoyed them with the samosa and the spicy curries!  - Raita - Very refreshing and cooling for the heavy and spicy curries.  - Rice Pudding - We loved the sweetness and the consistency with this rice pudding.  I'll Pass:  - Pakora - very dry - Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato) - wasn't too flavorful or memorable.  - Curry Chicken - boring flavor - Chili Chicken - dried out - Yellow Dal - too thick and flavor was not exciting  - Chana Masala - not memorable on the spices and flavor  - There were many other buffet items that just didn't stand out to me.  After our lunch I had a minor stomach ache - but I'll blame that on my hangover and all that alcohol that was in my belly. Tsk tsk naughty.",

We split an aloo chana, again, SO AMAZING DELICIOUS FLAVORFUL. Just had my left overs for breakfast, even better the next day. Nice restaurant, staff, bathroom, parking. Will be back!!!",

I would come here again and again .  I kept hearing \"that was the best Indian food I've ever had\" from fellow patrons...and for the price I would agree.

Carpets are super dirty bathrooms had no paper towel. - Servers dress very informal like if I'm eating at a taqueria or some street food place - Food is so so... I ordered the exact same thing I order at the restaurant I always eat and I was very set back with the flavors. Chicken korma wasn't creamy and it just didn't taste as good. Overall I would not come back... I always trust yelp fellows but this time I was let down.",

Such simple ingredients (lettuce, cucumber, tomato, and a dressing), with a nice clean flavor.  And then the barrage of flavor with Tandoori Chicken, Chicken Tikka Masala, Chana Masala, Aloo Palak, Lamb Korma, Dal Tarka,  Chicken Biriyani, Garlic Naan.  Service was excellent and attentive.

Their prices seem to be slightly lower than India Palace and their portions were definitely much larger.  We had the vegetable samosa to start- it was a tad salty but with the two chutneys, they really balanced out.  We also had: Chili Naan- was good, not spicy at all  Chicken Tikka- same as tandoori chicken but boneless. It was good, some pieces were a little dry but overall pretty good.  I don't understand the french fries on top though...that kinda threw me off..hmmm.  Lamb Vindaloo- delish.  Lamb were actual pieces of lamb, not the ground lamb like some places use.  Very flavorful, not too gamey.  Aloo matter- potatoes and peas in a sauce, again, large portion and large chunks of potatoes  Overall- everything was excellent, medium spice still gave all the entrees a little kick.  I just asked for hot sauce on the side to add to my food since I really like it spicy.  Will definitely be back, next time with my daughter as I know she will really enjoy it!  No butter chicken on the menu but think I'll try the chicken korma next!",

The menu will only frustrate, as everything looks great. I went with the vindaloo (lamb), an order of naan, and $5 glass of merlot. The merlot was about what you can expect for $5. The naan was a scoach undercooked and bland. The vindaloo was damn-near perfect. The waiter simply asked if I like spicy (no number game), and the dish was the just the right amount to get your tongue tingling, but not overwhelming. Sure the decor maybe flavorless and the staff unprofessional (a busser/assistant in a stocking hat?), but the spices are dead on. I plan many 'o follow-up at the summit of Everest.",

I had never tried Indian food before, and wanted to try something new for dinner so I brought along my two buddies for the ride.   Upon arriving, we were greeted with quick and prompt service, which was a very big plus in my book. All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed. My friends and I wanted to try different things and share, so we ordered a prawn curry, chicken biriyani, garlic naan, and a very very spicy chicken biriyani.  When the food arrived, I felt like I was in heaven! Everything smelled so good and looked so flavorful, I immediately started to dig in.  -The garlic naan was amazing, and felt like it just melted in my mouth. I even ordered another round because it was SO GOOD.  -The prawn curry was the right amount of spicy for me and very delicious. It was big enough for us to split between 3 people. -The chicken biriyani was very flavorful and had tender chunks of chicken mixed inside. It was definitely something I would order again!  My first trip to an Indian restaurant was a good one. I hope to come back sometime soon and try out something new!",

I got my weekly fix at my BFF's house, courtesy of her mom. I drank chai almost daily as an after school treat. Her mom is vegetarian, so I always ate the same thing at her house: some type of dal, rice, yogurt and fresh made roti. Flash forward to today, and that is still pretty much what I eat when I go for Indian.  We have only been to the buffet, so I can only base my review on the lunchtime offerings. I highly suggest that as you are being seated, you ask for garlic naan, if that is what you want. I stress, WHILE you are being seated. They are fast at this location and you will end up with plain naan if you don't speak quickly. They encourage you to start right away and your water will be waiting for you when you bring your first plate to your table. The naan will quickly follow. The samosa is vegetarian, along with a few other dishes. I have only had samosa, dal, rice, tandoori chicken, garlic naan, yogurt mixture and kheer. They are delicious. The only thing I would like to see is plain yogurt. I am not fond of the yogurt mixture, but I eat it because I cannot imagine eating  Indian food without yogurt... naan and/or roti. My man loves this place so much that he does not want to go back to Mint. I think Mint is good, but have had a plate get cold while I waited for my naan. The staff is pleasant and the place is small, but has air conditioning.  Enjoy.",

He surprised us with a rice pudding dessert that I absolutely loved. I am definitely coming again. Best Indian food I've ever had, hands down.",

I love Indian food - and haven't had any in a while other than the boil-in-a-pouch variety from Trader Joe's so I jumped at the chance to try a place in town I hadn't been to before. Just pulling up and waiting outside the aroma was so enticing - I could tell good things awaited.  Of course, since we were there for lunch - we got the buffet. As someone who primarily eats vegetarian/vegan I was immediately impressed with the number of veggie dishes offered - and I loved the fact that they separated the meat dishes into a different station all together. Everything I loaded up my plate with was delish!  From the basmati rice, dal, veggie korma, samosas and pakoras - everything was outstanding. The service was super kind and prompt too!  I'll be back - with my husband in tow next time!",

I thought the only way to get my fix was to fly back to the Bay to get it, BUT then I came across this place!  I have probably driven passed this place a billion times before I considered to try it and honestly, it wasn't until I saw the awesome ratings from Yelpers before I decided it was a GO. Boy am I happy I did! EVERYTHING on their menu is so flavorful and rich! My boyfriend and I LOooOoOOOove this place. It's inside of what used to be a Burger King in front of the Mariana's Supermarket. The area isn't aesthetically pleasing, but don't you dare judge a book by it's cover! Their service is hospitable, kind of quiet and shy, but hospitable nonetheless.   Their Mango Lasse is amazeballs. Their chai is alright, probably wouldn't order it again though. The Papadams (spelling?) and the little sauces that get served before you order are so dainty and delicious!   If you ever come for their Lunch Buffet, don't plan on eating for the rest of the day, haha! They have an awesome selection and everything is fresh! We're so excited that we found this place. The boyfriend and I were talking about how we don't know why Indian food has such a negative social stigma when it's actually delicious. But I guess we don't really mind. MORE FOR US! :)",

For an Indian like me, I thought their spice level was medium, not too mild like in other restaurants. They serve Naan on the table, which was hot and soft. Dal makhani could have been better.  The restaurant was also clean and we were served well. I would definitely go once again.",

    "text": "This review is a bit delayed as I visited in January 2013.  We took a cab here from the strip, which wasn't a very long drive at all.  When we pulled up, it looked a little shady.  But some of the best places are holes in the wall, though, right?  When we went inside, it was nice and clean.  White table clothes on the tables and we were seated immediately by a nice man who turned out to be the owner.  The menu has plenty of selection and it was hard just settling on one thing for myself.  I had two other people with me and we ordered the garlic naan, chicken biryani, chicken tikka masala, and lamb curry.  I also wanted shrimp curry, but I thought it best to not let my eyes exceed my stomach.  Our food arrived quick enough and the portions were huge.  We all shared what everyone ordered, as that is how it arrives...typical of Indian cuisine establishments that I've been to.  The garlic naan was excellent and so was everything else.  We ordered the mild spice level on everything, mostly because of my wife.  I could have handled it a bit hotter, but I'm okay with mild.  Everything was excellent.  The chicken tikka masala was the biggest winner of the night and the best I've had anywhere.  It was seasoned perfectly.  The biryani was amazing, too, and I've only had better in one other place (Amber India in San Francisco).  When we were all stuffed, we still had leftovers.  Our drinks were always kept full and the staff and owner were very nice.  The owner offered us dessert but we were simply too full to eat any more.  He insisted and gave us some besan ladoo (I think that's what it's called) on the house!  They were very good.  We were impressed and appreciated the gratitude he showed us.  I'm in Vegas about twice a year or so and this will DEFINITELY be a place I come back to every time I'm in town.",

I didn't think there naan was good, didn't try the sweet rice, and the samosas were overcooked.    Well, wow.  I have been back like, 7 times in the past month since that initial visit.  It is by far my favorite Indian lunch buffet place.  I had 3 in the running but Mt Everest is on top.  First, the price.  I believe it is 10.99... not bad.  Second, the choices.  It has the most choices I've seen!  What could make this place better?  If their labels were more specific.  I love the way some buffets put \"vegetarian\"; as a 75% vegetarian I like a quick reference guide to vegetarian options.  But... with my minor knowledge of Indian food I know what most of their dishes are.  If it were my first exposure to Indian food, however, I would be S.O.L!  Also another thing they could make better.  Their naan.  I don't like their naan.  I like buttery, garlicy soft guusy naan.  This is not my favorite place for naan (Saffron is).  If you like medium-textured, little buttered, barely garlic-ed naan then you would like it.  Other than that, it's so good!   Their choices are amazing.  Final thing (this is the Nutrition student in me):  They are so sanitary!  One of the only Indian buffets I've seen with in-place \"sneeze guards\" on their buffet.  Their buffet is actually buffet style so it has the coverings.  Furthermore, their bathroom has a sanitary spray above the handle.  How great!  So even if nasties don't wash their hands, I won't get their germs from when they open the bathroom door open.  Foodborne illness is no joke, yo.  P.S. Try the sweet rice!    P.S.S. The Bollywood they play on TV is a great compliment to the atmosphere.",

I'd be willing to be a couple of dollars more, it would still be an excellent deal. The decor is nice, nothing special, but it's white table cloth and clean.  The service and attention that your given is excellent. The food is absolutely fabulouso.  The lamb will melt in your mouth, the curried dishes are absolutely delicious and there is a great deal of variety so if your a vegetarian you'll be very happy.  The food is hot and very fresh and Naan bread was quite tasty.  I'll be going back to this restaurant again and again.",

I'm still trying to find an Indian place in AZ that's as good as this one.   If you're a fan of chicken tikka masala, you have to try it at Mount Everest.  It's the BEST that I have ever tasted, and I'm just sad that I have to come all the way to Las Vegas to get it.  It was even better than I remembered and I ate way too much just because it tasted so good I didn't want to stop eating it.  The garlic naan is also delicious.  The service is friendly and attentive, and the location cozy (in a good way).  I wish I could buy the food in bulk and ship it to AZ!    We'll be back, for sure.

The other is chicken dumpling (forgot the name) which was delicious!!!!!!! Their sauce that came with it was also amazing Lamb curry and chicken curry as entree  and I loved the lamb (not much a chicken with fatty person) very yummy sauce.  Desserts. Never ever loved another dessert from diff ethnicity. Pistachio ice cream is sick! Insane taste. And rice pudding delicious.  Wow wow wow.  The only thing I didn't understand is why waiters don't dress the same so you know who is waiter and who isn't.  2nd- the 2nd appetizer came out after 30 min. Maybe it's because the place was busy.  It's my first time trying Indian food and only 2 out of 3 people knew how to explain each order  In other words the food was amazing. The desserts were even better!",

The bad is  chilly chicken (too much oil), goat curry (not much flavor and its hard). I suggest this for good north Indian style food and its definitely  worth the money.",

I went there on a Saturday around 11:00am in order to get in on the Buffet and I found the building was located in bum central. There must have been a dozen homeless vagrants, bums and gangbangers hanging out in the vicinity, I wasn't about to risk having my car broken into or being hassled for spare change. One star for the location, I have no idea about the food.",

The food is just so flavorful, Hot, Abundant, and authentic! (50% or more of the place is full of Indian people eating here... So it must be authentic...right?!)  2. They are on top of filling your water!   3. It's only 10.99 for all you can eat! ALL YOU CAN EAT!!! Come ON!  The owner always recognizes me and I probably come once a month. Some times 2x a week. Or have a dry spell of 3months. It just hits the spot, when you need to get in some great good that is unlike anything else.   Love this place!",

We always get their options of vegetarian curries and the fried rice and garlic naan. The fried rice is ridiculously good with fresh peas, sweet onions, cashews, and raisons. We highly recommend this hidden gem and wish we could give them much more credit than a yelp review because it's always such an amazing dinner and experience!",

I went to both lunch buffet and dinner so I could just write a single review. I recommend going to dinner and ordering everything separately because I felt the food was extremely filling and although the it's only $11, you could only eat so little (1-2 plates). To me, it seemed like the dinner also had a little better quality but everything was still really good. If it's your first time, I recommend going to a dinner first to get a meal that you are expecting and want. I don't recommend the lunch buffet for the first time because the food will not be as fresh or made with quality and that may ruin your view on the restaurant.

    "text": "After a very long night Saturday night, my fella and I woke up around 11:30 absolutely STARVING.   We got up, got ready, and ventured out, neither of us really knowing what we wanted to eat. Our first choice was closed on Sundays (boo), so as we were driving back towards the house, I pulled up my trusty Yelp app, and did a search for nearby restaurants.   Mount Everest was the first one that popped up, and with such a high rating, we decided that since we hadn't had Indian food in a long time, we would give it a go!  We walked in, and were smacked in the face with the most delicious aroma!  It smelled like all the beautiful spices I miss from my Indian friends cooking for me back home in Chicago.   We were greeted and shown to a table, and told that we could go ahead and start on the buffet whenever we were ready.  For $10.99 per person, I thought that the buffet was nice.    Lots of choices!   First round, I tried almost everything...I was a little stand-offish about the goat curry.  I've never had goat before and was nervous, but I did try it second round.   My favorites:  Daal (lentil soup):  really spicy and full of flavor.  Its good on its own or over the basmati rice.  Chicken Tikka Masala.  Uh.  YUM.  Tender chicken in a rich and creamy sauce...mmm. Vegetable Samosas:  Delightful.  Lightly spiced, and delicious.  I went back for thirds of these, and they are really nice with the mint chutney. Naan:  I had hoped for the garlic Naan, but alas, we only got the regular.  That's ok.  It was AMAZING.  My fella's favorite of the day was the naan dipped in the tikka masala sauce.  SO delightful!  I liked the Aloo Baingan (eggplant and potato), but it was just a tiny bit too spicy for me. I found the goat curry very thin/greasy looking in the sauce, and it was honestly hard to get a couple pieces of meat, as there were so many bones.  It was a little fatty for me, but the flavor and cook was good.  I would be willing to try it again.    The tandoori chicken was just kind of \"meh\" for me.  My fella loved it.  I'm not usually a big fan of chicken on the bone though, so I know that had something to do with it.  Service was polite and quick.  Our water glasses were never empty, and we received our naan in a timely manner.  I loved the Bollywood music and videos playing too.    All in all, this was a good experience for me.  It wasn't mind blowing, but I found the food very tasty.  I would definitely return, and recommend it to anyone looking for good Indian Food.",

I've visited other local Indian places, this one is by far my favorite so far.  Really good quality Indian dishes, especially spicy ones, can be hard to find and they go downhill really fast if not prepared with care.",

Being a buffet, that didn't really matter too much, but a little more attentiveness would have been nice.  I saw a review about it being too cold, but when we went, it was super hot and humid in the restaurant... so much that we wanted to hurry and get out.  If it is like that every time, it will definitely put me off of going in the future  Edit:  I've been back for the buffet probably 7-10 times since this initial review and things have been great ever since.  I'm upgrading to 5 stars.  I loooove this place!",

    "text": "Our New Favorite Indian Restaurant in Las Vegas.  We are SO glad we read the positive reviews.  While we can't comment on the buffet, we can say that dinner there was superb.  We started with the complementary papadum.  The mint sauce it came with was thick and spicier than we're used to, which we preferred, and the tamarind was just right.  For an appetizer, we ordered the keema samosas, which are filled with ground lamb, peas and spices.  They were so flavorful.  The shell was crispy, and wasn't covered in salt like we've had at other places, and they were as filled as they could have been.  We ordered 3 plates, which was enough for the two of us to take half home for the next day.  The sauce on the chicken tikka was better than we had in restaurants in London's Brick Lane.  We ordered it at spiciness level 6, and were pleased that it wasn't as diluted with cream as we've had elsewhere.  The lamb vindaloo (level 7) was great.  The lamb was lean, and there was plenty of it.  Nice to find lamb with potatoes, instead of potatoes with lamb.  Sometimes, all we taste is the heat and salt, but this vindaloo was layered with flavors.  Our third plate was baingan bharta.  It was delicious, with complex subtle flavors.  We enjoyed mango lassi with our meal (and took home 2 to have the next day with our left-overs).  They were so thick that our glasses were filled to the brim and the waiter didn't spill a drop.  The service was very attentive, friendly, and professional, without being overwhelming.  We loved that they were playing Indian music - it made a pleasing background, and didn't drown out our conversation.  Even though it's not in the best of neighborhoods, we felt safe.  Our only negative comment is that they use Styrofoam take-out containers, which aren't eco-friendly.  We will definitely be returning soon.",

    "text": "We noticed this place as we were out driving around. We thought it was a drive-through Indian restaurant, which we thought was such a great idea that we had to check it out.  To our disappointment, the drive-through window isn't operational.  Going inside, I expected fast-food furnishings and decor to match the outside of the restaurant.  No way!  White tablecloths and cloth napkins!  Waiters attending to the patrons.  And best of all, fragrant, delectable Indian cuisine - at a $10.00 lunch buffet!  The disappointment of the non-working drive through window was completely forgotten once we experienced the excellent food.  It was so good that we kept embarrassing ourselves, \"mmm!  Mmmma!  Oh my gosh this is so GOOD!\"    Every dish was fresh, seasoned perfectly, not greasy, gamy or too salty.  Occasionally they even changed the food, putting out a completely different dish in place of something that was there before.  The naan was amazing.  I could go there just for the naan.  They offered more, but we had to say \"no thank you,\" because the rest of the food was so good.  The vegetarian dishes were at a separate warming table than the chicken dishes.  This speaks volumes for how they care for their customers, and I'm sure the vegetarian customers appreciate this.  The service was impeccable.  Our water glasses were kept full.  Even the water was good - no chlorine taste.    They didn't bring a check so we paid on the way out.  But that might just be how they do it there, which is fine by us.  We gave the highest tip percentage that we give due to the fine service and quality of food.  We will definitely be back.  This is now officially our place for Indian food.  We just went back again today.  It was every bit as good this time.  And they offered an accommodation for our disabled son without our asking for it, which was very kind.  We'll be back again soon.",

We like Indian food and based on the reviews were looking forward to this place.  It was virtually empty when we arrived, and we were seated immediately.  I mentioned our coupon for $25 off with a purchase of $45 or more.  So we had to eat a lot!  Easy enough!  Our waiter, who I think was also the owner/manager, suggested the Tandoori chicken to start as an appetizer,  Eat a few pieces and take the rest home , which is what we did.  The chicken was that awful red color that you find on most tandoori chicken, but it was very moist and delicious as were the onions and peppers served along with the chicken.  Side note:  We have only had tandoori chicken at one other restaurant in town that wasn't that awful red, and it was the best ever.  But I digress.    We ordered two kinds of naan, garlic naan and lamb filled naan.  The lamb filled naan was OK, but didn't have a real lamby taste, but the garlic naan - OMG  I could have made a meal on just that.  I wanted a lamb dish for my entree and Rogan Josh was suggested, and it was delicious.  Very tender and the sauce was perfect.  Put some on my lamb, the rice and scooped up some with naan.  My husband got a fish curry.  It seemed to me to be very much the same sauce that was on the lamb but with fish chunks in it.  I wasn't crazy about it, but he really enjoyed it. We also had a cauliflower and potato dish that we really enjoyed. I forgot to order raita, which I usually love with Indian food.  We too got a complimentary rice pudding dessert , which unfortunately we were too full to finish.  But it was delicious too, so next time I'll make room for it.  I didn't notice the neighborhood.  It's in a strip mall with a large Mariani's supermarket behind it.  It's not inexpensive, but definitely not over-priced.  While it is number two on our list of favorites, it is somewhat less expensive and definitely closer to home than our number one, so we will definitely be returning very soon!",

    "text": "I'm still a bit of an Indian cuisine newbie, so bear that in mind with my review.  Figured a lunch buffet would be a good way to sample a variety of dishes. The buffet line itself wasn't very large, smaller than anticipated. The standouts for me were the samosas, chicken tikka masala, and goat curry. The goat curry was almost like a very tender beef pot roast. Unfortunately I think the tandoori chicken suffered from being on a hot buffet line because it was extremely overcooked and almost inedible, though you could taste the flavors. It was a bit of a shame.  There was also an eggplant and potatoes dish that was extremely tasty.    Unfortunately I got full quicker than I wanted to, and one plate for me was enough. Though I wanted to go back for seconds of the tikka masala.   Service was efficient, with several of the guys always pitching in to refill waters and take away used plates. Don't know if dinner time is different, but at lunch the employees seem to not wear any uniform and just wear casual clothing. Which there's nothing at all wrong with, but at times it was hard to tell who was an employee and who was a customer.   Mount Everest doesn't look like much from the outside, but inside is some tasty food to be found.",

    "text": "Just got finished eating at Mount Everest for their lunch buffet and I'm literally reeling in pain at my desk.  This opening line would work much better if you couldn't already see the 5 star rating I'm giving them.   Yes, this is that Sushi Mon all you can eat and then some, pants button undoing type of stomach pain, and not the having flashbacks of the Subway employee not washing his hands while making your Sweet Onion Teriyaki chicken sandwich type of pain.  I wish I could describe what I ate in detail, but the truth is I have no idea.  On the first plate I tried everything on the right side of the hot buffet items, which resulted in a plate of rice and an assortment of deliciously spiced veggie and chicken dishes along with some Veggie Samosas and Pakoras.  After a while, sauces were blending into each other, pakora were getting smothered with various other items, left became right, black became white, and soon a harmonious melting pot had been achieved on my plate that rivaled any buffet experience I've had.  With each bite I had no idea which item(s) I were eating, but they were all fantastic.  Some of these bites provided quite a kick and the quickly refilled iced tea and water were much appreciated.  I had no need for a 2nd plate.  I had no room for a 2nd plate.  Someone should have stopped me, but alas, they didn't.   Walking up to the buffet line, the only game plan I had was to try everything on the left side that I didn't try the first time.   Chicken Curry, Chicken something else, Chicken something else.  Done.  Unfortunately I also couldnt resist some more Daal, some more samosas, some more pakora.  3 bites in I knew I was in trouble.  12 bites in I started to hurt.  20 bites in I tapped out.   Now an hour later I'm finally starting to recover...  You may have won the battle Mount Everest, but I will be back to win the war.",

The restaurant is in what looks to be a former Pizza Hut or maybe a KFC and they set up the buffet trays where the cash registers used to be. Despite the former use of the space, they managed to create a very nice ambiance inside, dark and with banging Bollywood songs on the TV. Those were some great music videos and our waiter was very knowledgeable about the actors/signers and movies being shown and was happy to share.   As for the food, as I already said it is some of if not the best Indian food I've ever had, and I'm no novice. I found that if there's  something not  on the menu that you'd like, ask and they'll make it. I'm partial to goat vindaloo which they didn't have on the menu but were more than happy to make. My girlfriend got chicken tikka masala. Both our curries were a 10 (which was a tad  ambitious for her) and the spice was very good. The vindaloo was done perfectly as was the chicken. I've found a lot of places when you order a 10, they just dump a bunch  of cayenne to heat it up, but it was clear it was an across the board spice increase  and you could taste the difference. My girlfriend also had  a mango lassi  and while I'm not as familiar with them as I  am curry, it seemed really really good.   As I mentioned, my girlfriend was  a bit overzealous in ordering a ten and while she managed to eat it, it was still a bit too spicy. The manager  must have noticed she was having issues because he offered  us a free serving of gulab jamun for her troubles. They definitely earn top marks for service as well as food.",

Everything is flavorful, filling, and authentic. I love the pace that they serve your meal. You don't feel rushed and get to have a True dining experience. I can't say enough good things. If you don't know what to order or where to start, ask your server. They are knowledgeable and will find something you'll keep coming back for. Be adventurous!",

    "text": "I knew I had to try this place the moment I opened my car door and all I could smell was the wonderful aroma of curry and other various spices you experience with Indian cuisine. We arrived for the lunch buffet  which runs from 11 to 3pm for $10.99 per person.   They also serve dinner from 5 to 10pm.  For me, a buffet is the best way to experience food you are not familiar with.  Trying to guess what will look and taste good by reading a menu can be next to impossible.     I thought the Everest crew did a great job during my visit today.  The staff was efficient and friendly and it looked like only two people running the front of house of 30 tables or so.   The food selection was a good variety of one side that had all vegetarian options and another with meat offerings.   They featured about 12 different menu items including basmati rice, tandoori chicken, chicken Tikka masala, lentils, and one of my favorites was the pancake like balls soaked in syrup.   All of the offerings were hot and flavorful.   Once again a good reason to experience the buffet is because the food always comes out fresh, hot and often when you have a full restaurant.   Once we were seated the server brought out a fresh basket of Naan bread.  So happy they brought this to the table the bread was hot and had a perfect char on the exterior for extra flavor. Yum! Speaking to server on the way out he said they change some of the buffet offerings daily so you might have a different experience each visit. I plan on going back to Everest very soon and I recommend you try it also.",

We went in early by 7pm on a Wednesday (it was the last week of December though) and the crowd just started to fill in, we were quickly ushered to a corner table that another couple rejected, we were okay with the tight space, the ambiance was decent. the manager was quickly in to take our order. We got the samosas, some garlic naan, the butter chicken, mix vegetables and the veg Biryani. Within a few minutes our server got us some complementary paladums. It was all good till now and now started the wait, it took for ever to get the samosas which were dry and looked old and reheated and tasted as bad, the Naan was good but the curries were nothing special, in fact the chicken was just old dried up tandoori chicken pieces cut up and put in some hot gravy. The Biryani was okay. The only good dish was the dessert, carrot halwa. All in all a pretty forgettable experience owing to the huge delay and the average tasting food. Maybe it was the rush that made our experience bad but as we are from out of turn I doubt we will ever come back again.",

Was at first put off at how slow everything was moving but then suddenly there was a surge of good service which was nice.  Free parking outside the lot and cozy atmosphere with booths. Got some free tamarind and mint chutney with papadum to start which was good. We ordered the bhindi masala (okra dish) and the palak paneer (spinach and Indian cheese) dish with a garlic naan.  It surprisingly came with basmati rice which was nice since we didnt order it. The bhindi masala was really good.  Probably the best one I have had so far.  Full bodied flavor and not slimey.  The palak paneer was tasty. I like that it was too pureed and had some texture left in it.  The garlic naan was dripping with ghee or butter or oil and my friend said it was really good.  It looked liked really good naan.  The rice was kind of hard or old, so not so good. Overall had a nice experience.  And they have huge portions so it was a lot of food for two people and had a whole box of leftovers.   Don't loiter outside if you don't have to.  Seems a little sketch.",

Some come close but there is always something, service, flavor, portions, authenticity that has us saying Everest is still the best. Keep in mind this isn't a fancy joint if that's what your looking for. If your looking for something delicious, rich and comforting this is the place.

Food wasn't hot...just warm enough to eat. The chicken and lamb was dry. They forgot our drink orders and then when they finally did come out, they got our order wrong. The food was just ok...some of it was not edible though. I hate wasting food, so I usually eat it if I don't think it's the best...but some of it, I just couldn't eat because it was either too dry or just didn't taste right. I hate to say it but I would never come back here again, especially since we have found better.",

The outside may not be as attractive as other locations but it's not the location that makes the food taste good, it's the cook(s). You can't judge restaurant just by a buffet as I even managed one of the very most unique restaurants in Ohio. I am a very great judge of Indian cuisine. The chicken tikka masala is amazing and when you ask for hot or spicy and ask for maybe a level 7 spicy it comes that way. There chicken 65 is tasty and basically the way it should taste. The staff provides good service and they are very tentative. The real taste of this unique place is when you order it fresh. Furthermore, a lot of people making reviews are going by very personal taste and may not even know half the ingredients. I have never brought someone to this place where they are not blown away. Especially compared to others that over salt; nothing is worse than over salted take out food or worse buffet food. Also, I love this place even more for the price. In Vegas, it surely does not get better.",

I just can't get enough of the Chicken Makhani (also known as butter chicken), Lamb Korma and Naan bread, SO YUMMY. This place was really great. The flavors were great and very fresh. I agree with all the reviews. I do think the service was a bit slow. It seemed the hostess was also taking orders and closing tickets.  We had a show to go to so we literally had to take the check up to the register to pay our bill. I still don't think I have found a match for the place in Daytona Beach but this is very close......Highly recommended, no complaints or disappointments!",

Chicken tandoori - can be a bit more marinated to have more flavor.  Chicken curry - spot on!!  Veg curries - palak paneer and veg koorma - very good, if you are from India, add a bit of salt for taste.  Dessert  - they had only one dessert(carrot halwa), they made it to perfection. I'd always prefer one dessert with very good quality instead of tasting  5-6 with average quality.  Service - pretty fast and good.  You'd feel satisfied at the end of the meal.   For 12.99$, absolutely worth the money!!",

We went for the lunch special buffet which was only 12.99 per person. I'll say that again 12.99 FOR ALL YOU CAN EAT INDIAN FOOD. I literally engorged myself with DELICIOUS chicken tikka masala until I had my fill. The only thing bad I have to say is that we waited a while for Naan (bread for those who don't know) for them to only bring two pieces out for a table of four. We laughed at how we would divide it amongst the four of us which was kinda of NAAN Sense (insert laugh)!!!! but still it was one small thing GO ENJOY THIS PLACE FELLOW YELPERS.",

    "text": "Indian food, for me, is seduction. The spice aromas alone can transport me to illegal, tiny apartments in Hong Kong where Indian men and women cooked and served fiery curries bursting with coriander, cumin, star anise, cinnamon, turmeric, amchur powder, and on and on. We'd sit in the cramped space and sweat from the tandoor's heat pressing through the concrete walls.  So when Michael and I hit Mt. Everest, the aromas, alone, sealed the deal. We're suckers for lamb samosas. Good sized, these golden brown triangle pastries come out hot. You break open a tip and spoon mint chutney or sweet tamarind sauce on and bite into savory goodness. For me, we indulged in an onion kulcha. This is naan stuffed with caramelized onions and spices. On first bite, I teared up a bit. I hadn't had one that perfect since those Hong Kong days.  My lamb saag was lusty and dense on the spinach, not watered down like some places make it. I scooped up servings with the plain naan. Michael ordered hot, lamb curry. Some places don't mean hot. This place does.  The portion sizes in relation to the cost are more than fair. The quality in relation to cost is top notch. While we were there, I surmised that the cooks and servers were Nepalese. They are, and that's cool because the national flavors add distinctness to many of their dishes. On our second visit, we tried Momo, a popular snack in Nepal.  Fresh, steamed, silky, dumpling skins ferry spiced chicken or vegetables into your mouth - that is after you've slathered on the piquant Momo sauce.  Ok, when busy, things slow down, but that's the price of quality at excellent prices.  Relax. Sip a masala chai. Chat about traveling. Wonder at the smells that seduce you into coming back again and again.",

So I will stick to the lunch buffet.  Still my favorite Indian restaurant in vegas and mint.",

The owner was very courteous and came out personally I check in the tables. Mt. Everest should definitely be a stop for anyone visiting Las Vegas.",

Regardless, they offer classic Indian dishes, from Tandoori Chicken, to Tika Masala, etc. My favorites remain simply their basmati rice; very aromatic, and the Naan bread dipped in Masala. The decor is very basic and service informal but friendly. In comparison to other similar Indian buffets, I would rank this one at the lower end. In sum, if you are tired of bland food and you are looking for something out of the ordinary, this is a decent choice. On the other hand if you know a thing or two about Indian cuisine and are looking to expand your experience or take it to the next level, than this place is not for you.",

The lunch buffet has a pretty decent spread. Being a vegetarian, I sometimes don't have enough options in a buffet but this was different. Pakoras and samosas in the appetizer were nice and had the right amount of crunch. The vegetarian biryani was more of a pulav and lacked salt but was still flavorful.  I would recommend their gajar halwa as well. I usually don't like desserts but couldn't stop myself from eating the halwa here! Overall I liked the place and the buffet is well worth $13.

The chicken momos are my favorite menu item. They are Nepalese dumplings and are unbelievable. The sauce for dipping is so good I even use it on the garlic naan. The Kadai is my favorite of the entrees, but the Makhani (butter chicken) is close behind. Really though, you should try them all and decide for yourself.   Bottom line, don't leave without trying the chicken momos. They take a bit as they are made fresh, but are more than worth the wait!",

    "text": "The usual disclaimer: I have not visited this restaurant. This review is regarding my recent delivery experience.   I love Indian cuisine. I'm no expert on it though; there are a few things I like a lot, but many dishes I haven't tried.  I ordered the Chicken Korma, a tandoori plate, and regular naan. The Chicken Korma was described on their on-line menu as \"mild.\" Now, I generally like spicy food, but I sometimes prefer a mild curry, so the flavors of the spices are present and the protein can be enjoyed. If this Korma was \"mild,\" I'd really hate to think how spicy their Vindaloo is! It was also of a consistency more suited to hummus than to curry. I never got a chance to taste the chicken in the Korma (I usually find myself ordering a curry just for the sauce); the curry itself, while unexpectedly spicy, and thicker than I prefer my curries, was still quite flavorful.  The tandoori platter consisted of some white meat tandoori chicken nuggets; predictably dry, but well seasoned and a great pairing with the tamarind sauce. Also a samosa, which I haven't gotten to yet; some very lovely, moist lamb kebab; and these little fried things which I've never encountered before, but were quite tasty.  The naan, I'm sorry to say, was very dense and a little too moist, possibly because of the way it's packed for delivery. Naan is my favorite flatbread; this fell a bit, well, flat (really, no pun intended!).   I think I will order from this establishment again, but I'll put a request in for the chef to ensure that the mild curry I order is actually mild, and perhaps I'll try the garlic naan, for some added flavor.",

The reason this is not a solid 5 stars is one thing - ambiance. To give a 5 stars I'd like a better ambiance. Don't get me wrong, the place is clean, smells amazing, and plays lively music...it just needs maybe a little something extra for the solid 5th star. We make the drive from Henderson without hesitation to stuff ourselves with the tastiest Indian dishes around. If you are not a local, do not let the neighborhood deter you from going in. Go in! You will not regret it.  The Chicken Tiki Masala, Tandoori Chicken, Palak Paneer, the Chili Chicken, the Vegetable Pakora, and the fresh naan are all amazing every time we go.

    "text": "We were looking for an Indian buffet place for lunch, so a quick search on Yelp threw up Everest India's Cuisine with good reviews so we decided to give it a try. As usual I was skeptical of any Indian place with good reviews but decided to give it a try hoping to be proved wrong. Mount Everest is located on Sahara Avenue not too far from the strip and has sufficient parking so location and accessibility is fine.  When we entered at peak lunch hour on Sunday the place was packed which I took as a good sign. As the restaurant is small and tables are cramped close to each other so seating is very uncomfortable and navigating to and from the buffet is painful as you void bumping into other diners.  The dishes were standard fare that you will find in any Indian buffet. The appetizers included tandoori chicken, samosa and some fried potato dish. Butter chicken, saag, chili chicken and mutton curry were entrees. Then there was steamed rice and dal and lastly gulab jamun and sweet rice for desert.  Taste wise what stood out to me was that every dish was bad. Not just one or two items but everything that I ate was the text book definition of bad Indian food. Tandoori chicken seemed to be boiled and then doused with a lot of color as it lacked any flavor at all and was stone cold. The samosa seemed to be undercooked. The pan fried potato were limp and seemed to be days old. The butter chicken was barely edible. Chili chicken tasted gross and the goat in the mutton curry was undercooked so was chewy (not one person in our entire group could eat the goat). The naan provided at the table was thin and overcooked so it felt like a crispy flatbread. We asked for garlic naan which was better but it came at the fag end of the meal so it was almost useless. The gulab jamun was one of the worst that I'd ever had and the sweet rice was forgettable. I also noticed that there was no biryani in this buffet.  Service was also slow. As mentioned garlic naan was provided at the end of the meal. Plates were not cleared quickly so we ended up stacking them in one corner which made the small table feel even more cramped. Even stacked plates did not prompt quick service and at one time we were scared that the plates would topple over and cause a mess but that did not deter our servers from ignoring them.  At the end of the meal I was happy to be out of this small, cramped, claustrophobic place with terrible food. A sentiment echoed by each and every member of our group that ate here.  Price wise it was $10.99 which is typical for Indian buffet's but what I can't get is the high ratings for this place. unfortunately another Indian restaurant that did not live up to its sky high ratings. Obviously won't make the mistake of returning again.",

    "text": "I love this place. This truly is some of the best Indian food you can get in las vegas. Their lunch buffet is awesome. And the best part is they are not afraid of actually giving some heat to their dishes unlike some of the other Indian spots in vegas.   The food:  Finally some heat with my lunch buffet food. The food here isn't too spicy it has just enough heat to get the job done. You start in the vegetarian section which has some amazing dishes then move your way to the meats. I love the chicken dishes and the goat curry is one of my favorites. You then move onto condiments and desert. Make sure to grab some plain yogurt and chutney to dip your naan into.   Service:   If anything is low just let the owner know and he has them cook it right away. Service is excellent water or soda glasses are kept full. If you come in after they stop cooking for the buffet the owner will let you know when you walk in. He will also ask you to go take a look at what he has out to make sure you would like to stay.   Also don't forget if you are just driving by during the lunch buffet hours you can grab a to go box and load it up for the same price as the lunch buffet.   This place is one of my favorite las vegas Indian food spots. It doesn't quite hit the same level as mint for me but it is up there.",

Watery undercooked goat curry; tasteless chicken tikka masala; mattar paneer with no paneer; gajar halwa that needed more cooking; mint chutney that showed color and water. The only thing that they got right was the food colours :(  The ambience was fine: so it will do well with people who have no Indian cuisine experience and can't tell the stark difference between Indian food and whatever is being served here.   Lunch ended up being palak and naan (both of these were good).",

I suggest this for anyone trying Indian food for the first time, as it gives you a wonderful assortment of what they have to offer! This plate is perfect to share between two people and a level 7 was just the right amount of spice. The NAN bread was also wonderful! We tried the garlic, cheese and plain, all were deliciously perfect. Amazing staff at Mount Everest as well, never had an empty glass and they were very attentive to all of our needs.

The atmosphere inside won't win any prizes but the food passes the test compared to the other Indian options in town. The lunch buffet has some interesting selections you don't see very often, and overall we had a relaxing, tasty and filling weekday lunch here. We'll probably return when we don't feel like going all the way down to Mint.  The lesson: Don't judge a restaurant by its facade. Or its interior, for that matter.",

Garlic naan and tandoori roti were good but we won't order the onion kulcha again. Also, save your money and don't get the aloo tikki appetizer.  The reason I am not giving them 4 stars is because we did not enjoy our dinner experience last Saturday because the service went at a snail's pace and we waited for 40 mins between our appetizers and main courses!! The manager went around asking how everything was, but he had moved on to the next table before he hearing our reply. It was clear that he was doing his job half-heartedly and did not really care about his customers.",

    "text": "Right off, I'm very stingy with giving out stars and I'm not likely to assign any value to the outside of any place.  This restaurant is not much to look at from the outside but is a medium to small restaurant that is pleasantly decorated inside with a friendly staff.  The lunch buffet is served in some of the nicest heated tables (one iced table for the cold menu) with covered chafing dishes.  The food is kept hotter than any other buffet with dishes refreshed regularly.  The one meat table is separate from the vegetable tables, a nice feature for vegetarians to avoid cross contamination.  Every dish was delicious.  Although I would have liked to have one main potato dish (there were potato samosas and a great mixed vegetable dish with potatoes) and would drop up to half a star for the menu selection, the food was fresh, perfumed, and not overly South Indian hot.  The obligatory Tandoori Chicken was both flavorful and moist.  I suspect that the heated tables and covered chafing dishes help maintain the quality of the food.  The pakora were a little crunchy, maybe not perfect, but tasty.  Given that there are no half-stars, the only negatives were not worthy of dropping to four stars considering our overall satisfaction.  We arrived for a late lunch, around 1:30, but the food was great and refreshed before the dish was emptied, keeping the quality up.  The plain naan arrived before we were back from the buffet and I would have liked to have garlic naan, but no one asked.  I guess it is important to ask right away for naan other than plain, but the plain naan was good.  The service was fine with dishes cleared and water refilled, but a little invisible and surprisingly shy.  For any questions, just call out for them -- they really don't want to disturb your meal.  Overall, the fixtures were superior, the dining room was kept clean, and every dish on the buffet was terrific.  Not quite the huge selection found in some of the buffets in Silicon Valley, but it was all good.  Hard to believe that any other Indian buffet in Vegas will beat this spot for quality and value, this is now our go-to Indian restaurant for Vegas.",

When I arrived a few minutes after my friend, we already had a basket of fresh Naan and waters. The naan was fluffy, tasty, crispy, and just so scrumptious.  The selection was awesome!! The dishes that stood out for me were the Basmati Rice, Vegetable Korma (vegetables in creamy sauce), Vegetable Samosa (baked pastry with spiced potato mix), and Tandoori Chicken (roasted chicken marinated with spices). My absolute favorite dish had to be the Chicken Makhani (chicken in creamy tomato based gravy); oh my goodness, it was so, so delicious! Amazing flavor and it went well with EVERYTHING. The naan, rice, and even the samosas! I really liked the samosas as well because the pastry was extremely tasty and wonderfully crunchy. The potato mixture inside was also delightful. We also tried the Chicken Curry and Goat Curry, both prepared with the respective meats, tomatoes, and spices. Good, but overshadowed by the amazing Makhani! The Aloo Baingan (eggplant with potatoes) was tasty and prepared very well, but not something I loved. The last item I tried was the Chili Chicken (chicken with garlic, green chili, and onion), but I didn't like it; plus, it was way too spicy for me.  Service was really great too! Our waters were refilled quickly and frequently. We also received a Naan refill promptly. I was extremely pleased with the whole experience! This is seriously great food and I can't wait to go back!",

It was packed. First, the best boy prepared table for us forks and knives etc.. He was holding our knives from the sharp part( where we cut the meat) with his hand. And  instead of putting them on the table nicely, he actually throw the forks and knives on the table. Napkins and forks knives spoon  all were soppy on the table. It was completely unprofessional service. But it looked he didn't mean doing it. so we accepted it.  Waiters were friendly, they talked to my kids friendly too.It was nice!!  We ordered a chicken curry, tandoori chicken  and samosa. The Curry and samosas were very good! Actually it was really good.we really enjoyed it. But tandri chicken was so so. It wasn't look fresh to me. While we were eating , my husband found little cockroach walking on the wall. I was scared but we tried to tell the waiter quietly. My husband said \"Now, I saw cockroach on the wall. Here you see?\" He looked it and he said with not surprising face \"it is hot in here so..\"  Soooo???? He crushed the cockroach with the curtain on the wall. He didn't wipe and he was just said sorry there is hole in the corner so\" Sooo? I asked \"Hole?\" then he smiled and said \"no, no, it is not big hole  small hole we gonna fix tomorrow\"  as we already ordered chai so we had to drink. We still tried to enjoy the chai but it was so so taste. And I checked the window glass but  there were  any cockroaches but I noticed the window glass looked so oily. I Also noticed the window counter was dusty. The Waiter brought free rice pudding. Actually it was good. My kids loved it. While drinking tea, I was remembering and thinking that  \"When I arrived this restraint, I first checked the bathroom it was not dirty so we decided to eat here. But actually I was so wrong...\"  ...And I came back to the reality from the thinking  And... I saw something moving in my eyesight.Something brown at my napkin on the table witch I wiped my mouth with. Yes, it was another Mr. Cockroach. I was surprised and screamed little big voice. Because Because ... I didn't expected a roach on my table. But with my screaming, No One other table were  looking at me except one couple next to us. The man asked me with serious face  \" what was that ?!!\" I told him quietly \"I saw a cockroach\". And He said \" I knew it I thought I have seen one too and starting to check around his  table.  While we were talking with the man , Mr roach went to on the floor . The waiter came and asked\" Is everything ok?\" I told him about Mr roach was on my napkin. The waiter saw it and stepping on it with his shoe and said sorry to us.  Wow.what a experience!!! They billed 45 dollars and we put 5 dollar tips. We had worst  experience and for sure this is the last time to eat this restraint. I am writing it because I hope every restraint owner are honest. I know some restraint owners are really honest and loving their job hospitality and respectful to customers.And hard worker, clean job and good foods. My questioning is why 600 people are giving 4.5 stars??? So Mysterious!!!",

It is the most authentic Indian food that you can taste. I usually judge the restaurant through their Yellow Dal (Dal Fry) dish as that is the most basic dish. It was simply amazing.  I loved all the vegetarian options for sure.  Would definitely go there If I am in Vegas again.",

    "text": "Another favorite in Vegas definitely the best Indian in town! I've been to the lunch buffet and the a la carte dinner. While the buffet is certainly worth the price I love coming for dinner so that I can order exactly what I want!   The garlic naan is a MUST. And I recommend it with some plain yogurt on the side! For main courses I really love the lamb (or vegetable) korma and the chicken tiki masala. I get both on medium (5) level and it still has a good amount of spice!! I'd say those two sauces are my favorites since I've tried others that are not as memorable to me. I don't love the chicken tikka but probably only because I'm a big sauce girl! I also really enjoy the okra vegetable dish! Full of flavor!  Though the talk of slow service is True I'd say the food is too good to pass up and don't mind the service. I also like to finish my meal with a chai tea at the end. Overall great place eating so many delicious spices just makes me feel very warm and calm on the inside I would definitely consider this \"comfort food\"",

The vegetarian options are delicious. Don't know all the names but I can say that what I ate was definitely tasty. The best dish, however is a toss up between their chili chicken and rice pudding dessert. For very different reasons each dish is Tasty. The chili chicken has heat and a delectable blend of spices. The rice pudding is just sweet enough and a refreshing end to a meal filled with spicy goodness. If you're a fan of Indian cuisine or first timer, I'd suggest you try this place. There is something for everyone. And if it counts for anything, my Indian coworker says Mt Everest is better than mint and India Marsala.",

It was our first time trying Indian food, and I have to say, I do quite like it!  An $11 lunch buffet is a great price. There's a lot of room in there, and there is variety in the dishes from what I can tell. I spooned a little bit of everything on my plate and nearly everything I tried I was a fan of. The naan came, and the garlic naan was as good as everyone on Yelp had said. My friends were also fans of the sweet rice. I think it paired perfectly with the chicken curry.  The service was awesome, too! Being first timers, they were all very helpful. They made more sweet rice for us even when they were around 10 minutes away from closing and didn't hesitate to let us know what the fennel was for by the entrance. Lol. Overall, this place is a great experience for those who want to try it!",

Chicken was dry and overdone. Shrimp was rubbery, and minced lamb was mediocre.   Chicken Tikka masala was bland and watery.   Raita was not well done either.   Naans got for while we waited for the grilled platter so the owner graciously discounted one of my dishes 50%. That was a nice gesture.   The restaurant had terrible service with one untrained wait staff for about 25 patrons on 7 tables.    Overall NOT COMING BACK AGAIN and now you've been fore-warned",

So I will update that later (I hope)  My current S/O loves Indian which is why I discovered thiS Vegas gem..since being introduced to Indian I've decided it is a fun way to eat with people who are open to a variety of dishes.. As stated I can't tell you what you should try and get here because I'm ignorant on this cuisine .. I know from this visit that I love love their chicken Momo.. I also learned some dishes I don't like but that is trial by fire or if you dine here and the manager / server notices a pretty full plate he offers you something else to go which ... Hey  I don't know indian yet but I do feel I am very versed in good quality and amazing service ..  Price wise this place isn't cheap but I didn't find it expensive for what you get , overall it's worth the drive to come to Everest from the north side of town but if you're in the area and want some delicious yum Yum food like the masala or garlic naan check this place out !!! I've only been for dinner so I can't speak for the buffet or lunch service ..",

So, I'm not a huge fan of Indian food. Well that's kind of an unfair statement because it was only my second time trying it. We got here about 1:30 on a Tuesday and it was pretty full which is a pretty good sign.  They bring the naan to the table and who doesn't love a basket full of naan- if you don't, then I probably don't wanna know you because it's a basket of heaven. So please move on from my review. They have a good variety of food, which is fantastic when you're trying to find out what kind of food you like! I wasn't a fan of the tikka masala that a lot of people talk about but I loved the chili chicken! I expected the tandoori chicken or chili chicken to be dry because chicken is dry a lot at buffets, but it was cooked superbly!   The service was pretty good. They're quick with taking the dirty plates and refilling the water - which is so necessary with the spiciness! All in all I'll probably be back!",

Everest India's Cuisine has been serving Las Vegas a wide variety of Northern Indian specialties since 2009, the full dinner menu replaced by an $11.99 lunch buffet 7-days a week from eleven o'clock until 3pm.  Family owned and operated, the space essentially a fifty-seat box with limited lighting thanks to heavy curtains, those entering Mt Everest will pick up the scent of Cumin and Turmeric before even opening the street-facing front door, a staff member tucked into a hostess booth to the right offering greetings while one of two young men offer a choice of seating options.  A simple operation a lunch, Televisions displaying Indian Music Videos providing entertainment above steamer trays containing approximately two-dozen choices, it is with a basket of Butter Naan that the meal starts as diners gather plates and small bowls, the majority of the protein centered around Chicken though a look at the dinner menu shows a much greater variety including Lamb and Seafood.  Admittedly a little underwhelmed by the Naan, the two wedges provided flatter than that found elsewhere and a bit dry when taken on their own, the Bread nonetheless proved serviceable for scooping up tangy Raita or creamy Spinach with small chunks of springy Cheese mixed in, the vibrant orange Rice as fluffy as Basmati with a hint of Nuts and light Sugar that went very nicely with the baked Eggplant and Potato dish as well as the spicier flavors to follow.  Finding Potato and Onion Samosa's downright addictive while similarly flavored Pakora came across a bit too oily, Goat Curry was a welcomed sight that packed a lot of heat around tender bone-in chunks of Meat that proved to be worth the effort, the Tandoori Chicken varying from piece to piece in terms of moistness while the Malai Kofta ate something like big Gnocchi in a base rife with Onions and Tomatoes in a creamy base.  Drawn to the Chili Chicken against better judgement, the fear of indigestion at work looming, it was surprising how well Mt. Everest's Chefs managed to balance the Peppers with pungent notes of Garlic and Ginger, the Yellow Dal scooped up with Naan clearly the source of a lot of the Turmeric mentioned earlier while ubiquitous Tikka Masala featured big slices of Chicken Breast bathed in a sauce milder than many with a notable linger of Coconut.  Finishing off the rest of the Naan with Mango Chutney, the Jelly-like spread also a nice addition to Rice Pudding served room temperature with restrained Sugar, those looking for something sweeter should turn their attention to the hot tray of Gajar Halwa tucked amidst the savory items, the natural sweetness of ground Carrots ramped up by Fruit, Nuts and Cardamom - basically molten Carrot Cake without the flour.  ***1/2Admittedly no expert on ethnic Buffets of any sort, the low prices that attract many raising suspicion about ingredients, Mt. Everest executes the majority of its dishes well while offering a good variety at a fair price, the intrinsic limitations of serving from steamer trays mitigated by a good crowd that sees items replenished frequently.",

The preparation of the meal left me wanting more... I ordered the Goat Koorma level- spicy, which was bland and mild. The pieces of goat were simultaneously fatty and dry.   A co-worker ordered the vegetable samosa appetizer and chicken tikka masala level -mild. She describes the flavor \"as perfectly mild\". I'm not tempted to try another dish here.",

Everything else was either kinda dry or funky tasting. Nothing was spicy either. Usually love getting vegetable samosas at Indian buffets but here it was way too dry. Fresh regular naan was brought to our table warm but turned cold shortly right after if you don't eat it fast enough. Also no gulab jamun (those donut holes/Indian dessert) here :( Only \"sweet\" option was oranges which was disappointing. Not sure if I just came on a bad day. I prefer Mint on Durango (~2$ more but worth it) or Delhi near unlv (same price as Mount Everest) since a lot more options and dessert.",

Not overly fancy it was a decent, comfy place with nice attentive staff.  We were brought yummy pappadum and sauces plus a carafe of water.  We decided on veggie samosa, palak paneer and sheesh kebob.    All were extremely tasty.   The samosa was gigantic.  I loved the whole thing; sherry wasn't crazy about the dough.    The palak paneer was so good!  I could have just eaten it from the serving dish.  It was served with rice.  Great flavors.  We agreed it could be spicier but there is a fine line between spicy and Hell!  We hate to cross it.  The lamb sheesh kebob was very well seasoned and good!  There was a big portion.  Veggies were a bit undercooked for me.  I would tell them to cook it more next time.  But that's me...  They also have a buffet lunch that is like to try.    UPDATE - we had the buffet for lunch today and loved it as I knew we would.  There must have been 10-12 choices plus a couple dessert options and fresh Naan brought to the table.   $12.99 per person.   Well worth every penny.",

Depending on when you go, can taste the difference in freshness.  It's pretty much routine for me, I stick with the tandoori, malsala and pick at the goat meat. If you're here when they open, or course it'll be fire.  They serve each table a basket of naan, so if you want more, you'll have to request it. Everything is pretty much self serve, like your typical buffet. Water is on the table, plates at the start of the buffet bar, so don't expect much service.  The seating is pretty limited. They have booths all around and tables in the center. If the restaurant is packed, expect it to be loud, what can you really expect.   If you manage to have space after eating, pick up some oranges, they are the sweetest :)",

He and everyone who we came in contact with treated us in a welcoming manner, almost like family.  This was the overarching feel of our good experience at the unpretentious Mount Everest India's Cuisine.    We are seasoned Indian food enthusiast and felt some of the tastes of the foods we ordered might have been tweaked for the American palette (some sweeter than expected like Vegetable Kormo), but overall, the food was reasonably priced, top notch and delicious.    The vegetable samosa's were the largest I have ever seen (probably another twist for the American palette) and also more potato than peas, but dough was tasty and dish was hot.  Not the best I have ever had, but good.    Naan, curry, samosa, korma, Taj beer.  These were our dishes and it was a respectable meal that felt welcoming and authentic.  Despite my small criticisms, we enjoyed the non-fancy, local feel restaurant.  The staff are sincerely nice and indeed welcoming.  Although we are not in that area of town all that often, we will make and effort to return.  We enjoyed our meal, portions were large (we took home leftovers), food was hot and tasted good and prices are more than reasonable",

I don't believe reviews of Indian restaurants by non-Indian cause their taste and our taste of Indian food is different.   Chicken tandoori- it was rubbery and feel like yesterday food.  Chicken chilly- it was rubber pieces which I did not eat at all. I cook much better chicken chilly than this Palak Paneer- by look it was like nobody touched it for days. Pakode was good. Mutton was tasteless. How can you cook mutton tasteless? Hardly a thing or two out of 20 things, I liked. Same goes for dessert. In fact, I ate lots of oranges.  Service was again very slow, the server did not fill up the water frequently or took our used plates.   Again not sure how it got good rating across platforms.",

First, they are family owned and take great pride in their establishment. I was here with a friend for about an hour. In that time I saw them bring out fresh dishes maybe 6-8 times. Always making sure the buffet was fully stocked with fresh food. Even if a dish wasn't finished but had been sitting for a while, they switched it out.   Second, there were 2 gentlemen working the dining room, always moving, refilling glasses, bringing out more naan for all the tables, constantly clearing empty plates. They never stood still or sat down, they were always working.   Finally, to say the food was delicious would be a gross understatement. Everything was fresh, hot and so well made. Their Gulab jamun was to die for. Tandoori chicken and different curries made just right. Sweet rice with honey, basmati rice and rice with spices and chicken to go well with every dish. Excellent vegetarian options as well.   Absolutely cannot go wrong with this place and will be going back regularly! Can't beat it! Delicious, affordable, authentic!",

We ordered chicken momos, butter chicken, dal tadka, garlic naan, parauntha. The server was very carefully taking our order, service was good - first came the chicken momos- comparable to one's we get in Delhi (India), came with sauce but sauce was not the typical spicy red sauce but was an orangish sauce which indeed was good. Order arrived pretty quick as well and came exactly per the spice level we mentioned. Dal tadka and naan were good, butter chicken tasted a little too sweet, parauntha was dried out fast. The person taking the order inquired  about  the food thrice which was good. Overall. 3.5",

The butter chicken, lamb tikka and the chili noodles which were all INSANE yummy. The naan is warm and packed with flavor.  Inside the restaurant was small but not packed. Atmosphere was casual with some music videos playing in the background. The employees were all really nice and accommodating. We were here along with a huge party so there was a little wait time but we didn't mind because we took our time eating as well. Will definitely be returning!",

What's great about each of the food items here on the lunch buffet is that each item has its own unique, distinct flavor. A problem that I see with some buffets is that once you have everything on your plate, it's hard to differentiate between each thing because they all taste the same or taste too bland.  Everything from the palak paneer (my personal favorite) to the lamb curry to the chili chicken was absolutely delicious. The best apart this place? They bring you fresh naan that has a nice crispy exterior that is also coated in a beautiful layer of butter.  The service is also really great. Our waters were constantly filled, which is always a nice touch.  I definitely recommend this place if you're in the area.",

The combination of their aromatic spices and decadent smells of the meat are absolutely divine. Indian food is one of those things that you just have to try. Whether you order the butter chicken, the vindaloo, korma, saag, or another multitude of great options you will absolutely not be disappointed. Specifically, I will always order the spinach saag. This spinach curry combines a creamy spinach with a blend of fragrant spices in a result unlike anything else. Pair that with lamb as the meat of choice and your saag is now extremely hearty. Additionally make sure to order the garlic naan to eat with your food. It'll make it that much more amazing. And as a dessert the mango lassi. This yogurt drink is light and sweet and will let your food settle while not over-encumbering your stomach.",

There was only 2 people working so they were busy but at first we weren't sure if we should just get up and start getting food but everyone else did so we followed. We didn't get to pick our naan like we can at Mint but the naan came out quickly and was piping hot. It wasn't too sweet and was perfect to soak up the sauces. I grabbed a little of everything but my absolute favorite was the chicken Marsala. The lamb was a bit too gamey tasting IMO. A lot of the dishes were really salty and there was not much meat left... I'm not sure if it's because we came around 1 or if they don't refill everything as quickly as other restaurants.   My friend ordered a mango lassi and he said it was good but they forgot his order and we received it towards the end of our meal. For the price, the lunch buffet isn't bad and there's a good selection of vegetarian and meat options but I just thought everything was too salty for my taste and I had to dig around for meat instead of bones.",

(f.y.i i even checked before i left to see if it was refilled and still NOTHING.)  service wasn't all that great either. the owner was busy on the phone the whole time, didn't give much attention to his customers.  what was good before WCAP (went cheap after popularity): + we use to be seated and now he just points to a table for use to go to. + we use to get our water refilled without having to ask and now i have to wave down the waiter.  + we use to get the bill brought to the table, now we have to go up to the cashier + the rice pudding dessert use to actually have the consistency of pudding and now its super runny  FINAL NOTE: you can try this place if you've never tried it before, its not horrible but it wasn't what it use to be.

When my husband and I entered for lunch a few days ago, the manager or owner was talking on the phone.  We stood by politely waiting, until he pointed us to sit *with his CHIN* - the phone still strapped to his ear, never once addressing or welcoming us to sit by words!   I was surprised, but didn't say anything.    The restaurant itself was really dark inside, there were no lights turned on at all, just a little natural light coming from the small heavily curtained windows.  Nice surroundings and kind interactions make food taste better in my line of thinking, so this restaurant just failed in these respects.     The buffet itself was fine, nothing was amazing nor was anything bad.  After we sat with our food, the same manager brought a basket of naan and actually TOSSED it down onto our table as he walked by without even making eye contact with us, still jabbering away on his phone.   My husband and I just looked at each other and laughed, it was that bizarre!  Needless to say, I will not be going back.  There are other Indian buffets in town that serve great food, have an inviting ambiance and treat me like a valued customer.",

Everest. Prakash and the fellas serve up some of the tastiest Indian cuisine I've ever had.   don't let the neighborhood (it's quite safe) or the former pizza hut exterior deter you, as soon as you walk inside it feels like an oasis. and the delicious smells of curry and tandoori greet you.  the chicken tikka, served sort of fajita-style, was tender and delicious, and spiced to perfection. the saag paneer, one of my favorite indian dishes, was savory and so inviting that i kept going back to it as i \"filled in the corners\" at the end of the meal, when i'd already eaten too much. we also had their lamb curry which was not a ground lamb curry but featured a generous portion of cubed lamb shoulder perfectly cooked and tender.  this is my new go-to spot in this ridiculous town.

I have been here for Buffett and it was pretty good with a very nice lamb curry. Tonight we are here for a take out. Unfortunately we waited for over 30min for our food. Like all Indian foods, the potions are surprisingly small during dinner specially if you are used to Indian buffets. The quality of the food is good. Overall I rather go to Indian when they have Buffett.",

Lunch time prices are reasonable and the establishment got pretty busy within minutes after opening. Good sign! My wife and I were impressed with the selection from the saagaloo, to the chicken tika and tika masala. This restaurant is about 2 miles west of the strip near Palace Station Casino (The Casino where OJ finally got arrested). This Indian restaurant as well as Taj Palace, located in Henderson, are my two favorite Indian restaurants.",

Seems like it's made out of leftover samosas.  We also got raita which was good but a little tarter than I like. The garlic naan was yummy.   For main courses we had prawn biriyani and mateer paneer. The prawn biriyani was tasty though the rice was on the al dente side. The matter paneer had a nice sauce.   The dinner was good overall, but there are better Indian restaurants in town.",

It wasn't too far from home so we made an evening out of it. At first we found it interesting how the restaurant seemed like a renovated Burger King but that didn't matter as at least the building was being re-used instead of sitting empty or knocked down.  We were taken aback by how wonderful the food was. The Lamb Saag, Chicken Vindaloo & a vegetable dish is always our main staple. Every time we go in the owner (I think it's the owner) Prakash greats us and recognizes us. It's very nice to know he cares about his guests and treats them with respect and makes us feel special.  We've tried several other Indian establishments, and although they are good and offer a nice experience we always seem to compare them to Mt. Everest. I guess when the bar has been set high it's hard for others to compete with quality. Well done Mt. Everest, you have loyal guests for life.",

BUFFET ITEMS:Vegetable korma, yellow daal, chana masala, vegetable samosa, sweet rice, basmati rice, vegetable pakora, chicken tandoori, chili chicken, chicken makhani, chicken curry, goat curry and the BEST part was that they had my favorite GULAB JAMUN!!   The chicken curry was very flavorful, it had a great balance of creaminess and spices. It also contained big chunks of chicken which is what most people tend to skimp on (abundance of protein is always a plus in a buffet dish). I was surprised that they had goat curry (gamey stuff is not my cup of tea so this one I did not try). The gulab jamun were little balls of perfection.   SERVICE: our server was very attentive and quick to refill our glass of water.  I subtracted a star b/c although the gulab was legit, they only had the gulab and rice pudding for dessert. There was no mango pudding or the carrot halwa the sweet carrot dessert, but I guess you can't have everything. I also wasn't a fan of their naan that they offered. A good naan has a little bit of crispiness and SOME flavor. This NAAN HAD NO FLAVOR whatsoever and was very thick and heavy. It was more of a PITA than a NAAN.                     For $10.99, I would come again.",

    "text": "After talking about Indian food with Doriee D and Andrew C we decided to check this place out the next day for their lunch buffet which runs from 11 am to 3 pm daily. I usually like to order off the menu at places like this but for some reason it seems like Indian places in Vegas prefer to do buffet only for lunch. After seeing a bunch of positive friends' reviews of this place we figured it was a fairly safe and solid choice  Given the time we arrived, I'd say the buffet was still fairly full since the lunch buffet ends at 3 pm, however, we never saw it refilled while we were there. On my first plate I tried a little bit of everything which meant I had a pretty full plate to work through. The stand outs were the curry chicken, tandoori chicken, and chili chicken, which had a little kick to it. The veggie samosa and sweet basmati rice were ok...and are probably an acquired taste. Fresh naan was brought to our table and it was warm and delicious! Not burnt, old, or cold like some other places. After the first plate I was already pretty full and just got seconds of the chicken dishes I liked.  We wanted to try their milky balls =P for dessert but they were all gone by the time we were done eating so we had to settle for the sweet rice pudding instead, which I believe is called kheer? For $10.99 for an AYCE buffet the food was decent and I would come back the next time I have a craving for Indian food.",

While I waited I was given water and poppadoms which kept me ticking over until my main meal arrived. Even though I was alone I was given a booth and made to feel at home despite the restaurant being crowded.   I ordered lamb biriyani, keema, plain rice and garlic naan. Everything was amazing! It was far too much for me alone but I like to take leftovers home for the next few days. The biriyani was particularly flavorful and with lots of meat which is lovely! It's really hard to find keema in the USA at restaurants and this was a treat for me so I added as an extra... Tastes wonderful and authentic! And the portions are an excellent size.   I had both rice pudding and gulab jaman for desert and both were delicious. It's really unusual for me to be so pleased with every aspect of the meal, but this was above and beyond what I was expecting.   The restaurant is clean and tidy and the staff are kind and attentive to your needs. The owner, Prakash was very keen to receive feedback and see if there was anything he could do to improve my meal. There wasn't! It was really a perfect meal and I'm a curry snob / takes a lot to please me!!! Oh before I forget I highly recommend the garlic naan! Very fresh and fluffy and tastes just like it should.   I will be a regular customer, I am pleased to have been recommended!!",

The restaurant seems like a family owned business and the customer service is wonderful!! They are super nice, friendly, and seem easy to get their attention if you need anything. There's also a TV playing in the corner with current Indian movies with plenty of bollywood dancing and hip current Indian music.    The usual dishes we order are:   - appetizers: vegetable pakora and samosas, thinly spiced cracker (don't know the name of it - sorry)  - main dishes : tandoori chicken, palak paneer, chicken korma, chicken makhani, lamb curry (rogan josh)  - sides: garlic naan and rice  The appetizers are very tasty and a good size that come with a mint jutney sauce and a spicier sauce.  All the main dishes are very good also.  Warning though, if you ask for spicy... these dishes can definately make you sweat like a banshsee!! just ask my bf!! I like them milder and ask for mild or a level \"3\" and they are delish.  Maybe \"5\" or higher will be too spicy and possibly not enjoyable... but up to one's palate.  The tandoori chicken comes out on a sizzling plate and the chicken is so tender and tasty, always a safe bet.  The chicken makhani (butter chicken) is my absolute favorite! The korma and curry are pretty rich in spices and have very distinct flavors to the dishes.  I think the palak paneer is alright but reminds me more of creamed spinach - so maybe a pass.    This place is small and cozy but usually hopping with customers.  The food may come out a bit slower when they are busy but it's worth the wait.  Always happy with the food and service here that makes me keep coming back for my Indian food fix!!  I really need to come for the lunch buffet which looks like a great deal for the same food.",

Specified a spice level of 5/10 for my 'tikka and order was out in 10 minutes flat, with a large side of basmati rice.  Chicken tikka masala was a good size for the $13 price tag, which included the rice. Garlic naan was worth the upcharge: delicious, soft, and flavorful, with a garlic scent that wafted through my car as I drove home.   My disappointment came when I finally tried my entree. For a spice level of 5, I tasted absolutely no spice. And the sauce had a sweetness to it that I am not familiar with. It wasn't necessarily bad, but the dish didn't have the kick to it I was craving.  Chicken in dish was in large chunks, sauce was a smidge on the thin side.  Based on other reviews, I'm going to have to come back for the lunch buffet and reevaluate.",

Of note, the dishes used good quality cuts of meat (no nasty gristle surprised when you chomp down), service is good, and the flavors in the dishes are great. The only negative thing I can come up with is that the naan bread is a little \"bready\" for my liking.  I'll definitely be back and would recommend it to new and old Indian food eaters.",

I often find that single diners don't get the same quality of service as larger parties - I've always thought that this is due to the lower expected tip - who knows.   In this case I ordered an appetizer, soup, and main course, but the soup came out first and while I was about 3 spoonfulls into the soup, the appetizer and main course arrived.  Of course, by the time I got to the main course it was cold.  When the manager visited the table to ask me how things were, I told him how the food had been served and his response was to smile and walk away.  Otherwise, the service was prompt and pleasant.  I had lamb filled samosa for appetizer which was overcooked and the meat dried out.  The Dahl (lentil soup) was watery and tasteless, and the $12 dish of lamb curry had about 7 small chunks of meat hidden in a lot of sauce.   For $2 extra I got about 2 tablespoons of chutney and another $2 for an equal amount of spiced pickles.  The best part of the dinner was the onion stuffed naan.  Mount Everest could be mistaken, both inside and out, for a fast food joint, except for the white cloth napkins and tablecloths.  Again, if 3 stars means A-OK, then this place should be 2 1/2 stars for Just OK.",

    "text": "After having a first bad experience with Indian food many years ago, I was a little hesitant to try Indian food again.  When my family came into town, they were craving Indian food.  As driving around the neighborhood, we happen to come across Mount Everest. This was my first trip to an Indian restaurant in Vegas since living here. Upon arriving, we were greeted with quick and prompt service. All the workers there were very kind, and quickly assisted us with whatever we needed.  We tried out their lunch buffet.  My family knew what they wanted to eat, I, on the other hand, was taking my time as to not knowing what I was eating nor I didn't know half of what the dishes were.  So, I kept it plain and simple and had the chicken tendoori, basmati rice, and also tried their stew.  All was good.  My family enjoyed each dish they got and loved every meal they ate.  I came back again the second time around this time with a friend.  We actually both enjoyed our meals.  I kept it simple again, ordering the usual, the tendoori chicken with basmati rice.  My friend ordered some chicken curry dish also with rice.  We both had the plain naan and it was very good.  My friend and I would come back again to Mount Everest and perhaps try other dishes that they have to offer.",

We wanted to order from menu and we were told there is a 15$ minimum per head including kids for ordering.  This is after the waiter asked us if we wanted to order, owner/manager came and told us that there is such a minimum and thats why they provided buffet(kind of telling us we cant afford 15$ per head luxury of ordering from menu).   So if you are desperate for food, go here.",

    "text": "Used a Groupon deal here. Wasn't sure it was good for the Thali, which if you go to an indian restaraunt is your best deal. You get a bit of everything. Like previous reviewers, this place is owned by Nepalese. When you drive up it looks almost like it is dark, not open from the outside, but I think thats because of the glare stuff they have on the windows for the heat during the day time. The service was great. We ordered a vegetarian Thali and I ordered the Mt. Everest Thali, which came with lamb, tandoori chicken and butter chicken, along with the vegeterian options. Normally at other indian restaurants I never get appetizers with the Thali. This came with the usual Paperdums, which had both mint chutney and tamarind chutney, which was made fresh you could tell.  In addition to that we got pakoras, fried califlower, and appetizers size chicken pieces and lamb. Ours came with dessert. Rice pudding and Gulab Jamman. The best we have had thus far. The Gulab was nice and firm and the syrup was thick not watery like I normally have experienced.  We also ordered chai. It came in a big 32 oz cup, like a take-way, and was made fresh because it was pipping hot. My boyfriend wanted to go back the next day just for the tea! Highly highly recommend this, especiallyif you know your indian food, much better than Tamba on the Strip.",

    "text": "It was a fluke that my friend and I passed by Mt. Everest in search of a quick lunch after visiting the salon. We passed by Chinatown because she could not eat anything in that vicinity.   Running short on time we were not able to get to our original destination. While on Sahara we passed by this place and good thing because my heart was set on Indian. Seeing that most of my friends has written so highly of this place, it was worth giving a try. For $10.99, the lunch buffet is one amazing deal.   I wasted no time, got a plate and created a mountain that would give Everest a run for its money. Saag Paneer will always be my favorite. I spooned some onto my plate and was elated with the large cubes of cheese swimming in my spinach. The sweet rice can be eaten on its own as a dessert like the similarly florescent orange rice found in Vietnamese eateries or used to balance out the spice in your favorite curry. I ate it with my meal and it contributed a nice contrast to everything else on my plate. The Aloo Gobi was seasoned well, but did not have much cauliflower. The Goat Curry was tender and did not possess the gaminess that people normally complain about. The stew did contain many small bone. I spent some time picking through to be safe. The tandoori was dry on the outside and moist on the inside. I have never seen that before, so it was not a total bust. If there was an aspect to complain about, it was that I was not at the table to order garlic naan. Plain naan just doesn't do anything for me anymore. The Gulab Juman are delicious, but more than two of these fried milk balls and I am sure to become diabetic.",

Some saag carries the spinach flavor a little too heavy, but here it is beautifully spiced. Plus, they have no problem preparing roti for us. Buffet bliss!",

We were craving for some Indian food in Vegas and decided to try here. From the outside, it didn't look that inviting. But once. we were in, the service was awesome.  Every food we ordered was authentic and to our taste. Tandoori Chicken is one dish that I am usually never satisfied in most Indian restaurants in the states. But the tandoori chicken here just rocked, it was juicy, scrumptious and perfectly cooked. Just like the clay oven cooked chicken in India.We love it.  The host was generous in proportions and very friendly.  Its a little gem in vegas.",

It's the food I used to eat at home and not like the restaurant food other restaurants serve. The food at Everest is simple and delicious. You can taste how fresh the ingredients are. The chutneys smell and taste of cilantro - which is only possible if it's made fresh.   Their naan is the best. Make sure to order it.   I can't say more about the restaurant other than - if you are in town, give Everest a try. You'll love it.",

    "text": "The best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas. Period. The highlight is the delicious garlic naan bread and the host's friendly and quick service. The food is well-prepared especially the Palak Paneer and Tandoori Chicken with just the right amount of spices and seasoning to bring out the heartiness and flavor of the food. Mt. Everest is buffet style which also means you can't beat the value it provides in terms of variety and price for the amount of dishes they offer. We loved the garlic naan so much we ordered it to-go, but our awesome host gave it to us gratis for being first-time diners. We'll definitely come back and let our friends and family know about this hidden gem in Las Vegas",

I snuck away during NAB for vegetable jalfarezi and tardka dal. My request for real spice was met with a query of \"1-10?\" And my '8' was prepared with subtlety and real appreciation for the spices, as opposed to a crude bath of chiles. Everest is worth the cab ride. The staff is attentive and kind in the Nepalese way. I would definitely categorize this an off-strip gem in line with the (pre-renovation) Lotus of Siam: great food prepared with care and passion.",

The chicken tikka masala is perfectly creamy filled with chunks of juicy chicken that give a strong beautiful punch to excite your taste-buds. The meat to sauce ratio is great, you literally have meat in every bite.  Palaak Paneer is thick and creamy filled with slightly crisp chunks of paneer to accompany every spicy bite. I know a lot of places have issues with over and under salting this dish but honest this is probably the best i have had in a long time.  Vegetable Korma had a yogurt taste to is making it super delicious. I really enjoyed how the curry for this was not too tomatoey in taste but more of a orchestra of flavors each playing there part.  The naan is hot and fresh offering garlic and regular. I would recommend and come here again when in town.  seriously the most cleanest establishment to date and such a friendly staff.  ++huge plus++ hand sanitizer and lotion at register :)  stay hungry folks",

I wonder what that says about me....maybe it just proves how big a foodie I am. :D  Was in the area looking for some desi food, Yelp suggested Mount Everest and off we went. the server was polite and friendly, and helped us decide what to order. I ordered the mango lassi, naan, Chicken Makhani and the Paneer Tikka Masala. All the dishes were really good, and the Paneer was really soft, and not chewy (unlike a lot of Indian restaurants). The highlight of the meal, however, was the Chicken Makhani. If you've tasted the Butter Chicken in Old Delhi (around Red Fort), this is as close to it as it gets, here in the US. Just the memory makes me drool. :P I will make it a point to go back on every visit to Vegas, for the Butter Chicken alone.",

I had the Chicken Tandoori. Both plates were amazing! The Bread we ordered was Kabouli Naan and garlic Naan. My buddy had a Mango Lassi for his drink. The Rice Pudding finished us off. Mount Everest is completely deserving of its Yelp standing. Indian food now is at the top of my list right next to Vietnamese. I can't wait to return the next time I'm in Vegas.

We reach there and as we try to push the door open, the door pushes back !! After a couple of minutes of intense trying and my worst Hulk imitation the door yields and we see a huge crowd in front of us. Just like back in India:(   We wait for a few min to see if there is a chance to give our name to someone and then decide to order takeout. We suspected that the take out would be sooner than waiting to be seated. It's a small place not equipped to handle the crowd. People ended up waiting next to others table mentally wishing them to Finish soon so we can grab their seat!  We placed our order and got it about 90 min later. The chili chicken was average. The samosa had the distinct flavor of being refried. The oil from the veg noodles dripped out in the plastic and the chicken biryani was palatable.. Barely. For good measure they threw in some cut onions and lemon just before we left that was previously refused by a customer!  Now I understand why they call it Mount Everest. The effort needed to get in and eat the food with the ambiance provided makes the name quite apt. Wish Yelp had a no star option :/",

Indian food is like Thai food to me...the more spicy it is, the better it tastes!  You get much more flavor and depth in the curries and misc, so it's much more enjoyable!  And the Garlic Naan of course! The most \"garlicky\" I've had...so much flavor...yum!  I think we ate three baskets while we were here LOL.  Super cheap prices...gonna be hard to beat at only $10-11!  Weeeee  Pics :",

We had Bhajia, tomato soup, Bhindi Masala, Daal Makhani, Vegetable Noodles, Biryani, Mango Lassi & Salt Lassi. Yes, we over-ordered!!! :P   The portion sizes were good & were enough for our dinner & lunch for the next day. The Bhindi Masala, Daal Makhani, Bhajia, Mango Lassi & Salt Lassi were very delicious. Would give a 5 star for them. The tomato soup didn't meet our expectations & the Vegetable noodles were too thick.  So wouldn't rate them as high.   The owner was very helpful & hospitable. The orders arrived quick enough and we don't recall waiting too long for any dish. Over all, all the customers looked pretty satisfied and happy.   Would definitely recommend this place to any friend!",

The exterior doesn't shout yummy Indian food; but the interior was nice and clean. I always check the restroom to see how well it is maintained before dining somewhere. It also was quite clean. There are booths against the walls & windows with round  tables in the center. There were several families and a few couples dining.   What I really noticed was that everyone seemed to be having a good time and the conversations from the other tables could not be heard from where we were sitting. I thought that was a plus because you could have a private conversation or laugh at jokes without disturbing anyone else. They did an excellent job at seating their customers throughout the restaurant.  All in all, we were impressed with the quality, portions and price of the food. For starters, you get a basket of papadum with two little dipping sauces. We ordered Lamb Vindaloo (classic spicy lamb w/potatoes), Chicken Jel Frenzi (chicken with bell pepper, onions, mushrooms in sauce), Aloo Kauli (potatoes & cauliflower), and two orders of naan (garlic & keema/lamb). The dishes had wonderful sauces with excellent consistency for sopping up with naan. Everything was fresh, hot and yummy.   The service was good. The waiter never let our water glasses get empty. And the food came out as ordered in a timely manner. I will definitely put Mt. Everest at the top of my list for non-franchised Indian dining.",

The selections were somewhat limited, but the food was pretty good.  They bring naan to the table.  Those who have eaten at other Indian buffets know that this is a nice touch, because it seems that you always have to wait and fight for the naan if it is on the buffet line.  The workers were friendly and efficient with water refills and plate removal.  Strangely though, they did not come to refill the soft drinks.    Like I said, this used to be a Burger King.  With that being considered, the decor was nice.  The white tablecloths are a nice touch.  The parking situation can be a bit dicey as it is located in front of a busy market.",

The bottom line (in case you don't wanna read on): food so good we came here 2 days in a row.   Don't let the neighborhood scare you. Only a lil sketchy. The food is spectacular!! Best Indian food we ever had. EVER. we tried the Mt Everest thali which was plenty of food for 2 big eaters. The naan is yummers- both plain and garlic. Even the lamb, which I'm pretty picky about was so tasty. Not gamey at all. Our favorite dishes: chicken tikka masala, saag paneer.   We came back for the lunch buffet the day after. I highly recommend it if you like variety and don't really know the names of the dishes. There wasn't a single thing we didn't like.   Not only is the food amazing but service is great. Prakash is a great host.  We will be coming here every time we come to Vegas.",

Prices are very reasonable: $8.99 and the selection is pretty extensive. There were at least 4-5 different vegetarian currey options and 3 different meat options.    All the food was very fresh with tons of flavor. You're instantly smacked in the face with all the different aromas of the Indian spices as soon as you enter the restauarant. The service was also great. My water glass never got more than half empty before someone was by to refill it. I was very impressed.   I think my favorite part of the whole experience was the Naan basket. They give you a basket of what looks like toasted pita bread, but it's so much better! It comes plain and with garlic and WOW the garlic naan was SOO good. I could probably just sit there and eat that all day.   Overall, this was a good first experience. A little overwhelming since I didn't know what half of the food was, but it all tasted delicious.",

First, the price is great at under $8 for the lunch buffet. The manager and staff were very nice and attentive. We were seated right away, so no wait around 12pm.  I tried everything, the chicken curry, chicken korma, veggie korma, palik paneer, dahl, soup, rice pudding, etc. with a hot Indian chai.The veggie korma was very creamy and seemed even better than the chicken, though the chicken was really good. This isn't diet food and we had a very light dinner since we were full all day. I saw some people get the buffet to go, which seemed like a good idea. At $8, you meet or beat the price of most other lunch spots.  Other stuff: chai was as it should be. Nothing super special, but I'd order again. The garlic naan was different, but we prefer regular naan. The garlic changes the flavor of the food too much. Regardless, it's nice having warm, fresh naan brought to your table instead of having it sit on the buffet .   Due to our complete, total satisfaction, the price and friendliness of staff, I'm giving a rare 5 stars.",

My craving for the Indian buffet had not been satiated by my visit to Mint and so I was determined to have a good experience today.   After extensive research on Yelp I decided to try Mt. Everest. A co-worker of mine agreed to join me (ditching his diet) thanks to the fact that Shari S had described the Naans here as being \"billowy.\" We made the long 10 mile trudge to Mt Everest from the office.   This buffet is seriously amazing. For a little tiny place charging 8.99 per person, it seriously hit every craving and made us happy campers. There is an extensive vegetarian selection in the buffet: soft Basmati rice with peas, Palak Paneer, Punjabi Kadi, Malai Kofta, Dhal, Cauliflower and Potato Stirfry, Sambar, Idly, Samosas, Pakoras and a myriad of chutneys, yogurt, salad and dips. I have only good things to say about every single dish on the buffet. Tasted good and the ingredients were all fresh. Indian buffets frequently omit primo dishes like Paneer (indian cottage cheese cubes), Kofta (indian dumplings in gravy), Samosas and fresh (not frozen) veggies in their food. Mt. Everest did no such thing...they spared no expense and made this buffet experience fantastic.   My co-worker who eats meat couldn't stop raving about the creamy Chicken Makhani, Lamb Curry and the Samosas (he went pretty crazy with all the chutneys).   And yes, the garlic naans that came with the buffet (we asked for garlic) were billowy. And extremely tasty.   My only gripe with Mt. Everest is the dessert selection. They had sweet rice...which really is a cop-out dessert. But I settled for their fresh fruit selection (oranges and watermelon). I would give these guys a 4.5 stars (taking off a half star for the dessert) but since I can't on Yelp, they get a four. Next time, if they serve Gulab Jamun I will be more than happy to up it to a no-questions asked 5 star review.  It's truly heartwarming to see an Indian buffet keep it's quality consistent even after being open a while. Mt. Everest really did warm my heart and brought back some of my lost hope in the Indian buffet genre in Las Vegas.   Thanks to all the Yelpers that did a wonderful job describing this place. You guys were spot on!",

The reviews were great.   I was one of the first ones in that dinner time at the restaurant.  Checking this place out why they have Mount Everest all over he place.  Mmmm thinking to my self maybe they like that place. I knew it was part of China the big country but learning something new. It was also part of Nepal - a country just above India.  I had many question about the food they served and why it's not Indian Food. Finding out that Nepali's are very similar food of Indians but some of them look a bit Asians.  I asked the server and he told me that some food would just have a bit twist but other then that it's the same.    I asked the server what's good to eat and he recommended me to try out a dish that had a varieties of different types of Nepali food. It was priced $$ right for the fact that you get a sampler first, 3 small dishes, pita bread, and rice.  After you think your done they ask what type of dessert you would like to eat and they have many different types of dessert that I never knew.    When I was done they also had this different type of breath mint that cleaned your mouth.  Very different from American style were we just get a mint candy and tooth pick.  It was like a tea seeds with other types of seeds and they add a mint flavor and it works like the mint but I guess better.     I really had a great experience at this place for the fact I've never knew a lot of history and new thing.",

The buffet here is VERY vegetarian friendly, generally with 4-5 vegetarian options and 3-4 meat options. I very much like the paleek paneer and the daal. The meat options are general goat curry, chicken curry, chicken tikka masala, and chili chicken. The chili chicken is my favorite, its slightly friend with delicious chilis!!!

We ordered cheese naan, lamb biryani ( make sure to tell them how spicy you want it cuz it can be very very spicy) it was good, chicken curry taste okay but I think it lacks something like d flavor and aroma of a curry.  We enjoyed d foods and d mango lassi, this is a must try! Plus d in charge was super accommodating, friendly, knowledgeable, and really good with customer service that u will feel at home! Plus the staff are also nice and helpful.  Kudos to the owner of this restaurant, because of your staff that are super helpful plus the in charge, which we forgot to ask the name, but he is from Nepal: They have lunch buffet which is from 11am to 3pm at $10.99.  At d end we paid a minimal amount of $41 plus, good offer huh. So if you guys are craving for some Indian food and affordable, I will suggest Mt Everest.",

As for the food - We ordered pretty much everything they had to offer:  Chicken Masala - Not the best in town, but good  Chicken Tikka - Very good  Lamb Josh Rogan - Very good  Garlic Naan - Fire  Biryani Chicken Rice - So good  We ordered a few other curries, I forgot the names.

The restaurant itself is nice and the owner and the customer service here is pretty amazing.   Not sure if they were having an off day, but the food was okay! Nothing out of ordinary. My parents weren't too happy. I don't think it's fair for them to compare to the food they get in India. But, I too have had better food in LA and North California. I wasn't happy with the appetizers (samosa and pakora) it lacked good flavor. I think overall the vegetable korma, spinach and mixed vegetable was good. Chana masala wasn't that great. They brought fresh naan to the table and that was soft and tasty. The absolute disappoint was the dal! It wasn't quite done. I could see the whole lentil and it had no taste. I think the gajar ka halwa and rice kheer was ok! They did have other non vegetarian options which maybe the reason this place has such high reviews!",

After that we visited this place once again because we wanted to grab quick lunch - and it was a complete letdown. The two stars that I am giving are for the fluffy and warm naan bread that they serve and the decent service. But that's about it. The lunch buffet was bad. No second thoughts about it. The chicken tandoori was the driest that I ever had. The chili chicken tasted like it was from a bygone era. The whole non veggie menu tasted like it was recycled. The veggie courses were poor as well - everything tasted like it was half cooked or made with quantity in mind.  So - I can probably say this - stick to A'la carte menu. Avoid the lunch buffet at all costs.",

We had delicious vegetarian momos with a fragrant sauce, chicken kadai (which was a first for us) and delicious, plus a unique variation of malai kofta with a rich and creamy sauce that begs for your naan bread.  Prakash took great care of us along with his staff and even brought us complimentary dessert.  I highly recommend this place and don't show too much bravado on spice, a \"7\" was the perfect heat for us and we usually go \"8\" or \"9\" at most places.  Enjoy!",

It can get very busy very quickly, but wait times are reasonable and worth it! They have classic dishes like spinach with cheese, goat curry, chicken Tikka masala, chicken curry, lentils, vegetables, chickpeas, tandoori chicken, chili chicken, samosas, pakoras, so much stuff! Naan is cooked to order and water glasses are always full. They don't charge for our 2 year old, even though she eats a plate with various items, and we love them even more for that. Glad to support this family restaurant, and recommend it highly!",

Their butter chicken is the BEST! And their chicken curry is awesome also.  And they serve you fresh naan with the buffet.

The flavors are all there, but it's not as expensive as many other Indian restaurants in town that I find to have less appealing food.  As far as buffets go, their lunch buffet is excellent. They always have several of my favorite Indian dishes available and they keep the warm, fresh, pillowy naan bread coming. The only problem I have is that I overeat every time I come here for the lunch buffet.  Last night was my first time trying their dinner menu, and it was so delicious. We started with vegetable samosas which were cooked very well. The had a perfect crisp on the outside and beautifully seasoned potato filling inside. Then for our entrees, I ordered Lamb Vindaloo and my wife ordered Chicken Kurma, and we both ordered garic naan to go with it. (Unlike many other Indian restaurants in town, Mt. Everest doesn't charge extra for rice. I very much appreciated that.). The Lamb Vindaloo was the best I've had. So flavorful! The Kurma was very tasty, but a little too sweet for my tastes. My wife loved it though and couldn't stop raving about it the entire meal. She's already mentioned to me how much she's looking forward to eating her leftovers.  Somebody in a previous review seemed to think the fact it's in a building where a Burger King used to be, and in a predominantly Hispanic neighborhood is a bad thing. Me? I don't care where it is or what used to be there as long as delicious food and great service provided. This place has both.   The owner even brought us out a free rice pudding for dessert for us to try. I don't think that's standard for all guests, but it was delicious. I would recommend Mt. Everest India's Cuisine to everybody.",

The worst part is the staff of this restaurant. They do not know to interact nor they know to take care of the guests. You have to wait in the queue to get the table and no one responds well except the owner. They don serve good and hardly care for the queries of the guests. I am an Indian and i feel ashamed when this kind of attitude is shown to the customers because not even in India you will come across such rude behavior from the staff in any restaurant.  I read reviews which said this place is very good and amazing for indian food. But my opinion is do not visit unless if your left with no other option",

The buffet had great vegetarian and meat selections. Every dish in the buffet tasted different than the last one and had so much flavor. I am Indian, so I know my Indian food. This place really reminded me of home cooked food. The owner and the servers were really attentive and made sure we always had naan and water on our table. They cleared out plates as soon as we were done. Because it was new years, the owner came and gave me and my friend a rose stem each and wished us a happy new year. It was a great gesture! (And no he wasn't hitting on us, we were there with our husbands!) He was genuinely a really nice person and they get an A++ in food as well as customer service!",

    "text": "Another lunch favorite!  I've been several times for lunch, and always eat at the buffet.  The food is delicious; there's various traditional options, including basmati rice, samosas, chicken dishes (e.g., chicken tikka), dal makhani, and other vegetarian dishes.  There's also fruit.  The buffet actually has a good variety of food.    My absolute favorite is the sweet rice, which is orange colored and has peanuts (or cashews?) in it.  I have a sweet tooth and love rice, so this is the best of both worlds for me.  I'm not a huge meat eater, but am not vegetarian either so I end up loading up on the sweet rice.      My runner-up favorite (or actually maybe tied) is the naan.  Whoa nelly, the naan is ALWAYS warm and soft.  We always get a basket that has plain naan and naan with garlic.  The garlic naan is super good.  Although I'm sure it's a huge faux pas, I love getting the orange marmalade from the buffet (for the fruit) and putting just a little on the naan.  That's my dirty little secret at Mt. Everest.  Overall, it's a great place to have lunch.  It's generally busy or at least half way full.  I think it also feels a little nicer because the tables in the center of the restaurant have linen table cloths.  Oh! And another plus -- they usually have a Bollywood movie playing on a flat screen tv above the buffet.  The sound is not on or is low, but it's fun to watch nevertheless!",

The restaurant wasn't that busy at that time. We were seated immediately. We ordered Samosa Chat for appetizer. The chat was ok, it was covered into much yogurt and there was no tamarind sauce on it. The dinner order was Vegetable Navarattan Korma, Daal Makhani, and Chicken Tikka Masala with Garlic Naan. The curries come with rice, which is a plus.  The curries were delicious and there was plenty leftover food for next day. The naan was fresh and tender.

It met our expectations. We arrived at 1:15 with concerns whether the food would still be fresh and it was. We tasted just about everything and enjoyed it all. Nothing was too spicy. Naan is brought to the table. The tandoori chicken was moist and seasoned just right. I especially enjoyed the cauliflower and potatoes, the lentils, and the spinach paneer. I did not try the goat curry but the hubby did and he liked it, which is surprising because he never orders curry. We will come back.",

We did the lunch buffet today for about $11 bucks each person which I thought was reasonably priced considering all the delicious food you get. I don't remember the names of all the dishes I ate (there were too many to remember), but everything was so good and wasn't disappointed! They bring a basket of buttery naan to your table which was delicious as well. And there was this sweet bread dessert that killed the sweets craving. I definitely recommend trying out this place! And if it's your first time like me try a little bit of everything, you won't regret it. I'll definitely be coming back here again.",

It is an All You Can Eat Indian buffet with all sorts of Indian dishes for just $10.99.  Believe me when this very reasonable price of $10.99 is worth way more than the price you pay. Each time I've been here for lunch it's been packed with people spilling out while waiting for tables to free up.  There's even not a lot of parking.  Most of the time these are good signs of how delicious a place is and this was the case here. Is it authentic Indian? I wouldn't know but a few of my vo-workers from India like them too, though I haven't seen others from India dine here at the same time as me.  I never asked what a dish was or what's inside so all I can say is that I enjoyed them all, the green stuff, the orange stuff, the yellow and brown stuff, the stuffed bread stuff, and the fried battered stuff, all very delicious. They were labeled but I don't remember what each was because I usually sample them all. There was a red chicken, not to be mistaken for char sui, and another meat dish. Ask for the Garlic Naan, the freshest right out of the oven?? the better.  They do have non-buffet options.  It use to be a Burger King so imagine that kind of space on the inside and they have a TV playing films from India. Customer service is usually fast and friendly so the only reason that I think there's a long wait is because they are very good and those there first are enjoying the goods.",

I like that the owner and his family work together and are very service oriented.  Of course the food is why we would go and, again, it exceeded our expectations.  Clearly, the best Indian food in Las Vegas.  The chicken tikka masala was excellent as was the lamb vindaloo.  Big menu making it hard to choose and I found myself looking at all the great dishes coming out if the kitchen.  Try and get there early to get a booth as it looks much more comfortable than a regular table.  Highly recommended and we will be back soon with our friends.",

I'm a vegetarian, and they have a superb list of veggie dishes. Some of my favorites are the paneer tikka masala, the malai kofta, the dal makhani and the palak paneer. One of my absolute favorite dishes here is one of their appetizers-the veggie momo. It's a supple dumpling filled with mixed veggies and spices, perfectly steamed, and served with a spicy dip. I dream about it. The owner is so down to earth and nice. He always recognizes me and my family and is so kind to us. I don't usually post reviews of places that I eat, but I'll definitely go out of my way to recommend this delicious restaurant. Give it a try!",

Everest , it's all downhill. ha ha get it? that's right my friend, you will never have it as good.   So far I have only been here for the lunch buffet. Here at least once a week. sometimes twice.  My only previous experience eating Indian was when I lived in nyc for 20 years. There is probably 2 million indian restaurants there....one for every cab driver. Let me tell you my friend, even the best one there could not compete with mt. everest. I remember the last place i used to eat at, called CHOLA. Supposedly it was great. Always packed with indians. Their food was always greasy and made me feel tired afterwards (probably from chemical, or cheap quality?)  Mt. everest is NOT like any other indian restaurant you have eaten in. The food is NOT greasy!!! The quality of the ingredients is fresh, and of high quality. I don't know how they do it...EVERY dish at that buffet is a solid TEN.   I wish they would raise their buffet price to keep all the riff-raff like you yelpers out. Sadly, this place gets jam packed at lunch.   The best part is that a corona is only $3.50. I really appreciate it when restaurants don't try to RAPE customers on liquor prices. Actually the food is the best part.  wait the best part is the great indian music videos on tv there...wow, those guys know how to deliver a show",

The inside is very nice, linen on the tables and clean. We are early eaters so we were the start of their dinner crowd, it filled up quickly as we ate.   We ordered the garlic Naan and it was awesome, made to order. My husband had the Lamb Korma on my recommendation and I had the Chicken Korma. They also have a veggie Korma that is probably just as good. Portion sizes are large.  Don't judge a book by its cover or you will miss out on some really outstanding Indian Cuisine.

I will give it another shot if I am in the area, but I don't see myself driving out of the way to eat here. Their buffet is fairly limited and most of the food lacked ANY spice factor. It was almost bland and some of it was overcooked. My favorite part was the rice and the naan. I did finish my small plate and had no desire for seconds. The meats were fatty and low quality and the buffet was not exactly cheap at $10.99 + tip. The owner seems like a nice gentleman and recognized my friend who worships this place. The service however was close to non existent and toward the end we felt rushed. I am a fan of Indian food and have sampled several places around town, and this would probably stack somewhere in the middle. I would be interested in trying their dinner items to see how they stack up in that category. Overall, just an okay Indian buffet with not much separating it from the rest of the pack other than the owner who seems to care about his return patrons.",

SO happy we did, the food was delicious (Chicken Tikka Masala, naan, etc.) with a good amount of chicken in the dishes and plenty of rice to have left-overs for the next day. AND we even came back later that week, because we couldn't get enough of the great food. Really nice owner too!",

I would highly recommend this restaurant to anyone looking for Indian food. The staff here are extremely friendly and know their food. The owner came over to our table to make sure everything was to our liking, and seemed genuinely thankful to us for visiting his restaurant - very rare in this town! Their food is incredible, and doesn't come out highly oiled like some Indian food does. Bottom line... Give this place a shot!",

I usually hate lamb, but I loved it here. The service was a little slow only because they were busy, but our party really didn't mind. The owner is very friendly and also let us try their rice pudding dessert which I found surprisingly different in a great way. Definitely will be coming back. Yum!!!",

Bollywood movies play in the background as I wait, and then dine on my Chicken Mahkani  my 'go-to' meal when I come here. The Garlic Naan is bar none, and I could really just eat that as a mea,l in of itself. The Basmati rice is always cooked to perfection and a nice accompaniment to the entrees. Las Vegas' Best Kept lil secret! Who needs fancy deco when you can have fancy Indian food at an extremely reasonable price. Vegetarian options are always available.  A GREAT first date place..snd a GREAT Happily Ever After regular. LOVE this place!",

Their naan bread was deeeelicious! The garlic naan was our favorite. They were very generous with the amount of garlic used on top, unlike other Indian restaurants I've been to. The chicken tikka masala was PERFECTLY spiced!  ..Even though we had to dig for pieces of chicken. I'd definitely go back just for the garlic naan and chicken tikka masala! Being our first meal of the day, we were too full for a second round. We each had a mango lassi which might've been why we got full so fast.   It's a super casual place, not formal at all. The service was good as well. If you're looking to satisfy your Indian food cravings, this place will do its job!",

    "text": "I am surprised Mt Everest has a higher rating than MINT because it is not even close to the same quality.  When I pulled up I was surprised to see a drive thru but then I realized it was closed and the employees were using it to park their cars. Upon walking into the restaurant, I noticed the buffet in the back corner looking sad and unsanitary. I sat down and shortly after we were brought out the papadum and were asked what we wanted to order. The papadum and sauces just weren't good and to top things off the basket it was in was not cleaned. I shouldn't have overlooked this but I did because I was craving Indian food. I ordered two mango lassi's, garlic naan, malai kofta, chicken makhani their speciality, and basmati rice. The mango lassi's were brought out instantly. This one was not made well, was overly sweet, tasted artificial, and was not thick enough. I was able to stomach mine but my dining partner wanted to send hers back. I asked the Asian man if we could send it back and he giggled and said no. Then our Indian waiter comes over laughs and says Mango Lassi's our supposed to be sweet and I said I know I have had my a Mango Lassi before but but this overly sweet, he begrudgingly took it back.   Our entrees come and the portions are huge. Both of the curries had that artificial taste and reminded me of curry at a food court. The chicken in the chicken makhani was dry and the fat was not trimmed off properly. The veggie balls in the malai kofta were extremely hard on the outside and not very moist on the inside. The garlic naan was tasty but once again it was brought out in a basket that was not clean.   The Indian food here is mediocre and I question how well things are cleaned.",

When I asked them about not having rice kheer dessert, they said it rotates with other different items (that day had a mango dessert). Darn. To my surprise, he brings out a complimentary bowl of kheer. Awesome! It is one of my favorite desserts; so simple, yet so good. The naan is nice and fluffy, too.",

I'm a veggie so I love the Paneer dishes and Veggie Korma but I would be happy eating anything on the menu!   My boyfriend gets the Tandoori chicken and Paneer dishes as well but tonight he tried the chicken and noodles. He died over how amazing it was!

The staff is nice and the chicken isnt dry and jerky on the edges , like sometimes when you get cheap chinese orange chicken . Its just delicioussss here !  I know its basic but try their butter chicken. only thing i would change is to have an itemized copy of the receipt given to all customers including togo order customers that way we can see the itemized charges.",

The Chicken Tikka masala is a must, as well as the vegetable koorma. They've also got some great desserts - rice pudding and gulab jamun!   The food, service and attention is great and I can't wait to come back.  Looking forward to trying their mango lassis.",

They have this mashed carrot dessert (gajar halwa) that is served hot and it's got a unique taste and texture. I haven't been able to find this at other Indian buffets and I really like it. They rotate between that and the sweet ball thing (gulab jamun) and it always makes my day when I see they have the carrot dessert out. But after several missed encounters with the carrot dessert I actually have a calendar now to keep track of the days they would have it. They have very good palak paneer as well and the owner is really nice.  Update: My sister's Indian friend really likes this place and says the carrot dessert tastes exactly like how her mom makes it. Authenticity confirmed.",

    "text": "We were a party of 8 folks who flew from Buffalo to LV and were super hungry. We got out of the airport and folks decided to go to an Indian restaurant for dinner.   After seeking some yelphelp and thanks to fellow yelper's review - we decided to go to Mt. Everest. The place is not ambient or upscale..It is very casual and less attractive...but the best part was the food and then the service. We got in that night close to getting the kitchen closed...and there was a huge party that was leaving. So it took some time for the restaurant folks to have us seated. Once we were shown our table, the owner Prakash made sure we are comfortable and took our orders. We had a good mix of Veg and Non Veg order. We ordered that night Chicken Pepper Fry, Chicken Biryani, Goat Biryani, Shrimp Biryani, Naan, Aloo Gobi, Veg Biryani and one more veg gravy....(don't remember it now)...The food was a mix of Indian and Nepali style. The service very prompt and we got our first order Chicken Pepper Fry and it was not that good - we felt like it was taken from the leftovers of that afternoon buffett..however the biryani - all of them were presumptuous quantity and excellent taste..so it out beat the chicken pepper fry. The aloo gobi was excellent and it was perfectly made.   So our first night in LV experience was very satisfying. We decided to go there again before we head out to the Airport for our return flight. This time, more or less we ordered the same menu item. We did give Mr. Prakash the feedback on the chicken pepper fry. He acknowledged and let us know that he is going to the let the chef know to make it a better and he did. The food was amazing but the real 5 star is for the service that the restaurant provided.   This is a definite go for me the next time am in LV. Way to go Mt. Everest.",

I goes very well with the garlic naan.  Tandoori Chicken. I know it sounds stupid but I love the pickled onions that come with the chicken. Oh and the chicken is good too! Garlic Naan. Always fresh!

It's in a sketchier place in Las Vegas, but luckily there are large enough windows in the restaurant to keep an eye out on our car. The service was great to start. We ordered a chicken tikka masala and chicken vindaloo, with some naan, and a mango lassi. Every order was authentic, fresh tasting, great portion, and awesome quality.

Some of the Lunch Buffet items are Palak Paneer, Vegetable Samosa, Yellow Dal, Aloo Baingan, Raita, Chili Chicken, Goat Curry, Tandoori Chicken, Malai Kofta Yellow Dal, Chicken Tikka Masala. Gajar Halwa and Kheer for deserts.  Lunch buffet is $11.99  The Tandoori Chicken and Goat curry were solid and well spiced and the Chicken Tikka Masala was very good, with a nice little kick, and all your other standard-fair Indian buffet options were tasty. The rice, which of course is an important element of any indian meal was fluffy, warm and flavorful.   They also do buffet takeout, you get a box, naan and a cup for your soup.",

    "text": "This place was \"BOMB\"bay.  First time here.  Just walking into the place I knew it was going to be awesome.  You can smell the aroma of the spices... so good.  You'll see/smell what I mean when you walk in.  We went for dinner.  Because I had \"just a taste\" of Chicken Korma from another restaurant, I had to try it at the next Indian restaurant I went to. We also ordered the Goat Curry, the Chicken Biriyani (Rice), and Garlic Naan.  We ordered the Korma and Curry in mild.    Once we got our food I went straight for the Naan to dip into the Chicken Korma sauce to get a feel for the spice level.  Some places you order mild and they give you extra spicy.  So for me my first thought was \"oh, this isn't bad, it isn't spicy at all, maybe we should have gotten a level up.\"  Then I took a bite of the chicken by itself and it was nice and tender... and then it came, the flavor of the spice kicked in and magic happened.  The spice level was perfect to my liking.  I took the sauce of the Chicken Korma and spread it on the Garlic Naan as if it were jelly on a piece of toast and that there was magic in my mouth.  After you bit into that, there's a hint of sweetness and it's amazing.    As for the Goat Curry, I love the meat itself.  I wish we had a lot of meat that came with it.  Because the Chicken Korma sauce was awesome, I wished the Goat came in that sauce instead.  But the Goat Curry was still good. The Chicken Biriyani too was full of flavor and awesome. But to my liking, I would have taken out the raisins and the nuts.  That's just me tho. I'm not a fan of fruits in my entree.  And the Garlic Naan was delish!  So good that we ordered more to go!  This place just became my favorite Indian restaurant hands down.    So with that being said, Happy Eatings!  Until next time @~}~~~",

The Mango Lassi was a standard lassi flavored from a can, and nothing special. The potato pancakes (Aloo Tikki) were excellent, but could have had more spice/flavor. I enjoyed the eggplant-potato (Aloo Baigan), but asked for medium spice and got no spice at all. Meanwhile, the chicken tikka was asked for with no spice and got medium spice. The chicken was very tender and flavorful.   The service is a little bit slow, and there were a couple of times that the wait was long enough for service to get our order taken/between sources that we had to flag a waiter down (the restaurant wasn't busy).   I would have liked to see a place that had a more comfortable/upscale feel - it was pretty divey.   All in all, the food was okay, and I could be tempted to go again for some cheap-o Indian food. It could be better though, and with a variety of choices to choose from, I'm much more likely to go somewhere else.",

    "text": "What happens in Vegas stays in Vegas!! Not this time!!! I have got to share my epic experience at Mt Everest Indian restaurant with all of you who are going to be visiting Vegas in the future. Bookmark it, put it on your must do and have to visit list.  My Everest at 29,028 feet is the highest mountain on earth and one of the most beautiful sights and wonders of the world. Lucky to have flown over it in 1998 and taken some priceless videos and photos.    Wednesday September 20, 2017 Las Vegas, Nevada got a similar rush and thrill as I had an amazing lunch at Mt Everest Indian restaurant on W Sahara Ave:  1) Tasty, wholesome, lovely food prepared and served with a lot of love. The brown lentils and kidney beans were to die for. The potatoes and cauliflower dish was done just right and the flavors were so distinct and unique. The garlic naan bread was probably the best I have ever had. It was hot, fresh and had that lovely garlic that just stimulates your taste buds. Big smile!! The raita or yogurt with diced cucumbers, tomatoes, onions and spices was the best I have ever had. It was cool and not creamy and lumpy. Bigger smile.  2) Beautiful staff who were so caring, proactive and warm. Lunch hour was packed and they sure kept the flow going with grace and class. Loved meeting the very sweet Nepalese chef in his awesome Nepalese hat( or Bhadgaunle cap) who came out to check on the items and wished me with a great smile.  3) $10.90 for an AYCE featuring 6 non vegetarian items, 5 excellent and ample vegetarian options, a great and fresh salad and pickle bar plus multiple v good desserts and fruit is beyond sweet.  4) Perfect getaway from the strip. It is almost 2 miles west of the casinos and  I-15 on Sahara Ave and Valley View with no crazy traffic and loads of parking.  5) Clean place! The staff is on top of the buffet.   6) Clean, air conditioned and stocked rest room.  This was perfect. My review is the 1092nd review of this wonderful restaurant. I concur, I loved Mt Everest!!",

When I think of buffet, I think of mediocre food lined up under the heat lamp. The food here is all good quality.  I really like the fact that they offer honey rice here. I can't handle spice too well and honey rice has a hint of sweetness that balances well with the spices from curry. I would highly recommend getting their spinach paneer (cheesy spinach curry) and lamb curry (lamb is super tender).   As for dessert I like getting their rice pudding and fresh fruits.   I've brought my friends here who lived in India for many years and she assures that the food here is close to the traditional Indian food she used to eat back in India.

As soon as we stepped in, we felt like getting out. Since we drove some distance to get here, we decided to give it a shot anyway! Being in Vegas, almost every restaurant seems to have a good number of reviews and that fact deceived us. The people who dined here and gave these good reviews seem to not have tried authentic Indian food and thereby this restaurant ended up having a 4.5 rating with 1200+ reviews which paints a completely wrong picture altogether.  When we arrived, there was a little wait time. The lunch buffet had some really mediocre dishes. Even the choice of dishes seemed pretty boring and everyday like. When you go to an Indian buffet, you expect some lavish dishes, but here you won't! Tandoori Chicken and Fish Fry were overloaded with red food color and were both bone-dry and no flavor. Awful! How can they mess up a Samosa? I can go on talking about how bad every individual dish was but it is only going to sound redundant because everything was so below par. To top everything, they ruined the Gulab Jamuns too! My goodness! Never again :-I  Rating the following out of 5:  AMBIANCE - 1 I want to rate this in negative!  FOOD- 1 Lunch Buffet - 1  CUSTOMER SERVICE - 2 The servers are inattentive. My husband asked for some cut onions and we kept waiting for so long.  WAIT TIME - 3 A little wait time. Not too bad.  HYGIENE - 3  PARKING - 4 This restaurant is located in probably the dullest part of Las Vegas!! It is in a complex so you shouldn't have a problem finding a place to park.  I usually take pictures of the food(always) and restaurant(sometimes) but this place just turned me off!",

Instead of bringing check to the table he treated us in a different way. Maybe he thought we are not from here. But we are customers and all customers should be treated in the same respectful manner.

I recently moved back home and took my family here. Their lunch buffet was exactly how I remembered it; excellent. While their selection of food during their buffet isn't the largest, the quality of the food is amazing. From goat curry to tandoori to other North Indian dishes; this place always delivers. The only knock on this place during my latest visit was our waiter. I don't know if he was having a bad day but he wasn't very friendly which isn't normal here. But if you want good Indian food at a very reasonable price then come to their lunch buffet and support a great local business. I've been going here throughout the last 20 years and will continue to come.",

    "text": "I think I've found my new favorite Indian restaurant in Las Vegas!   They have a good sized menu that has very good descriptions to help you if you aren't super familiar with Indian food.     We ended up getting the non-veg Thali which is about 22 bucks.  It seemed like not enough food at first and we were worried we'd have to order more but we left fully satisfied with stuffed bellies.    I really liked how they allowed us to substitute items (I love jalfrezi) and choose what dessert we wanted.   I also really appreciated that the server had a good amount of patience for us and made sure we were getting exactly what we wanted.   We can't wait to come back and get a full order of lamb jalfrezi.  So good!",

We came in for the lunch buffet. It is a decent price (10.99) with a good selection of menu items.   I had the chicken tikka masala (thumbs up), basmati rice (had some hard pieces, that was the downer...otherwise the flavor was on point), vegetable korma (sooo good!), palak paneer (absolutely amazing!!!), tandoori chicken thighs (flavor a bit bland, and texture a bit dry), plain naan was brought to the table...I normally do garlic naan, but this naan was so fresh and delicious without the extra spices, mango lassi (just near perfect...missing cardamom...I added some at home and it was perfection!), gulab jamun (it was good, I was so full by then, I only ate 1...and this was my first time trying it, by the way),  vegetable samosa (tasty and spicy), vegetable pakora (very flavorful, good texture to have been sitting on a buffet line).   So in conclusion, I was very happy with my meal and have been thinking of their food ever since lol!    The service:  Good service and friendly staff!  Needless to say, I will be returning!",

They serve the typical curries you would see at Indian buffets:  chicken curry, chicken tikka masla, tandoori chicken, vegetable koorma, samosas, vegetable curry etc.  They have a great vegetarian selection.  My favorites are the paleek paneer (the spinach one) and chicken tikka Masala.  The servers are also pretty quick with the Naan.    Mount Everest also serves dessert which is included in the rice buffet.  An option of oranges or rice pudding.  Their mango lassis are also delicious.  Its pretty thick and has a heavy taste of yogurt.",

We got here around 2pm and there was a short line.  The place was completely packed and the aroma was so good.  Packed with People of Indian / Hindu descent - great sign! The buffet spread had plenty of vegetarian choices and plenty of meat dishes along with a few dessert dishes and a small salad bar.  Every dish I tried was just heaven.  Not too hot but the nose was a little runny and my forehead sweaty (spicy but not too spicy).  Just delightful.  The kids loved their samosas and chicken tikka masala. The service was very attentive and courteous.  Prices extremely reasonable.  We would definitely come again.",

But that site isn't what it used to be, and since Mt. Everest is quite a distance from where we live, we hadn't been back in over a year.  But I missed the place, and felt bad that the owner had always been so nice and accommodating to us, and didn't think we were being upstanding citizens by not rewarding his hospitality.  Not only did he remember us, he even remembered the fact that I hate overly salty food!!  I ordered a glass of the house Woodbridge Riesling, and for $5 got something rare: a FULL glass.  We thought we'd order a mulligatawny soup to share, in addition to the Mt. Everest thali that we were also going to share, but the owner talked us out of it, saying I'd find it too salty.  Now that's service!  He suggested the Chau Chau soup instead, which has noodles, onion, cilantro, and tomato.  It had just the right amount of kick and was very tasty.  And not salty.    Having the thali was definitely like coming home again.  A large appetizer platter of  goodies, including a delicious samosa, tandoori chicken, beef kebab, and lots of pakora filled me up before the piece de resistance, the large silver tray with my favorite - palak paneer - which had a goodly amount of the paneer, lentils, chicken tikka, lamb curry, raita, and the dessert, kheer.  We had asked for kulfi instead of the kheer, and for it to be served at the end of the meal, since it's frozen.  No problem - we got the kulfi, and were told to keep the kheer anyway.  Everything was excellent, except for the lamb, which was tough.  I could have said something, but who needed more food?  We took some leftovers home anyway.  We're not going wait another year before going back to Mt. Everest.  It's that good!",

Friendly and quick delivery guy.    One thing really stood out... the portions are H U G E !  I was thinking, hey, we're kind of spending a lot on food, but then when I saw how much they give you, it's a total bargain!  One order of rice came in a very large container.  If you put one of the sauces on top, you could easily make 3 portions!  4 even! Maybe even 5, depending on how hungry people are.   They are probably the most generously-sized portions I've ever seen from an Indian restaurant.  Perhaps because I ordered during a buffet hour?  Not sure, but wow.    I would like to actually visit this place in the future.   Thank you!",

We were seated in a dark corner where I literally needed to put my food under lamp in aisle to see it. There's a bunch of mismatched furniture everywhere.   Ordered the Mt Everest thali platter. It was mostly delicious, a little under-seasoned. One of the first things that is brought out is some kind of sausage (?), some battered veg and a pakora. That part of the meal was underwhelming. The sausage was very dry and the battered veg was just ok. Neither was too tasty.   There was a variety of 4-5 V and NV curries that were served along with rice and plain naan. The naan was incredible and had a bit of a crust which I've never seen before. I'd come back again maybe if I was in the area and order thali as it was very filling and provided a variety of foods to try. Lassis are tasty!",

The tikka was ok, big chunks of tender chicken, but the sauce was too sweet. The palak paneer was very good, although I like it a little spicier. The lamb vindaloo was excellent. Big, juicy chunks of lamb perfectly spiced. I'm usually not a big fan of lamb, but i really liked it. The chicken korma was excellent as well. Again, big chunks, perfectly spiced, delicious. Garlic nann was perfect. Two pieces were plenty for the four of us (with all the rest we ordered.)   The service was exceptional. Very prompt, polite, and helpful. No one at our table had ever tried goat, and my brother-in-law was asking our server about it. The server was a very nice young man and tried to describe the flavor, texture, etc. Anyway, we ended up with the lamb vindaloo instead. Later, the server came by with a sample of the goat curry. He didn't have to do that, it was very nice. And, I found out I love goat! Absolutely delicious. He also brought fresh rice to take home with our leftovers. I felt he went above and beyond. We'll eat here again next time we're in Vegas!",

The Korma and Tikki Masala were full of great flavor and  the meat was perfectly tender. Dipping the garlic Naan into the sauces was just delicious. The service here was outstanding as well. Very attentive staff and they have a great sense of humor as well. Definitely coming back and I hope you foodie fanatics that haven't tried Indian yet will give this place a shot.",

We love Indian buffets, but in the Midwest the quality level can vary quite a bit.  Mount Everest hits it out of the park.  Price was incredibly reasonable (10-15$), they had just about every Indian food I've ever had available, and the taste was sublime.  Mouth-watering delicious.  The staff was polite and friendly too.  The bus ride was very reasonable.  We bought a Deuce Bus 24 hr pass ($8) which was also good for the city bus, so we were able to hop one from the strip over to there.  Its a pretty quick ride and the neighborhood seemed fine.  I've snagged the Duece pass each time I've been in Vegas and despite being slow at times its one of the best ways to save money when out on the town.  If you are an Indian Buffet lover, this is my favorite of all the ones I've had, so definitely make the time and give it a stop.",

The Goat stew the meat was a bit tough but the flavor was good, disappointing though cause goat meat is usually very tender and is hard to mess up.  The biggest fault was the chicken curry.  The chicken curry had very little flavor that stood out and considering all the other fantastic flavors of the other dishes was a bit bland. I still give them 4 stars.  Cause everything else was really really good.  The restaurant was very clean.  So now that I reviewed the food I will say that the service was just mediocre.  They don't check on their guests to see if they need anything and are usually talking among themselves in the front corner of the restaurant by their register.  I would return however to this place again.",

The prices were pretty average, and the location is not the best - but I do love a good hole in the wall from time to time.    Will I go here again?  Yep, I'd love to.

We grow up eating the stuff, there are more Indian restaurants in England than Mickey D's. Really! Would I embellish? Maybe but I don't think so in this instance.  Anyway, Friday night and the kids ditched us. Outrageous I know, but gives Wifee and I a rare chance to eat what we want. \"Yuhi K. recommends a place down on Sahara\" I explain. \"Who is Yuhi K.?\" asks my leader. \" She knows about food\" I explain unconvincingly.  It is a long drive down W.Sahara from my hood and Wifee is viewing my choice with suspicion. \" It will be great\" I proclaim \"be patient\".   Mt.Everest sits in front of a slightly rundown strip mall but parking is easy and my expedition was a success.  We were greeted promptly and offered a table or booth. Booth. The greeter/server guy seemed to be the owner. He was great. Recommended a great beer, Taj Mahal, 1.5 pints of frothy cold delight, Wifee grabbed a nice cold Chardonnay.  We started with a mixed dish of samosa, kebab, chicken tikka and some other stuff. Fantastic and more than enough to share.  Mains: I had a Mushroom lamb dish, I am asked how spicy I would like. being a big shot expert Indian food eater , I asked for 7/10. Too hot! I'm such a wimp after many years away from Blighty, Really quite pathetic. I tell my server/owner/guy. No problem! He took it away and brought it back re done at a more acceptable spiceness. ( I'm pretty sure that's not a word, sorry). Delicious! Served with rice and a garlic naan.   Wifee has Chicken Saag, she ordered 6/10 on the heat scale. Perfect!  Water was always topped up, drinks were offered frequently. Really great and we are going back. Often.   Thanks Yuhi K.!!!!!",

As far as Vegas is concerned, this place is the best!! The 5 stars is for a combination of great quality food at a very decent price brought to you with amazing service. I always feel welcome here and have been recognized and acknowledged by only coming once. After they meet you the first time, they remember you and treat you like a friend. I am so grateful I was referred here by my boss who is from Pakistan and recognizes good Indian food.",

Atmosphere: Great Mom & Pop shop, clean, nice culture and music. Service: Excellent: They probably fill up my water glass 8 times during the meal whenever its half empty! Now to the good stuff, the food:  The food is consistent every time I go in and is large portions. The prices are reasonable. The food is always extremely hot and can be adjusted by spice level. The raita is a good way to go with the garlic naan. Also the crackers with indian chutneys at the beginning of the meal are complimentary and great.  Chicken tikka masala is unreal! Check this place out, you won't be disappointedf! Thanks, Prakash and Mt. Everest :)",

She said this is hands down her favorite Indian restaurant in the city. So after a couple months of persuading, my two friends who aren't so adventurous in cuisines as much as I am, finally decided to accompany me to Mt. Everest. I'd admit the venue is a bit sketchy but I just kept pulling the two inside. I already know my favorite Indian dishes, so I ordered for my friends since they don't know what dishes are what. We went for Chicken Tikka Masala, Korma, and tandoori. I thought those dishes were the most \"friendly\" to those who've never had Indian food before, so yeah. We also got garlic and regular naan combination, and mango lassi (my favorite!). I liked every dish we ordered, especially the Korma. I can't stop dipping my garlic naan into it. And the lassi was just perfect. I wanted to drink a whole pitcher if I could. The service was very friendly and he didn't hesitate to help us with any questions regarding the dishes. In past experiences with Indian restaurants, I felt like the service have been quite rushed and somewhat rude, but Mt. Everest's server was quite congenial. I think the prices aren't bad and the serving was enough for people to share. I think I've found my go to Indian restaurant. I'll definitely try their lunch buffet.",

The food was amazing and a perfect journey through the different tastes and textures of Indian food. It was a perfect way for someone new to the cuisine to experience many different tastes and in wonderful and large portions. The service was top notch by a gentleman I assume was the owner. I regret not getting his name but plan on returning there many times so I will make sure to get his name another trip. The inside of the restaurant was nicely decorated and clean, quiet and fairly empty for a Wed night, but has a very welcoming feeling and we both enjoyed it very much...thank you everyone at Mt Everest India's Cuisine!!

Prices are always very reasonable for the portions provided, and the staff is happy to tailor the level of spice to any palate without losing the key flavors. The atmosphere of the restaurant is always warm and welcoming with soft lighting and a real ceiling with better acoustics for a good talk over a meal (rather than the new fad at restaurants of a large cavernous warehouse ceiling and raucous noise requiring you to shout at your dinner companion.) My personal favorites are the momo, the butter chicken, the paratha, and the mango lassi, but every dish we have tried is of the highest quality and flavor. I highly recommend Mt. Everest to all my closest friends and visitors to Vegas who want to get away from the Strip for something different that tastes wonderful!",

The booth had white linen table cloth and white cloth napkins with better than the usual flatware and water goblet.  Unfortunately, lunch is ONLY the buffet for $10.99 [it is not clear if this is ALL-YOU-CAN-EAT].  A menu is only for dinner. The buffet had a \"sneeze\" shield with sticky notes with handwritten names for whatever was under the shield.  The labels were for the Indian name of the dish; not very helpful if you're not an Indian speaker. The \"wet\" items were soupy and the \"dry\" items were dry to an extreme.  The two best items, IMHO, were the chicken curry and the white rice, while the others were forgettable.  The condiments I normally associate with curry [like coconut, peanuts, grated onion, etc. were absent; although the chutney was present, but unremarkable as chutney]. I would hazard a guess that those giving five stars are native speakers and are familiar with the food in the buffet.  Since I'm neither, this made things awkward.",

Service : This is where I cut one star. We had to wait 15 minute before owner/server took our order. We enjoyed free papad in mean time.  Food : We ordered Paneer Tikka & Malai Kofta. Curry came with rice. I loved the taste, my wife didn't (it was bit spicy for her). Food quantity was big.  Price : Reasonable considering quantity, free papad & rice.  It was good experience overall.",

The food is absolutely phenomenal and the prices are so reasonable unlike most of the other Indian restaurants I've come across. You can tell everything is made fresh and from scratch which I love. Everything I have gotten from here has always been delicious and I've never been disappointed. My personal favorites are the mushroom mutter and  the aloo baignan (I apologize for any misspelling).  The sweet rice is also to die for. I'm assuming it was the owner who asked us how everything was and asked if we wanted dessert. We declined and he didn't take no for an answer (which I'm so happy he didn't!). They brought us some rice pudding with what was essentially a donut ball in the center and it was mind blowingly delicious. I recommend this place to anyone and everyone. You'll never be disappointed here.",

I called for some quick Mali Kofta and naan with jasmin rice considering I'm going vegetarian for two weeks .i needed major flavor. This place is near work so I thought I'd give it a go.   Well they didn't disappoint! I ordered through the YELP APP for pick up and it was simple. I got there before my order was ready but they offered me water and allowed me to take up booth space to wait. The atmosphere was in assuming typical hole in the wall Indian food.   Considering it was 9:30 pm and they close at 10pm I figured I'd get the last scraps of the day, but I didn't care. However, I received the order promptly, got back to work to open my to go box to the luscious aroma of curry, garlic and veggies! Oh my! The dog even started to drool! It was phenomenal!! No doubt exceeded my expectations! I inhaled it and the naan too! Naan was warm and garlicky! It was crunchy yet soft in the middle! Perfect! Only complaint was my mango lassi was way too sweet! Other than that, spot on! Good job on great food late at night! Now if we can get them to deliver!!",

He claimed he touched me so that I didn't back into him but it was much more than that.  He claimed it was innocent but I doubt that. When I complained he did not act apologetic or professional but merely claimed he did no wrong even though he admitted the touch.  NEVERGO TO THIS PLACE!!!  The staff does not act professional and to make matters worse the food is not that good.  There are plenty of other Indian food places in Las Vegas with better food and where you will not get assaulted (definition is unwelcome touching) while dining there.",

I tried the Lamb Vindoolo ($12.99) which is cooked with potatoes and Chilly sauce. The lamb was tender and surprisingly no weird after taste. It was really good ! I also had a Mango Lassi that was super delicious. I'm glad it came in a clean glass because at Bollywood they gave me a glass with a whole bunch of fingerprints all over it. That was a turn off!   My husband had a salad with garlic naan .The salad tasted great with the naan but too sour without it. The naan came out hot and had a nice garlicky taste to it.

Now, probably three years later and 20 lbs heavier, the owner won't let me forget it Haha. To b honest it's kind of funny seeing as I'm also 7 months pregnant. But every time I go in he's gotta say something about my weight. I don't think he knows I'm pregnant because I'm just so shocked he'd treat anyone like that, much less a customer. But then again... Weird creepy foreigner vibe... Am I right ladies ?

The spices just didn't come through for me. The tandoori chicken and chicken in the tikka masala were also dry.   As a buffet, the choices and most of the flavors were pretty solid. I guess I was just looking for more. On the other hand, the service was attentive and polite. If I crave Indian food, I may stop by for dinner to give it another try.",

The waiter was very patient in answering all my questions as I was a little nervous about what to try as I am new to Indian food and wasn't sure what was spicy and what wasn't. The service here is always great even when packed and I am always impressed. I highly recommend this place.",

We ordered the chicken momo, chicken tikka, and some goat curry. Everything was amazing!! Momos came with this sauce that tasted incredible. We definitely recommend leaving the strip for some authentic Indian food! :)",

I was with my parents and could not ramp up the spice so it was pretty cool but I didn't order it spicy. So I am curious to hit this place and tell them max spice and see how it is.  Each dish was good I thought it was kind of odd that I only got one rice with what appears to me to be 3 entrees. I requested a second rice and got charged. I dunno, thought it could be included. I also ordered these deep fried chiles to start. They were good but really unpredictable. One chiles was melt your face off the next had nothing so it was an interesting experience not sure what would happen next!  I would go again for sure. Everything was done well and the food was good. Hopefully with some spice it will be great! Oh yeah.. had a groupon there too which was nice",

    "text": "The BF and I came in and we were sat down immediately with some ice water and papadams with chutney as we browsed the menu.  We decided to get the  Mt Everest Special ($21.99) Which comes with: mixed appetizer, salad, papadam, chicken tikka, dal makhani, palak paneer, lamb curry, chicken tikka, rice, naan, raita. For dessert gulab jamun and chai tea.  We did not really get what was on the menu as we didn't get salad or our dessert but Kheer rice pudding instead. I didn't realize this until looking at the online menu for this review. Either way- it's alot of food but would have been nice to get what we ordered.   The mix appetizer was some grilled sausage, chicken tikka pieces, a samosa and little papadam bites. It was a very big plate and was super filling. The main dishes were decent with the paneer being my favorite. My one thing was that the paneer and the dal needed a bit of salt, but still good. Raita was more tangy and watery than most I've had, but was good to dip my naan in. The kheer was very nice and not too sweet.  Chicken Korma ($12.99)- entrees come with rice. It was decent, but was more yellow curry flavor than other kormas I've had.   We also got some garlic naan ($2.99) thinking that there might not be enough naan with the mixed plate but if we didn't order this the plain naan would be more than enough.   The amount of food for two people with that is crazy. We had leftovers which I had for two separate and still very sizable lunches. We would have been very full and satisfied with just the mixed plate, but we had a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate to use.   Service was okay. They started off good with drink refills when they came to drop off food. After a while they were doing tasks and seemed to be really into it towards of our meal so we sat there for a while needing things.   Overall, the food here isn't my favorite Indian but decent. It definitely is the most value large portions than any others I've been to.",

From the reviews I read I noticed that many customers suggest increasing the heat that comes with many of the entrees. I was afraid so I picked mild. I had tried the chicken vindaloo and I'm so glad I did. The spices were very well represented in this dish. It wasn't over whelming on your palate. And this dish comes with potatoes and a assortment of flavors. The sauce was tomato based and creamy. It came with rice, and if I could, I would eat it all day. There was no worrying about heartburn or indigestion having it mild. The waiter, the busboy and the manager are very professional. The manager, Prakash whom I shook hands with has such a kind heart and I look forward to coming back again. Before I forget, try the kilfi which is  ice cream with saffron and pistachia flavors that is very well represented. This is a must go to restaurant if you're in Vegas for a visit.",

The food is delicious - I almost always get the chicken tikka masala, but the chicken tandoori is to die for (spicy without being too much), and the naan (I've had garlic and regular) is fabulous.  Really, all the food I've had here has been excellent!  I also love their lunch buffet.  It's a good deal at $10.99, and there is always great variety.  I've been able to try many things that I would have never ordered (goat curry - yum!) but there are also always some of my favorites.  Their dinner menu is reasonably priced (especially with a Groupon) but the lunch buffet is definitely the deal to get if you're in the area at lunch time.  The first time I went the location was a little scary - it's on the corner next to a gas station and Mariana's supermarket and the outside is not super bright.  I was a little nervous, but as soon as I stepped inside I felt much better.  It is a cute place - tablecloths on the tables, well lit (not bright but definitely not \"shady\"), and the people are SO nice.  I've always had excellent service - definitely the nicest servers I've had in a long time!  I definitely highly recommend Mt. Everest!",
