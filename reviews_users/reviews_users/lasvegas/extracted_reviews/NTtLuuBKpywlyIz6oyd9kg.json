Plus, if you buy the special rolls, it's buy two get one free, so you can really check out the interesting ones on the menu and take some chances. Definitely a great/budget friendly place for casual dining.",

The owner is a super nice guy.  Knows where to get the best quality pieces of meat.  We literally eat at Sawa and the next day we were on the strip and tried a top sushi place.  Didn't even compare.  Consider this your Las Vegas insider tip. Sawa Sushi is the best.",

The teriyaki sauce is by far the best that I've ever tasted in long long time, tempura in the bento were perfectly made, I would say, food made with heart.

If you're able to take advantage of the special deal, the place seems more worthwhile. I don't recall seeing if they offered an AYCE option at this place.

It is easy to miss this little restaurant as it is swallowed up by a huge strip mall boasting a Target, Kohls, Big Lots and many more large retailers and fast food franchises alike. It is tucked away next to Kosters finance on Blue Diamond between Arville and Decatur. They have a great lunch menu offering bento boxes, sushi specials and the usual protein or veggies with teriyaki sauce and the fixings of miso soup and salad. They do not offer AYCE but their speciality rolls are buy 2 get 1 free making it very reasonably priced without the pressure of stuffing your face to get your money's worth out of AYCE prices. The fish is fresh, and rolls  wonderfully crafted with the right amount of rice to fish ratio. They also have a special on their beverages; buy one large Sapporo and get a free bottle of sake to share. The rolls vary in price, but average at about $10/$11 per roll.. of course if taking advantage of their special that brings the average prices down by a bit. The staff is courteous and attentive and the restaurant appears clean with simple, modern decor.",

    "text": "The place is small but nicely decorated, great atmosphere and comfortable. Our server was a nice lady - we think she was Japanese. And that made me all excited because it's gotta be authentic! Most sushi restaurants here now are mostly own by Korean or Mexican sushi chef, although that's not necessarily bad at all but I'm just saying I'm expecting something authentic here at Sawa.   However, I'm extremely disappointed at their sushi. It was very tiny and seemed poorly made. I said that because in Las Vegas now there's AYCE sushi everywhere. If you're not doing AYCE, you should provide higher quality or quantity of ingredients, and better presentation. For what I'm paying for, I wasn't satisfied with my sushi at Sawa.   I ordered 3 different sushi, but they were made and delivered in 3 separate times. I have never been to a place that done that unless I sat at sushi bar, which felt little odd. So they were just tiny sushi, tiny fish on top, and no presentation what so ever. The fish was good though very fresh.  We also ordered hamachi kama. That was very very good. I would recommend order this instead of sushi for sure.  Hot tea is NOT complimentary - it's $2.25 per person. It was authentic good quality matcha.   So if I'm craving for sushi - If I'm really hungry I would go somewhere AYCE. If I'm just having a little crave for raw fish, I would go for Soho because they're always generous on their portion with great quality. I wouldn't come back for sushi at Sawa again.",

She makes you feel like the chef is working just for you!  So very attentive..never a glass empty...never a dirty plate to linger...wish I could take her home!  The sushi was absolutely out of this world! I could not ask for anything better! Fresh, well-managed, so flavorful! They have specials buy two rolls can't one for me! Appetizers are perfect! We really enjoyed The spicy garlic edamame  and then we ordered the Ichi Bon, spicy garlic albacore roll and the red rock volcano roll! All of them absolutely delicious!  Super Secret yelp tip!! Try fresh wasabi root! Really makes your food Pop! This place offers it and doesn't charge extra! At Nobu it's $12! Enjoy!",

The boat comes with assorted nigiri and a two rolls of your choice. The fish was pretty fresh. I was a bit disappointed to find out that they font have AYCE though. I feel like this place isn't special and worth ordering individual order and so I only wish they had ACYE. The Miso Soup was average and the Cucumber Salad was extremely sour. The Philadelphia roll is made with Smoked Salmon so be aware if you're not a fan of it. Their varieties of crunchy rolls were pretty good and the size of the rolls are pretty big. The sushi chef is highly energetic and quick to make our orders and I was impressed that he memorized the orders based on the waiter just telling him. The waiter was amazing too. She was a quick worker, extremely friendly and always attentative of her surroundings. She would engage in conversations with the guest but as soon as an order was ready, she brought it to the tables immediately. If we were unhappy was any dish, they were kind to redo our orders to satisfy us. Very good service and food, but don't know if it's worth it unless they had All You Can Eat.",

So we decided to create our own rolls--and they said they wouldn't mind doing it!   The staff was soooo nice and helpful with getting the order together.  The sushi chefs quickly accommodated our requests and got the sushi made and to go quickly as we had our baby with us ready for bed and getting a little fussy.   It as really good sushi and very fresh. :)  We were very satisfied and would definitely go back!",

One of the rolls we did not even like at all It was kind of off from what the menu described and they still billed us for it and did not offer to replace it with anything else. All in all it was an OK experience but I do not think I would be very anxious to return.",

The sushi was a hit and miss. The Chu Toro sushi (one piece) was fantastic! The Uni (two pieces) was good but small. The Aji was ok. The Hotate (two pieces) lacked texture (more like mush) and did not taste fresh. It was also missing a citrus seasoning. This was listed on their blackboard special but turned out to be a disappointment. Also, the sushi rice fell apart easily...  Overall, it's a 3.5 stars place due to their sushi quantity and quality. The service brings it up to 4 stars.  Plenty of parking available in the shopping center.",

All the sushi is fresh and perfectly prepared.  There are so many different rolls to pick from! All the ones we've tried are delicious.  Today we were in and out within 40mins. Service is amazing. We always have Brittany as a server and she's amazing! Today she was the only server on shift with 8 tables and she was still on top of her game. Her service is impressive.  So happy to have found our date night spot. Highly recommend coming here!",

The fact that as simple as their ebi tasted \"eh\" made me not want to return. I've been to okay sushi places but they always have atleast the cooked shrimp right! I ordered a couple rolls too and they were just okay. I don't know how else to describe it but mediocre.   Just like the other comments on here, I agree that the sushi wasn't tasty enough to be a la carte. Their sushi tastes more of an AYCE quality. Even then, I found really good AYCE places that should be a la carte! So overall, it was just an okay experience!",

I find the quality of the sushi extremely delicious for the price. Taste like most sushi joints around the city . My boyfriend, my cousin, and her friend all enjoy this place as well. They also have some great combination platters if you don't want just rolls. They do not have all you can eat sushi.   DRINKS-If you buy a large Sapporo you get a house sake for free. In my personal experience with ALL house sake's, they are never the best tasting sake's but it's free and it taste great for free. They also have delicious Arnold Palmer's which can either be raspberry flavored or regular depending on what they have that day.   SERVICE-Every time I have been in they have the same kind waitress with dark hair who always has a smile on her face and it's nice to everybody. The chefs are also very friendly if you choose to sit at the bar. Great service all around.   PARKING-Plenty of parking as this place sits in a shopping parking lot  ATMOSPHERE-Small, cute and clean. Nice music playing while you eat.  DEALS-Listed above under food and drink",

Hubby said sashimi was good but nothing to rave about. Service was okay too.

    "text": "Went here the other day for lunch and Sawa Sushi did not disappoint!  They are much like other Sushi restaurants offering similar foods, however, the quality of the servings, quantity and presentation were totally top notch!  The room setting is somewhat small, but comfortable enough and cozy enough to have small talk conversation.  One thing I noticed is immediately when you walk in, you're greeted with a banner in your face.  Not a bad thing, just kind of different I guess.  I'm not sure if it's there on purpose or a gag, but something we chatted about at lunch with my colleagues.  Aside from that a very easy menu to read and order.  My entree consisted of the Teriyaki Chicken Bento Box and let me tell you it did not disappoint.  Check out my picture posted to see how generous the portions were.  I didn't leave an ounce of food unfinished.  I especially really enjoyed the side salad part of my dish.  Usually the side salads at Japanese restaurants miss the beat in my opinion, but Sawa Sushi delivered ten fold.  It had a hint of thousand island and Italian vinegarett?  It was a very good dressing whatever it was, forgot to ask.  So good I've been craving it again for the last two days.  The wife had chicken potstickers and that was just as good.  Very few times do I enter a restaurant where I'm truly amazed at every dish that comes out.  All of it was delicious!  I haven't stopped thinking about come back for two days now.  I guarantee I'll see myself coming back many more times.",

I saw this place as I was about to turn around and then looked it up on Yelp and figured, what the heck, it was already 9pm but on Sunday they were still open.   i was immediately greeted by 2 sushi chefs in traditional Japanese style like you mostly get in Japan.  I told them you give me what you suggest.  They gave the DHA roll and it was great, the other roll was very nice. the rainbow roll wasn't the best, they use imitation crab which isn't my favorite.  I also had some squid salad that was nice. For 3 rolls and some fresh sashimi I was bursting and couldn't nearly finish it all but with a beer, a free saki under $50 out the door is pretty good.  I wanted to give them 5 but the Rainbow roll at the end locked in 4, but this place for Las Vegas is seriously good, it is a hole in the wall but worth finding. If I'd bought this much sushi at a srtip hotel it would have 2x and no better.",

Hopefully I get by one more time before I head home. Food and service is Fast, Friendly & Fresh! The interior is nice, clean, quiet and with an unassuming atmosphere. I really like cooked sushi so, that is what I had here. The menu has a good selection of both raw and cooked plus the other usual items. Yes it is located in a strip center but the food is perfectly prepared, presented and oh so delicious! Extra bonus at lunch I sat at the bar and got to enjoy the Chef who was singing along to the Pop R&B music (very well I might add) and just loving life!",

As a matter of fact,  Sapporo was the first thing I ordered.   Unfortunately,  they ran out of Sapporo.   What a bummer... that's ok cuz I decided to take a bento box to go and drink my own beer at home (cheaper).    I ordered the teryaki beef bento box and added an order of  spicy tuna roll.  They did not hold back on the amounts.   Geez, for under $20 I felt I came out winner.   Teriyaki sauce and tempura sauce were on point.  Didn't care too much for the salad and the california roll.  Everything else is what I expect of a bomb bento box; vegetable and shrimp tempura,  miso soup and rice.     My goto spot for Japanese take home for sure.  I suggest calling your order in instead of waiting.   Gets uncomfortable waiting for food to go when there isn't a waiting area.       I'll give another review when I actually eat there but definitely going to call first to make sure they got Sapporo.   Can't imagine stuffing myself with sushi without it.",

    "text": "Sawa Sushi just opened up not too long ago and I decide to give it try. (FYI this visit was back in March.) Any hoot and holler I always thought the location was an odd choice to open up a sushi place because it's not the busiest shopping center but hey let's hope it helps attract business.   The small Resturant was just that \"small\" as soon as you open the door you have to duck under this Japanese curtain thing they have over the front of the door whenever entering or existing the establishment which is kindda in the way in my opinion. Staff greets you immediately and you don't go far to be seated. There is a sushi bar with pull up stool in the back right corner of the Resturant which makes up most of the place and table with booth type seating on either safe of the room.   The menu is simple with quit a few options to tickle your taste buds. I came with my pregnant wife and 1 year old daughter. So naturally we asked for cooked sushi roll suggestions and the waitress was more then helpful.   We order a few Special sushi to receive a free roll and a Teriyaki chicken bento box. Ok so it is pretty awesome to find a good, affordable place to grab a quick bento box I mean this box is a perfect fix and comes with all the goodies. Teriyaki chicken, rice, salad, tempura veggies and shrimp and a good size sushi roll. A great portion of food all for about $11 or $12 on top of that you get a cup of miso soups as well. With had a great taste with small bits of tofu floating in it.   Besides the curtains in the entrance all in all it was a good little joint that I will defiantly come back to. The food was good, the Resturant was nice and the staff was friendly. Please come and try them I would love for them to stick around.   Good luck Sawa Sushi hope you are here for a long time!",

NO SAKE and NO BEER.They say they are waiting for their liquor license... So maybe that will change. * They do not have fountain sodas, only bottles. * They have Pepsi products. (I like diet Coke)  SUSHI Seaweed Salad - It was tasty but extremely small. It was the size of a seaweed salad you would expect at an AYCE (about a half cup, maybe less), but it was $4.50. For that price I would expect a good sized portion.  Las Vegas Roll - Deep fried rice. I like deep fried rolls but I like them when the rice is on the inside of the seaweed. The rice here is on the outside, there is a lot of it, and a lot of tempura. There is a small amount of salmon and cream cheese on the inside. I felt like I was eating fried dough, not sushi.  Ichiban Roll - The garlic sauce tasted nice, but lots of rice.  Oishi Roll - Yummy, but small and lots of rice.  This place adds rice to rolls and portions their items as if it is an AYCE, but it is NOT. For $12+ rolls, I expect better quality and quality of fish. They have a special going on now, buy 2 special rolls get one free, but you can go down the street to Ohjah and get their 3 roll special for the same price (and they serve large seaweed salads and sake at Ohjah)  There was one lady at the place talking about how much she loved it and how she had been there multiple times, but she also asked the waitress what NIGIRI was..? So she obviously has not had much sushi. Otherwise, we were on only customers there.  SERVICE The waitresses were nice and quick, but the place was dead.  This place might be okay if they were an AYCE and you were ok with lots of rice, or if they had a happy hour, but definitely not a la carte at their current prices. There are so many better options.",

I liked our waitress for her attentive and friendliness. I could also tell that the sushi chef we got to see at their opening hour likes to recognize his regulars. He even acknowledges patrons seated away from the sushi bar. Granted that the restaurant is small for size.  We didn't get to eat a lot 'cause I wasn't very hungry that day, but I did enjoy the Red Volcano sushi the most.  In terms of pricing, we spent about $37-$40 (not including gratuity) for 3 rolls, 1 seaweed salad and 2 waters. Trust me when I say that I went easy during this meal. I'll update after our next visit when I'll grub down more.",

    "text": "It's time for you to hire a new chef. Tonight we heard repeatedly that the chef is new. I would give you zero stars if that was an option.   My husband and I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki and Tempura Bento boxes. I ordered the yellow tail collar for my daughter (13). We ordered soda and tea for each of us as well. $12.95 bento boxes x2, $9.95 yellow tail collar, and $1.99 drinks x3. Not worth it.   We waited for almost an hour for our food to be served. People that had entered before us (they ordered sushi) were finished before we were served our food!   Finally the two bento boxes came out. FYI: they do not have regular soy sauce. The rice was delicious. The California rolls were good. The salad was yummy. However, not all was great. Like, the lack of tempura in my bento box. There were 4 pieces of what looked like donuts with a vegetable in them. They were either oily and doughy, or oily and over cooked. Then there was the fact that they missed the shrimp tempura completely. On a bright note, my husbands bento box had all the pieces. The teriyaki chicken would have been better if it was hot, not luke warm.   The yellow tail collar eventually came out. The yellow tail was meaty, but the center was cold. I could see there was uncooked spots but fed my daughter enough of the cooked spots.   At this point, our food had come out and the servers who were very polite had to hear my complain. They repeatedly stated that the chef was new and that he was confused. Our server contacted the owner, Steven, and tried to get the entire bill erased. But -- that didn't happen. He did take off the yellow tail collar.   It's time for a new chef because you'll lose your customers with this kind of food that you're serving.",

In a sense i'm glad no more having to find ways to hide my last few pieces in miso soup bowls or flattening them under two plates hahaha oh boy.... My friend wanted to get some sushi, and she saw sawa and guys it is sowwwaaa  Setting: A decaying \"grand opening sign\" is latched on the back of the restaurant, its right by the in n out on blue diamond. When you first walk in, they have that japanese mini curtain hit you in the face which my first instinct is \"this is covered with face and dirty hair\" so careful of that when you walk in. Pretty standard looking with the sushi bar and a few tables around.  Service: We had a younger white female server that just dropped off the menus to our table and walked away. So i was like ok.... morale here is bad. A different asian lady had come by later who provided better service by just being cordial. They had served as cucumber salad, and i asked if i could just seaweed or just anything else (i had cucumbers) and the chef had told the server he would charge me to replace it. Not a big deal but it would've been appreciated if he had accommodated.   Food: They have deals here if you buy 2 rolls you get 1 free but I am not a roll eater whatsoever, so we got the Sawa Boat. $40 boat (chef selection of fish) but we were served standard pieces of nigiri and sashimi (tuna, salmon, yellowtail). The quality of the fish was pretty decent.   Overall: Don't come here. It's really below average with nothing about it to spark any interests.",

So we checked Yelp! and found Sawa.   It was in a shopping center so I wasn't so sure but we were starving so in we go. The sushi chefs are so friendly & welcoming! I'm getting more confident! And if you get a large Soporo, you get a free saki! That really says welcome!! Steven was our guy. He was fast & they were made well.   Big menu with all the standard sushi selections. We started with 2 nigiri salmon (me) & 1 nigiri red snapper (him). The pieces aren't huge but a good one bite (2 for me). The salmon was very good-favorite and the red snapper was topped with a very tart marinade-not my favorite.   My husband also got a Bento Box with chicken teriyaki. It also came with salad-good but needed more dressing, miso soup- so delicious we got one to go , 2 pieces shrimp tempura-good crunch & excellent flavor & 2 pieces vegetable tempura-amazing (the sweet potato-YUM-another favorite! It also came with a scoop of rice & a California roll (which we don't normally get but was really good!)  I also got a spicy tuna roll. The nori was too chewy like it had been open too long but the flavor was still ok.  The beer & saki, 3 nigiri sushi, HUGE bento box of food, the roll & extra miso soup to go came to $50. Good price for all the food we got. Maybe not the biggest or best we've had but good- food 3.5, Steven 4.5 so round to 4. We were full  & definitely will come back.",

We told the server about this at the end and she just laughed and walked away (she was quite pleasant during the meal, maybe it was a nervous laugh, after all she doesn't make the food). We've ordered lots of Chirashi Bowls in the past and this one was by far the worst. Advice to the owners - please don't be so stingy with the amount of fish in the Chirashi Bowl going forward.",

    "text": "I was excited to have another Sushi place nearby.  I was disappointed they did not offer AYCE....but that's ok.  I have not had a good bento box in a long time.  Let's see how they do.   I ordered HOT GREEN TEA to drink and it came warm.  In fact barely warm.  I could barely taste the tea- tasted more like just water.  Started with CALAMARI and it came like onion rings.  No tentacles- and the only dipping sauce they gave with it was this tabasco looking thing.  My son had YAKITORI and it was hardly tasty.  It was good it had sauce on it.  My Godfather ordered this this SUSHI COMBO.  We both had MISO SOUP....it lacked taste but at least it was hot.  It tasted like those instant MISO SOUP you add water to and like too much water was added.  My BENTO BOX- omg...the so-called Grilled Beef Teriyaki ...looked like wet beef- no taste.  The salad was your typical mixed greens and the  dressing is really important and that was like it was mayo mix IDK what flavoring it had.  The Tempura: Shrimp looked like it was on the skinny side, one tiny sweet potato, one tiny broccoli and I think a small zucchini.  The Tempura dipping sauce- it was not watered down correctly because it was too strong, and too sweet.  The Cali Rols was ok.   I would have ordered more to see if maybe something else might have been good...but at this point I was already turned off.  I usually try a place a couple of times just in case they were having a bad day with their service or whatever but BLEH!",

They currently have a deal of buy two special rolls and get the third free.   No, it doesn't have AYCE  nor do they have a happy hour. Not every sushi bar in Las Vegas needs to be AYCE!  It is fairly average-priced for a sushi bar, but the quality certainly appeared to be excellent.  We spent roughly $40 for four large rolls and hot tea (before tip). Roughly $10 less than AYCE - but we still left full and it was better quality than most AYCE places.",

I  know we ordered the ichiban, Krabby patty, lobster roll, and I can't remember the last. They were all good though!   Definitely a good lunch to start off our trip!",

I literally couldn't taste anything in any of my food except their disgusting orange vinegar sauce. It's an Americanized sushi restaurant for sure. Great people, horrible fish/sushi.",

Great roll special (buy 2 get one). Prices are great. Two people can eat for under $40 and walk out comfortably full.   My favorite sushi spot in Vegas. By far.  And I eat sushi like a champ.   Go here. You won't be disappointed.  :)",

The place is small, but the ambiance is nice. There is a small sushi bar towards the back and tables in the rest of the space. There was only 1 waitress, but she was prompt on serving us.   My husband ordered a Tonkotsu Ramen, and I ordered the Tuna Tataki. My sushi came out about 5 minutes before his ramen, so I waited for his until I started eating.  I loved the tataki. The sauce had just enough of a kick to make the dish appetizing but didn't make the taste unbearable. There were 12 pieces, which for $13 (I think) is a deal. The tuna was on top of a bed of rice noodles and they were also delicious.  My husband's ramen was a bit plain. There was no egg, no hearts of palm, no seaweed, no pickled ginger, none of the regular items you usually find in tonkotsu ramen. On the upside, the pieces of meat in the soup were very generous. He ordered his spicy, and said the same as my dish, that it was just spicy enough to make the dish taste really good. He was disappointed though about not having an egg and asked for one on the side. They apparently didn't have any boiled so he ended up finishing his soup before our waitress came back over and apologized that the egg would be another 5-10 minutes. She offered him another piece of pork, but he passed on it since he was already finished with his soup.  Overall, we may be back when we come into town again, but he won't be getting the soup.",

The mussels were burned like rubber, yakitori was actually the highlight!   When I ordered the boat, I specifically asked if they include some Cajun tuna...not one came with it! So disappointed, asked for a ponzu sauce, server gave us some chili garlic sauce! Ordered the Sapporo w/ free house sake, never came!!!

I was told after I'd piled all our dishes together and asked if I wanted the free one!  Regardless the food was really good.  My toddler had the kids chicken yakitori which came with 2 scoops of rice and some veggies on the side.  She ate almost everything , which is unusual.

Make two purchases of a sushi order and you get one for free!!! And when you order a large Sapporo you get a large hot sake! I am truly in love with this place. I'm glad I found a better sushi restaurant in Vegas. The bathrooms are clean, and a sushi bar is very clean as well. They have two TVs so you can watch sports. Or you can zone out on the elevator style of relaxing music. Seriously no complaints whatsoever.  Overall: 10 out of 10  Red",

    "text": "I recently moved to Las Vegas and my wife & I are setting up our new \"Go To\" list of restaurants. I put AYCE (all you can eat) into my Yelp search engine and wa-la Sawa Sushi came up nearby.   Let's start by stating that Sawa Sushi does NOT have AYCE fare. Instead they have a bunch of rolls that - you buy 2 of and a 3rd one is free. Hmmmmm? How many people want three rolls of the same thing? That's another issue that didn't really affect me.  I ordered the Chicken Teriyaki Bento Box, Fried Gyoza, & Eel roll.   All great sushi starts with the rice. It's not the same as rice used in a rice bowl. It is sweeter, and stickier than normal rice. This is to enhance the filler and keep it together while you eat it. Both my eel roll and the California roll from my Bento box fell apart when picking it up with chopsticks. The rice had the same flavor/texture as the scoop of rice in the Bento. Not good! The rolls had a good flavor but did not hit the mark.  The chicken teriyaki was moist and flavorful, but the portion and appearance was less than ideal. The tempura shrimp/vegetables were well prepared and flavorful.  The fried gyoza was the prize of the meal. They were well prepared and larger than normal. There was also 6 pieces as compared to most restaurant's 5 pieces. The dipping sauce had a nice bite to it. Just enough to make itself known and enhance the food.  The high point of the meal was the service. Our waitress was efficient, friendly, and thorough. She was almost too much. As soon as we might need anything, drinks, napkins, etc she was there!   I gave this restaurant 4 stars as an average between the food (3 stars) and service (5 stars).",

    "text": "On Sunday I was craving sushi but didn't want to pay a ridiculous delivery fee to Postmates or DoorDash. I had seen some really positive reviews about Sawa Sushi and I was pretty happy about how close to me house it was. So I went with some good company to see what was up.   First thing I saw when I got there was a buy 2 get 1 free deal going for their special rolls. That was all I needed to know to continue my adventure into the building. When we got in, I was immediately at peace. Sawa has a nice, intimate feel and wasn't too loud or crowded (though that might be because we beat the after church rush). The nice hostess sat us at the bar where we noticed the next great thing: free hot sake with the purchase of a Sapporo beer. I'm not a beer drinker but my company is a fan of Sapporo so it worked out. When his beer came... it was a humongous bottle, not like the smallish ones you get everywhere else. The sake was delicious and smooth.  We ended up ordering the green mussels appetizer which was surprisingly spicy but the spice was more than welcomed. I love spicy food so that was a plus in my book. I ordered the baked spicy lobster roll and the garlic albacore roll. AH-MAZ-ING! The spicy lobster roll was basically an orgasm in my mouth and I will definitely be ordering it again many times. The garlic albacore was really great too. I really didn't even need the soy sauce or other condiments in order to eat it, it was just that good on its own.  Aside from the great food, the chef and the hostess/waitress were very attentive and accommodating. The chef struck up a conversation with us and was just a pleasant spirit to have preparing our food. Sawa Sushi will definitely be a permanent fixture in my foodie rotation and I recommend making them a part of yours.",

If you have never tried real wasabi you need to ask and it is better than the fake paste, trust me you will like it.  If you order the Large Sapporo Beer you get a free house Saki...also they have really wonderful Gingo Saki it is filtered Cold and delish...

    "text": "Today's lunch stop was to Sawa Sushi, a place that husband wanted to check out after seeing positive reviews on Yelp.   I'm not the finicky self-described sushi snob that my husband professes to be, but I can always find something good to eat at places like this.  We entered the establishment during their lunch period and was greeted/sat by our pleasant server.  Husband was a little disappointed by the lack of standard iced tea (only green iced or hot tea) availability and settled for a Pepsi.  I had the iced green tea.  We placed our order from the lunch menu, each of us ordering the chicken teriyaki bento box with a side of fried gyoza.  Husband ordered an additional eel roll for himself.  Our miso soup was brought out and soon thereafter, our plate of crunchy gyoza's.  Both were delicious.  Curiously, the dip for the gyoza had a slight \"bite\" at the end, making it a surprise and making me wanting more.  Once our bento boxes were delivered, but I was a bit put off by the lack of teriyaki sauce covering the chicken.  I would have liked to have all pieces of my chicken generously tossed and covered in teriyaki, not just the center pieces having the sauce quickly squirted on.  The edges were bare naked grayish brown cooked chicken.  The teriyaki sauce beneath the bed of cabbage (beneath the chicken) was of help so I could scoop some sauce with the bare chicken pieces.  The salad was topped with a nice creamy \"Japanese Ranch\" dressing, which I found pleasant.  Overall, the bento box combo was delicious and I had a great lunch.  Our server was friendly, spot on when it came time for drink refills and efficient in her table visits.  I would definitely like to return to this place.",

Not sure why I made this decision as I wanted nor dim sum rather than sushi and ended up with ramen.   When my tonkatsu ramen was served, it was a large bowl. As I  expected, there was no wow factor. I was hoping the broth was going to be good but lacked flavor. But that is what I should expect as this is not a ramen shop.   I do plan to visit again to try the sushi in hopes of raising the number of stars.   I do think that the restaurant is a little too dark even at 2 pm.   And why this review is at 3-stars and not any lower is the good customer service.",

All rolls we've never tried before and never heard of before. Not taste nothing special. Ordered bento box - ok - teriyaki just cooked with sauce poured on top and not marinated. Now their tempura was excellent and dipping sauce was good. Also tried their karage chicken - ok but sauce did not match; needs a ton/chix katsu sauce. Something else new and different - deep fried crab sticks - ok but again wrong dipping sauce and they should warn you it's spicy. Slow service for a small Restuarant. I'd rather pay more for AYCE - paid $67 for TWO people with a discount. Staff nice.",

Sawa Sushi is super close to where we're living now, and my roommate decided she wanted to have sushi for dinner, and that I was joining her last night.  Who am I to argue with a sushi date?!  Sawa is a small restaurant that is open, well lit, and very clean.   It has a few tables and a small sushi bar with seats.  We opted to sit at the bar.  We ordered the Sawa Boat, which was chef's choice of 9 pieces of sashimi, 6 pieces of nigiri, and 2 special rolls, with a cucumber salad.    We received:  Super white, Tuna, and Salmon for both nigiri and sashimi, and also had yellow tail nigiri.   For the special rolls we chose a Rainbow roll and the snow white roll, both with no avocado.    Let me tell you, this is some of the best sushi I've ever had.   Everything on the boat (and it was literally served on a giant wood boat.) was perfection.  They were great about avoiding the avocado, too.  We also ordered a couple things a la carte:  Uni Amaebi (with deep fried heads) Quail egg nigiri  Quail egg shooters.  Everything was absolutely delicious.   Service was impeccable.  I cannot wait to go back!!",

I was running errands in this strip mall and got hungry because that is what shopping does to me. So I spied Sawa Sushi and went inside.  First of all the Spicy tuna roll was falling apart but it tasted decent. The rice was crumbling when I was picking it up with my chopsticks and YES I know how to use chopsticks.  The fish was fresh but I like my roll to stay in tact, fresh fish or not.  My ramen also took awhile. It was 30 minutes (I checked my phone) from the time I finished my spicy tuna roll and when I got my Ramen. It was quite a wait inbetween dishes, I was starting to thin that maybe they forgot my ramen. The people who ordered after me had received all there rolls and were eating happily. I was jealous, a little,  The Tonkatsu Ramen was nothing special really, I had better at Ramen places for the price. It was just plain Tonkatsu Ramen but if I wanted Ramen I should have gone to a Ramen place, I know!  It was okay. I do not think I will be coming back to Sawa. Sorry Sawa!",

My mom just moved here from Japan (where I grew up) and I've had a really hard time finding a sushi spot that impresses her. We were both really happy tonight. Not only were the pieces really fresh but they were nice and thick as well. Looking forward to coming back. If the quality is always this good then I'd have to say that this is one of the better sushi places in town.   Update: Went back exactly one week later and ordered the same sashimi platter and the cuts were not as fresh and were not nearly as thick. It was still fresh but with the cuts being smaller, it's going to be hard spending the money on the sashimi platter again. Also the nigiri was smaller as well. I'll give it another try. They had two chefs there and I'm not sure if we had one the first week and then the other the second. Notice the slits in the nigiri in my pictures. The nigiri didn't have those the second time we went which makes me think it might have been a different chef. Hmmmm.",

Craving sushi, I revisited this location and still found good value in this meal.  An offer for buy 2 get 1 free on special rolls posted right outside the complex is what convinced me to dine here.  Special rolls average around $8.50 and up to around $13.  I had the DHA roll again, a shrimp tempura crunch, and a Philadelphia roll.   The DHA roll with spicy yellowtail inside, tuna on top, with the screaming O sauce was good.    We ordered shrimp tempura, green mussels, gyoza, and a cali roll for the kids.   All portions were good for the money.  The total came to be right at $50; good for feeding a family of four.    The restaurant was not busy at all so getting our food and server's attention was fairly fast.  An improvement from my last visit, I would return to eat here if I find myself nearby again.",

We closed the restaurant and even though late our timeliness was met with s smile and graciousness. Thank you Steven for making my 1st experience at your quaint restaurant very enjoyable.  I will tell all my friends!!! After  47 years in Vegas you will be on my radar!!! Again thank you!! And... Thanks for the smile!!!   P.S. Wen is great!!!",

There is always only one server working no matter how busy and I think once she may have also been helping in the kitchen because it took us over an hour to get our food. One visit, we gave up and just left, because we had to get to the airport and in my opinion waiting an hour for food in a restaurant with only three tables is a little ridiculous.   I'd love to give it 5 stars but the management clearly needs to hire more staff to avoid long wait time and food coming out cold.",

The moment you walk through the door, you're greeted by the booming voice of the sushi chefs hard at work creating their masterpieces. Wait staff got me seated immediately!   A personal favorite, the chu toro is quite simply brilliant! Soft, succulent & quite delightful, the chu toro is something that I'll be fantasizing about tonight.   The broad range of specialty rolls & the buy two get one free will leave you feeling stuffed. Craving spicy tuna after the chu toro I opted for the Baja roll, bonzai & spicy sea. Whilst the Baja & spicy sea delivered a little heat, neither came close to bonzai's. The siracha & jalapenos are subtle enough & meshes with the overall flavor. Their creations are for all to enjoy. Only the freshest of fish will do & sawa delivers.   With prompt service, personable sushi chefs & the freshest of fish. Sawa has found themselves a loyal fan.",

I usually come here for lunch and the lunch specials (bento box) are $8.95 or $9.95. it's never crowded there during lunch hours. The food comes out very quickly, which I like as well. They also have good specials such as buy two specialty rolls and get one free. Again, it makes this place a very good value. I don't know if I'm reading into this or not, but there seems to be an extremely high turnover rate among servers here. I don't think I've ever seen the same person twice. My only other minor gripe about this place is the very old-school Japanese music that is playing on repeat in the background. I don't think my parents would even listen to that anymore. It could be a little livelier in there but for the money, it's fine.",

I highly recommend any of them. You can taste the great quality of the fish they get. Chef Steven is also very friendly and passionate about his restaurant so just him being there creates a great atmosphere.  Unfortunately, there was one server that kinda killed he whole vibe. I read one review and it seems they've described her as well. She basically just dropped off the menu on our table and left. The older Asian lady was much, much nicer...so she saved it.   Judging overall, we'll most likely come back here. We really liked the restaurant, the food, and the chef. Feed me with some good food and engage me in some good conversation, and you've won me over.

We didn't know what to expect because it's located in a strip mall parking lot, but after reading reviews, (which were good) we decided to give it a shot and so glad we did! If you don't try this place, you ARE seriously missing out!!!",

    "text": "There are a lot of high reviews and 5 stars for this place and I am confused as to why. I in no way consider myself a Sushi snob. I even like sushi from the grocery store in a crunch.   Let me start by saying, this food here is good it just wasn't 5 star good. I have been looking for a new AYCE but haven't found one that I'm in love with so I thought I would give this place a try.   I ordered the volcano that everyone raves about and was given something else entirely. When I mentioned to the chef that I didn't think that this is what I had ordered and I thought that it had shrimp tempura in it (as opposed to the crab/mayo mix), he told me \"oh, that's something else.\" -Well, not according to the pictures on Yelp. I'll never know how good it is because I wasn't given one. I didn't hate what I got. It just wasn't my thing and unfortunately it didn't appear that I had a choice and for $13.95 I was annoyed. Look at the picture that I posted and the picture of every other volcano...  I also ordered yellowtail and scallop nigiri. Both were okay but there was too much rice and the rice seemed chilled. (NOT a good thing) Since I was still hungry, I ordered a Salmon hand roll. Again, nothing to write home about, cold rice. I spent over $40 with tip and didn't even get what I wanted.   The food was average. The atmosphere was average The service was just below average (but came with a warm smile) -and this is the kicker -  The price was above average.  I don't mind paying top dollar for top quality, presentation and atmosphere but it just wasn't there. I regret not trying out a new AYCE place instead, at least if I didn't like it much, I would have gotten to order more Nigiri, soup, salad AND a roll for less $. Overall, I've just had better.  It might be okay for the buy 2 get one free roll deal or bento boxes or various soups, but for the hardcore sushi lover, not so much....",

But when it came to paying we did two separate checks. I paid with my card and my friend went to pay with hers and the guy doing the sushi was telling her that they couldn't accept her the fee to pay for an American Express is too much. And then the guy behind the sushi bar wouldn't let us leave he kept pretending to call someone saying that they would have to charge my friend double because the fee as too expensive. Yet there was no sign anywhere stating that they don't accept American Express. He refused to let us go. And we had ordered dessert and didn't even get to eat it because the man behind he sushi bar making the sushi was so rude and refused to let us go telling her she has to pay double or call someone to come bring her money. He refused to give us his name but we went today around 3pm. Will never go back there again.",

The Volcano and Japanese Lasagne Rolls were  amazing. The awesome part is when you order two specialty rolls, you get one free. The California Rolls here are not bad. I liked the Spicy Tuna Rolls, but they kinda bored me. I'll definitely be back.",

When the waitress came, we both ordered bento boxes which were recommended. I don't like miso soup, so I asked for a double serving of the ginger salad, and the waitress said not a problem. I also ordered a Sapporo. The waitress brought out our salad and soup, and there was a creamy white dressing on my salad, I asked what it was and she stated it was a creamy dressing, I explained that I asked for ginger dressing and she ran to the back to fix. After a few minutes wait, she came back with a salad that had what looked like a soy sauce/oil dressing on it. I have to say it was absolutely awful!!! It tasted like salty, oil and dirt. I then motioned the waitress to let her know I still hadn't received my Sapporo, which I now needed to wash down the dirt taste in my mouth.   After about 15 minutes, we were served our bento boxes, which although looked appetizing had no flavor. I stopped eating and so did my friend. Within 10 minutes, both of our stomachs were turning, and we immediately left the restaurant. As of this morning, we were both up with horrible stomach pain all night, and I'm pretty sure we both have food poisoning.",

Can't beat the buy 2 get 1 free special. Bento boxes also come with a lot of food at a decent price. Overall, our experience was great and we'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "Decent choice for sushi for the southwest area.  The buy two rolls, get one free is a good deal. And in my opinion, helps balance out the small-ish portions.  The nigri portions were also a bit small, but made up for by its freshness and buttery texture.  Service was prompt, attentive, without being intrusive.   Place seemed to attract some regulars, which is always a positive sign.   Just wish their mug for their hot tea came with a handle. When the tea is piping hot, the handle-less design of the mug made it difficult to drink the tea without scalding your hand/fingers. Oh well.",
