    "text": "Atmosphere, Service and Food!  This place hits the marks on all three, from the moment that you enter the place you feel instantly relaxed, like your in an old mexican cantina, the service is top-notch! very team oriented, from the second that you take your seat a server is getting your drinks while another  is bringing you chips with two types of dips which are both awesome btw followed by yet another person with tomato soup! really well orientated. The food is delicious, I've had the fish tacos and camarones adelita there both great! bursting with flavor served in oversized portions, come hungry and be prepared to roll out of this place. My only gripe is the prices which can be a little on the high side, the camarones adelita is almost in the $20 range.  All in all, some of the best Mexican food I've ever had.",

    "text": "We were driving through on our way to Salt Lake City and stumbled across Viva Zapatas.  It was a wonderful find.  It seems to be a big favourite of locals, as it was almost full on a Sunday at 11:00 am.  Chips were brought to the table with salsa and bean dip.  The chips are so fresh, no mistaking them for store bought, and the dips truly tasty (salsa was a bit spicy).  We had Huevos Machaca with corn tortillas, so much meat that it was hard to find the eggs.  It was very tasty but I would have enjoyed a little more pico de gallo to add some texture.  Definitely worth the detour off the I-15",

    "text": "I recently visited Zapatas on my latest visit to North Vegas. I went on a Friday night around 830 and YES this place had a very long wait. The parking area is pretty big which is a plus and its very good access for entering and exiting. My only complaint was there is hardly any place to sit when you are waiting for your food. There are two small benches on the inside and maybe two on the outside.  Most people sit in their car or on the little stoop outside the restaurant. Upon entering I was greeted by two lovely hostesses who gave me a menu since I wanted to take my food to go. I decided to sit at the bar and order my food. The bartender was amazing...................although they don't have a drink menu they have a FULLY STOCKED BAR......with some of the best tequila hands down. I had the Peach Margarita first and the alcohol was not scarce :-D. After less than 5 minutes of sitting at the bar we were given Chips, Salsa, and bean dip with cheese. It was so delicious and the chips were fresh and crunchy. The salsa had a little kick to it but I love things spicy...........  Around 20 minutes later I received my food.......I ordered Shrimp and Steak tacos with a side of Chicken tamales...........The steak tacos were pretty good the meat was flavorful and the tortillas were soft..........i did not care for the salsa that came with the tacos  but it wasn't bad........The Shrimp tacos were the highlight of my meal....the shrimp was plump and had just the right seasoning on them .......I immediately fell in love I wish I would have ordered more...... the onions and lettuce was fresh as well .....I don't think I have had shrimp tacos that were that good in a long time.......the tamales were good I wish it had more sauce on them but not too bad......they also came with olives on them which were pretty good. Overall I give this place a 4.......definitely worth coming back for a night out with the ladies for some good food and awesome drinks! If you are near Nellis AFB you surely have to try this place out!",

    "text": "My Son and I were in the area volunteering at Three Square and decided to stop by here during our lunch break.  The parking lot was packed and we had to wait around 10 min for our table....this was at 12:10 pm, the worst time to be heading to lunch.  The wait was worth it though.  Once we were seated we browsed the menu and decided to order the Queso Fundido w/Chorizo appetizer ($6.95), Beef & Bean Chimichanga lunch special ($8.25), and Pollo Amador lunch special ($10.25).  I also asked the waiter if the cook could put together a really spicy Habanero Salsa for us....he said sure.    We were served complimentary Chips, Salsa, and Beans while we waited for our food....+1.  The Salsa reminded me of the Salsa at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  I read the menu that had the story of Zapata, but couldn't find any connection between the restaurants.....the Salsa was that close to one another.  Anyway, it was really good.....had a nice kick to it.  The Chips weren't as fresh as I like them to be....but they were good.  After a short wait our Queso Fundido came out....again, it reminded me of the one at Lindo/Bonito Michoacan.  It was very delicious.  On top of the dish is an extremely hot Pepper....I think it's a grilled Jalapeno or Poblano (see pics)....whatever it is, I like it.  I ordered the Beef & Bean Chimichanga and it came out a few minutes later....along with the Habanero Salsa.  The Beef was shredded and very delicious, not greasy.  Sometimes when you order a Beef Chimichanga it can be very greasy....not here.  It was a nice size too.....must be their lunch portion.  The Habanero Salsa was really spicy....just how I like it!  It added to the flavor.  My dish also came with Guacamole & Sour Cream and a side of Refried Beans & Rice.....all very good.  My Son enjoyed his Pollo Amador.  He gave me a bite to try it out.  It is Chicken marinated in Amador Sauce (whatever that is).  The Sauce had a slightly sweet tomatoey flavor to it.....it was very good.  Overall, it was a nice lunch.  Will we return?  If we're in the area and in the mood for some Mexican Food....you can count on it.",

The front desk staff, the wait staff, and the bus staff were all extremely friendly and helpful. The food is prepared quickly and I am always able to get in and out for lunch in less than 45 minutes. When I have a big group the staff always accommodates us and we always leave satisfied. I will continue to support this wonderful business and I will always recommend it to my friends!",

It was quite crowded for a Sunday night.   I ordered the shrimp enchiladas and sangria. My husband had the beef tongue tacos. They give you as much chips and dips as you want, and our order also came with a delicious tomato noodle soup.   All of the food was delicious: Zapata's food is one of the best Mexican foods I have had. Whenever I get the munchies for Mexican food, I know where to come from now on.

I can't stand the touristy mexican food on the strip so we were excited to try this small place off the beaten path in North Vegas. We went to Viva Zapatas based on positive Yelp reviews and recommendations from the locals and this place did not disappoint. If you are asking yourself if this place is worth the 20 minute drive from the strip, my answer is emphatically \"HELL YES!\" The tableside Guac is crazy awesome, fresh homemade hot tortillas and chips. Bean dip, salsa and soup are complementary too! I had the carne asada plate and it was on-par with the best I've had in San Diego. She had the Shrimp Fajitas and they were plump, grilled to perfection and plentiful. We will be visiting again soon.",

I had the carne asada and highly recommend it. It was tender, juicy, and cooked just right. The staff was really friendly but it seemed like they were shorthanded and it was fairly busy. All in all I'd definitely go back for the carne asada, however I wouldnt call it one of my top 5.",

After returning to Las Vegas from golfing at Wolf Creek I happened to stop for gas at a seven eleven and asked the lady behind the counter if she could recommend a good Mexican restaurant. Of course she directed me a mile up the road to Zapatas. There were no large tables available so they sat me across from the bar at a little two seater table. The chips salsa and beans practically followed me to the table....amazingly quick service. The wait staff offered service with a smile and the food was delectable! The offerings are so vast I had trouble deciding between a burrito or the pollo a cognac. The waiter steered me towards the chicken dish and I wasn't disappointed. The creamy sauce was out of this world and the chicken was tender and sauteed with onions and mushrooms. I was pleased to stumble upon this local gem and you better believe I will go out of my way to return on my next trip to sin city!",

I had a Carne Asada dish and  it was spectacular. The meat was tender and very well seasoned. the environment inside the restaurant was quite enjoyable. The decoration is very traditional and cultural. The service was impeccable as well. The food was delivered relatively promptly considering it is made to order. The dishes didn't seem rushed. Each dish was carefully and cleanly served. I highly recommend this place for anyone who wants an authentic Mexican taste.",

I had never had enchiladas that were filled with shredded beef. My honey absolutely loved his food also. We were almost going to ask for someone to roll us out...that's how much we ate. I will admit that the sopapillas were a little thicker than what I'm used to but still very good. Definitely recommended!!",

The salsa is thicker and slightly spicy - delish.   Margaritas are some of the best that you will let past your lips. Whether you prefer frozen or on the rocks, they are delightful and hard to refuse a refill.   Fideo soup. Fideo soup! This soup will keep you coming back for more, as they have truly ramped up the flavor. It is perfectly clear that they have poured love into the broth. It's delicious!  Do not get the tacos al pastor if you want to be able to eat them somewhere else. The flavor is knock-you-on-your-ass good. The meat bursts on your tastebuds just before the pineapple sweetness starts to tango. It's phenomenal. I will never be able to order this anywhere else.   The service was impeccable. The staff constantly checking and asking you how you are enjoying it, refilling beverages and truly interested in your visit. They will box your food for you, and everything is fine with a genuine smile. The live music on Friday nights brings together the circle of authenticity.   So where is the fifth star? In the non-existent parking lot. This is the only improvement that needs to be made. We parked at the gas station, and we're lucky to get the last spot on the whole block.   We're stoked that this place is right down the street from us, cuz we will be back - frequently!",

The salsa is very different from what we are used to but, we really enjoyed it. The side of refried beans to eat with your chips was a nice touch as was the soup. Service was excellent and the food was excellent. Prices were higher than most Mexican restaurants but the quality made up for it. We felt we got what we paid for.",

A complimentary cup of Fideo Soup was a nice prelude to a veritable Mexican feast after downing also complimentary warm homemade Tortilla Chips in a mellow Bean Dip and spicy hot Red Salsa.  A made to order Guacamole Dip prepared tableside by our wiatress was excellent with a freshly opened avocado and just the right amount of lime, cilantro, and other seasoning.  White Onions, Jalapeno Peppers, and pieces of tomato enhanced this yummy dish.  Next up for me was a 17 Tecala Combination Plate, consisting of a suitably soft Chile Relleno and a fine Green Chile Pork & Bean Burrito, along with a Shredded Beef Taco prepared with a requested crunchy hard shell that was ordered ala carte.  The beef was a little soggy; otherwise everything was tasty.  To help fill the gut were included Refritos and Mexican Rice.  Diane enjoyed a large Shrimp Quesadilla executed with a Flour Tortilla, melted Cheddar Cheese, and cut up pieces of shrimp.  Our meal was accompanied by fine guitar music and singing.  Service was friendly, quick, and excellent all around.  Water glasses were repeatedly refilled without request.  4-1/2 stars overall!  I will surely be back!",

Also the chips, salsa and bean dip that was great as well. I had the Enchilada, Taco and Burrito combo. This was good, only drawback was kinda room temperature, not hot.

Bartender is awesome, super friendly, and she even brought out some chips and salsa for us to snack on while we had a beer and waited for our table.  Somehow the hostess got confused and forgot we were waiting at the bar and marked us off the list, but we got it all resolved.    The food, oh my goodness, the food is muy delicioso!  It took a little while to come out, but it was well worth the wait.  I had the sizzling fajitas de camarones with their yumazing handmade flour tortillas and he had the pollo estilo reforma agraria, which is a vinegar marinaded chicken dish.  We also loved that they have a lot of huevos dishes not limited to breakfast hours.  And like other yelpers have noted, the parking lot is tiny.  Knowing this ahead of time helped me mentally prepare to be patient and creative with my parking options.",

The food is always great and they keep the homemade chips and salsa/bean dip coming.  If you order guac, they make it right at the table.  They usually offer a complimentary cup of soup as well.  What I really love about Zapatas is that they always accommodate my picky food needs and never make me feel badly about it.  The service is top notch!  They also have one of the best margaritas in Vegas!  They have a great happy hour from 2p.m.-6:00 p.m. (I think) M-F with 2 for 1 drinks - you can't beat it!  I love the live music every night and since they are located so close to the Galaxy Theater in the Cannery, it's the perfect date night restaurant too!  The restaurant is a bit hard to find since they are in the same lot as a gas station (if you are coming off of the Craig Rd. exit on 95 - turn towards Pecos Road and you can't miss it) but I promise, it's worth it!  Zapatas is definitely an Eastside hidden gem!",

When the food arrived I was surprise with a piece of meat that was so small I was unable to classify the cut the server said it is a 4 ounce piece but I would hesitate to say it was more than 2 ounces. We spoke to the manager and they reiterated that it was the right size I refused to pay and just stuck with my chilaquiles.

Bland, overpriced, tasteless are just a few of the adjectives I'd use to describe  'Viva's' food. I'm sorry, but refried beans and pre-cooked rice are not authentic Mexican. Unless you consider Del Taco authentic. If you do, I feel sorry for you.  They were busy, and we waited for half an hour. That is not a complaint. Just a fact.  Once seated the waiter appeared quickly to take our drink order. (Margaritas) Those were fine. Chips and salsa soon followed. Salsa was as bland as the refried beans that came at the same time.  The menu is extensive, but I'd venture a guess not much different than what we ordered. Bland.  I had a combo with beef, ( had a huge blob of fat in the middle) pork in a salsa verde (green salsa) and a very greasy chicken taco. With of course, red rice and beans.  My fiance had chicken enchiladas in a flavorless green sauce. To be fair, she enjoyed the rice.   Save some money, go to the Del Taco.",

The menu is large, items are  priced a bit higher than I prefer, but the portions are huge. I've enjoyed their quesadillas with shrimp, avocado shells stuffed with shrimp and pico, and most of all the fideo. Honestly, I always came for beer and fideo. I felt the fish and shrimp tacos were quite bland, and the burritos are packed with way too much meat and nothing else.  The service is always friendly. It gets very busy here, so beware of that.

Chips, beans, and ridiculously good salsa shop up at the table right after being seated. drink order taken immediately. Their staff worked together to keep us happy. Our drinks never saw the bottom of the cup. I appreciated that because there's nothing more annoying than the wait staff letting your cup sit empty while your trying to wash down your meal.   I had the carnitas fajitas with corn tortilla. These were THE BEST carnitas I have had in my life this far. Incredible flavor! My bf had shredded beef tacos with the crunch shell. He really enjoyed it.   They also have a little station in the corner of the restaurant where they have a lady making fresh flour and corn tortillas. I haven't tried the flour so I can't comment on those. But the corn tortillas are amazing too. The best.   I look forward to visiting this place again.",

Overall, the best part is the waiters in the restaurant, incredible service and you can bet on never having to wait for drink refills.",

You get bottomless chips so be careful and save room for the delicious pork, beef, chicken and seafood options Viva's menu offers.  NOTE: parking is limited especially during busy hours, additional parking can be found behind Zapatas.   Staff: courteous and friendly   Seating: only indoor, plenty of room for large parties. Bar area has stools and seating for approximately 20 people.   Full bar, lots of tequila brands.   Dress code: casual   Menu: lots of options! I've never had a bad meal here. I'm a big fan of the carne asada, and the chimichanga.    Service: the service is usually quick, but at peak hours (lunch) you may have a little bit of a wait.  Make sure you've got more than an hour to eat, if you're going to stop by at lunch time.   Bottom line, if you're looking for good Mexican food this should be one of your stops.",

    "text": "My darling husband had the brilliant idea of going to get Mexican for breakfast on Saturday.  He had stopped here during the week one day while we were moving and was pretty impressed.  I couldn't wait to try it.   We arrived bright and early, since they open at 9:00am.   We were greeted right away, and shown to our seats.   Our server, Jesus, was fast, polite, and very friendly.  We liked him a lot.    They bring out chips, salsa, and refried beans, which were all awesome.  The salsa had this amazing smokiness to it, with a good heat, and nice, thick (but not chunky, if that makes sense) consistency.    I ordered the chicken and beef enchilada, served with beans and rice.   The enchilada was great.  Both meats were shredded, tender, and full of flavor.   Smothered in delicious cheese, too.   The beans were good too.  The rice wasn't anything to write home about.  Kind of bland, and they put lima beans in it, which is really weird.    Fella had a chili verde burrito and chile rellenos.  WOWZA.  Both of these were delicious.  The Chile relleno was a little too spicy for me, but he loved it.   We will most definitely be back, I need to try a margarita!!",

    "text": "First time posting on Yelp. As a former waiter, I am generally very understanding. I went to this place because it looked good, seemed pretty authentic when I walked. Menu is fairly robust.  Ordered some Don Julio 1942 tequila. Typically $25 - $35 a glass. They sent me a glass of some cheap liquor. Perhaps they thought I wouldn't notice. No one who orders Don Julio 1942 would not be able to tell the difference. I had to have it exchanged.   Asked for some pico de gallo, never got any. Ordered ceviche, it took well over 10 minutes to get to me. This was pretty good, portion was large. Ordered cheese enchiladas in mole sauce and a side of guacamole. About 20 minutes later, the busser came by and started to remove the chips, etc. He asked me if I was done, I said, no, I haven't gotten my dinner yet. Another 10 - 15 minutes later they drop the plate and leave. Food is on the border of being burnt. And, I have no fork.  Eventually I am able to flag someone down for a fork, and start to eat. Cheese enchiladas are filled with chicken. I set it aside a wait again for my waiter.  Mind you, when I sat down, there were only two other tables, and at least two servers. Two 3 tops got seated after me plus a table of about 6-7 local police. Plenty of coverage that I shouldn't be ignored for 15 minutes at a clip.  Busser finally comes by, starts to take my plate, asking if I am done. I say no, I would like the meal I ordered. 5 minutes later, my waiter comes by to see what's wrong. I explain the food is wrong, he sets out to get it fixed.  At this point I've been there for an hour, and have been served the wrong thing twice. I go find my waiter, tell him to forget it, as I am concerned what the kitchen will send out. I tell him I will pay for what I ate/drank, but do not want wait to see what the kitchen sends out or how long it might take.  Go up and pay, waiter says he is going to get the manager. AFTER I pay. So I wait for a few minutes. I asked the hostess, \"was he getting the manager\"? I thought I might have misheard. She said yes, told me he'd be along in a few minutes. And then the topper - she said \"why, do you have someplace you need to go\"?  I said, yes, I need to go get some dinner. Jeez.  Some of the food I got was good. Service sucked. I will not go back.",

Ay yai yai!! Annnd, they were actually tasty...not too much sweet and sour, just the right amount! Unfortunately there are no HH food special (tear). : (   Coming from San Diego, it has been difficult to find authentic Mexican food, but Viva Zapatas was one of the better ones I've found so far in Vegas.  I ordered the taco plate with beans and rice. Unfortunately I can't recall the three different taco meats I ordered, but I remember all of them being tasty. The rice was prepared well, but my favorite were the refried beans and homemade chips they brought out when we sat down...yummy!!! Another traditional touch that I appreciated was the fideo soup that accompanied my meal. I could have slurped that soup all night....delicious!!   The ambiance was enjoyable as well. Traditional colors and decor with classic Mexican tunes in the background. I believe the server mentioned that they have occasional live musical performances, so if that peaks your interest I would call prior to confirm. The service was good, nothing above and beyond, but certainly friendly. The only downside of this place is that it is fairly pricey for traditional Mexican food. Thank goodness for their HH margarita specials!",

    "text": "It was pouring when we came here, but yet it was super busy. My two friends and I came on a Sunday night, around 6:30 or so and someone held the door for us and welcomed us in. It was really dark inside, which made it kind of difficult to read the menu (the words were small too) but the booths were comfy, it was warm and the music was good. We were given chips, salsa and beans while we waited for our server.   My friends ordered a large margarita which was surprisingly good and very strong. After our server took our drink orders and dropped off our waters, he disappeared for 10 minutes. I am not exaggerating, waiting 10 minutes to order is not acceptable. My friends were sure he forgot about us.   Finally, we were able to order our food but by then we had already filled up on chips and salsa (the busboy refilled it for us twice already). Instead of ordering the chicken enchilada, chicken taco and tamale combo I got the beef enchilada and tamale combo instead. My friends stuck with their steaks, one ordered the Cola steak and not sure what my other friend ordered.   We were all given a tomato based soup to start off with. My friend said that it usually tasted better, and was kind of bland today. I tried it, and it did taste a bit watered down, I added some salt and pepper to it but didn't care for it much.   My friends ordered guacamole, which was made table side. One guacamole was used along with probably half of a tomato... was it worth the $8? Not so sure, but it WAS good.  The steaks and my combo came with rice and beans, my friends' steaks were supposed to come with tortillas but they didn't and by the time the server checked up on us, they didn't want them anymore. The beef enchilada was filling, lots of shredded beef and it wasn't too salty! I was too full to try my tamale but did get a bite of my friends' steaks. Both were very soft, and well seasoned. I didn't like the cola steak because it reminded me of a cola flavored bbq sauce that was overly sweet.   Unfortunately since we filled up on chips, we only had a couple bites of our food and asked for the rest to be boxed up. Our server wasn't around much, but the busboy was amazing and very attentive. He boxed up our food, tableside and was the person refilling our chips and waters.   Our server came by, asked us if we wanted dessert and we said no, just the check. Then, he left somewhere, and a few minutes later came back to ask us if we wanted dessert again.   It was a 25 minute drive from my place, but I wanted to come here because my friends raved about it. After my initial experience, I don't think I'll be coming back here anytime soon and will just stick to someplace closer to me.",

It was absolutely delicious!!! I love their sopa Fideo that they serve before your entree, it's like a little bowl of Mexican noodle soup, I cheat and crunch up some of my chips they give you with the bean dip, I love this place. The service is excellent, the food is delicious and I wish I lived closer. I rate this place 10 stars!!!!!!!",

It's kinda small but they seem to move pretty quickly so if you do wait, it shouldn't be long.  The food here is excellent! If you're a fan of guacamole, make sure you try the fresh guac here. A waiter will come out with fresh avocados, all the fixings and make it exactly how you want...so good! Their chips are homemade and they also have a really good fideo soup. I ordered shrimp ceviche for my dinner which was alright but definitely not the best I've had. My wife had chicken fajitas which was great and I would definitely recommend it.   Aside from the food, this restaurant has some of the best service I've ever gotten. The staff is friendly and ridiculously fast at getting what you need. My drink never came close to being empty. Their menu is also pretty big so there's something for everyone here. I'd come back, even if just for the great service and killer fresh guacamole!",

We ordered the mango margaritas. I appreciate the salt on the rim but they skipped the salt I guess. I ordered the chile colorado. It was impressive. We also ordered fried ice cream and it was devious. The place is very busy as it is popular. I also liked the dress of the workers and also the tortilla lady making fresh tortillas!

The decor is awesome I couldnt stop looking around at all the cool shit they have on the walls. but it didnt seem that tacky.   The Bad: Nothing was really bad here. the Hostess was a little bland but Ive come to accept that from the valley and the food wasnt that great and it def isnt that cheap. I still dont understand how they do their pricing.    The Ugly: I would say the only ugly thing is the location.

While in North Vegas I searched for good Mexican food and saw the amount of reviews in the amount of stars at this restaurant had received. I can honestly tell you that it may have been low in regards to star quantity! This Mexican restaurant was absolutely amazing and the staff is great but I think the most impressive part of this restaurant is how clean it was. If you ever find yourself near this restaurant you owe it to yourself, considering the prices, to come in and experience it for yourself!",

Not really worth it for the price though ..theres many mexican restaurants that are in vegas that are way better then this spot and about same price if not cheaper ... In that being said i dont think the food is horrible ...i just think it doesnt match up with the bill ... Personally i defently rather hit up another spot with more bang for its buck in taste .. Lil bit on the salty side ... But like i said food isnt bad its just ok ...",

This is the way my grandmother would have cooked...if she wasn't Norwegian and from MN.  Service was great after a short wait for a table.  We sat by the tortilla station, pressed fresh and tossed on the flat top.  A fresh tortilla is the only way to really enjoy Mexican food.  The food came out quick, very authentic and very nice spice.  I had a pork dish with flour tortillas and they were so soft and fluffy I could have eaten them all day.  The pork was wonderful, perfectly cooked with a nice heat but not overpowering.  Bean were good as was the rice yet I left them alone do to the tortillas, didnt want to crowd them from the meal.  Well worth the visit and the wait and I will be back.",

    "text": "This is amazing Mexican cuisine. My family and I have been coming here for years, way before Yelp, and since we live across town from this restaurant, we literally have to go out of our way to come here. But it's worth it! (usually)  They have an extensive lunch menu with 30+ items at reasonable lunch prices. The service is top notch usually and they use hand-made tortillas (that you can watch being made) which are worth the drive, I mean they are delicious!   The food and most service here is great. Just watch the portions and how much you are charged. For example, this time I got the chicken fajitas which, according to the menu, comes with tortillas, guacamole and sour cream. It's a sizzling skillet and a decent portion of meat and veggies, but I had less than a teaspoon of guacamole and a tablespoon of sour cream on my plate with the rice/beans. So I asked the first person who came back to our table to look at the tiny amount/portion and to bring me a little more guacamole. He brought me a small dish with guacamole and sour cream (which was then properly proportioned for the amount of fajitas). Unfortunately when the check came I had been charged $4.95 for the guac and $1.95 for the sour cream! I explained it to my server who apologized and said he didn't see the plate and couldn't do anything about it. Truthfully it wasn't his fault because he didn't bring it out, the runner did, and whoever I asked for a little bit more is the one that dropped the ball and charged me. I didn't get a chance to speak to the manager because I was in a hurry to get to an appointment. I really don't appreciate being charged for something that was supposedly included, but just wasn't properly apportioned for the meal.   I also saw that they have an attractive happy hour which I'm tempted to try with 2 for 1 margaritas and draft beers, but I'm apprehensive about going because of this experience. This would have been a 5 star review if it weren't for that. Honestly, I'm pleased with everything else.",

It took her 10 minutes to get over to us and she didn't even understand the English I was speaking. Very disappointing for this restaurant. I do not recommend coming here.

We ordered guacamole, which they made table side and customized to our liking. We each ordered entrees- fish tacos for me, and hubby had chicken and shrimp enchiladas.

    "text": "We usually always end up at Lindo Michoacan by Las Lomas in Henderson but we wanted to try somewhere else. I've always passed by Viva Zapatas and I told my husband we should try it out. Well...here it goes.  There was a 15-20 minute wait (which I don't mind because it was a Mother's day Weekend). I pictured the restaurant waaaay bigger but I was wrong. The entrance is so small that if you do have to wait just know that you're gonna be waiting outside in the heat.   The table that they gave us was near the entrance. I wanted to switch tables BUT I knew that was gonna be another 20 minute wait and we were already starving. Anyways, it was pretty dark inside. Felt like we were some dam vampires.  Now to the food....so....if I would of known that they pretty much did the exactly same thing as Lindo Michoacan, I would of just gone to Lindo Michoacan. The chips and dips are pretty much the same. Oh and let's not forget the fideo. Which by the way had no taste at all AND pretty much there was no fideos in my dam soup! Huh!? Felt like I was drinking colored water. But I will give them this...I ordered a combo of chile rellenos without the sauce. That was some good ass Chile rellenos. The beans were pretty good and the rice was ehh...but I wasn't super impressed.   The service was okay....  I wouldn't come back.  P.S. I was gonna give them two stars BUT the chile rellenos saved them.",

We were seated quickly and the waiter appeared almost immediately. Drinks came out quickly and the waiter waited until we had decided on dinner before approaching us for our order, a refreshing change from the usual hovering around and rushed feeling. The meal was outstanding, just enough spice heat to enhance the flavor not overpower it. Some might want  more heat, but for me this was just right. The table was cleared AFTER we finished each course by very attentive wait assistants, nice touch to wait, not hover. Overall service was great and food was outstanding,  Only have one downside, the lighting is dim and makes reading the menu challenging. The print on some parts of the menu is the same color as the lighting, so there is no contrast. Those of us who have a little trouble seeing in dim light might want to bring a small light. I would still  highly recommend VIVA ZAPATAS.",

While waiting for our food, we nibbled on what seemed like endless tortilla chips, salsa, and bean dip. They had a musician play live music and that definitely lent to a more relaxed atmosphere. Food was very good and we were thankful that we didn't order an appetizer because the portions are fairly large although the table side guacamole was tempting (next time!).

The hostess took the drink orders and the waitress brought the drinks and a busser brought chips, salsa, and bean dip. Awesome teamwork! Everyone's timing was on point.  Allow me to point out: if you're craving chips and salsa, you can go to pretty much any old Mexican restaurant and get your fix. Viva Zapata's offers chips, salsa, bean dip, AND a fabulous fideo soup (it's basically tomato soup with short noodles; VZ's take on it is among the best I've had). Speaking of the soup, the busser brought out a cup of it for the toddler before our orders were even taken, which kept her busy and gave us time to look over the menu.  He had huevos rancheros and I had camarones deseados(?). Huevos rancheros came with pork (a little dry, but great flavor). Shrimp was incredible. Something different about their rice--I can't quite put my finger on it, but it's definitely a good thing.",

Las Vegans usually place Lindo Michoacan at the top of the heap when it comes to Mexican dining, but my erudite palate says Zapata's is easily just as as good, and much more affordable.  I really cannot say enough good things about this cozy little joint.  It's as authentic as it gets, and the food here is so good I don't have a go-to plate.  I always spend a good deal of time browsing the generous menu to pick something new, and it has always been delicious.  The chips and salsa are homemade, and probably laced with something illegal because it's hard to put them down.  The complementary fideo soup with an entree is a really nice touch and quite delicious.  There's a lot of complex flavors going on in what usually is just noodles and broth.  As far as the entrees go, I've never had anything that wasn't just firing on all cylinders.  Most recently I had the Camarones Borrachos entree, which was shrimp cooked in tequila, and it was absolutely delicious.  Before that I had one of the carnitas dishes and it gave me a glorious food comma.  The margaritas are also some of the best around.  My only criticism of Zapata's is the parking situation.  It's a small, crowded lot and we often have to park at the gas station next to it, but it's a minor inconvenience compared to the quality of the food awaiting inside.  Highly, highly recommended.",

When you walk into this restaurant you feel like your in Mexico. It looks like an old Mexican tavern. Dim lighting with a guy in the corner with a guitar jamming away. Honestly the vibes of this place was awesome! The bar was more than fully stocked. With your \"American vodka's\" and a WIDE WIDE selection of Tequila's.   Service: 3/5 The service felt very homey, like I had a Mexican mother cooking me home made Mexican food. The food was very wholesome in HUGE portions. I literally had no Idea where to begin. So I started in the middle and ate my way out. LOL Service at the bar could've been a bit better. I went during peak dinner hours so I guess that's why they neglected us. I noticed my group didn't get any bar tables stands for our plates like other groups so we ate directly on the bar.  Also our complimentary salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip ran low. I wasn't sure If I could as for more because it was complimentary \"well so I thought it was\"   Food: 4/5 First the salsa, chips, and pinto bean dip. OMG was super delicious. The salsa was average but the bean dip was very tasty. but don't fill up on the chips. Next comes the pre dinner soup, not sure what it was but it was very bland. It looked spicy but it wasn't. Now the meal, it was very heavy, when I say heavy. I mean fatty, cheesy, and oily. I literally had to push around the cheese to get to anything. It was EVERYWHERE kind of an over load. The cheese enchilada lacked flavor, and on my 3 combo plate (1 tostada, 1 beef taco, 1 enchilada). The beef on the taco was shredded like pulled pork. It seemed more like a carnita. The tostada was very fresh because it was topped off with a big glob of guacamole. YUMMMM   Drinks: 4/5 The drinks were just right. Not too strong, not too weak. A perfect blend. I ordered a margarita because I felt.. I needed to indulge fully into Mexican culture. It was a perfect combo to my meal.   Pricing: 3/5 My order was $13.95 a bit pricy for the Area of town it's in. But It was understandable because the food was good. The atmosphere complimented the food well. Plus it came with complimentary salsa and chips, with also this intro dinner soup.  Suggestions/Advice:  - Don't go during peak dinner hours if you want impeccable service. - Don't fill up on a lot of chips,salsa, and pinto bean dip. - Portions are huge  - TRY THE PINTO BEAN DIP it was heaven!!! - Parking might be difficult its a very small limited area.",

Two families, of 4 mind you,  sat down after us  and were done eating and paid their bill and yet we were still waiting on our food!  Finally when we decided to get up and leave that's when we were asked and told our food would be coming out shortly! Seriously that is what it takes for someone to show courtesy and tend to you!  Oh and get this I walk back to get managers card and name, I'm standing there hearing them talk and the man has the balls to state he had informed us our food was already coming, I CORRECTED HIM, YES YOU TOLD US OUR FOOD WAS COMING WHEN WE GOT UP TO LEAVE!

Since its Halloween, the decor was based on their dia de muerte festival.   Service: Service was wonderful, the waiters knew the food well and gave me good recommendations based on the preferred protein that I wanted. The waiter was attentive to our needs.  Food: Food was great, the complimentary nachos with the salsa and refried beans were really good. Expect to keep on munching on the nachos while waiting for the entrees. The salsa had a good roasted tomato taste with spice that keeps you eating the nachos! The entree that I had was grilled chicken and it tasted great. Plus the freshly made flour tortillas made the dining experience better.  Overall: I would definitely come back to try the other entrees, dining experience is great and the quality of the food is very good , the nachos is a definite bonus. Next time I want to try this restaurant for dinner with the family this time.",

I came with a party of three including I for a brunch breakfast meal, our server was a little tone deaf or hard at hearing maybe a combination of the two. When our orders were brought to the table we had items missing some that were requested and some that were supposed to be included with the meal or so the menu says but after my argument with my server he assured me I was wrong. The food itself was ok I did like it but my rice tasted a little dry how can something be wet and have a dry taste to it was it microwaved?",

Within minutes there were two huge margaritas on the rocks with extra salt in front of me and an encyclopedic menu of house specialties in my hands! So far so good!   The guacamole, house salsa and chips were great. The all inclusive sampler appetizer was more then three people could go through and the portion sizes were borderline gluttonous...everything was perfect. I had the Pollo Sarandeado Estilo \"Rebelion\". It was spicy enough to order another margarita but flavorful and not over the top with heat.   The service and ambiance was wonderful. The waitstaff was prompt and on their best game and the drinks and food kept coming throughout the night. There were also decommissioned rifles and other weapons all over the walls and seeing how I was there to attend a military course, I felt right at home. I'll definitely come here again!",

I have been coming here for years and I have to APOLOGIZE, I haven't mention this eatery until now. The staff here has always been friendly and bring you chips and two stone bowls with salsa as soon as you're seated.  One is a warm bean dip which is creamy and warm and the other is a finely ground tomato based salsa.  Viva Zapatas do have healthier dishes on their menu, but they are not \"flagged\" as such.  My favorite dish here is named after the owner's Grandmother, so you know it has to be good and it's on the healthy side.  It is called, Pollo Estilo \"Abuelita Magdalena\", which is two Grilled Chicken breast simmered in olive oil, fresh lime juice, garlic, oregano and yellow peppers.  The chicken is flavorful and kept moist from the cooking process.  The plate is also shared with rice, guacamole and beans.  Every time we have to go to Nellis Air Force base/North Las Vegas, we always stop by Zapatas for a meal (my wife says the Margarita's are good, too)!",

The wait at 12:30pm was 30 minutes so we decided to eat in the bar as you can order from the FULL menu when seated there. We ordered a Taco Salad with Shredded Beef to share. I was surprised to find the meal lacking in flavor... the beef, though fairly moist, had almost no depth of flavor.  Also, I had expected there to be some beans included with the meat (hubby didn't) and there were none. Salad-wise the lettuce was fresh and crisp. There were NO other veggies - I would have liked some onions, radish, purple cabbage and substantially more Pico de Gallo than the SPRINKLING that was included. Though there was a small scoop each of guacamole and sour cream the salad needed either an option of dressing OR substantially MORE Pico, guac., and/or sour cream. Service at the bar was spot-on!   For these reasons we feel that the best rating we can give is 3 out of 5 stars. We hope that Viva Zapata's improves their food quality so that we can stop in the next time we travel to North Vegas to go to the VA Hospital and Clinics.",

    "text": "Other yelpers will disagree, but I think this is the best Mexican restaurant in town. The food, decor, and service are all top notch.  I love the little things about this restaurant. Guacamole is made table side, tortillas are crispy yet chewy, chicken breasts are butterflied, and the salsa is spicy without being overwhelming. Everything adds up to create an enjoyable dining experience.  Of particular note is the mole. It is smooth, rich, complex, and somewhat spicy. The mole is so layered that it is impossible to discern all of the ingredients. However, they blend and play with each other to create something that is close to magic.  For a nice low calorie treat that's sure to delight your Vegan friends, try the Quesa Fundido con Rajas. Ok, so it's not low calorie. But you really should try it at least once a year. The hot cheese wrapped in chewy tortillas is beyond words.  One of my favorite parts about Zapatas is that it is a community restaurant. I always see people in uniform here, whether they are from the police department or Nellis. People meet here after work, come here on dates, and bring their families. We always bring our out of town guests here.   I can't say enough good things about this restaurant.",

She sat us down and not to long after we had our waiter take our drinks. They handed us chips and salsa right away. We placed our order and munched on the chips and salsa which was pretty yummy.  But the wait just to get our food was pretty lengthy. We ended up getting full off of the food because of the wait. So when our food finally came it was nice and hot.  I ordered the steak enchilada mole. One bite and it was so overly stuffed with cheese.  Almost to the point where it made me sick. I could bearly taste the mole.  I Know that I will never ordered this again. I also had the Carne asada salad. It was overpowered with lime. It had no flavor. Another thing I will not order again.  My son had the steak cognac.  I took a bite and it was good they cooked it med rare perfect. My husband had the shrimp and it was cooked just right also and there was good flavor.  If it was based off service alone I would put another star.  Maybe I'll come back and try a different item but so far I was not impressed with my food.",

The pork is tender (not fatty), and is covered in a sauce that will make you slap your momma. Oh, did I mention there is a lady in the back making homemade tortillas? Please remember to tip this nice lady -- she is working hard back there.

We were pleased right off the bat with the warm tortilla chips, hot bean dip, and salsa as soon as we sat down.  We're suckers for tableside guacamole, which was great as well.  The portions were huge - we only needed two entrees to feed me, my wife, and our two kids.  We got the fish tacos and the combination with a chili relleno and green chile pork burrito.  My only criticism of the food is that the peppers they used for the relleno were VERY mild and I like them to have a bit more punch.  The kids enjoyed the live mariachi and had fun watching them make the tortillas fresh behind a window in the corner of the restaurant.  All in all a pleasant meal and we were back on the freeway quickly.",

    "text": "Right off the Craig Rd. exit on the 15 North is a great little Mexican restaurant called Viva Zapatas. It's a relatively small spot that you would probably miss if you weren't looking for it. The food is excellent, but the parking is tight. Zapatas makes for a great lunch spot or a great dinner place to wow your out of town guests. The restaurant has a cozy atmosphere and features a cool bar in the center of the restaurant with a couple of over head tv screens so you won't miss the big game. You can find a picture or two of Emilliano Zapata hanging on the walls along with a few other eclectic Mexican artifacts. The food is excellent! They start you off with chips, salsa, and beans. This place reminds me of a great Mexican restaurant that is no more called Sal's Mexican Inn in Oxnard,Ca. Go with a combination plate, no need for an appetizer because the portions are good. I like the #4 combo which is a pork burrito, chicken enchilada, chicken taco, and rice and beans. I like to substitute the chicken taco for a chorizo taco. I'm not sure if the chorizo taco is even on the menu, but don't leave without one. They are excellent. The pork burrito is so tasty and the chicken enchilada pops off your plate and into your mouth. The enchilada is smothered in cheese just how I like it. Be sure to order the guacamole and watch them come over to your table and make it fresh in front of your eyes. The guacamole is first class. Zapatas also has a killer chile relleno. On the way out don't leave without what I call the best after dinner mints in town-undisputed. These little green babies aren't so minty, but more lemon limey. They will leave a refreshing taste in your mouth for the ride home. The bottom line is no matter what you order at Viva Zapatas you won't be disappointed, so if you're in Northtown you have to drop by.",

We were greeted by a friendly host and sat in a booth as requested. It wasn't too busy so I expected things to go smoothly, but I was wrong. Server came to get our drink order and they came fast but from there on everything went down hill. We ordered guacamole and it took about 15 mins before the server came and made it table side. After that we put in our entree order and that took about 40 minutes. By the time our food came we were full from the chips, guac, salsa, and beans but we still managed to share my chicken sopitos (they were soooooo good). Unfortunately because the food took so long we weren't able to eat our torta. I asked for the manager because we were unhappy with how our experience had gone so far. He apologized but it didn't seem sincere, he was actually making excuses of why it took so long(a torta does NOT take 40 minutes to make). I mean, I've worked in the restaurant industry and if someone's food ever took long I would apologize and find a way to make it better(no we weren't fishing for free food, we paid for what we consumed). All in all the food was good but it took way too long, not sure I'll be back.",

Love the decor, the Tia Maria making the hand made tortillas in the back, the music, the staff is wonderful.   I love absolutely everything on their menu. I've tried almost everything. Green Chilaquiles, Carne Asada, Fideo Soup, yummmm....Everything is good.  I hate that to come here I have to drive 45 + minutes from Henderson. :-( If ever in the North side of town and in the mood for some good, authentic Mexican, try this place.  UPDATE REVIEW:   After coming back a few times after writing my last review, I can't help to notice how much the quality of the food has gone down.   As a faithful customer of this place, I can say it is NOT what it used to be. They are so busy, service is terrible. The food now lacks authenticity. Tastes like they cook everything on the same pan.   Sad to see this place slowly start to slack and lose something so good...because they had it for a while. Hope things improve. I will not come back soon and spend $17 on a mediocre dish.  Step it up, Viva. Lindo Michoacan is starting to sound better than your place. :-/",

Servers are quick to bring refills on chips, salsa, or drinks. My first time here was at dinner time and aside from the lighting not being that great, everything else was perfect. I felt just like family and welcomed by everyone working there. Being from CA, I have had many different types of Mexican food from numerous places. This place is definitely a go to when I'm craving Mexican food.  Only downfall in my opinion, which is why I did not give them 5 stars, is because of their parking lot situation. Very few spots to park in. Luckily my first time here it wasn't too busy. But the second time I came here, there were no spots and nearly had to battle someone else for an open spot when someone left.  Definitely will be back again.",

One thing I always find that's a hallmark of a great restaurant is great service from being greeted at the door to when you sit down and how you're attended during your meal and Viva Zapata was all those things and attentive to my drink, chips, salsa, and bean dip.  I just want to mention that bean dip with chips is something few places offer but always wins me over in a Mexican restaurant.   I ordered the Torta de Pierna which is a pork sandwich that came out with some time that shows it wasn't just heated up and made with care.  The bread was perfectly toasted and the meat was tender, juicy, and flavorful.   I didn't feel a hot plate nor was warned about one and that's something that always makes me feel great before a bite.    I'm looking forward to future visits and trying more plates from this place due to the food, service, and overall atmosphere.",

Authentic mexican food, with tons of flavor!  The service is superb.  Chips and salsa are on point.  They also bring you bean dip and fideo as a starter. Order the guacamole, they make it table side from scratch.  Real avocados, jalapenos, lime, garlic, cilantro, etc.  It is soo tasty.  I have been for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Everything I have eaten from seafood to machaca has been great.  I will go there everytime I visit Las Vegas. You should try this place as a good alternative away from the strip and alot more economical.  P.S.  Homemade tortillas!!  That's reason enough to visit this place!",

The service is top notch, the food is great, and the live music gives it a flare of excitement and authenticity.  A friend of mine introduced me to this restaurant a while back and ever since then I have been huge fan. They serve things you do not get at chain restaurants like their own specialty noodle soup, which is especially good during the winter season, refried beans as a chip dip, and a array of dishes that are mouth watering.   The inside is very small and it is more of a locals restaurant than a tourist place which means that it is cheaper cost wise and you get better service. Granted you might get put in a odd spot to eat but I have found that every sitting area offers something different to look at. I love to bring my out of town guest and friends here to eat because it offers such a large variety of food items to chose from and because they always leave satisfied.",

The extensive menu was creative and the Shrimp stuffed peppers were out of this world. Very authentic decor for a Mexican restaurant named Viva Zapata. We highly recommend this restaurant. We will come again when we are back in North Las Vegas.",

My wife heard of all the \"good\" reviews and wanted to go, I tried to warn her but I guess my word wasn't good enough. Well enough said since she's the wife we ended up going. I didn't even order anything at this place the second time around. She did she got some chicken plate ended up with diarrhea and ended up telling me she should have listened to me because her stomach was all bubbly and stuff. So if you do you come to this place eat at your own risk. YOU'VE BEEN WARNED!!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

    "text": "This place specializes in old, tired, uninspired dishes that maybe, were once relevant 25 years ago when Vegas was still a desert town with 10 Mexican restaurants to speak of and a chicken enchilada was a big deal.  But today, tasteless piles of slop that look like they were put together at an all-you-can-eat buffet is just not going to cut it. Fish and chicken that was previously frozen tastes like it. Dry, chewy and tasteless. These guys wrote the book on how to serve frozen blocks of flesh weeks later: \"No worries,  just bury it under a ton of sauce and melted cheese. Those idiot gringos won't notice.\"  Another specialty of this place is the unbearably irritating wait staff that constantly interrupt every 2 minutes to refill our water glass after each sip, remove a plate the second I take my last bite, or asking us what we want to eat 30 seconds after sitting down and being handed a 5 page menu. GO AWAY goddamit!! and let your guests breathe!   The place looks old and shabby. The margarita mix is that sickly-sweet fake lime powder. Nothing good here. These guys need to shut down, retool and modernize.",

Tonight I ordered two simple dinners, chicken enchiladas and a shrimp tacos dinner. Both were not prepared properly. 1st, we placed a to go order by phone. To management- if you're going to have someone taking phone orders please make sure they can understand and speak English. We arrived at the restaurant, waited 20 mins and only received a half order of shrimp tacos. We had to wait for them to prepare our 2 shrimp tacos correctly. 2nd, we get home to find they only prepared 1 chicken enchilada...wow then to top it off the food was cold...damn Viva you suck lately. Maybe you can't handle success",

Maybe they were having an off day, but first impressions counts in my book!! The service was awesome though... from the hostess, server, to manager and the busser I give them 4 stars. Thank you!!

They make the guacamole in person at your table . Fresh tortillas. Be careful of the chips and salsa you will be full before your food arrives lol . The salsa is very blah in my opinion tastes funny. Most dishes here can be pricey within the $12.00 -$25.00 range. But they do have a lunch special menu with is worth catching.  Bar is located in the middle of the restaurant which you can also eat at. Parking lot is small and can be a pain to find parking if busy. The lighting is bad inside which is a missed opportunity for good pictures and food pictures.  Located near just off Craig and I-15 if your ever in the area and want some very good Hispanic food I do recommend. Go go go!",

Requested a green sauce instead, which never came.   Someone in the group ordered chilaquiles which were very tasty.

The down side was the taste of the salsa that came complimentary with chips & some refried beans. The salsa had a very strange taste but since it was free we didn't see any reason to complain. My wife had the Shrimp enchiladas & they tasted great, I had the Lengua Revolution & it was friggin awesome. Lengua can either be really good or really bad. At Zappata it was wonderful, so tender you could have. Lien on it to cut it. Overall a wonderful dinner & atmosphere.",

I Also added a tostada it also was plentiful and the Pico de Gallo was the bomb.  The only reason that I'm not giving 5 stars is the service was a little bit slow even though we were doing dinner a little early and well outside their busy time.   I would recommend and return.",

The small innocuous restaurant serves up some incredible food with friendly fast and efficient service.  It seems like everything is made in house including the corn and flour tortillas. To start with you going to get chips with refried beans and a nice medium - hot salsa. The challenge is they are so good not to fill up on them prior to your meal arriving.  The meals come with a bowl of soup which consists of a nice consomme with micro noodles. Very flavorful and enjoyable. While they have the typical Mexican dishes on the menu, there are many things that I'm sure you've never tried before but need exploration. We had the fish  fillet stuffed with octopus and shrimp which was incredible. We also had the pork chili Verde pork was quite tender and flavorful and nice fresh chili verde sauce. The flavor quite complex and very enjoyable.  The servers are friendly, knowledgeable, and seem to really enjoy being there. They had live music consisting of a guitar player who also saying and it helped create a great atmosphere.  Don't be concerned about the number of stars on yelp as the reviews for real. This place is really that good.",

Anyways, off track, here we go with the review! The restaurant is located on the north side of town going towards the Speedway just off of I15 on East Craig located next to a gas station. It is 1 block off I15. For you folks in Las Vegas or Henderson, this Mexican restaurant is well worth the drive north.  I had lunch with some co-workers after volunteering at Three Square (I highly recommend if you like to volunteer and give back to the community). There was a bit of a wait since it was about lunchtime on a Tuesday. Plus, we had to park on the other side of the gas station. Parking spaces are very limited next to tis restaurant.  I love the ambience inside the restaurant. High ceilings and vintage decor. Cool and comfortable as well.  The food was great. I had one of the lunch specials. I had the cheese enchilada with a beef taco. It came with rice and beans. While we waited for the meals to come out, we enjoyed chips with salsa and bean dip. Good Stuff! Their regular size margarita was cool and refreshing. Glad I had the regular size, it was big as it was. I can't imagine the larger size.  So get your sombrero on and Vamonoso to Viva Zapatas soon!",

Chips, drinks, sauces were refilled without havering to flag anyone down. Host was knowledgeable about the menu since there was a large selection of authentic food.

A lot of places have become cheap with their chips, bread, whatever it may be that is usually free.  But not Viva Zapata's.    The Chile Relenos are excellent.  Definitely my go to place for Mexican food.    I dare you to eat your entire plate of food too.  It's enough food for today and tomorrow.

Viva Zapatas has definitely hit that note straight on! The food is based off of traditional cuisine from the state of Morelos in Mexico. So it does tend to be heartier, earthier foods since Morelos is landlocked, and not as much of the seafood stuff. But they do offer a variety of shrimp dishes, and a couple of fish ones.  The ambiance is very unique. Tons of old \"ranchero\" artifacts adorn the wall. Colorful picados hang in the halls. And of course lets not forget the man himself Emiliano Zapata (for whom the restaurant is named) in a vintage frame!  Now - to the food. Before you plan your visit for dinner - starve yourself for most of the day! (or be prepared for lots of leftovers)!! :D Haven't been there for lunch service but just might have to one of these days.  Once you are seated, you immediately are brought tortilla chips, refried beans, and salsa (red). Now, I will warn you - don't finish the tortillas off! (they bring you more, it's the neverending pit of chips!) So unless you want to fill up on chips and dip, back off them! (I prefer to add a splash of lime to mine, so they definitely accommodate). You are also brought an appetizer soup - I don't know what it is. But the best way I can think of it - chicken noodle meets tortilla soup!  Last time I had eaten here, I had the mole served up with beans and rice - and it was superb! Portion was HUGE so everyone in the group had doggie bags heading home.  This time round I wanted to do something a little different - so I went for the 'Pollo con napoles\" (Chicken with Prickly Pear Cactus). VERY deeeeeelicious! Had just the right touch of heat, and seasoned beautifully with the cilantro and other veggies. ($14 entree) Now here is the part that had me craving the \"tortillarias\" that I used to see on the streets of mexico - fresh, homemade, tortillas! And when I say fresh - I mean they have a gal working her tail end off mixing the dough up portioning it out, and cooking it all up on a traditional griddle. So if you have a small enough party and want to entertain your little one, ask for the table close to the tortilla zone so the little one can watch the tortilla making process! And yes they offer you the choice, corn or flour for your tortilla.  I can't remember what the other members had in our party, one had the combo 2, another had the fajitas i think. But all I can remember is hearing everyone going - \"wow, this is REALLY good food!\" And yes we brought home all the leftovers! Had them for our lunch today, and both hubby and I still have more leftovers for lunch tomorrow! So yeah $14 entree spllt into 3 meals! :)   I know this is a longwinded review - but have to just really lay it all out on the line for you! Almost done - just got the service to go over, and you'll be done.  Service: impeccable! Everyone from the entrance to the bus boys are extremely professional and EXTREMELY polite! They do everything they can to ensure you are satisfied with your meal, and are very quick to refill your glass (or ask about it) if they it is going on empty.  Still want more?   Well, stop reading and go drive there and discover this place! :)",

That didn't happen in fact it looked like they forgot about us. I even inquired about our placement and they ensured they didn't forget. Plus they said oh we will get you guys menus and they never did. of course I attempted to ask but couldn't get anyone's attention so we left. Do yourself a favor and go to some other Mexican restaurant if you want to eat and be served properly.",

My co-worker drank about 6 horchatas being that as soon as she was done with one, the server would immediately grab another (Now that's service)!",

    "text": "I am gonna be as honest as i can reviewing this restaurant. It appears that I am the only one in the party of 15 we had that didn't really like this place. We came here on the recommendation of my father in law, who figured we'd all need menudo to cure our hangovers this past Saturday morning. Maybe it was because I wanted a good ol' fashioned American breakfast or maybe because I have certain restaurants back home, but this place just didn't do it for me. With that being said, this is what I found:  LOCATION & DECOR  It was beautiful both inside and out. Bar area took up most of the restaurant. Major selection of tequilas. Seating for big parties wasn't the best and we must have taken up about 1/4 of the restaurant. Location is good for those visiting or stationed at Nellis Air Force Base, but bad for people staying on or near the strip, as it is a good 15 minutes from the Dowtown Las Vegas, 20 from the strip.  SERVICE:  Seating- We were seated right away, rare for such a big party, but we were there around breakfast time, so beat the rush.  Wating- Our server took the drink order right away, brought them out right away and the beers were ice cold, as well as the mugs we asked for, and the margarita drinkers in the party said that they were poured generously. This is where my low stars come into play. IT TOOK TWO HOURS FROM ARRIVAL TO DEPARTURE! We must have waited a good 45 minutes before all the dishes began to come out. We were brought out salsa, which was OUTSTANDING, refried beans w/ cheese, also pretty good exept for the big glop of cheese in the middle, and those kept coming out, but by the time the food had arrived, I was full!  FOOD:  I didn't like my machaca. I had the pork after being given the option of pork or beef. I should have went with my gut and gotten the beef. It was okay, but not a dish that said, \"WOW\". Although, I have to give credit to the waiter because when I asked him what was better between the machaca and the chilaquiles, he said go with the machaca, and even though it didn't wow me, he was able to recommend something to me, which alot of waiters can't or won't do. Now If I would have only asked him if the pork or beef were better, I might have enjoyed my meal more.  Some in my party ordered campechanas (seafood cocktails) and they were pretty much licking the sides afterwards, so they all seemed to enjoy it. My wife had a grilled chicken breast in a garlic sauce, and it was pretty tasty. A good friend ordered the Pipian, and she said it was some of the best she's ever tasted that isn't her mama's.  Overall, I think this place would be good for drinks and watching a game, as they had the Charger game on that day. It might even be good for a smaller group then ours, say 2-4 people, maybe no more than 6. Two hours is a long time to be in a restaurant, especially when most of that time is spent waiting on food to come out, and maybe it could have been because our group is so large, but I've had faster service in other restaurants with a group just as big. I might give it another shot one day, but not anytime soon!",

I was only drinking an Arnold Palmer since I had to drive but I was not rushed from the bar and that was much appreciated.  There was also a great singer with his guitar (not too loud and complementary to the atmosphere).  There seemed to be many happy hour specials on drinks and I hope to partake on my next visit into town.",

The avocado appetizer is the best I've ever had at any mexican restaurant. Part of the reason its so good is the experience; they actually make the appetizer in front of you! Another good feature of this place is the live music. Theres an amazing guitar player/singer who sings a lot of classical mexican tunes. The reason I gave this a 4 out of 5 is due to the small and inconvenient parking lot, especially since they're usually always busy. Second, the last time we went there we were COMPLETELY ignored. We had to find the manager twice in order get our food ordered and delivered. 30 minute wait is unacceptable, especially when no one checks on you. That is what cost them a perfect score. Other than that, a very good meal awaits for you here.",

The service here is always top notch, and since I work close by and have been here more times than I can count, it is a lot to say that the service has never let us down.  The food is top quality for Mexican food, from the shredded beef tacos to the enchiladas.  Nothing is ever served too salty or greasy, just perfect.  The lunch dishes come with a free drink, which is a great deal too!    My favorite dish has to be 16 on the lunch menu.  I can't remember the name, but it is basically a couple of slices of juicy chicken breasts topped with a creamy sauce, with beans and rice on the side.  with this special, you get your choice of homemade corn or flour tortillas (I prefer the flour, but they are both good).  And if you look at the southwest corner of the restaurant, you can see your fresh tortillas being prepared right on the spot!    Zapatas is a favorite in our community, and in Las Vegas in general.  I know people that come from across town to eat here.  It really is a top notch, affordable restaurant!",

    "text": "Husband and I were looking for a fiesta of flavors- this place was decent, however for the price it was a bit of a let down. The opening snacks of chips and salsa and refried beans were amazing and very addictive. Salsa had good flavor and spice. Then came the complimentary soup that comes with every entree. This was pretty good as well- at most places it has an overly tomato taste, but it was more subdued here which I like. But nothing to run home and rave about- at the end of the day it's just a little broth with some noodles. Now to the main course: Tacos de pescado- The fish was breaded and fried served in a flour tortilla. Just because something is fried doesn't mean it has to completely lack flavor. There was absolutely zero seasoning. I had to drench the tacos in the sauce that came on the side in order to get any flavor, and then all I ended up tasting in the end was the sauce. Beef Fajitas- again the meat completely lacked flavor. We were looking for spice or something and just got overdone chewy pieces of steak. For a $17 entree we were very disappointed. And the meat to pepper ratio was horrible. There was barely enough meat to make two tacos and the plate was piled high with so much filler- onions and bell peppers.  Overall- these two dishes weren't home runs, but I can see that this place has the potential to produce delicious dishes however I probably will not be returning to find out.",

One out of three on the main course is not good but the chile relleno was good enough I would go back for that alone. The service was great in the bar area and the beer was cold. I ate at three Mexican restaurants while in Vegas and this was the best. The other two had dry pork as well on their tacos so maybe that is the way they like it in Vegas?!?",

We got the chips and three dips which were more delicious than my own meal. Ordered and got the horchata and it was made perfectly. Very authentic feel but kind of dimly lit even at lunch time. I got the taco bowl and my sister ordered a burrito. Waited a little over 35 minutes for our two entrees to come out which was kind of a long wait but we had chips so we were ok. The food was good, but I'd still prefer Chipotle. There was a birthday celebration and they sang happy birthday and brought all the servers out complete with instruments, it was fun to watch. I noticed there were many Mexicans there for their lunch, even a few construction workers and a good amount of older folks at the bar. Sadly our food took so long we had no time for dessert but overall the service was great, food was good and the wait time not the best. I recommend going at a time when it isn't busy.",

    "text": "OMG I LOVE THIS PLACE!! I end up eating here at least 3 or 4 times a month...if not for lunch then for dinner. This is authentic Mexican (made by real Mexicans - I'm just sayin). They have homemade tortillas which are delicious!! They always bring out fresh chips with salsa and bean dip and I suggest getting the guacamole as an appetizer. They make it tableside and you can choose how hot you want it (amount of jalapenos) as you can choose the amount of onions, tomatoes, and cilantro.  For lunch they have your typical \"Order by Number\" chart. I generally order the numero siete (that would be 7). It's a cheese enchilada and beef taco, although I usually sub the taco for a bean tostada. For dinner I usually get the shrimp ceviche which is BOMB!! The shrimp is cooked with the citrus juice and there are tomatoes, jalapenos, and onions, served with a fried corn tortilla (essentially a shrimp tostada I suppose).  It is quite tasty - especially if you top it with that guacamole.  They also serve traditional Mexican fare like menudo (beef stomach anyone?) and nopales (cactus).  HIGHLY RECOMMEND. I promise you will go again.",

The soup tasted like a can of condensed tomato soup with some noodles thrown in. my entree was incredibly bland. I had some sort of burrito and enchilada, neither of which had any flavor at all. My boyfriend's food was bland as well. The only thing that was any good, was the refried beans... and even that wasn't all that great, because, well.. They're refried beans. :P Will not be returning unless they get a new cook. Service however, was perfect.",

The salsa was very flavorful and this is the first time I have ever had bean dip that was seasoned (very tasty)   For lunch my client and I both ordered the Ensalad Marinara - large salad for less than $10, a great price for shrimp, avocado and pico de gallo. My business partner ordered the ceviche which she also said was very flavorful.   Food was good, service was great and everyone was very friendly.  Will definitely be back when on the north side of town!",

Starting off with the chips, salsa, and bean dip the food here is excellent.  Their salsa has a unique flavor...very distinct and tasty!  Everything is served fresh!  The staff works very well together and will gladly assist even if you are not their table.  Whoever is running this place is doing a great job.  We came here at least 5 times during our visit and always left satisfied.  Everything we tried was good.  We only visited for dinner so I can't comment on the lunch.  My personal favorite was the tacos al pastor.  I highly recommend this place.",

Service was prompt and friendly, with generous portions of Nachos.  As an exciting addition to what I'm used to, they include Beans as well as Salsa!  For my entree I had the Tierra Libertad, which was delicious.  They also give you Tortilla, but they are quite large, and I was not really sure HOW you were supposed to eat the meal with the Tortilla.  I would absolutely return!",

They were only fast when it was time for the check and to charge the credit card (Usain Bolt fast). Overall it was the worst experience ever i do not recommend to any one.",

This time I had the steak cilantro which is bomb!!! The green salsa is really good! I ordered it medium rare and it was perfect! Super soft and flavorful. The tortillas are hand made on the spot! Also I'd recommend the \"gordito de camaron\" from the appetizers. Pretty much a burrito cut in 3 with shrimp and tons of melted cheese. Other dishes I've had are filete relleno and the bacon wrapped shrimp. All good! The service is on point. Only thing would be the parking. Limited very crammed space. Other than that, no complaints!!",

Inside the dining area there is an okay amount of room with options for a booth or table, but sometimes there is still a small wait to be seated since it gets so busy. There was a good amount of staff on hand to take care of the customers and during my visit our server checked on us often. We started with complimentary chips, salsa and bean dip. The salsa had a fresh taste, but I didn't care for it and it was think instead of thick which I personally prefer. Chips and bean dip were great. The beans really had a nice flavor.   The menu has a lot of options. On the back of the menu there were over 30 different combinations for lunch specials. The specials run from 10 am - 5 pm Monday thru Friday with prices ranging from $8.95 - $11.95 and meals include rice, beans and drink. Priced at $9.95 I chose a beef taco and cheese enchilada. The taco was filled with a nice portion of shredded beef and had tons of freshly grated cheese. I loved the taste of the taco shell and all of the cheese, but the beef lacked flavor for me. The cheese enchilada was really good and they didn't skimp with cheese inside or out. The beans like the dip didn't disappoint however there could have been more cheese on the beans. The rice was a bit dry, so I'll just get all beans next time. I was stuffed at the end of my meal and satisfied. Solid spot for lunch or dinner and great for the whole family.",

I was early and the service was great I got a drink and my chips very fast. Once my friends got there we ordered margaritas with an extra shot and they tasted like lime-ade not 1 drop of tequila so we sent it back. Once we received our margaritas again nothing changed it we couldn't taste any tequila. We ordered our dinner and it took forever to come out literally about 30 to 40 minutes we went through atleast 5 bowls of chips and dip. The buster Oscar was the ONLY reason we didn't get up and leave and he is the only reason this place is getting 1 star. Oscar was very engaging and entertaining he made us laugh and made our whole night! Once our food came I got the tacos de carne asada and it literally had no flavor or seasoning it tasted like I was chewing rubber I had to put guac and ton of salt I even dug in my margarita to get my lime to give it some taste. We were highly disappointed and to top it off my friend who is retired military and has been getting a military discount for the last 6 years they refused to give it to her because she wasn't currently active duty! We complained to the manager and he wasn't the most friendly or considerate of all managers wasn't much help at all he did reluctantly give us a military discount. The food was mediocre the service was decent the management was horrible I'd rather spend my money on taco bell... but Oscar is amazing that's the only good thing about this place... I will not be coming back and I doubt my friends will either",

Chips and salsa were brought to the table immediately after we were seated and the waiter came very soon after to take our drink order. The drinks came out quickly and were very cold. I ordered the Carne la Tampiquena and the New York strip was absolutely delicious! Cooked to perfection and as good or better than most steak houses I've ever been to. We also had fresh guacamole made tableside for us and it was very fresh and delicious. Three dinners and four beers for only 82 bucks? almost unbelievable. We were thank graciously by our host upon our departure. Keep up the good work! I will come here again when I visit Vegas next time.",

From the outside it looks like a small bar type restaurant but surprisingly it's a nice little decorated place that serves up some great meals!  Chips and salsa were very good and you also get a side of hot dipping beans.  The service was so wonderful.  Speedy and friendly and between the waiter and the bus boy they were always checking in on us and refilling our iced teas.  We ordered off the lunch menu and everything was under $10.  I had the enchiladas and they were tasty and full of flavor. The Tortas here are wonderful (Mexican sandwich-mmm delicious).

Have lived out here in North Las Vegas for several years and have driven up and down Craig and never knew it was there... Very good food and even better is their lunch specials are from 10 AM to 5 PM !!! They are reasonably priced and they include the beverage.. I had the number seven which is a cheese enchilada & a beef taco and my boyfriend had the three taco combo plate.. my only gripe would be that I don't like shredded beef I am more of a ground beef taco person but it tasted so good it didn't matter, but I will inquire about it on the next visit. Another nice touch is the complementary yummy chips/salsa and bean dip... I will definitely tell others about this place",

I recently have been ordering shrimp dishes off their lunch special menu and let me tell you they are all awesome! You receive a fideo soup and a drink on the side! Most dishes come with rice and beans, and I always ask for habanero salsa! The wait times are lengthy, but the food is always fresh and the customer service is great every time!   My only suggestion is order your food, wait 10 mins,   then leave home. That way you don't blow your gas in the parking lot or waste precious time cramped in the small waiting area!",

All entrees come with soup or salad. The tomato noodle(can't remember exact name) was very tasty. The tortilla chips and salsa are fresh. They make their own tortillas and you can actually watch them being made.  We had combination platters. The chille relleno was perfect-tender, just right. My husband had chicken enchiladas and enjoyed them to the last bite.  Our sides of beans and rice complimented the meal.  Oh I forgot to mentioned our Margaritas....all flavors...enjoy...",

So, my family wanted to celebrate cinco de mayo and to make it even a better celebration, my mother in law's birthday falls on the same day. We searched on Yelp for a good Mexican restaurant nearby and  Viva Zapatas came up with a 4 star on Yelp. We called in advance to check if they accepted reservations but due to being a holiday they didn't and let us know that it would be 30-40 min wait time for a large party. We drove to their location and waited patiently so they could put tables together for our party of 11 ppl. Long after we got sat at our table, menus were handed out and we got a good amount of time to see what we would order. Server took awhile to come around to see if we were ready to order. Server finally came so our party ordered food and drinks. I ordered a Michelada drink but server gave me a margarita on the rocks? I told server that he gave me the wrong drink, so he then went back to the bar to get me the right order. Worst part of our dining experience was the wait for our food, an hour for our food to come out and our server never checked on us to see how things were or to let us know what was going on with our food. Our food finally came BUT one order never came out. My aunty's Chicken Taquitos never got put in with the rest of our food order, so it took another 10 min for her food while everyone else started to eat. Poor service and server nor the busser came back to refill our glasses of water. 2 Steak Cilantro I ordered, one med-rare the other medium. Medium came out well done and med-rare came out med-well. Manager was nice to take it off the bill, but our experience was ruined and we also brought a cake to celebrate my mother in law's birthday which we ended up taking home. There were a lot of miscues from the server. Maybe it was just too busy, but who knows, maybe we'll come back and give it another try.",

This is not a huge place so getting ten people at a table is a real challenge on a friday at  noon. Luckily we waited no longer that 10 minutes(approx 63% of one margarita) and were seated and served good chips and salsa immediately, The service is always friendly here but sometimes is I a bit slow- not today. usually get the roast pork torta and it was great as usual plus is served with very good steak fries. Mexican food w/ fries? Yeah, Im home.  The margaritas were refreshing and delicious and the food seem to be enjoyed by all. Start to finish w/ 6 seperates checks(!) we were out in about 50 mins...plenty of time to drive back to work and nap the rest of the day away.",

    "text": "Finally -- made it to VZ tonight.  Had the guac -- yep, they had tomatoes, so rolled the dice...feelin' fine!  The margs were great, took PA's advice about the sarandeado sauce, too -- but had it on the shrimp...if you've not had it before, it's such a treat, particularly with their homemade flour tortillas - yowza.    We also took the advice of Chris R --ordered two shrimp tacos -- but they were not in a league I'd consider worth reordering.    And we had an a la carte relleno -- which was damn good (I'm a serious green chili fan).   The menu is huge.  The bar is, too.  The dining room isn't that big, but we got there at 6:30 tonight (Friday) and sat right down.    Let's chat a second about where it is -- going north, you'll exit Craig Road -- and that's badly marked...(seriously, just remember, to take the exit after Cheyenne.)  Then you'll turn right at the end of the ramp, but you'll need to turn left at the first light -- then take an immediate right into the parking lot with the Pilot on your left...  trust me, finding the street number is impossible.  The menu is very similiar to the other Michoacans -- which means you'll get bean dip and salsa with your chips when you sit - and the other thing I've found pretty consistent about the Michoacans is that service is really terrific.  They're eager to please, happy to replace anything if it's not to your liking -- and the prices are reasonable.    All in all, for a 110 degree day in Vegas, a trip to Craig Road for a frozen marg and some tasty dishes, that I honestly hadn't ventured to try at the others, made us happy.  There are certainly plenty of interesting dishes on the menu that caught my eye -- so I'd go back - and since we've got a Michoacan pretty much down the street (Viva), that's saying something.     Gracias, Poly.",

If you are looking for flavorful authentic Mexican dishes then Viva Zapatas is your spot! The service was top notch. Our waiter always made sure that we were well taken care of. When we were finished and asked for a box to go, the bus boy came over and packaged it up for us which was a very polite gesture. We will be back!",

    "text": "A-OK.  Even though I may occasionally forget my own definition of the terms, I believe there is a difference between food and cuisine.  Respectively, this is the difference from just getting some yummy eats and a dining, gastronomical experience.  Typically, I also have a problem with this, because I find cuisine only marginally more enjoyable, and sometimes, I disagree that it justifies the price-hike.  I'm a foody -- not a cuisine-y.  Yet, if we can turn a $6 burger into a $60 burger by changing the meat, I guess it would be hypocritical to say a difference in use of cheese, tomato, and corn can make cuisine.  Anyway, I came here thinking I was just going to get some Mexican food, but instead I found myself getting some Mexican cuisine.  I'm not saying I was disappointed, but I wasn't pleasantly surprised either.  Usually when dealing with cuisine, it means you have to also wait a little longer to get in and get out.  Here was no different.  I just wouldn't figure the place next to a gas station as classy, but the place really is quite so.  The staff is very professional; the bar is VERY well stocked with tequila; and the decor is above-par.  Though you do have to pay for all this in the end.  Unfortunately, I broke my own rule for trying a Mexican establishment new to me: I usually get carnitas so I have an equal point of comparison.  Instead I got the taco salad off their lunch menu because of a recommendation, and because I wasn't looking to spend as much as I could have here.  While I we waited, we got the obligatory chips and salsa.  As a special note, they also provide frijoles without having to ask for it.  I decided to go one further, and asked to have some salsa verde as well.  The salsa verde here comes out piping hot, but either way, all three were pretty good dips.  The taco salad comes in either beef or chicken, and I opted for the latter.  A risky decision as most of my experiences with shredded white meat chicken have been unappetizingly dry, but the waiter assured me.  He was no liar.  Possibly the best execution of Mexican shredded chicken I've tasted to date.  The size of the whole thing wasn't too bad, but for the price, I probably should try something else next time.  So for not quite being my thing, I still enjoyed myself enough.",

I think that the interior design was nice with all of the items on the wall.",

My husband and I have tried many of the different options, and used Yelp to guide us, and we have enjoyed our trips here every time! (We are very picky when it comes to our Mexican food.) It has authentic Mexican food, live music on the weekends, a very friendly staff, and a great atmosphere.   Parking can be a little tight when they are busy, so I would try and come a little earlier if you can.",

Great welcoming atmosphere, great drinks and of course that homemade cooking. Especially the handmade tortillas! Flautas are so good, menudo , fajitas delicious, tacos de lengua were to die for and the fried ice cream & flan are a great way to end your dining experience. Shout out to Jesus & Ramon for the great experiences we have had these past 8 years, you all do a fantastic job welcoming & taking care of your customers. We hope to get back there in September!",

FOOD Complimentary Chips and salsa (3.5 stars): Come with a bean dip and a salsa dip. I liked the bean dip more.   Soup that comes with meal (3 stars): Pretty good actually. Noodles inside were good. Broth is like a tomato chicken broth.    Guacamole (3.5 stars): Good guac but I've had better.    Shrimp fajitas (3 stars): Shrimp were way overcooked, pretty chewy. Rice and beans were good. They have hand made tortillas, which were okay. I used to live in SD where there are tons of Mexican restaurants that do hand made tortillas and they taste so much better.   Complimentary Birthday Churros (2 stars): Not very soft. Caramel sauce wasn't so great with it either. Nice of them to give something for birthdays though! But these churros are on the regular dessert menu also, wouldn't recommend them. They also sing to you and put a sombrero on you for your birthday.   SERVICE (5 stars):  Our server was awesome. On top of everything we asked for. Waters were always getting filled. And once we told him there were vegetarians in the group he made sure to tell them what they could and couldn't eat.   ATMOSPHERE (3.5 stars): Place isn't that big but it's a good size, make reservations if u can, it was packed when we go there but we had reservations.    PARKING: Parking is tight. The lot is weird so it takes a while to get in some of the spots.   Overall if you need to go to some kind of restaurant around this area it works. But nothing spectacular. If you have a big group they do a good job with service.",

We like the fact that they also serve a bean dip with the chips and each meal you order comes with fiedo (noodle) soup which most of the time has a great flavor. - We like to add a squeeze of lime to the soup. Food portions are decent and flavorful.  We look forward to continued visits. The 3 Amigos",

I was quickly seated and brought water, chips, salsa and a bean dip with a little cheese in it I think. Their chips tasted very fresh with a great crunch and the bean dip was a really nice surprise. The salsa had a touch of heat but not overly spicy and was a nice thick consistency.   Before my meal came out I also got a cup of fidello soup. I've never had it before and it was okay but I didn't finish it.   I ordered the combo with a chile relleno and a green chili pork burrito. It came out very quickly and looked really good. It also tasted as good as it looked. The chili relleno had a thin batter and a tasty sauce. It was also stuffed with oozy gooey cheese. The pork burrito was excellent too. The verde sauce had a little kick and the meat was very well flavored and still tender and juicy.   I was in and out in about 45 minutes and the service was quick and nice. The decor is also very good, done in a much more authentic and traditional style without the tackiness of some chain places.   I rarely crave Mexican food but I'd come back here and if you ever find yourself in the desert business centers of North Las Vegas, it's worth a try.",

Doesn't matter what meat you pair it with, ....the mole is always rich and hearty. The kids menu has great options and many add ons. Their freshly made guacamole is on top of the order list. It pairs great with the house chips, beans and salsa. If you're okay with some extra calories, order a side of their freshly handmade flour tortillas... you won't regret it! And of course, don't forget the margaritas, they serve them frozen or on the rocks! Definitely, a must try spot for great mexican food options.",

Anyway we sat at the bar and was quickly greeted. The bartender was awesome, and answered a few questions we had about the menu. We both got margaritas, nothing too crazy.   So to start off, they drop off warm chips, salsa and beans. And man. The salsa is amazing, you can taste that the peppers were roasted. You can see the small flakes of charring in the dip. Had a small kick to it, but not bad. Small kick! And the bean dip was also to die for.   I had the Carne Asada Villa. It came with rice, beans, half a grilled jalapeno, and grilled scallion. The steak was a little tough, but still had great flavor. I wrapped it in my fresh warm tortilla. Ate half and saved the other half for later!  My friend had the floutas (sp?) with beef. I didn't have a taste because he wasn't sharing. I assume that's because he didn't want to give me any! Haha. He raved about the floutas and also saved the rest for later. Maybe we weren't hungry? Or maybe .. these were pretty large portions!   Anyway, come here for authentic food, some live tunes and drinks. (Or video poker). Casual spot to be with friends!",

    "text": "We've eaten several times at Zapatas over the last couple of years and the food has always been consistently great.  The decor leans toward the traditional Mexican restaurant with art, artifacts, and posters reflecting Mexican culture. The effect is warm, welcoming, and it just feels right. The service from our waitress, Jessica, was friendly, fast, and attentive.  In the past we've had the shrimp fajitas and they've always been fresh, hot, and tasty.  I've had the biria de chivo (goat braised in beer) several times and enjoyed it immensely, but it's not for the timid, it has a strong taste, but once you add all the condiments it's perfection.  Today we had the toreados con queso, shrimp quesadilla, and the tecala, (chile relleno and green chili pork and bean burrito).  The meal started off with chips, beans, and salsa.  The beans were addictive and the salsa was smoky and very spicy (kind of strange tasting but I couldn't stop eating it). The toreados were just awesome-cheesy, spicy, and rich. The spice level is not for the heat averse. The shrimp quesadilla was huge, cheesy, and delicious.  The chile relleno was rich and satisfying, and the pork was tender and flavorful.  My only quibbles were that I asked for all beans on the dish and it came with all rice, but that was quickly corrected, and the burrito was supposed to have beans and didn't which I didn't notice till much later. These minor issues in no way interfered with the enjoyment of the food.",

However I cannot in good conscience give high stars to a restaurant who limits a military discount to \"just the active duty member\". If you are going to offer a discount it should be extended to their family members at the table also. Not just the military members meal. Seriously?! Who does that? We used to get the discount off the whole ticket. Not sure when that changed. Been going to this restaurant ages. Going to rethink that now. There are plenty of other options in Mexican cuisine. Those who do offer the \"whole\" table... children and the spouses of military a discount without them being present. It may seem I'm being petty over a few dollars. It's just the way I was treated when I enquired. When I took my children without my husband. Shame on this restaurant being so close to a military installation and being this stingy. Especially when every time I go their is plenty of military handing over their money. Keeping this business open.",

Also, last time we were there and asked for military discount, the guy told us they give discount only if we are in uniform.

The chili rellenos are incredible, the cilantro steak was the best cilantro dish I've ever had & the drinks are cheap. The prices here are very reasonable (we had drinks, an appetizer, and two entrees for $50). We were in Vegas for 4 days & visited Viva Zapatas twice, we will be back next summer & intend to visit this place again.  Also, the decor is very tasteful and interesting to look at & avoids the cheesiness that many restaurants get into. The thing we liked the most about this place is that it's a bit out of the way but they really focus on a comfortable, friendly atmosphere, which you don't really find on the strip.",

Even though we showed up about 45 minutes early for our reservation, they already had our table ready and were happy to seat us!  The awesome staff never let our drinks get less than half full, which meant a lot of running around for them that did not go unappreciated. They brought out all ten of our orders at once, hot but not so hot that we couldn't dig in immediately. The salsa is fabulous here--it's hotter than most restaurants I've been to, and peppery to boot! LOTS of choices on the menu, plus a whole bunch of lunch specials.  The only downside I can think of is their squishy, uneven parking lot, but my boss managed to navigate it in his pick-up, so I guess it's not an issue.  Service is great, food is great, bathrooms are clean (check out the sinks!) Absolutely will be back next time I volunteer at Three Square. :)",

LOL OOOOO How wrong I was. So I gave in and we decided to eat there. O.M.G. Yum! I got the green pork plate, taco, enchilada and burrito. YUM! The staff was friendly, food was perfect, I love their bean and salsa sauces with the chips! Only bad thing is the Cadillac Margarita was THE best drink I've had in a while. Should be because the drink alone was $18!!! #$%$%^ yea....no prices on the menu always mean $%^$%^& on the bill....but other than that I'd go back for sure!",

My usual hotel wasn't able to accommodate my third night (a busy Friday) and I wound up choosing a place that had great reviews. That decision was a good one, and I followed it up by trying out Viva Zapatas due to its following on Yelp. First the bad - parking. Located adjacent to a busy service station, the parking is extremely limited. I actually waited several minutes while two people were talking outside their respective cars. I am glad I had the patience. The title should be reversed; it's a cantina & restaurant. The vibe, even on a weekday lunch, is lively, especially with the sporting events on the TVs. I actually sat at the bar -- there was a short wait for tables. But my server was quick, friendly and efficient. It took a while to get through the menu; I love tough choices.  I wound up choosing the Ayoxustla combo (chile relleno & beef taco) and enjoyed everything. It was tasty, filling and the service was excellent.  I'll come back again. It's worth the extra few minutes to enjoy a really good meal.",

    "text": "In Love again! I asked around for a good romantic place to take a date. The name Viva Zapata's kept coming up by friends recommending it. The name didn't sound very romantic, it sounded more revolutionary, but maybe that's what I needed some kind of revolution in my life since nothing else was working out, So I decided to give it a try.   We agreed to meet there at eight, but I got there at seven, I didn't want to be late  and I wanted to get a feel of the place and make sure it met my expectations. As i walked in i knew i would like the place, nice decor dim lighting and live music. I proceeded to the bar and ordered a margarita and listened to the guitar man play someone Else's life with his fingers.  it was a really good margarita it actually had tequila in it. The bartender brought some complimentary chips and salsa and some bean dip. I didn't want to start eating since my date hadn't arrived yet, but one chip loaded with bean dip wouldn't hurt. After two bowls of chips and bean dip and three margaritas I decided to order an appetizer, Something light, so I ordered the seviche and let me tell you, it was the best seviche I have tried this far from the ocean, it couldn't be any fresher or tastier. It was soo good I decided to stick with the mariscos (seafood) and ordered the camarones borrachos, (like me)  Shrimp sauteed with garlic, spices and tequila, the perfect combination. You just can't go wrong with that, It was out of this world goodness!  All in all I had a wonderful time.  When you get caught between great food, a nice romantic ambiance and a guitar, you can't help  It but to fall in love. ....My date? Didn't make it.....But I fell in love nonetheless..... with the food at Viva Zapata's.                                                   PS.  Don't text and drive. You don't want to miss dinner!",

Service was impecable. Drinks , salsa and chips NEVER went below half before getting refilled.Impressive!  I am not giving 5 stars because of its location. Why so far?? and why behind a truck stop??   What would i recommend? The coca cola steak, carne asada and the refried beans. Epic win plates!

The three stars is only for the glorious days of old.  Service was extremely slow whereas normally its lighting fast. It was pretty clear the waiter forgot to put in our order. The chips were burned and we received few drink refills. They were busy (as they always are), but I'm used to tthe service being attentive and speedy. Not today. We were considering leaving when...  FINALLY! Here comes the food! The beans were inedibley salty, and no ones food - even those we have enjoyed many times before - was any good. Cold, bland, oversalted...  The worst of all was the Tacos de camarones (shrimp tacos). I'd never tried them and I was excited to give them a shot.   Supposedly these are \"moms recipe\", but I really doubt she chopped shrimp into tiny peices and deep fried until it was no longer recognizable as shrimp (it could have been chicken, hell I dont know). What only can be described as fried matter was overflowing from my tortillas and my only hope was a large cup of sauce they brought with the meal. Nope... a room temp thick, heavily mayo based sauce flavored with chipotle seasoning. C'mon guys.   My wife had the carne asada con rajas y crema which is usually out of this world. Today it suffed the same bland, oversalted fate. A light but robust sauce was replaced with an overly rich and salty goo that covered what would otherwise be decent carne asada.   Our two other guests (also long time diners here) were similarly disappointed.  Every place has a bad day now and again, but I really hope its not a sign of things to come.",

    "text": "We are new to Las Vegas from Northern California, where we were spoiled with good quality Mexican food. Again we turned to Yelp for local guidance, and found Viva Zapatas with high marks.   The location is a good 12-15 min drive from our Aliante home . Not keen or impressed with the area of this location, we almost had second thoughts...  (We are sure glad we didn't pass up this restaurant.)    Parking is limited (2) stars, as we entered there was a nice feel and layout. The whole restaurant was nicely decorated for Christmas (classy, not tacky). There was a gentleman on a stool playing live music and singing which added a nice touch.    It was Saturday night at 6 pm, we did not have to wait for a table and were seated immediately, the host was friendly and attentive. We were sat in a booth right next to the VERY busy kitchen door (1) Star, I was not pleased, and could tell this was going to be a very loud, busy spot. The table was clean, neatly set as we were handed the menus. The menu is very well put together, many quality selections. I had a very difficult time reading the menu as the interior lighting was very low. It created a very pleasing ambiance, however tough to read the menu. ( This is where the kitchen door constantly opening allowing the bright florescent light to shine onto my menu was actually handy).   We searched for a drink menu, hoping for quality specialty margaritas but did not find such items listed on the menu. Our server arrived table side quickly to take our drink order, and was able to recommend a few margaritas that sounded good. I ordered the house Cadillac Margarita on the rocks w/ salt (large) and the wife ordered a Mango margarita blended.   We had time to review the menu and make our selections, however very tough to do so. The menu is packed with amazingly described selections. I settled in on the steak fajitas (rare) and anyone who loves their meat rare knows that finding a good Mexican restaurant that will honor that request, and deliver is few and very far between, its my little test on the quality of service. My wife ordered the chicken mole, and we ordered a Tamale for the table.   Our drinks arrived, my large margarita did not let me down in size. The taste on the other hand was average, nothing special. I found myself a bit disappointed having expected a place like this to have fresh hand squeezed lime juice sweetened with a simple syrup for there mixture. This obviously was a store bought margarita mix. My wife's was tasty, but again a store bough mango mix and margarita blend used. Drinks right down the middle (2.5).   The chips, salsa, and re-fried beans provided were wonderful. Chips were warm, the salsa was hand made with quality ingredients, and the beans were also well seasoned and hand made.    Our entrees arrived with an average wait, the timing was perfect. The plate presentation and appearance was wonderful, the food looked amazing. The portions were very big, and looked like each plate was prepared with care. A nice added bonus we did not expect or order was a home made soup offered with dinner, small 6 to 8 oz portion of soup. I would describe it as a cross between a home made tomato soup and chicken soup. The flavor was very good, someone who knows what they are doing back there took time making this broth. Very flavorful and light.     Chicken Mole: The Mole sauce was very good, not as heavy and bold as expected, but certainly not a bad Mole by any means. The star of the dish was the two pounded boneless chicken breasts. Again I expected a over cooked dry chicken saved by a rich Mole sauce to cover. Not here, this chicken was amazingly moist and juicy. Rich flavor, and i highly suspect they brine the breast. It was perfectly cooked (5+) stars.    Steak Fajitas: The plate looked amazing, smelled wonderful and was sizzling at the table. The meat looked plump and not over cooked. The flour tortillas were hand made in the restaurant, warm and amazing. I took a piece of meat to test, and it was PERFECTLY cooked rare with great flavor and well seasoned. I have never been a guacamole fan, my wife gives me so much grief. I have never eaten guac in a restaurant with any meal. The way this was going, I had to try theirs. WOW, very tasty, properly seasoned and balanced with cilantro, onion, lime, and tomato. I actually used it on my Fajita roll.    Tamale: A very tasty and well balanced Tamale. The flavor was very good. The masa to meat portion was perfect,     In closing, this by far is some of the best tasting Mexican food I have had, and we have had some great Mexican in Northern California. We have found our spot when the desire for Mexican comes knocking. Great food and restaurant. The service is top notch. Even though we had some things we did not enjoy, I have to give this restaurant (5) stars for service and food. Great job, and we will be back very soon.  Food - (5) Star Location - (3) Star Parking - (2) Star Service - (5) Star Ambiance - (4.5) st",

The fideo soup, the homemade chips and salsa, the steak, the burritos, tacos... Anything I have ever had is DELISH.  Very nice bar area as well as dine in area for kids.  Sometimes there is a live mariachi man playing as well.  Great place to go for big family dinners, or on a date :-) Love it ask for the chips and salsa at the table and they are free!",

Parking can be tough if you are coming in the evening during the weekend. Drinks are great and guac is made right in front of you from fresh ingredients like the tradiational Mexican restaurants typically do.  Decor is adorable and service was fine.

We went ahead and ordered two a la carte burritos hoping it would be worth it/generously portioned/something to justify the prices. Hostess was friendly and the food came out not particularly speedy but not slow enough to complain, and they did get our order correct (no easy feat, I am a picky eater.) The food itself however was average at best. The chile colorado was a little bland and tough, and was the ONLY thing in the burrito. Definitely would not have been worth paying full-plate prices. In fact I think I've had better tasting burritos for much less elsewhere. Overall the place is OK, but we are going to keep looking for our Mexican \"spot.:",

As a business traveler if you find yourself returning to the same spot rather than seeking out new locations, you know that there has to be something special about it.   Lets start with the salsas. Obviously homemade you get a red salsa with a bit of a kick and a refried bean salsa. I'm not the biggest refried bean gal, but I do really like this salsa. Last time I was here I finished that bowl...  I had 2 enchiladas with mole sauce and carne which the meat was perfectly seasoned and the cheese was stretching out of the enchiladas like a perfectly melted cheese should. Mole sauce had great flavor and punch and elevated the enchiladas to a new level.  Service was great, the lone guitarist was playing all night long and everyone was super friendly.

But there is those times where you are like screw it and being new to north Vegas it was a good excuse... well it was settled today..   I had a craving for Fideo soup.. I ordered a bowl to share with my girl, obviously not the only thing I wanted to eat.. but when I received it, it was warm and not hot kinda ruined it but I didn't want to complain...  For my main course I ordered a wet Asada burrito.. I'm sorry but that thing was BLAND.. nothing stood out in that hot mess everything kind of just blended and got lost together...salt works wonder when you know how to use it right..   The only thing I will not complain about is the hospitality in the establishment. Our hostess was nice and our server was on point with service.  Sorry guys but I won't be back.   The horchata was good though!",

I love their sopapillos, the chorizo ones, the carne asada sopapillos are not that great. Their chips and bean dip are addicting so prepare to be stared at when you continuously ask for refills lol ( it will happen) . The steak burrito and Steak Entree are also a hit. A huge plus are the home made tortillas made to order. You can even order a pack to go. I've been here several times and have ordered take out as well. On sick days I've been by to pick up their Caldo de Res. Big chunks of res and plenty of veggies.   Oh and of course you must always try a Margarita which they make pretty good ones.",

From the live music, to the very diverse menu, they really nailed it.  I had the Carne Tampiquena (sp?), and it was fantastic.  Although cooked a little under, the quality ingredients and seasonings more than compensated...plus it probably tasted better at that temperature.  My only criticism was that the margaritas were too sweet--but that's probably reflective more of what people come in wanting.  I'll definitely be back and would recommend this place to anyone looking for a great meal!  Oh...and come on a Saturday night for the music.",

The service sometimes can be a little slow, but usually the wait staff is on top of it.   Parking is always a problem when they are busy.

We ordered beef fajitas and they gave us chicken fajitas.  In addition, the chicken was over cooked and dry.   They also charge you extra for chips and salsa.  Their salsa has an odd smoky vinegar taste.  Lastly, the guacamole that comes with the other meal tasted like it came out of a can. The best part when we called to let them know about the mistake, they told us they do not offer beef fajitas???  Will not be returning.  We always count on Yelp for recommendations but this was a big fail.  Trying to figure out how they got so many good reviews.",

We arrived on a weeknight, and I inquired about happy hour at the hostess stand.  The hostess didn't know if it was happy hour, and had to go check.  She confirmed that it was happy hour, but then took off again, and the three of us stood awkwardly in the entrance waiting for a while for her to seat us.  It didn't seem so busy to warrant that wait, but we waited a while to order and to be served throughout the night.  Our food was good, except for the ceviche appetizer.  Something about it was not right - it lacked that nice bite of lime, and the fish was not prepared like I'm used to - the consensus at the table was that it was a miss - and most of it was still in the dish when we left.  The pastor tacos were good - they had pineapple which is often left off of pastor tacos, the table side guac was a nice treat, and my friend's chicken dish was enjoyed by everyone at the table.  We also had a great server - very friendly and helpful.  The uneven service definitely affected our experience, but I would still try it again because I think they have a good menu with a nice variety of authentic dishes.",

Also, a must is the prepared to order guacamole. The waiter made it table-side, with input from us. It was delicious. Service was excellant, and noticed they had homemade sangria...For next time.

I and several other non-Spanish speaking groups were left to our own  instinct with the wait staff unwilling to explain the menu without giving the non-welcoming attitude that we were just too much trouble. So I ordered the Cognac Chicken while my wife ordered the Beef Tacos. The \"Chips\" delivered to the table were either old or cooked/re-fried at too low a temperature since they were Oily. The Bean dip was average and the tomato based dipping sauce was a dark, hot, bitter,  variety that is unique to this place. The Cognac Chicken cooked with canned mushrooms and onions actually had a strange sweet taste and the accompanying Rice and Beans were nothing special. The place was very clean as I observed one cook diligently changing gloves when interrupted at her station (excellent). I can't say anything really Great NOR Bad about this place, however I would not go out of my way to eat here as there are so many better options for the price. $ 45.00 for two counting Tip - No Alcohol, Appetizer nor Dessert.",

I come here often with my daughter (16 mos), because they take very good care of you. They bring out a small plate of rice, veggies and meat for the little one(s) very early, sometimes before I've made up my mind about what I want to eat.  The tortillas are made fresh, you can watch the lady make them, and so is the guacamole, which they'll put together right in front of you. Oh, and if you think decorations stop at the bathroom door, think twice. These bathrooms are NICE! I know that's an odd thing to notice, but it did make an impression on me. :) They're also honest about their mistakes. My friend and I wanted to try a new dessert they were offering. We had already paid for it, when the manager found out they didn't have anymore, so he gave us TWO desserts of our choice, even though we had only paid for one.",

I got the lunch special chili colorado with fresh-made corn tortillas, and it was really tasty, as well as reasonably priced. Since this is way out in the boonies, I doubt the typical Vegas weekend warrior would ever find their way into this place (although who knows, it is Vegas after all), I'd recommend it if you happen to be passing through on I-15 and want something better than your typical Chevy's/Mexican chain.",

It is located on Craig road near the I15 and right next to the Pilot truck stop on your way north. I made that mistake for to long and then finally convinced my self to try it. It has a small parking lot and even  walking to the door you are still not sure ... but when you enter - Oh Yes. The decor is rustic with historical items placed around the large dining room and bar. The booths are great and the staff is very friendly. A great atmosphere with live music on most every night. ( keyboards or guitar)  The traditional mexican food is super, the guacamole is out of sight and the sea food dishes are excellent. It is totally inexpensive and you will leave \"Stuffed to the Max  - and happy that you are.\"  It is well out of the way for most people, but if you have that need to visit the Cannery Casino, it is right on the way and should not be missed.  Just don't let the location throw you off from the enjoyment of a supurb mexican dining experience.",

We went on a Monday night, and made reservations since there were going to be about 10 of us. We only had to wait about 10 min. after we got there, no problems at all. It isn't very big, but it's decorated wonderfully and it doesn't feel crowded at all, just right. One thing I loved is that the entire time we were there there was a 1 man mariachi playing a guitar and singing live. I don't know if he is there all the time or not, but I loved it...just added to the ambiance.  We ordered an appetizer of Queso Fundido con Chorizo in addition to the complimentary chips, salsa, and frijoles. Oh my goodness! It was the best, cheesiest, sausage-y goodness ever!  Our table also ordered a pitcher of Cadillac Margs...the \"pitcher\" was more of a carafe, but the margs were delish!  With 10 of us there were a variety of entrees ordered and everyone loved theirs. Mine was a cheese enchilada and chili relleno, both were delicious.  Flan for dessert topped off the evening perfectly.   When I'm in Vegas again I will definitely go back!",

It's not too fancy though, I'm not about to shove out $20-25 for a carne asada plate when $10-15 seems more reasonable.   I had the green enchiladas with chicken and they were delicious. The chips, the refried beans, and the rice were great! I wasn't a fan of the salsa that came with the chips, but that's just me. My friends liked it and I'm a firm believer that you really can't have it ALL.   The service was professional and attentive. The setting was a little loud, but when I go to a Mexican restaurant I expect to have live (or some form of) music and to enjoy the general \"ambiente\".  This place had just that.   I will definitely be back with adults only to have some adult beverages also. If I could just place this restaurant closer to my house in Henderson!",

I've heard all great things from everyone over the years but never had the chance to experience it.    We met some friends there on Friday night.  The parking was a nightmare.  They had a huge section chained off where I believe alot of their customers usually park.  We ended up parking at the 7/11 and our friends had to park across the street in a vacant lot.  There was a 20 minute wait and there were people everywhere inside and outside waiting.  We decided to get a drink at the bar.  The bar is big however every seat was taken.  There were some 2 seat high tables on the side so we decided to grab one and just order drinks at the bar.  So taking a look around I felt like I took one step into Mexico.  Colorful flags draped the ceilings. The decor is fabulous.  I was already sold one minute into the place. There were a couple large parties which occupied a lot of their tables and a lot of their attention...which is probably reason for everyone waiting in the front.  We were finally seated and immediately served fresh chips, salsa and bean dip.  All of it was fantastic.  The warm bean dip was my favorite.  The BF and I ordered the chicken fajitas to share and the tortillas were fresh and homemade.  It was just enough food for us with all the chips we ate! ;).    Ambiance - Beautiful authentic Spanish atmosphere!  Service - as quick and attentive as they could be being there was a full house and large parties.  Food - a definite score.  And Parking - a bummer but we lived.  Overall good time had by all!  It wasn't just a meal it was an experience!  Totally whole heartedly recommended!  We will be back soon.",

The place is nice inside.  It has a large bar and different dining separated areas so it  has some private and quaint booths and tables.  The service was excellent.  The waiters were fast but not in a hurry.    The food.  It was eleven in the morning so I felt like breakfast.  I had some eggs with shredded beef and my friend had the flautas.  It was all good.  I don't think it is authentic Mexican food, but it is quality Mexican food as the masses know it.    I do want to go back at dinner time and try some more items on their menu to get a better idea for how good the food is.",

If u actually turn the lights up or use the light on ur phone you'll see that the place is really dirty and not clean.  My kid dropped his toy and I had to use my phone to look for it under the booth and it looks like it hasn't been swept in yrs.  The menus have old crusty food still on it and haven't been updated or replaced since the last time I was here in 2006.

The service was very attentive, especially to make sure my iced tea was filled. Food came out rather quick, too, which was nice.  What I didn't like: Not having a tamale specific option. I had to order them a la carte or with an option I didn't want. I also didn't like the condition of the menus. When a restaurant's (large) pages stick together, I want hand sanitizer provided. There's no reason for them to stick together if you would wipe them down daily.  The food was just too good so it gets 4 stars.",

Once we finally got our order in we waited about 30 mins for our food. Our food had no tatse. We were there a total of 2 hours. You also have to pay for refills which we didnt know because the menu said nothing about it. My husband and I ended up spending $60. If we knew that we would be spending that kind of money it definitely wouldn't have been here.",

Comes with a side of the normal spicy and bean dip (mixture of both is amazing!)   I love the decor in this place with the colorful paper banners everywhere.   Got the usual Chile Verde (= lean pork stewed in green chile sauce) and it was extremely tasty and full of flavor.  Probably the best I've ever tasted, just because it really tasted like it had been marinated and then stewed in the chile verde. They brought it out piping hot with the normal sides of spanish rice and refried beans.  The el burro burrito was massive! Way bigger than an over-stuffed chipotle burrito, so for $9.99 you definitely get your money's worth.  Each of the meals came with Fideo which is like a pasta/tomato soup. I thought it was okay, not really for me. It was more like a watered down version of stringy spaghetti O's to me.   Service was awesome. The minute my glass of water went empty, they topped it off right away. They even pack your left over food at your table, so you're not left alone trying to pack it yourself.   I will def come back when I get a craving for some real good chile verde.",

One would think I would have had my fill of Comida after El Sombrero but as my Uncle Chuck is fond of saying, in my family Mexican Food is just called \"Food\".  To start with, the exterior looks suspect, parked in the shadow of a gas station and just off the I15 Interstate Freeway, one would expect this place to be yet another Gringo Mexican Chevy's Franchise -- but no, far from it, this place serves up some serious SouthWest Mex. I ordered the platter with chicken enchilada, taco and tostada -- y ay caramba! Sabrosa! Even if you don't gamble, it would be worth moving to Vegas and finding a home midway between this place and El Sombrero.",

They don't state this anywhere on their menu! That's called False advertising.",

She did that on purpose so we wouldn't know what she was saying, joke is on her, we are Filipino and understood everything. It's really rude to speak another language to your coworkers  in front of your customers. Unprofessional and such a shame because the food is awesome.   *went back a second time to see if anything has changed, and literally the entire staff spoke Spanish to us. Geeze. I guess it's a must to learn how to speak Spanish if you want to dine here.",

Very fatty and the plate came with these huge stewed pieces of pork still on the bone. I haven't eaten cheap cuts of meat like that since I was a kid growing up in la. My torillas never came even when I was complaining and sending the food back. The staff was very apologetic and tried to get me to order another dish but as u can imagine...I had no appetite after that. I wouldn't waste my time trying to come back here.",

    "text": "This honestly is a little, hidden gem of a restaurant in north Las Vegas. I work right down the street so this is usually my go to place on pay day Friday's.  They have tons of lunch specials but my favorites are the taco salad and camarones con rayas y crema. The taco salad is huge and comes with everything you'd ever desire. I always mix in some of the salsa too in order to spice it up a bit. The camarones are probably my number one favorite, but they're a bit pricier around $11. This plate comes with rice, beans and your choice of tortillas. The shrimp has a creamy sauce along with some peppers. Honestly it's so good, you just have to try it!   The lunch specials here also come with a drink and one refill which is nice. The food has always been great with anything I try and I especially love their bean dip which comes complementary with any meal.   The only reason I'd give them a four star instead of five is how the service can be shoddy sometimes. It's either very good and quick or terribly slow and not very attentive. I guess it just depends what day of the week you come. Either way I'll always be back for more!",

From the roasted chipotle salsa and bean dip and chips, to the well balanced sauces for their tender, juicy chicken and steak dishes. This place never fails. The staff is friendly and helpful, and they have a huge selection of tequilas which only add to the awesomeness of this place. I highly recommend coming here for the lunch specials (30 + items to choose from),  then coming back for dinner for the other dish you really wanted. Lol!",

Some dinner time we have to wait 10-15 min, but now we know better time without wait.   We always get combo menus, my option is set with Relleno and Cheese Enchilada. 1 out of 10 comes with super seedy-Relleno, but 9 out of 10 comes proper sized pepper with full of cheese. Whenever we want Cheesy night with beautiful crisp chips and Fideo soup, we drive 30 min and go and eat. The best in town after 7 years of trying most of Mexican Restaurant",

Great variety of food, I won't argue the authenticity of the food since I am no authority on it, but it has all been delicious in the numerous times I've been here. They have a great selection of well-priced lunch specials, like my favorite, numero once, the two enchilada meal (and I keep forgetting if I liked the shredded chicken or shredded beef enchilada more, but you get two to mix/match). The service is relatively fast and they are fairly attentive, helping out group make it back to work before the lunch break is up. The atmosphere is pleasant, with great vibes and regalia on the walls. Some of their facilities could use some TLC, however, and I'm unsure if the bench in the front waiting area is some kind of authentic memorabilia, but it's note exactly comfortable, doesn't seat many, and takes up more space than would probably be needed for seating while you wait for your table. Other than that, great food and good service at an excellent price!",

Our server was terrible, we waited 25 minutes for our margaritas by which time our chips and salsa were gone. I had to go to the bar for our water. The soup was dropped just as our entrees arrived, and the meal just went downward from there. With SO MANY good choices out there, it really isn't necessary to return. Like so many other establishments, WHAT HAPPENED TO CUSTOMER SERVICE?!?!?!",

Everything, from the chips and salsa to the steaks to the margaritas, is fresh and delicious. The steaks are so tender, I'd rather eat here than the new steakhouse down the street. The different sauces are amazing!   If you crave authentic Mexican food with excellent waitstaff and some good live music thrown in, you need to try Viva Zapatas. I wish I lived closer, I'd eat there every week.",

In fact I ordered several items off the menu and literally could not stomach eating one of the dishes.  I took one bite and knew i did not like it and they refused to take it off the bill.  I had to pay $18 for something I didn't even eat.  And to top it off, they kept speaking Spanish to me and I'm Asian!!!  Not sure what all the good reviews are about.  I'm not from the area (I'm from CA) so maybe I have a different idea of customer service and authentic Mexican is.  Won't visit here again",

    "text": "I was so glad to stumble on to this place!  This Mexican Eatery has been here for about 16 years, so not sure how we did not know of this place.  As soon as you park your car you can already sniff out some wonderful aromas.    Upon entering you are greeted and your eyes will immediately start admiring some of the Mexican Revolution pieces placed throughout the restaurant.  Totally transports you to that era.  Just awesome! There are also 2 ladies making fresh tortillas.    We were seated and immediately greeted with some chips accompanied by salsa and warm refried beans.   The salsa was not great but the beans were very tasty. I knew I wanted to try their Menudo but I am always hesitant to try Menudo anywhere but home since it can be horribly executed at times. But I took my chances and I was so glad I did.  It was delicious and came with fresh made corn and flour tortillas and all the little condiments that make this dish alone something I would come back for.  The bowl is very big and I definitely took some home. It may seem a little steep at $12 but it really is a meal all on its own.  I also sampled some of my husband's combo which consisted of a beef tamale, enchilada, chile relleno with beans and rice and a side order of an asada taco.   The tamale had good flavor but was a little on the dense side, the enchilada was very tasty as well as the chile relleno but the taco was horrible, beans and rice were nice.   For dessert we were recommended their Fried Ice Cream, I am not usually a fan of if anywhere else but we opted to try especially since they were sold out of their flan. It was actually really good but I would not call it Fried Ice Cream, it was more like a round ball of vanilla ice cream coated with some cinnamon toast crunch and coconut flakes.  Still was very tasty.   Service was excellent and overall very nice place I will definitely try this place again and maybe try some their amazing looking drinks we saw leaving their bar to accompany my Menudo. Salud!",

The service was excellent; the wait for food was pretty average but there was always a server checking on us and making sure our drinks were full.   My boyfriend had a beef burrito that was so large, he had plenty to take to work to eat! And he loved it, also said it was even better as leftovers. I ordered the carne asada mixed greens salad; there was a bit too much dressing for my liking the meat was cooked beautifully and I really liked the lime dressing. we had sopapillas for dessert and they were delicious! perfectly flaky and the sauce was very yummy. I really wanted to ask for another order!  we can here on a Thursday night (7:30pm) and there was plenty of seating and no wait, so didn't experience the rush. all in all, we really like the place and plan to come back next time we need a Mexican fix!",

Our favorite time to go is during lunch as they offer fantastic and satisfying lunches.   The restaurant is clean, the waitstaff is very prompt, and everything runs very smoothly. The manager is always walking around checking on tables, and I always see the hostess wiping menus down when I'm walking in and out. The way I can really tell they're clean is by how spotless their bathroom is!   The only thing I could complain about is their waiting area is almost nonexistent and their parking lot is awful..

The house tomato soup was the best thing I ate on our vacation. The Habanero Salsa is just hot enough to have a little kick but just mild enough where I was happily eating as much of it as I could before our meal came. When our meal did arrive it came with  fresh, homemade, tortillas!   The food easily deserves five stars and the service is superlative. Our drinks and chips were always full. Did I mention the soup?  When we arrived around 3:30 on a Monday afternoon every seat was taken and there was at least three parties in front of us. There is tiny place for about four to five people to stand in the door but after that you can wait outside in the shade. This San Francisco kid can't handle 108 in the parking lot. I don't mind waiting for an excellent meal, and it was worth the wait  but I need some place to wait that has A/C. I'd still come back in 100+ degree heat and stand outside in the shade for an hour, it is that great! I'd love more than anything to give this a five star review because I'll never forget how amazing it was but there were tiny little things that need minor improvement.   When I'm within 100 miles of this gem there is a 99.98% chance I will be back.",

    "text": "This was my first visit here and it might just be my last. I decided to eat at Viva Zapatas over Que Mas mexican restaurant and I totally regretted it.  I ordered the 2 tacos combination plate with rice and beans and it was an epic fail, because this place is stingy with their meat. No joke!   There was about 2oz of meat in both tacos combined and it was disappointing to say the least. No flippin wonder there was an avalanche of lettuce in my tacos.   I paid about $12 for a crap load of rice, beans and taco shell and very very little meat. In all honesty I hate it when restaurants are stingy with their ingredients.  I was still hungry so I ended up ordering 2 additional tacos and 1 tamale and made sure to tell the waiter to ask the cook to put more meat this time around.  When the tacos and tamale came out I would quickly find out that this time around wasn't going to be any better. Even though there was more meat it tasted horrible. The beef in the tacos were super dry and the tamale was probably the worst I've ever had in my life... seriously.  Overall this was probably the worst mexican food I've ever had and I'm just wondering why in the heck it's a 4 star joint.   In a nutshell this was memorable in a very very bad way and I'm definitely crossing this joint off my foodie list for good.  Thanks but no thanks VZ!",

We went a bit out of our way during a day trip (between visiting Red Rock Canyon and Hoover Dam) to check out this place on the recommendation of a friend, and we were not disappointed.    The food is nothing fancy, but it's real, and it's good.  The guac is a highlight - made tableside, fresh and flavorful (at about half of NYC prices for the same).  The atmosphere is festive and the service attentive.  A ton of locals/regulars is never a bad sign either.",

The servers were attentive to our needs but it felt like overkill being watched as I ate. As soon as I put down my bowl, someone was ready to take it away.

I would love to try all of the family recipes most of all because those are truly unique. The live music, the wait staff, and overall service are top notch. It is a louder restaurant, especially when someone has a birthday, but great for families and groups, while still maintaining enough intimacy for a possible date night environment.  The food itself shows devotion to small finishing touches and detail. Instead of plain rice as a side, veggies are mixed in. My dining companion ordered a burrito and it was nearly the size of a loaf of bread. For real, you will get enough food to take home, so be prepared to have a second and possibly third meal out of what you order!",

I dare say it gets close ( I said close not there) to my Mom's cooking.  Went here for brunch on a Sunday, mellow.  They bring out chips and a good salsa, next when you order they bring you SOPA!/soup as an appetizer, included. Huevos con chorizo, are great. Next time I'm in Vegas, will make the trip over to this place on my break from rolling the dice.  Worth the trek or cab ride if your looking for a hangover cure.",

Our waiter Antonio was excellent at providing excellent service by being aware of all his tables.. Making sure our chips and dips was never empty.. And his sense of humor is great.. He was always polite and always have a smile on... Their live musician has a very strong voice and very good on the guitar.. Atmosphere was dark-- setting the bar mood but really bring you into the Mexican theme..! Food was amazing-- the chips bean dip and salsa was unlimited and very delicious, I had their enchiladas de mole.. Which was rich with mole sauce but a bit too cheesy for me.. But still Sooooo Gooodddd!! You got to try this if you're ever around Nellis AFB! Or just in Vegas itself!!",

At first the prices seemed a little high, but when the food came out we found out why. The portions were large and the food was excellent. My enchiladas were just cheese but the mole sauce was delicious. Came with grilled chicken on top, side of rice & beans and yummy soup. Hubby fajita meat was seasoned well. Only came with 2 tortillas to rap but when he asked for more, they came out hot and fresh.  Only downside to this place is the parking. It's behind a gas station so the parking is very limited.",

One was so excellent I contributed to him directly. When I went alone with the kids, my waiter looked like he had no patience for us. We do not speak Spanish and he treated us like outsiders. I needed help with the menu because it is dark in there and it is hard to read. He was no place around to help. When the waiter finally did come around, he still acted like we were bothering him. So I suggest to take a Spanish speaking person with you when you go. It is too bad for the waiter but the food is good. The prices are on the high side.

We ordered one margarita each, and snacked on the chips and salsa; excellent. Soon we began to wonder if the order for margaritas had gone through to the bar. We inquired, and were told \" they will be here shortly\". After waiting 20 minutes, our margaritas finally arrived. They tasted great, but were not worth the $14 charge. We asked, and there were only 2 shots of liquor in them. We then waited an additional 30 minutes from the time we ordered our food. The food was presented well, but upon the first bite, we noticed something was off. The shredded chicken in my husband's taco salad tasted and smelled like tuna! We were convinced it was tuna, and the waitress said that it indeed wasn't. My husband didn't finish his meal or get anything else because it literally smelled so disgusting. Then, I noticed that my salad was missing 80% of the ingredients that it included on the menu, and that my grilled chicken was dry and chewy. Our service was great, that was the one upside.",

I love Mexican Food and my hubby and I have been looking for a good sit down place to go.  Viva Zapatas delivered! We went on a Sunday and there was a nice gentleman playing guitar and singing traditional mexican songs. It was a great background and not too loud.  He was really really good! You can actually get fresh homemade tortillas here!!  Yummmm.    If you are in the area or in the mood... this place is a MUST TRY!!",

The menu selection is one of the most impressive and biggest I have ever seen with regional variations to their entrees. There was no feel of commercial big-chain restaurants and the musician playing guitar and singing older traditional songs by the entrance made the place feel complete. My visiting family enjoyed every thing we ordered and I wish I had ordered the table side guacamole after seeing it made at the next table. I WILL go back there.",

Shrimp fajitas were very tasty, not overly spicy and not \"ole bay\" ish. I added some bean dip & salsa to my fajita, which made the meal over the top. First time ever to have soup in a Mexican restaurant, but now I will miss not having it to start my meal. Staff met us at the front door and never stopped attending to our needs until we left the same front door. Awesome is all I can say and glad the Yelp reviews lead me to this excellent Mexican restaurant.",

    "text": "We moved here a month ago and stumbled on this place. Since then it has become our #1 Mexican restaurant in Vegas and we have been there TWICE. The food is delicious and the chips not only come with salsa but also refried bean dip. The customer service is excellent; they will continuously check up on you and ensure all is well (to include drinks being topped off). It's a bit smaller so usually you'll have to wait a few minutes for a table/booth but I have never had to wait as long as they predict. The parking lot is a bit small too but both times we've simply parked next door and walked over. There has been live music both times but it has been acoustic etc so it isn't overwhelming. We went on Cinco de Mayo and it was great too. There were even Corona girls there passing out little Corona shawls for your beer bottles, and there were drink specials too. Love this place.",

I ordered the chile colorado.  The gave free chips with warm refried beans and salsa.  The chips tasted slightly burnt and te salsa was kinda bland.  The colorado was a litte tangy and lacked the depth of chile flavor.  The service was good.  Not worth the trip out thee but decent if you are nearby.",

I saw the great reviews of this place on Yelp and also the parking lot seemed to be pretty busy (a good sign) so we stopped in.  We were given chips and salsa to start off with along with a bowl of beans (very very bland). I am a big fan of homemade chips since it's easy and makes all the difference...these were from a bag.  There were 5 of us so we had a pretty good run of the menu to see if this place was legit. We are also from all different parts of the country so this place was given a fair shot. We ALL thought our food was pretty bad and the service was horrible as well. I had a chicken chimichanga which I didn't eat because it came as beef. When I asked to skip the salsa on top and have them put cheese she said they had to charge me an extra $1...seriously?! Beans and rice had ZERO flavor and even my 4 year old said he didn't like his food. Also I asked for tortillas that NEVER came...we asked three people for the check before finally being able to pay for horrible food...I will not go back which is a shame because I wanted this place to live up to their hype.",

There is also usually a waiting line, which moves rather quickly, but there is no place to wait.  People are stacked on top of each other or outside.  There are other Mexican restaurants and I think I'm going to find on.  I wish they would find a better location.",

It's not part of a chain, most likely a mom and pop (and grandma and grandpa) establishment that doesn't serve fast food, but good food fast.  Growing up, I didn't have the maturity to eat other cuisines. Having lived near the Mexican border years back, I had access to this incredible food made by people who took humble ingredients and made them taste great. Mexican isn't one of my favorite cuisines, but I appreciate it being available when I have that urge.  I originally wanted to get menudo, but it's only available on the weekends. Instead, I picked what I remember from the menu as \"goat soup\" or something. Braised goat meat in I believe is a tomato-based liquid.  Was a tasty meal, but I left looking like a crime scene happened on my clothing. Good thing I tend to wear darker hued clothes. Was going to order the quacamole, but thought against it, too much food for me to eat.  Will go again.",
