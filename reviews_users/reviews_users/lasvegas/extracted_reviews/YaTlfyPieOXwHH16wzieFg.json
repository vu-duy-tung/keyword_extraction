The only person who seems to always be on the ball is the cashier. Be prepared to have to explain multiple times what you want in your meal, and then watch them to make sure they do it right. Also if you order the taco special, I've been asked multiple times how many tacos I want ( the menu options are a one taco meal or a two taco meal...) but when I ask the guy behind the counter how many it comes with he said as many as I wanted and refused to give the correct answer even after insisting to know how many the meal CAME with. I've asked him this on three separate visits  ( same guy) to see if he will give the right answer and I always get the same answer. Its a good thing their food and drinks are great because it is a pain to have to supervise your own order being made!",

Pick up: Ordering pick up sucks. They make it as you come, not the pick up time. It took them 10 mins to make it. It beats waiting in line, but defeats the purpose of pick up.  Overall, I would not recommend this place. I'd rather eat at Roberto's",

    "text": "I'm in the customer service industry and am appalled at the service provided by Cafe Rio, specifically the Blue Diamond location 3 times in a row now.  3 week ago we placed an online order for my entire office (15 orders).  We placed the order over 1.5 hours prior to scheduled pick up.  There is no warning, nor notice online stating times may vary so we showed up about 10 minutes late and told the order still isn't ready.  Our employee that picked it up, on the payroll clock, had to wait another 45 minutes for it to be ready.  Luckily the did provide a 25% discount on our order.  By the time it got to the our office, 1 meal was missing and 2 were made incorrectly, so we had to send someone back (10 minute drive each way)...slightly ridiculous...but we get mistakes happen.  Our office ws upset by the situation above, but still love Cafe Rio and food so much we tried again.  My coworker ordered a single Chicken Salad yesterday online and showed up and it was ready on time.  She brought it back, it was completely wrong and no meat in her salad.  At this point, lunch is about over so we can't come back to pick it up.  TODAY .. I order 2 salads online for pick up at 1pm.  I show up at 1:15 and am told it's still another 15-20 minute wait.  I told them to cancel it and left.  After I left I called to speak with a manager (Friday 9/25/15 around 1:30pm) and was told there isn't a manager on duty to speak to me on the phone and then told she isn't accepting calls right now.  I get that it's a lunch rush, however, I'm an angry and upset customer and the manager should be available.  At this point, 3 times in a row, the meal wasn't ready within a 15 minute time frame with no warning and our orders continually get messed up.  The staff members making the take-out orders need to be more thorough and just pay attention to the orders.  It's not a difficult job and to follow directions.  One time I understand, but when it continually happens it becomes unacceptable.  I will no longer bring our business to the Blue Diamond location and notice I'm not the first one with terrible reviews on Yelp either.  I think this staff and management needs to have another few training sessions.",

We went tonight for dinner after not eating here for a couple of months because the service was so bad. The service tonight was even worse!  We walk in thinking we'll have our food in about 5ish minutes, as there were only about seven people in front of us and two were ready to pay. Fast forward over TWENTY minutes later, and our order was finally taken. They were understaffed, and the employees could have given two craps less about the job they were doing. Once we finally got our food, we couldn't even sit down because every table in the place was dirty even though there were only about three full tables in the entire restaurant! We had to clean one ourselves.   Not only was the service horrendous, but the food is only subpar at best now. The rice at this location is always cooked improperly now. How hard is it to cook rice?!?! Try taking a bite into half cooked rice and almost breaking your teeth on rice that is not cooked at all and hard as a rock. Not yummy, that's for sure. And tonight, my flour tortilla for my taco might as well have been a crunchy corn tortilla. It was as hard as a rock! It was terrible.  We are DONE with this Cafe Rio. Such a shame that they let it go so downhill.",

    "text": "I used to visit all the time but then started experiencing long lines and long waits. I then saw them cleaning the vents by standing with their sneakers on the chicken grill. I promised myself I would never return and a year later I broke that promise. Never again will I return. . I visited on Sunday August 21st at 530pm. I felt so bad for the staff.   I preordered my meal. When I arrived the cashier was on the phone calling her manager. I felt so bad for her as she was trying so hard. She should get a bonus. The conversation pretty much said the manager left, we have one person working the line, the dishwasher won't work the grill, and we are out of chicken, rice, steak, and salmon. She begged the manager to come to work to help and s/he was not being receptive about helping.   She then returned and told the line for pick up orders to join the main line as they only have one person working the prepline and it would be quicker.   I went in the prepline and ordered my meal. The lady was very nice and was trying to work fast. I give her loads of credit. Sadly I got the wrong order and burnt chicken when I opened my meal at home. Also I tried to use the app which had a B1G1 but told they can't honor it.   To the management team- you should support your staff and have a manager during prime operating hours. I heard the employee say that the manager had another job to go too. I feel bad for that manager but schedule someone else. You should not run out of food and have one employee working the line. They were obviously stressed.   I used to love this location but will go elsewhere.",

    "text": "This was the first time I had a bad experience at this location, but it was so frustrating!   I informed Associate #1 that I was ordering a salad. Before I could say anything else, he proceeded to throw a tortilla on the flattop with cheese. When he walked back, I had to inform him that I didn't want cheese. He just looks at me, then turns around, throws a container on the tortilla, and turns back around. Trying to be helpful, I asked my fiance what he was ordering and it was also a salad, so I told Associate #1 that he would take that tortilla. No response. Oookay. So I quickly tell him, \"I'm having a vegetarian salad\" before he could assume anything else. Also, since it was Thursday, there was a tamale meal special that I hadn't tried. I wanted to give them a whirl, so I asked Associate #1 if I could order one as a side item, since I didn't want the meal. He seemed confused and I asked a couple different ways, but he eventually answers, \"Yes.\"   Then, it's on to Associate #2. She seems nice enough, until I ask her a question, then she appears obviously annoyed. I say yes to all the vegetables, but no cheese. She asks me what type of dressing I want and as I'm attempting to formulate a sentence to indicate the dressing that is Vegan-friendly (I couldn't remember the name of either of them and she didn't tell me what they were, but just kept asking me which one I wanted), she starts scooping the creamy one into a cup. I'm like, \"Um, ah, uh, I meant the other one...the Vegan one???\" While trying to point through the glass. \"It's vinaigrette.\" Right. Then she just tosses it haphazardly to Associate #3, but it lands in the tortilla strips compartment. Nice.   While she's finishing up, I began to wonder where was my tamale?  Me: Um, I ordered a tamale in the side.... Associate #2: Did you tell him? (pointing at Associate #1) Me: Yes. Associate #2 to Associate #1: Did you get the tamale ready for her? Associate #1 has the look of \"Oh crap, I forgot\" on his face and gets it together. Associate #3 was great and asked if I wanted sides with the tamale (rice, beans, pico, and lettuce). Sure, why not. I also asked for no cheese.  Now, we are at the cashier. Cashier: Sure you don't want two tamales? It's the same price for one. Me: Uhh, what??? I asked the guy if I could order a tamale on the side and he said I could. Cashier: Oh. Weird. So you want the other one? Me: Um, okay...well, yeah. If I'm paying for it, I might as well.  We sit down and I'm pretty annoyed. I've barely started eating when the cashier walks over to bring us the tamale. Cashier: (as she is handing us the tray) Oh, did you want cheese on that? Me: (staring at the obvious, melted cheese on the tamale): Uhhhh... Cashier: If you don't want it, that's fine. We can make another one. Seriously, why would you bring it over with cheese on it and THEN ask me? Or better, why didn't anyone bother to ask Associate #1 or Associate #2 about how I had ordered the first tamale just a couple minutes prior?  So $25 and one (disgusting) tamale later, I didn't finish my food and Ieft feeling disappointed and dissatisfied (really, two tamales and two salads for $25 with bad service, no thank you). Additionally, for a salad I typically love, I had absolutely no desire to eat it tonight nor will I want to again in the future. For an establishment that has the appearance of promoting Vegetarian and Vegan options, it seems to be a bother to every associate to request NO cheese melted on the tortilla and NO cojita cheese (and cilantro, which Associate #2 also didn't bother to ask me if I wanted or not) topping my salad. If I hadn't received such amazing service in the past where associates have asked me whether or not I wanted certain items or concerned themselves with what I want on my meal, then this experience wouldn't have stood out so much.",

I've been to other cafe rio locations before, and had to wait maybe 15-20mins which for me although not ideal is something I can deal with without crying like a spoiled baby. The thing I can't deal with is not the longer wait time which at this location was closer to 30mins (I've gotten on rides at Disneyland quicker) but the careless attitude of the staff in the preparation of the food, the clear as day feckless attitude towards customers which includes talking to other staff members about inappropriate behavior they had participated in the previous night, and an apparent lack of any leadership.   Might I add that I am in no way prudish, I myself enjoy inappropriate behavior but while I'm at work I keep it to myself or I wait till patrons who could take offense are far from earshot.   I will not be returning to this location.  I doubt I will even go to any other locations.  There is clearly a lack of giving a fuck from whomever manages this particular location, but more so I lay blame on the corporate end, business must indeed be good because they seem to be completely fine losing customers.",

[SERVICE] They don't explain anything on the menu for instance they'll ask if you wanted your burrito enchilada style but not willing to explain what that means. Your just supposed to know apparently. Also they didn't mention guacamole is additional. Found out at the register it was $1.25 extra which was no problem but they should have mentioned it.

I called in my order & was given a 20 min pick up time, I get there 30 min later order wasn't even started on. Manager says \"O sorry we are out of rice did they not tell you\" meanwhile I had already been sitting waiting for almost 20 more minutes. To top it OFF when they FINALLY had my order ready it wasn't even Right! I don't know if there's new management at this location but it keeps getting worse as time goes on!",

My mouth is watering as I write this review thinking about the delicious sweet pork. They have lunch specials that change with the day of the week. I believe Tuesdays are coconut shrimp taco day, and those are by far my favorite lunch special. I always get a side of their creamy tomatillo dressing to dip my tacos in! Try it! The only reason I'm knocking off a star is for their slow lunch service. It takes 20 - 25 minutes sometimes to get thru the lunch line!",

Let me start of by saying I'm not normally a fan of barbacoa but everyone kept telling me how great theirs was and I've got to say it was the best, most filling, flavorful salad I've had in a LONG time. They also create the salad on top of a fresh, warm, flour tortilla so that when you're finished eating the leafy portion of the salad so have a burrito to complete your meal. Aside from the delicious meal the prices were very reasonable, the portions were perfect, and the staff was comedic, friendly, and delightful to be around. I will definately be visiting Cafe Rio again.",

Amazingly, everyone working there was a good actor or actually enjoys their job. The only negative was I hate seeing all those tinfoil pans going in the trash. They should get real pie pans and wash them. On my wish list I wish they had margaritas.",

The girl working the first station taking your order messed mine up which I didn't realize until the very end (quesadilla v. Kids quesadilla), she was basically slopping the sauces and meat around on the other orders I saw her make. Also, her gloves were dripping with sauces but she still didn't change them and instead shook her hand and then wiped them on a dirty looking towel, and kept handling other people's meat/cheese/tortilla. The line was extremely slow and I'm not sure the person working it even had knowledge of what was supposed to go in to my tortilla soup. At checkout the cashier said they'd remake the quesadilla which is fine but then brought us the to go container with a piece of meat hanging out of the lid and juice dripping down the side. Very disappointing.",

    "text": "Let me just start with the Cafe Rio on Eastern is the best with the nicest employees.  The last two times that I have been to the Blue Diamond location I have had a horrible experience.  The first time the cashier was extremely rude to me, she was unhappy that I was paying with my Cafe Rio points from my catering order. That is no reason to be rude to anyone. No thank you, no nothing. This is your job, if she is so unhappy she should just quit.  The second time I stopped in I was close to this location so I decided to stop in during the lunch hour. It was a little busy but I was patient. I ordered a salad and I told the person no Pico, and I had to yell it over the glass and she was still was not listening to me because I had to say it numerous times. When she finally heard me it was too late and she he started to scoop off the Pico, then looked at me and in a very rude manner she asked \"do you want me to make you another?\" She was so rude but I said no, that's okay. She obviously did not want to. I checked out and I was so surprised that she was so rude, when it was her fault that she wasn't listening to what I wanted. She should have just made me another without asking. I headed back to the office to eat my salad, I picked the remaining tomatoes out and to my surprise I found a BUG on my lettuce.  Well I wasn't going to eat the salad now that it had a bug in it. That was the last time that I will ever go to this location. This one is close to my house, and close to my job but I am willing to drive all the way to Eastern if I want Cafe Rio.",

Priorities and responsibilities are clearly not explained or followed up with in this restaurant. People are in line for upwards of 30-40 minutes, the customer is definitely not the priority at this location. The lack of detail in visible service is clearly lacking but the scary part all the aspects that a customer can't see. Figure it out corporate and get someone to manage this better.",

One time they pissed me off like never before. The cashier gave me so much attitude, they kept messing up my order, and when I got home there was hair in my food!! (I called back, spoke to the manager, and got a free burrito the next time I came, but like I was angry, tired and starving when I got home and couldn't even eat my food)  Anyways they've gotten better with their service it's mediocre, and the food is still the same.

The meal came with a soda and the one I chose was flat. Yuck.  This place is usually pretty busy and that fast paced atmosphere is not for me. I'm not in a race to get my burrito, for Pete's sake.

    "text": "This place is pretty amazing. This girl must have been the manager or something because she had people moving around in this restaurant getting stuff done. So from a previous cafe Rio experience (like last week) I placed an order on line went to pick it up a half hr early or at least make sure it would be ready by my pick up time and give me some time to eat my lunch before taking lunch to my customer. Ling store short my order was not ready when I got there and it was not ready when I asked for it to be ready so thinking this restaurant might be the same i showed up to this one 15mins early and again my order was not ready but it was not because they were behind it was because the printer was not printing the on-line orders.  So the amazing part here is i had 5 meals and they got them ready two mins before by 11am pick-up. They were fast. This girl working this location needs to go over to the other location i was last week and get them in order.",

She went the extra mile with asking me what I wanted on my burrito and being specific about the cheese, you can just tell she cared. I've been to this location a few times & I've never had someone take care of me like Destiny has. It surprised me so much I had to write a review. Thank you destiny !",

She looked at me like I told her she had a wart on her nose. I got my meal and went to get a soda and there was no ice, no lemonade & the place looked dirty like it needed to be swept and the trash around the soda station needed picked up. It always amazes me when there's employees standing around doing nothing when there's obvious work to be done. Disappointed.",

The girl that helped us was so rude but I felt like she was mad cause she was the only one doing everything (still not a reason to be mad at us). Then our food sat there for like 3 minutes until I asked the kid stocking if someone was going to finish our food he said \"oh yea he will in a bit\"...um ok. Then we ordered chips and guacamole and the two girls were both struggling to get chips...it was seriously so irritating watching a bunch of employees and only the rude one working.

Where in the world did that one come from considering the fact that beans and rice in lieu of a protein is listed as an option on the GINORMOUS MENU PLACCARD POSTED ON THE WALL?!? When I mentioned to her that she was incorrect because I always order the same thing, she totally copped an attitude with me which I thought was completely uncalled for and inappropriate. I hope corporate can take notice and rectify this situation soon because I really enjoyed their food. Until then, won't be coming back.",

By far the best tasting pork I have ever eaten in my 43 years. Cafe Rio has a new loyal fan. In addition, the fresh tortillas were out of this world as well. Over the weekend I brought some home for my wife to try who loved it just as much.    Wow.  This place is food gold.  Awesome.  If you have not been, you have to go!",

Yesterday, we spent 25 min in line (not a long line), then all of the iced tea canisters were out, so I had to go back to let someone know. Food was good. When we left, I went back to get some iced tea that should be ready, but then there was no ice and the tea was too dilute. So much for the drink I paid for. There was a large puddle of standing water in front of the ice machine with no warning sign and nobody attending to it (potential lawsuit right there if someone got hurt). The garbage was overflowing, literally.  This has always been a great restaurant with its convenient location and large seating area, but the work ethic of the workers is what brings it down. There are a few hard workers, so I don't want to put them down, but the overall feel is of sluggish employees that DON'T CARE. People move at a snail's pace and seem completely oblivious to the aggravation that one feels by the time you actually get to the clueless cashier who doesn't care either.",

Wife and I decided to pick up some food from the Blue Diamond location because our new favourite for \"quick and honest\" Mexican fare, Phat Phranks, is closed on weekends.  As I watched them build my burritos my heart sank and I knew I wasn't going to be in for a pleasant experience. The meat was wet, beans were swimming in goo and the tortillas split from the wetness as they wrapped it. My wife's bean and cheese burrito was even worse - 48.5% rice, 48.5% wet beans, 1% of a tiny sprinkle of cheese.  When we went to eat our meals the burritos were predictably soggy, vaguely unpleasant tasting -- revolting beans -- and generally yucky. I found it just edible and would rate the place 1 and a half stars overall, rounding down because it's a bit overpriced and I just didn't enjoy the taste.",

Not a one time problem, every time, it takes this location 3-4 times as long to clear a line than any other location I've visited.  If you ever do get your food, it should be pretty good... But that's a big if.",

Every employee is running around like chickens with their heads cut off. I don't know how they can keep track of whose order is whose; I can't even follow my own plate. My food is always very wet and messy from not draining the meat juice which makes it harder to eat and enjoy. I don't know if every location is like this, but I now dislike all Cafe Rios. This restaurant would be much better off as a sit down place with waiters. That way I would expect a 30 minute wait for my food, instead of standing in line for it.",

Mild but it has a lot of flavor. For a good and okay place, come here. Try the steak burrito & mint lime drink!!!! My 5 year got a free cheese \"Nino quesadilla\". This is on my side of town and I thought it was okay. Nice atmosphere.... For a fast food type of place!!",

I placed my order before hand, told the young lady over the phone that I wanted red sauce and a chili relleno with no meat, 4 times! I also stated I wanted a side of the medium sante fe green chili sauce. Well guess what, it was wrong. When we got to the restaurant, she stated that the chili rellenos only came one way and she stated, \"I was going to call you but I didn't\" so we then ordered cheese enchiladas instead of the chili rellenos with RED sauce. Mind you again, I ordered red and said cheese multiple times. We get home open up the containers, the enchiladas were not red sauce, they were green, again I ordered them with red sauce. The sauce I ordered in the side was supposed to be sante fe medium sauce, it was tomatillo. Called in, the managers response was oh she's not familiar with the sauces. Not familiar with the sauces? She works at Cafe Rio! I then go to eat the enchiladas and they have chicken in them. If they only serve items with meat, they need to tell customers. I called back again, the manager still acted like it was no big deal and didn't care. Customer service means a lot to me and the fact that you can't take care of customers, is total incompetence!",

I'm vegetarian, so I have no opinion on the meats. I tried it three different times to give it a fair shot. First time I got black bean tacos, fail. Second time I got cheese enchiladas, fail. Third time I got a vegetarian salad, fail (and they put enough lettuce on top to feed an army of rabbits. I guess lettuce is WAY cheaper than cheese). I will go out of my way to drive the extra miles to a place that cooks the food properly and has some flavor. Won't be going here again.",

I've decided to just let it go everytime I come in, because the food is somewhat decent. After today, I decided that it's time I write a review. I'm always greeted with a major attitude when I pay for my food here. And as another yelper said, the drink machines are always empty, and the staff is too lazy to refill them. If you insist, they emphasize the fact that it will \"take a long time\". Even if I say I'll wait, they have an attitude about  it. One of the main reasons I go to Cafe Rio is for their delicious drinks, but now I will no longer be coming to this location, even though it's pretty close to my house. I rather drive extra miles, and be treated in a professional manner. I hope whoever manages this location reads all the negative reviews, and implements some changes.",

    "text": "True fact. Since I discovered Cafe Rio, probably 95% of the burritos I've eaten have come from here.  They make Mission-style burritos here, with savory beans, cilantro lime rice (that is inexplicably beige), sauce and cheese on the inside along with your meat of choice, and lettuce and pico next to it in an aluminum tray. I almost always get the shredded, braised chicken and the hot red sauce. Unlike Chipotle's rubbery, greasy meat, the chicken and roast chile beef here are flavorful without overpowering the other flavors in the burrito. The aroma of the red sauce is intoxicating.  They run the burritos through a conveyor oven and then add veggies - a \"why didn't anyone think of it sooner\" innovation that keeps hot stuff hot and cold stuff cold. Hey, remember the McDLT? Nah, me neither.  Though the salsa fresca served here isn't anything special, their \"wall of flame\" covered in hot sauces is a great way to add heat and flavor.  Honestly? The best part of this burrito is the tortilla. Made fresh moments before you order, it's dense and mild and almost more reminiscent of a naan in some bites.  Service is generally very good here, and the staff definitely seems to have a cordial rapport with their guests. Some of the quirky chants I could do without, but it makes the place livelier than your usual burrito assembly line.  Me gusta.",

Needless to say, it took them some time to correct it and my food grew cold even after i told them this would happen. Not even an apology or acknowledgement of my issue. Well, it came to fruition and when i finally sat down, my food was cold, the chicken was dry and just not very enjoyable and my brother had it worse as he was behind me in line.

A girl takes my order and I thought it was odd she never ask a name and hangs up. Then I get there.. Lobby is empty and trash is full with NO CUSTOMERS. Walk up to the counter and the guy that makes the food starts YELLING (not walking to the back) towards the back for the cashier to come to front.  So, I tell them I have a Togo order. He says there is no Togo order.. so I order a steak burrito. The guy (30ish white guy) yells at cashier \"THERE IS NO STEAK\" so cashier turns to me and tells me what I just heard.. so I order a chicken quesadilla. Please drain the meat.. guy hears cashier tell him to drain meat.. he doesn't and tosses soggy chicken onto grill and tortilla. They make up the quesadilla and then tell me there is no guacamole after I ask for quac. That's not the bad part. I joke and say I just heard a commercial about how guacamole is always fresh and make daily.. they joke and say sorry it's been busy and we didn't make anymore steak or quac. Like I'm a moron for asking... so. To top it off the girl who I assume took my order comes walking in like no big deal and with a bunch of loud friends. Then I bump into the pile of trash on the way out piled on top of the trash can and it falls on the ground. No big deal... hope this place gets better.

The guy seemed extremely slow when I kept telling him I had already paid/was very frustrating. I also don't recommend getting the salmon because they don't take the whole grilled salmon they chop it up and then they put it inside and mix in the salad which I think is very in appropriate. Some people like their salmon right on top which is what I prefer. The lettuce is not fresh mixed greens isn't like a very finely chopped iceberg. If you want quick whatever Mexican food sure then go for it. But I don't think I'll be coming back there's a lot better options to go to",

We weren't in a huge hurry, but they seem a little disorganized at this location. It took several people to handle our checkout and when they said my mom's bowl wasn't ready because the chicken was still cooking and would take another 15 minutes, they offered us a different protein. Since we didn't want the rest of the food to be sitting out while we waited for the grilled chicken she changed to shredded chicken. It was only after we decided that did we realize they hadn't even made the rest of the food yet, so there was really no need to change the order.

They were not busy at all, yet when we walked up to the line to give our order, we were never greeted or acknowledged...just flat out ignored by the crew.  In fact, my husband and I looked down at the assembly line and it was disgusting! The food was all over the place and dried up on the counters. It looked like someone had a food fight and never bothered to clean up all day. I have never seen anything like it, so disappointed.  Where is Management,  who let's employees do this? Needless to say, we left immediately after that. I'd rather go hungry. I never write reviews, but this had to be shared.",

To top it off the Dr. Pepper was disgusting and super watered down. I can only hope the food tastes ok, as that's the only reason I go to this location. It's close and for the expected food. As for the quality of service, it blows my mind how bad it is.",

I proceeded to walk around the mopped floors to not place footprints on the employees efforts and they tell me they are out of all rice, grilled chicken, salmon, and basically everything I was hoping to order. I ordered what was left while staff continued to try and put things away quickly, even turning off the drink machines to which people were ordering. Then, when I bit into my order, I noticed a bunch of gunk on my tacos that looked like scraped dirty burnt surface of the grill. Staff seemed irritated that people were walking in to order and perhaps they added the dirty crap to customers food to get revenge for us doing such a horrible thing as trying to order fast food, 40 minutes before posted closing time. Had I known they had a desire to close up shop prior to me arriving, I would have gladly gone somewhere else. Even next door to Habit Burger. You can tell that Management here has its own set of rules and policies, regardless of what their corporate policy is. So all in all, I got a rude welcome, food I didn't want to order because they were \"out\", weird gross crap on that food, and no drink access that I wanted. 1 star restaurant, for real...",

    "text": "The food here is standard Cafe Rio fare -- bland, fresh, and high quality -- but the one star rating is deserved because this restaurant CAN NOT handle any type of crowd. The lines here are outrageous and I agree with the other recent reviews. PLEASE, corporate, PAY ATTENTION AND DO SOMETHING ABOUT THIS LOCATION!  It wasn't always like this. Cafe Rio was a quick and easy place to grab a business lunch or to get takeout on the way home from a long day at work. No longer. After my most recent visit 2 nights ago (and a nearly 45 minute wait in line at 8 pm!!), I will now not only actively avoid dining here, but I will be sure to spread the word to everyone I know.   People are not exaggerating about the wait times. The problem is, you never know just how long the queue will take when you line up. The employees are so slow and nobody tries to expedite the line. Cafe Rio is supposed to be a \"quick service\" restaurant but now it's anything but.   There's no excuse. Zero. Zip. None.   All I can figure is that Cafe Rio corporate and this location's manager just don't give a crap about losing customers.   We used to go at least twice a week. Then that whittled down to once a week, then a couple of times a month then about once a month. Now it's gone to none.   Maybe that's your plan, to get people to stop coming to your restaurant so the line will move quicker. Congrats, Cafe Rio! Here's to at least two other people (as well as all of our friends and coworkers) who will never set foot in your restaurant again.",

Seeing how I wasn't a fan of that style of restaurant I was hesitant to go...but hey...it was free (mom was buying) and it didn't break my no eating out challenge (again...mom was buying).   We roll in...monkeys in tow...and notice how festive and colorful this place was. Very nice for kids. I ordered one of each of the special tacos (mahi-mahi and spicy crispy shrimp), rice and beans, and a drink. We also shared the chips and queso. Holy cow! The tacos had fresh made tortillas, creamy tomatillo dressing (think tomatillo ranch), huge pieces of cilantro and generous portions of meat. The drink bar was amazing. Not only did they have Diet Dr. Pepper and orange soda (my favorite)....they have fresh mint limeade! It was so freaking tasty. My kids had 2 cups each (and lots of potty trips after).   I pounded down my food like it was my last meal (super lady like). It was like Heaven and I now am a fan of the designer burrito concept again. Thank you Cafe Rio.   PS: Don't tell them its your first time eating there...they will break out into song.",

As you're waiting you can see the employees making tortillas and other goodies.  I place my order of the Pork Burrito, and it was incredible.  Great portion and kept warm all the way back home.

Once there was a sharp chicken bone in a shredded chicken salad I ordered.  They always give us the wrong dressing, or add beans to our order when we specifically ask for it to be left out.  I also prefer shredded lettuce, and I only get it if I stand in line to put the order in.  I understand they are busy, but it's just unacceptable customer service to have it happen over and over again.  I have even contacted corporate, and the issues have not been addressed.

The shift manager's (Stephanie) attitude showed she hated her job! She was the 2nd person on the line that adds lettuce, pico, etc. She wasn't listening to what me & my husband was telling her. She had no care in the world how she was treating everyone's food. Very sloppy.   2. Food quality - THUMBS DOWN! They served dead lettuce. I ordered the tamales and the guy served me a crumbled - into pieces- broken tamales. If my husband didn't ask for a new one, he would of just sold it to me like that. It broke into pieces because it was DRY.   AND THEY CAN OUT OF PICO AT 7:30 PM - during a busy dinner service! OMG!  What a shame! This location needs revamping in their food quality and their attitudes. We won't be going to this location ever.",

It's horrible. Not by all employees but most. At one point every time I came and picked up my food my order was always wrong. The employee in the food line never properly greets you. They look miserable. I have heard many times in standing in the line about similar issues from other people. I have even called this store a few times to tell a manager about how I found bones in my chicken and how my order was once again wrong. I also noticed each time I come I owe a new amount of money. I get the SAME exact thing every time. So I saved 6 recipes and yep prices ranged from $6-$22 nuts.  Also depending on who's working you will get a stamp on your stamp card. Then when I question why I don't get a stamp I get a rude response and told to have a great day.  Anyways I never write these things but I'm completely frustrated and sadly prob won't be coming back to this location.",

Every single time I attempt to try again thinking that the last time was a fluke and someone was having a bad day or something but every time I come back it gets worse. When arriving up to the counter to order they were clearly rushing us through, the guy ahead of me was very frustrated as the girl asked numerous times why he ordered and what he wanted on it because she wasn't paying attention she was flirting and holding a conversation with the other worker. The guy taking the orders by the tortillas said \"ma'am what do you want?\" So I asked for what I wanted and he didn't take time to ask if I wanted anything else before he asked the girl behind me what she wanted, so I had to rudely interrupt and say I actually have two more meals I would like to get, he then rolls his eyes and rushes through my order. Fast forward to the payment, I was charged for an extra pork salad so she then they only Gave me one of the two pork salads.. then I went to fill up my drink and one of the workers was cleaning the floor under the drink station so I waited holding my cup for Him to finish and 3-4 minutes go by and he's looked at me knows I'm waiting on him so I said excuse me can i get a drink and he said ya go ahead, and didn't move at all so I had to reach over him. This was all just one visit... other visits I've been skipped for my order being taken, my pork salads have had rocks in them, it's just terrible when it comes to customer service at this location. I'm very disappointed in the staff here. I will Not be coming back.",

Last week my salad container was wiped with a very dirty wash rag, one that was used to clean their line and maybe the deep fryer. It looked freaking horrific. I informed the manager and she had my food re-made. The person who made it never washed her hands, did not change gloves, and needs to be re-trained. Today I stopped in to see if things were different.  Sad to say they are not. Service took 30 minutes. I had to constantly ask for their attention. Nobody listened. It's abysmal. Then on my way out the girl bringing back the garbage can was wearing gloves, but touches the door handle, and goes straight to organizing the forks and spoons. Why has the state not investigated? I ate 4-5 meals a week here. I ate at Cafe Rio when I was a medic in Salt Lake City. This place is a hole and needs to be addressed l.

I would have gotten the three tacos with fire-grilled steak... except they were out of fire-grilled steak.  The person who ordered in front of me got fire-grilled steak... so I guess he got the last of it.  It was around 6pm on a Wednesday, so I'm not quite sure what that is about.    Anyway, I ended up ordering a pork barbacoa taco and a chicken taco.  The barbacoa taco was fantastic... but super messy and just kept dripping all over the place.  However, I can handle a mess when the taco is this good.  Unfortunately, I can't really say the same for the chicken taco... but I did see that they offer an upgraded chicken, so I guess I must have ordered the chicken that they know is not their best chicken.  Strange thinking there.  The chips were out of a bag, but the queso was pretty good.  It had a little bit of a canned (or bagged) cheese taste, but the added peppers, onions, etc. made it pretty good.  I will give this place another shot when I'm back in Vegas, but only after checking out all of the other options.",

Fourth lady asked what I'm having, I repeated and she cashed me out. All four women seemed confused and tired of working so hard.

No name tags so who knows there names. Everyone else seemed to move at a snails pace and not give a crap. First there were two phoned in/emailed orders that were large and being placed ahead of ours. So we literally stood at the window watching our food just sit there for close to 10 minutes. They need to get a quicker system or give customers that are actually there priority.  Don't let the food just sit. Second, I was able to see a lot going on while I had to just stand waiting. An order of nachos had sour cream on it and they didn't want anything on it apparently,  and you would think it was a good thing they caught a mistake before it went out. However the person that seemed to be in charge, pony tail and glasses, told the larger gal with curly hair to just scrape it off. So she did just that, and then covered up what she couldn't get off with more cheese, the proceeded to run back thru to melt. Hope there aren't any severe allergies that can cause someone to be really ill...all because your lazy and didn't do it right the first time. Then, while we are still waiting in the same spot at the end of the line just staring at our food sitting, a burrito fell off of the oven conveyor because another one came thru. But here's the thing, the second item didn't come thru and push it right off, it happened over a matter of minutes. And then when it fell, the sour cream gal announced it in a very \"oh well\" tone and NO ONE cared. It just sat on the floor. And sat. And sat... After the other orders were finally done, the cashier acknowledged us though we'd been standing there for somentime staring at her and everyone else at the end of the production line. And when she did get around to acknowledging us she said \"give me a minute\". Wow. You know how long we've been standing here, and all we've just seen and you speak to me like I'm bugging you. I also asked her for a side of beans and I thought her head was going to quiet literally explode from the audacity of my request. She was so put out by it.  Look, I didn't say anything because I was exhausted and only there because I didn't have the energy to cook for the family. And I knew that if I said something these people would have defended their crappy behavior because the one in charge was the same way. They just absolutely do NOT give a crap. About anything. I won't be going back because unfortunately this isn't the first time we've had to deal with this place clearly having poor management. Which is a shame, because there are some good people that are trying to do a good job, even if that kind of thing isn't encouraged.",

I was disappointed at this location, I feel like a lot of the employees do not care to be there and therefore have crappy service, they also don't have he fun atmosphere anymore, I remember the first time I went to Cafe rio they were always singing and yelling free meal or happy birthday or whatever, it seemed fun, this time it was like an assembly line and I even heard an employee complain that he doesn't get paid enough. They had run out of a few drinks on the fountain which I think is unacceptable for a restaurant as busy as they are, and then my food, my burrito had a whole Bullion inside of it it it was so salty I could no longer eat it. They did fix it by giving me another burrito. But I feel like this location needs more attention especially as busy as it is. The bathroom was also very dirty.",

You are clearly just part of the herd getting pushed through the line. The employees take no pride in keeping the restaurant clean or servicing their equipment-check out the drink machine that's been down for the past month. If you must eat Cafe Rio try one of the other locations-it will be worth the extra drive.",

I honestly felt the food wasn't that great at all. Chipotle taste way better. Even Roberto's is better food. This is like fake Mexican food. Maybe it was the location? but we will not be coming back to have dinner at  this place again.",

There hasn't been a time yet that I go there and it is slow, that says something!  The pork nachos are one of the best things!! I recommend sharing them!!

The last 5 times I visited location they were out of items at 7pm that they should not be such as corn tortillas, orchata, and tres leche desert to name a few.  So very disappointing.  Today however, my kids were disappointed as the rice they love was hard.  As we headed to the drink area I noticed the specialty drinks were AGAIN off.  I asked for assistance as orchata was the drink we wanted, the manager said she could make some which was nice, however in the mist of her making fresh orchata, another customer was redeeming his stamp card and the cashier was arguing with him about how many stamps he has and who can use his card(his friend with him apparently not allowed to use his card )loudly in front of my children.  As we waited for another 8 mins...finally I interrupted and asked for my drink, which was given and a free meal next visit...so overall experience again was disappointing, manager handled the other guy and myself accordingly, but the workers there seem very unhappy and unwilling to value returning customers.  This is the only location that seems to have these types of issues.  hopefully they turn around the customer service and have menu items in stock. #wheresthecustomerservicegone? #ijustwantcaferioback",

That is what kept me coming back for quite some time. However, the negatives far outweigh the good at this point. First, the line is always horrendous. I'm not sure why this hasn't been addressed by management or corporate. Something is clearly wrong with the organization and the method in which they are preparing the food if the line is constantly backed-up. Second, the attitude of the workers is, generally speaking, horrible. They roll their eyes, reach over/breathe on the food, and they don't want to listen to the customer if he or she wants specific items on his/her salad. I'm not sure what the point of the employee building the salad is if they aren't very welcoming to the fact that I only want specific items on it. They act as though it's a huge hardship to put anything other than the generic \"everything\" on my salad. I hope people continue to gripe about the line and the service, because I think Cafe Rio is very profitable and this allows Corporate or Management to turn a blind eye (or they are just unaware). Good food, bad service. Count me out for good.",

I order a salad with extra steak and charged me $3.00 for extra steak sign states $1.50 not $3.00 steak was very much over cooked and not worth the $1.50 or $3.00 and extra cilantro. I always get an extra house dressing on the side ( one is never enough) lol. The last time I ordered my salad they where cooking fresh tortillas but when I ordered they tried to give me an old one that had be sitting around for some time. I didn't mind waiting. I asked for shredded lettuce for my salad and extra cilantro. Ordered 2 house dressings and A side of guacamole. The order was to go. I got home to find out guacamole was not on my salad like it's been for years. I was not happy at this point and called the number on the receipt. The air head on the phone said did you ask for it on the side I said yes. Then she explains to me that there have be a few changes to the sides and what comes with everything. When I walked in I seen new menu signs but not new side item that cost extra. This use to be my favorite place to eat but not anymore. The lady on the phone didn't even want to make me happy (like next time you come in we will fix it) she didn't want to be bothered with anything. You keep getting bad reviews everyone will need to find a new job. Very unhappy and I didn't deserve the attitude on the phone like she was to busy to talk to me and was rushing to get off the phone with me. Sorry but that's not good customer service I expect from a place like Cafe Rio. I won't be going back so you just lost a very loyal customer over young kids that don't care about customer service. It's very sad that I had to experience it. New rules should be clearly posted for everyone to see not just to the employee's to see. Very disappointed and will be telling my friends about it as well. Too bad I couldn't rate you zero stars because 1 is to much.",

    "text": "Hate to do this to a company I use to really enjoy but this one star rating has been my normal experience at this location. Wife had a pretty bad day and wanted to get a salad with steak from here. Was a bit surprised to see the place nearly empty (1 person in line and 2 couples eating), but now know why. I stood in line for a bit before finally beginning to time how long it would take for one of the 7 employees to even say hello, let alone take my order.   I did not see one employee with a smile and most seemed like they just did not want to be there. It took nearly 15 minutes to take my order with seven employees! The person in front of me was already paying by the time I reached the front of the line. After ordering, I went to get our drinks, only to find that the Horchata and the mint-lemonade were heavily watered down. Think of water with a slice of lemon. Had we dined in, i would have caught the flavorless drinks and got a refund.   Will not return and will be sure to let others know not to waste their time or money here.",

Although it's meant to be a fast-casual dining experience, there is nothing fast about it. 3 Visits = 90 Minutes of standing in line... also, don't plan on being able to use your rewards here. This location doesn't have a scanner to use for rewards. Bottom line, if you come here you'll have long waits, very average service, and no return on your spending (no rewards).",

I walked in today, the employees working behind the window looked upset and unhappy ( um, you chose this job, right?). There was no guac and steak available at 3:30 in the afternoon. Ok, I get it. But I do not think the employee should have an attitude when I say I will wait for it to be made. It actually took management an hour to make more guac and steak.  Needless to say, it was a huge disappointment. I will not be returning to this particular establishment again. It is too bad that it has become such a crappy place.",

Setting the stage with me and 3 colleagues waiting in line:  Colleague 1:  I'd like a beef burrito Loud guy behind counter:  We don't have beef!  We have steak! Colleague 1:  Okay..steak.  Corn tortilla please Loud guy behind counter:  Steak burrito!  Beans? Colleague 1:  Yes, black beans.  Corn tortilla please Loud guy:  Hot or mild? Colleague 1:  I'll have that one (points), the fresh salsa Loud guy:  That's pico de gallo! Collague 1:  Okay..that (by the way...he ended up with a flour tortilla anyway)  Loud guy:  NEXT!  (extra loud as if I'm not standing 29 inches in front of him) Me:  Can I have salmon in a burrito? Loud guy:  YES!  We have salmon! Me:  Okay...salmon burrito please Loud guy:  salmon-ay por favor!  (I'm pretty sure Spanish for salmon is salmon...no \"ay\") Loud guy:  BEANS?!!!!! Me:  yes, white please Loud guy:  WE DON'T HAVE WHITE BEANS, WE HAVE Me, interrupting loud guy:  PINTO BEANS! (and I pronounced it PEEN-toe in my best Spanish accent) Loud guy:  Hot or mild (now not as loud) Me:  Salsa roja and pico de gallo Loud guy:  wet style right?  (then just pours enchilada sauce on before I answer) Me:  Sure (as if I have a choice at this point)  By then, I think he was annoyed with me and just sent my burrito down to the next gal to add lettuce, sour cream and rice.  Look...I get it that some of us come from culturally diverse backgrounds and enjoy bringing the heritage to the workplace where it's appropriate.  But c'mon dude... Caucasians in the Southwest typically understand the ingredient list at Latin cuisine establishments.  I like Cafe Rio, but I think I'll pass on this one next time and get a sub sandwich where they don't care if you ask for yellow peppers, banana peppers, hot peppers, or just point.  They get it.

I was probably 10th in line and was waiting a good 30 minutes in line, several times I told myself just leave other times I said I want to know what the hype was about. Finally get up there and I order the barbacoa burrito enchilada style. I'm skiing the guy how do I order because this is my first time here, let's just say he rolled his eyes and was annoyed I was asking questions. The food looked great. I sat down a dug in my burrito. It was the most disgusting  burrito I ever had, it tasted like I put a spoon full of sugar in my mouth. Last time I checked Mexican meat doesn't taste like that. I'll never come back again. I'll stick to authentic Mexican food/restaurants",

Proceed to wait inline and order food. There was only 1 person in front of us yet it took forever to get our food! The burrito maker kid messed up the burrito for the person in front of us 2 times so he had to remake it over and over. Then when it came to my turn i ordered a grilled chicken burrito basic toppings. He places it in the conveyor heater and proceeds to finish the 1st customers order. My burrito goes through the conveyor and comes out and just sits there...what was the point of heating it up if it get cold sitting there?? Finally the customer in front finishes. I get my burrito and order a side of chips+salsa. Again i wait for the guy to go in the back to get more chips.   So i finally sit down to eat my burrito. Its not good at all. Its not even hot. The chicken tastes like the Tyson brand frozen stuff you get at the supermarket. The rice had no flavor, it was basically a tasteless burrito. The only thing that was good was the salsa for the chips. I really didnt see the hype for this place. Chipotle is 10x better and the chicken taste like chicken! definitely would not eat here ever again. id rather get a hotdog from 7-11",

They tend to be rude as if though this is their first time working customer service or they just dont care.  They lack management and it reflects on the poor service. I most likely will not come back the food isnt that great to endure rude service. They should really look into who they hire or whom ever is training cause someone isnt doing their job and it reflects..But onthe plus side they offer free child quesadilla for kids under 6. So yah to free stuff.....oh and they should make it a habit to refill their drinks when they are empty, been here three time and I swear the horchata and mint tea where empty....",

Well every time I come in they did it without asking. So she should have asked how I want it. Then she rolled her eyes at one of her coworkers at something they did. It took about 35 mins to get through the line of about 13 people in front of me. Nobody was welcoming or friendly. The location on Durango is so much better.

My friends and family wanted to go out to have a fun and cost effective meal for dinner and since this was one of our friends favorite places we decided to give it a shot.   Wow, we were in for a surprise. We waited in a long line to finally get to the counter where we were rudely greeted with what do you want! Yep that's what she said we placed our order of 2 pork nachos and 1 pork salad and 1 grilled chicken salad. Then we were quickly rushed to the next rude lady that really pushed the customer service line to a new low she holds our salad and stares at us for about a minute and then says \" ok so what is that you want I don't have all day\" I couldn't believe it  Since this was our first time visiting this place I didn't really know it was like a subway where you pick your toppings! Sorry we are rookies!!   I tell her we will take everything on it then she glares at us and pretty much just slops everything on there and looks up and says ok now what kind of dressing. We say um what are our options?   What happens next I could not even explain in words that will justify her actions. She snarled at us dropped our plate on the counter and grabbed the next one in line to ours which so happened to be our nachos!! She looks at the other customer in line and asks them \" what do you want on the nachos\"   Her face was priceless when the dude told her that those are not his!! She looks back at us and realizing that the next four plates are ours!! Decides to then be somewhat helpful.   We finally make it to the register and even the person ringing us up says sorry about that is there anything else I can help you with!!   Overall it was a terrible experience and over priced food. I don't know how there pork won awards as in my opinion it wasn't all that great and the customer service made this place terrible.   The nachos were ok, I have had better at taco bell! There signature salad plate is a great idea and wasn't terrible but poorly executed. I would never recommend this place and I can find a better place to spend $45 bucks for dinner.",

    "text": "I finally gave this place a try, and while I haven't quite made up my mind about it, I will say this: the food is good.  I didn't love my experience here, to be honest. The food is terribly overpriced, about 9 dollars and change if you set your burrito up with everything chipotle offers at around $8.  That wouldn't be so bad, but the lady making my burrito rolled it up long before I was done telling her what I wanted on it. I guess they put their pico de gallo, lettuce and other veggies on the side, which is ok but I would have liked the choice to have it in my burrito.  With only meat, beans, cheese, salsa, and a little rice inside, the burrito was near impossible to pick up without collapsing and spilling out large amounts of messy filling. I'd recommend ordering your burrito enchilada style with sauce and cheese on top since you will be eating it with a fork and knife no matter what.  I hope I don't sound like a grump, I did enjoy much of my meal.  The tortillas are fantastic. They are handmade, hot, fluffy, surprisingly flavorful. I'd get another sloppy burrito just to experience that tortilla again.  I ordered the Barbacoa since I had heard such great things about it, but I did not enjoy it. It was very sweet, which is fine in most BBQ, but this didn't seem to have any outstanding flavor besides overwhelming sweetness. Im more of a spicy kinda guy so I think this was probably just a bad choice for me, though I think there could have been more smokiness to the meat. Next time I will try it with steak or grilled chicken.  What I really need to tell you about is their chips, salsa, and queso dip. You must order these items. I know cafe rio is expensive, but it is absolutely necessary that you add this to your order. The chips are decent enough, but the salsa is great.. Probably the best I've had in Vegas so far. I didn't care for the salsa they put on my burrito but this one was delicious. The queso was awesome. Not the best I've ever had but definitely better than anything else I've had in town, and certainly a must have from cafe rio.  There is a pretty terrific collection of bottled hot sauces to add to your food if you're like me and enjoy a little food with your hot sauce.  I thought the staff was friendly enough, the dining room was clean and orderly.  Despite my many gripes with this place, there is a lot to like and I think it's definitely worth returning to.",

However the blue diamond location seems to just not care about their food quality, their customers, their wait times, etc.   This location is about 2 miles from my house and about 3 miles from my office so it's very convenient for lunch / dinner. In the past 3 months I have done 4 orders here and every one of them have been wrong in one way or another. From incorrect ingredients being placed into the order, missing items in our order, to food that tasted old.   I don't recommend this location to ANYONE! it's a horrible location, and the staff, supervisors included, could care less about their customers or the product they produce.",

    "text": "Run, crawl, moonwalk....do whatever you need to do to frequent this glorious establishment. My mouth waters at the sheer thought of their pork barbacoa. It's so flavorful and perfectly prepared I rarely can convince myself to get anything else. When I'm a starving beast, I go for the burrito. When I feel like behaving myself, I grab some enchiladas, but honestly with their fresh ingredients and wide array of choices, I don't think a poor choice is possible. The man in my life loves the fire grilled steak tacos.   Perhaps your first time around the ordering process may seem a bit stressful, there's a lot of cooks in the kitchen for sure. But once you get your favorites nailed down you'll be a pro! Pick certain items and you may even get a song (the nachos are most entertaining). They do have pick up with a dedicated register so if you can't handle the stress just call it in! There's usually a pretty decent wait at this location so this is a wise choice around dinner.   Lots of drinks to choose from too, including my favorite the Mint Limeade. Refreshing and delish! The 5th star was a necessity as they also offer your choice of favorite hot sauce! Any place that provides more condiments than you know what to do with earns major bonus points in my book. Tapatio, cholula, YUM!   Try it out, this location or any....I think you'll be very pleased!",

    "text": "This is literally the last time I deal with this location.   As a general manager of another food establishment I understand the regular issues that can happen; - someone taking an order incorrectly  - someone making the order incorrectly  - someone not performing a final quality check before the order is given to the guest  These are all things that happen, and I would be the type of person to be understanding due to my job.  My experience today was beyond unsatisfactory.  First I called in my order around 12 with a 45 min quote for pick up. That's ok, it's lunch. I am stuck at my job all day anyways 630 am to 7 pm so waiting for a good lunch is worth it. I order the same thing everytime. When Alexis answered the phone she seemed side tracked and not interested; she didn't even repeat the order to me. My order was rang up correctly on my receipt though (I later saw) so it had to be someone on the line. I had my driver pick up the order for me; I buy them lunch every Monday. The total cost of it was $36 and some change, so it should be worth it. When I got my order it was completely wrong. The sauce was wrong. The burrito was wrong. The toppings were wrong. But the receipt was right.   I call the location back and tell Alexis (who answers the phone again) that I wanted a refund on my burrito (just the part wrong) and she told me to hold and I went to a silent phone. Then mike got on the phone. I ask if he's the manager and he ignored me. He was so rude and short with me plus didn't even know the situation. I re-explained everything to him and he told me a refund couldn't be done without the card present. I ask him again is he the manager and he says no she is on the line. Now, I work at a food place remember? And I know when a guest calls, especially about a refund, you step away and handle the situation. I tell him I will hold till she is done and he says she has a meeting at 230 so she'll call me back before she goes. He takes my name and phone number down, and tells me she will call me back before her meeting. It's now been two hours and no call.  This is the WORST customer service I have ever experience and if ANY of my employees treated someone this way or my shift leader did not address the situation immediately I would immediately reevaluate their role in my location!!!",

Their service is terrible, lines take forever, and food - meh. We try to give it another chance and every time it's the same story.   Only go to this location when/if you're desperate for food.",

The workers here were very impolite during our ordering process and were very impatient when it came to trying to use our coupon. We asked the food server if our teacher appreciation coupon was still being honored and he was very unhelpful saying he was just a cook. So we asked the cashier and that worker said we had to do figure it out with the app. Both associates were very impolite and unhelpful in our order. We ended up leaving and taking our business elsewhere. I would not recommend this location to other customers",

I didn't want to say anything or make a scene so I just accepted my food because I WOULD frequent this cafe rio 2-3 times a week. Not anymore. I sure hope that woman changed her gloves after answering the phone WHILE wearing gloves and then entering the lobby I'm assuming you clean up the left food on the tables. But really? Come on this is disgusting. Only reason why they get a 2 star is because their customer service is decent.",

Cashier made a weird comment about me being early,  and then served the entire line of walk-ins before giving my food 12 min after the \"promised time\". I would have had it sooner just walking in to order it. Also, online ordering is confusing.  One of the orders was for 2 tacos, you then select the meats, but the order came in as 2 pork tacos and they gave us small cups with sides of the 2 meats we chose. This happened another time with a salad,  ordered pork with double meat but it rang in as a chicken taco with pork added. I'm sure it's just a design flaw of the site,  so my advice is double check when ordering.",

He was making to go orders and making a complete mess.. sloppily putting stuff in the trays,stuffs all over the work station. The girl trying to make our food asked him to clean it up and he said it's going to get dirty anyhow. He did proceed to \"clean\" it by taking a rag and shoving it off the counter on to the floor. So all the beans and meat and liquid are now on the floor...the girl asks him why he did that and he never said a word. He just walks around throwing things ,like the tongs. It is clear that the other workers can't stand working with the lazy ass. I said to the person I was with as he spilled shit all over making to go orders, what his house must look like cause he don't give a shit. From making food to cleaning, and I use that term loosely, to back to making food not once did he wash his hands.. I am very very thankful he was not making my food. He's a lazy bastard and really can't believe a manager would put up with that shit.  Also this is not the first time I go in and they are out of half the meats...how is it you are out of meat..shouldn't someone be cooking it?",

Usually the chicken salad is great, the quesadilla is huge and the tacos are full of flavor but this time the salad missed its mark.  Clearly someone forgot that they were cooking chicken today because my chicken salad has several pieces of chicken that have 3rd degree burns. The char is serious on this poor bird. Extra sauce isn't helping, scraping off the char isn't working and it seems like my salad is going to have to go without its chicken friend today.   This is the first bad salad I've had from CF and I pray this doesn't happen again. Rest In Peace chicken, for tho weren't edible and died in vein! Lol",

Starving. Another guy fixes my order, rushed and messy but whatever. I get home to eat it, chicken is cut so big It's hard to eat and I have to cut them smaller. Some pieces are super burnt, I had to spit it out and some don't seem cooked enough. Maybe I wouldn't be AS bothered but being 8.5 months pregnant with a cold, I was just over it.",

Instead this review is gonna cover this location itself.   Why 3 stars? Inconsistent food quality. I come here quite often given how convenient the location is and Cafe Rio is admittedly quick easy food, especially when I want a burrito. Sometimes the rice is undercooked and weirdly hard. Sometimes the meat seems overcooked and difficult to chew. Sometimes the person puts a boat load of cheese and other times it's barely enough.  Other than that, not much to note. Overall pretty big storefront with lots of seating space. I've been here during prime lunch and dinner times and it can get pretty busy but the staff is usually friendly and they move the line quickly so the wait is never long.   So yeah, basically I haven't had an issue with this Cafe Rio otherwise inconsistent food quality.",

The tortillas are made fresh and you can see the lady making them while you are In line which is pretty cool. The cheese dip was pretty tasty as well. I will defiantly be back because the food was great BUT the staff was not so great.  No one was smiling so it just felt awkward at first, and considering I had never been there before I didn't really know how it worked or what was good to put on my food or what even my options where. I just went down the line and the worker just looked at me waiting for me to talk, without asking me what I wanted. So it was kind of weird and I didn't see tortilla strips until he had moved on to the next person, let's just say I felt rushed and awkward. Then getting to the checkout part of the line and the girl rings my boyfriend and I up and gives me a total and I give her money.  Then some other worker (not part of ordering process) comes up and looks at the tray of food and says \"make sure you charge her for that cheese and sour cream.\" Without a smile or even a glance my way. The girl did not respond and just changed my total and said you didn't give me enough money..... yes I did for the first total not the one the very rude girl created by telling you to add charges! In my option the price for cheese compared to the amount I got was not worth it and I was not informed the items I was adding to my dish would be extra. Overall they need a more upbeat and informative staff.",

The workers were hollering at each other about the pork then finally one said the last shift left then none. Unprofessional. My husband orders his food and was about to pay when he realized the worker has forgot the tortilla strips on his food and mentioned it and the worker threw it on his food and pushed it to the cashier. 10 mins goes by still no pork for my burrito. The workers were standing around laughing giggling and showed no concerns about me standing there. I was about to let them know to forget about it then pork was ready. The worker topping my food had an attitude and was just tossing food into my container. When we asked for a manager's card the cashier told us there wasn't one but told us his name is humberto but the supervisor was on duty. My husband asked who that was who does she point to? The worker that was throwing our toppings on to our food. Yep no thank you. It would of been  pointless to speak to her cause obviously she does not know how to run a shift and could care less of what her workers are doing. Unorganized and chaotic.

Cafe Rio is a fast casual Mexican restaurant...so these reviews about their customer service needs to stop...they are not meant to run like a dining restaurant...  I tried ordering 10 chicken tacos but they didn't have enough chicken for 10 so I settled for what they had + some steak tacos. It was late so I understand and appreciate that they don't just have an abundance of ingredients out, ready for the next day the night before. I had the tacos with lettuce cheese guacamole and their house sauce. The guacamole was alright...I can do without next time.  They have a ton of hot sauces to choose from which is just amazing because who doesn't like to have options?  The food is decent and the portions are pretty big for the price you pay. I would go back whenever I'm craving a quick bite...there are definitely a lot of options to choose from.   Try them out:)",

(: Nice because who wants to sit inside when it is a nice beautiful day outside?! Anyways yes. I went with the top most favorite order. Sweet and Sour Barbacoa burrito and the taco salad.   What a surprise! Everything is so freshly made. The tortilla, the burrito, the salad. All in front of your eyes. Can't get any more fresh than that! The taste is like explosion in your mouth. Seriously it's packed with flavor. Sweet and sour from the barbacoa but tangy from the enchilada sauce and their house sauce. Yum! Taste even better with hot sauce (;  The portions are huge too!!

We only go here out of convenience of where it's at but after tonight we had to walk out before ordering. We waited for 10 minutes and watched all of the employees laugh and hang out and make their OWN FREE food, then when we asked if we could order they said no because they were busy. I've never seen such unprofessionalism from such a large franchise. It sucks because we like cafe rio but the food and service quality is so embarrassing to their name. I recommend that a manager or someone higher up come in anonymously and experience first hand what a horrible job the staff at this location does.",

My absolute favorite are the chicken tacos on corn tortilla. They make everything right in front of you and you get to choose and pick what you want. Generally I just get it with cheese, pico and lettuce and a side of rice. The shredded chicken is sooooooo tasty and moist. Service is great, they have these lil chants if you are a first timer, if you want extra cheese, etc. Their frequent stamp card definitely motivates me to come back. and I will be back. YUM!",

    "text": "Ok Cafe Rio, I'm very disappointed with you.  I eat or at least used to eat at Cafe Rio about 1-3 times per week.  I can agree with some of the other reviews regarding customer service, but I always ignored it because they generally make my food correctly. Plus the food is good and portions are huge.  Well, I recently took a break from dairy, which makes me very sad, but it is what it is.  Considering I usually order the grilled chicken tostada with creamy Ranch type dressing I was pretty nervous that it wouldn't taste the same without dairy. My friend recommended I get avocado instead of sour cream. Great idea, right?  So I order my salad, no rice, no cheese, no sour cream, no dressing. Oh wait can I sub avocado for the sour cream?  Counter guy: doesn't answer, just puts it in my bowl. Ok. Great.  I get to the checkout and the cashier tells me it will be $. 95 to add guacamole. So I ask her, even though I didn't get cheese, sour cream or dressing? She doesn't reply and just adds the extra to my total.   Normally, I may have said something, but I'm so tired of having to argue or complain to receive appropriate customer service.  I think I'll give my normal Cafe Rio another try (on Eastern) but if I get the same treatment I may just be over this place. Obviously they don't care about my business.  It's frustrating because the amount of guacamole that you receive is paltry. I mean for a dollar I should at least get a full scoop.  I used to rave about this place to anyone that would listen, but now I'll take my business to a place that can accommodate my dietary restrictions.",

Granted, the dining area is large and the queue is fast, and the prices are fair, but everything had a heavy, processed taste.  By \"everything\" I mean the beans/cheese/rice burrito and a pair of cheese enchiladas. The burrito (2/3 left unfinished) was a mass of funky beans with very little else going on. (The advertised peppers and onions and whatnot were just a floppy sprinkle on the side. The cheese and rice was almost non-existent. And it sure didn't taste like the advertised cotija.) The enchiladas were better, but \"less offensive\" doesn't equal \"good.\"  Disappointing, and I'm probably being swayed by the idea of Cafe Rio more than the actual experience to even give it two stars. Yes, the menu is more varied than Del Taco and Taco Bell, but the taste is almost the same... on a good day.",

He apologized for our experience and offered to send a certificate for 2 free meals to my email the following day.  He also said to call him directly if we encounter any problems.  The next day rolls around and still nothing from him.  I called his cellphone and it kept going to a mailbox that hadn't been set up yet so I call the store.  You would think he would have seen the missed calls and called me back.  I called this store and they said he'll be back in a few days.  I call again in a few days and apparently just missed him.  Nine days had passed and I still could't get in contact with him.  I had waited on hold for 25 mins today only to be told to call back in 30 mins because they were busy.  I waited and called back.  The employee was rude and put the phone down to get Umberto.  I heard someone in the background say he had left.  Instead of the employee telling me this, she just hung up on me.  Now this becomes more about principle than two free meals.  I ended up calling their corporate office and spoke to Elaine.  She was very apologetic and instantly credited my account for the meals.  She also advised the Regional Manager.  For an Area Coach to not keep his word is not acceptable and reflects poorly on the company he represents.  I will not frequent this location for a very long time, if ever.  I will try the location on Durango since they have better Yelp reviews.",

Food is amazing and despite bad line management it's worth it. If you're in a hurry, try another place. People are friendly and service is good.

Then we go to order the chips and queso and we're told they don't have any. I ask when they would have it made and they all looked confused. Finally the cashier goes and asks the guy in the back and he advises at least a 30 minute wait. We didn't get an apology or anything. First how do you run a promotion and not have any cheese made? This was not a good first impression on a new customer.  The burrito was good, even though we ate mostly rice, beans, lettuce and tomato.

Definitely not proportionate to the rest of the items. The meal tasted very bland, had WAY too much cheese and sauce, and the rice ended up tasting like soup because it was soaking up all the sauce they poured in there.   Low quality food here, which is not my cup of tea.",

The food that I've gotten is always flavorful and fresh. I particularly love their house dressing! It's delicious.  The entire place is always very clean and organized, which, of course, is a must!  Their prices are a little on the high side to be a quick service restaurant. Just a salad will run you $10.  The lunch time is the best time to go, because there are a lot of people so you move quickly through the line. They're also more hospitable during that time.  Versus the afternoon/night time when the lines move slower and hospitality isn't at its best.  Overall, it's one of my go to spots in the area !",

My girlfriend wanted vegetarian tacos (rice, beans, cheese, and avocado).  They made the tacos when my girlfriend noticed that they did not have avocado in them.  She was told they were out of those too, after they made the food.  The employee then offered a side of meat (for vegetarian tacos) or an extra side of salsa or dressing as if either of those would be a good substitute.  Their limeade is delicious, but they were also out of that.    How is a Mexican restaurant out of steak, avocados, and their \"signature beverage\"?",

While it is certainly not going to be featured on an episode of Top Chef it is a solid dining option, especially if you are in a hurry. I have eaten here dozens of times and can say it is friendly, clean, and in my experience the food is consistently good. Just last week I tried the new chicken fajitas option and was very pleasantly surprised at how tasty they were. The flour tortillas were pipping hot, fresh, and delicious, The grilled chicken was quite good (always is here), the chipotle sauce was spicy and tasty, and the guacamole was fresh. I can certainly understand the frustration with a bad take out order, based on several reviews I read, but as a dine in option I can certainly reccomend this location.",

However, when I placed a to-go order earlier this week, the experience was awful.  I placed my order at 11:30am.  App advised the order would be ready at 12:15pm.  I arrived at 12:02pm.  Was asked by 4 different employees, over a span of 8 minutes, if we had been helped yet and was told to wait and someone would help us.  Nearly 10 minutes after the order pick up time, the cashier took the payment and scanned my app for rewards. 15 minutes after order pick up time, an employee held up a white slip of paper and yelled to me \"I make your salad now.\"  The order was finally ready at 12:49pm, over 30 minutes AFTER the pick up time and over 45 minutes AFTER we arrived!  There were customers that entered the restaurant when we did, waited in line, ordered their food, ate and LEFT and we were STILL waiting for our pre-ordered food.  I love their food, but the service at this location is horrible.  Even after the long wait, no one apologized for the delay or the wait or the grossly missed pick up time.  In the past, an apology was given along with a cup to enjoy a beverage while I waited.  Oh yeah, and all 3 salads I ordered were made wrong and missing ingredients.  Even if it's out of your way, GO TO A DIFFERENT LOCATION.  This one is sure to disappoint.",

I come here because of convenience to my house and the food is seriously amazing. But I often drive past this one to go to Henderson.

Tonight just really made me want to write this review. My husband went to buy us dinner and he ordered a salad and asked for them to put extra dressing in the bag. (He was getting it to-go.) However, he drove home and there was no dressing in the bag, whatsoever. So, he drove 20 minutes back to the restaurant to get the dressing and the restaurant doors were locked at 9:45pm. The restaurant closes at 10pm...Needless to say my husband was frustrated, so he knocked on the glass until he saw one of the workers. The worker then, raised his hands with an attitude and rudely yelled, \"we're closed.\" It's the terrible attitude/customer service that makes this a 1 star review. The food is great that's the only reason we come back. Yes, we understand mistakes happen, we are human but \"apologize, listen, empathize, offer a solution\" simple customer service.",

If I were rating it on the staff I would give it a 1 star because of the 1 employee that was nice.    First off the other reviews on how terrible the customer service is at this locaton are completely right. They rush you through the line so fast that you don't get enough time to tell them what you want and what you don't want on your plate, then when you get something thrown on that you didn't want, they get so mad if you have the nerve to tell them you didn't want that.    I don't understand why the wait takes so long to  order because by the time you get helped you feel almost dizzy from the whirlwind of fast questions thrown at you. Its so bad that when I go there with more than two meals to order I litterally have to  rehearse my order so they don't get frustrated with me for taking up too much time. I hate it!   We have tried to order over the phone and thats a nightmare too! They always get something wrong on it and I'm not sure if there is a designated cashier for to go orders because I have sat there for at least ten minutes before someone even acknowledges that I am there.   Now that chicken salad.... we always get the grilled chicken salad with house dressing and its really yummy! A bit pricey but its a good size. I recommend getting a side order of the hot sauce which will run you another dollar but its great when I  pour a little on the salad too. The tortilla soup is also good. Another item that we get if you are not terribly hungry is a side salad, we order that with a side of grilled chicken and its also really good. The homemade tortillas are good enough to eat all by themselves. We really enjoy the food here I just wish the customer service was better because this is our closest location but we have no problem driving a little further for better service.",

I don't think they want to be known as fast food, especially since it's somewhat slow and made to order, but there is an uneasy feeling when the warm meat portion of your entree is sitting on the vegetable line for a few minutes before the next employee is ready to ask you what you're having even though you already ordered. Seems monotonous.   Once my \"fire grilled steak\" sat for a couple of minutes, the next assembly line employee asked what I was having (even though I already ordered).  I realized the quickest option was to tell her, \"however it comes\". Still didn't matter as they were behind on orders.   I came to a third employee who asked what my order was. Apparently they work on the honor system. This gentleman seemed to be the only employee with a sense of urgency. He attempted to get caught up on multiple orders that were well behind the ticket time. No one else seemed to care or understand. I hope he gets promoted to management. They need it there.   3 stars for the average food. Would love to have it made to order as advertised.   4th star for the one person who understood urgency and hospitality.",

    "text": "I just never get tired of this place.   Cafe Rio takes Chipotle's concept and puts it on steroids. Juicier meat, tastier sauces and dressings, and faster and friendlier staff.   I most often order the salad which includes your choice of meat (shredded or grilled chicken, grilled steak, or barbacoa), your choice of beans (black or pinto), rice, lettuce, pico, guacamole, lime wedge, cilantro, cheese and tostada chips. You also get your choice of dressings, the creamy cilantro is to die for!  My favorite part of this is the chicken. I always get the shredded chicken and it is deliciously moist and packed with flavor.   My husband orders the shredded chicken nachos, and he loves that they sing a silly song when he does. It makes me laugh every time.   They give our daughter (11months old) a free quesadilla. This probably doesn't seem like much but as a parent who's been charged over and over for food that is inevitably going to end up on the floor, I totally appreciate it!   The tortillas here are handmade (you can watch them do it) on site and they are so good! Sometimes I come in and just take one to go as a snack (though I would not recommend during lunch or dinner rush).   It's the little things that take a place with good food and make it a great restaurant. This place has got it all and that is why I keep going back.",

My fav is the shredded chicken burrito w/ rice & black beans, enchilada style (verde sauce & melted cheese over the burrito).  I like the meat quality, seasoning & drink selection better at Cafe Rio over Chipotle.  The spice level at Chipotle is a little much for my 3yr old plus the free nino quesadilla is an added bonus.  Our total including drinks today was ~$25.",

Cons:   Can be pricy (let's remember this is still fast food), about $10 for a 3 taco steak order and no drink, you be the judge.  Consistently rude staff at the food assembly line (see other reviews)  Food although fresh, tends to be soggy and messy, and generally looks terrible.  Not sure how clean this place is, as I've seen dirty tables and cross contamination when staff refills and prepares the food.  Rude staff (I know I mentioned this but I must reiterate)   Anyhow, ultimately I'm dissatisfied with this Cafe Rio location and I wouldn't recommend going.   However, if you don't mind the rude staff that gives you plenty of condescending looks just because you take more than 2 seconds to decide between pinto or black beans, then go for it.    The last time I checked, we were the customers and that used to mean something.",

Really, a total disaster, except for one individual at the Cedar City location, who actually cared enough to make sure we finally received our food.    I thought I'd give them another chance at a different location (this LV location) and found very similar results - bland, over-sauced, overly sweet, zero-heat (both senses of the word), lack of organization, incorrectly charged, clueless and careless staff.  I'd go to Chipotle any day over Cafe Rio.  And yes, the wait time was horrible at 7:30pm on a Sunday.",

    "text": "I'm giving this location two stars instead of one just because I love cafe rio so much.   I downloaded this app just to make a review and this will also be my first review of anything ever.   The last 4 times I have been to this location the service has got progressively worse. The first two times it didn't have anything to do with me and both times it was the same Asian employee. 3rd time the white kid with tattoos on his arms who might be a semi new hire and the 4'8\" Mexican lady that usually runs the cash register we the ones to  blame. 4th time was the most ridiculous visit. I walk in and there is only one person in line and he was getting steak nachos and asked for extra steak, which they were out of. He said he would wait because it looked like the steak was almost done cooking on the grille. I wanted a steak salad and I said I would wait as well. The front line person told the kid on the grille who's name I want to say is Jason or Chris that we need steak. Just so happened the two people behind me wanted steak also so at this point the whole line was stopped and everyone was just awkwardly standing there. So the front line lady told the grille cook again that we really need that steak right now and he just nods his head. I work in the industry and I know how people's misconception of time is so ill try to be very accurate. About 1.5 min later he starts slowly taking the meat off and putting it into a metal container, which I understand it need to cook all the way. He then proceeded to go into the back and get a new container of mean and then loads the grille up with the raw meat. At this point everyone is getting super aggravated. The front line lady tells him again that we need the steak asap. He slowly washes his hands and puts gloves on and then a metal glove over the food service glove and then a plastic glove over the metal. So it's been about 2-3 more min sense he put the raw meat on and then he starts seasoning it and waits about 30second and then he starts slowly and I mean slowly flipping the meat!!! The girl then again asks him for the steak now and he finally starts chopping it up. At this point there is about 12 people behind me.   Sorry for the rant and if anyone from cafe rio is reading this I hope it was as painful to read as my experience was.",

    "text": "I've tried to be hopeful with this place but every single time I find myself very disappointed. From the sub par service to the mediocre food. After today, I will not be going back. Reason being is, I had brought a friend of mine from back east to try it out. We finished eating and walked out to the car. I realized I had forgotten my cell phone on the table (roughly 2-3 minutes) so I went back in to get it. It wasn't on the table so I asked a few employees and eventually one of them had my phone in her apron. I was relieved and walked back out to my car. Once I got out to my car I noticed that my cell phone had been powered off. Hmmmm, interesting right? Why would someone power off a customer's cell phone within 2-3 minutes of it being left behind?? Because they had ill will intentions of stealing it! Common sense is if someone loses their phone and can't find it, one of the first things they do is CALL IT in hopes of someone with integrity will answer and give it back to it's rightful owner. So powering the phone off would make that nearly impossible. Of course, I went back inside and asked one of the employees what the girl's name was. The employee responded \"I don't know\". Really? You don't know who you work with? So, I then ask another employee, which happened to be the manager and she told me that her name was EMILY. Never did the manager ask what my concern was. I confronted Emily and asked her why she powered off my cell phone in such a short period of time of finding it and kept it in her apron instead of handing it over to her supervisor. She was speechless. I told her, you wouldn't have powered off my cell phone if you didn't have intentions of keeping it, right?  She then responded \"I have my own cell phone, I don't need yours. I turned it off so it wouldn't bother anyone if it rang\". Yeah, okay. The manager then came over and I explained to her what had happened and she seemed stunned and agreed that EMILY shouldn't have done that. What happened after that and if Emily was held accountable, I don't know. I had to leave for a meeting.  However, I did call the corporate office but, unfortunately, they are closed on Sunday. I will try again on Monday.",

So I have to order everything over again, one fish taco meal, two chile beef tacos, chips and salsa-queso.  Pretty straightforward and simple, but they don't listen to you. I was asked twice if I wanted cheese on the tacos, I said yes but somehow it never made it to the tacos.  When I noticed that the server was placing everything in one container, I reminded her that the fish taco was a meal..  She told me don't worry about it, my jaw is still wide open after hearing her talk to me like that!  Now I get to the cashier and she asks me for the whole order once again.  I still don't have my sides of rice and beans or the chips or salsa.  The cashier has to ask Don't worry about it for the rice and beans and chips and salsa, amazing.  So now I get the side dishes in a to go container, and she has to ask me if I want another container.  I say yes, because miss don't worry about it did not put it together as a meal.  After I pay for this mess, we go to our table.  The cashier tells me she forgot to ring up my chips and salsa-queso, but I show her the receipt with chips and salsa only rang up.  She tells me don't worry about it, and this time I dont! The worse thing about the whole episode is that the food was horrible to boot.   One thing they will not have to worry about is me coming back to this place!!!",

    "text": "So tried to do something nice and I'm not sure it got done. Went to Cafe Rio, on Blue Diamond for lunch on 07/18/2014 at 1145am.  While in line, I noticed two soldiers in uniform walk in. They looked young and I wanted to say thank you for your service. They were two people behind me. When I got to the register, I asked if I could pay some extra on my bill to be used toward their bill. This is when it got weird. I got nothing but attitude, a roll of the eyes and a huge sigh. So, because I was paying with my ATM card, I asked if it would be easier if I put cash down to use for them. That was accepted with a little frustration. I went to sit down and watch to see if the money I left was used as I intended. I honestly couldn't tell. I am blown away. I tried to do something nice and help out with what I could and I feel as if it was only an exercise in futility. I am upset that the staff at Cafe Rio was not a little more accepting of my gesture.  To top it off, my four year old spilled her drink, which I wore.  My friend went to ask for help and alert them of the dangerous wet spill on the floor.  They acted as if it was some sort of intrusion and huge inconvenience, (excuse me but I AM the one wearing Orchata).  Then when someone came over, she used napkins to clean up (which left everything still sticky) and ignored me completely as I apologized and attempted to assist in cleaning up. (it was my kid that did it after all)    In conclusion the food is great but the staff is disgruntled at best.  Not an ounce of friendliness among anyone working the front line.  The cashier blew me away with her attitude.  it will be a while before i go back and I will not go during the lunch hour ever again.",

Decided to go with the 'award winning' Pork Barbacoa burrito, which while delicious, quickly fell apart in my hands leaving their sauce everywhere and causing me to have to get a knife/fork to finish it. The restaurant has a very similar ordering/seating arrangement to Chipotle/Qdoba. I was very pleased with the serving size compared to a similar meal at Chipotle, and with it being rather close to home, I'll be sure to stop by and try some other dishes (hopefully ones that don't fall apart after 2 bites).",

Everything on the menu is amazing- although the serve huge portions so be sure to head there with an appetite!  The best  on the menu in my opinion is the salad- I am a chicken fan but the pork is excellent as well.  Even the tortilla soup is amazing (if you are looking for something on the lighter side!)  The staff is pretty comical as well- they sing and chant to the first time customers and to the patrons that have earned a free meal with their \"frequent eater card\".  I heart Cafe Rio!!!!",

There is food spilled all over, the staffs family is in with their toddlers frequently, 2 year olds touching and pulling down the cups set up by the register. I could walk in this location and while waiting in line I can pick out a dozen health code violations and I don't work for the health department, but, it's common sense stuff. There are always flys buzzing around and not to mention the tables are filthy and sticky and clearly dirty. Sitting at a table for me, is not an option. Last time I did they were filthy! The floors are sticky and dirty, as I left you can see all the filth and hand prints on the glass doors. I have actually even reported this location to the health department over a year ago after I spoke with the manager and he flat out told me if I didn't like their practices to go to a different location. WHAT?  It does not appear my report to the health department did any good. This sucks because this is the side of town I live on and I crave cafe rios food the way it is supposedly to be. So if you want good cafe rio, you have to go to the S.Eastern location or Stephanie st. in Henderson. Skip this place if you want to feel ok after you eat. I have had to recook my food when I get home, after buying at this location to ensure I don't get sick. I wish something would change. But it's been almost 2 years of the exact same! Good luck if you go there!",

We love to get the pork burritos here - buyer beware that the pork is on the sweeter side.  That might turn off some people, but we really like it.  The ambience of this place is good.  Brand new and clean.  This particular location can get a bit crowded though, especially during dinner hours.  Whats especially great is that you could just walk over to the Golden Spoon next door for some dessert =).  One of my main things I like to get is their steak tostada.  It's pretty much a taco salad.  They put a hard flat taco shell at the bottom and pile it high with some rice, beans, a ton of lettuce, sour cream, cheese pico de gallo, and those little tortilla chip strips.  I think it's a good option if your kind of watching what you eat (just x out the cheese and sour cream).  I really love their creamy dressing too.  If you're getting a burrito or tacos though, look out of the extras like sour cream and guacamole though - they cost extra and they don't tell you that when you are ordering.  Overall, A-OK if your looking for a change from the normal Chipotle.",

I try the raspberry tea, they have some so I fill my cup up with ice, only get a little bit before it runs out.  Then I try to fill my cup with lemonade to make an Arnold Palmer.  The machine is out of lemonade.  I go up to the counter to the employee there to let her know the lemonade is out as well as the Passion Tea.  She says she will go fix it.  After waiting for something to happen, I go up again to ask about it and they say she had to fix it in the back.  I ask her again about the teas after noticing all THREE teas they have are all gone, if they can make some more, which she says she can one at a time which will take about 5 minutes each.  I wait until it's been 5 minutes and it's still not done brewing.  At that time, I just wanted to go home and eat my food.

I would have stuck around and waited for it.  While waiting in line I decided since I was there I'd try the new spicy hatch chili chicken in a quesadilla. When I got to the topping options they were out of sour cream. The kid offered me an additional scoop of guacamole as a substitute.  The cellphone service in there is crap (I have verizon) and there is no wifi. I mention this because at checkout I tried to have them scan my phone for their rewards program and it didn't work due to no service.  This isn't the first time I've had issues at this cafe too location. I love cafe rio food and this location is on my way home from work.  I was so pissed when I left that I called the Rhode's Ranch location on Durango & Warm Springs to see if they had queso dip. They did and that will be the only location I'll be returning to.

What I can comment on.. -Nachos:  Missing San Diego, I had them create nachos with just sour cream, double chicken, and cheese.  I have to say, one of the best 2000 calories i consumed in one time in a along time.  -Burritos:  Kept it simple again.  Just the chicken and rice.  I'm not really into the messy wet burritio so I had them just add a small amount.    Portions are huge and the meals are delicious.  Service is a quick cafeteria/assembly line type ordering. I like it.  At least you can see exactly how your food is being prepared.   TIP:  Get your side sauces before you pay or while you are ordering.  They never ask if you need any and there isn't any in the condiment area or tables.",

I honestly blame the manager for allowing this. From what I have read in the yelp reviews though apparently her staff is following by example. This location used to be fast and full of happy employees. Man has it taken a turn for the worse. They have employees that work the line that don't even know what comes on the damn salad!

You can see the tortillas being hand made, tomatoes being crushed, and chicken right on the grill. The food is fresh and delicious.  However, you'll likely miss the visuals of the high quality food as you stare, baffled, at the inefficiency of the employees. Lacking any kind of leadership during any time of day, the staff grouchily fumbles through their tasks at snail-like speed, often making mistakes and never coming anywhere close to a smile. Organization is a word that doesn't exist behind the cooking line or in the sticky, dysfunctional dining room. The drink station offers great limeade and on-point horchata, if you can pull the soles of your shoes out of the syrupy, sticky floor surrounding it.  Don't even think of coming around dinner time unless your definition of a good time includes standing in line for an hour and listening to fellow patrons openly complain about the speed of service.  Maybe at some point my lunch and dinner funds will afford the staff a field trip to a Chipotle to learn how to work in an efficient, clean establishment.",

I'm not expecting Four Seasons treatment at a fast casual place, but can I get a hello and a smile? My god. They just stare and give nods instead of questions, put the wrong stuff on my order, despite very clear directions.  Then in the middle of order, there was some kind of molasses speed shift change. They had 20+ workers standing around chatting. Now a line of ten people forms behind me and I haven't moved. The new guy grabs my salad and starts loading it up with everything without asking. I had to start over. The workers are bumping each other, touching  everything, and joking around.   Finally they try to get me to pay for someone else's meal, then try to over charge me. Just the worst.  I'd like to say I'll never be back. But in a few months I'll forget and be a glutton again.   This place is the worst. Do not come here. Give your money to someone else until they fix their management problem which has been ongoing for years.",

Lady at the cash register was touching customers food with no gloves and to make it worse she was handling cash before hand. All in all I wouldn't even give this location a store one star but there's no option for that on yelp.

How is it faster if I stand in line when have had my order for 45minutes?! They told me it would be an additional 20 minutes to make my order but they could magically make it faster if I stood in line in 10 min before ordering the exact same thing they had on the receipt in front of them. No sense in coming back. I have tried time and time again, and every time it gets worse. This will be my last trip to place I at one point in my life came to weekly. So with this, so long cafe rio.",

Since I don't get any of the other toppings on my salad, they load up on the lettuce. At this location, it's just the minimum amount of lettuce. And I'm like \"uh that's it?\"   3.

The line was extremely slow and no one appeared happy to be serving customers.   The dining room and drink station were a wreck. In fact the signs above the horchata and strawberry lemonade were mixed up and the employee told me that they just never changed the signs and I should be able to figure out which drink was which?  How about we fix the signs and clean the area instead of arguing about my ability to interpret which beverage is mislabeled? I can see a diabetic consuming the wrong beverage and suing.  Overall, food was great. Everything else was poorly managed. I agree with other reviewers that this location is \"ghetto\".",

Upon checking out my steak salad, I wasn't even offered a beverage....awesome.   Food quality would've been better if My taco salad didn't have a pool of liquid grease on the bottom...now I can't even eat the tortilla because it's drenching. Such a shame because the tortilla is really good too.  Awesome sauce, pun not intended.",

    "text": "I love Cafe Rio. The Eastern location has never disappointed me; however, in the past two online orders I've done for this Blue Diamond location, there's always something either missing or incorrect. Normally, I would disregard if something was missing if it wasn't anything major, but today, I ordered a chicken tostada, extra lettuce, black beans and no rice, lime on the side. My container had five bites of lettuce, a handful of cilantro, no lime to be seen, and beans in EVERY SINGLE BITE. Why would I pay for an extra 2oz of delicious tomatillo dressing when there's no lettuce!? The normal 2oz of dressing that it comes with was TOO MUCH for what I had today.   I feel like I am eating sour cream and cilantro with chicken and beans that happens to have bits of lettuce. HORRIBLE. UNFORTUNATE for such a known name to have such terrible results when it comes to constructing food that is in a food line that only requires someone to read down the list of what to put onto a container.  I am extremely disappointed. I cannot believe I'm considering driving down to the Eastern location just to get the correct order and have a decent amount of food in my container.",

    "text": "This is my second time at this location, its located off of Arville on Blue Diamond, not far from the I15 Blue Diamond exit. It is inside a shopping center tucked into a corner, fairly easy to find. You walk right in and there is colorful wallpaper everywhere, and after you wind through people eating you find the line queue.   It was semi-busy, it took about 5 minutes to get someone to take my order which I thought was fairly fast considering how many people were online. Very fast assembly line system. I ordered the salad, pinto beans, with shredded chicken, I was through in about 2 minutes and paying for my meal.  My only negative is that while i was waiting for my meal to be made I asked the server a question and she looked like me like I had a thousand heads, she turned to her colleagues and they had the same reaction, finally someone came by and answered my question. I then realized they didn't speak english. All I asked was which was the spiciest sauce they had and no one can tell until someone save the day.  Great so I got my food and was told the Cholula and Tapatio were by the drink fountain. Awesome!!! What a wide array of hot sauce all at your disposal!! I filled my cup of water and grabbed me a bottle of Tapatio. I doused my salad with the hot sauce like putting out a fire with water hoping for the opposite effect. And I got exactly what I had hoped for.   Once you dig through the top of the salad you hit pay dirt, the shredded chicken and it tasted fresh and very savory, had a good flavor. The whole salad sits on a large soft tortilla which you find yourself picking apart at the end, at least I did. Next time I come back I will have to try one of their burritos as they looked really good. Will the burrito match up to Chipotle's or be better? Someone let me know!",

They use fresh ingredients which is evident in the tastes of their food.      I have had their salad, burritos, quesadilla, tortilla soup and enchiladas.  They are all very good and their cost is quite reasonable.    Their competition would be Chipotle and Moe's.  I have been to all 3 and Cafe Rio is much better due to better ingredients and freshly made tortillas.      It doesn't matter the time of day there is always a line but it moves fast.  The restaurant is clean and the staff is friendly.  Great for lunch and dinner.",

I would give 0 stars but it's not an option  I swear you have to repeat your order a minimum of 3 times and they still will mess it up. The lady who was cooking the chicken was also eating the chicken at the same time. They yelled out for more chicken several times but she was too busy eating to actually realize that customers were standing around waiting on her to refill the chicken container. The food is slopped together. They don't bother letting the food sit on the grill long enough, so the cheese isn't even partially melted. The restaurant was dirty. Looked liked they hadn't swept the floors in weeks. I am a big Cafe Rio fan...but not anymore. Yikes...and if you're worried about hygiene...this isn't the place for you. They do all sorts of activities without ever changing their gloves or washing their hands. Surprised that I haven't got food poisoning.",

    "text": "I recently visited the location on 4830 Blue Diamond Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89139 on Saturday June 24th.  This was my 2nd time dining at a Cafe Rio, the 1st time being a week ago at the location on Durango Rd.  I was highly impressed with the quality of the food and the service from my 1st experience, so I decided to stop by again at a location closer to my home.  Unfortunately, the 2nd time around was not a pleasurable experience.  I received lackluster service and encountered severely unprofessional staff members. I arrived around 10pm and the store wasn't busy at all.  A few patrons in the dining room, and no one in line, so I walked straight to the front.  There were 2 employees present with their backs turned to the line, one of which was playing on her cell phone in clear view on the food service line (she ended up being the cashier).  After waiting for a bit, I was finally acknowledge by a female staff member who said \"we'll be right with you in a second,\" and she calls to the frontline chef who was in a back area.  After the frontline chef comes up, he asks me \"what do you want?\" to which I asked \"Do the nachos come with a protein?\"  I was extremely appalled when he answered \"What?!\".  Not an excuse me, pardon me, or could you please repeat that?  But straight up \"What?!\"  So after repeating my question, I continued on with my order.   About halfway through ordering my 2nd item, another staff member comes up and asks the frontline chef about garbage bags, so the chef stops talking to me and starts talking to his coworker instead.  After finally completing my order, the frontline chef turns his back and starts angrily talking to himself, complaining about the one who asked him about the garbage bags.  I clearly hear him say \"n*gga\" multiple times, and the female staff member discretely tells him \"stop saying the n-word!  They might hear you!\" to which the chef didn't seem to care nor stop his rant. At that point, my food was almost ready, and the female staff member could tell I was a little perturbed, so she was then extra nice and attentive to me, and decided to start using \"sir\" while adding the finishing touches to my order.  I then paid and promptly left the store. I wasn't expecting a fine dining level of service, but at the very least acknowledge me, don't treat me like I'm stupid, be polite/respectful and lastly be professional.  I didn't experience any of the above at that location.  I work in customer service myself and have worked food service as well, so I get it.  Now, I'm not trying to get anyone in trouble or reprimanded, but I really wanted to bring this to your attention.  I'm a simple person, and very easy going, but the way I was treated and the way the staff acted was despicable.",

Caveat: I don't know what anything else tastes like because I keep just ordering the Barbacoa Salad with extra Barbacoa. I have no plans to change my order. If you had said salad you wouldn't either.  The bad: This one is stingy with the meat compared to the one on eastern. Also the whole restaurant doesn't need to know I want extra meat.

For the quality of the food, it's definitely not worth it. Even though we do have a family, five that's no excuse for how much time it takes. Almost took 60 minutes for 2 quesadillas, 2 salads, and 1 taco that's nowhere near how much it would take to go to a drive through nearby that is much better. They definitely need to step up their quality if they want more money and service.",

    "text": "I have eaten here one other time and would describe it as \"meh\". My first encounter took place about 6 months ago on a Wednesday during the lunch rush - high noon.  It was busy, but no big deal. As I got up to order though, the worker at the start of the line started yelling at me- like, YELLING at me \"WHAT DO YOU WANT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!?????\" It immediately gave a prison mess hall vibe. Not to mention that the 37 people in front of me were not even starting to move any closer to the register so chill, homie. I ordered a chicken burrito. $1 extra for grilled chicken, on a $8 burrito... Somebody should tell these guys that it costs more to braise something for 3 hours than it does to grill it for 10 minutes. Throw some thighs on the grill and hit it with a little lime juice and salt and call it a day,  but dont charge extra for chicken- CHICKEN. He threw some rice, beans, and shredded chicken in a tortilla, and went for the sauce ladle in an attempt to slather everything in sauce and cheese. Enchilada-style is another up sell I am not interested in, and he seemed put off at my refusal. Then he sent it through a conveyor belt toaster oven exactly like a Quiznos sandwich. When it came out the other end I had to wait a good 9 minutes to seal the deal because there were so many other people's food in front of mine. It seems like you would want to put all the ingredients in a burrito before you roll it, but not Cafe Rio. They prefer to unroll and reroll after toasting it. Finally, some girl grabbed my cold-toasted-shredded-chicken burrito and asked if I want anything else in it. I was over it and said no to put myself out of my misery, and paid $12 for a chicken, rice, and bean burrito, with a small fountain drink. There was no trace of salt present in any one of the 4 ingredients, and it fell apart the second I picked it up. You would think that if someone does nothing but roll burritos day-in and day-out, and yells at people about their burritos, that guy can probably roll a pretty goddam good burrito. He totally didnt. I came by to give them another chance tonight. It was 9:30 pm and they close at 11. The guy that previously yelled at me and gave me a shitty burrito wrap was eating at one of the tables toward the front, and another young guy was at first base on the line stuffing tortillas. I was looking to go big so I ordered a GRILLED chicken burrito and a taco  to boot. His response: \"We don't have any more grilled chicken.\" They didn't run out of chicken- they decided not to grill any more chicken. I know this because when I asked for clarification he pointed to the two cooks in the back, threw them under the bus and told me they weren't making any more.  I would have overlooked my first experience but this is dumb. I'm sitting here now eating my delicious Teriyaki Madness because they are friendly and competent, and the cooks don't decide to stop working an hour-and-a-half before the posted closing time.  Bravo, Cafe Rio",

Every song was alternative favorite of mine; and I am hard pressed to find a place that plays literally one after another of every great alternative song that I love. But more on that in a minute....  Mexican Grill that serves up fresh Mexican fare in the form of burritos, enchiladas, salads and quesadillas.  Had the Pork Barbacoa Burrito and it was excellent!  The pork is on the sweeter side, really fresh and slow cooked in a yummy savory sauce.  Love this rendition so much better than the spicy stuff they serve at Chipotle.  Actually, I would probably choose this place over Chipotle -- the food is just as fresh and has more flavor, and they don't just cake the toppings on.  The staff is awesome too!  They sing and dance and provide a convivial and friendly atmosphere for the patrons.  And did I mention the best part -- the playlist!  This place has a better playlist than most bars and restaurants I've been in -- some Weezer, Everclear, Blink 182, among others alternative favorties, and to top it off -- wait for it -- Journey's Don't Stop Believing! I'm sold on.",

    "text": "Something fell apart here on July 2nd at 8:30p.  While in line, I ordered a fire grilled chicken burrito. The woman tried forcing the other chicken option when I protested she said it'd be 20 minutes for fire grilled chicken. How does that happen? Throwing up my arms- I decided to wait it out. To my left a woman ordered two tacos and was very specific about her order being separated. They botched that. Combining the tacos with one side of salad and rice. Since It turned into a huge line - I went to the checkout and use my full frequent customer card. Instead of checking me out I had to wait 10 minutes with two other livid customers. One of which had been waiting some time for napkins to be refilled and another fuming that he didn't get his desert for his son. What a mess. Needless to say, I paid and picked up my disaster of a burrito - over-packed with fire-grilled chicken and ripped in 3 places. Except they were convinced I hadn't paid yet. Had to present my receipt for that.   With their kitschy slogan  \"every meal a masterpiece\" this was a charlatan's Jackson Pollock. Won't be back.",

Anytime I go in there we wait. And wait. And wait. Then usually they are out of something. Either some meat, guac, or dressing. Or all of them! Drives me crazy that a group of staff members (which they are usually looking fully staffed) can't stay up on everything. And today I even called to place an order. 30 minute wait. Even my fresh cooked Thai food and my fav restaurant is ready in 15 minutes. Anyways, the food gets the stars. Definitely not the service.",

The food is really filling and always makes my mouth water at the very thought of it. And I love getting a free meal after filling up my stamp card.",

The tacos were a soggy messy, the girl slopped salsa on the tacos not even attempting to drain the excess liquid, it was basically taco soup, disgusting.
