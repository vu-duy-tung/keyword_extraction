We asked for plates but never received them so I ended up eating in a mini soy sauce dipping saucer THE WHOLE TIME. The 2nd round that we ordered was a 35 minute wait for them to tell us they lost our order after they came to check on us twice and said they were making our food. The waiters/waitress' def need to be trained more. They were friendly but, their knowledge on their items need some improving and customer service skills as well. They were having a grand opening special for AYCE & Drink specials until friday. BUT THEY WON'T HAVE ALCOHOL UNTIL NEXT WEEK?!? I guess there won't be any drink specials #sadlife. I will say, we did damage. 11$ AYCE sushi for 2 hours. I will def be coming back for the yummy food. Hopefully next time, they will have more staff.",

    "text": "Every time the wifey and I dine here, I always forget to take pics of my beautiful, aesthetically pleasing high quality nigiri sushi lol.  This place definitely deserves my 5 stars because every time we go here the same two servers know who we are and we've been here so much we actually had the opportunity to obtain a FREE ayce sushi dine in after the 10th stamp (they stamped twice every time her & I dined in for ayce).  The service is 5/5, the same Hispanic gentleman and the same Korean gentleman both remember us each time we come in and their service is always friendly and very VERY attentive.  Their nigiri is the perfect fish-to-rice ratio meaning the slices of fish are pretty large, and the rice portion is very small. *Exactly how I like my nigiri sushi.    All the orders always come in so quick! The place is very clean and pretty bright.  And you get surprised upon walking in when every employee greets you loudly in what appears to be in Japanese (don't quote me on that).  We both love this spot, and we will continue to go since it's not much far from where we live.  Thank you guys as always Gorilla Sushi!",

Ambiance is loud and lively. They close late, 2 am, so you can always catch a late night crave. The fact that it's off the strip makes the prices reasonable and the service quick and friendly. Def the best sushi spot in town!",

    "text": "SERVICE: Sally was our server. She was great. She was very attentive and very patient with us. My friends and I are piggies, so we kept on ordering a ton of food. Food also came out pretty quickly. Overall, service was quite excellent.   FOOD: I've had AYCE sushi all over the valley. Woth that being said, this is one of the best places I've ever eaten at. Where do I start??   Appetizers - we ordered shumai (steamed), fried soft shell crab, corn cheese, baked mussels, takoyaki, shrimp tempura, bulgogu, gorilla hot dog, spicy fried chicken, and pork belly. All of our appetizers tasted very good, except the bulgogi was a bit on the tough side.   Sushi - we had the following nigiri: garlic tuna, yuzu yellowtail, smelt roe, flying fish roe, and sexy salmon. On to the rolls: spicy yellowtail roll, gorilla dream, gorilla special handroll, hawaiian roll, lobster roll, mexican Fiesta roll, and Jay roll.  The fish to rice ratio on the nigiri was phenomenal. You get a huge piece of fish and a small ball of rice. The garlic tuna and yuzu yellowtail was out of bounds good!! All of the rolls tasted good as well, but the nigiri were the star of the show!!   Dessert - green tea cheese cake and a snowflake. Green tea cheesecake was so good!!   I will definitely be back and highly recommend this place to everyone.",

What happened to the art in cooking! He was more worried about drinking his beer than serving the food the correct way!

    "text": "I had heard about this place a long time ago and kept passing it by while driving for various ride share jobs ;-). I finally got to try this place on a Sunday Night with my wife just a couple days ago.  With that said here is my only complaint: The benches that you sit on are not padded so not very comfortable. I'm guessing they do this to make sure people stick to the 90 minute dining rule lol.   Now, my praise: J.B. was one of the friendliest  and funniest servers we've ever experienced in a restaurant. He joked around and laughed with us like we were just eating in his house. We ordered \"The Boom Boom\" and right after the song \"Boom Boom\" came on and he came over and pointed it out and then just laughed about it! LOL  The names on some of the sushi dishes had me cracking up! Viagra, Who's Your Daddy, Who's Your Ex-Wife, Taste Like My Ex-Girlfriend and on and on. SO MANY TO CHOOSE FROM!!!! The ones we had were so awesome! The sauce that they put on many of the dishes was making me melt in my not so comfortable seat. I don't know what kind of sauce it was but it was brown and drizzled on a lot of different dishes. I had The Baked Gorilla, Surf & Turf (Highly recommend), Who's Your Ex-Wife (Deep fried spicy tuna, spicy crab mix in a jalapeno w/spicy mayo & eel sauce) OHHHHH EMMMMMM GEEEEEEE!!!!!!! SOOOOOOOO FRICKEN GOOD!!!! I think it was that eel sauce that I couldn't get enough of! If you like spicy you have to get the \"Who's Your Ex Wife\"! but lete it sit for a minute because they bake it and it comes to your table HOT as in temperature hot, not just spicy hot.  This isn't a fancy spot but they have very nice and friendly servers and the food is good. K-Pop is playing on the TV and the place is clean! If you love sushi you HAVE to try Gorilla Sushi! I'm definitely going back...but not too often. I need to lose some damn weight!",

There is a time limit on your eating so they can take forever and you will eventually give up waiting around. Sashimi was tough like it has been sitting out...scary.  sushi rolls were WET!!!  SO WET THEY WERE DRIPPING!!!  This is unacceptable.  When we did order other items on menu that seems very good, they would come back in 10 min and say sorry..we are all out of that.  Lol!!!  Pathetic!  So we gave up on sushi so we ordered udon and other noodle dish.  IT NEVER CAME OUT!!!  yes we have up.  Then we decided we have had enough so we asked for the dessert (ice cream bar).   This came with our meal but that took forever too then we really had to ask the server if we could get the ice cream with 15 min.  PLEASE, AVOID THIS PLACE IF YOU'RE SMART.",

So I hope they see this and bring the service down a notch because they're doing well, being attentive and clean. We just wanted a more chill vibe and space to eat and talk.

The foods of particular note were: the kalbi (which I requested to cook longer than normal to make the fat crispy), unagi nigiri (which I again requested for them to broil longer than normal to make the edges crispy), uni, and sweet shrimp.  Staff was really friendly and made the dining experience memorable.  Will be back.",

I was actually suprised at this dish because I usually enjoy it but I've never gotten it from a Japanese restaurant. The second time I got the crunch rolls, teriyaki chicken, and green tea ice cream. I thought the rolls were average and the teriyaki chicken not so good. The teriyaki didn't have enough sauce and was bland. I enjoyed the green tea ice cream but I had to go back for it because the server forgot to charge me for it and just omitted it from my order. I didn't know that I didn't pay because the bill was high enough! If you do decide to try it make sure you have all of your items before leaving since other reviewers have had a similar experience.

    "text": "Gorilla sushi is one of the best AYCE's ever! They do a great job acknowledging you by cheering when you walk in and walk out. Also, they are more than just sushi. They have other soups, ramen, seafood, etc. There is so many variety that it takes 2 menus to cover all that they have. Some of the menu items however, are only one time order per person like the oysters, which I highly recommend by the way. If you like a spice and raw oyster combination then it's delicious! I would say just order it anyways but they will charge for leftovers. When ordering the sushi, try to aim for half orders so that you can try a little bit of each rolls that sound interesting. That way you can find the roll that best fits you! The menu even suggests it too! My favorite roll was the Tropicana. It had a great crunch for breakfast, dinner and lunch! Haha. All the desserts are also one time orders so make that one count. Anyways service was top notch!! I have never seen service quite like this, they do a great job being on top of everything! Shout out to JB too he was one of the servers that did a lot for us, but they were all great.",

    "text": "So I found this place through several IG posts that were definitely drool worthy, which prompted me to immediately bookmark this establishment and find the time to schedule a visit. New Years Day was the decided day and time so here goes my review:  Food: Probably the biggest and diverse AYCE sushi menu I've ever seen. Not only will you find Japanese food, but also Korean dishes. Since Korean food is definitely in my top 5 of cuisines, I couldn't help but want some of their appetizers. Of the Korean dishes, we ordered the corn cheese and rice cakes wrapped in bacon. We also ordered the baked mussels (which is a must for ayce) and their tomato roll, which for some reason is only offered one time during your visit (this really should be on the ayce menu along with the other specialty rolls). We ordered so many nigiri and rolls (we ordered all together 27+ items!). What was great was that you're also able to order half orders of rolls, which made it easy to try almost everything to our heart's desire. Overall the fish were fresh, the portion of rice in the nigiri was perfect, and we tried interesting and unique rolls. Did you know they have rolls with banana? That was too unique for me so we didn't order any of that. But the fact they offer that is really cool.   Environment/Ambiance: A small joint in a plaza that's easy to miss. It's a small place, but great for small groups and a lot of counter seating. Not much lighting, but that's okay. There's a number of televisions that are either news, movies, or even music videos (a good mix of american pop and k-pop).   Service: On New Years Day there wasn't that many people out. Not sure if everyone was still waking up from the night before. But we were one of the few groups, so we were promptly helped and tended to constantly. One interesting thing is that to order your rounds, there's no paper to mark things down with. A waiter will come and take your order per round so be ready with what you wanted to try in mind. Their menu offers pictures and for the rolls a description. I actually had to write our orders on my phone to keep track. Whenever we finished plates they were quick to clear our table. Sometimes a little too quick. And sometimes the food came out too quick (although I was hungry and this isn't really a complaint).   Tips: Try some rolls you may have not seen before! And take advantage of ordering half orders so you can try everything! Also be prepared to write down your orders.   Will I be back? For sure.",

I've been here 3 times now and every time were here, we can't even enjoy our company because every minute someone is bugging us trying to get plates out of the way. Normally that's a great thing but this is so extreme that I haven't even put the food in my mouth before the staff is reaching for the empty plate ..ugh. So annoying and ruins the experience for us Everytime . I don't know if they're trained that way or not but they should chill out a little. After all, if we're done with the plate we'll put it at the end of the table.",

The music was extremely loud and whenever someone came into the restaurant the staff yelled a greeting, not like I'm used to at many sushi places, but YELLED. It was so loud that I'm not sure I'll go back, despite the food itself being very good and offering great variety, they had a lot of unique rolls here that I would love to eat again but for myself and several others the noise was a source of anxiety.",

    "text": "I found about about this place through a instagram foodie that I follow so me and my BF decided to go give it a try especially because we were super hungry after our long drive from San Diego and this place does AYCE. We came in around 8:30-9 and didn't have to wait at all.   You step in the door and you're greeted enthusiastically right away by the ENTIRE staff and throughout your meal, the staff is nothing short of friendly and is always there to provide great service. We're given the menu and there's just so much to try! On top of all the sushi, they have ramen, udon, Korean fares, etc all a part of their AYCE (wow, right?!).  Everything was delicious and though the cuts of fish for nigiri and sashimi are small, it's all you can eat so you can always order more (sashimi along with a few other things are limited to one order per person though). I wish I could have tried more, but my stomach can only handle so much food... haha. I recommend ordering half rolls, so you can try more variety! At the end, each person also gets to choose one dessert as a part of the AYCE deal. We also got a bottle of fruit soju for only $10! What a deal! and it was delicious (tasted like juice! Which can be dangerous, haha)  They have multiple TVs on both sides of the restaurant with sports, game streaming, and music videos.   Overall, we loved our experience and definitely want to come back when we're in Vegas again. Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "Unfortunately, my time at Gorilla Sushi was quite poor. I enjoyed what food I got, but the amount of time we waited, and the fact they ran out of: Salmon, Kalbi, Uni, Sweet Shrimp, Tempura Ice Cream, Salmon Collar, and Unagi were simply unacceptable even in a soft opening situation. We spent 3.5 hours here, the first full hour of which no sushi dishes came out. The staff was apologetic and I didn't really feel any need to blame them, but there aren't enough sushi chefs and they don't apparently work particularly fast. Another problem is that there are only 3 working during a full dinner evening. They have a lengthy sushi bar, and the fact that they have to take sushi orders from patrons at the bar while falling dramatically behind is flawed.  We made 4 orders on the night. None of them were ever completely filled. The 2nd order came out almost fully before the 1st, and the 1st basically never got filled at all, except for a couple of the rolls. We tried to reorder most of it in the 3rd but by then all the salmon was gone. That meant the three orders of salmon sashimi, five orders of salmon, and three salmon hand rolls *that we had ordered at 7:15pm* never came out. This is probably 9pm by now. And soon after that, they had run out of another 3 common items. We were never informed that they didn't have uni, but I don't think they ever had that, nor the sweet shrimp.  Still, the staff made an effort to apologize and their hands were clearly tied since they simply had run out of stuff. But to run out of Salmon and Unagi at a sushi restaurant? Pretty bad supply management.  As for things that were good - the sushi rice has a decent flavor. The fish quality was adequate to good for an AYCE. While nothing to rave about, their cooked dishes were okay to good. In fact, cooked dishes and ice cream were extremely prompt in delivery. Just not the sushi. And considering the relatively attentive service, I settled on two stars rather than one.  I'm sure they'll iron out the details but I'm not sure we found anything unique or enticing enough to return. The promo they are running during the first week does make it so you'll always get value out of the promo, but not if you include the time invested.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I was really excited to come to this place due to the half off promotion they were having for their opening week.   My group arrived at 5pm expecting some kind of wait only to be greeted with a sign that said \"reopening at 630pm\" which forced us to find something else to do for another hour and a half which we didn't mind because we understood that the might have needed some time to replenish for the next crowd.  My group of 8 were the first to be seated at 630pm, all starving and ready to eat AYCE sushi. The waitress immediately served us drinks and grabbed our first order. Seemed like a good start!   The first round came out after 30 mins consisting of 3 rolls and about 15 orders of appetizers. 10 mins after demolishing that, we ordered again, then another 42 mins for the second order. So far still good considering how many people were there.   AND THEN ... close to an hour later, the waitress comes back and says that our third and fourth orders were coming. 20 mins after that, still nothing. I think they completely forgot about our orders! To my friends annoyance,  he asked her again if the food was even coming and when she came back after checking on it and said \"almost\". He just asked for the check so my group can leave. The only time someone would come to our table was to give us more water and more napkins (which we didn't need because we weren't eating anything).   We were in there a total of 3+ hours and I don't think I even ate a whole roll of sushi because we were all sharing the ones that came to our table. Despite their cheap prices, they were clearly understaffed for this promotion and their service was slow. It almost seemed like they didn't expect to be busy. I definitely would have been more understanding if the staff were ALL busy but I saw some hanging around this podium and just waiting for people to make eye contact with them. No sense of urgency for a place that was so busy.   As for the food, order the Starbux roll. That was the only one I liked because that was the only one I got to taste.",

Their color scheme was black and light colored wood. There was plenty of seating, mostly booths which I liked and a nice little bar you can sit at. Service was great! Everything came out to us pretty fast and we were getting checked up on every now and then. They were not hoovering over us and they weren't ignoring us either.   The sushi was good. We like getting a lot of the cooked rolls to be honest, they were good rolls, but they were somewhat drenched in the eel sauce. Don't get me wrong, eel sauce is good.. but I don't like my rolls swimming in it :( The appetizer selection was huge, I liked the different variations of cucumber salads they had. I also enjoy having a sushi menu that has symbols for spicy sushi rolls and symbols for raw sushi. It makes picking out food so much easier! I might be back here again, depending if I am around that side of town! This place is worth trying out though! :)",

Big fat pieces of cucumber and tiny little pieces of tasteless fish covered with semi dry rice is what you get. I got the AYCE option and my husband got the ramen. There is an added cost for food wastage but I just could not finish my plate. Three servers came and asked us what we wanted to start with and the 4th server still got the order wrong. The music here is tasteless and so loud, you cannot have a conversation over it. It took me 25 mins to eat my food and my husband's ramen never showed up. When we asked for the ramen order to be canceled, we were asked if we were sure because they were already working on the order. I've never had to wait that long before for ramen. That is usually the first item to be served. They didn't add that to the bill nor did they add the extra charge for the sushi I sent back. So that was nice of them I guess. Definitely not coming back here.",

Fish was very fresh, presentation and fish/rice/topping/sauce ratios were perfect. Rolls weren't packed with rice like a lot of other sushi buffet places do. Also little to no AYCE restrictions with the whole menu. The sushi chef noticed we were ordering a lot of nigiri and sent yellowfin toro to our table! What a nice touch!!!! Wait staff was very attentive and pleasant, and the owner stopped by our table to greet us towards the end of the meal. 100% would recommend to a friend and will return next time in LV!",

Unexpectedly returned in April 2017 and was pleasantly surprised with great sushi as a result of a new head chef.   Great service, fair pricing, and now, great food. Located in an old area, but inside a clean environment.   Seafood is fresh and tasted of great quality. Enjoyed the sashimi, nigiri, hot foods, salads and appetizers much! Salmon, tuna, oysters, yellow-tail, halibut, salmon roe, Cajun albacore, mackerel, eel, sweet shrimp, kalbi, pork belly, tempura, Cucumber salad, sea urchin to name some of my orders that I thoroughly enjoyed.   Additionally offered is Korean comfort foods available for late night take out until 2am. Great selection that I look forward to experiencing.   Recommended to anyone who may have had a poor experience once before, like me. Give it another shot. Also recommended to anyone who enjoys AYCE sushi or desires Korean comfort food for late night pick up.",

The service was a little lacking more specifically because I was being forced to tip 18%.   I brought this to the Management's attention but they were pretty stubborn about the policy.  Sorry Gorilla looks like I have to leave you a bad review. Ariel our waiter was kinda nice guy though.   It's too bad I couldn't on principle tip him more then 18%",

    "text": "I come here with my best friend all the time, since the place has opened. It quickly became our favorite sushi places. We decided we wanted to get something to eat and we were both craving sushi so we came to Gorilla. We were seated at our table and we noticed we waited an exceptionally longer time to order drinks or appetizers than usual. We kind of got a little irritated, as the restaurant wasn't as busy as any other time, but no biggie. What really caught our eye though is how much the busser/server girl continued staring us down. We knew that she was just looking to see if we had any extra plates in our way that she can take, but over the course of our meal, what would have been considered excellent service just became super uncomfortable. This girl kept her eyes locked on us at almost ALL times. She walked around our table and stared down at us and at our food. My friend and I both whispered to each other that we felt like we were being judged. We were both sharing AYCE, so it wasn't like we were being watched to make sure one of us who was have AYCE was sharing with someone who was eating a la carte. I mean this girl stared us down even when we had no chance of having any plates taken away. She went up and down the aisle an circles our table like a hawk. Just. Staring. What was most unsettling is the fact that she would stop at the side of our table and just stand there, staring down at us for no damn reason. This went on for an hour. My friend and I both agreed we lost our appetite. I finally got tired of it and we had a tiny plate in between us so it would be easier for me to put the sushi on it to share, and the girl came over to take it and I said \"Can I keep this actually?\" And the girl looked at me wide eyed, then gave me a nasty look with her hands up in the air, and backed up without saying anything, then walked away. Idk what I did to deserve that, I asked nicely despite how angry I was getting. I used to really like the service but I don't know what happened. I don't know if there's new management telling the busser/servers to do that, if so it's very creepy and really can ruin people's appetites. I hate to say I don't know if we'll be back.....",

    "text": "Yikes! This place is not for people like me.  I'm a big fan of Nigiri Sushi, and what most people don't know is that sushi is the art of eating rice.  The fish is just the condiment. The rice is called the Shari and the fish is the Neta.  Fish needs to be cross grain so the texture is correct. This place cuts their fish at random.  I got a double order of lengthwise tuna and was very hard to chew.  Which sounds ridiculous because Tuna should melt.  They do not put any wasabi between the Shari and Neta like traditional Edo method, but then again, most places don't.    The wife and I came here as opposed to our usual spot of sushi king because they had an interesting menu of 1time order items.  The surf and turf were not great, cheap steak and baby shrimp. The chicken wings were awful and dry and battered. The calamari tempura was like a greasy onion ring. The Smoked salmon Nigiri was an actual piece of nova scotia lox. LOL WTF?  You're not supposed to use a literal piece of supermarket lox. The Bossam was microwaved when the pork should be served, room temp. The amaebi was not real, just dry basic shrimp butterflied.  Real amaebi should be gooey.  Plus you only get one piece per order even though their menu photos shows two. Doesn't matter, it tasted bad anyways. The sashimi salad you can tell was pre-made and refrigerated because it was slightly frozen.   The rolls were not as great as the rice had too much pressure applied to the rice looked pasty.  It tasted like sushi bought at Smith's I am certain, not much time is spent on their sushi rice.  So I cannot recommend their rolls nor nigiri.  The plus side, they have a great atmosphere and great drink deals, Buy one get one beer and sakes, etc.  However, I'm not much of a drinker anymore in my 40's and neither is my wife so it's not for us.  It's still a fun place to go with friends and get loud. The service is decent,  but if you're strictly here as a foodie like myself.  There are better sushi joints.",

They were so on top of it. I usually order and wait 5-10 minutes between the orders to get everything. Here it was almost instantly! Another great thing about Gorilla is that the server got about 95% of our order correct, meaning they only missed about 2 orders total! That's such good accuracy seeing how our party was a party of 8.  As for the sushi we loved it. For the price you pay you get pretty decent quality. Their sashimi was surprisingly fresh. Being in the middle of the desert, I didn't expect much. I got some good fish. It definitely wasn't the best but pretty good for AYCE. Their rolls tasted great and not cheap at all. Their nigiri has a perfect ratio. There wasn't an excess amount of rice compared to fish. The rice however didn't taste like sushi rice. I think they might have forgotten to put rice wine vinegar with it but it was okay.",

    "text": "Pretty decent nigiri sushi and sushi rolls, especially if you get the all-you-can-eat option and time everything diligently. When I stopped by recently at the beginning of the day, there was a 1-hour time limit on the AYCE, which wasn't a problem as I ordered about 3 items at a time and put in my requests for the next round while I ate.  As for the nigiri sushi, standard items like the salmon, red snapper, eel, smelt roe, and \"yum yum scallop\" were fairly fresh and tasty. They came in somewhat petite portions, which might be cause for concern on an a la carte basis, but I didn't mind since I was doing the AYCE.  There's also a huge roster of goopy, calorific \"special\" rolls, baked rolls, and fried rolls to choose from. If you're somewhat diet-conscious (not likely if you're doing the AYCE), or if you're just pacing yourself, you can try many of these in half-rolls. Some are whimsically named, like the \"I Love My A**\" roll and the \"Tastes Like My Ex-Girlfriend\" roll, and all were quite satisfying as I'd skipped breakfast before coming here.  If you haven't already stuffed yourself full of fish, rice, and sauces, there's also a good selection of hot and cold apps that you can choose from for the AYCE. The ikayaki, pork belly, and tonkatsu with rice helped fill me up. As place is owned by Korean-Americans (in particular, the hostess appeared to be an owner or manager and was incredibly lively and sweet), you'll also see items like japchae, Korean spicy rice cake, and bulgogi on the menu.  What's more, they have booze specials too. I enjoyed the soju cocktails, which were such a deliciously fruity way to imbibe my booze, and went down well with everything I was eating. All in all, a great find thanks to all you Yelpers out there!",

But if I were to choose, I would not choose this place at any way if you ever been to Yama or Sakana Sushi before and have such expectations. For instance, I ordered three random baked sushi and all of them were almost identical with 50% imitation crab and 30% rice.   What upset me most was our server. The server, J.B, was so funny, we forgot to laugh! He either must be very disrespectful in nature or no sense of mannerism, or both. Thanks for making us uncomfortable tonight.

This is a contrast to the neighborhood which is a bit on the sketchy side (Eastside of Las Vegas).  We made it out alive, so it's not that bad.  For $26, it's a few dollars more than it's AYCE peers.  Is it worth it?  There is nothing to complain about the sushi, a good rice to fish ratio, precise cuts and fish is of decent quality.  The sashimi is limited to one serving per person and it's worth it, it's a much higher grade than anticipated.  Service is pretty good, with consistent check ins to make sure we placed our orders.  The honey toast was a downer, it's just a sweet bread roll that is slightly toasted with some honey and a scoop of ice cream.  Stick with the ice cream instead  The verdict, I would say it's worth just on the sashimi itself.",

The Who's your Ex-wife roll is killer, they don't skimp in the jalapenos and that's one of the best parts!   The Gorilla special hand roll is so good we get two every time we are in there! If you add cream cheese it just kicks it up a notch.(foodie reference)   The service is great, the last time we went they were pretty busy so we can't hold that against them. They are attentive and always there when you need something.   The interior of this place is great; the decor is modern and clean which is always a plus.   Bathrooms are clean.   We will be regulars here from now on.",

You can also 1/2 a roll which is nice if you want try new rolls.   The rice is cooked perfectly.  The miso soup isn't too salty. The sashimi salad had ample fresh fish.  The service was excellent and I was immediately seated and served on a Friday night.   When I'm in Vegas and craving sushi this is my new go to location.  It's definitely worth a visit.",

The uni was the best I've had in a very long time and most definitely best uni in a ayce spot. All rolls were pretty diverse and weren't basically the same thing. I was overall very impressed. Also the customer service was awesome, super friendly and didn't have that fake vibe, actually seemed like some cool people.",

Came in for lunch (all you can eat is $19.99 and yes that's what we got) & I really liked how some of the sushi rolls were served in 4pcs so that you have more room to try everything. They had exotic sushi rolls like \"Monkey Banana\" (California on top of a fried banana) and \"Star Bucks\" that were reallly tasty!! Honestly everything we tried was super good (and I could be a picky eater sometimes)   Also the presentation for each plate was very nice. You can tell they put a lot of love and pride in their food. The owner even asked us which rolls stood out to us the most after munching down.   We'll definitely be back :)",

The fish does not smell but portions are small, sushi is not wrapped tightly and there is very little presentation. No sauces on or near rolls. No garnishes or presentation. Host is not rude but acts indifferently. Music too loud from all the tv's. Atmosphere is good if you are 20 years old. It's like a restaurant that really wants to be a concert Hall. I guess what I hoped for was good food and a traditional Japanese atmosphere. I ate 3 rolls but left disappointed and dissatisfied.",

    "text": "Stumbled across this on yelp and decided to give it a shot. I'm a very big fan of sushi and sometimes I get bored of my same haunts. I was surprised I had never heard of this location, even though I literally lived a mile down the road for 2 years. The good thing is that the place has an amazing ambiance. Slightly dimmed lights gave it that quiet hangout feel which is awesome. I loved the multiple tv's tuned to different stations. 1 was the knight's playoff game, 1 was an E-league match, 1 was baseball, and 1 was a youtube playlist which coincidentally was their source of overhead music. The exact same 4 screens(in backwards order haha) on the opposite wall so everyone can catch whatever no matter where they sit. I love that. The table was clean, and food was tasty. If it had ended there, this place would have been perfect. The 1 fault I had was that there were 5, yes 5 wait staff who work the entire floor. Meaning every. single. 15. seconds. we were hit up with the regular, everything ok? doing alright? everything good? anything else? more drink? Anywhere else with less intensity it would have been a really great thing, but it actually ruined the meal. Pretty much every single bite or sip someone popped up to interrupt us. Dinner conversation? Not likely..... I really REALLY wanna give them the benefit of the doubt and just say ok, the place was mostly empty, which it was, they were a tad over staffed for the hour we were there, everyone was bored and trying to make themselves useful. I really want that to be the case, because they were all super polite and helpful with any questions we had, seriously much love to JD and the rest of them, but my mother was seriously annoyed and I can never bring her back here. I would definitely recommend this place, as I know for a fact it's the best sushi place in it's zip code. Nowhere within 4-5 miles that's as good quality and as comfortable as this place. But for family sushi night? I must resign myself elsewhere.",

Other AYCE sushi places I've tried seem to use rice that tastes thick and sticky so it overfills you too quickly, even when there appears to be minimal rice on the roll. Also, the servers are extremely attentive to refill water, bring your food, and remove empty plates. The non-sushi items are all delicious and worth trying too. There's a 90 minute time limit (more than enough time for me) and half rolls are allowed. I think Gorilla Sushi is one of the best AYCE sushi for value and quality on the East side of Vegas, so don't be afraid to drive to this older side of the city if you want to experience some exceptional sushi and service!",

    "text": "Wanted to have some sushi buffet, and after looking at a lot of menus from other places, I decided on this one. We came with a party of 6, so we wanted variety for everybody's taste.   There are many special items that can only be ordered once, but they're pretty good portions. The uni came with 2 pieces per order. Nice and creamy. The shrimp came with 2 pieces, the fried head was sooo fresh and good. The sushi was perfect one bite.   We tried many different rolls, they were all created with heart. The only downside is the rolls takes a long time to come. The sushi in general took a long time. They need more sushi chefs. We got most of our order, and was told we still have like 6 rolls left. Kinda sucks because you want to eat the roll when you're most hungry to enjoy the taste.   The sashimi allowed per person was great, I couldn't find another place that offered sashimi except here. They were cut really thinly. And we asked for a couple with no sauce to taste the freshness. It was great!   The rock and roll was good, rice less and refreshing.  Sashimi nachos was good, crispy with nice cold sashimi and sauce.   Was really full near the end but still got some ice cream and mochi in the tummy.  The party was really impressed since this is their first Japanese buffet in Las Vegas. The server was nice and friendly. Had to keep coming around so we could order again. Waters were topped up.",

Ordered: I LOVE MY ASS, popcorn lobster, catepillar, kbbq, bonsai, crunch roll, unagi nigiri, Cajun albacore nigiri, house salad, garlic edemame, bulgogi nachos, fried calamari, shumai and to finish off green tea fried ice cream and Affogato.  Menu full of options, but lacked variety. Rolls seem to blend with one another and felt like the same base rolls with different toppings. We were the only ones in there for awhile before a second group showed up. To be fair, EDC was in town so I won't judge and server said it was busy earlier. I did open my pallet to crab so there's that.   Servers Jay and Leo were on top of their game and really made the difference between 3 and 4 stars.   AYCE $24.95 dinner. HALF ORDERS available for 8pc chef specials. Plenty of appetizers in small portions.",

For one it tastes like it's not fresh and so i can't eat it in fear that I'll get food poisoning. Next, I asked for eel sauce, spicy mayo, and a spicy sauce on top and they sent some mixture of sauces in a container. I do not detect any eel sauce in whatever this concoction is which is literally my favorite part so they don't even follow requests it seems. I waited all morning for a sushi place to open so I could fix my craving and now I'm out $20 and with nothing to eat.",

The sushi came fast and was of great flavor.  Appetizers were not so good, calamari and mussels were a little to rubbery for us.  Wasn't a fan of the cucumber and imitation crab meat salad when generally that's our favorite. The mochi ice cream was a little defrosted and had an old taste.  The tables were uncovered and wood with some kind of coating that not sealed and makes the table top appear to look a bit greasy dirty.  I'm assuming this is because of the quick turn around that they have since its not a very large location.  UNLV students get a discount with id on all you can eat and a party of four birthday person get a free all you can eat with id.  Sushi was good and service was good.  Just need to work a couple of things.",

I'm glad we started with a small order, because I didn't want to order any after that. I also love love the way the season their oysters, I'll def be returning some day esp bc they have amazing bogo drink deals when you get AYCE, and free AYCE on your bday.

I'd driven by here several times and hadn't taken notice, but she invited me for an early dinner and we were both pretty impressed!  Location is clean, service from Austin was super friendly, but more importantly, the fish was hella fresh! The apps alone were worth it for me, with ample starter portions of one-limit items like sashimi salad rather than a couple of tablespoons in a tiny bowl. They also offer a couple of dinner-only sashimi options. The poke and salad were solid, but the seafood nachos and stuffed tomato (crab + avocado wrapped in tuna) were better. Their version of the classic riceless Rock N Roll was better than almost any other version I've tried. I did not partake but their dessert menu is larger than other AYCE options, which is a plus.  I will be coming back- apps and rolls are extensive, but they stand out with their fresh and thick cuts of fish.",

Me, my wife and 8 year old daughter came here for lunch around noon. The place was empty the whole time we were there. Now the service was ok. Our waitress was attentive but forgot a few items that we ordered. Usually that would annoy me but the food was so bad I was actually thankful of her forgetfulness. Majority of the Nigiri we ordered the fish tasted bitter. Not exactly the flavor profile I would expect from raw fish. The Uni was very dark that left a bad taste in my mouth even after several helpings of ginger.... And I hate ginger with a passion. So to use that to cleanse my palette is saying a lot. I cannot convey my dissatisfaction of Gorilla Sushi because words haven't been created in the English language that would equal my feelings of disgust....",

The price is the same compared to other competitors. There are a variety of sushi rolls. Most places have the same ingredients for their rolls but they change the names with different sauces but Gorilla Sushi is very original. Would definitely come back for their fresh sushi and great service.",

    "text": "Alright this review is averaging 7 visits.  Averaging all the times I have been there I would say the sushi is 5 stars A+ the Sushi Chefs always smile and never look grumpy I think they truly enjoy their jobs.  They get 4 stars for service because there has been times where we would have to wave for the wait staff or they actually brought the wrong order over it ordered it wrong from the start.  Timeliness is 4 stars because anything made from the back kitchen is slow.  I will say staff and what appears to be the manager is super friendly!  My biggest pet peeve is this-  they show videos on the tv but it's sometimes inappropriate videos and all of it is in English or Spanish - I would much rather see Asian singers such as KPop or even movies then what they have now the second pet peeve is how uncomfortable the booths are I know some places do that so people don't stay long but seriously? My mom has a back problem and literally couldn't sit for more then half hour and left hungry",

One thing I was also impressed with is , with the AYCE , appetizers are included ! I'm not a big eater , but this made it worth it for me !",

I have eaten in a lot of AYCE sushi restaurants and I believe that Gorilla Sushi is good but is still lacking.  Food: The sushi was good in terms of flavor but I would sometimes get sushi that was dry and not cold enough. Don't get me wrong but isn't fresh, raw fish supposed to cold? Yes, it is. The sushi that I got was warm. Consistency is definitely the key. Other than that, there are a lot of different sushi to choose from and some of them are really good such as the Red Snapper and the dragon roll.   Service: The service was really good. The servers were really nice and catered to our needs well. I didn't even have to ask for a refill once when I needed one. They are all very kind.  Overall, I left this restaurant with a good impression but not a great one. I understand that they are still new and have a lot of improvements to be made. It was still worth a try and I would definitely come back if I'm in the area and need a sushi fix fast.",

They also offer a few rolls without rice (I really enjoyed the Rock & Roll), as well as some sashimi, which is rare for all-you-can-eat sushi joints. Everything we've tried has been delicious. Give Gorilla a try next time you're out for sushi.",

We could've have just left then but we felt obligated and stuck so we ordered anyway. No teasers (edamame or cucumber salad) and no offer of ginger/wasabi (#4) Rolls were OKAY. Sushi chef was awkward but really nice and owner was a helicopter in a creepy way. We left with our fingers crossed to not have food poisoning. We were just fine but that's not really what you want to have to be hoping for after 3 rolls and a $40 bill. Not good enough to return.",

It taste sooo good, come and try it.",

Some of the rolls were a little messy but they were very busy so I understand. The wait was around 30 minutes and it was a little annoying because there's not much waiting space inside so we had to wait outside, in the heat, for most of the time. The service from our waitress was not great because we would have to wait so long for her to take our order for more rolls, but she was nice and it was understandable because of the amount of people she was helping. Overall I liked the food and the service was okay, but I think it will get better with time and when they're less busy.",

The manager even asked if we would like to switch tables because they had the space and she was worried that the sun would be in our eyes.

When the waiter came by I said hey can I get rice for my son for his chicken katsu and he said yes---the rice came instantly but no katsu. It took over an hour for it to come and when it came it had rice with it. I told the waiter, well he didn't touch this bowl of rice waiting, I told you I wanted a bowl of rice to go with the katsu...and you didn't say it came with. And he said oh yeah it comes with. Well ok. Thanks for mentioning that when I asked for it to go with it and thanks for putting it on my bill.  Service lacks for the place being completely empty. Most rolls were good but I can find other places that are better.",

    "text": "We've been to other sushi places, but this is one of my favorites. They have really fresh sushi, they have pretty fast service and the waiters are very attentive.   We came in about 6 pm. When we first came in it didn't take long for them to seat us. About half the tables were full so they weren't too busy. We ordered drinks first, then ordered some appetizers. My favorite appetizer is the takoyaki. My aunty liked the oysters and said they tasted very fresh. Both aunties also liked the calamari. They didn't like that the calamari were rings because when they bit into it the calamari would separate from the outer batter. Aunty thinks if the calamari were cut into strips it would've been better. They also like the taste of the batter.    Anyways, we also liked that they had a couple of sushi rolls that didn't have rice in them (the Rock N Roll & Johnny). They look similar to regular rolls, the difference is that they're wrapped in thinly sliced cucumber instead of nori and they have no rice in them. We enjoyed these and thought they were very refreshing and light.   Hubby liked the uni. It has a nice golden color so you know it's pretty fresh. I tried it, but it's not for me. I like the ikura better. The uni is one of those items that you can only get one per person and it comes as a pair of nigiri. The ikura doesn't have a limit so yay for me!   They have funny names for the sushi rolls like most places do now a days. The Tastes like my Ex-gf is one of those. It's funny because when my hubby ordered it, the waiter, Ian, covered my ears and asked him \"How does she taste?\"  Too funny... That roll was very good and most of the others were delicious too. I liked the ones with scallop on top. I know we tried one with what I believe was baked salmon on the top, but that one wasn't as good.   They also have a small assortment of desserts to choose from. You can only choose one per person, but you'd prob only have enough room at the end for one anyway. lol. This time I tried the honey toast. It looks like those little Hawaiian sweet bread rolls toasted with a little scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and honey drizzled all over. Hubby got the affogato. He liked it but it had a stronger coffee flavor than what we're used to from other places.   The price for dinner was about $26 per person for AYCE. There are some plates that you can only get one per person for the whole meal, but if you have a few people in your party then it doesn't really matter much. The waiters are usually pretty entertaining and friendly. Hubby says it's a place worth standing in line for (although I haven't had to stand in line to wait yet).",

The servers are phenomenal and have such a sense of humor. They were always there to refill waters real quick and take any dishes away. You do have a time limit I believe it's an hour but that's more than enough time. Food was great and they had raw oysters (one time only). I definitely will be coming back whenever I'm in town.

Sushi + Ramen with a Korean twist? Sure, why not! So, we decided to check it out this weekend.  Pros - Nigiri is good...the rice to fish ratio is perfect - There is ramen - More appetizer choices  Cons - Everything is geared towards the sweet side - They use the bad pieces when you order poke and the seafood salad  Service - Service was great. They always had someone taking away the finish plates, refilling your water and even asking if you needed more ginger or wasabi.  Inside - They play very loud music. it's probably the first sushi place I've been to that doesn't play Kpop lol. I don't really care for the type of music they play but hey, I'm here to eat, not to listen. There are open booths throughout. Booths big enough to sit like 8-10 people if you're tiny I guess....lol  Overall Impression The pros/cons is what stood out to us. My bf had a sugar crash right afterwards and I started getting a semi migraine so that is not good. I still want to go back to try their dinner since there are a lot of other options available for dinner only.   I'm not going to say it's the best sushi ever because it's not. Sushi Neko and Hanabi still tops my list.",

There is plenty of parking around the restaurant, which is located in a plaza and is next to 7-Eleven.   They do have Ayce sushi for dinner for $26. I ordered Korean food-  Kalbi, Bulgogi and Pork Belly and they were tasty. I wasn't in the mood for sushi then. I wish I had ordered some sushi.

    "text": "Food great. Waiter great. Flirting happened. Boyfriend jealous ahah.  Our server JB was super friendly and even joked around with us. He definitely made the experience more enjoyable and even recommended what soju drinks to get. All the other servers were equally just as friendly and even joked with us when they brought out the rolls. (You'll understand when you see the sushi roll names)  Loved the names of the sushi rolls and can't really complain about any of the dishes we got. All the fish, raw or cooked, definitely tasted fresh and scrumptious. Portions might be a bit smaller, but definitely don't underestimate how much you order, it'll definitely fill you since a lot of their dishes have rice and their non rice dishes are usually one time orders. And their ACYE isn't just limited to the sushi rolls, nirigi, or sashimi. They also have Korean food and ramen too!   If I lived closer to here or even came back to Vegas, I'd definitely come here again for dinner. (Some of the ACYE dishes are dinner only specials).",

    "text": "Thursday, my husband and I found ourselves in desperate need of a date night.  After going to a movie, he asked me if I wanted to go to dinner, which of course, I said yes.   We pulled up to Gorilla Sushi, and he reminded me that some friends had been raving about this place a while back.    Gorilla Sushi is a bit more on the modern side than other sushi joints we've been to.  Gorilla has several large TVs playing music videos, sports, and other things.  It is open, bright, and well lit.    We were seated right away, and of course, we chose the AYCE option.   I was excited to see that they include some sashimi with AYCE.  It was limited, but I'm totally ok with that.  I'm going to try to recap everything that we ordered:  Sashimi: 3 pieces (each) salmon 3 pieces (each) tuna 3 pieces (each) yellowtail Absolutely wonderful.  The texture and flavor of the fish was phenomenal.  Appetizers: Seaweed salad:  standard.  Delicious Gyoza:  SO. GOOD.  Very different from other gyoza dishes we've had before, this was absolutely incredible.  Garlic Edamame:  Wonderful.  Not greasy, which is always a plus. Screaming Orgasm salad:  One of my favorites of the night.  Delicious.   Nigiri: Let me just say that every single thing we ordered was absolutely delicious.  I might add an additional comment for the ones that were huge standouts, but every single item we ordered was incredible.  We had multiple orders of anything we could get multiple orders of.  (I think the amebi was the only thing we could only get one order of, which was fine.)  Super White: Best in Vegas.  Hands down. Unagi Ebi Amebi:  Absolute perfection. Salmon Smoked Salmon:  OMG.   Garlic Salmon: AMAZING Garlic Tuna Cajun Albacore Halibut Mackerel (not my fav, but better than other spots I've tried) Tako Flying Fish eggs Yuzu Yellowtail  Dessert: Honey Toast:  super cute and small, this was perfect.    Can I talk about the service?  Incredible.  Everyone we interacted with was polite, and very personable.  We received a punch card, too, which is always a plus.  I honestly could not be happier to have found Gorilla...our previous favorite spot has had a slip in quality, so we  are definitely going to make this our new sushi home!!  Thanks to all the staff, and we will see you soon!!!",

Our initial server Sharon had something dropped off to my table that I did not order then got upset and said, \"OMG\" when I told her that is not what I ordered and had the nerve to tell me she repeated it 3x in which she did not! I've been waiting to come to this place for months and I'm just really saddened by my experience. Our next server tried to make it better and I appreciate it but it was downhill from the first waitress.   Luckily we ended up ordering the Surf n Turf roll which tasted ok. But this was by far the worst service and food experience I've had thus far.",

    "text": "One of the best sushi spots I've been to! I've been here twice now and had a great experience on both occasions. Service is stellar! As soon as you walk in, the host/hostess immediately walks up to you and leads you to your table, then a waiter/waitress comes to ask what drink you'd like, and after you order both drinks/food...food starts coming! I love how fast, friendly, and awesome their service is. Also, when they see empty plates on the table, they pick them up almost immediately. They are very attentive and I love that...they refill water without having to flag them down.   Now let's talk about food. I'm all about nigiris! But this place has me eating more than my usual. Nigiris- rice to fish ratio is perfect! Not like most sushi spots, Gorilla give less rice. Their poki salad is delicious! It has a bit of kick to it which I love. Oyster-fresh! Vegetable tempura-mmm so good! Even my 16 month old loved it! I can go on and on but I'd suggest you head on over there to know what I'm talking about! If it's not the food, the service will wow you.",

We tried many different options:   - whose your daddy roll (there was no rice)  - rainbow - crunch (not traditional it had what looked like rice crispies on it)  - spicy hand roll  - spicy crispy garlic chicken (tasted like panda but better)  - tempura shrimp  - Creamy Shrimp (would not recommend)  - Cream Corn   They have half orders and full orders and everything seemed really fresh.

    "text": "Gorilla sushi... Wow... If you love sushi as much as I do, I highly recommend this place when around Las Vegas. There is plenty of parking around the restaurant, which is located in a plaza next to 7-Eleven. The atmosphere is interesting... The interior was decorated with bright colors and reminded me of a typical sushi restaurant. They played Latin music which was fine but a little confusing for a place that specializes in sushi. We had a party of 6 and got seated immediately on a Saturday night (crazy right). It wasn't that busy and our server was really friendly.  Food: The fish was fresh and tasted like any AYCE (all you can eat) sushi place. One thing I liked about this place is that you can order sashimi! Although it's only one order per person, the cuts were quality. The nigiri was pretty good. I recommend the cajun albacore, salmon, unagi, and yellow tail. The salmon skin hand roll was also really tasty.   DO NOT GET THE KOREAN FOOD!!!! We tried the Bossam, Jap Chae, and Dokkbukki... It was all gross and I highly don't recommend it. Stick with the sushi! Trust me!  However, the shrimp tempura was really good! I recommend that as well.  Service: Our server was really nice; Although, I think he mixed up some of orders and gave us more than we asked, which was unsettling. He came by very often to ask if we wanted more food, but when it came to finishing up our check, he was pushy and asked if we were done a couple of times.  4/5  Pros: -Good quality of fish (for AYCE) -Fast and friendly servers -Spacious restaurant -Accommodates big parties -SASHIMI FOR AYCE  Cons: -18% gratuity automatically applied for parties of 6 or more -Gross Korean Food",

I've had the lunch AYCE, the 3-item lunch special twice (as it is near my work location) and now the dinner AYCE.  For both AYCE meals the sushi was very fresh and tasty. the rolls were well packed and professional looking.  They have a very wide selection of items on their menu, which is easy to figure out. I don't think you could try everything without going there at least 10 or so times. My favorite items: for rolls - the MGM (the crispy carrots on top are awesome), the Mexican Beach (really refreshing) and the tastes like your ex-girlfriend (probably does not taste like anyone's ex-girlfriend, but has yummy scallops and warm fried goodness inside)  for nigiri - the mackerel and the garlic tuna.  Mackerel is what I judge most sushi restaurants by...either they get it right or they don't (and they get it right here). My son loves the tacoyaki.    For the lunch special, I have had the dragon roll, sashimi salad, and the garlic chicken, and then the second time I had the rainbow roll, sashimi salad, and ramen.  The rolls and sashimi salad were excellent, and the garlic chicken was good (probably not as good as Fukumimi, but good). The only think I had that was not really good was the ramen.  I would just skip that next time and  probably try the vegetable tempura.  The service is excellent, and I have been seated right away each time.  They have enough seating, which is a big plus when you are on your lunch hour.  For both lunch visits, i was in and out and back to my work about 3/4 mile away easily within my allotted hour. The waiters are very attentive, and the sushi comes out fast.   A dependably excellent experience.",

We came here on a Saturday at 3pm, so it wasnt too busy. There was a good amount of staff. We were seated with 2 menus. We let them know we were first timers, so we needed some time. We didnt want to do the AYCE, so the waiter took 1 of the menus, leaving us with  only 1 menu. Where was the thought in that? So of course my husband and i were passing the menu around trying to figure out what we wanted to order.. We finally ordered,got our drinks, the cups and plates were still dirty. They still had food on them, waiters kept taking things off the table  without giving us a heads up. Customer service was just all wack. Overall this place was just blah. Super sad, cause almost everyone else experince was spot on. Mine, on the hand was blah.. we wont be back.",

If you look at the exterior of the location alone you might miss out on amazing food. So take my advice and never do that. This place was very worth it. Portion sizes were huge and the interior looked great.  Check it out for yourself :)",

It's rare to get sushi servers who take time to make conversation with your party, so the atmosphere was great. As a vegetarian, they have plenty of options that make the AYCE worth it! We will definitely be making the drive over again!  Also, current promotion: if you wear a jersey in on Sundays you get 10% of your AYCE!",

They were both very attentive and took very good care of us. They were always around, made sure we got all rolls that were ordered, and refilled our drinks when needed. Mr. Alex checked on us towards the end of our meal and helped servers running food when they got busier. That says a lot about management. We had many rolls, as there were 4 AYCE, sashimi, garlic edamame, agedashi tofu, and moshi ice cream for desert. The fish were fresh, and the amount of rice on the rolls was appropriate. Everything tasted great, and we'll go back for sure!",

    "text": "I came here at noon on a Saturday for AYCE and because they had just opened it wasn't too busy. Looking at the menu, I immediately saw a couple things (half rolls) I wanted to start of with so I put my order in fairly quickly after I got there but I ended up waiting and waiting. My date got two of his rolls, and still mine didn't come out. There was a couple that got there a good 10-15 minutes after I did and they were brought out 4 orders and still nothing of mine had come out. Finally, it must have been nearly 25 mins until I got my half rolls but the server left so fast I couldn't put in more orders which I wanted to do seeing as it was going to take forever. Also, my date had asked for the miso soup as an appetizer and after 3 rolls and still no miso, we had to ask for it again. 3 times we were brought incorrect rolls and once our roll was almost given to the table next to us and it would have been if we hadn't told the server that was ours. Of course we didn't take the incorrect rolls that were brought to us because we assumed they were someone else's and it wouldn't have been right, even if we were hungry and even if ours were taking forever. There was definitely some sort of miscommunication happening between the kitchen and the servers but the servers were still very nice and attentive of re-filling our drinks and aslo very apologetic when something wasn't right so I don't feel like I can knock them. There was a baked roll that I never got but I was already pretty full so no harm done. Other than this though, the food was really good and they have a lot of unique rolls. We ended up being there for over two hours and most of the time we spent waiting. I wasn't in a hurry so although the food took forever, I was a bit annoyed but not too much. If I had somewhere to be afterwards I would've been livid and probably would have asked for a discount. Maybe they were just having a rough start that day. I would still give this place another shot and try some of their other rolls. Hopefully next time will be better though.",

I enjoyed the food.. if your a sashimi monster like me. I'd recommend trying the sashimi without the sauce. Even tho it was good with it. I prefer plain sashimi =) i also enjoyed having fresh Wasabi too! That made everything awesome.  Honestly, all I eat at ayce places is sashimi [Which is bomb and their nigiri is too!] and ikura with quail egg. If you're a quail egg monster... they do charge $1 per quail egg.. =/ I know alot of my friends love rolls! So I'll definitely bring my friends any family to try this place out!!

We come down here weekly for the all you can eat sushi and chill environment. Our servers have all been personable and attentive, but Austin has been the best by far. I suggest you try the brand new Planet Hollywood roll or the Megabucks roll as they are extremely flavorful. This is a hidden gem just off the strip that I suggest to everyone.",

I'm still sore after losing Min Sok Chon in this location so many years ago, but in all of the incarnations of this business space, the consistent element is friendly, welcoming service. Calling in a pick up order is so quick and easy, and twice when I had questions over menu items, whoever took my order went out of their way to ask the chefs when they weren't 100% sure how to answer my question. That's integrity right there. The menu features lots of over-the-top rolls, but the quality of the fish is not compromised. The prices of basic rolls is obviously a steal; if you are a UNLV student and you don't know about these cheap Cali rolls, you're missing out on life. But I like the Korean dishes that are also available here - don't miss the Scallop Dynomite appetizer, mmmm. One of these days I'll come for the AYCE dinner; they also have a full bar. In the meantime, I love being able to swing in and get great food on the way home at great prices.",

    "text": "So I'm basing this review on a two day experience.  Day 1: The grand opening we were there when they just opened. Our server was Steven and he seemed like a nice guy but often felt like our table was forgotten. We wanted appetizers first to start and we wanted the Hawaiian Kalbi, the pork belly, Gyoza, and bulgogi with rice. We never got the Kalbi or the pork belly because they were out of it and I'm wondering how because it's day one for them and we were literally one of the first customers. The Gyoza is good and the bulgogi is good. The sushi is decent but there was a weird taste to the crunch rolls. It got busier and what became frustrating is that my table was not getting the service we wanted. What started off as Steven as our server became every server taking our orders getting super confused and then the servers are confused because there's like 4 servers trying to help us and couldn't get our food on time. It was a really long wait to get food. We thought to ourselves not a very good first impression but we will come back when they fixed the kinks.  Day 2: we went yesterday Thursday a day before the final day for 50% off. Just me and my girlfriend this time and we had a table fit for two and we had a guy as our server I don't recall his name but I noticed had like 3 tables two of those tables was me and my girlfriend and another couple sitting next to us. The other table was like a party of 3. Our server was a bit better than last time because he initially took care of us but as the time progressed he forgot about us a lot and I watched him help the other tables back and forth and look at me but would forget to come back and so many times would forget our order and have to remind him three times.   The positive that made me and my girlfriend experience there better was this girl who was working the tables at the other side of the restaurant she was in charge of the tables party of 10, 7, and like 8. She was hustling. Her name is Almira and she walked all the way over to us and asked if we were taken care of and we let her know that we thought but we've been waiting. She decided to help us out even though she had those tables with a huge party when she took our order she got our food in time, she refilled our waters on time which by the way I've been waiting to get refilled if it wasn't for Almira. We got more food and she made sure it got to us. We finally tried the Kalbi and pork belly and it's actually very good. She was a very hard worker and regardless how busy, her customer service stayed on point. We got our desserts on time. The original guy came back and asked if we're okay we told him yes because Almira has been helping us and we really want our check so we can leave now. He said ok be right back and he never came back and we waited 15 more minutes and Almira comes back and asks what we are still doing here because she thought after desserts we would have paid and leave and we told her the situation and she got us our check in not even a minute. So explain that please Gorilla.   Me and my girlfriend were so pleased with how amazing Almiras customer service was and he ability to work under pressure and still be on top of her game. She deserves to be a lead and show everyone else how it's done. The full five stars is respectively for Almira. Thanks from me and my girlfriend for turning our frown upside down.  TIP: ask for Almira next time to serve you, try the Hawaiian Kalbi and pork belly and the sexy salmon nigiri.",

    "text": "I am a big garlic tuna lover so that is usually the first thing I taste when coming into a sushi place as a first timer. I actually like it but beware that they are very generous when it comes to their garlic sauce, which could be a good thing for some and bad for others. I love garlic sauce so it did not phase me at all. Another sushi roll that stood out to me was their bulgogi roll - very good. I have tasted the basic nigiris as well and it tasted pretty fresh. It was only my friend and I in the restaurant so our orders came in quick and our server refilled our waters a lot, and checked up on us consistently. However, we did go into the AYCE mindset where everything is all you can eat including desserts (limiting mochi ice-cream like the other restaurants) and this place only lets you chose ONE dessert item per person. So if you want two scoops of green tea ice-cream, you can't. In our case we wanted to try their fried ice-cream and mochi ice-cream but we could only chose one, other sushi places offer the flexibility to have as much ice-cream scoops and misc. dessert items more than once. That was the only issue for me, I paid $20+ for AYCE when I can't even have the entire package then I might as well go to another restaurant with the same price, and better menu flexibility.",

Ambiance is good (though location could be better). Now the food.. mostly fresh but BLAND. Oddly-shaped nigiris have way too little rice. I had salmon and yellowtail nigiris = bland. I liked the charred eel nigiri but it was overcooked = dry. Gorilla special handroll was bland. Their uni nigiri was the worst I've had by far. Not fresh and very fishy.... and BLAND! I would say this place is more of a korean-japanese fusion. Their Korean dishes are way tastier than their Japanese food offerings. The sushi chefs were all Koreans (figured). Don't be fooled by the pictures posted in Yelp. Food will come to you in a lot smaller fashion.  Our experience wasn't really bad. Just very very average. Will I go back?Probably not.   Dinner AYCE of $25.95 is standard but you're better off with Sakana (best AYCE sushi by far in my book) or Yama Sushi (the only place with $23.95 AYCE dinner price).",

Took what seemed a lifetime just  to order. Literally flagging down anyone who would look our way. Finally decided to get it togo. Cash in book ready to pay for another 6 minutes. Decided to walk to the register to pay. No smiles nor thank yous. Whatevs. Don't mind long waits but I cannot stand for businesses with no passion. The only two things I ordered (two rolls) were missing from my togo. Not enough energy to go back for a refund. And cannot imagine ever going back to figure it out.

Not the best place we've been to for AYCE but probably a close 2nd. They also have 4 TVs each on opposite sites of the restaurant playing different channels. Two of them were playing Korean music videos, which are always entertaining to watch and add to the atmosphere. We will be back!",

If you it's love rolls I think this place has one of the best varieties as far as rolls and offers more options than most spots. I love super white tuna it's basically my fave fish and that's only reason I'm giving this a 4 star. Service was fantastic and food was great the space was great. Also I'm not a big salmon lover but that sexy salmon in bomb. I'll be back for sure to eat here again",

    "text": "A detour on lunch break choices lead me and a co-worker to this great find. Located in a tight strip mall plaza, I was pleasantly surprised how modern and clean it was inside. We were greeted right away and was seated even though we were planning on getting our food to go.   The dining area was open and spacious. The ceiling had an interesting lighting which brightened up the room quite well. There were 3 chefs at the bar area, which I thought about sitting over there as it was welcoming. Also because it was not the super high table tops I have encountered before at other restaurants. The waitress, Claire, was very friendly and took our orders. Since I couldn't decide, Claire asked me what roll I liked best and I said super white is usually my go to and she recommended the I Love My A** Roll. The menu said it was spicy, but I went for it. Also ordered the Japanese Lasagna, honey toast, spicy ramen, Washington Roll, and Alaska Roll.  Ice cold water was brought out as we waited for our food. The manager, Amy, went above and beyond my expectation. She checked on us as we waited and offered some fried gyoza because she knew we were on lunch and must be hungry! How thoughtful! There is also an AYCE lunch special available, so I will be sure to keep that in mind.  All the food was neatly packaged and I wished I had more time to dine inside, since service was solid. The honey toast was delicious. The Japanese Lasagna was a cream cheese and crab meat delight. The Love Roll was spicy, but I kept eating it anyways. The Washing and Alsaka Roll was mostly salmon based and tasted fresh. Since I didn't have the ramen myself, my coworker said was good, spicy, and had lots of mushrooms in it. I will have to give the ramen try next time. The honey toast was warm had a good honey coating that blended well with the vanilla ice cream. Not a huge portion, but it was enough to satisfy the sweet tooth after a big lunch.  All in all, I am so glad I gave this place a try. The sushi was good, the place is clean and the honey toast was as sweet as their service. Will be coming back soon to try the rest of the menu out.",

She took care of us from start to finish, as soon as we walked through the door. She was very friendly and did her job very well. I'd be back for sure. Oh I was suppose to review the Gorilla Sushi. Ok fine.   Let's start again. I like Gorilla Sushi. The one thing really going for them is the quality of their seafood. Its excellent. The nigiris have the perfect fish to rice ratio, huge nice cuts of fish and less rice. The garlic tuna, salmon, and hamachi were my favs and would recommend. I believe they offer only an order of sashimi for their AYCE and its only for dinner. I liked the salmon skin salad, screaming orgasm, and white orgasm were all tasty just don't wear a white shirt. They also have a lots of appetizers not just sushi like kalbi, bulgogi, soups, spicy fried chicken. For desserts they're only one order person but they have a good selection like the green tea cheese cake, mochi ice, snowflake which is shaved ice with condensed milk and some flavors chocolate and red bean, affogato, and a few more. The rolls were good couldn't remember them as I ate a lot of different ones. You can order half rolls for a lot of them.  They did forget to make a few items that may or may not have been ordered but no biggy everyone has that problem keeping up with my appetite. Just placed another order then all good. I'd definitely be back though.",

I kept waiting and hoping for the OMG moment, but it never came.   My very handsome date and I tried a wide variety of nigiri, sashimi, apps, and rolls.  My favorite was the Caterpillar Roll. The Eel sauce was not too too sweet or overwhelming.  He liked the uni (Sea Urchin) nigiri sushi - which is fine. He can have mine.  We both agreed that the rice was good.  Minor complaint; the music was a bit boisterous and loud for us - but we're a couple of 50-year-old guys who like to converse and gaze adoringly into each other's eyes while we dine. This was a bit more of a college party atmosphere than we tend to enjoy. But that's just us.  With so many great AYCE sushi places in town, Gorilla will either have to get more creative or up the overall food quality for this to be a regular stop for us.",

I must say, I love their garlic salmon & garlic tuna nigiri. Actually, just all their nigiris were really good and great portion of fish! We also tried their seared salmon (least favorite), sweet ebi, and white tuna.   I think we overdone it with their appetizers. We tried their oyster, shrimp tempura, fried chicken, shrimp and asparagus skewer and baked green mussel, which by the way I really enjoyed and had way less cheese and cream than most AYCE places.   And the reason why I say we over done it with the rolls is because we could barely finish the actual rolls we ordered. Not really a fan of rolls to begin with, but we decided to try three of them, Boom Boom, Gorilla lasagna and Japanese pizza. The Japanese pizza and gorilla lasagna were pretty much the same flavor, so it was hard to eat both of them.  And to top it off, we ordered Mochi ice cream and Japanese cheesecake for dessert.  Overall, it was probably a 4.5, rounded up of course. The quality of the food was great and the service was also very quick!",

    "text": "I give gorilla sushi two star for their excellent customer service.  As far as their nigiri rolls and appetizer, they really under deliver. It is an All You Can Eat sushi restaurant but there's no quality in the food they serve whatsoever. I ordered tempura shrimp, soft shell crab and fried rice to start as appetizer. The fried rice was not edible because it was WAY WAY TOO SALTY. I didn't think I ordered a block of salt. Soft shell crab was fried and too oily for my taste.   Take this as a cautionary tale. Read their menu thoroughly including the 7 rules they listed on the menu. My mistake was to not catch this before coming in as first visitor. I was ready to walk out of the restaurant when the waitress told me that I will be charged a la carte if I didn't finish my rice (part of nigiri). They serve nigiri with decent size rice underneath but the rice was mushy and again way too salty.  There's also extra charge for left overs. If I didn't speak up about how awful my dining experience has been here with my waiter might have walked out with a bill bigger than the size of purse.   Beware! I won't consider their fish 'fresh'. I definitely won't be going back.",

Very disappointed and I spent a lot of money. Couldn't eat all of my fried rice because all I could taste and smell was an overpowering fishy smell.",

Can't blame the itame because they didn't get the proper training, this is the owner's responsibility. Becoming a good itamae takes years of training and apprenticeship with a master itamae.  We've ordered the asparagus beef the forst order came and it was grilled, not bad. The second order came and it was deep fride, it was very oily.   The service was good at the beginning, after 45 minutes had a hard time getting our server to come by and take more orders.  This resto have potentials, hope the flaws will get corrected.",

They have a VARIETY of rolls to choose from, including some with interestingly funny names! Three of us got the lunch special ($20.95) whereas my sister chose dinner (25.95). We realized there were some options only for dinner and that's why she chose that one. What's really awesome about this place is that they have korean food and ramen on their menu as well. All their sushi rolls were delicious and they really don't skimp out on the fish/meats. The rice to fish ratio was pretty good, not too much rice like some places. The only downfall I have is that the special options that comes with the dinner price can only be ordered once and you can not waste any food (including rice!!) All in all, really good spot if you're looking to indulge in a huge amount of sushi! I will definitely go back!",

The staff is great, and the chefs will always delight your taste buds with their creations.   Have you ever been to a place so often that it becomes a regular thing, and you start overlooking it?  It had been a few weeks since I had gone back to Gorilla, and I had tried a few other places.  Suddenly I found myself drawn to come back.  As the song goes, it feels like the first time...  Some places wow with a huge assortment of rolls which have nothing different except for order of ingredients, or sauces.  Not Gorilla.  Gorilla has many different rolls that are not just swapping sauces, but creatively topped, and well thought out.  Their Nigiri is always one of my favorite options, I love their Cajun Albacore.   There are many options, but none have the great food, staff, and atmosphere of Gorilla.  Especially late at night, this is definitely a great hang out spot.

Also the slices of fish was fairly small on the sushi orders, especially compared to other of the highly rated AYCE places in the proximity. Have to keep going here... the salmon roe was also not fresh... not plump and super salty. I used to come here more often but found a far better place for ayce in the neighborhood. I will not be back.",

The fish was super fresh and everything was delicious. All the waiters work as a team to continuously bring you plates and clean up. They would quietly come pick up plates and trash so you didn't even see them. They would also constantly refill our drinks. They would explain which plate of sushi it was so we knew. The waiter JB would remember which one of us ordered exactly which roll. He had us laughing the entire time! He was so funny! I have never had a better experience anywhere else and never will! I am now a forever customer!",

First of all, it was great to get off the Vegas Strip and eat someplace not so glorified, over priced and yuck. Neighborhood wasn't the greatest but parking was close. Service was exceptional from \"Brian\". He was very welcoming and knew his job well. He recommended and was available for questions. Tempura was out fast and was nice. We have an allergy to sesame seeds and they were more than happy to accommodate. The rolls were awesome! I had a McCarran Airport and the wife had a Megabucks. They were so good, we went back for a Hello Monkey to finish us off. This was a weird combo but we were down to try it! (Deep fried banana with soft shell crab)  it was surprisingly amazing and paired together well! Definitely will be back here every time we visit Vegas. They've only been open a year but this place will have a hard time keeping empty seats before too long. Do it! You'll be satisfied!",

It's just delicious in every way. And we tried basically everything but the rolls. The salmon collar was slightly over cooked but everything else was just delicious and had us in awe.   Totally didn't expect to find such a hidden gem in that area but pleaseee give them a shot. They're worth it!",

My driver sat around for an HOUR after the pickup time while I called the manager to have him tell me that they don't hand over deliveries to anyone but their driver and it would be ready in 10 minutes but they didn't have a driver (they spoke to my delivery guy who was IN THE FRONT FOR AN HOUR ALREADY READY TO GO)   Called grubhub and they called them to find out what was going on. 10 minutes it will be ready.   2 hours into this wonderful venture I call Grubhub after confirming their driver was still there. Grubhub calls them and cancels the order because they don't have any drivers. EVEN THOUGH GRUBHUB HAS BEEN SITTING THERE FOR 1.5 hours waiting for a 5 ITEM ORDER.   WELP they must have gotten a transcript because after they cancelled my order they called Grubhub back to find out if I wanted my order... they could get it to me ASAP   I told them to let the manager know he could go ---- himself.   Probably good food. Horrible management with a complete lack of common sense.",

Now....on to the food: My daughter and I ordered the all you can eat (AYCE) option, we had 4 different rolls and each one was better than the next. The flavor was as beautiful as the presentation. We have never been to an AYCE sushi, and your only limitation is time...you have 90 mins; however, you can order any and all of the rolls in the menu.  No matter where you are staying it is worth the drive!",

The place is my all time favourite, better than anywhere in CA. The nigiri menu is so big and has all of my favourites, everything is so fresh, and the rolls are amazing! I usually only eat sashimi and nigiri but their rolls have really turned me on to more than my usual.   I recommend the orange crush roll for sure! The mackerel nigiri, garlic tuna nigiri , and yellowtail Yuzu nigiri are to die for! The oysters and uni are so fresh, I don't wanna swallow, I have to savour every bit of it.   The AYCE is an amazing deal and they give you plenty of time to enjoy your food. The atmosphere is relaxed and he staff have always been so kind to me, my husband, and my son, Even though I'm the only one that orders any food(I'm the only one who eats sushi). I will come here again and again, also, get the Melona bar for dessert, best way to end the meal!",

I had pretty high hopes coming into this place because of the high reviews, but I was extremely disappointed. I understand that all you can eat sushi restaurants usually don't have the best quality fish, but the food here wasn't even edible.  The rice was mushy, the fish tasted old, the miso soup was too salty, there were ice chunks in the oysters, etc. Maybe I just came on a bad night, but I don't plan on returning to see if it improves.",

The atmosphere is amazing they play super hip music, the restaurant is very clean as well. This place is by far the BEST sushi place in Vegas. And I mean its better then Nobu and Kabuto. The reason why I'm saying this is because the chef here Adrian and Jason are masters in creating some amazing dishes. They are truly artists.  The service here is Outstanding all the servers are amazing at what they do especially Carlos and JB these two are absolutely phenomenal make sure to ask for them it will make your whole experience here top-notch. All and all the owner of this place sure knows how do pick and train he's employees. My hats off to the owner. Best restaurant in Vegas. Thanks, team Gorilla sushi. See you guys next Sunday",

We ended up at Gorilla Sushi, which is inconspicuously placed in a strip mall (didn't quite avoid the strip part of Vegas) with other places to eat.   The best thing about Gorilla Sushi is the option of ordering a HALF roll.  All the places I've ever eaten have required me to order a WHOLE roll, forcing me to limit my choices and to finish whole rolls.  I ordered the Fuego, the Mega Bucks (Vegas!), and the Tiger Rolls. All delicious! And the staff was everywhere!  The selections are broad and enticing. Some rolls I've never seen on a sushi menu before. In addition, there are many appetizer options, including my favorite seaweed salad.  AYCE Lunch ends at 3:00 ($21) AYCE Dinner ends at close ($26)",

Now on to the food! The Sushi selection is definitely up-to-par! We chose the riceless roles, so yes that's an option! We're going low carb! Lol! If you're looking for an appetizer, try the ramen noodles. Ramen is something I grew up eating. This is one of the best Ramen Noodle bowls I've had, although I haven't eaten ramen in years. And... Not low carb! Lol! The broth was delicious! Kind of tasted like French Onion Soup! Love it! The Sushi rolls were excellent! And believe me two rolls were more than enough! Glad we didn't pick the the all you eat option on the menu! Oh yeah, All You Can eat is $20. Not too bad!   Anyway, if you're near, give this place a try. It's not a fancy place, but the people are cool and food is pretty good! Plenty of TVs mounted on the walls if you want to watch the game while you dine!",

    "text": "We came here mid-afternoon for AYCE and were not disappointed!  We chose Gorilla over other AYCE sushi buffets in the area because Gorilla doesn't have many limitations at all with regards to what you can order. With any 'limit 1' dish being per person rather than per table and a menu longer than your arm, you will not be disappointed to eat here and are sure to leave full and satisfied!  Ariel was our server and he was awesome. Super friendly, attentive and was great with menu recommendations. He always made sure we had food and drink at the table and from walking in the door to leaving through it again at the end, we were made to feel extremely welcome.  We had a number of different dishes and I can't comment on the shrimp or chicken ones as I don't eat those, but a few highlights for me were the baked lobster roll and the Japanese lasagne. OMG, these two were awesome! Great amount of lobster on the lobster roll, really tasty sauces to accompany and the crunch on top was a great texture change from the soft baked roll.  And the Japanese lasagne?! OHHHH the lasagne!! SO goooooood! Honestly, I'd never tried it before and I never would have if it wasn't for a friend I was dining with telling me to try it. Best thing he's ever done for me. I ordered a second. Just.. if you haven't tried it before, try it. Thank me later!  Services were great, beers were great and prices are competitive, although having said that, only disappointment was their dinner pricing starts at 3pm, which is a bit cheeky in my eyes. I think a 4pm dinner start is a little more reasonable, but having said that, it's still good value for money. Just make sure you come with an appetite!  If I'm ever wanting AYCE sushi again, I'd cross town for this and recommend it to anyone!",

My friend ordered AYCE and I ordered their miso ramen. My friend lost his appetite after spotting a roach inside the restaurant (on the wall behind the sushi bar) and the ramen broth was bland and not memorable. The noodles also resembled instant noodles.  The server had an extremely difficult time understanding us and it took about 3-4 conversations with 2 different servers to eventually express our dissatisfaction.   Overall not a positive experience and certainly do not plan on returning.",

We actually brought our family from Australia during the holidays but I was so busy, I didn't get a chance to update my review then. Their Menu selection has become longer, more choices and the place is very lively, clean, welcoming and majority of the staff are very friendly with great smiles for everyone.  Carlos, one of the best hosts here is our favorite. He has always helped us in each of our visits and he makes us feel like family. He is amazing. Look for him when you guys visit.  There is no wrong or right in any of their dishes, try them all, I believe they won't disappoint.  Two thumbs up!!!",

The Food was just food enough to fill you but not anything I would try again. Let me be honest I had no idea how big \"All You Can Eat Sushi\" is in Vegas.  I mean the closer I look on Yelp I notice it and the sad thing is everything lacked quality. I'm expected so much from Vegas sushi.   We order shrimp fried rice, a baked scallop roll and a crunch roll.   From the pictures you can see how small the shrimp were and that they were not deveined....ugh gross. The baked scallop were bay scallops just thrown on top of the sushi. The crab was mixed with some creamy sauce that had way too much mozzarella. If your craving sushi in Vegas DO NOT COME HERE",

Service was fairly quick and the servers were very friendly. There was specifically one who was quite attentive and knew how to keep a conversation going.  Now onto the rolls!   Who's Your Daddy- It has no rice, deep fried and there were 4 rolls in total. The eel and yum yum sauce were great. My most favorite out of everything we ordered.   Vampire Roll- This one has a nice kick to it. It literally has spicy crab inside and spicy tuna on top. The spicy mayo was a nice touch as well.  Jungle Book Roll- The deep fried carrots on top made each bite kind of sweet. I kept tasting banana for some reason as well. It was interesting.  Popcorn Lobster Roll- It has 4 California rolls with lobster tempura on top. It was like 4 deep fried balls of lobster and I had to eat it separate from the roll itself. This one was okay.  Baked Lobster Roll- The baked lobster on top was so good. I think this one was a California roll as well. My sister really liked this one.  Gorilla Bite Roll- When I took a bite out of this one, I definitely tasted the cucumber. It was pretty cold and refreshing. It threw me off but the baked eel and eel sauce on top was nice.  Overall, my sister and I had a pleasant experience. Since it's so close to UNLV, I'll probably pop by soon.",

It was amazing!  $20 for AYCE lunch and it was beautiful.  Tried sashimi, nigiri, and some specialty rolls. They let us try half rolls, which I love because you can try more things.  That screaming orgasm though!  So dang good.  Topped off the amazing meal with strawberry mochi.  The staff were super nice and attentive.  I will definitely be coming to Gorilla Sushi the next time I'm in town.  It's our new favorite!",

There were only two sushi chefs working and one of them was apparently a new hire who was struggling to keep up with the orders. I felt right away that service would be slow and so I asked the waitress and she agreed. It's a shame because the menu had a lot of interesting items I wanted to try but not at the expense of waiting half a day for my food to come out. I left and drove to another AYCE sushi spot with faster service.",

Normally one would think that's not a good sign.... but not here! I was happy that it was empty, my wife and I got superior service and even got to have a small chat with Alex the owner who told us they had only been here for 3 months! Their head chef Eddie is a delight and really knows what he's doing behind the counter, the sashimi was so fresh and seasoned so perfectly, the rolls we ordered were so damn good and had so much flavor. We've been to a lot of AYCE spots in California as well as Nevada and this place has by far been our favorite. The seating is great, I'm a big guy so very happy I was able to move the table and the booths to my liking. The beer was buy one get one free!! I love my Sapporo! Their mussels are also just a great as the rest of their food. If you're in the area and want amazing sushi off the strip i highly recommend Gorilla sushi!! Thanks to Alex the Owner, Eddie the chef, and Austin our  server for bringing forth optimum service and food!!! For the price you really can't beat it!!!!",

    "text": "I usually like eating at gorilla sushi when I'm around the area, so I decided to eat here during lunchtime with friends and family. So we walk in and we were immediately seated, asked what we wanted to drink. The server then disappeared into the kitchen and took her time to bring out drinks. It also took awhile for us to be able to order, (though there were only 2 people out of 4 at our table, so I don't completely blame the delay in being able to put in an order). After some time, we were able to order. Sweet.  The rest of my party comes, and everything is pretty okay, we ordered some more. Time passes and eventually the customer service deteriorates. We ordered our last round of food and a dessert for one person.  While waiting for the food, a check hits the table. Uhhh sorry we didn't say we were done yet? We just ordered more food!! It's as if we were being rushed out. We were a little bit over the \"time limit,\" but it was not busy at all, there were only 3 other tables so I doubt that it was being reinforced. If the server was concerning us with the time limit, she could've told us that we were overstaying our welcome. Anyways, the food came and we ordered dessert for the rest of the party. Mind you, we were still not done eating so we didn't pay attention to putting the payment in the check yet. (Not like it's our fault). All of a sudden the check is being taken away with an insincere \"thank you.\" The server thought that we were ready to pay, but my mom told them that there isn't anything in the check. Lol. You think this is the worst of it all? No it gets worse. My mom decides to tip in cash, and sets it to the side. She was actually planning to put it in the check so she can personally hand it to the server. A couple seconds later, that tip was snatched right off of the table. Wtf? Rude?? I'm a server at another restaurant,,,and its common knowledge that it's courteous to not touch the tip (let alone snatch it off the table lol) or the signed check until the customer has left. Food was alright today, but only it was because they stood on the bar area for long periods of time (8-10 minutes) because of incompetence. Customer service was just a miss today. It's usually great, especially with server Jay. I was hoping that he was working today but unfortunately he wasn't. Too bad. This business is lucky for getting a 3 star from me despite the \"service\" from lunchtime today.  PS, it was \"Connie\"",

I am the type of person that doesn't like to complain and usually just brush stuff off. But I did feel the need to say something since we did tell him from the start we'd like separate checks & he seemed perfectly fine with it. When I did inform him, he became irritated, gave me a horrible attitude and basically accused me & said it was my fault. They did reverse the charge & apologized in the end. I gave it 2-stars because the food was pretty good & I did enjoy the place before the server had an attitude.",

I didn't experience the subpar service the other reviewers have mentioned, so I'm assuming all of the grand opening kinks have been ironed out by now. They have a very extensive menu that has something for everyone - even vegetarians and non-fish eaters. I went in a group of four (all of us seasoned sushi vets) and everyone had a superb meal from beginning to end. Our server (female, don't remember her name) was very attentive throughout the meal, refilling our drinks without us having to ask, clearing empty plates immediately, and taking additional orders. The manager (Chung, I think his name was?) was also very attentive and friendly, taking time to stop by our (and other's) table to check-in and see how our meal/service was going. He seemed to be popular with another table, as well, as I saw them buy him some sake to drink with them. Wish people at my job would liquor me up lol  Even though this place is farther than some of the aforementioned places I used to frequent, this will definitely be my new go-to AYCE sushi spot! Don't be discouraged by the negative reviews regarding service (which seem to have been resolved); do yourself a favor and go try this place out!",

GOOD: LOTS of varieties and everything was delicious. Friendly, solid service $1 sake and beer Mon-Thurs.  SERIOUSLY, $1!!! $.01 sake on Tuesdays. That's NOT a typo. Ample parking AYCE = $26-ish?  I didnt pay attention to the exact amount. CLEAN restaurant AYCE includes EVERYTHING that was on the menu... apps, salad, speciality rolls, nigiri (even uni!), sashimi, dessert.  BAD:  A little hard to find.  It's in a strip mall w/a 7-11. Some of sushi roll names are super stupid and embarrassing to order in front of my parents (eg. 'Eat Your Ass Roll').  I will definitely be coming here again and again.",

Moments later, the chef whipped up some of my favorites. Sexy Girl, Orange roll, Just for the Halibut (yeah... they have halibut there!) and you know how you don't think you can do a whole roll, you can get a half roll. Great fresh food, clean restaurant, great service. Go there!",

    "text": "Gorilla Sushi is still very new, so I understand that service may not be the best, but... woo. I came with two of my friends on the last day of their half off special and around 6pm, which unfortunately seemed to be the peak dinner rush, as we walked inside to a completely full line. One of the servers kept returning to the front to take names down for a waiting list, and it reached a point where some people were warned of a two hour wait and people waited outside to be called in. It took my friends and I roughly an hour to be seated, but even then, people who came after us were seated first and it seemed they had lost our name on the list (rip). When we mentioned it the server, he immediately seated us at an open table, where we sat for another 10 or 15 minutes before flagging down a different server for a few waters. She was very kind and immediately took our order, and my friends and I decided to order quite a lot because we expected them to be done slowly due to the high volume of people in the restaurant.   We never had one specific server attending to us - we ending up interacting with each one, but usually to ask about the status of our other orders or to request more food, because our first server never came back until the end of our meal. They didn't seem to have assigned tables to specific servers, which may have furthered the confusion when trying to deliver orders. All of the servers were very nice and tried to make sure we were getting our orders, and one was sweating terribly from continuously running around, so I never felt irritated by the service even though it wasn't great. In the end, a decent chunk of our orders never arrived, we received a few wrong orders for different tables, and we never got any water refills (we never asked for any, but I assumed it would be done automatically?). They had run out of a few items by the time we were able to order - sea urchin, most of the mochi ice creams, and fried ice cream - but it wasn't a big deal to us. Ultimately, we spent 4 hours trying to get all of our orders, and our friend who mainly came for appetizers (not much of a sushi fan) left still a bit hungry because those came out the slowest. They also apparently closed early, as they were turning away customers while my table and 3/4ths of the restaurant was still eating around 9.  Side notes on a few memorable dishes: - Takoyaki costs $4.50, comes with only TWO balls, and an incredibly small piece of octopus inside. Highway robbery if you're ordering that for a la carte.  - The deep fried rolls have a very thin layer of batter on the outside, so if you love ordering it for the crunch that gives, you may be disappointed.  - Bulgogi was super tender! I think this might be a Korean owned place, because there was \"spicy rice cake\" available, which I was fairly certain meant ddeokbokki. I haven't seen that at other sushi places before, but I also don't go out for sushi that often.   Objectively, the conflicting service was two stars because of the multiple mix-ups and forgetting portions of each of our four orders. Interior decor and the fact that they're still new gets them another, because I didn't leave unhappy - they definitely need to improve their system though. The only items I loved were a few appetizers - namely the gyoza, shumai, and bulgogi - while everything else didn't quite stand out to me. Personally, I wouldn't come again just because there wasn't much I was crazy for from what I tried.",

We just ate at Kabuto last night which was 10x the price but I wouldn't say 10x the quality of fish. Check this place out and do the all you can eat.",

It was late at night around 11pm so there weren't many tables around us.   Food was bland. A fusion of sushi and korean food yet lack taste from both. Watered down miso soup, watery corn cheese, hands down the worst dynamite we've ever tasted - a mixture of pieces of imitation crabs, scallops, and spicy mayo, and also dry sashimi.   Never ever going back there.",

The shopping complex is not the most enticing at night and really has no appeal during the day. We live quite a distance from this place but this has been our favorite spot recently.   What's appealing is they have different dishes compared to most places. It might be the Korean-Japanese fusion which they found a nice balance on most of their specialties.  Service has always been reliable as well.  We love this place that Im about to walk in this place right now!",

Sushi sounded good, so I checked out the rating on Yelp.  Decided that's where we were eating and it did NOT disappoint! Boyfriend and I got the all you can eat for $25 and went through 8-1/2 rolls. (Yes, theyll do half rolls, so you can have more variety). We tried 10 different rolls and loved them all. My favorites were Tastes Like My Ex Girlfriend and Gorilla (something?) It had mango and banana in it and it was awesome.  The service was fantastic. I will definitely make a point to visit this place everytime I visit Vegas.  We also told our server at Stack, the next night, and he planned to go that night when he got off work haha!",

    "text": "Came here last night with some friends to take advantage of their grand opening special, which was 50% off everything, including their AYCE. AYCE dinner is around $25 per person regular price so during their special, it ends up to be $12.50 per person. That is a wonderful price. However, I can't say that everything else was wonderful.   We got to the establishment at around 7 pm and we started to order our food at around 715 pm. We ordered some appetizers and a lot of sushi. All of our appetizers came before any of our sushi came. We waited and waited ... and waited ... and waited. The servers kept apologizing but it's really not their fault. The sushi chefs were backed up. They only had three sushi chefs that were fulfilling the whole restaurants orders. Clearly, they couldn't keep up. So we decided to put in another order because if it's going to take this long to get our first order, we might as well. So when/if our first order came, our second order should be here after we finish right?   We decided to order more appetizers since the kitchen isn't backed up at all. We would order their galbi, soups, mussels, etc. Turns out they're out of the salmon collar or perhaps they didn't even have it to begin with. Also turns out they were out of sweet shrimp and uni, which the first server failed to inform us about.   You know there's something wrong when your second set of sushi orders came out but your first set of sushi orders is still missing. It turns out our first sushi orders were placed somewhere and the chefs never got to it. So our second orders got to the chef first while our first order was sitting in oblivion. We had to bring up the issue about 2-3 times to the servers and to the manager. We eventually decided to put in a third order cause our first order was taking so long. Anddddd they came to let us know that they ran out of salmon and unagi. WHAT. Half of our first order had at least 20 orders of salmon. Now if they'd fulfill that first order....  For the whole night, we had about 4-5 orders and none of them were 100% completed. On top of that, our dinner took 3.5 hours, which is a ridiculous amount of time. One of our friends wasn't full but he didn't want to order anything more because we'd have to wait another half an hour. We actually joked that we'd be here waiting until the next morning.    The restaurant was never 100% full the whole night we were there so I'm not sure why everything took forever. Not only that but they ran out of or didn't have: uni, sweet shrimp, salmon collar, unagi, salmon, kalbi, and tempura ice cream. I have never been to a sushi restaurant where they ran out of FISH. Yes, it's their first week. Yes, they are still new. But uhm, if you're going to offer 50% off then you should be adequately prepared.   Honestly, even with the great price, I don't think it was worth 3.5 hours of my time. I'm not sure if I'd return to the establishment for lunch or dinner.",

    "text": "I have SO much to review and, unfortunately, it's not very pleasant. Needless to say, we all know that this place had its grand opening only a couple days ago and are offering half off AYCE sushi. I thought I'd wait until the hype had died down, but was given a chance to come tonight. A couple friends and I came here tonight (Tuesday night) a little before 7pm, apparently right after a party of 25 came in.  Entrance : you enter through unmarked regular doors and come upon a wall straight in front of you. There, you wait for someone to seat you when they see you(Fortunately for us, my friend was seated and we didn't have to wait there, but we saw many people standing awkwardly for a while until someone approached them).   Decor: white walls over, chic wood looking benches/seats, sushi bar to the left, and a colored and lit DJ/Bar looking area to the back. Very clean   Service: Servers are super nice. Devi was amazing, and always checked up on us, as well as tried to get our orders going along. However the service time was Ridiculously long. We waited an hour after we ordered, to get our food from the bar. (we were able to snack on \"appetizers\" that were able to be made in the back, such as edamame). They spent all of their time waiting on the group of 25, that we could see that our table as well as 5 others around us weren't being served anything. The 3 sushi chefs (found out that one had called out) were filling orders only for that table, and no other tables were served. When they were finally serving good to other tables, lots of rolls were being run to the wrong tables. However, you could tell everyone on staff plus the man who we believe may have been the owner or MOD at the time was frantically trying to figure it out. Effort was great, execution was not. Definitely needed to fix their system.   Food: after waiting an hour (1 hr and 4 min actually) for our first roll from the actual bar, it was just subpar. You could tell at this point that they just needed to get orders out. It was made a bit sloppier, with a tad too much sauce on a couple of the rolls, but the quality of some of the fish was actually pretty good. (Fatty, large pieces of salmon nigiri was great). Unfortunately we didn't get to try all the rolls we ordered because they missed about 3 rolls. (1 order would be missing out of 4 that we would ask for per ticket).  **if you do go in the future, order the dessert type roll. (gorilla roll?) It has mango, banana, and strawberry and was pretty good. Even decided to order vanilla ice cream with it.   Honestly, I believe this has largely to do with them being open for such a short amount of time and most likely not being prepared for large crowds/large parties. We left 2.5 hours later at 9:30, not full and not very satisfied. We even felt bad for the table that came in not too long after us that had barely gotten any food. If it wasn't for how wonderful and sympathetic our server was as well as the the decor, this place would have 1 star.   My suggestion is to stay away from this place until at least a couple weeks after the grand opening and come during slower hours. :) the half off was not worth it.",

Favorites were the Holy Cow, kiss of fire and something wrong. Pleasantly surprised on the quality of fish and the amount you get as the rolls are larger than a lot of restaurants we have gone too.   We are used to the Japanese style appetizers and the variety of Korean type food is great.   Don't forget to check in and get a free beverage on them.  We are definitely adding this to our go to restaurants:)",

It's got all my favorite rolls (including Japanese lasagna) and plenty to choose from.   Austin our server was very nice. He let us know when the kitchen was backed up and politely suggested an appetizer while we waited (great up-sell dude).   This is my second time, and I'll definitely come back.",

We decided to go for it even though it was a sketchy lot with a bunch of crack heads. The manager and employees were very nice! We got the all you can eat. It was about $25 which is a good price for as much as we ate. My brother and dad like more plain rolls while my mom and I like more extravagant rolls. We all enjoyed the 007 roll and got like 4 of them. We also enjoyed the shrimp fried rice and the chicken teriyaki is to die for. The fried gyoza was good and so were the egg rolls. The Lobster and Mexican roll were delicious as well. The only thing I didn't enjoy was the Korean BBQ roll. We even got dessert with the meal! If we ever are in Vegas i definitely plan to go back.",

A good 12-15 minutes passed and people after us were being served, then finally someone asked if we had been helped...  First off the food here is good, they just need to get their shit together. I ordered Hamachi Kama, which is not on the menu but was stoked that they offered it because I LOVE HAMACHI KAMA. I ordered that shit first. After about 30 minutes, and after seeing 3 hamachi kamas go this family, I asked to check on it. Only to find out that the family got my order and they ran out. Thanks gorilla sushi for letting me down and thank you to the family for just taking my order and not refusing.   We also ordered Udon in which our server insisted TWO TIMES, it took long because the kitchen was backed up. It's not busy at all, how long does it take make udon? Apparently 30 minutes. Come to find out they lost the order and it was ready after 3 minutes after ordering it a 3rd time...  We left not satisfied, and still missing a few dishes. Big up to the server for crediting us just one AYCE because of their fuck ups...   HEREs the bottom line. Your food is good, you really need to re-evaluate your service. Your servers do not know which table is which, as I heard them counting. You lost points with me when my hamachi Kama, which I love so dearly was given to someone else, and you take long for service... A simple sorry will not do, our server apologized for their fuck ups like a dozen times...   Wouldnt mind trying here again but until then, I will not returning until they get their shit together... This is what I get for a restaurant that has a grand opening with a gimmick of half off...",

Sashimi and hand rolls and essentially everything on their menu is up for grabs. That includes all the apps too! Gyoza, pork belly, tataki, seaweed salads, soups...  All for $20!!!

    "text": "Bomb sushi in Las Vegas. Ordered multiple rolls, udon, and was able to get free sake as part of the yelp promotion. The meal was actually filling, reasonably priced for sushi, and delicious. Can't recall everything I ordered, but the Spider Roll was flavorful and had great texture/freshness. Rainbow roll and Hollywood Roll were both top notch. The udon was not the most flavorful, but the portion size was good and we purposefully wanted something that was more light tasting. Didn't have any complaints about the service or atmosphere, and would go again in a heartbeat if I lived in the city! I liked that there was a ton of variety in the menu. Would love to try more things here.",

Don't get me wrong, I understand if places are not always packed but for literally an hour, we were the only ones inside.   The customer service was awesome! Servers and sushi chefs were very accommodating and friendly. We had a server-in-training and she did well. I guess I'm giving 3 stars for the food itself. Nothing really wowed us except for the takoyaki, which we ordered several times.  With so many other sushi places in town, Gorilla Sushi just didn't hit the spot for us as much as we thought it would. It was a drive to come here too and I'm still debating if it's worth the drive to try again. I give them 3.5 stars. Maybe I'll come back.. maybe.",

They would have been a 5 start except that they brought the edamame late and 2 of the rolls ordered one was late. Other than that they were super friendly and gave great service. The setting inside is very retro and relaxing and I would like to say it's a bit of a wooden look. Love that they close late. The food taste is the best and love the name of their sushi such as \"taste like my ex girlfriend\" and \"I love my Ass\" gives it a good laugh while  our looking through the menu which is enjoyable. Most definitely refer this place.  If your going on a date this is a good spot. Especially since their prices are reasonable and one of the cheapest amounts I have paid for sushi. They do have a bar and 2 big TV's. Overall love love love this place would definitely be coming back.",

We picked out a few things on the menu and when we were about to order the waitress asked \"all you can eat?\". Didn't realize that there was all you can each lunch for around $20. Only catch is that it's within an hour but still leaves you with plenty of time. If you're prepared to eat a good amount of food, it's a great option. Even if you're going ala carte it's still fairly priced. The food and portions of each item were plenty and the dishes kept coming out. There's a nice mix of Japanese and Korean choices. Favorites were the Korean BBQ roll, garlic tuna sashimi, and banana dreams roll (dessert). Really enjoyed our experience here.  -Smile when you order",

    "text": "I have been to a lot of AYCE sushi places in Las Vegas, but this place quickly moved to the top of my list in the last few months. I had a friend of mine invite us out to sushi as this place is near his house, and since then we've been back at least 4 times with large groups of people for their dinner AYCE. They also have a great birthday special (free AYCE for the birthday person if you bring 3 other people with you for AYCE).  Firstly, the restaurant is large and well laid out, so it can accommodate small or large parties with ease. Secondly, the service is some of the absolute best i've had from a group of 4 people to a group of 10, we've gotten really great service every time we've gone.  And thirdly, and most importantly, the food! Gorilla sushi has some of the MOST fresh fish of any place i've been, and the fact they have sashimi (1 order per person of 3 different types of fish) on the AYCE appetizer portion of the menu is great too. All their appetizers are well prepared with lots of grilled things, noodle dishes and more along with the typical tempura and edamame.   The rolls are all very fresh and delicious from your standard fare to house special rolls, but what we really really love there is the nigiri. Typically a lot of places have bad proportions for Nigiri, too much rice or thin cuts of fish, but Gorilla has NONE of these issues. They use wonderful thick cuts of fish on just the right amount of rice that's perfectly seasoned. And while all of their Nigiri is great, you must get the SUPER WHITE TUNA. It's the BEST i've had ANYWHERE in vegas or across the US. I am not sure who their supplier is, but it's phenomenal and worth the trip alone.  All in all i'd definitely recommend them for anyone who wants good AYCE sushi in vegas.   Bonus - they do 2 for 1 beer and sake as well.",

The names of the sushi rolls are comical, like the one called, tastes like my ex-Girlfriend. The tv's are on, music videos are playing, sports on the tube.  It's a lively place, it's clean, they're accommodating and the service is always superb. When I'm in Vegas I make sure, we eat at Gorilla sushi.",

AYCE includes: appetizers, noodle soups like udon, salads, nigiri, rolls, specialty rolls, and dessert (one per person).  Some of my favorite nigiri are: garlic tuna, cajun albacore, super white tuna, and salmon. All fresh with good rice ratio.   I'm not really into rolls, but they have a huge selection. I tried the planet hollywood roll and that was amazing! Good thing they offer a 1/2 rolls.   The dessert selection here is better than most places. It goes beyond ice cream and mochi. I got the green tea cheesecake and it was good. They were out of the snowflake the day I went.   Their service is spot on and superior than most other sushi places I've been to.

    "text": "Highly disappointing birthday trip. I have been wanting to come try this place for months. I heard good things, read good things and was excited to have free AYCE on the day of my birthday. Come to find out the free AYCE is only valid with a party of 4 or more and all must be AYCE.   Today was their one year anniversary. Their special was 50% off. Sweeeet! We arrived a little before 5PM and was seated right away. Small place but clean. Vicki was our server. She was. A bit of a airhead. I asked for a high chair for my 22 month old and she didn't know where to place it so she asked us to move to a table in the back. Totally fine with us. We wait for them to get the table cleaned. They moved our stuff. Took 5-10 mins for our new server Clair to one to our table. We patiently waited. Service once we ordered was roughly good given the fact they were a pretty much full house.   We got the seafood nachos which was okay, got some other appetizers and only ordered 3 rolls. Yes, three rolls. We ordered the Grand Canyon, Holy Cow and Tastes like my Ex Girlfriend. Holy Cow was okay, Tastes Like my Ex GF was the best and Grand Canyon was disgusting. It was so bad it left a nasty taste in my mouth for over an hour.   I called Clair over so we can order our dessert and she told us that due to their anniversary they would be really adamant with the hour rule. I said hays fine but 1) we haven't been here for an hour and 2) we still wanted out dessert. I got really offended as there was a table we're next to who was there prior to us and was still there eating and ordered. Um....why you kicking us out 40 mins into our visit when it took 15 mins to move us to a table and get a server to us? We didn't ask to be moved, you moved us!  I definitely won't be returning here. Place was nice and small. But even with the half off price, it was not worth it.   Amy the owner was great, that's the only reason I'm giving 2 stars. She took care of us more than the actually servers.",

Waitress (who was very kind) came by to ask us if we wanted to order anything else and we said she hadn't even gotten her rolls yet. Even after that, it took an additional 10-15 minutes for her to get hers. Apparently there were also 2 for 1 drinks that we weren't told about even though we ordered one beer. So technically should've gotten one free. We both got really sick from the food and had to spend our last night in Vegas sick. My wife couldn't even finish her second roll because she got so nauseous. Hate leaving reviews like this but felt it necessary to warn others.",

    "text": "Gorilla and Sushi? Does Gorillas even eat meat, or fish for that matter? I have read articles stating due to climate change and affects on the seasons, grizzly bears are opting for elderberries instead of salmon. So I suppose gorillas could adapt to a sushi diet if they move closer to the sea.  And in the Planet of the Ape universe, maybe they have evolved to consume a wider range of items for sustenance.  Not really sure, plus I have not even watched that movie yet.   But I am absolutely sure that Gorilla Sushi, the AYCE Sushi restaurant that opened its door for business over a year ago is much better looking on the inside than their low key exterior would hint at.    I never made it to their 50% off grand opening promo, so I never personally experienced the new restaurant hiccup they had to overcome, but on a recent group dinner outing, the Gorilla was impressive in their FOH service level and their sushi chef and kitchen staff did not miss a beat when they received our first orders (even for a group of 11, I thought it was a huge order).  After the first nigiri orders, we collectively placed another huge order just for the appetizers (Soft Shell Crab was totally worth it and served whole).  Our group didn't tackle their Sushi Roll part of their menu as much, but the selection is huge.  Here are some highlights and insights on what we ordered:  Fried Soft Shell Crab - Served whole!!! So yummy and photogenic. O R D E R   I T !!!  Three Sashimi Options to select from per person - All winners, but only offered with AYCE dinner.  Appetizers - So many choices, but if you are here for sushi, try to refrain yourself. On the other hand, it also means your non-sushi friends can come out for lunch or dinner too!  Fish to rice ratio - In favor of the customer, so don't waste the rice.  Nigiri Highlights - Salmon Roe, Salmon, Halibut.  Be organize and prepare with what you plan to order, and obviously order what your party can finish.   Service was fantastic for our large party and on my subsequent visit. I totally look forward to going back, especially if my foodie friends ever wanted to plan a sushi night out.",

    "text": "So overall we were a bit disappointed with this place considering the high ratings Gorilla Sushi got. There were a few highlights; the unagi and Saba sushi were very good. The desserts were also pretty good; the affogato and tiramisu tasted great. Also, the two for one beer was bomb (pitchers and draft beer were 2 for 1!). And the service was excellent, probably one of the best service for an AYCR sushi place. However the sushi was just average in my opinion. We ate the super white, salmon, hamachi, and several others. The fish is very thin and narrow not like other sushi places in town that serve a large portion of fish. Moreover, it just didn't taste very good, not fresh and was just off. All in all, it was just ok. We probably wouldn't come back.",

The oysters were amazing! Great selection, but I would have to say my favorite roll was the King Kong. The service was speedy. My servers were Carlos and Ian, the were on top of it. They did hover a bit, but hey, I've gone to other sushi places and waited so long and had no service in sight. So the good service was refreshing. The manager even came over to say hi. I'm not sure who the chefs were, but omg amazing sushi! This place is a hidden gem. Really good service and quality food. I've been to several sushi places by Spring Mountain that are crowded and have slow service. I live so far, but this is my favorite sushi place in Vegas so far.",

They yell to you when you walk in, the music is too loud, there are tvs all over, the servers are slow and don't remember what you ask for, if you can hear your partner's conversation (spoiler alert: you can't), they also yell to you when you leave ... Which means every time a new customer comes in or leaves, the whole staff is yelling something? We never figured out what they were saying. The food was food. It wasn't super or special, it was just standard sushi. That's what we wanted, so that's fine, but we were definitely glad to leave. The dish names were funny.",

In-house service is so-so...they're nice but often forget your Orders or give the incorrect items. The last straw was when I ordered take-out and was told 20 minutes. I showed up 23 minutes later. They took my money but then I waited and asked how soon it'd be ready. The cashier/owner(?) he barely glanced at me and said \"a few minutes\". He was not at all friendly. I waited 20 minutes...mind you this was 45 minutes after I had called ahead. Then Carlos and John explained their printer had gone down which is why they were behind. Nice to get that info so late in the game. Carlos (very nice guy who's waited on me many times) asked if I wanted a drink for waiting so long. I declined and told him I'm not coming back. So long Gorilla, you have lots of competition close by.",

Management should really have there waiters trained and they definitely should not be drinking on the job even if the customer buys you the drink.   I'm never going to forget my experience here with that waiter Ariel I believe was his name.  So if you want horrible service this is the place to go.",

They have a huge menu with lots of different  choices, appetizers, desserts and even sashimi, you can order anything on the menu and some specialty rolls are 4-6 pieces instead of 10-12 pieces so you can order more. The thing that made me enjoy Gorilla sushi was their creative sushi that were tasty and some even without rice. Rolls like Korean BBQ roll, Grand MGM, Baked Gorilla , Gorilla lasagna, Hello Monkey, Monkey's ass roll, Japanese pizza and Albacore Carpaccio, Bulgogi Nacho appetizer. The servers were really nice,friendly , fast, didn't even have to ask for refills on drinks. Overall good food, good service, nice place and relaxed atmosphere.",

They don't drop anything off the menu like some places do. when I went they were prompt with service and quick to clear the many empty plates from the table. The quality was good as well and were awesome about some special requests we had as well. I suggest getting the pork belly but telling them to really grill it to the point where it's crispy.",

    "text": "A recently opened new sushi place by UNLV area which has a special of 50% off AYCE during the first week. Heard from a friend who went there earlier today for lunch so decided to try it out for dinner   Outside reminds me of Kabuto, a high end omakase style only restaurant in town. Simplistic plain, white walls with narrow windows.... except it all changes when u go inside. Very conflicted decor. Lol. Ceiling had a nice design with the varying height lighting. the sushi bar and the wall behind looked nice with the layered acoustic sound dampening foam lookin like design wall (i dont know how to describe it) Then... u have the cheap bar chairs that look like they are from hawaii, and tables with benches that remind me im in a food court. see? conflicted.....  We were sat at a table fairly quickly and had our drink orders taken. And that was that. Lol. One of my friends had written down our nigiri order on a napkin and handed it to the waitress. It took one or two more servers to ask us before we had actually even received our waters.   Food came out periodically. Fairly slowly. Actually quite slow considering they seemed to have a fully staffed sushi bar with 3 chefs and a restaurant barely half full, if that. The dining room staff was very attentive in repeatedly asking us if everything was ok, by multiple people... but nothing ever came out quicker than expected after telling them we were waiting for our orders.   Fish to rice ratio was pretty decent but fish slice size were definitely inconsistent. Fish slices varied in thickness. Some quite thin. Some quite thick. Their sexy salmon nigiri was essentially a salmon nigiri with a slice of avocado on top, slice of lime without the peel but WITH the seeds, some spicy thousand island-like sauce, and a small spot of sriracha. Quite inconvenient to eat when u have to eventually pull out the seed from the cut slice of lime. Nigiri overall were ok. The most weird one was probably the Ikura. Never had i seen such \"ugly\" ikura. Quite the few were \"deflated\" and \"flat\". Some seemed \"mushed up\". Color seemed a bit off too. Rice was a bit weird in combination with the ikura. Rice seemed mushy in this order. The rice, itself, in the nigiri was ok but would have preferred a little more vinegar taste but seemed to vary in quality over the course of the night. Some was soft, some seemed like it sat out for a while.....   Our 2nd order essentially disappeared, despite being placed to the manager himself. Order was checked on by the servers and eventually the manager. We had ordered the Gorilla tuna, salmon, and yellowtail sashimi as well as some hand rolls and appetizers. Tuna sashimi had some cajun spice on top. Salmon sashimi had some weird sweet sauce on it and cut weirdly.. Yellowtail with ponzu but fairly \"normal\" in that aspect. I had ordered a salmon avocado handroll and a salmon skin hand roll. When the handrolls came, the manager was like, \"oh i had the chef put more fish in the handrolls for you since it took so long\". To be honest, i dont feel like it was larger than how any other restaurant would have done it. Also, my salmon skin handroll became a salmon handroll, with less salmon than my salmon avocado handroll. Lol Friend's agedashi appetizer came before the sashimi's but my green mussels were no where to be found  As mentioned previously, food came out slowly. probably a good 15 minutes or longer between each dish.   We had originally arrived at 8... by the time we got thru our 2 orders... they were asking for last call by 1030. We decided to just give up and go for dessert. Something outside of the sushi chef's realm. It was a choice of either ice cream, mochi, or tempura ice cream. With tempura ice cream, we had a choice of what ice cream, so each of us ordered one as well as other things. The server later came back soon after taking our order and told us they were out of all tempura ice creams and asked if we'd like to order any other ones in addition to what we had before. So we did. When the desserts came out, the ice creams had chocolate syrup drizzled on top. Normally it wouldnt be weird to have this happen but who in their right minds would drizzle chocolate syrup on top of green tea ice cream.... another weird combination by gorilla sushi ! !   Price wise WITH the 50% off is a great deal but you must allocate quite the amount of time to eat. After about 2.5 hours, we still left not really full. Would have loved to order more but they were so slow in fulfilling their orders, who knows when we'd get it... IMAGINE how much worse it can get when the restaurant is actually full.",

My friends and I were playing pool at the Gorilla Cafe and we were told that a new sushi place just opened up a month ago. So  I definitely had to try it out because I eat sushi often and it was also my friends first time so I had to be their \"Sushi Guide.\" Let me tell you.. The sushi was AMAZING. Not very heavy on the sauce, which I like, and the common special rolls like the Dragon, Caterpillar, and the Lisa Lisa was really on top of its game compared to some other places. My friends said it was a great first experience eating sushi and we were glad it had to be that place. Expect us every other week to eat there and play pool at the cafe.   I recommend Edamame and Gyoza to get started. The rolls I definitely recommend are the Philadelphia, Lisa Lisa, Caterpillar, Dragon, Mexican Fiesta, and nigiri would hands down be the Paprika Salmon.",

They forgot a few rolls too. The one guy who helped serve us looked really awkward and didn't know any of the rolls he was giving us lol. But the food was really good otherwise. We made a 2nd order.m and they forgot to put it in or something and they retook our order 30min later. They brought it out quick lol. They're really good at refilling waters.

    "text": "We waited a bit outside because they were swamped for lunch. They were closed and reopened about 6:30, even though there were still guests inside. I don't think they realized unexpectedly closing and reopening for dinner with a huge group can cause more problems than keeping it open. The chefs get swamped and servers run around trying to get everything done at once for every seat that had just been sat.  They apologised for the delay (a lot). Luckily, the servers were nice and the food was pretty good. I was disappointed that the food ran a bit slow (like I said, reopening and letting everyone in at once is like opening a flood gate), our second set of orders finally came through about a little over an hour after sitting, (30 minutes after our last of the first order came in) and a lot of options started running out. Other than that, the food was really delicious and the place has a ton of potential. I had some water spilled all over me, which wasn't a big deal, since our server was probably a little nervous. I just wish the manager had re-seated, instead of me having to ask while I stood waiting for them to finish mopping around me. Also, like I said, a lot of apologies. They should take pride in their work, not feel sorry. It's okay. Spilled water is spilled water. Apologize once, re-seat your guests,  and thank them for understanding. Overall, it was a pretty great place. But I do have to say, the lobster roll was a bit of a turn off. Glad that was the last part of the meal!  Will definitely come back and change  the reviews. :)",
