    "text": "play it safe and stick with some tom yum soup and pad see ew.   tom yum soup was delicious, i like that they bring the hot pot thing out to your table so you can help yourself.  my friend had the pad see ew w/shrimp and i ate more of her food than my own. they give you a generous amount of large shrimp and it goes well with the thick flat noodles, egg, and garlic-y sauce.   i had this rice dish...rice with spicy deep fried cat fish fillets . it was a mess of unidentifiable pieces of fish smothered in brown sauce on top of rice. NO BUENO. and they mean BUSINESs when they ask you how spicy you want your food on a scale from 1-10. i LOVE spicy, so i asked for an 8 and it was borderline that i-cant-enjoy-my-food stage for me.   service was great, my friend ordered this garlic chili beef dish and asked for it to be spicy level 8. she was dying, and i must admit, though delicious, i don't think i can enjoy eating an entire meal like that. she told the server it was way too spicy and couldn't eat it, and they happily made her another order, less spicy. i thought that was super nice of them because i'd probably tell the person \"too bad,\" since they should know to order at their own risk!   Moral of the story: even if you love some kick to your food and (think) you can handle really spicy food, order a lower level...you can always add them to add more spice if it's not suitable!",

I felt like the place is a bit small? Since my neighbor's back is only about half a foot away from mine. Maybe a little rearranging of tables might help with rooms. Our server was nice but from my experience I don't recall him checking up on us. I think we waved and called him to us. Cups of water were small and we never had a refill. My gf had to drink my grandma's cup of ice water since they never refilled our cups for us. I would honestly give it a 2.5 stars but I can't so I'll round up that half star. Little improvement with service, you'll get there.",

The rest of the menu is very exhaustive including Thai and Chinese dishes. The hot pots of soup are intense and delicious, better for parties of 3 or more.  The food is rich and flavorful and none of the staff speaks much English*, which means the cook are Thai and know what they're doing.  *In an effort to not sound offensive, if you want people to speak perfect English get some generic food from Panda Express.",

The food would get a four star, service would get one star..and I'm ALL about service. Anyway the attitude of the waitstaff is \"I don't care\"..they're the type that are only attentive if they feel like it, and if they're not they don't care about apologizing. Kinda like when you're in the checkout line at a store and you tell the cashier you've been waiting for a long time and she ignores your statement completely, rings you up, and sends you on your way. Thats the attitude here. Maybe its because they know they're in a good location, so business will come regardless of a few unhappy people. If you tell them they have horrible service they'll literally respond \"I don't care, we don't want you back anyway\"...then when YOU start to have an attitude one of them will follow you out the restaurant and scream \"Don't come back okay!!\"......thats right, I definitely won't!",

    "text": "Today we tried the tom kha gai (chicken), the panang with beef, and the Rad Na with pork.  I have to say that the consistently good Thai dishes are enough for me to say that this is now my second favorite Thai restaurant!  Oh, and the Thai iced tea here is really, really good.  Perhaps the best I have had!  Very original taste, and just the right level of sweetness.  The tom kha chicken was excellent.  I think it beats even the versions at Komol and Prommares, and gets close to Thai Grill.  Thai Grill's broth is fuller and more sour, but what is great about the tom kha gai at Kung Fu is the super tender chicken chunks.  They must slow cook the chicken somehow, because it simply melts in your mouth.  It was amazing.  If only I could have this chicken in the Thai Grill broth!    The panang with beef was good too.  There was a definite peanut flavor in the first bite or two, but that flavor quickly blended away as I kept eating.  I added chili powder to the curry to balance the slight sweetness.  The pairing of the chili powder taste and the curry was simply perfection.  I wouldn't say that the panang is especially unique in style, but for the style that it is, it is nearly as good as the panang at Komol (which is the best dish I have had at Komol).  The beef was also very well prepared and tender.  As you read on you will see that meat is one of the things that Kung Fu does exceptionally well.  On to the Rad Na! The Rad Na here was one of the few versions that I actually would order alone, and when you can order Rad Na by itself, it must be damn good!  Prommares still makes the best Rad Na in town, but this is a close tie for me with Thai Grill for second.  The noodles were fresh, and the sauce was lightly sweet, and flavorful.  There was lots of bright green, thick Chinese broccoli stems and leaves.  Very fresh and very good.  The pork, again, was incredibly tender.  Very high quality meats here at Kung Fu.   Kung Fu's Thai food is very strong, and authentic.  Every time I come here, there are large families/groups of Thai people eating.  People who don't know Thai food might not realize what they are eating, and I believe that the negative reviews here are a reflection of this.  I can tell you though, if you are a Thai food lover like I am, this place makes some fine Thai food.    On the other hand, the food here is a bit heavier than the food at Thai Grill (and probably TSNH), and not as original as the recipes at my favorite Thai restaurant.  I think Thai Grill is uniquely healthy compared to Kung Fu (and most other Thai restaurants).  Between these two restaurants though, I can thoroughly satisfy my craving for Thai food.  I can't wait to try more Thai dishes at Kung Fu Thai and Chinese, especially the desserts.    Update: Losing a star for a couple of reasons.  I like the curry here, however it still doesn't have the unique flavor that I am looking for.  It is well done, but a little bit generic in style.  Secondly, the Thai menu is dwarfed by the Chinese menu.  I understand that this is where Kung Fu probably gets most of its business, but this means that Kung Fu can't offer as many Thai dishes as it should.  I find myself not wanting to go back because there is nothing new to try.    Disclaimer: this review and the prior one are for the Thai food only.",

After having Italian delivered for the past 2 nights, I was ready for a change.  Kung Fu offers Chinese and Thai.  Their menu is very  substantial.  Their service is quick and efficient (including delivery / driver and phone).  I ordered Penang Beef and Spring Rolls.  Penang Beef comes with Jasmine steamed rice, lovely.    I was really surprised to see so much Zucchini in my Penang Beef though.  My first serving, I had 2 small strips of beef, and the rest Zucchini.  Second serving yielded more beef, but not much.  I think the dish SHOULD have been called, \"Zucchini Penang with Beef\".  I very much enjoyed the dish, and the Spring Rolls though.  I do love Thai and have enjoyed many Penang dishes in the Bay Area.  The spices were perfect (although I was questioned when I said I wanted a \"7\" on a scale of 1-10 for spice).  It is spicy, but not too spicy.    Kudos to Kung Fu for their service.  I would rather have excellent customer service than amazing, knock-me-down food with crappy service.  Their food was good...and service excellent.  In this city, that's great!",

A DEFINITE must-have in your Vegas trip's arsenal of contingency plans for when you are too hung over to leave the hotel for food, too broke or sick of the room service food, and you want variety.  They have an extensive menu, and they DELIVER?!?    I expected the Mr. Chau/Panda Express equivalent of Chinese fast food, so I was not excited whatsoever.  When the boyfriend read off the menu options and said they had an extensive Thai menu as well, I already knew what I wanted: Their green coconut curry w/ chicken.  I don't remember what the hell else everyone ordered, but it was all in my belly quick, and the coconut curry was the BEST I've had, hands down.  The chicken was tender and moist, the veggies were crisp, and the curry itself was a sweet and spicy blend of perfection.  Not too salty, and not too bland.  I was surprised the price we paid, and bitter we wasted almost double that on 3/4 less food from room service the night prior.  We also waited JUST AS LONG for our food, too!    Definitely put this place on your speed-dial when you're there.  It was nice to have a break from the traditional American food fare at all the buffets, and even better: it saved us $$$ when feeding a grip of hungry and broke people chillin' in our hotel room.    Convenience, price, speed, service, good Asian food = 5 stars.",

I would've liked to have the option of making it spicy when ordering over the phone.  Combo chop suey: The sauce and amount was great. If the ingredients marinated in the sauce a bit more, it would've been better, but with a little hot sauce it was awesome.  Mongolian beef was also good with a darker sauce and fried wonton chips sauteed with bell peppers and onions.  Wor Wonton Soup: Probably one of the best won ton soups I've had that wasn't home made. Light, and chock full of veggies and pork and mushrooms. Yum!  One other thing...

    "text": "By far the best Thai food I have EVER had.   My girlfriend and I came in one day wanting to try something different. We love Thai food and either dine at Archi's restaurants or order in from Weera Thai, but ever since we came here last month, I prefer this place over anywhere else.   We ordered the chicken larb, which I can only describe as a Mexican shrimp ceviche except with chicken and a bit more spice. Granted, you can order your food based on a \"hot\" scale and we got the 7. Needless to say I absolutely love ceviche and am now in love with the chicken larb.  In addition to the larb, we also ordered chicken pad thai noodles. We ordered the noodles without any spice and the dish actually had a hint of sweet to it but in the most amazing, warm way. It was the perfect balance between spicy and sweet. All of this comes with a side of white steamed rice but we also ordered two side orders of sticky rice. I've recently discovered sticky rice when Weera Thai mistakenly placed some in my take-out bag and I haven't gone back to anything else since. Im Hispanic so I eat a lot of my foods with tortillas and that's what sticky rice reminds me of. Roll it in a ball, flatten it and grab! I also like to soak it in the larb juice. So amazing!! Also, the best Thai Tea ever and I am not a huge fan of Thai tea.  This is literally the first time I have ever had to tell someone to take a plate away from me or I was going to make myself sick from eating so much.   And, finally, the most important part: the staff.   The staff was so nice! So, so nice! I am a firm believer that you can have the most amazing food but if your staff sucks, the entire experience sucks. I will admit that I don't know much about other cultures or what they believe so I am hesitant when going into restaurants like these because we are lesbians and I've had a bad experience before. But the waitress could not have been nicer. She was so sweet! So, so sweet! Admittedly, I loved this place so much that we went back the next night and brought along my mom and younger brother and hoped we had the same waitress.  Do try this place. Seriously. I have no complaints.",

The bar is sort buried on one side. But you get your food and drinks with no problems. I live for their tom yum, spicy soup with lemongrass. It's awesome. Their dumplings are awesome, their bok choy is awesome, and the prices are good. I don't think i would go there for a nice quiet evening, so I won't. But the food gets 5 stars from me. No question.",

That's what's so good about living in a city where there are hundreds of choices.  I ordered the Green curry with pork--spice level 7 out of 10--and my wife got the Garlic pepper chicken.  We have to remember to tell Asian and Mexican restaurants to leave off the cilantro.  She's one of those strange creatures who doesn't like cilantro.  Both dishes were very good and the spice level of 7 was great!  Perhaps I could have pushed it higher, but this had a good zing and only a few small tears showed themselves.  We ended the meal each having a scoop of ice cream.  I had the mango and Andrea had the coconut.  Mine was very creamy and tasty and hers was, too--I finished hers.  Win- win!  Service was just wonderful.  A couple of people took our order, delivered food, brought iced tea refills.  It was a team effort.  That earned them the 4th star.",

We ordered the barbecued pork as an appetizer, and shrimp with lobster sauce, General Tso's chicken, and Mongolian beef, as the entree's. Barbecued pork was tender and tasty. General Tso's chicken was cooked properly (crisp on the outside, tender on the inside), but tasted more like sweet and sour chicken (as it did not have the usually red hot peppers, so it was not spicy at all). The shrimp and lobster sauce was good, although the shrimp could have been a little larger and the removal of the tails would have been better. The Mongolian beef was also good, but many places in Vegas/Henderson make Mongolian beef as good (or better). I have eaten in some geat Chinese restaurants in New York, and China, so take that into consideration in reading my review (as my expectations are high). I think overall, most people will enjoy their meal at Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant.",

I left them $1.50 in quarters which they didn't even deserve . Personally i work hard for my money and if I don't think you deserved at tip I don't have to give you one !!

I wanted dessert but it was getting late for the kids in our party! This place is super easy to find: on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View!",

(no, you can't substitute shrimp for chicken) it took us forever to get our food, and even longer to get the check. not to mention the food came out staggered, my husband got his entree, then they brought out the appetizers, then another entree... food quality was not good; very bland and not fresh. no condiments on the table, and not even enough for each table. they also didn't have enough menus for everybody.  over all appearance and quality of the restaurant was poor.",

For starters we got a chicken larrb salad, then Beef pad sieew (Beef Chow Fun) and chili mint beef. Everything was very flavorful and delicious. I also happen to see a guy I went to high school with who is now a drummer in a famous band, but that's another story. Another tasty place for Thai food.",

Absolutely delicious atleast until the day I picked up my food as a to go order. I live near red rock and I had to drive all the way across town for my Chinese food so you know it must be good. Anyway I picked up my order got back home, I went to taste my tum yum soup and it had a roach floating at the top of my soup. I could have died. I drive back across town and returned it to the restaurant, they told me that the cook must've thought it was garlic and accidentally put it in my soup.... Wow I wonder if this happens often??????

Always a warm greeting when entering and seated immediately. They do have a bar area with seating, however the tables are flushed against the seats- don't expect to sit at the bar anytime soon.  Portions are to be shared, or not if one is hungry and then you can surely have it all for yourself.  I have!  The three times I've been here the food comes out quickly after ordering and steaming hot!  They are also very accommodating when switching something for your tastebuds. Three stars, since it's not my 'N.Y. Chinese' food.   That being said, I've more than likely made an attempt at most of the Chinese places in town.  This is the only one I enjoy.",

She just kept saying it was too spicy for him and didn't offer to get him a new one or anything. She kept arguing it. On top of that, our dishes weren't any good either.

How does a Chinese restuarant run out of egg rolls before lunch. I ordered a seafood noodle bowl and they forgot the shrimp. And last but not least, the waiter instead of walking around the table to serve a plate to someone seated across from him he leaned over someone else's plate.  She told the waiter three times to walk around but he ignored her. I also believed his shirt fell into her food. This plus super slow service, I'm NOT going back.

Since I'm always game to try things that people seem to be so passionate about, I thought why not?  First I will say that the parking was a bit confusing. Kung Fu is located in a strip mall on Spring Mountain but the actual restaurant faces Valley View. You can't actually see it from the parking so you really have to know that it's there or you would totally miss it.  After looking through the pretty extensive menu we decided on the Crab Rangoon for an appetizer, the half duck and the chicken Pad Thai. Well one of my pet peeves is when the appetizer arrives the same time as the entree which is what happened here. I still can't figure out why anyone would rave about the duck. It was super rubbery and none of the fat was rendered. The Pad Thai was solid however but not enough of a reason to come back. And lastly, the service was not very attentive. We even had to wave someone down to get our check.  China Town has so many great restaurants in the area but this one is not going to be on my radar in the future unfortunately.",

    "text": "Kung Fu Thai & Chinese is a Thai and Chinese restaurant located on Spring Mountain Rd. I went with my party of four to this restaurant on Sunday, January 3 around 11am. The style of service here is family style, but there are entrees for one serving available as well.  Atmosphere: Vibrant, Organized The decor of the restaurant seems to be based around Thai decor. Upon entering the restaurant, the decor is vermillion-colored. Nothing too flashy, but there are pictures and statues that seem to be Thai-themed. Nothing too obnoxious or flashy, but there is just enough decor around the restaurant to catch your eye.  Service: Good!  Upon entering the restaurant, we were seated immediately at a booth. When were seated, however, instead of the waiter asking us for what we wanted to drink, he just gave us all ice water. We were able to ask for hot tea (which one of us wanted) later upon request. The table where we were seated had plenty of space for us to sit. We took our time finishing our dishes, and when they needed to be cleared, they were cleared with efficiency. The only thing I did not enjoy would be the busser stacking dishes at the table. He should have brought a cart or a tray in case something might have splashed on us.  Food: Well prepared, delicious, and memorable We ordered the crab ragoons as our only appetizer. They were crispy on the outside with a creamy filling. Six were served to us on a bed of shredded cabbage with a side of horseradish sauce and sweet and sour sauce, both of which complimented the ragoons very well. What I liked about the service when we ordered the ragoons would be when the waiter told us that if we order wontons they would be plain and if we order the ragoons they would have filling. This was very considerate of him.  The two soups we order were the wonton soup and the tom yom with \"big\" rice noodles. The wonton soup came with shrimp, pork, carrots, baby bok choy, scallions, and pork wontons. The wonton soup was decent, but needed some salt and pepper. The tom yum we order was medium spiciness and came with fish balls, imitation crab, some ground pork, bean sprouts, scallions, and a fried wonton on top for garnish. The tom yum was incredible: full of flavor, a little savory with a complimentary kick of spiciness.  The dishes that we order were the chicken pad thai, Hon Sui Tofu, and beef and broccoli in oyster sauce. Chicken pad thai came with purple cabbage and parsley on the side. The pad thai had a good amount of chicken and seasoning. The Hon Sui had great juiciness in the tofu and great flavor in the meat: totally delicious and savory. The Beef and Broccoli was probably my favorite dish; the beef's smokiness and seasoning was absoutely amazing. The Beef and Broccoli in oyster sauce is a must try!  Overall: Good experience, would go again! Although the service was not great, the food we were served was some great Asian cuisine. The food was probably some of the best I've had in a while. Visit this place for some great Thai and Chinese food!",

First off they have an awesome lunch menu with multiple options for under $7 and it includes soup of the day and some killer little appetizers.    Of course we can't be as simple as their lunch menu we opt for the bigger is better option and order directly off the menu.  I ordered the chicken pad Thai and my man had the combination pad Thai.  We split a bbq pork fried rice.  Needless to say we had a ton of left overs as we could have split one meal and been full.  Everything we ordered was great!  Loved the delicate sauce on the pad Thai.    Can't beat the location as it's just off spring mountain and valley view.  Just west of I-15 on the Spring Mountain exit.  The service was great.  The guys who assisted us were happy and friendly.  Great Thai find in Vegas!",

I say this because half of the booth still had food on it, I love my husband, but we were sitting uncomfortably close to avoid sitting in someone else's dinner.  Their menu has 600 items...Ridiculous.  it looked more like a Harry Potter novel then something that should have food items.

We stayed at The Hard Rock and they have Chinese food there but its expensive and nowhere as good as Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant !! We had both Thai and Chinese. The fried rice was light and not heavy with oils as many seem to make.It was so flavorful. When we first walked in the smells wafted in the air and we knew right away that we found the best! Worth the drive from the overpriced strip and an Uber ride is cheap and with the money you save by not paying over inflated LV strip prices the Uber ride ends up almost free. We will always stop here each trip we make. This was our Thanksgiving mealand one I will always remember. Thank you to the cooks and all the nice people we met there!!",

    "text": "I would love to give 5 stars, and if it was based off strictly food and price it would be. Very affordable and very good food. Some of my favorite fried rice in Vegas and hard to put down once you start eating. I haven't sat down to eat here yet but ordered take out a few times.  If they are not busy, take out is fairly easy as someone usually sees you walk in and comes to help you. However on busy nights such as this past Monday, I went in to pick up my food and waited about 10 minutes before someone acknowledged me being there. I then waited close to 10 minutes for them to ring me up in the back along with another guy who was there before me while our food sat there bagged up on the table. Food was still very hot when i got home so no issues there, just think they should have a dedicated \"host/ess\" when you walk in. If you walk in now, it's like whoever is available will come over and seat you or take your order.  Seemed like many of the people sitting at the restaurant were frustrated with wait times for food or service as well. Saw one guy get up and go grab the water jug from the server stand since nobody was coming to his table to refill and one table had to grab a server so that they would take the order for the table.  Minus the obvious service issues on busy nights, I highly recommend this place for the food! We have enjoyed all dishes we have had and I absolutely love the fried rice.",

The seating is actually pretty quick depending on the time of the day you show up.        We alwayse order yum moo yang( grill pork sald) it is sooooo delicious :) a good blend of sweet and heat. There soy sauce duck is also yummy, especially over hot steamy rice.

After waiting for ten minutes to get our drink order taken, we were greeted by the rudest server ever. He kept getting our order wrong and had to repeat several times. Two of our plates  came out in a timely fashion, but we waited for all plates to come out so we could all eat together. Not an unreasonable request. 30 minutes of waiting for the rest of our order and our waiter hadnt even come to check on us. There had been 3 parties seated and served in the time that we were waiting. After 45 minutes of waiting for the other 4 plates, we asked the  waiter if we could just pay for our drinks because we weren't  going to pay for food we hadnt receieved. Somehow they magically had two more of our plates ready as we were standing up to walk out.  The waiter first tried to ignore our request, then hid in the kitchen. We were very calm in out request and just kept getting blown off. A lady came out of the kitchen and shook her hand at us as to dismiss us. Thats when our waiter came out with our checks for our drinks.   We paid for our drinks and left.   As you can imagine, we wont be returning. What a disappointment!",

At 9:00 I called to check on the status of my meal, they said a driver was out with it. At 9:45 I called to check on the status of my meal, they said a driver was out with my food.   On pressing them, they asked the driver (Who was actually at the restaurant), and then insisted several times I had signed for the food. When I sternly pressed that I had not received the meal, they had put the driver on the phone. The driver immediately described the wrong house and gave me my neighbors' address (The store owner had the right address, which was not my neighbor.)  The driver then suggested, an hour after he had delivered it, that I should go to my neighbor's house and ask for my food.      After having ordered here for at least five years, I would have at least hoped for a discount or a free appetizer. They charged me full price for the meal and offered to remake it and redeliver.  I think most people would have declined the charge outright.    I hope they manage to sort out their drivers. Almost four hours for a meal is insane. Furthermore, they did not deliver the correct drink. Whatever they brought was orange and sincerely undrinkable, at least to me.  The food itself is excellent, Garlic Pepper Beef is an absolute favorite of mine and the Crab Rangoon is delicious.",

Food always comes out quick, so you're never waiting a year for your food to come and never will you have an empty glass. Just doesn't happen here.  I will admit that I generically order the same 4 things (with other new dishes) every time I come to Kung Fu:  1. Mongolian Beef - NOTHING...and I mean NOTHING- tops their MB. 2. Tom Yum Soup with Tofu - I cry because San Francisco doesn't know how to make it like Vegas does. I have tried numerous Thai restaurants in SF and gave up because they all use some kind of tomato tasting broth that totally turns my taste buds off. It was heartbreaking when I moved away from LV. Kung Fu knows exactly how to make my spicy and sour broth!! (Try Komals if you want the very best Tom Yum in LV) 3. Orange Chicken - Very strong flavored orange glaze over crispy chicken. YUM!!! 4. Thai Vegetable Fried Rice with egg - love it!  While visually its not the greatest looking restaurant, don't mind that because what's looks got to do with it?!?  Service always weighs heavily on my mind when forming opinions about restaurants, business etc. that I go to, and I can't emphasize enough that the staff here just gets is right- 100% of the time...for me anyways, but maybe the just like me ;)",

My sprite (which I got with a Yelp check in) was pure carbonation and with very little to no \"sprite\" syrup.  You can order most items with our without \"spicy\"  Chicken Wings:  Very good crispy but tender.  The sweet chili sauce had no heat to it but it was delightful.  Pad Sew Ew:  Pretty solid as far as this traditional Thai dish goes.  Nice flavor, not too much overpowering sauce.  Shrimp Salad:  Refreshing and light.  Shrimp with a light sauce on a bed of lettuce.  The salad was crisp and the shrimp were cooked well.  Shrimp Fried Rice:  Really no flavor at all.  I give them item a 1 star at best.  I've had fried rice at a lot of Thai restaurants and this dish had no flavor whatsoever.  Chicken with Basil:  A little greasy but very flavorful.  The basil flavor really pops out.  Just sop up some of the grease with your steam rice to balance it out.",

    "text": "I have been here 2x in the last year. When I come to Vegas, I ALWAYS need to eat noodle soup a few times. You will find me in China town once a day during my visits. MY favorite is the beef ball noodle soup. I got this both times visiting here, and i'm always shocked to see the tiny bowl of soup that comes out. This little bowl is nothing like what you see in the Bay area in California. But for Las Vegas, I suppose this will do.  The first time I was still hungry when we left, but this time, We all ordered the crab papaya salad as well. With this and my noodle soup, I left happy and content. The soup was a little on the sweet side which I am not accustomed to or favor.  I ordered my soup without bean sprouts, and it came with bean sprouts , I also asked for extra cilantro and they didn't give me any..  If you are not sure what you are craving.. you will definitely get lost in this menu. This thing is like 10 pages long, ranging from Thai curries, to soups to Chinese fried rices and more dishes!  Come prepared with an idea of what you want..  I'll probably try some more Thai places in the area next time I'm in town before coming back.",

    "text": "Unmistakably Kung Fu Thai is a hidden gem amidst the easily overpriced Asian cuisine in Las Vegas. Step one to finding delicious and affordable food in Vegas is to get off the strip. So, that's what my family and I did by coming to this restaurant, located in Vegas' \"chinatown\" or along Spring Mountain Road.   Come here a little before the usual dinner rush on weekends about 6 o clock to avoid waiting. Right after we arrived, multiple parties came and had to wait for a table because the whole place filled up so quickly.   You must try the garlic beef, pad thai, and papaya salad. Each dish was executed well and the food was brought out fairly quickly.   My family ordered 5 dishes for 5 of us and there was still some left over. The total came out to be under $60 which is really not bad at all.   This place is now on my list for some good Thai home cooking if I'm ever sick of the buffets and sky high prices on the strip.   P.S. Check in for a free drink, +$1 if the drink is Thai iced tea!",

Did an Internet search for places that deliver. A million pizza joints, but I wanted something different. Came across some good reviews for Kung Fu so I placed an online order.  About two minutes after the order was placed, a gentleman called from Kung Fu to verify some of the things on my order. Whhaaaaat? A restaurant that doesn't just guess but actually follows up with the customer? Amazing! He told me the food would be delivered in an hour but it was more like 30-45 minutes.  And it was sooooo good. I was craving egg drop soup and theirs didn't disappoint. I had also ordered the chicken with chili and mint over rice and received a HUGE portion for the price. Got a large drink too. Cost for everything plus delivery and tip was only about $22, making it more than worth it. Not to mention the awesomeness of having it delivered to my hotel.  Definitely will be keeping this one on my list for future trips to the area. It's easy to understand why they've been open so long!",

The white rice and lo mien were good. Delivery was on time. Overall, I didn't get my marinara sauce, extra soy, or extra duck sauce that I asked for.

When I got there friendly greeting by the host but than when it came to the server; he got to our table gave us waters and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else to drink but automatically asked if we were ready to order our food . Excuse me first thank you for the water but shouldn't you ask if I want something else and than out of that time getting our drinks give us time to look at the menu. Than when we actually placed our order I understand that there specialty is tom yum soup so I understand they have a big batch ready to go; what i had ordered was tom yum, Mongolian beef and shrimp fried rice . So I understood the soup was coming out ahead of the rest but 20 mins ahead come one I didn't order much and I don't only want soup . Thru out those 20 mins of just having soup he did not once come once to ask if we were ok or if needed anything else and I observed around there was a big party 8-12 people who look to be enjoying there food and I seen when they brought there feast in and so I was ready for mine . Than when I finally became annoyed of just having soup 20 mins I finally decided to cancel the rest of my order. Than when the server asked why I stated that I didn't just want soup than he tried and justify by saying the soup always comes first which I told him yes the soup maybe ready before because you have a big batch but it's common curtesy you bring all food together just like they brought the huge party the soup with the rest of there food . My mom wasn't a big fan of the soup so when I said \" ok wait for the rest of the food\" and 20 mins passed and I was eating the soup by myself believe that ; that was not the lunch I wanted to have with my mom on our day off . Point being soup was a 2 1/2 out of 5 . & I will not be coming again and will not recommend.",

I knew what the outcome was going to be when I looked up the Yelp reviews for them. I wasn't going to have a great lunch is what I predicted.  Our Lunch Order as follows: 01.  Tom Yum Soup w/ Soup - 2 Stars - Probably the worst Tom Yum soup I've ever had. Watery in taste and only had mushrooms. I think we ordered the Shrimp one but do you see any floating or drowned shrimps. Neither did we. No heat, no flavor, the flattest soup ever  02.  Water Spinach - 2.5 Stars - One of my FAVE Asian Veggies if not my FAVE Thai veggie dish. It was limp and watery. No flavor that seemed to come to our taste but just bland. It tasted like steamed Water Spinach.   03.  Pad See Ew (Beef) - 3 Stars - Probably the best dish of our lunch. At least it tasted more like what Pad See Ew should taste like but theirs was more on the sweet side.  04.  Beef Salad - 2 Stars - CHEWY Beef and not even spicy. It kinda like a non-Thai dish to me. Just horrible in taste. We didn't finish it.  05. Chicken Basil - 3 Stars - 2nd best of our meal. It was really sweet and not spicy as most Chicken Basil is. The hint of Basil wasn't enough to give it a fragrant smell. Was hoping this dish was better than the rest.   06.  Sweet & Sour Chicken - 2 Stars - This took 30 minutes to come out and when it finally did, it was such a disappointment. SOGGY, SWEET, and STICKY. 3 \"S\" is not ever good. The kids didn't even like it. Another one we tossed away.  07.  Some SWEET Fish they recommended - 1 Star - Couldn't even tell it was fish, it had some weird sweet sticky sauce that was just too hard to eat through. The fish had a lot of bones. This was the 2nd WORST dish of our lunch.   08.  Thai Ice Tea - 3 Stars - The only thing that tasted authentic today.   CUSTOMER SERVICE - HORRIBLE and they were so slow.  FOOD - Nothing there was authentic. I get it, it's a touristy area and loads of buses come through here. Anywhere that is a combo of 2 countries, usually isn't good. In this case, it was absolutely True...NOT GOOD.  VERDICT - Never coming back and Never listening to my friends that recommended this place to us. I cut them some slack, they are not Yelpers so failures like this could happen. Won't happen again, though. Thanks but NO thanks!",

    "text": "After trying a couple of disappointing Chinese delivery options I stumbled upon Kung Fu Thai and Chinese restaurant. I saw a menu laying around and decided to check it out. After see6that they had fried calamari, I knew I wanted to try them out. But it wasn't only the calamari that caut my interest. They had an assortment of really delicious looking dishes and a wide variety of seemingly authentic Thai dishes. For my first order though I decided to stick with two things I was familiar with: almond chicken, and of course the fried calamari that piqued my interest in the first place. They delivered the order in a timely manner. I was going to order a soda with my food, but the nice lady who took my order over the phone suggested Thai tea. So I went with that instead. Well, finally I got a meal worth my money. When the delivery guy came with my food, I asked him if the iced tea was good. He laughed and answered \"yeah\" as if it was the most ridiculous question anyone has ever asked him. The iced tea was four dollars and change and didn't disappoint. It was sooo good That I drank it down before I thought to take a picture of it. It was a two-toned color. I think it was mixed with milk. So creamy and delicious. I should have got the jumbo sized one instead of the large.  Worth every penny. The fried calamari was fried to a golden brown, succulent, and came with a sweet chili dipping sauce, as well as a great hot mustard sauce and a couple of other sauces. The almond chicken was great with plenty of vegetabluit next time. I fully enjoyed this meal and can't wait to try some of their more authentic Thai dishes in the future. Your Kung Fu is very good!",

Sonny, our usual waiter, always guarantees us  amazing and fast service. Food usually arrives about 8-10 minutes after an order is placed and they are constantly refilling drinks and making sure that the customers are satisfied and There has never been an issue with our order. Kitsna is also an awesome server here. Prices are reasonable for the quality they provide although a bit pricey. 10/10. Would definitely recommend.",

They were not even that busy they were just being fucken lazy.   They gave us the wrong order and still charged us $40. We were waiting for the pork belly and mango dessert,  but said it would take another 29 mins!? Only thing we got was plain sticky rice and salad. Took another 20 mins for them to give us our change too.  Seriously I never seen so many lazy ass people in a restaurant before in my life until I came here, I would never come back obviously. They were rude and the food taste like horseshit. I was in a big hurry otherwise I would of fought my case.",

    "text": "This is an Asian restaurant that offers a Thai and Chinese menu. The restaurant looks old and outdated, however, the food is very good. I was also surprised with the portion sizes as they were pretty generous at a reasonable price point.   We ordered the Tom Yum Kha which had a very traditional Thai flavor. We also ordered beef and broccoli, pat see ew and the Thai beef salad which were all good choices. The best dish was the combination fried rice which was very tasty. We also had the sweet green chicken curry which was somewhat of a disappointment and I would not recommend it. I guess the part that I did not enjoy was the fact that they used cucumbers for this dish.   Other than the curry, the flavors were great with mainly all of their dishes. So whenever you cannot decide between Chinese or Thai food, you can come to this restaurant and have the best of both worlds! Again, not a fancy place but this is a good and reasonable priced restaurant.",

If you can handle spice, get the minced chicken basil with white rice.  It's really yummy. I also like getting their pad se ew and egg flower soup.  Not every visit was a hit for me, one time the Tom Yum soup pot they gave us was cold/lukewarm when it came out.  It was unusual and I wasn't sure if it was supposed to be like that.  When I finally decided to ask, the staff only offered to heat up whatever was left in the pot.  That ruined our meal experience a bit.",

When a booth became available I asked to move and was told no. That pretty much ended my liking this place, but wait- maybe the food will save it?  We ordered a sampler appetizer plate. It was good and I really liked the shrimp. I grew up eating at a Chinese restaurant that was a family favorite and they were very much like my favorite place. What I ordered for dinner was not as satisfying in fact I was going to give the leftovers to the crazy homeless guy outside on the street but I didn't. It didn't get eaten at all.  No one that works there is very friendly unless you are a regular.  overall we will not return. (luckily, my husband liked what he ordered and ate it all)",

The multiple groups of people that came in and sat down after us all got their orders and drinks immediately and before we did. With us being the only people of color in the place, and seeing everyone else treated promptly, it's hard to not feel like it was because of us being black. My boyfriend ordered the simple thai chicken and it took them forever just to come back and say that they didn't have the chicken for it, so he had to order something else and wait longer. And when we did get our food it was not good. I asked for the check and it took another 15 minutes. What was a 30 minute meal for every other customer, it took us 1 hour and 20 minutes for a simple meal. Ugh this place... never again!",

There really isn't anything that was truly amazing here but in this place's defense, everything was consistently good.  Not amazing, just good.  A lot of solid expected sightings like lo mein noodles, sweet and sour pork, kung pao chicken, & eggrolls.  Again, nothing that I had was amazing but I was very pleased with the more than acceptable quality of the items available.  Nothing seemed to be sitting for long periods of time and all of the foods were being served at the appropriate temperature.  Overall: Decent offering of Chinese buffet food at affordable prices.  Great place to stuff your face full of okay food.  Thumbs up for not making me feel like puking afterwards as most low end Chinese buffets do.",

Though I did notice that the restaurant was packed with a diverse crowd of non-Asians.  Therefore, I have mixed feelings about this place because food is good, but being in the heart of Chinatown; I'm certain there are better options/hidden gems around the same price range.   We didn't love the broth of the vegetarian Tom Yum Kha soup bc it lacked coconut milk. From the reviews, it seems like the non-vegetarian version is the way to go.  Our main dishes were much better, getting usuals like Pad Thai, Chinese Cabbage, and Beef & Broccoli.  Spice levels range from 1-10.  Ps. bathroom lines can get as bad as a theme park wait because there is only one bathroom per gender.",

The place was packed, but they found a small table for the two of us towards the back. They offer a free soft drink with a Yelp check in, and I was able to \"upgrade\" to a Thai iced tea for $1 instead of the normal $2.85.  Deal!  Today we ordered a cup of egg flower soup, egg rolls, shrimp Pad Thai, and Mongolian beef.    I thought the egg flower soup was gross, but I'm not a fan of that style of soup anyway.  My fella LOVED it.  He said it was some of the best egg flower soup he's had in town.   The egg rolls were amazing, and let me tell you about the hot mustard sauce...wowza, THAT cleared my sinuses after one bite.  It was absolutely amazing, and I usually don't care too much for hot/spicy things.    The Mongolian beef was delicious:  tender beef with great flavor and a little kick to it, with peppers and onions and carrots.    The Shrimp Pad Thai was good too...the noodles were perfect.  My only complaint and the reason for the docked star was that the shrimp were REALLY over cooked.    Service was extremely polite, and quick.    I absolutely plan to continue to order in from here, and I would definitely dine in again.",

I just can't remember what they called it! I'm glad the waiter knew what I was talking about! It was delicious!   My brother had the Sweet and Sour Pork ($8.75). You could tell that this was made fresh because it wasn't Chewy and soft. It was crispy on the outside and tender on the inside. We also ordered a side of egg rolls for ($6.95) . I liked that the rolls had clear noodles in it because I don't see that often.   The service was also prompt and friendly. We didn't have to look for anyone because they constantly checked on us.

    "text": "KUNG FU KICKED TO 2 STARS     Kung Fu Restaurant broke an important rule. That rule is to NEVER EVER force your customers to leave a minute after giving them the check. Breaking this rule has consequences such as A ONE STAR REDUCTION IN A REVIEW RATING. As a result of their unprofessional action a 3.4 rating is dropped to 2.4 stars that is rounded off to 2 stars. Yikes! kind of how my brother and I also felt. In all honesty this a gentle response considering that many talented Yelper's would reward this experience with a one star rating.     Kung Fu Restaurant is located in the Las Vegas Chinatown District at the southwest corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain Boulevard. After a day in Springs Preserve suffering with a hurt left foot my brother and I decided to drive a few traffic lights South on Valley View Boulevard to Chinatown. This would be a convenient choice. Actually not really. Regardless that Kung Fu is at a major crossroads, the parking situation is atrocious. The diminutive parking spaces are more ideal for a golf cart than today's modern vehicles. I'd sacrifice my car if I left it there. So, we parked across Valley View Boulevard near Starbuck's with the intention of a post dinner coffee after. So I'd sacrifice my legs and limbs crossing a busy Valley View Boulevard.    The service started out allright. Immediately after walking inside there was a booth available (I wonder why). The waiter presented my brother and I with glasses of cold water and the menus.     Regardless that there was a large assortment of dishes to choose from, only the entree page dishes included jasmine rice. Nothing about brown or fried rice. I ordered the shrimp chop suey which was around $9.50. My taste buds say that the shrimp chop suey is 3.4 stars. In comparison to the Chinese restaurants that I have reviewed (my Chinese Restaurants list is the home of these reviews) the size of the shrimps trailed in comparison. Generally speaking, or tasting the quality from the vegetables to the sauce tasted fine. The soy sauce gave some taste to the jasmine rice.  With the shrimp chop suey and jasmine rice, I ordered hot tea. In my opinion it is nearly impossible to mess up the delicious hot tea that Chinese restaurants serve. After a few cups of the delicious green tea, I stand by my opinion. Thanks to the Yelp checkin offer, the tea was complimentary. I would of enjoyed a bowl of my beloved wonton soup,  one of my favorite foods in the world going back to my toddlerhood. But Kung Fu doesn't give any breaks with the soup. The war won ton soup is around $9. they ought to include personal portions of soup on the menu. Then again, they ought to include chopsticks on the table.     The food was good. I ate everything down to the plate including the sauce. My brother and I were talking at the time the waiter presented us with the check. Around a minute later the waiter tells us to pay because people were waiting for the booth. He wasn't giving us the stink eye and handed us our fortune cookies. Without a nasty demeanor he just rushing us out of the booth barely giving my brother and I time to split the bill.     I didn't read the fortune cookie. An appropriate fortune cookie would say something like, \"The average person tells nine other people when they are unhappy with a business where the average Yelper tells a couple thousand people when they are unhappy with a business.\" Or the fortune cookie might of said, \"You have a World of restaurants to choose from in your city.\" Or the fortune cookie could of said, \"There is nothing like competition.\" To close off this review, what I am saying is that Kung Fu rushed us out the door of their restaurant and it is a door I don't intend to open in a long time.",

We ordered the Wor wonton soup, Mongolian beef, General Tso's chicken, and shrimp lo mein.  The flavors of the dishes were great and the plates were not heavily sauced (a personal complaint I have of most Chinese dishes).  It was pretty busy for a Sunday late dinner crowd, but we were served quickly and the staff was very friendly.  My only complaint was the barbeque pork in the wonton soup has the orange rind and it maid the soup look pinkish (it made it look unappetizing).  Besides that one complaint we loved coming here again after a long absence and will come here again for Chinese/Thai food!!!",

I was craving tom yum soup and while going through their extensive detailed menu, I noticed they had tom yum NOODLE soup......never had it before so I decided to give it a try.    We started off with papaya salad (medium spicy) with salted crabs.  I kept thinking the sliced green veggie was peas and wondered why the hell the salad was so damn spicy, turns out they were chilli peppers and NOT peas. ....oops.  the salad overall was tasty, fresh, and delicious.  Moving on to the best noodle soup I've ever had in my whole entire life: TOM YUM NOODLE SOUP.  Words cannot express just how amazed I was.  It was extremely flavorful with the right amount of spices and the noodles were perfectly cooked.  I'm constantly looking for cheap flights so I can fly out there just for this.    Service - You're average asian restaurant.   Poor guy had to go back and forth with our orders since we kept asking him for extra stuff.   But my experience here was pleasant.  I will definitely be back next time I'm in town.",

    "text": "If I could give this place zero stars I would. I rarely ever write reviews for any businesses but this restaurant stole my money and the money of two of my co-workers as well.  We decided to order three lunch specials online on their website and paid for it no problem via Paypal. We receive a phone call shortly after from a woman who refused to name herself and she stated that \"Oh sorry we don't serve lunch specials on the weekends.\" We ask if she can make an exception and deliver our food because we already paid for it.   \"No, we can't make food for you. We don't serve lunch specials on the weekends.\"    Then why is it available on your website? Why were we able to pay for it? Granted, we did not see the disclaimer on their website that said \"Lunch Specials are only available M-F 11:00-3:00PM\" --but then why is it available as an option to purchase on the website at all times?   I also ask if there is any way we can just go pick up the food or if they can refund us our money. The woman says \"No we can't make food for you.\" She then says \"You'll get your money back when the manager comes back...but I don't know when he'll be back.\" Um? Excuse me?  I ask her when the manager will be back and she says that she doesn't know. I then ask her if there's anyone else we can speak to. She says no and that she is the only one in the restaurant.   How is this poor disgrace of customer service the only one at this restaurant? There are no chefs to cook our food? Seriously? Maybe that's why we can't get our food.  We even offered to pay extra to get the regular entree portions of the food but she again repeats: \"No food for you.\" She then states \"Don't worry, don't worry! You'll get your refund. I'll let my manager know. Not sure how long refund take.\" How very reassuring.   Shortly after speaking with me she hangs up after stating that \"There is nothing I can do for you.\"    Well, if there's nothing you can do, there's definitely things that I can do. The business is being reported to the Better Business Bureau and a dispute was also opened on Paypal for our refund. All we wanted was some damn food.",

    "text": "Please note this review is only for delivery - I've never eaten at the actual restaurant.  Tough to review this place on just a * rating, so let me explain:  1) Chinese dishes are Thai-style, so extremely sweet. 2) Thai food is decent enough to satisfy my fix, but not a lot of variety. 3) Ingredients (esp. vegetables) seem fresh / good quality. Seafood combo dishes mostly imitation, however. 4) Portion size varies anywhere from meh to very good; meat ratios vary even more wildly. 5) Online ordering system is fantastic for convenience. 6) They deliver fast and have never gotten the order wrong, and reliable delivery is a rarity in Vegas.  Ya, probably averages out somewhere a bit above a 3*, but I think rounding up to 4* is a bit too generous especially since I avoid the Chinese food. Despite any negatives, the Thai food is flavored right and that's what counts. With the convenient ordering and reliable delivery, still good enough to make the rotation for our office's lunch delivery.",

    "text": "It's surprisingly difficult to find places that deliver in Vegas. Everyone in the office is completely sick of Jason's Deli 3 days in a row, so we tried something different and so glad we did. I've only had the Thai food from Kung Fu, but it's one of the few places in Chinatown that delivers, and figured we'd give their food a try.  We did the order by phone since it was catering, but I was really surprised that their website allows you to do the order online for delivery or pick up. Helps a lot with the language barrier - I don't speak Chinese or Thai, but my coworker made me order (in English!) because she had trouble understanding them.   We were able to feed 12-14 people for about $160 which is really good. Delivery was on time and there was no minimum or delivery fee. I wasn't blown away by the Chinese food, but it was above average with generous servings at a really reasonable price. I think each half pan was around $40.   It's not my personal go-to for Chinese or Thai, but the fact that they're cheap, so close to the strip and have delivery makes this place 5-star if you're visiting. Beats paying $25 for sweet & sour chicken from a casino restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I were really were looking forward to a good meal in Chinatown.  We came upon Kung Fu Thai & Chinese and checked it's rating in Yelp.  We entered the establishment, 2 of us, and there was a party of 3 behind us.  The waiter said to us, \"Take that table there.\"  He pointed to a table by the wall, and I asked if that was the table he meant.  Yes!  He proceeded to seat the party of 3 while we seated ourselves, and he then brought us menus and took our drink order.  The menu is quite extensive, but we decided on appetizers of crab rangoon, bbq pork egg foo young, and Thai beef w/vegetables.  The table had been previously set with lunch size plates.  The waiter brought the appetizer, set it down and left.  We mixed the sweet & sour sauce with the mustard sauce on our plates and ate the crab rangoon.  It was just ok, but my husband removed half of the filling because it really was way too much in the won ton.  This extra filling he put on his plate.  We now have lunch plates with sauce and filling sitting in front of us.  The waiter returned with our food and just sat it on the table and left.  Not a word, no eye contact.  We looked at each other and said, OK, and proceeded to place our food and rice on the dirty plates.  Every wait staff in the place refused to give us any type of eye contact or acknowledge us.  My husband finally said, \"Do you get the feeling we are not wanted here?\"  \"OMG, Yes!\" I said.  It was so uncomfortable in there.  No one ever came over to see if we needed anything or to refill our tea.  To say the least, this was the worst Chinese and Thai food we have EVER had!  The egg foo young was so bland and almost had a water taste to it.  The brown gravy on was in was tasteless.  I actually added table salt to my beef and veggies in order to try and liven it up a bit.  We wanted some soy sauce, but do you think any person would even look at us?  NO!  BUT, when it came time for us to leave all of a sudden we had all the smiles and help we needed.  Someone actually refilled our tea!  And, everybody was trying to wish a good evening, etc.  Guess the thought of a tip was overpowering to them.  Surprise!  The tip was $3, which was way too much!  My thoughts?  Stay away from this place as I am sure there are some fabulous places in Las Vegas for Thai and Chinese food!",

B/c of some of the meals I've had and not enjoyed, I marked them only a 3 star place.  Also, the restaurant isn't the cleanest and the decor is old.  I will say though that their Beef and Broccoli is very good, as well as their Chopped Chix Soup and their Hot N Sour Soup.  They offer a Thai and Chinese menu there, and we always tend to order from the Chinese side of the menu.  They have a really good hot sauce there so make sure to ask for that.

I went with my good gf and we had a quick lunch break to chat and enjoy good cheap eats! This was the lunch time and considering it being the peak time where people from office or casinos have their lunch break most restaurants were not open? It was odd so we knew that Kung Fu had never let us down and was great to eat. We had the lunch specials where you can have a soup, egg roll and chicken wing with steam or fried rice and an entree of your choice. The entree was either Chinese or Thai to choose from. And the order was quick and fast. There were several patrons there on their lunch break too and looked like they were having the lunch special too?! It's only $7.25 and anything other than the lunch special depending on the entree should be around $7 and up. They also deliver! That's an added Plus when you can't get out of the office and or job. Super recommend!",

My husband said, \"Don't look down.\" Good advice.  Moving beyond the floor, which I am sure at times is immaculate, we came in to try some Thai. When I go for Thai, I go for curry. I ordered the panang tofu, as that was the curry listed under their vegetarian selections. I forgot to ask if they were able to do soft tofu instead of fried, and the dish came with fried. I thought the tofu was perhaps over-fried, as the texture was a bit chewy, and the flavor a little greasy. As for the curry itself, it had a very heavy peanut flavor. Based on what I know, the inclusion of peanuts in curry is sometimes a personal preference of the chef, and some people may enjoy the flavor. However, for me, it was overly sweet and the curry was incredibly thick. I kept telling my husband that it tasted like peanut butter and tofu, which wasn't pleasing to my taste buds. This is not a dish I would order again.  The service was efficient.  One bad dish and some lackluster floors creates a less than ideal first impression. Still, there is a whole menu of potential, so as I said in the beginning, I'll stay neutral.",

The Thai wings and fried shrimp were just huge blots of fried  cold batter.... lots of dried out boiled rice and two very small containers of tasteless, limp cold food.  THEN they hit me up for a $4 delivery charge............  GO TO WEERA - HEARD EXCELLENT THINGS AND WILL TRY IT NEXT TIME.  KUNG FU THAI - YOU SUCK!!!",

    "text": "Our very asian looking dealer at the Rio Casino told us to come here for good thai food. I thought, GREAT! A local recommending a good thai restaurant - it MUST be good. she also recommended the stuffed fried chicken wings which also sounded bomb.  GPSed this place and went with 4 other people. I first looked for the chicken wings under appetizer and found it: Stuffed fried chicken wings (2). WHAT THE HELL. 8.95 for 2 wings? Whatever, we ordered it anyway since the dealer recommended it. I ordered the laad na with beef (flat noodles topped with gravy sauce with beef), my bf ordered the pad thai with chicken, my other 2 friends ordered pad see ew with chicken, and the other ordered roast duck over fried rice.  First of all, let me just say, it took almost half an hr just for the waitress to come to our table to get our order. Second, it took another 45 min for the food to come. The thai ice tea came out pretty quick though and was pretty tasty.  The stuffed fried chicken wings came out first. Man, that was a small portion. We all took 1/5 of the wing and it was mediocre.  30 min later,  My laad na was finally came and was DISGUSTING. I dont think ive ever had nastier laad na than this place. It was bland, the noodles were not pan fried at all, and the beef was dry and overcooked. My bf's pad thai was soso. The pad see ews came with 90% noodles, 5% veg, and 5% chicken. The duck fried rice looked disgusting also. I think the only tasty item in this restaurant is their thai ice tea.  -2 for food, - 2 for service, and +1 for thai ice tea.",

Because all the positive words don't reflect anything if the food ain't good! Just bcuz someone else had a positive encounter doesn't mean you're going to have the same and I have realized that I am just going to order with whoever I choose, because it's a gamble either way. I read the reviews first and the food was still garbage. $27.00 down the drain, cause I literally threw away both entrees, the combination fried rice( the rice had absolutely no flavor and the meat was regurgitating), and the combination platter(appetizers),. the shrimp, egg rolls, and the potstickers and thai chicken were absolutely horrifying. I couldn't digest nothing of the entire order. Never again will I waste my money, I cannot believe Las Vegas and the hype about everything being the best and the food here has been GARBAGE.",

This was the only place I could find on the book that deliver Chinese food where we are so I took my chances.  I ordered satay chicken, shrimp pad thai, mongolian beef, shrimp Thai fried rice, whole deep fried catfish, chicken panang, papaya salad and steamed rice ( I know it sounds a lot, but I also have the parents w/us), bill came up to $72.  The satay had a good flavor and not dry like some places.  Their menu said the shrimp pad thai and shrimp fried rice comes with plump shrimp ...what we got in these dishes looked very small and not as advertised---very disappointing.  The flavors were good though but they shouldn't have underlined \"plump shrimp\".  The cat fish was very good and almost made up for the shrimp.  The papaya salad had a good flavor but I would have liked the papaya shredded thinner.  Everything else was so-so, I've had better.  My dad liked it for the spiciness.",

The food is delish it's always made piping hot and the sodas are great never flat they have a great soda machine .. Mc Donald's better watch out lol  We also like to order take out , the food travels really well and it still tastes fresh !! Our family who lived here in Nevada before us , introduced us to this fine restaurant and ever since then we loved it ! We love the chicken chow Mein , the chicken pad Thai noodles , the chicken fried rice and my ultimate favorite orange chicken . They have a really good spicy scale it's not American therefore its spicy  .. last time we got a seven spicy and my tongue was on fire !! But it was soo good !! This has got to be one of my most favorite restaurants in Las Vegas ! We used to go to the noodle house on the other side of the shopping center until the quality of food went down after management change .. I'm soo lucky we found this place when we did .. cus man we are hooked .. Thanks to the owners for working so hard and making such delicious traditional Chinese and Thai food we love it here !!",

    "text": "As I walked into a surprisingly full dining room of a Thai restaurant in a town well-known for Thai food, I built up expectations of a great meal. I didn't get one.  Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant was actually an impromptu plan B. We wanted to go to another Thai restaurant on the other end of this extremely long and narrow strip mall on Spring Mountain. However, this came with a personal recommendation, so it seemed viable at least. Entering the Valley View-facing front door of this business and seeing the packed house, it was natural to hope for something special.  It took around 10 minutes to be seated during this dinner rush - and a manager or employee claimed that this was actually a slow night. Speaking of slow, they took a while to get around to taking our order. That wasn't so bad for a first-timer trying to decide on what to choose from the vast menu of at least a hundred items. Thankfully, they did get our food out in a reasonable amount of time.  Papaya Salad ($8.95): julienned papaya, sweet coconut sauce, ground peanuts, ground dried shrimp, tomato, and evidently some chilis. All of the ingredients were fresh, especially the crunchy papaya. The spiciness was quite problematic, though. I called for a 3 out of 10 but variance was huge. I took several bites with no lingering heat at the start, but some later bites incinerated my mouth. It averaged out to at least a 5.  Pad Thai w/ \"Certified Angus Beef\" ($10.25): the beef is at best a little above average, but I don't have any beef with the marketing ploy. The problem is that the Pad Thai tasted like a Chinese bastardization of this fundamental, foundational noodle dish. I didn't taste such key nuances as fish sauce and tamarind. The end result was on the sweet side and was enjoyable enough, but it wasn't Pad Thai.  Green Curry w/ pork ($9.95): I didn't have as much of an issue here as my dining companion did. It was a solid curry with bamboo shoots and zucchini, and a side of white rice. The only noticeable downside is perhaps the unremarkable pork. I was also curious as to the lack of yellow and red curries on the menu, and considering the inauthentic dish above, I'd wager that they just don't have that depth of recipe knowledge in their kitchen.  I don't see what draws the crowds to Kung Fu Thai & Chinese Restaurant. They simply don't hold to candle to other local Thai restaurants both inexpensive and extravagant. Maybe it's their close-to-Strip location, along with their sign perfectly positioned to catch the eye of those driving down Spring Mountain. Maybe it's their decades of presence and the loyal if misguided long-time patrons - surely, fewer options were available way back when. As for me, one try was enough.",

Usually quick to seat you but ordering is awkward. They are not flexible on a few things I've requested even when I said I'd pay extra the server didn't even try and just said no.   Decor and seating is nice compared to other places nearby.   Location is the worst to find parking though, just don't be in a hurry.   They block calls from people that hide their numbers. As a BUSINESS they should respect my wish to not have my number tracked. The owner could not give me a reason why they block the calls but did say he won't change it. So if you call several times and it's busy that's likely why.  I tried them again today and I had to ask for my hot tea after waiting 6-7 minutes after ordering. Never came back to see if I was good. Had to ask for the check.   Better choices in Vegas for sure.",

This is a great place to take those who love chinese and Thai and those that are a bit hesitant toward trying exotic foods. My mom is super plain jane and I can eat something tasty here while she can also play it safe with more traditional foods.  The Mongolian Beef is not to be missed as you can't go wrong with it. Egg drop soup for the table is great. I personally enjoy their Thai food immensely, particularly their curries. The Mint chicken is also great. There are just so many options, I could go on forever. Definitely worth checking out!",

    "text": "We went to our favorite restaurant in China town in honor of the Chinese New Year celebrations going on downtown over the weekend. I have to admit, I was disappointed that there wasn't a special offered or some type of unique meal for the occasion. But none the less, we all decided to try something different than our \"norm\" on this trip and it was Tom Yum Soup with Shrimp - we've always seen and admired it at other people's tables, so decided to give it a try. On the scale of spice, we asked for medium. I'm not much of a spicy person - medium turned out to be way too much for both my mother and I. In fact, my sister, who loves spice, tried it and it was way too much for her. It ended up ruining our dinner this night. My lips were numb from my small sampling of it and I couldn't taste anything more the rest of the night.  We were surprised that it wasn't crowded when we arrived, however, by the time we left almost every table was filled. Although I've given the restaurant four stars, this night didn't really deserve a one star. It took 30 minutes for someone to take our order. Others arrived after us, received their food before us and were on their way out the door as we were finally being served our main course. For me - this is an automatic negative review for me unless circumstances occurred causing the delay. But this was before the place got really busy. It took another 30 minutes after we were done to have our table cleared and ask for the bill. And another 15-20 minutes after receiving the bill to flag someone down to take our payment. I think we only saw our waiter once the entire night. The rest of the servers were people we had to flag down for one reason or another.   Although the soup ended up ruining the rest of the meal, I can tell you the food there has always been wonderful! Appetizers of Crab Rangoon, Calamari, Wings (really good), Satay and combo platters have always been tasty. We make it a must to have at least one appetizer each time we go. The Pad Thai is really good - they even give you a choice of the type of noodles to have with it. Mongolian Beef is awesome! So is the Ginger and Pepper Pork/Chicken or Beef (we've had one of each). Egg Fu Young (whichever type you have) is moist, delicious and so flavorful. Overall - we really love the restaurant. Just wasn't at its best this past Saturday evening.",

I told her that \" a lot can change in seven years\", and I was right.   We both agreed that this was one of the worst Chinese meals we ever had.  The staff did try to please, but they just could not over come the bad food that came out of the kitchen. We ordered a curry dish, kung pao chicken, and a shrimp dish.  My wife took one look at the curry dish and said, \"When I saw it, I knew we were in trouble.\"  She was right. Poor quality ingredients, and no taste to it.  The Kung Pao Chicken, a standard which I use to compare Chinese places, was awful. My dogs turned down the left over chicken; The peanuts were few, and tasted like they were purchased from a ball park, six months after the season ended, and the dish tasted liked it was cooked in Motor oil.  Remember those terrible shrimp that are in those 99 cent cocktails in Downtown Casinos? Ever wonder where the ones they reject go? This is the place!!  Top off the food with booths where the fabric is torn apart and needs replacement, and you risk sitting with a spring up your butt, and you have a perfect picture of  Kung Fu Thai and Chinese.   Go across the Street to Krung Thai. Better food, nicer place, better prices, and much easier to park.  Trust me, I wanted to give this a Zero, but I am required to give one star. Generous.",

We knew we were at a great Asian restaurant when we looked around and noticed we were the only two non Asian people in the place.

They tasted very fresh and flavorful. The portion sizes were considerable so trust me you will be taking some home.

Chicken with mixed veggies = a whole lot of veggies, no chicken?!!!  So to sum it all up, slow service, flavorless food, and no chicken!!!!",

The service is friendly and usually prompt. The food comes out as it is prepared, so sometimes it's a little weird to get a dish every few minutes. But it always comes out fresh, hot and delicious. We haven't delved into the Thai side of the menu, but we can vouch for a number of dishes on the Chinese portion of the menu. The General Tso's Chicken is our favorite, as well as the Sesame Chicken, Mongolian Beef and the Combo Chow Mein. Parking is a pain, but worth the hassle!",

Suggestion on how to get there if you're staying on the strip: Take the free shuttle from either Harrahs or Ballys to Rio and then walk about a quarter of a mile up valley view rd. to Kung Fu. Believe me, its worth the walk. Delish!",

We ordered 2 plates of fried rice, 1 plate of kung pao chicken, 1 plate of spicy cat fish. We then added an order of shrimp. After waiting for close to 45 minutes!!!!!, and watching other people getting served who came way after us, and multiple enquiries, we got only the shrimp dish. Again after multiple queries, we got the full order, but only one serving of rice. The catfish was burnt beyond imagination. The shrimp tasted like a reheated plate...very leathery and burnt crispy. An old lady (may be owner or management ) asked us \"how was it\"...we said we are really disappointed.  Her response..\" you still finished your food, didn't you\"...!!!!!!",

    "text": "This is a review of their take-out service; I'm sure the experience is different in the restaurant itself. Also, I'm not entirely sure if the take-out menu has all the items that are in the in-house menu. I have never been to the restaurant itself. Decided to try the take-out menu because one of us was feeling sick and was not up to going to the casinos for a meal. We were staying at a timeshare near the strip that did not have room service.  First, I tried ordering online because they have a convenient online ordering system through their website at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkungfuplaza.com&s=fea0783041e2bf06f5724c0c0349792993db223b4f8ddc1b87174784edd62cc4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kungfuplaza.com</a>. The ordering system was very well organized, with pictures of the food you're ordering. However, after putting in my order, the final page indicated that the delivery address was my credit card's billing address which is in another state and not the hotel that I was staying in. I cancelled the order and called in the order instead. The woman who took the order had a strong accent, but she got my order right. The woman asked for spiciness level on a scale of 1 to 10, with one being really spicy. I was quite tickled by this method. Food arrived exactly an hour later as promised. There is a charge for delivery; I think it was six dollars or thereabouts. If paying by credit card over the phone, the delivery person will ask to see the credit card that you paid with along with a picture id.   The dishes were good; nothing spectacular, but sufficient for a take-out. The seafood tom yum had very little seafood but quite tasty. The roast pork noodle was okay. Pad Thai was quite good, and so was the beef larb. Portions were good, neither too little nor too much.  Thai iced-tea was delicious. The restaurant included Styrofoam bowls and plates, and plastic forks, knives, and spoons. They also did not skimp on the paper napkins, fortune cookies, and hot pepper sauce.  All in all, a good take-out experience and I would definitely order take out from them again. For the four dishes, drinks, a side-order of  steamed rice, and delivery charge, dinner was about fifty dollars.",

We shared chicken satay and fried won ton as appetizers, and shared three entrees:  chicken with spicy garlic, sweet and sour pork and seafood pad thai.    Our waiter was new to the job and had to be urged to check with someone to give us information about the drinks at the bar (rather than just saying \"I don't know\" and leaving us with that) but he redeemed himself by returning with the owner, who explained the ingredients of the pina colada, and told us that the pina coladas and mai tais are the most popular bar drinks requested.  As far as cleanliness, the nasty-looking carpeting was a problem. I believe the furnishings were rather worn-looking as well, but the space is brightly lit and relatively spacious.  The decor was nothing to write home about; the place is basically a white box with decorative Thai art and dusty-looking travel posters on the walls.  But we came for the food, and I must say that everything was delicious.   For all of the above orders, a beer and a Pepsi, the bill came only to about $50, which isn't bad.  We all said we'd come back.",

The 'mixed veggies'  with it were very sparse. The sauce was so-so.  The spring rolls and papaya salad were decent... no better than other places.  The veggie glass noddle soup was a load of noodles in a tasteless broth with lacking veggies.  P.S. I thought about a return visit to try other dishes but I would much rather go to Komols, Ping Pong, Hue Thai or Veggie Delight. Always good.",

I can't stand the name of the restaurant, but the food is not too shabby. A few years ago, I thought this place was the bomb, but I think because of the combination of food we ordered, I left feeling underwhelmed. It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so spectacular either. This restaurant offers both Thai and Chinese cuisine.  Gotta have Tom Yum. We ordered the seafood. For 13 bucks, they didn't give us much soup, and the seafood was sparse, but it tasted alright.   The Pad Thai was decent. Kind of hard to mess up pad thai.  My sister ordered the Cashew Chicken. This was just an average dish.   The Pan-fried Catfish was everyone's favorite. The fish wasn't perfectly fried by a long shot, but the sauce was very good. I'm not sure why it says that the sauce is \"curry like\" on the menu, but it was a bit spicy, and the basil added fragrance. I love spicy!   Ok, let me tell you about this dish that hubby ordered. He has a history of ordering bad dishes. This was the Pa Nang Curry with Beef. It was like scooping a spoonful of peanut butter into my mouth. My mom said it was \"so weird\" in Vietnamese. It was.  Lots of photos and full review on my blog.",

We ordered our food online 2 hours ago and still NO FOOD. we just called and they clearly have no idea that we even ordered, we've talked to 3 different people in the past hour about our food. The last time we called she offered to retake our order and start from scratch. Meanwhile, the credit card was charged for food we never received. The lady took our number and said the \"computer is broken\" and the boss will call me back later for a refund. Worst experience i've had with lunch. My lunch hour is now :(",

NOT a big fan of asian cuisine since its all rice,noodles and strange meats I tend to stay away but I played it safe with an appetizer combo,BBQ Pork fried rice and wor wonton  soup. Delivered to my door in 25 minutes for under $30!!  The fried rice was good but nothing special-very little pork and the rice was just ok. NO crunchy noodles for the Wor WonTon Soup when I requested them was a big downer:( The soup was really good however.  The appetizers were ok I could have ordered a dozen of the wings and been better off however!! The other stuff was forgettable even looking at the photo I cant rememeber what it was:(  Alot better places to try in Chinatown but you live you learn.",

Lucky me!  We ordered: Beef sate' Tom yum goong Tom kaa chicken Mint chicken Pork plik king Curry catfish of some sort Red beef curry I was very impressed with all the above dishes. In fact I came back the next day just to try the pad see ew, and that was also very good. Well balanced flavors with just enough kick for this westerner to get a good idea of what they are working with.  The Thai iced tea was also prepared very well and had way too much milk just the way I like it.  The only thing that was lacking was the interior was a bit dated. But im not here to eat the painting on the wall. Also the service was not as attentive as I would have liked. We had to wave down the waiter numerous times. And lastly the food is a bit more expensive than I expected.   But the food is very good. Kung fu may not sound like an authentic Thai food restaurant but damn the food is pretty good. So ignore the name and concentrate on the food. Positive note for next time: Looks like they have a full bar.  Food: A Service: C Price: B Overall: Solid B+  Now go eat and be merry!!!",

What can cleanse your palate better than a steamy bowl of spicy tom yum soup? Our Thai friend told us about this place and we were surprised how good the food was. My second time eating here and the business name still throws me off. Pretty authentic Thai dishes, which reminds me of a few spots in Thai Town, Krung Tedd and Hollywood Thai.   The waiter let us know up front that it's easier for them to add additional spicy than to remove it. We understand dude, haha, we can handle it.  Favorite: Tom Yum Soup - chicken or shrimp Crispy Pork with Basil and Chili Papaya Salad  Food - 4.5 stars Service - 4 stars: we had to flag someone down for more rice then later for our check. Parking - the parking lot stretches along Spring Mtn Restroom - 3 stars Wait - came during lunch time and were seated right away",

Service depends on who you get as your server. But it's not like they are really bad. We once wanted one of our dishes kinda customized and the server helped us do it, and we had a great deep fried Calamari in butter sauce. Amazing!!! The food is always great, nothing to complain there. If you love Thai food and want a good authentic taste, this is a sure hot point!!!!",

    "text": "I wasn't feelin' Thai food but after a weekend in Vegas, the one dollar sign was what attracted me most.  We had a group of 11 and the restaurant was able to seat all of us at one huge, round table.  We decided to order separately (instead of family style) and I shared with two others.  Between us three, we ordered:  -Tom Yum Soup (with Chicken): I specifically ordered \"spicy\", on a scale of 1-10....10!  It turned out, this Thai joint ain't no joke.  They really hit you with the hotness!  The spiciness I was fine with...but it was too overpowering and left the soup flavorless.  Next time, I'd probably order a 7.  I definitely recommend the Tom Yum Soup here because they give you an abundance of meat and mushrooms! -Pad See Ew (with Shrimp):  was decent, but they give you so much shrimp and it's such a good price that you can't not order this.  Our leftovers hopped on the car ride back to San Diego with us and we had it for a delicious dinner.  Two meals for the price of one?  I like.  Great tasting leftovers?  I love!",

They will charge for extras and give you less rice altogether in a bigger bowl. Each entree comes with 1 cup of rice and charges for more if asked. Rice isn't that much more but $1.50 per extra cup but if you were to get your 1 cup in the first place you most likely wouldn't need a second cup. Overall food is ok.",

The chop chicken chili is my favorite, spicy level 8... Anything below isn't very spicy. The Mongolian beef spicy level 8 is also really good, as well as their Thai Teas. For quality of food though and variety this place is one of the best.",

Business has been around for 42 years and now I know why.  The owner greeted us halfway thru the meal and couldn't believe it was my first time to visit her establishment.  She informed me all dishes are made to order with an option on every dish of 1 to 10 on how spicy you like it.  You can definitely taste the difference in the pride and quality of the food and service.  Will be back again!!",

We enter and it's pretty busy, but no line at the door so it seemed like we were going to get decent service.  Damn man. We got seated and we were promptly brought water however we waited about fifteen minutes for someone to come by to take our drink and food order. After about twenty, a server finally came over and took everything at once.   After another fifteen minutes, still no drinks so I got up and asked where they were, and as soon as she brought the food is when we got our drinks. The food was decent, however we had to get up, travel to a dirty table, and get our own soy sauce. Also the portions were pretty small. I ordered the general tso chicken and she had the bbq pork wonton soup.  The food like I said, was decent. It's just the service was so awful I couldn't take it, I honestly considered just walking out. There were only about 4 servers on the floor and obviously they were very overwhelmed. The bussers were amazing though, they really hustled their asses off.   Next time hopefully the management staffs up for higher volume because I know this place has been in business for a long time and has great potential. Perhaps on a slower day we will check them out again if we are in the area.",

We still order take out most of the time here when craving for Thai food. 4 stars because I still love their food.",

There was no one there so it was not busy one bit. Our appetizers didn't come out first so we sat there starving the whole time and when we asked someone to check on our food, she never did. Our server was no where to be found. The pad Thai I ordered with a spicy level of 4 had no spice in it at all! Decided to ask for chili instead of waiting longer for them to remake it. I suggest ordering take out if you decide to eat from here. Not worth the wait and being put in a bad mood because the service is so shitty.",

There was nobody there so it should of been fast. So we sat our selves and after 5 minutes my son got us our menu's. Then after 10 minutes, another couple came in and was seated and given menu's and ordered their drinks. So the same waitress came to us. Asked us are we ready to order. I said finally we can. It been ten minutes for you to get to us. She said it's ok if you can wait. My wife was no it not ok. This is the first time I had experienced this bad service here. I was already mad about it. Then when me, my and my two younger kids ran out of drinks nobody was refilling it. So, I got the waitress next to us and asked to refill my drink. When she came back and ask her to refill my sons. When she came back from that. I  asked her to refill my two kids drinks.  After we where done eating our meal. We asked for four boxs. So this lady start to put the food into our to go boxs and spilling our leftovers all over in from of me. I said I guess you are not getting any tip. Now the food we order was good. But for all of the services problems. I will not be recommending this place. Food is good but other places that good too.",

The people who work here are not only friendly but usually quick about coming back to the table to check on you or clear plates. I've also never had to wait and the ambiance is a little more intimate than some of the other places nearby, such as Pho Kim Long (not that I have anything against that place).   As for the food, the portions are usually pretty big so I always recommend getting a few things and sharing \"family style.\" One of my favorite dishes is the Chicken Satay. The sauce has a sweet flavor as well as the cucumber salad that comes with it. Delicious! Don't worry, if you aren't a fan of sweets or are trying to eat healthy they have plenty of tasty options such as a big plate of steamed vegetables! The menu is huge so there's definitely an option for everyone. Enjoy!",

But this place is WOW!  I have been by the restaurant but not inside (yet!). However, every-time I am in the area we get $100s of delivery. I must say everything is 5 STARS... the speed the food temperature the crispy and rich textures and fresh flavors are all there. Utensils dressings condiments taste homemade the packaging is handled with care and attention to details - the delivery driver is always positive and polite. We ordered here for Christmas for the whole family and they even threw in some surprise gifts for us.  I have nothing but positive things to say about this place and have shared it with most of my friends and family when we are nearby.  Thank you for great service KUNG FU THAI!

Votes in - and THAI food it is! But where? So I remember heading out to Chinatown in a prior visit to Vegas a couple months back at Kung Fu! CHEAP, GOOD, and did I mention...GOOD! So 15 minutes later we're there and were seated promptly. Luckily, it was already after lunchtime  so we didn't encounter any wait time.  We all chose to order dishes and share the portions. Tom Yum (HOT - of course), Pad Thai, some beef salad, and shrimp fried rice!  The guys were digging the food but like myself, they agreed the service was aiiiiight! Could have been better (hence the 4 stars). SO - if you're in vegas and have a hankerin' for some Thai/Chinese (good decent and reminiscent of SGV style) hit Kung Fu up! It'll make you say....\"HAAAAY YA!\" LOL!",

They were so friendly on the phone, very helpful with directions.  The food was great and everyone was really satisfied at the end of the meal.  They were very accomodating with plates, forks, napkins, and even provided serving spoons which was really nice.  Why not 5 stars?  I had called about 45 minutes ahead.  When we arrived to pick up the food at the agreed upon time, it quickly became apparant that they hadn't even started preparing it yet.  I think they didn't believe we wer going to actually show up.  So we had to wait about 30 minutes, which was kind of a drag.  Other than that, great experience and I would definitely recommend this place, and go back if the opportunity presents itself on a future trip to Vegas.",

(4 in total)  Kung Fu Plaza brands itself as a Chinese-Thai eatery, but my experience has been that its Chinese dishes do not taste authentic at all.   The chicken noodle soup is extremely oily, to the point of being inedible. I had ordered this for a sick friend, and was quite unhappy about its quality. The wonton soup is much better, but nothing above the ordinary. The hot and sour soup is nowhere near the regular Szechuan version that you would expect - this one is orangey-yellow. The chow mein is passable, but your best bet is probably the thai curries, which are quite tasty, and as a plus, taste good as leftovers.  What I do like about them is their cheerful and quick service.",

    "text": "Having a craving for Thai food in Vegas once again, my friend recommended yet another she was familiar with. So far, I think you can't really go wrong as pretty much all the Asian restaurants I've been brought to has yet to disappoint me. This place was no different.  It's one of the typical informal Asian restaurants you'll find in Chinatown....dated decor and nothing 5 star about it. That's fine as these places are frequented for the food and not the decor. Not to say there isn't any atmosphere as there's hodge podge of Thai and Chinese antiques and motifs.  Like most Asian restaurants, it's probably best to go in larger groups as there are so many dishes to try and the portions are quite generous. Since it was just my friend and I, we just ordered the fish cakes, Pad See Ew (fried flat rice noodles) and the Pad Wan Sen (fried clear noodles). The flat rice noodles was pretty good, but just a bit sweet for my taste. I had actually ordered the fried clear noodles which were quite delicious. However, I had just had this this dish at another Thai restaurant a few days ago, and the other restaurant's taste edges out this one a bit in terms of taste quality. Still good though, and a good sized plate of noodles. The fish cakes were not too bad either, but for some reason parts of it were dry or hard to the chew.   For a good Thai and Chinese restaurant both in one, and not too far from the strip, then this is definitely a place I'd come to again. Service was good (likely because it wasn't a busy time of day), good sized portions, and the food was worth the money. The other Thai restaurant I really enjoyed was a good 4-5 miles from the strip in a suburban strip mall, and probably a bit too far from the strip to venture out to, unless you have a car and GPS. This place is convenient.",

They finally let me use it and what's funny is that nothing was unclean and also after making a slight scene one of their workers suddenly decided to roll a mop bucket toward the restrooms at that time.

    "text": "Solid three stars over all, although 2/3 of he dishes we had were closer to four stars.  We had a 1/4 of duck, crispy spicy catfish and a Thai shrimp salad.  More than enough food for two, with leftovers  to take home.  The catfish dish was great, and the salad very good.  We ordered them at a 5/10 spice level which was a moderate and very manageable spice level.  The duck was not bad, it was somewhat more of a steamed than roast duck although the skin was crispy, possibly tasted steamed because it was set in a watery cabbage base, and the homemade sauce they had for the duck was excellent.  The duck did definitely need the sauce because it lacked flavor otherwise.  This dish was over all more of a three than a four because the duck didn't taste out of this world fresh, but then neither did it taste old and freezer burn like the duck you might get at many Asian restaurants.  (Good duck is hard to come by at any restaurant, since it is typically frozen.)  We also had a nice large pot of tea, more than enough for two.  Service was a little spotty, at times they were right there, at other times such as when we needed extra napkins, was hard to flag anyone down.  Restaurant was fairly busy on a Thursday night.  Over all an enjoyable experience at reasonable prices, and we would go back.",

    "text": "Where to begin... first off, I haven't been to Kung Fu for a while because of the last bad experiences with them. This place was my favorite place to eat thai food but their customer service hit rock bottom.  Me and my family came in and dined in on Saturday, June 8, 2019 around 8:30 p.m. with five people including myself. We sat the left side, the bar side. We ordered many dishes, they were: - Thai Coffee - Beef Pad See Ew - Chicken Pad Thai - Small Shrimp Fried Rice - Chicken Satay - Beef Papaya Salad - Chicken Green Curry  I was absolutely shocked the cleanliness of the table was dirty before we sat. I had to ask our server to clean the table before our food comes because it was sticky. Seriously! Who wants a sticky table right?  All the foods were very delicious, no complaints on that. But the service was bad. We had to ask many servers for napkins and yet no napkins. Even asked one of the manager, didn't even dare get it. One of us had to grab the napkins from their pantry.  If you want good thai cuisine with good service and cares about their customers, especially if they are a LOCAL, I recommend to eat somewhere. I have been a local for over 20 years in Las Vegas and this used to be my favorite thai place to eat and have a good Thai dining experience. All well, there's more places I can explore.",

It is not frenetic during lunch like many places in Chinatown. The menu is MASSIVE and includes options from both Thai and Chinese cuisine. Also, good deal on lunch specials. I ended up trying their panang curry with chicken. Very flavorful, but be warned: very spicy! In general, panang curry paste tends to be mixed with chili so it usually runs hotter than other curries. But I can usually handle it. I added no extra spice, and my mouth was burning! So, naturally, I needed to cool off with some mango & sticky rice for dessert. That was delicious! All in all, cool, chill place. A bit slow on service, but otherwise they are very nice and go the extra mile to pack your food to go.",

It's tucked away on the left side of the building on the corner of Valley View and Spring Mountain in Chinatown. It's a good size restaurant with a lot of tables and we were seated fairly quickly. Our waitress wasn't very friendly and we just got seated and didn't get a chance to look at the menu and she wanted our order already. She came back in a few minutes and I had questions about an entree and she really couldn't answer my questions. Other wait staff was really good in their service. So we ordered Fried Shrimp Rolls| Panang Yellow Chicken Curry w/ Zucchini| Jumbo Shrimp w/ Mixed Vegetables| Larb w/ Chicken. For dessert we had the Thai style Mango with sweet sticky rice and coconut cream which was really good. My favorite was the Panang curry chicken. Everything else was good.",

Had to flag down someone to refill water several times 2.  Waited 40 minutes for our entrees.  Watched other parties who arrived after us get their food. We flagged down someone to check on our food and they said it's coming.  My husband was so pissed after the 3rd \"it's coming\" that he got up walked over to a waitress in asked for the check to pay for our apps.  As he's headed back to the table (smoke spewing from his nostrils upset) our food food mysteriously appears.  He tells them he doesn't want it and explains why.  The waiter has the nerve to say \"we were holding these until you finished your apps before bringing out the main dishes!\"  We had wontons and egg rolls for apps, it doesn't take 40 min. to eat those, plus he lied!  The  food was piping hot so they weren't holding anything.  The wait staff isn't coordinated at all.  They're all over the place around there.  3.  The food: glass noodles with chicken #189: I asked for spicy, it was bland but decent flavor.  I would order again when this place get their act together!  Drunken noodles #184:  not enough noodles.  Get rid of the bed of lettuce on the bottom of the plate.  What's the point? To absorb the obsessive amount of liquid is my theory.  Flavor was okay, but no spice...we requested spicy! Jumbo shrimp fried rice: bland, flavorless, and they forgot the spice AGAIN!  Disappointing especially after a 40 minute wait! 4. Payment:  we give the waitress (a different one again) the credit card.  She asked for an ID, no problem.  She doesn't walk towards the register, instead she stands next to our table and stares down.  She stares at the credit card way too long!!!I finally asked her if something was wrong.  She said she's just checking the name.  It doesn't take 5 minutes to check if the names are the same.  Don't stare at someone's card here in Vegas like that.  Looked like she was trying to memorize the credit card #!!  Would I go back? No, not any time soon.  This is the 2nd time I've had terrible service here.  I was forgiving the 1st time.  The menu has 1000 items (no exaggeration), maybe the should slash the menu and focus more on the customer service and over dining experience.",

I'm new to the neighborhood and I'm on a mission to try all the Asian restaurants near me.. this is the 2nd one and I was definitely anticipating it, but actually ended up a little disappointed.  The pictures I've attached look way better than how the food tasted.   First off, the service here was great!!  I ordered take out and the phone service and in restaurant service was exceptional!    Once home, my friend and I had the same thoughts about the food... 1. Tom Kha Shrimp soup was too spicy!!  Also, another veggie or two would have been better.. it was a lot of soup with just 9 shrimp and some mushrooms.  And the tails left of the shrimp make it a pain to eat easily.  2. Orange Chicken was not good.. it is very heavily breaded and seemed like it had been fried in old grease...the sauce was very liquidy and had a weird flavor.  3.  Bok Choy Chicken tasted alright, but was also very liquidy... it basically shrunk down due to the heat, so it was a small portion floating in water.  4. Combination Chow Mein was the best thing of the group.. the cabbage is very flavorful and putting together noodle, cabbage, pork kinda created the perfect bite!  5. Egg Rolls have absolutely no flavor at all... like none... nada.  Overall, for the price... I won't be going back.  The 1st place I've tried in the neighborhood was better and I'm guessing I'll run across others that appeal to me more.  And maybe I just tried this place on a bad night, because other reviews seem to love it... I dunno.. :)",

The environment looked all right, you could tell it was kind of old. First things first, the Thai tea was like any other place, lot of ice not enough tea. For the Pad Thai, it felt like whoever was cooking it did not stir it enough to mix the sauce and noodles. Then there was the pineapple fried rice which was too oily for my own taste. I did not try the other items on the menu, they might be better. I will definitely not be coming back even though prices are low, the menu is huge and the service was ok. There are better Thai restaurants in Las Vegas. With Vegas becoming more and more of a food hot spot, I hope the restaurant adapts to the more important concepts of presentation, cleanliness and building a specialty.",

BUT don't be mistaken. The inside is lowly lit and is usually packed with people.  Thai and Chinese food all in one place? What more could you ask for? I was surprised by how friendly and understanding the waiters were.   It was SO windy and freezing cold outside. The woman noticed how frenzy-looking we looked and made us feel as comfortable as possible at our table.  The dishes are less expensive than most Thai places. Be careful when you order the Papaya Salad! It is SUPER spicy. I couldn't eat anything else  for awhile after eating that first. Everything tasted PERFECT. Wish they served more on the plates though.   You don't often get dessert at restaurants without having to pay. Turns out, you get FORTUNE COOKIES. Also, we forgot to sign our receipt, and a man came running out of the restaurant to tell us that. That's how dedicated you know these staff members are.",

I am so disappointed because I was expecting their menu to have basic chinese dishes like crispy house noodles, crispy duck, honey walnut shrimp, and bbq pork. Everything I wanted was not available or was altered from what I was used to. We ended up ordering chicken chow mein, kung fu duck and orange chicken. The chow mein was oily and reminded me of the chow mein you get at the fast food mall food court. The duck was good, wished that it was crispy. The orange chicken was overcooked and somewhat burnt. It contained mostly batter. A problem we had was that we ordered the duck quarter size because it was just my husband and I and they ended up giving us the half size. We thought it was big but we were hungry and no one came to check on us for us to let them know. We never realized it was half until we got the check and we already ate half so we just paid for it without complaining because it took them almost ten minutes to grab our payment. This is definitely a place I will not be coming back fo chinese again.",

    "text": "I live in NLV and was in the area. I figured Chinese food in Chinatown had to be good.  There was a lot of people waiting outside but when we went in to ask how long the wait was we were told a few minutes.  We got lucky because everyone else who came in after us were ignored.  We were seated about 15 minutes later then ignored.  Someone came up with menus after we were seated for about 5 minutes then no one came back.  The people around us who had been seated after us had water and their orders taken.  I finally grabbed a busboy and asked him to get me a waiter.  The waiter finally showed up and we ordered appetizers as well as dinner.  My daughter ordered soup for dinner which even though it was obvious that's all she was getting,  they brought it with the drinks then the appetizers came after about 30 minutes then our dinner almost immediately.  I had the Mongolian beef which was small but the meat was good.  I think the food would have been better if I didn't have such a bad taste in my mouth from the service - or lack thereof.",

I like to order the Thai fried chicken wings that come with a sweet chili sauce. The pad Thai is always a winner. Tom yum goong, chicken chili mints and fresh egg foo young are sure to make you happy. I also love their Thai tea, it's the bomb. Service is good also, they pack up your leftovers for you to. It's a pretty popular place. Try it out and you will not be disappointed.",

Beef fried rice- the beef taste burnt but the fried rice was good.  Last- tofu with basil.  Soggy and was drenched in too much garlic sauce!  (not that great!)  I've been here 3x and the more I come here, the worst the food gets!  It's better to come here for the soup only!",

Little did we know this was the beginning of a pattern.My coworkers and I ordered off of the lunch menu (which for the price looks pretty good, I guess that is what gains them the one mandatory star above). Then the waiting game it took a very long time to get the food. The lunch special comes with egg and flour soup which we received first. It was bland and not very good, had to add soy sauce to it to make it even palatable. About 30 plus minutes later we received our entrees. The food was underwhelming at best. I had the Kung Pao chicken with fried rice, egg roll and Thai fried chicken wing. The chicken wing and egg roll were not too bad, but the rest was sub par and not very good. I believe I could have gotten a better meal at an Asian fast food restaurant. Then it took close to 15 minutes to get our check, followed by another long wait to get it back. It caused one of my coworkers to miss a meeting. Not sure how this place has made it as long as it has.",

We informed the waiter and they told us that is the way they cook general chicken.  It had pineapple and tasted like sweet n sour chicken.  I have never been to a place that puts pineapple in the general chicken!   To top it off, there was a group of 15 folks standing around our table just waiting for tables to be cleared to be sitted. (Half of their crowd were sitted and the other half waiting).   It was dis-organized and other table was getting upset as well.  One table found a roach crawling on the table and yelled it out.  We were very irratated and asked for a check.  My husband didn't get to eat at all and nor did the waiter got us any refill on our drink.  Food was not authentic at all (yes I'm Asian), poor service, and very dis organized! I travel around the world just to try different Thai restaurant and this is not one to ever recommend or return too.  Best authentic this food in Vegas is by far Lotus of Siem!!",

The waitress told us (again by showing the notepad) that we hadn't ordered the meal that was forgotten. Strange, we all recalled the order details. Regardless, another member of the staff magically got the order to appear. Sodas were never refilled, the place was a huge disappointment. We took our kids there to practice their mandarin and couldn't find anyone that spoke the language. Why are you in chinatown??? Chinese buffets in malls would be better options.

The rice, soup, and pad thai were delicious and came in very generous portions. The BBQ pork soup was available at any spiciness you desired, on a scale of 1-10. We love spicy food, but we were nervous to go too spicy, so we ordered a 4. Well.... a 4 is HOT, very very HOT... but delicious! the flavor was great, but I would definitely recommend not going too high with the spiciness!",

As I'm pulling up to the restaurant I get another call asking if I was on my way. I tell them I'm pulling in. I walk in, tell a server I was here for a pickup order, he said he was going to go get it, 10 minutes later, nothing. So I take a play out of their book and call them, tell them I'm standing up front, she says \"oh, okay, we'll bring it out to you\". 15 minutes later, nothing, so here I am 25 minutes later standing here writing a review and still no order. If you're going to be so adamant about me picking up my order, maybe you should have the order completed in the first place. Overpriced, mediocre food with terrible service.",

I love their spicy shrimp salad, pad Woon sen, and Tom yum soup. Everything is so flavorful and amazing. I'm also in love with their Thai iced coffee. I can't find another place that makes their drinks as good as this place. I wish this place was in oc so I could go every week. However since it's in vegas, I always make a stop here when I go to vegas. Love this place and I would highly recommend it to everyone. Nice servers and workers as well.",

The pad see ew was so good, I really liked how some of the noodles had a crunch to them because they were stir fried and not over cooked. And the curry was pretty amazing. Don't order if you can't take spice because the order comes precooked with spices so I ordered little to no spice and it had a kick to it but I didn't mind, still tasted awesome.   At first the dishes looked so plain and unattractive, not like other Thai restaurants but once I tried the food I was blown away!   I guess that's how you know a restaurants Chefs and ingredients are amazing, when the dishes look so plain but have amazing flavor! Not drenched in typical sauce packets like Thai house or lucky Thai. I'm really happy I tried this place out.",

The restaurant is on the corner of Spring Mountain and Valley View Blvd. You'll find parking in the strip plaza. It does get busy though!  It's very nicely decorated inside. There is plenty of seating, the booths are pretty big but if you need something for a larger party then there are plenty of tables to go around.  Restrooms are typically ok.  There is a full bar but I have never really seen too many people sit there.  FREE Wi-Fi.  Customer service is usually fast and efficient. The waiters are very friendly and knowledgable when you ask a question about the menu or a dish.  The food is to die for! Always fresh and hot when it comes out. My favorite dish is the Mongolian Beef/ Chicken. It's topped with some fried noodles that totally make the dish! My husband likes many of the dishes so he does not have one is particular. We usually get an order of potstickers but they are deep fried and are too crunchy for my tastes.  Give this place a try! You will get hooked!",

Between the two of us, we ordered the chicken fried rice, chicken pad siew-ew, and the pad woon sen. I would have added pictures to this review, but I was so hungry when the food got here I completely forgot to take pictures, ha!  The process to order online was seamless and, for an Asian food restuarant, in my opinion, ahead of the game in comparison to other restaurants (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.kungfuplaza.com%2F&s=296015ce5f3b438be1025cfefb0a662f5c6b3ed81b62201cdf1dff47c198c64e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">kungfuplaza.com</a>). Their website is very clean and well laid out. It lists out all of their food items, descriptions of the foods, as well as pictures. When you go to check-out you fill in all of your information and it offers places to add comments should there be any special requests, option to add tip, as well as an option to pick when you want your food delivered (in case you were ordering for later and would not have time to put an order in or for future deliveries).  I was sent an emailed receipt detailing all of the tidbits I added on to my order including my instructions on where to drop off and which number to call upon arrival and a breakdown of the receipt. I don't usually get impressed by a site or receipt so it says a lot when I say I was very impressed by this.  Upon arrival, the driver called to let me know he was five minutes away and where he would be. The food was fresh and was still piping hot when I took it back to the office. It was very flavorful and they gave us so much for the price!  Thanks, Kung Fu! We will be ordering again.",

We decided to try this place since Pho Kim Long was packed, when we sat down I looked over the Yelp reviews and my stomach started to sink...  to the point where I was thinking of walking out, but I decided to stick it out. The calamari came out first, suffice to say DO NOT ORDER that, it was horrible. It was all flour and the squid was rubbery. But thankfully all the other dishes I ordered was ok. My husband loved his pork and garlic dish, the pad see ew beef was good, the Mongolian beef was good too. For me it wasn't fantastically amazing, but for someone who was super hungry, it was good enough. Will I want or crave to go back? Probably not but my husband really loved his pork and garlic so if he begs, I probably will. As for service, it was ok, ambience soso at least my seats weren't torn. Cleanliness ok as well. My overall rating for this place is average, and my advice is just try to avoid the horrible dishes and zone in on the ones that are good.",

    "text": "I hate being lied to.  The food there is good; not any better than any Thai place in town and a little worse than Komol and Lotus of Siam, but OK.  The service is sub-standard, but not glaringly so.  The wait times for food is unusually long; perhaps because they are trying to get you to drink more.  But they lie.  First off, never ever ever order order for pick up.  They will wait for you to show up to begin making it so you do not cheat them by a no show.  They will lie to you when you get there and say it \"almost done\" and immediately run you card, and then you will wait between 30-40 minutes for the food.  If you call and get them to promise they will make it and it will be waiting hot, they will still lie, and say they will.  And they will not.  This happened to me 4 times before I gave up on them, as they are the closest Thai place to my home and therefor a logical choice if we want a quick dinner.  Then we went to do deliveries at our home from them, as they we the only Thai place that we could find that delivered.  A guy came for several times, we paid a good tip and there were no issues, and then, out of the blue, the person answered the phone told us they they could not deliver to our area, it was \"too far.\"  When we pointed out to them that they had delivered several times before, the person on the phone informed us categorically that they had never delivered to that area and accused us of lying.  We shrugged, figured we had someone new or crazy or what not, ordered someplace else and moved on.  A few weeks later we tried to order again, a different person answered the phone and again categorically informed us they had never delivered to the area where our home was located.  A change in policy because we were too far away . . . fine.  But it doesn't sit with me well how easy and enthusiastically they lie.  Their food ain't bad, but it is not worth putting up with their service or their lying.",

Well at least, that's according to my friends and I. :)  Went here late Friday night after having gone to First Friday at the Arts District. Been craving for some Chinese food so we originally planned of going to this Golden Flower in Henderson, but unfortunately it's closed when we arrived there. Since that was already past 930p, most of the Chinese buffets we know were already closed. So we had this genius idea of going back downtown until we brought ourselves to Chinatown. That was quite a drive I'll say so talk about starving. Lol  We basically just acted on impulse and eat wherever our eyes set on first. And this was it! We absolutely liked the food, the restau's ambiance, and its all-cool-and-smiling staff. :)  If you're around the area, you must try this dining place out sometime!",

I ordered the orange chicken lunch special with fried rice for $6.75 And an appetizer sampler. First of all the \"chicken\" was heavily battered. upon further investigation ( me taking apart the breading ) i realized that the chicken is not breaded in house. Its the cheapest mechanically separated frozen garbage ive ever seen. This meal was worse then the chinese food station at the palace station buffet. With an overly sweet sauce dedicated to hiding the \"flavor\" of this so called version of meat. I was truly disappointed. I envision an owner that cares more about food cost percentages then he does about the quality of the food. Batter your own chicken! Chicken is cheap. Very disappointed!

The fried chicken wings have almost never failed me, except maybe once or twice in 5 years.  I love how crunchy it is on the outside and how moist it is in the inside.  They don't seem to put much spices or salt on it, and it's just delicious the way it is.  The pork salad is also really good, and it's kind of sour, sweet, and savory.  The mint chicken is also to die for.  There's just something about it that is better than any other versions of mint/basil chicken I have ever had at Thai restaurants.  Give me some of that with the jasmine rice and I'm good to go.  Their service is not always the best, but servers are always polite and fast.  I've never had a problem with a long wait.  Of all Thai places I've tried, this is still my favorite!  Maybe because I LOVE me some good crunchy and crispy chicken wings and this is as good as it gets!",

He ordered the whole fried catfish and you should of seen when the waiter sat it down in front of him. He almost jumped out his skin.   But kids aside, ordering whole catfish when they don't know what to expect and aren't listening to the adults tell them it is a whole catfish the food is always great and the service matches it. Oh, the catfish was fantastic with the chili sauce being delightfully unique.",

We started with the Seafood Tom Yum Soup. The light tangy soup was not a hit with everyone. The broth was filled with mussels, shrimp, squid, fish filet, and mushrooms. From that point on, the food came out in rapid secession. The Combination Pad Thai was lacking flavor compared to the Pork Pad See Ew. Now that we have eaten every animal on land and sea we got an order of Sauteed Chinese Broccoli.   The service is quick and attentive, Our water glasses were always full and dirty dishes were taken away quickly. The food is a safe bet. Another reason why we are always back here.",

He was indifferent and kind of ignored is the rest of the night.  Now the food.. Ugh. I ordered egg flower soup .. It was so thick I couldn't stomach it. Mongolian beef was okay .. Very small portion and I don't eat that much. Egg foo young looked gross on the plate. It tasted okay.. I mean it's only eggs. It just wasn't that great like I thought it would be.",

I talked to the server, who then said \"oh, you should have ordered a non-spicy one\". And refused to take it back.  So they expect the customers to do their job???? What the heck are the customers supposed to know that they offer a non-spicy, in addition to \"mild\", and \"spicy\"??? The POOREST customer service we have ever seen!  Eat here at your own risk!",

Service has always been just alright, but you would think since I come I'm in quite a bit, that'd would have at least changed. Nope. I also want to say that by far, they have my FAVORITE Tom Yum and Yum Woonsen. Order it every time. No other restaurant makes it as good as they do. But to the docking of stars. My husband no longer wants to dine here after basically being ignored one visit. We were barely acknowledged, just enough so that we finally got to place an order after being seated for 20 minutes ( again, we know what we want and just wasn't approached prior to this.) When we got our food, I was willing to dismiss the lack of service in the beginning, because the food is just so dang good and  I had an ok history with them. Buuuut, we weren't even on their radar during the meal. Our waters were not once refilled (or offered), no one asked how our meal was, or even if we would like anything else. Nothing. My husband was furious. We talked to them about how we felt neglected from the awful service, and their decision? Give us 10% off. Um. Ok. We are very reasonable people and are pretty polite, even if it comes down to complaining. Had we had a large bill, 10% would have been sufficient. But for two meals, they basically covered tax. Poor customer service recovery, in my opinion, especially for someone that has frequented there often.  Really disappointed.",

I just moved to Las Vegas and I'm not the most familiar with where things are so I ordered delivery from the first place that came up on Google, Kung fu. After ordering my food with the delivery fee and automatic 15% tip to the driver, a woman called to confirm my order. She asked what my cross streets were and realized I'm on the other side of town but she said it was okay. An hour later, our food arrived and I was greeted by my deliver driver. He was an older Asian man who proceeded to complain and moan about my delivery to no end. I pretty much closed the door on him. I felt like I was being scolded by my father or something. He complained about things I couldn't control like the fact that my complex is too dark for him to see the building and he complained about how he had to drive SO far (not even 20 minutes). When I apologized for the inconvenience I had caused him he just repeated how far I made him drive. I will never give this restaurant my business again because of that driver. The food also was not worth the price or the frustration.",

It's a nice place to go if you want a lot of food for a low price and aren't too concerned about service.  *You can also view the comment that was left on this review to get a further understanding of the people that work there:  -Only I would know how many times I've gone to this restaurant, so for this person to say, \" I'm sure you've been here more, you just forgot a few other times we were together,\" is just a little absurd. And after asking my boyfriend, it turns out I've only gone here TWO times.     -\"You'll probably have to get use to having great tasting Thai and Chinese food.\" Excuse me? I'll probably have to GET USE TO having this stuff? As if I haven't gone to other Thai and Chinese restaurants before. I didn't even mention the fact that it was Chinese and Thai in my review, so i don't see what that has to do with anything.   -\"see for yourself. The Tourism Authority of Thailand delegates to the DEMA show dined with us three out of the four days they were here in Vegas.\" Umm, is that suppose to mean something to me? Showing me some link isn't going to change my taste buds.   I gave this restaurant two stars for a reason. The food is mediocre and the service is lacking, but that doesn't mean I hated it.  I've left far worse reviews at other places.",

Knowing that service in Chinatown sucks we order a beer and chatted. Pot stickers came out steamed. Waited another 10 minutes for the 1 server on the floor to notice me waiving my hand. Nightmare. Comes over and started yelling that we ordered steamed. Never order steamed potstickers in my life but then again what server yells at you that you did. And no offense but with their language barrier how am I the one that is mistaken??? Went to walk out and he said \"beer is $8.25\" which we didn't even finish. So many good options have opened in Chinatown over the last 20 plus years. Save your money. These people suck and I will never step foot in their restaurant again. Yelp should let you give 0 stars.",

I've lived in Vegas for 13 years, and I just recently discovered this restaurant thanks to my cousin who visits annually from California (and apparently has been coming to Kung Fu Thai every year for the last 5 years... TFTI).   Trying to find parking sucks since it's located in the same strip mall as Pho Kim Long, Lee's Sandwiches, etc. However, since Kung Fu Thai is located more towards the side of the building, on the corner of Spring Mountain & Valley View, I was later advised that there's more parking in an alley-ish on Valley View (*Will be more concise & update next time I go).   I got there around 3 on a weekday, and it was PACKED, and it grew even busier the closer it got to dinner time. So I can only imagine how crazy busy it can get actually during dinner and/or on the weekends. I would advise to go early.   The food is amazing & it's served \"family-style.\" Unless you're like me & my family and eat A LOT in one sitting, then you could probably keep one entree order all to yourself (or three).",

Their Chinese food is pretty good too, although it may not be as authentic as a normal Chinese place, they serve some good Chinese food here as well.  I've been coming to this place with my family for a number of years now. I always love coming to this place for the food and I enjoy chatting with some of the waiters. It's friendly for family, and large parties if necessary.   My favorite things to eat from here are the pad thai, pad se ew, and general Tso's chicken. Kung Fu gets pad thai correctly and cooks their pad se ew well and both have flavor. Their general Tso's chicken is sweet and has a slightly spicy flavor to it and this is best eaten at the restaurant so it is still crispy when you eat it! I have ordered their curry, vegetable dishes, tom kha soup, and I enjoy them all!  Don't be scared to try this place, it will not disappoint. A lot of people enjoy coming here and you will soon find out why.",

Heard good things about it and fellow colleagues always go, so today me and Ellen F. decide to check it out.   Located on the southwest corner in the strip mall on Valley View and Spring Mountain, can't miss it with a name like Kung Fu on the outside. We were seated right away, place wasn't too busy so a waiter took our drink orders promptly.   The place looks old school but don't care about that, has a lot of Thai decor with elephants and pictures of the motherland. I get the feeling this place is geared more toward Thai than Chinese but who knows. If you want pad Thai don't fall for the trap and order it from the menu as they offer it as a lunch special for $6.95 Mon-Fri 11am-3pm. I fell for this and ordered the combo pad Thai with an order of rice, it was huge!! Enough for two people.   I doubt the lunch portion is as big but still much cheaper and comes with soup or an egg roll. The pad Thai was very good, along with the rice, the quantity was more than enough and the bill was reasonable. We will be returning during lunch hours to take full advantage of the specials. If your looking for a cheap meal in Chinatown with no frills it's worth a stop.",

    "text": "After hearing lots of chatter, I finally made it to Kung Fu to give it a try.  I discovered a large menu and quite the assortment of Chinese and Thai dishes.  Located at Valley View and Spring Mountain, you're close to one end of Chinatown.  For those who haven't ventured down Spring Mountain Road to see and sample the amazing assortment of Asian shops and restaurants, this may be a good place to start?  Three of us went in for lunch.  The restaurant was dark inside, almost under-lit, giving me the impression that they don't want folks looking around too closely.  It wasn't obvious, but it made me wonder if the place was dirty or not in good repair.  I couldn't tell.  Even thought there were only a few other customers at tables, it took a minute for someone from the staff to realize we had walked in the door.  Even so, the greeting was friendly and once noticed, we were quickly seated, drinks were put on the table and our orders were quickly placed.  I ordered Beef and Green Beans off the Thai menu.  The food came out hot and tasted fine, and by fine I mean it was okay.  My honest impression was that the menu is large enough that many of what could be unique flavors for specific dishes may be blending together or lost for the cooks.  There were no unique Thai flavors in the dish I ordered and actually had to go back and look to be sure I ordered a Thai dish and not a Chinese dish.  Drinks were refilled regularly, there were no issues paying, and we were on our way after lunch without any unnecessary delay.  Was it great?  No.  Was it bad?  No.  Would I go back?  Sure, if someone I was with wanted to eat there.  If you're in this part of town, I think this is probably a safe place to grab a sit-down meal that's going to be consistently good, but with all the other options very near by, I'm sure you can find restaurants with a more tailored approach to the specific dish or dishes you're after.  One final note:  the shopping center where Kung Fu is located can be busy.  It's not a problem, but depending on your luck with parking spots, be prepared to park down the storefront quite a ways if you're there at lunchtime.",

This is a family place and they have been in business since the 70s.  Their take out business is booming and famous with locals.  Ask valets at the area hotels if they know kung fu thai food...  Highly recommend the pad thai and roasted duck.    The menu is huge, dozens of items and large vegetarian menu.    Authentic and delicious thai food at a reaonable price.  Its a bigger operation than ''mom and pop'' , you can bring larger parties there with no fear of overwhelming the kitchen.    Highly recommend.",

When the tour buses from Asia stop in it can get crowded, and it's even busy during the week. The floor is large, and can accommodate large parties. If you're in Vegas and haven't been here you need to stop in. And if you're staying in the strip it's just across the freeway from the strip in the China Town corridor.",

First they took like 20 minutes to come to our table to take our order, and that's after asking to other servers to see if we are going to get served.  They brought one of the items way before the other items arrives in which it got really cold.  Then since our server never came to check on us I went ahead and got up to ask an available buser for a spice rack and she completely snapped at me and put her hand up like as if she was shutting me up!  Unbelievable!! So once we finished our unpleasant meal I spoke to the manager about her rude buser and all she said was she will talk to her, the manager didn't care to accommodate for the bad experience and all she was worried about was if the food was good, not caring about the service or experience we received.  So with that said I will NOT step into this establishment again or even recommend anyone I know. This place is NOT WORTH YOUR TIME & MONEY!!",

After waiting 45 minutes for delivery it still hadn't arrived and after 30 more minutes and numerous calls to the restaurant and driver our food finally arrived. The food was phenomenal but it would've been nice to be compensated for the wait time or at least them called us to say sorry driver was lost instead of us having to find out what the hold up was. If our food was delivered timely we would've given 5 stars. It was that good!",

First this is the first Thai restaurant that don't serve yellow curry. We heard from the other group said the same thing as well. All the food was below average in my opinion. The panang curry doesn't have any curry favor, it was made by the peanut butter. The combination fried rice has too much moisture in it. Garlic chicken little too favorful, but if eat it with rice. It will be fine. Pai Thai was kinda disappointing. It lacks favor and it doesn't taste like Pai Thai. It tastes like Chow mein instead. Let's talk about good points for this restaurant. The service from the staff is good and the food come out quickly. The price and food portion is average. Overall, due to the below average of food I probably won't come back.",

It didn't even seem that it was fried because of all the water or stock they added.  It was almost to the verge of porridge territory.  I was surprised at the prices too, about $10 a dish, for the quality and quantity they serve (meaning small portion).  Their menu is extensive. They specialize in Thai, and Chinese food.  I would rather go to the strip and pay and eat Americanized Chinese food.",

Thai Food: 3/5 It was okay not much to rage about. I ordered a yellow chicken curry. Usually curry comes in a semi-thick sauce but they was plan soupy. The rice we ordered for our curry ended up being over cooked and dry. Even though the curry sauce wasn't as thick as I'm used to it was still delicious. Not as spicy as I wanted it but It was an \"Americanized 10\" not Thai 10 on the scale of spicy.   Chinese Food: 2/5  I'm not much of a Chinese food eater because I've noticed a lot of Chinese dishes are super oil and greasy. BUT We ordered some kind of stir fried Mongolian Beef dish. It was definitely a Chinese dish because the sauce was oily you could see the oil bubbles.   Service: 3/5 The service was good even during busy hours. The place was a bit of mess though. There was rice and pea's ever where, but I just brushed it off because there were children running around. This place seems family ordinate but it was also loud.",

Every time we order from the male, the orders are always correct. When we order from the female, every time, the order is incorrect. Everytime.

So, naturally, we had to try each one. And, they were all pretty good. But this place was better. The Tom Yum Gai (chicken lemongrass soup) was the best by far. If you get the two-person portion, it's enough for three or four. After the soup, my wife is done, but I get a plate of Thai Bok Choy (Chinese cabbage cooked Thai style). Very fresh and the flavor really shines. The fact that they combine Thai and Chinese foods on their menu, is really smart. I've gone there for lunch, early dinner, late dinner, Christmas Eve, and Christmas day, and they're always almost full, but I've never had to wait for a table. It's a pretty sizable place. I don't drink, but you can't miss the huge bar on the right side of the dining room. Service is good, prices are reasonable. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it!",

We ate there three of the four nights of our stay.   I enjoyed the sweet and sour Thai style chicken so much I ordered it 3 times. We also shared beef with mixed vegetables and Pad Thai chicken.  We'll most certainly return on our next trip. It will be hard to choose an alternative restaurant as this place has set the bar so high.
