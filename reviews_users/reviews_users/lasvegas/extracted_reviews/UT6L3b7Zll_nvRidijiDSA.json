Asked a couple of food questions w/ the Asian bartender and the girl bartender and they both gave me short unwelcoming answers.   I had already ordered a coke but decided to leave since I felt like they were both too busy even though I was the only one at the bar. I told the girl bartender I was leaving and if I owe her anything for the coke and she told me $4.82.   Really!? I didn't even take a sip out of it. It's not about the money! My intentions were to leave a $2 tip fully expecting her to say \"you don't owe anything.\"   I know everyone has bad days and I normally don't write bad reviews but this was ridiculous. I gave her $5 and walked away.  Horrible service! Go see Tony at Lemongrass instead! I'm a local and you definitely won't catch me here again.",

BF had the farmstead pizza while everyone else at our table order other pizzas to share. i did have a couple pieces of my bf's pizza only because i LOVE eggs and just seeing the yummy yolks running down the sides of the slices made my mouth water.   the food was good, not completely in awe of it, especially with the price. our bill just for my bf and i came up to abut $60 (including tip) and one alcoholic beverage. everyone says \"its vegas, everything is expensive\" but honestly.....for pizza and salad? but at least we had a good time and good experience. would i go back again? probably not.",

The gotham and the spicy one (I cant remember its name) are very delicious. They obviously use high quality ingredients, and have consistently made a delicious pizza every single time. The crust though...I never knew that crust on a pizza would make me say \"wow, this crust is so good\" at least 3 times per pizza. It's perfectly cooked/burnt to perfection sourdough.  The drinks are good, and the service is also very good. One thing to consider before you sit down though is that they only serve certain things at the bar, and certain things at the table. So that can be a little confusing, and really the only thing I can say is maybe not great. Other than that minor detail its all good.  The pizza is really that good.",

Then came the pizza, margarita, if a place can't get a regular cheese pizza right then why order anything else. Well they couldn't get it right. Still very doughy under the cheese (raw dough). Cheese at best was just standard, nothing special. If you're in the mood for Pizza, I've had great pizza at the Sugar Factory and the Cosmo. Skip this place. Expensive. Then we had the chocolate brownie mouse thingy,  it was good but they tried to get too fancy with the mason jar so it tips over, it's not a bad dessert but it's interesting flavors with the whipped cream and basil.

Featuring a slice counter plus a handful of primi, pasta, salads, and desserts alongside 16\" pizzas cooked in a 550 degree oven the \"style\" of McClain's signature pies falls somewhere between traditional New York slices and a Roman lightly-leavened 'crunchy' crust but with ingredient quality meeting the standards set by Sage the results were largely impressive save for the excessive use of oil and salt marring the Truffle and an unannounced red sauce lending a peculiar barbecue note to the North Beach.  Faring better, a simple Margherita assuredly displayed the restaurant's sourcing with tangy tomatoes and fresh basil while the Blanca shined largely to a thick dollop of house-made ricotta on each slice.  Moving past pizza, a sampling of the cannelloni proved to be my favorite savory of the day, albeit slightly overpriced at $18 for two pasta tubes stuffed with tender pork and topped with creamy Bechamel plus meager truffle shavings while a trio of arancini presented a unique riff on a classic by substituting house cured pepperoni for traditional sausage and pairing it with thick, aromatic aioli.  Never happy to leave a restaurant without dessert, a final pairing arrived at the table in the form of a small apple pie with accoutrements both sweet and savory alongside fried brioche cubes paired with sour cranberry sauce; both sweets trumping any of the savories and a saving grace at the end of a meal that fell short of high expectations.",

We bought tickets to see the Cirque Du Soleil Zarkana show at Aria. After the show we stumbled upon Five50 nestled away in a back corner on the lobby level of the hotel. The restaurant received some good reviews on Yelp, so we decided to check it out. Now Five50 is our go-to pizza spot!  It is labeled as a \"casual pizza experience,\" but the ambience of the hotel and restaurant add to its charm. As you walk into the restaurant, there is a long counter that acts as an extension of the kitchen. Here you can place to go orders for pizza and other items. There are also tables just outside the restaurant where you can stand and eat your pizza for a quicker dining experience. The restaurant has definite character and personality. A long curved wall of wooden blocks stacked on top of each other separate the diners from the rest of the hotel/casino. Behind the restaurant is the sports book room where sports junkies can get their fix and gamble on events. There is a circular bar located in the center of the restaurant, along with tv's for your viewing pleasure. The service was a little hit and miss, but overall decent.   The menu offers eclectic pizza choices such as the truffle pizza (I would recommend this!), soups/salads, and pastas. The pizza is prepared fresh and cooked perfectly. Five50 offers a unique casual pizza experience with good food, and all the benefits of a Vegas establishment.",

We were really satisfied by the unique combinations available here and the high quality of the ingredients that they used on the pizzas. The server was very attentive and friendly and there was actually a small selection of craft beer of tap (a rarity in Vegas, where cheap beer and yards of icy drinks are the norm). Sadly, we discovered this at ghe",

My wife and I ordered the Forager to take back to our room at the Vdara.  The pizza took about half an hour to cook.  If you want just a slice, they sell massive slices for $5.50.  That's probably what we will do next time.  Ordering a whole pizza is just too much for two people.  We were both starving and still had about a quarter of the pie left when we were stuffed.  Expect to pay 25-35 dollars for a to-go pizza.  Again, it's great pizza, but don't expect it to be cheap.",

Unfortunately, quality is usually on par with your local mall food court.   Five50 is different. Not only is it easy to find within the casino (straight through the lobby on the left from the parking garage), but it's priced cheap ($5.50 a slice including specialty styles) but doesn't taste like it. On any given day, there are four featured pies available by the slice: the Gotham (meat heavy), Forager (cheese and mushrooms), a cheese-only version, and a featured daily special.   if by the slice isn't for you, they also offer an extended menu of whole pies, along with salads, sandwiches, shakes, and small plates. But their pizza is obviously the highlight.",

    "text": "After a late night in Vegas, this place was heaven sent! With no where being open that late and a bunch of people lining up to eat here, it seemed like a great choice. The pizza reminded me of a lot of the pizzas I've had in New York. I ordered the Forager pizza: white sauce, spinach, mushrooms and whipped ricotta. With a finishing touch of red pepper flakes, it was amazing! One slice was definitely enough for me, but it was so good I could've ate a second slice! If I'm ever craving a great pizza in Vegas, I know where to go now!",

    "text": "Five50 pizza was a convenient place to go.  So I made three dinner visits. Twice I had a dish that was half order spaghetti and half order meatball; which I learned about from one of the nice waitresses behind the bar.  Strangely, the menu only has spaghetti or meatballs but not both.  The sauce was perfectly spiced and meatballs delicious.  Here's where the points get docked: I also ordered slices of pizza. And on two visits, the pepperonis were hard like poker chips.  I would assume that the slices had been prescribed strong light therapy under a heat lamp and then was reheated for my order.  And in contrast to the pokeronis, the dough was soggy towards the wedge.  This was supposed to be a pizza restaurant, not 7-11.",

When looking at the Aria- this is a great place to go. The pizza is top quality (not the frozen tasting option in the horrible Aria buffet). The value is competitive and the service of a quick ready to eat meal is great. Thanks Five50 Pizza Bar for being a fantastic option at the Aria.",

So thin that my pizza was pointing downwards as I tried to eat it.  I had to use a fork to pick up my food.  Overall the pizza is very greasy and not as tasty as Papa John's for triple the price.  Next time, I will just use my comps on that new burger joint next to the poker room.",

The pizza is not quite New York style - it's a little thicker, but it's got the right char and bubbles.  The puffy, chewy garlic knots are a good starter, too.  Service was very good as well.  If you're looking for real New York pizza and cheap slices, take the walk to Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan, but Five50 is a good choice if you want a little more than just pizza.",

    "text": "I had free $200 food and beverage credits linked to my room, and we had to use them at Aria, so we decided on Five50.  We had a party of ten, and were told to wait fifteen minutes.  When she finally announced that the table was ready, we were led to a round table in a secluded area, and were seated.  The reason why we waited fifteen minutes is beyond my knowledge, for the restaurant probably had less than ten diners excluding us.    Upon much contemplation, we agreed upon ordered four pizzas, and two pasta dishes to share.  The pizzas were the margherita, gotham, truffle, and north beach.  The pastas included the ricotta cavatelli, and a secret dish, not on the menu, which featured freshly arrived clams, and linguine.  The pizzas and pastas came out fairly quickly.  The pizzas were all very tasty, my favorite being the truffle and margherita.  One does not get to eat real truffles every day, so they were a welcome treat.  The margherita had a sweet and savory sauce, and the cheese was equally appealing to the palate.  However, the pastas, lacked anything they would deem them of a worthy restaurant quality dish.  The cavatelli was overpowered with a sour and salty lime taste that went into every spoonful.  On the other hand, the secret pasta lacked any flavor at all.  It was bland, and very oily.    -1 star for the disappointing pastas.   +4 stars for the excellent service and great tasting pizzas.",

I rarely go into CC due to it being so difficult getting in to, but meeting my friend was totally worth it. I came in on a Friday, during a very stormy monsoon out on the Strip, As soon as I showed up Valet had to be closed due to the lightning and heavy rain. then I went into the self parking. The walk is a little long getting in there, but the food made-up for the long walk.  Now to the food, I was impressed with this upscale pizza place! It had a fun vibe, and the decor was very nice. I tried the polenta with egg! YUMZ!  For a salad we shared a beet, peach, frisee and hazelnut composition. Beets and peaches! Can't go wrong!  My favorite was a bread with cheese and garlic sauce! I ate like 3 pieces! Carb overload right?   The pizza was amazing, I believe it was the Gotham. Pepporoni and sausage. I absolutely loved the crust. It was chewy and crunchy at the same time, and you can just tell there's something different in the water they use. It couldn't have been Vegas water. We don't have crust that good with the water from the faucets in town. Idk what the secret is, but I loved it.  For dessert we shared an ice cream sandwich and chocolate custard w lavender. The custard was yumz! Got thicker the further down you went:)  Not too impressed w the sandwich.   The place is friendly and casual, still with a nice ambience. It was child friendly as well.  It was nice to see Chef Shawn putting his finishing touches on the pizzas and other dishes.",

Perfectly crunchy, filled with delicious grease, dripping with cheese, served just hot enough to smell and taste delicious, not far too hot like most places, or cold like delivery or takeout.  Guys, please open a place here in San Diego.  There are lots of unoccupied bars and restaurants in Gaslamp.",

You need to cater to your patrons and be flexible. I mean, how hard is it to make a salad?!?!",

    "text": "This is a sitdown pizza restaurant located inside Aria. I gave this place four stars because it has what you need from a good pizza place. If you're looking for just slices they have some to go however they do not offer slices of pizza when you sit down in the restaurant.   The pizzas are hefty and good sized, enough for 2 people (maybe even more depending how much you eat). We ordered the Catania which is a pizza with white sauce, Italian sausage and tomato. I personally really liked this pizza. It came out nice and hot with a slightly charred thin crust and an abundance of cheese. The white sauce made the top of the pizza have a creamier texture, so you get the crispy texture from the crust along with the softness of the cream all in the same bite. The markings of a good pizza.   We are also ordered the chicken wings for an appetizer. The wings were dressed with flavor. Had a little kick to it but it was sort of a sweet and spicy type of dressing. Came out with a little bit of ranch for dipping. I could have done without the wings. Anyway, overall four stars all around.",

    "text": "The most delightful New York style pizza in Las Vegas. Highly recommended pizza from someone that could live off of pizza 3 meals a day / 365 days a year. Great for a late night dinner after a show, a quick snack, or to just hang out with friends in a trendy place. They have a full bar and menu selection to please even the pickiest of eaters.   For the fellas that line pizza as much as I do, I'd suggest ordering an extra appetizer or two - this way you have leftovers to put in your fridge (most rooms in the Aria or Vdara have a fridge in the room) / snack for later on.   This pizza joint is located with in the Aria resort, just off of the casino floor. There is a very warm feeling (ambiance) when you walk in.  You have two ways of ordering. Either through their To Go window or via a Sit Down dining experience. I've done both.   Servers are fun and really seem to enjoy being there. No pressure to order anything fancy, the way you sometimes feel at Vegas restaurants.   This pizza is simply amazing.   A number of the other reviews are critical of this place because of the price. If you are used to paying $10 for a Dominos pizza, then you will be surprised. But if you enjoy treating yourself / your family to something special, this is the place for you.",

One day, I noticed a chalkboard, 'HUMBOLT Fog goat cheese' that spoke my language, I asked the bartender what I could get w/ that & he said I could pick 3 or 6 different meats & cheeses, like a charcuterie board.  Great!    Now, I'm totally happy w/ Five50.  If it wasn't for this, I'd give only 3 stars.  The wonderfully seasoned chewy bread, pitted olives, pear or apple, mustard, love the spicy Chorizo, usually have Dominique pick another meat side to try w/ the goat cheese.  Paired w/ the wine it is fantastic, quick & I'm on my way in about 5.50 lol.  Cheers!",

I stayed at Vdara again and walked over here before Jewel ( another story for another time) and decided to eat!  Be warned. The pizza is somewhat expensive but it's Vegas. If cheap is an issue, and I love cheap food, go to Norms. Ordered the basic Margherita and calamari. The calamari had a good flavor and was fresh but the breading was a bit soggy. I prefer for it to be more crispy but it was good.   The pizza is the real stunner. 26$ for Margherita seems expensive to most but it is easily one of the best pizzas I've had in life. Usual Margherita with thin crust, buffalo mozzarella and basil. The cheese is amazing quality and there's overall shredded mozzarella on the pizza so it's not just sauce with tiny pillows of mozzarella. They also add the basil post bake so it doesn't get crispy and tasteless. Not much to disliked here! Service wasn't bad but the place was busy at 8pm on a Friday night. They can charge to your room at Aria or Vdara. Great pizza on the strip and an easy walk from where I was staying. Tasty!",

Went for the Gotham, which is sorta like a meat-lovers with a spicy kick, and the North Beach, which is a pizza with clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano.    Gotham's tasty, just as expected, especially if you're a fan of pepperoni and/or salami.  The North Beach was sort of a gamble since we wanted to try something different and man, we lost.  We expected a pizza with clams sprinkled onto the pizza, but what you get is actually one clam in the shell per slice.  Yup, 8 slices, 8 clams.  After you eat the one clam, it's just a cheese pizza essentially.  The smoked mozz and sweet onions was very tasty though.  We also ordered an order of wings after the girl on the phone said it was very delicious, and she was right, it was very tasty!  Not really a buffalo sauce, but it does have a slight kick and sweetness to it.  We were quite glad we were convinced to order it haha.  Now, for the price, each pizza is close to $30 (why we also thought there would be more clams), and for some reason the wings aren't on the online menu when we ordered so we didn't know, but our bill was $90+ with two cokes after taxes.  We knew Vegas was expensive but man, $90+ for pizza and wings was sorta crazy.    They sell by the slice as well, but I think I'd rather walk a little more to Cosmo and eat Secret Pizza next time.",

I observed all the other servers pouring the water for their tables. Eventually our pizza came out which was delicious. The guy who brought it was very friendly and asked if we needed anything else. Our server didn't didn't check on us until we were basically done eating. The pizza was delicious and the staff was awesome except for our server. Hopefully Zorica can take the time to learn from her coworkers good examples and become a better server.",

Pretty good, nice crispy crust. Pizza crust is pretty thin. There is a sports arena down the hall from this place that you can take your pizza with you. Also tried their meatball sandwhich which had a very juicy moist meatball topped with marinated italian veggie toppings for nice crunch and texture. Nice easy cheap dining option inside the Aria.

A lot of the casinos had really small sports bars so I was glad to have somewhere more casual to come have a drink.  The first time we stopped in was for happy hour we saw online.  Unfortunately there wasn't a happy hour.  We decided to have a couple of beers and the warm ricotta.  The ricotta was amazing, but they didn't provide enough bread and didn't offer us anymore.  Drinks were slow and the food was slow to come out.  Another day we stopped by to grab a few slices of pizza.  The service at the counter was faster and the pizza was better then average.    The last time we came we wanted to try the adult milkshakes.  Service was awful at the bar.  We got the Elvis with Rum.  It was actually pretty disappointing, it tasted like a standard milkshake.    I will be back for pizza on the go, but won't sit at the bar again as the service was not good either time.",

I was in the \"to go\" line. She rolled her eyes gave us a pizza box and let us box our own pizza instead of boxing it up for us.

We chose to go to Five50 because of positive reviews on OpenTable, good pictures of the pizza, and the fact that it was at the Aria which has a lot of prestige under its belt for its age.  We were quite impressed with the pizza and the service here. It's just swanky enough to feel like you're getting your money's worth but not so much that you forget that it's still a sports bar with a casual ambiance. They serve Fiji water, which was nice, albeit expensive. All-in-all, with two bottles of Fiji and our pizza, we spent about $45. Not terrible for Vegas, especially being in the Aria.  We've both decided this ranks as probably the 2nd or 3rd best pizza we've had in our lives, so, that says something!",

So let's rephrase that: I'm 5'2 sitting barefoot at these tall barstools.   Their napkins look like those blankets that newborn babies get swaddled in . It was weird wiping my face and reliving the birth of my children.   Anyway... The pizza came. We got the Gotham which is pretty much code for $28 supreme pizza. But this was a superior supreme. The crust was crispy and chewy and airy at the same time. The cheese was perfectly gooey... It came like 20 minutes after we ordered which I guess is standard but it felt like forever because my toes were Kung fu gripping my shoes for dear life. I hate these bar stools but I love their pizza. And the lady that served us was nice.",

The place is right near the sports bookie in the casino and therefore it's very convenient. This is a good place if you need a meal but unfortunately it falls victim to the price inflation of the strip. 1 Slice is $6 and there might be 1 or 2 beers under $10. You're basically paying ballpark prices. Again, if you're in the Aria and you need a quick lunch this will definitely make do, but you're paying premium Vegas prices for non-premium, albeit serviceable food.",

The gotham is an awesome pizza, and even makes a great breakfast the next day too.  Don't miss out on the meatballs.   One thing that keeps me from giving it 5 stars is the bar menu.  When they first opened they had a decent amount of seasonal cocktails.  This went away a little while back and the bar focuses mainly on beers, ales, and cider.  One time we went and ordered margaritas, they went back 3 times for being undrinkable.  If they would amp up the cocktails then i'd go back to 5 stars.",

    "text": "Two course lunch special at 18, not a bad deal. We were staying in the Aria and were hungry before checkout and decided to give Five50 Pizza Bar a try. The service was ok, the food was okay. We didn't have reservations and checked in with the hostess who said there was about a forty minute wait for a table but there were open seats in the bar. We decided to sit at the bar, but soon realized that the service at the bar was super slow. One bartender, ten plus seats. The bartender finally gave us some menus and more than enough time to decide. We went with the two course lunch special: first course: seasonal soup or the spinach and pear salad, second course: mezza luna pasta, personal pizza (up to three toppings), or a specialty pizza. I went with the seasonal soup which was tomato bisque and the Farmstead specialty pizza. The bartender was super sweet but was also super busy which led to a lot of wait time.  The tomato bisque was served first. It was a mediocre soup; creamy but a tad bland. I would have liked to have a piece of bread or some type of carb to go with it. It was not anything beyond mediocre. After what felt like a long time of waiting, our individual sized pizzas arrived at the bar. The Farmstead pizza is topped with creme fraiche, country olives, prosciutto, arugula and a farm egg. This sounded a lot tastier on paper than when it came out. They are very stingy with the ingredients and my pizza was a bit bland. I was expecting the egg to be cooked over easy on the pizza but instead the yolk on the egg was fully cooked and I was not able to disperse it all over the pizza. Disappointing. I was also missing the ooey gooey cheesiness of a traditional pizza.  Conclusion: I should've went with the personal create-your-own pizza. I assumed that the specialty pizzas were the way to go but it just meh. I saw a few unoccupied tables throughout the meal and wondered why the wait time was said to be forty minutes. The pros about Five50 Pizza Bar is that you can get a whole pizza or an individual slice, the two course lunch special for 18 bucks, and they are open late for that nice greasy \"had too much to drink\" slice. The cons: pizza was dry and the ingredients were scarce, the flavors did not blow me away, and you can get a tastier (and cheaper) slice of pizza on the strip. I wouldn't go out of my way to come back.",

    "text": "GREAT FIND ! My wife and I were in Las Vegas in 2017 for 2 days to attend a birthday party for a dear Aussie friend. Everyone attending the birthday celebration was booked into the huge Aria Resort & Casino complex. We flew in on July 2nd from San Diego, CA and believe it or not it was 113F when we walked outside the airport terminal at around midday catch a cab to our hotel. After checking in we decided to find a place within the hotel that served great craft beer because I needed a really satisfying beer after our flight. Our first choice seemed a winner with a huge craft beer selection but after getting slugged over $18 with tip for a glass of Delirium Tremens at a well-known pub inside The Shoppes at Crystals I was suffering tourist price shock. We left there in a hurry to head back into the Aria Casino itself and discovered the Five50 Pizza Bar. They served wood fired New York style Neapolitan thin crust pizzas ...just our model ! It was like a welcoming breath of fresh air from the moment we walked in with a nice big open space, cool wall decor and good classic rock music cranking out. We found a table and before we knew it a friendly server with a big smile greeted us to take our lunch order. This place was a great choice and it kept getting better. I kicked things off with a Victory Brewing Golden Monkey Belgian - Style Tripel.....my absolute favorite craft beer ! After studying the impressive pizza menu we ordered a large Gotham Pizza to share...$28 I believe. My craft beer tasted really good and was a decent price...no more than 10 bucks from memory. Our huge 16 inch pizza came out in a few minutes and looked fantastic on it's elevated rack. Our obliging server grated some fresh Parmigiano Reggiano Cheese over our pizza and we dug in. The pizza was full of flavor and the sauce was particularly outstanding. I ordered a Duvel Belgian Golden Ale....reasonably priced at $9 for a 12 oz bottle. My wife and I even struck up a friendly conversation with a young couple at an adjacent table. This pizza restaurant played excellent classic rock background music the whole time we were there and we enjoyed the overall atmosphere a lot. We loved our huge gourmet pizza and I enjoyed a couple of great craft beers at a fair price. There is also a beautiful looking full bar and an extensive wine list to complement the great craft beer choice. I read later that this classy restaurant is headed up by James Beard Award winning Chef Shawn McClain so that says something. We think this place inside the Aria Resort & Casino is a top value eatery worth visiting on the Las Vegas strip !",

The meat had plenty of flavor and the pepperoni was crispy and thin. I was pleasantly surprised at how much I enjoyed eating the toppings lol. Cheese was abundant and delicious as well. Lots of stretchy gooey goodness with each bite! I would have given this place 5 stars, but I feel it really falls short in terms of the crust. With everything so flavorful and delicious it really contrasts the plain and burnt tasting crust. It felt like I was eating cardboard at some parts lol. If they added some garlic or cheese flavor to the crust then it would have been perfect.  One pizza was enough to fill up 2 people and it only cost about $35 which is pretty good considering it is a meal on the strip.  Overall I'd recommend for you guys to check this place out if you haven't don't do yet. It is easily one of my favorite pizza spots on the strip and I'll probably be back to try out their other flavors. Hopefully the crust will be better lol.",

I received brief acknowledgement of my existence at the end of our visit when the waiter said goodnight after I had paid with my credit card (which had a name that is ethnic enough to not be confused as my partner's). The food was a 5 but the service was a 1; overall, the visit was a 3.",

There was a wait, which is fine but the young lady at the front wasn't greeting anyone like you want to be greeted but rather trying to keep the he order of who is next right in her mind instead of writing it down. The waiter did his best I guess seeing as they were clearly understaffed. I had the meatball sandwich which was extremely dry, hardly any cheese and came out luke warm. They were so busy I didn't bother sending it back. I probably wouldn't come back here as other hotels have solid pizza spots with better service for the price.",

Gourmet toppings are amazing.  The Truffle pizza with crisp smoked bacon, truffles and potatoes with a cream sauce is amazing.  More traditional, the Gotham has pepperoni, sausage and olives, but their tomato sauce tastes so fresh, perfect!  Add to that a fantastic beer selection and consistent service, plus doesn't hurt to be conveniently inside the Aria hotel, Vegas.  Worth a visit or a late night snack!",

    "text": "September 7th, 2017: It's the first game of the football season.  The Patriots are playing (and losing to) the Kansas City Chiefs, I've been eating rich seafood for the past couple of days, and all I want is to toss back a Moscow Mule and eat a slice of pie (with more seafood on it lol).  We got some wings and the North Beach pizza.  Those wings are ridiculously good.  I didn't even think I wanted wings at first but I'm glad they were ordered.  Perfectly fried, enough vinegar for a decent pucker, and the sauce had a nice steady heat.   The North Beach Pizza [Clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano - \"An Italian immigrant neighborhood, the home of Marilyn and Joe Dimaggio, the cradle of the beatnik movement, and a delectable pizza inspired by the heritage of the north bay.\"]: This pie was also delicious.  Served hot from the oven with a delicious grey char on the crust.  I was hoping for a white sauce but it worked well with the sweet tomato sauce.  The sweetness from the tomatoes complimented the sweetness of the clams.  I would still rather have clam pizza with white sauce though.  The pizza was foldable without dropping any toppings and easy to chow down.  We ended up boxing the leftovers to eat cold the next morning.  Five50 is located right next to the Sportsbook inside Aria.  So if you wanna watch the game or a fight, this is the place to be if you still want to eat, drink, and be comfortable while watching TV.  Plus you'll be away from the cigarette and cigar smoke!  It's a 3.5 stars place and a $30 pizza but since I'm vacationing, I'll round up.  It's not the best pie on The Strip but it still made this gal happy.",

This place was a pleasant surprise, and reminded us of the wood fire pizza restaurants we frequent at home. Pizzas were the same price range we are used to paying at home, mid to high $20 which is surprising with it located in a casino. My husband had one of their IPAs, and the pizza was quickly delivered to the table. We sat and watched half a game, and took a few pieces of pizza with us for breakfast the next morning. Really one of the best meals for a great price on the steip.",

Could've been ok if the server had checked in with us, but beer and pizza arrived at the same time, and we didn't see our server until I waved my credit card in their face as they were walking by.

Our waiter was excellent, not fake or over the top, but super knowledgeable and efficient. It was busy, prime time, so we did wait a while for stuff to show up at the table, but we were there to relax and have good conversation, so nobody minded waiting. Plus, the pizza chefs are back there making everything from scratch, so you know, it takes time. My Bloody Mary was perfect. The Caesar salad was incredible. We ordered three pizzas and they were all to die for. We ordered two desserts, which were both splendid. Afterwards, the waiter was very kind about taking photos of our little group for us. What more could you want?  Yeah, it's oily. Sure, it's fattening. It was a little bit of a wait at times for food to arrive.  They're busy, because it's really good. Have a cocktail and enjoy being out! (Also, they have tons of pizza by-the-slice business, so all in all, I think they were doing a great job of handling the rush.) I would recommend this place to anyone coming to Vegas looking for epic pizza.",

We were staying there at Aria so we took our slices back to our room. After I ate my slice, my mouth watered for more. So much that my husband and I couldn't wait to buy a whole pizza to take home the next day. We got the Gotham pizza. I can't say anything about the other kinds because we didn't try those. The meat was very tasty on the pizza and the crust was really nice. I'm glad I don't live in Vegas because I would be going to this place every week. I definitely look forward to going back on our next visit to Vegas. It is expensive for a whole pizza...

They each looked great.  I went with the meat lovers pizza, see the picture.  The pizzas appear to be from a fire oven. I feel that adds a little extra taste, as long as it is not burned.  Also, they were not just out of the oven, so they had time to set. This was truly a great pizza. 9.5/10 While I ordered the pizza to go, they have a few standing tables to eat your slice.  Also, just around the corner is a cafe you can sit down to eat.   Ciao",

Usually I am a huge fan of white cheese pizza, but something in this one just didn't work... (Note: pizzas are big enough for 2).  My mom ordered the meatball sub which was actually pretty good. We didn't care for the chips that came on the side.  I do have to say that the apple squash soup was good.  For dessert we had the vanilla ice cream sandwich. It came on a thin and crispy wafer.  Was different but good.  The service wasn't good.  Maybe because our server had to work on Christmas, but either way. When we were done we sat with dirty dishes in front of us for a long time before anyone came to ask if we wanted boxes or dessert.  Our waters were also completely empty and we had to hunt our server down.  The manager came by to check on us but we didn't want to get anyone in trouble  Food wasn't great and neither was the service.    2 pizzas, 2 subs, a soup, 2 sodas, and one dessert came out to $125.  I'll have to try something different if there is a next time...",

It's located right by the Aria sports book near the Zarkana entrance.  The Aria signed an exclusive joint venture with the James Beard Award-Winning Chef and Restaurateur Shawn McClain. To have his name behind it, you know this place will receive top notch quality control and ingredients.  This place makes me love the Aria poker room even more now. (I'm going to gain so much weight from these pizzas everyday LOL)  I believe pizza by the slice goes for $5.50, and apparently they set oven temperatures to 550 Fahrenheit, and at 5:50 pm happy hour starts! (Hence the name Five 50) Pretty catchy I say. Oh and thanks for this information Nelson Q. :p  I tried three 16 inch pizzas with friends. All priced around $27-29. They were the:  TRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, bechamel, fresh thyme, truffles  BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar  FARMSTEAD: country ham, creme fraiche, farm egg, olives  I would say the crowd favorite out of those three was the Truffle, definitely a unique pizza! The Blanco was very good as well, and the Farmstead wasn't our favorite. Just the over easy farm eggs on top where the egg yolk starts dripping everywhere wasn't the best texture and consistency to have on a pizza.  This place is a great upscale pizza joint and I would highly recommend a visit here if you absolutely love pizza and stopping by the Aria! The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is honestly because I've had better pizzas elsewhere in my lifetime. :p",

Honestly, the food was ok but it wasn't even close to what I would call great pizza.

    "text": "So I've been meaning to write a review about this place, bc I came here with a group of 11 and they were SO accommodating!  We got to sit at their special table reserved for larger parties, which was super luxe and somewhat sectioned off, which I like.  The only problem with this table is the fact that there really isn't much room between the chairs and the \"wall,\" so it seemed like the servers were having a hard time getting around us.  Not a big deal since we made do, but a bit of a design snafu.  They have a great selection of cocktails, wines, and beers, although it's vegas and I was pretty hungover so I had iced tea instead (this was ok, but had an over-steeped, bitter aftertaste).  Since a portion of our party got there first, we decided to order a couple of salads: we had one with arugula and one with burrata.  Of the two, no contest: the burrata was the clear winner, the perfect riff on your classic Caprese.  Being that our group was so large, we just decided to order one of each of their specialty pizzas.  In addition to your standard fare like Margherita pizza and Sicilian, they also had a few more unique ones - one with clams, one with truffles, and another with egg!  The pizzas are actually a lot bigger than I thought they would be; they're 16 inches in diameter.  I didn't get to try all of them, but the two I did have were SO delicious: the Forager (with mushrooms) and the Farmstead (the one with egg - mind you, I'm a huge sucker for runny eggs).  TIP: Not sure if it's standard that they bring hot chili oil with the food, but if you don't get it, ask for it.  That stuff is amazing.  Because we ordered so many pizzas, they notified us that it would take a bit for them to come out.. That being said, they brought out a few of their appetizers to tide us over.  The toasted marcona almonds were good (although not as crunchy as I would like), the olives were really unctious and delicious (but if I could eat one thing for the rest of my life it would probably be olives, so I'm slightly biased), the veggies were pretty standard (good but unremarkable), and the chicharrones are the best darn chicharrones I've ever had (haven't had a wide variety, but these were perfectly seasoned and fried).  The service was great, although there were a few kinks here and there.  Drinks took a while to refill and such, but it was their second day of operation and the rest of the friendly service more than made up for it.",

Certainly, this isn't delivery pizza, and is a just a notch above a CPK. The crust is fluffy and yet at the same time crisp, and the toppings are clearly of a high quality.  We tried the Blanca with spicy italian sausage and the Truffle as well. We enjoyed both of them thoroughly.   Certainly, you are paying a premium here. 22 (cheese) to 29 (truffle) for a (non gigantic) pizza is at best considered \"casino\" pricing, and at worst, just flat out a rip-off. I don't think I could even justify coming here to spend 5.50 on a slice, as the slices aren't really \"meal\" sized like some places.  We also had the pork belly appetizer, which, when digested with all the ingredients in a single bite, was just absolutely incredibly. Still, it would be 15 dollars had we been paying ourselves.  In the end, it wasn't a bad experience at all - in fact, service was really good and we came away very happy. However, the bill without consideration of comps would have been 100 dollars before tip (3 beers too). That's a lot for a pizza meal! It was good, but not THAT good...",

We were about to order and then we were seated.  The person (who I assume was our server) came over to fill our water glasses.  He never even looked at us or said anything, clinked the glass water bottle on my friend's cup and then spilled water all over my glass and never acknowledged any of this, just walked away.  He didn't seem new or clumsy, just didn't give a crap about his job.  We looked over the menu and were disappointed to see they had something called \"mozzarella bar\" but it was really just a list of meat and cheese for a charcuterie plate and only one type of mozzarella; I had seen this online originally and was excited to try some new cheeses. After at least 5 minutes of sitting there with no one coming back over (and they had plenty of servers to handle the people there) we decided to leave.

Walked in at around 330pm and was able to find a spot at the bar. Ordered some drinks and appetizers just to kill time and hang out.   - Old Fashion - this is one of the best that I've had since the one I've tried in TN. They squeeze fresh orange to give it a fresh taste and it's absolutely perfect.  - Bloody Mary - they use fresh ingredients and a homemade tomato juice that's absolutely amazing.   - Beef Carpaccio - this was just ok, it came with arugula, sliced beets and peanuts.  - Chef's 3 - we chose burrata, mortadello, and cappicola. It was an amazing mix of meat and cheese. It was served with their homemade mustard, pickled veggies and olives.   I would definitely come back here for their old fashion, it was my absolute favorite. Staff are very friendly and tentative. Great food, great drinks and great service!",

    "text": "The BEST Pizza in Vegas.  Apparently just declaring best in show isn't enough.. Is it the unique quality of toppings and tastes?? Is it the fact the pizza is cooked in a wood-burning oven?? Or that for a few dollars and two minutes time, you can eat amazing pizza without any hassle.   There is a full bar and restaurant seating in case you want to wine and dine but no matter any of the additional critiques that might go into these reviews, the pizza is so GOOD that even if the waiter dropped a plate or forgot my Coke and called me silly, I'd still award 5stars cause it tastes that much better than any other pizza I can think of within any reasonable distance.",

It was an easy, comfortable spot for dinner as well as for drinks and dessert after some time on the casino floor. The only problem with Five50 Pizza Bar was that the pizza was no good.  We came for an early Sunday dinner after driving in from LA with no particular plans. We were thinking about leaving the Aria, which is where we were staying, but inertia got the best of us when we stumbled across a pizza place right by the sports betting station. It was only 5:30, but we were hungry after our time on the road, and the restaurant was beautifully empty.  I liked the vibe of the place. Very much of one piece with the Aria, ritzy and modern with high ceilings and interesting decor, but casual and fuss-free. There was a large bar that ended up being half the point of the place, and service was solid. We ended up coming back with a couple more friends when we needed a place to catch up later in the night. We brought our leftover pizza for them to eat, and our server didn't call us out for having the take-out box on the table.  That pizza, though, was some of the worst I've had in a while--no contest when measured against others in its price range. These were expensive personal pies, and they just didn't taste good. They were flawed on a basic level, limp and greasy with way too much cheese. The toppings were good, at least. The Catania came with white sauce, garlic puree, Italian sausage, rapini, and roasted tomato; the Forager with white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. Pretty good ideas, but not enough to redeem the pizzas.  Weirdly, everything else was great. The beet salad was excellent, a colorful mix of local beets with watercress, farro, pumpkinseed vinaigrette, and grissini. One of my friends doesn't like burrata, so we got it with goat cheese--accommodating kitchen, and a nice substitution. When we came back after dinner, I had some kind of craft beer on tap (I forget which, but it was a good one), and partook in a couple of decadent milkshakes. The Vegas root beer float was a satisfying shake loaded with vanilla ice cream, caramel, Butterfinger crumbles, and Boylan's root beer. The mint chocolate swirl mixed mint ice cream with chocolate syrup and chocolate mint cookies--what's not to like there? All shakes were available in adult iterations, but the beer was good enough for me.  I enjoyed Five50 Pizza Bar despite its failure to deliver good pizza. I'd recommend it for an easy drink or meal if you're hanging out at the Aria. I wouldn't hesitate to go back; I just might avoid the signature offerings.",

But we ordered the small mac and cheese the arugula salad and a pizza with tasted like an alfredo sauce with tomato, sausage some type of greenery I'm assuming it was maybe little broccoli it was absolutely incredible! We ate as much as we can it had so much flavor! This is probably the best pizza in Vegas! We ate at a couple other places this past weekend and it was just basic Pizza it was crap but this pizza was awesome the mac and cheese was so juicy and Rich and tons of sauce and flavor! The arugula salad was a healthy portion and tons of fennel! Ask for a little bit more dressing or lemon with Cracked Pepper on the top it was awesome! The service was great as well our waiter was awesome and excited to help us! We just kind of wandered around Vegas until I got tired of walking and I stopped here and said to please and that was it be sad and it was the best decision we made! if I find the picture again on here on Yelp I will grab it and refer to it that's how I found it it was awesome!",

It wasn't bad or anything but it def wasn't memorable. We ordered the Gotham pizza which comes with pepperoni, sausage and salami. It was a little too much for me.   During the most recent Restaurant Week, I noticed they had a good lunch deal so my friend and I decided to give it another try. After we got there and saw what was including in the deal, it seemed like a better idea to just order what we wanted. It probably came out to the same price and it was good we wanted to eat.  The garlic knots were decent. Nothing to rave about. The pizza is cooked in a wood fired oven, at 550 degrees. :) This time we ordered cheese and pepperoni. It wasn't bad but like I said, its not my favorite or that memorable. The service wasn't great. It took a while for drink refills and they weren't even that busy. Overall, I think this place is expensive for the quality. Considering the location, I guess it would be less expensive than the other options though.  Tip: They sell pizza by the slice. This would be a good option if you're staying at the hotel or need something fast.",

We both ordered the POACHED PEAR SALAD (Benton's Country Ham, Wine Poachachached Pear, Babyabyaby Greens, Toasted Pistachio's, & White Balsamic Vinaigrette) it was delicious.The lunch pizza comes with the choice of 3 toppings. I choose (italian sausage, meatballs, and onion) The crust is thin and tasty,and the wood fired crust was cooked perfectly. There's the perfect amount of sauce, and the shredded Mozzarella cheese is creamy with an amazing richness. Two people could likely split a pizza especially if you get a salad or appetizers. The pizza truly has \"east coast's bold flavors and Italy's delicacy to create something totally unique.\" They sell pizza by the slice, highly recommend giving it a try.",

Not a big deal - we planned quite enough time before the show and weren't in a rush.  We shared everything:  Garlic Knots ($6): Great portion and huge knots. Really tasty.  Beer Mac 'n Cheese ($12 - half order): Again, good portion size and really good - the prosciutto is a nice touch.  Chef's Selection Charcuterie (6 for $28): I know it seems pricey, but man was it worth it! They were not stingy with the meat/cheese and we actually got to choose the 6 we wanted. We went with both Burrata and Buffalo Mozzarella, as well as the Humbodlt Fog. For meats we had Mortadella, Soppressata and Prosciutto. Everything was really fresh and SO SO good. i would definitely order this again and it was perfect for sharing.  Finally we got the Gotham pizza ($28): Also pricey, but we both really enjoyed it. It had pepperoni, salami and sausage.   We ended up with way too much food and were stuffed. They also have good drink specials - I thought the prices for the beer/shot combos were really good and they have a great selection of beers.  The 2nd time I dined there, I just grabbed a quick slice from the slice counter. The great thing is that the counter is open until 3 AM on Fri/Sat. It was just $5.95 for a HUGE slice of pizza and it was really good. This time I got the \"Forager,\" which has whitesauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta and spinach. I've been dreaming about this slice ever since.  Overall, it fits a certain \"niche,\" it's connected to the Race & Sports Book and can be considered a fast casual experience. Or you can grab a slice on your way back to your room - both are great options. I'll definitely be back soon!",

Both filled us up pretty well.  The drink menu was pretty standard that had decent choice of beers and cocktails for those interested.  The restaurant itself is nice and cozy for the most part.  Most of the tables either surround the oven or the bar area, which is located in the middle.    You can also grab pizzas to go to from the front, which is good as well.

They pop the slice into their wood burning oven for a minute to warm it up. You can tell they use high quality ingredients, and the Grana Padana cheese really stands out. The toppings, especially the pepperoni, are nice and crunchy thanks to the high heat of said wood burning oven. It was ~$9 with tip (I tip, even on to-go orders) and it was worth every penny. So much so that I got another slice Thurs. night to bring back home. Ate the slice Fri., and yes, the crunchiness of the toppings and the dough did suffer, but it was still better than anything I could have gotten elsewhere, even freshly baked. Can't wait to grab another fresh piece (or maybe a whole pizza) the next time we're back, especially since we usually stay at Aria or Vdara.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I walked into a restaurant filled with screaming football fans this past Sunday afternoon.  Being that we are not sporting fans we were quickly annoyed but got over it and settled in at the bar (which was not crowded)  We ordered a couple of cheese slices, caesar salad, and the italian hero.  All were awesome, fresh, and decent in portion.  However, service was lack luster.  Originally my boyfriend ordered the meatball sandwich and out came the Italian sandwich instead.  We didn't care and we have both worked in the industry and understand these things happen but when the bartender looked at us like you have two heads and claims that we didn't order the meatball sandwich, I was a little put off.  Whatever, I was hungry and with that I ordered an additional cheese slice and again I got that look from our bartender like \"Really, you guys want ANOTHER slice, how could you?!\"  It was odd.  Also, our drinks were left empty after we finished our first glass and remained that way for the entire meal, we were never offered a refill (again we didn't mind and god forbid we ask for something else we would like to consume!). Food....awesome. Design.....awesome. Acoustics......not so awesome. Service......with an attitude.  Four stars because because we didn't get many items from the menu (but we will be back to try more) and that lame bartender is very replaceable and so I won't judge the restaurant, it's menu, or it's concept on something that is as disposable as a inefficient employee.",

It turned out to be the Five50. Best alternate plan ever.  I always judge a restaurant by customer service first then the food. The customer service was spot on the evening we were there. We had no wait, our order was taken quickly, drinks arrived in a timely manner, as did the food. The server, Sam, was very  friendly and courteous.  We had a basic pizza with onions and bacon. It came with full on slices of bacon and chunks of onion. No cutting back which made the price more than worth it.  It was hot, cheesy, and messy just like you'd expect a great pizza to be.  I'm not sure how to judge the cost. Yes it was expensive but it's Vegas and it's the Aria. What do you expect? As long as the customer service and food are above par then I'm fine with cost.  I can definitely recommend Five50 and we will be back.",

They didn't make the right pizza I ordered so they brought out the one they made and made up for it by making a bigger one of one I ordered. I would definitely come again.",

Did not come back until 5-10 minutes when we saw another guy who we called to our table but finally took the order of food and drink. Two glasses of beer took them 15 minutes to bring. Then we sat and waited for one appetizer (mac n cheese) and a chicken sandwich. After 35 minutes I showed my 35 minutes I showed my yelp checkin time that we have been waiting. He was very nice and apologetic. He brought the mac n cheese and said \"don't want to serve raw chicken\"! Please don't underestimate my knowledge about food! The sandwich arrived after exactly 47 minutes. Both mac n cheese and the chicken grilled sandwich tasted good just a little too fatty but ok. Waiter was also nice and gave me one extra glass of beer. He was trying to make it up for the almost an hour wait. I'll love to come back to try the pizza.",

I asked if this was Neapolitan Pizza and the guy seemed annoyed I was asking him a question. He said it was a hybrid between New York pizza and Neapolitan. I then asked him why the pizzas on the counter looked different than the one being made and he said because they are different pizzas. Obviously I knew the pizzas were different because of the different toppings, but I was basically getting at the pizzas have been out for too long that they look completely different from the one being freshly made. I then asked to speak with the manager to tell him about his employee who clearly was annoyed answering questions. He seemed to hear me but at the same time did not offer me a discount or anything to make up for the disappointing first impression. I should have left after this but I still ordered a slice of pizza. I ordered the spinach/ricotta/ mushroom pizza and it was just rich enough without being sickeningly rich. The crust had a sour flavor which is completely different from a New York pizza or Neapolitan. I appreciated them trying to be different but it was a little to sour for my taste. The crust was chewy, all the ingredients paired nicely together, and the sweetness of the ricotta helped balance out the sourness of the crust. I must say the pizza was pretty delicious, but the price is a little steep at almost $7 a slice.",

Not worth that kind if price but if you limit the $8 beers you'll be okay. I recommend getting whole pizza made for you and not settling for pizza that sits and waits at the pizza bar.",

This pizza was really disappointing.   $30 for a 16\" pizza that was literally dripping in grease. We had to use 4 napkins just to soak it up, it was served luke warm, had to be warmed up, which resulted in more grease. The crust was odd - it had a sour dough taste.",

There were 4 pizza choices but they seem to fly off the pan with everyone in line.  I had a slice of the forager pizza and 4 cheese.  Both slices were great tasting and the thin crust was nice and crispy.  It motivates me to try the full restaurant the next time I came.  The only reason I gave it 4 stars was the lack of choices at the quick service counter...it didn't look like they could make enough pizza's to keep up with the walk-ups so it was a downer not being able to get what you want...instead..settling for what was there at the time.",

We ordered the Gotham Pizza, which is \"supposed\" to include pepperone, sausage & salami, but there was ZERO salami, & only a smattering of sausage. Perhaps a dozen circles of pepperoni. Lots of cheese if that pleases you? For $28 I think customers should expect something \"better\". Onions? Peppers? Olives? Mushrooms?  However, anything above the minimal serving of meat, would push the price well above $30, since each ingredient adds another $2. For those who want to spend $30-40++ on a 16\" pizza, I wish them well. For us -- we go to Wolfgang Puck's in the Crystal Shopping Mall attached to ARIA, & get a better pizza for 1/2 the price.",

    "text": "Why is this place so hit and miss.. It used to be consistent with service and food but recently few times it's been below average. Came here this Fri and brought my friend and his family along because I told them it was the best pizza in town. I made reservations for 430pm and we were seated right away.. Our server was a guy who was a little cocky...but whatever he was still nice.   We ordered two pizzas and the first one I told him I wanted it well done.. He said they come out nice and crispy so no need to be well done.. Well this wasn't the pizza I was eating so ok.. The second pizza I ordered I wanted it well done because it was the one I was eating.. So again I told him I wanted this pizza well done and he said again they come out nice and crisy so no need.. I told him I always get it well done n they have always done it for me.. And he again said no need and don't worry about it.. It'll come out nice. Ok whatever..  Well when we got our pizzas.. Guess what... Not well done enough.. And the 2nd pizza..the one I was eating was warm not hot n the veggies were on the luke warm side.. Like they had it sitting there before the other pizza was done.. Well I was irritated because i wanted a well done pizza and trusted the server which I should not have.. Now for me to send the pizza back to have them atleast reheat it would take another 10-15 mins.. Which means half the table would be eating while the other half waited. At this point I was so pissed off I would have said something to the server but I wouldn't have been nice about it. So I bit my tongue n ate the pizza. Next time I go il make sure I do not get the same server.",

So I am sitting there over 20 minutes and I am thinking to myself it is taking so long because they ran out and had to bake a new pie.   The slice was delicious when it finally came. A couple sat down next to me and ordered a couple of slices and they had them in 2 or 3 minutes. Wat?  I spoke to the manager on the way out and asked him why mine took over 20 minutes and the people next to me to maybe 3 minutes at the most. He stated, \"maybe she forgot to order it\".   I don't really care the reason because this was a broken first expereince. I did not ask for anything. I did clearly tell the manager that I needed to know why the delay for my Yelp review.  One might think, in Las Vegas, that a manager might comp a $7.00 slice of pizza or offer me something to bring me back.  5 stars for the food. 1 star for feeling like I was jacked around after the delay.",

I really loved it, the only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was it was pricey.  I had a slice of Gotham.  This is a great NY pizza.  The ingredients and sauce were on point.  The pizza was piping hot fresh, the bottom was nice and crunch but never burnt!!  The dough was so good.  If you want thin crust pizza, cooked NY style, with no black burnt spots and tastes great, this is it.  I only wanted to have one slice before going to bed, I ended up having a second slice was it was so good!  Additionally, the waitresses are lovely and friendly.  My server was Megan and she was great!  Customer service was excellent and fast, refills on drinks without asking.  I will return again to Five50!",

You choose between a salad or soup, then choose between a pasta or an individual pizza. $18. If you want to  you can add a milkshake for $5. The pizza was much bigger than any personal pizza I've seen before. You can choose from their options or build your own with up to three toppings.  Delicious crust, delicious toppings.

It was almost closing time but the gentleman at the counter was super cool and even boxed up our 4 slices in the big pizza box. We went with 2 slices of Gotham (pepperoni, salami, sausage, mozzarella and grana padano) and 2 slices of Forager (white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta & spinach). Both pizza types were good and definitely hit the spot. The slices are big and the crust is great. Great flavor combinations, the both of them. Re-heated in their wood burning pizza oven at just the right temperature and length. We really enjoyed it.  We stay at City Center often so we will definitely have to try and have a sit-down meal at Five50 next time. Located inside Aria Hotel right before the sports book. Very busy area of the casino so you may think all they sell is pizza. But they have a full menu of Italian fare.",

We spent the night here and we decided to try it out because we were hungry and it was late. The garlic knots were hard and doughy in the middle, but the tomato sauce dip was redeeming. The margherita pizza is positively one of the worst in town. I have lived in Vegas for 5 years and I have tried many different pizza places. I would rank this below Costco and tie it with Little Ceasar's. The dough was like a busciut, tough and dry. The sauce was a joke. The whole pizza was a joke, especially at $30!! (You can get arguably the best margherita pizza in town for only $15 at Settebello).  The experience there is not for the faint if heart, as it may very well ruin ones day.",

Numerous restaurants state that they use only the freshest ingredients, but at Five50 Pizza you can taste the freshness.   I brought two finicky eaters with me for my first visit. We ordered a Margherita pizza and a Caesar salad. Five50 Pizza took two very simplistic dishes and made them extraordinary. I loved the crust, the sauce, the cheese...EVERYTHING!! Even my picky eaters couldn't get enough of the pizza and salad.  Five50 Pizza doesn't try be something they're not. So, don't come here expecting Chicago style pizza. They actually have more of a East Coast meets Italy vibe, so it's big but not greasy. You can't go wrong getting a pizza pie here.",

I wanted something quick to eat before I went to bed and was happy to learn they had a pizza restaurant in the casino.  I headed down and ordered my two slices and a bottled water to bring up to the room.  The wait was short, the service was friendly but the price was ridiculous, about $25.00 for 2 slices and a bottled water?  You have to be kidding me.  I was expensing it for work, so I wasn't too worried about it, but still that is a bit ridiculous especially considering a whole pizza is a little over $30.00.  Had I been provided a refrigerator in my room I would have just went for the whole pizza since it is a better deal.  Anyway, I ordered the Gotham, the slices were pretty big and the flavor was on point.  Probably some of the tastiest pizza I have ever had.    Bottom line... To be honest I would definitely go again even with the outrageous pricing.",

We also shared the Gothom pizza (priced at 28.00) which was 16 inch topped with a variety of Italian meats. It was thin crust right out of the very hot oven. Tasted like it came from New York and although we were stuffed we enjoyed it to the very last bite. There is no reason to not give this place a 5 star but the management had only one server for the restaurant. As good as he was he was over worked.",

    "text": "Aria employees got a little taste of Chef Shawn McClain's Five 50 Pizza Bar slated to open on July 4th, at the former Skybox location. I  was lucky enough to try two of the eight pizzas available. I tried:  GOTHAM: sausage, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella, grana padano  THE FORAGER: mushrooms, spinach, rosemary, and whipped ricotta  Both were very delicious, and the crust was perfectly crunchy with a nice chewiness, and tons better than Secret(ly pathetic)Pizza across the street. Other offerings they will have-  MARGHERITA: tomato, basil, and mozzarella  NORTH BEACH: clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, and oregano  FARMSTEAD: country ham, creme fraiche, farm egg, olives  SICILIAN: pancetta, broccoli rabe, pepper flakes, and white anchovies  TRUFFLE: potato, truffle salami, bechamel, fresh thyme, truffles  BLANCO: fresh mozzarella, ricotta, olive oil, chopped garlic, basil, and white cheddar  I also overheard  one of the guys saying that a couple of different sizes were going to be offered and prices weren't available at the time. they were also in the process of finalizing all menu items.  Other fun facts:  550- The ideal oven temperature for Chef McClain's pizzas, and 5:50pm....the start of Happy Hour!  It will be an open kitchen with three different areas:  SLICE COUNTER: You will be able to walk up and order a slice and grab a cold one  CRAFT BEER BAR: Full service bar in a centralized location featuring 6-10 craft beers  MAIN DINING ROOM: a combination of two and four tops with communal dining to accommodate all guests  Stop in for a slice or a whole pie..It is Dee-Lish!!!    ALOHA!!!",

    "text": "I was really excited when I heard there was going to be a new pizza restaurant opening up in Aria.  So I dropped in to check out this new pizza joint at Aria called Five50 with a friend after work. It is the second restaurant opened by Chef Shawn McClain (Sage) at Aria, so the expectation of excellent food was high.  The Five50 name seems strange, but according to them is the ideal temperature for cooking your pizza in the oven (so is that Fahrenheit or Celsius?). And until just last week, 5:50pm was the start of their Happy Hour and the promotion was 50 cents beer.  Now HH is from 5PM to 5:50pm (is it still considered a happy HOUR if it only lasts 50 minutes).  $5.50 might also be the starting price of their pizza by the slice (don't hold to it in case I am mistaken, but it would fit the pattern of this gimmicky name).   The restaurant is beautifully designed.  It looks great from the outside, although the \"VIP\" area near the back and by that \"wall\" is just too cramp to be fully functional.  Service was friendly and efficient. Since the restaurant is still new, it also appears that they have way more staff on duty than are needed.  Will be interesting to see if the staffing level will remain at current level in 2-3 months.    After looking over the menu, which is mostly a beverage menu (the entire outside cover of the menu is the wine, beer, etc menu), while the inside menu consist of Snacks (5 items), Small Plates (your upscale appetizers), Salads, Pastas, Meat & Cheese, and the 8 pizza selections or you can customize your own.  Tried the Forager Pizza (Mushrooms, Spinach, Rosemary, Whipped Ricotta) and it was good. The pizza crust was the star, while the toppings were quality it was also  not exactly generous.  If I was hungry and didn't have a late lunch, I can totally finish this 16\" pizza myself and not break a AYCE sushi coma sweat.  So it was not even a challenge to split it with another person.  If I come back I will want to try their Gotham and Truffle pizzas.  Their Small  Plates and Pasta items sound interesting too, which may actually be the more exciting offerings from Chef Shawn McClain's new pizza joint/craft beer sports bar.  Food:  3.5/5  Quality ingredients used on tasty flat bread pizza, part of the overall tasty crunchy crust was sadly burnt.  Creativity:  2.5/5  Nothing that I have not already seen done somewhere else.  Considering the talent of a chef that bested an American Iron Chef, I know this place has way more to offer in this department.   Price/Value:  3/5  Casino pricing for the convenience of not having to walk or take a cab somewhere else.  If you want better value for your dining dollars, get a panini sandwich from Jean Philippe Patisserie (in Aria and Bellagio).  Service: 3/5  Never had bad experience from any of the wait staff at Aria, but waitstaff could be better trained on what is offered on the menu.  Are breadsticks complimentary? If so, we didn't get any while we waited for the pizza.  Decor:  3.5/5  Hip, upscale decor with dim lighting that fits the overall darker color scheme of Aria (not my style preference, but I just like the brighter more energetic look of other interior decorator's executed vision more).  A-OK and perfect for guests in Aria and CityCenter complex.  (Needs better HH)",

The concept had a lot of promise - a grab and go pizza joint located right next to the poker room, race & sports book, and casino. I redeemed MyVegas rewards to get what was billed as a slice and a beer for about 10,000 points. To redeem points,  you have to go to the mLife desk in the casino. The clerk gave me a $17 voucher good for whatever I wanted at Five50, which made me realize that a slice of pizza and a beer cost 17 dollars?!?!?   I ended up redeeming for two slices of pizza and a bottle of diet coke for $15. I got the Gotham and the Margherita - both were good, but nothing I'd clamor to return for. They set up some round tables off to the side near the entrance to the Sports Book for people who just want to grab a quick slice. Frankly, I still prefer the pizza over at the Cosmopolitan's secret pizza place more, but Five50 is a decent option within Aria.",

It had just the right amount of cheese on and they blended together to make a delicious gooey topping. The tomato sauce had a good tang to it and wasn't too sweet and the crust was golden delicious.   I wish they stayed open later though as it would be the perfect snack to refuel my gambling habit.",

I called restaurant reservations and they said we can bring pizza from Five50 to The Lemon Grass (the Thai restaurant in Aria). So we got 2 slices of pizza for the kids.  But because the wait time was too long at the Thai restaurant we decided to dine at Five50 as well.  They won't let my kids to go into the restaurant because they were holding their slices of pizza.  Are you kidding me???  I find that hard to believe!!  They let us bring pizza to another restaurant to eat but not in there own restaurant???  My kids felt unwelcome that they couldn't go in to join the family to eat but had to stand outside to finish their slices of pizza before they can go into the restaurant?!  I understand that the restaurant wants the customers to enjoy the whole dining experience and not to eat the take out pizza in the dining room. But that's just 2 little kids that were hungry. The rest of the family were still going to order from the dine in menu.  I found that very unreasonable and total lack of flexibility!!!

It was delicious, and the freshness of the ingredients was apparent. My only issue is the value proposition, which cost it a 5th star.  They only offer one size (16\"), which is too much for one person, but not enough for two, and they run around the $30 range. It was a great pizza, but should have been at least $10 less.  Because of the price of the pizza, I didn't get one of the delicious sounding milkshakes on the menu.  I would have ended up spending close to $50 for one person on a light meal.  Bonus:  Located at Aria Resort in Las Vegas, this is the only location and is headed by James Beard Award-winning Chef Shawn McClain.",

She seemed highly annoyed and was really short with us.  We felt like we were bothering her.  Two pizzas and two appetizers took 30 mins to appear and someone in a suit brought it to the table.  There was a nice bus boy that refilled our water and was doing all the busy work for Amanda.  I work in the foods industry as did everyone at my table.  We could tell Amanda had a lot of tables but we watched her make this poor bus boy do all the heavy lifting while she just kind of drifted around the dining room.

    "text": "Lunch is a forgotten meal in Vegas.  Endless crowds queue up and drop benjamins on brunch and dinner -- but nobody gives a damn about lunch anymore.  While I mourn the decline of lunch, I also take full advantage of it.   That means finding the best lunch specials available -- and the lunch special at Five50 Pizza Bar is a perfect example.  I normally wouldn't go out of my way for a place like Five50, since similar concepts are a dime a dozen in San Diego.  What San Diego doesn't have, though, is an excellent pizza-centric lunch special, consisting of soup and personal pizza for a mere $18.  (San Diego also doesn't have a restaurant with Shawn McClain's name behind it.)  When I dropped by at around 11:30am on a Friday, the crowd was evenly split between twentysomethings nursing hangovers with take-out, business travelers and solo diners at the bar, and larger families and groups in the dining room.  Five50 is actually very easy on the eyes, with retro-style murals on one wall and cool interlocking wooden brick latticework on another.  Since Five50 is tucked in the very back of the Aria casino, thru-traffic is minimal, making it a surprisingly quiet and subdued place to grab a meal.  Like I mentioned, it's really all about the lunch special here.  The soup of the day was minestrone, which was absolutely perfect -- warm, hearty, comforting, and healthy to boot.  For the pie, I tried the truffle pizza, which comes with salami, potato, and creamy bechamel.  While the flavor of the pizza was good, it was also a total greasebomb.  I also wish the potatoes hadn't been so hard and undercooked.  Service is fine in that stand-offish, I-have-no-reason-to-friendly-to-you-since-you're-a-tourist-who'll-never-come-back-here sort of way, which is typical of the Strip.   That said, I'll still probably come back next time I'm in town, if for no other reason than that lunch special.  Join me in my crusade to make lunch the new brunch!",

I mean c'mon it's pizza and this is Vegas!! But boy was I totally completely wrong because the pizza was so freakin delicious!!!!  We ordered 2 whole pizzas: Gotham and Forger and 2 salads: Caesar and Italian. We picked up our togo 50 mins later and headed off the strip to our friend's house, which was 25 mins away.   Once we got there, we all dug in. To my complete surprise, the pizza was still crunchy and not the least bit soggy. The dough was so perfect and the flavors all meld together in harmony. It was so good that I ate a total of 3 1/2 slices (the slices are huge!). I really couldn't believe how good the pizzas were!   Now I can't wait to go back to Vegas to grab some pizza. I wouldn't recommend the salads though. It was small and boring. Skip it.  Remember, the next time your SO suggest to get pizza, don't be an ass because you might end up eating your own words like I did.",

    "text": "Pizza, renowned chef, located in my fav LV  hotel...what's not to like? I'll get to that shortly.  I guess the name comes from the ideal temp to cook a pie in the oven. What I will say is it made for a comical exchange between me and concierge to see if we could get a reservation:  [Curtains part, our hero stands outside in sunny SoCal in front of a non-descript office building filled with boring ass people.]  \"[Man answers phone] Hello, mlife concierge, how may I help you today?\" \"Hi, can I book a reservation at Five50?\" \"Certainly sir - which restaurant?\" \"Five50.\" \"Yes sir, but which dining establishment?\" \"Er, Five50?\" \"[A slight undertone of frustration is sensed in the man's voice] Yes sir, but which of our restaurants are you inquiring about?\" \"Five50! The new pizza joint you guys opened a few months ago.\" \"[Sincere apologetic tone] Ohhh, I'm so sorry sir - of course, I'll look into that for you right away.\"  [Camera cuts to the man and our hero sitting opposite each other in front of a raging, elegant fireplace in matching burgundy leather armchairs, toasting glasses of finely aged scotch whiskey and laughing heartily as they reminsce about the good ol' days and that one time when the hero called to make a reservation. End scene.]  So I made that last part up but yeah, no reservation needed. ANYWHO.  Layout of the restaurant is cool, and the divider from the casino floor is made out of wooden blocks stacked on the ends of one another so not to fret, you can still peek through and people watch, i.e. dudes can still oogle at girls dressed to the nines (I myself wouldn't partake in such an activity as a gentleman but good info for the rest of you dogs out there - you get a pass since it's LV after all) ;) Plenty of space so you're not elbowing the table next to you.  Meatballs were really good and garnished with arugula and radish; tender and yummy. Calimari was okay...a little too much flour and fairly greasy. Real disappointment was the pizza; we got the Forager which had mushrooms, ricotta, brussel sprouts and something else but there was clearly a thick layer of oil on top of the cheese; don't think I've ever witnessed oil as a topping, even at fine pizza places such as Pizza Hut or Dominos. I mean, it was so bad the crust was almost translucent...that's just nasty and sloppy work imo. Speaking of the crust, it was baked too long so it was hard to bite into; maybe this place should consider a name change to Five00? I will say the pizza tasted excellent overall, a bit too cheesy and rich for me (lol @ diets), but the flavors were all present and intermingled well.  Service was good, though our server was an awkward little deer which was kinda cute and endearing - I'll chalk it up to Five50 being relatively new.  I'm definitely down to give it another whirl, but please, do something about the oil - think of the children! Price is fair for what you're getting, and c'mon, you're balling it up at a pizza joint in Vegas. Watch out Cosmo Secret Pizza, there's a new player in town. And other than the slightly confusing name, it could give you a run for your money and potentially be a future jackpot spot for pizza lovers.  Ended with so many gambling puns - what do I win?",

    "text": "The fiancee and I are big fans of Chef Shawn McClain's other Aria restaurant, Sage, having enjoyed memorable food and drink while there.  Given our past enjoyment of his cuisine, we decided to try his newly opened FIVE50 Pizza Bar.  Our decision was made even more palatable since we'd gotten coupons for a free slice and beer from MGM's myVegas game on Facebook.    We arrived around 6pm on a Wednesday night.  There was no line at the slice counter where pizza by the slice was sold.  We noted immediately that not all pizzas available in the sit down part of the restaurant were available by the slice.  No matter, since the Gotham ($5.50 per slice/$28 for a 16\" pie), a meat pizza topped with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano was what I wanted and it was on the abbreviated slice menu.  FIVE50's slices are taken from their 16\" pies, which are divided into 8 pieces, so slices received aren't very large.  Also, since they're pre-baked, there's no telling how long they've been sitting on the counter.  My slice was plucked off of the counter and slid into the wood-fired oven at what I'm assuming was 550 degrees to warm it up.  A few minutes later, I received my slice.  The crust was decently flavorful, crispy at the edges, but not necessarily chewy throughout.  I attribute most of the lackluster quality of the crust to the fact the pizza was pre-baked, had cooled down absorbing the grease from the relatively ample amount of meaty toppings, resulting in the crust becoming soggy and limp.  I was pretty unimpressed.  My fiancee didn't fare much better with her selection.        The beer selection at the slice counter was also abbreviated with only two beers available on tap and a handful of bottles.  It was also surprisingly unimpressive with only one of the beers available (a bottled Dogfish Head) sounding remotely interesting.  Unfortunately, they wanted $13 for it, which combined with the slice of the pizza, exceeded the value of the coupon.  I could've paid the difference, but as a matter of principle, I'd never pay $13 for a 12-ounce bottle of beer.  My parting thought was that FIVE550 may be a very good pizza joint with a solid craft beer selection.  Perhaps our luck would've been much better had we sat in the dining room, ordered a whole pizza, and tasted a freshly baked pie.  However, you won't get that experience by the slice at the walk up counter.  It's overpriced...expect to pay $16 for a beer and a slice, and it, sadly, underdelivers.",

    "text": "This review is for a recent sit-down meal (my first time at Five50).  Next time, I will try the pizza to go (which did look absolutely delicious.) My best friend and I wanted to grab a small bite and beer at Aria.  We decided upon Five50.  For starters, it took a solid 10 minutes just to seat us.  I figured the place was packed, but once we entered the dining area, over half the tables were empty.  Not gonna lie, I was slightly hungover from Saturday night escapades, and was particularly thirsty.  It took a SOLID 15 minutes (yes, I looked at my clock) for any server to even acknowledge us! Once we were finally acknowledged, it took another 5 minutes to bring over a carafe of water. I understand that there seemed to only be 3 servers...but again, the place was not that crowded.  The servers weren't in much of a rush either.  The food itself was very, very good, as was its presentation.  I got the mac & cheese and my friend got the wings.  If I were rating Five50 solely based on food, I'd give it 4 stars.  The service definitely merits no more than 2 stars though.  While our waitress was friendly, the lack of attention and length of time it took to get our water, food, or really to ask for anything additional that we needed was just way beyond what it should have been.  I'm patient when I need to be (place is packed, servers running around)...but this didn't merit much patience (not crowded, servers chatting it up instead of checking on their guests). As mentioned previously, I'll definitely give it another chance and try the pizza.  If I ever come back here for a sit-down meal though, I'll bring a bottle of water and anticipate delayed service.",

The service was very good.  The waiter and the guy helping him were very attentive and on top of things.  I ordered one of their special drinks - Well Suited.  It was a deliciously sweet drink.

It was very cheesy and tasty and the crust had good texture and flavor.  The oils from the pizza toppings mad it a little soft but that didn't bother me too much.

I love this place. Would recommend it to anyone wanting pizza or a quick bite. Would be 5 stars but the pizza options need to be better.",

    "text": "Stopped in for dinner on August 1, space at the bar and tables but they were doing a decent business because you can also buy pizza by the slice and it appeared you could get it for take out which was odd to see in a casino.   Anyway, they have a great beer selection, about 13 taps of all varieties, some national brands but a lot of regional beers.  The salads are good portion sizes but the thing that I really enjoyed was what they called Pigs & Truffles. This was a shredded pork cannelloni on top of spinach in bechamel sauce with some truffles on top.  The shredded pork in cannelloni was awesome, I love cannelloni but it usually comes with ground meats, not shredded. The pork wasn't dry at all and had a nice texture to it. The spinach had a bit of a peppery taste to it and it mixed very well with the creamy bechamel sauce.   The place has only been opened about two month and is buried back near the sports book at the aria but if you are there, give it a shot.",

For $20.13 I received an amuse bouche of super addictive cheesy, garlic bread, a cup of white bean soup, 2 margherita pizza slices and a vanilla ice cream sandwich with a shot of blood orange soda.  Everything was super delicious; the soup was nice and hearty (although I could've done without the dried herbs) and the pizza was super delicious. For dessert I expected a run-of-the-mill ice cream sandwich, what I got was a sandwich comprised of two galletes with vanilla ice cream, how cool is that? The blood orange soda is made in house and was amazing as well.   The service was great as well; our waitress told us a ittle about the chf and asked us where else we were going to go for RW. She recommended Sage, which I tried at RW when it opened and is mind-blowing.   In short, you must try their Restaurant Week menu, I dare say it's the best deal yet!",

    "text": "I am currently in Vegas and decided to try the new Five 50 Pizza Place at Aria that opened yesterday.  It was WAY overpriced and not worth it at all - the slices are TINY - and I mean TiNY (think of what a slice of quiche looks like) and True to the name of the place, each mini slice is $5.50!!! Two slices for $11.00 do not even equal one normal regular slice anywhere else. Last night all they had left was Margherita pizza (I was told it was a 40 minute wait if I wanted another kind!!!) so that is what I tried - it was just ok, certainly not worth $5.50.    For slightly more than the cost of two of these ridiculous slices, you can get an entire pie at Wolfgang Puck right next door at Crystals (yes, even to go, and without an insane 40 minute wait) and Wolfgang Margherita pizza blows the $5.50 slice right out of the water.  By the way, I am a native New Yorker and I know good pizza - while this pizza certainly isn't bad, I have had way better.  Two thumbs down with a recommendation to avoid.",

The restaurant did not carry the whiskey so our waitress went to ask her manager if my friend would be able to go get her drink from the casino and bring it in. Next thing we knew the waitress came back with the whiskey. She went outside the restaurant and tracked it down and only charged her $10 for it. Fabulous service for such a casual place. The pizza was delicious as well. Very rich and filling so I would definitely recommend sharing or just ordering a slice. I had the farmstead pizza and it was amazing. All very delicious and fresh ingredients. I will definitely be coming back for more.",

The pizzas here are priced in the high 20s and it is a 16 inch pizza which will definitely fill up 2 people with 3 large slices each. Getting one slice is not an option unless you take it to go. Note there are a few standing tables right outside for this purpose so if you don't want a sit down dinner, do that instead! Place is very cute, host staff was okay, waiter was so great (thanks  Wissam -shaved hair with goatee) now to the food. Got one pizza to share half Forager and half Truffle. Got the Forager with Mortadella instead of bacon and it was the most delicious thing ever! So juicy and yummy and so many mushrooms and the mortadella gave it a fresh kick and I'm in love! The truffle was a bit of a disappointment it was kind of dry didn't have many truffles and barely had any sauce all cheese. Another big issue I had... there was way too much oil/grease on both the pizzas. I soaked out the grease with four napkins and my hands were still drenched. Would come back though and would recommend - especially for some late night drunchies!",

McClain's creativity at this particular restaurant is a fresh and contemporary twist on foods that are very approachable, with many outside the box fun ideas as well.  I've had the pleasure of eating at all of his restaurants (Chicago and Vegas) over the years and he's really hitting his stride with a fun and totally new concept with this place.  The pizzas are amazing and not to be missed... but if you want, you could easily skip past them for some amazing other dishes at this place.  The beers on tap are different than most all places, and the bartender is quick to make a suggestion. The appetizers are amazing and different - I'd recommend ordering a few to get a try of the different fun things he has to offer.  The gotham or the blanca is my favorite... it would be impossible for me to make a choice between the two.  Overall, this place has a fun and casual feel but with an upscale elegance to it... it could easily be an appetizer & a quick drink type of place, or a slice to go.... but I would really recommend relaxing and having an interesting beer and a long night of fun tastes and fresh bold food.  You're going to want to go back the next day... I did.",

    "text": "Not your average Pizza place...  I see a lot of people complaining and criticizing on here about the $5.50 cost of a slice of Pizza and it's size. This isn't Domino's folks or little Caesars. It's an upscale pizza place by a well known experienced higher tier chef and the food shows!  We dined at Five 50 over the weekend and thought it was awesome. We weren't sure what a pizza place would be like coming from a chef of Shawn McClain's caliber but we weren't disappointed in the least. It was even nice seeing him there expediting all the dishes and adding the finishing touches!  Our server John expertly guided us first through the drink menu and then through the food. We ordered everything he suggested and couldn't have been more pleased. The truffle pizza was to die for. Yes it was pricey, but you are paying for high end ingredients and it shows. The pork belly Carpaccio was equally as impressive.  If you want a down and dirty cheap slice of pizza that's as big as your head and mediocre in taste this isn't the place. If you  want to enjoy a good slice of pizza or other dishes, made with high end, fresh ingredients... I say go, and go again... and if you are dining in definitely ask to be seated in John's section.. he is super knowledgeable about food and will direct you to exactly what you are craving!  We will definitely be back again (and again and again)",

First, we were served breadsticks and Artisan Sparkling Water.  Then I enjoyed the excellent appetizers and salads. The Grilled Garlic Sausage with white beans and fennel salad was my favorite and I also enjoyed the Arugula & Fennel salad. The Tomato Salad and Pork Porchetta were enjoyable too. Note: There were 3 adults a toddler and infant in our party, so we shared the tastes.  Our server, John, was professional, courteous and attended to our needs. I told him a type of beer I liked and I asked what he recommended. He said a Ballast Point on tap - smooth.  We ordered two pizzas, a Truffle Pizza (more than mushrooms) and a Margherita Pizza topped with basil (my favorite of the two). The pizza was not greasy like some fast food delivery places. It was crisp and fine.  Having something sweet to go with your pizza is a must.  I shared a Fried Zeppole with powdered lemon sugar and limoncello sabayon, and also the Milk-Chocolate-Lavender Custard dessert.  The architecture was fascinating: the cylindrical features, variety of materials, and choice of artwork. In different areas, you have black and white tiles, a dark wood, a long chalkboard (possibly 2) with menu items and drinks listed, light wood, a mesh of wood or metal.  We spent just under 90 minutes there. The All-Star Game was on the TV, but the TV wasn't \"in your face\" or the main focus of the restaurant.   After paying the bill, and was getting up, I asked our server about the different types of seating, just because I wanted to know.  There is a private table for a group of about 10, some booths like the one we sat in, table seating from semi-private to what I would call \"center of attention\", and bar seating which is well spaced.  As we were leaving, I saw the counter area and the ovens set at Five50 that's [550 degrees Fahrenheit].  I saw Shawn McClain and it was good to talk to him for a few seconds.  It's an excellent place to eat before an 8:00pm show, or any time for that matter.",

Our group of six got a farmstead pizza, a forager pizza, and an order of chicken wings. Wings were decent, although not very memorable. The forager had white sauce, mushrooms, bacon, whipped ricotta, and spinach. The farmstead consisted of proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm egg, and country olives. Both pizzas were pretty good and offered some unique, interesting flavor combinations. They were generous with the toppings although there was quite of bit of grease on them. Some of the slices had quite the soggy crust. At close to $30 per pizza, it's definitely not on the cheap side either. I'll probably try to find someplace else to eat next time I'm in the Aria.",

Very Large, almost too much... see, the pizza is very thin, which I don't mind, the sauce had a nice tang to it, which is much appreciated and the cheese was pretty good, but the weight of the cheese and sauce weighted down the pizza triangle about 2/3 of the way...to my liking, the crust should be able to stand up to the toppings... the crust however, had  a very nice crunch, and I usually don't eat the crust, but I made an exception on this one.  Service here is very strange, borderline bad, with pretty snobby staff. I inquired if our to-go pizza was ready to which they implied \"4 more minutes\"... so we waited by the little tables right there in plain view... few minutes go by, I see a pizza sitting there and ask if that was mine... \"oh, yes\" they say.  Wait, I said, you don't call them.... to which I quote \"no, not really.... sometimes the girls will\" .... so you know I'm right here... and you leave my pizza to get cold here on the counter?? ugh .. enough said.",

The pizza are throw into an oven to warm up or create your own. They also have sets to order from jn you want to dine in but late night crawlers can grab a slice by the entrance by 2:00am - they have slices of the set and picked through the glass. Located near the sports bar / poker room. Easily way to stag a slice a pizza and get back to what is more important in some cases.

The flavor of it was good, but it was pretty greasy. It almost felt like there was meat in the sauce or something and I'm a vegetarian. The garlic knots were hot and well flavored, but they were pretty expensive for what you got.   My husband ordered the Margherita pizza and he said it was standard. Nothing much to write home about but not bad. Unfortunately, the middle of the slices were very soggy and heavy and it was impossible to take the pizza out of the pan.   All in all I'd say that if you were watching sports at the Aria this place is okay, but if you want some really good pizza, go to the pizza place at New York New York or one of the Italian places at the Venetian.",

Another thing that's cool is they will heat the pizza by the slice in their oven for a minute to get it nice and hot again, I thought that was a nice touch.

The staff was friendly and courteous and our waiter was very knowledgeable.  Walking in, the restaurant has all the feel of a modern and upscale restaurant, but doesn't feel pretentious or stuffy (we dressed smart-casusal).  They actually have a to-go slice line near the entrance in case you need your late night fix or don't have time to sit down to eat.  The decor is very nice and the restaurant has a warm and inviting feeling thanks to the wood features and Edison lights.     We ordered drinks and the porchetta (grilled pork belly) and arugula & fennel salad.  the porchetta was absolutely delicious with a nice mix of salty/savory from the pork belly and tart/sweet from the apple.  The arugula & fennel salad was very tasty, tangy and fresh which provided a nice contrast to the porchetta.  For main courses we ordered three different pizzas, a Truffle, a Gotham and a Blanca.  I ordered the truffle and it was absolutely amazing.  I tried the Gotham and it was also very delicious.  I did not try the Blanca but my friends said that it was very delicious.  All things considered, the prices are very fair and it was well worth the experience.  I would recommend this place and we will go back next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "We decided to use our My Vegas rewards to cash in for the slice of pizza and a pint of beer at Five 50.  It's 10000 points which seemed like a decent price for lunch.  We arrived at 11am and went to the hostess stand for the restaurant and told her we were there for the My Vegas deal.  She said the restaurant was not open and to go to the walk up place.  We did.  The person there acted confused and started to say they weren't open, but of course, there were pizzas sitting there, so that made no sense.  She told us that the place where they get the beer is under construction so she had to go get the beers from the bar in the restaurant (like 20 feet away).  We're like, \"OK\".  Then she says you can have Bud LIght or 3-2-1.  So what we weren't sure about because she was not very clear and it was really loud in there from the overhead music was if we could only have Bud LIght or 3-2-1 because the regular beer thing was closed or if that is all you get on this deal.  Either way that sucked.  If you're using an offer like this to advertise your business, giving me shitty beer is a sure way to not impress me enough to come back.  Next, to the pizza.  There were four options.  I chose the mushroom and spinach with a white sauce and the husband had the many meats selection.  They stick the pieces into the over to heat them for a couple of minutes.  Then since we were told the restaurant was closed, we took our food to the sports book to eat at a table there.  The pizza was fine.  It's that thin crust type which is not my favorite.  The ingredients seemed good, but between the crap beer and the ok pizza and weird service, I have no desire to return.  Then we were checking out the restaurant hours and it said they opened at 11am... sooooo,  Okay then.  Whatever.  Flakey and meh food and drink in one of my least favorite casinos.  Probably will not be back. Can't recommend.",

    "text": "Finally pizza with something on top! There is this annoying trend in Vegas where pizzas end up with fewer and fewer items on top. Sure yes they all want to make \"real\" pizza but through all of this a lot of the fancier places have sort of lost the plot a little bit.   In the land where a $30 pizza serves one and has exactly five pieces of mushroom and a thin veil of cheese, 550 is a nice refreshing fun place to visit. The ambience is youthful and cheerful and the menu is quite creative with solid 16 inch pizza's being the focus. Our server was one of the coolest guys we met, super casual and friendly yet very attentive.   The Catania pizza was really good. It had chewy tasty cheese on a really well cooked non-greasy crust and perfectly cooked toppings. We had left overs we took back to the room and tried the following day and it still tasted just as good, goes to show the quality.  But then there is more. You have got to try the Floats here, especially spiked! The Creamsicle  float was simply stunning with Absolut Mandarin, and the most memorable drink we had in Vegas. Will be back for more for sure!",

    "text": "Walking through Aria, we saw numerous huge pizza boxes leaving Five50.  Upon further inspection, we determined that the menu looked pretty good, and that it looked like Neapolitan style pizza cooked in a pizza oven- our favourite!  We didn't make a reservation, and ended up waiting about 20 minutes before being seated.  Funny, because when we were seated, we found that probably 30% of the restaurant's tables were empty.  Maybe they were understaffed on this particular Saturday night?  The server we did have was extremely slow at everything from taking our order to bringing out our drinks and refilling our water, and then finally taking forever to bring our bill.  There were four of us, and we each had ceaser salads, and determined that we'd share the truffle and margherita pizzas.  The salads were great, no complaints there, as was the margherita pizza.  The truffle pizza was completely overwhelming, and I think it has put me off truffles for a little while!  Too much truffle!!  Ultimately, looking back on how much time we spent debating over which pizzas to choose, I think some of the choices were a little too \"out there\" and there seemed to be something on each one of them that one of our group couldn't handle.  Definitely wouldn't return to Five50, considering all of the other choices for food in Vegas.  To get more stars in Vegas I have to leave feeling not only satisfied, but like I'd return for another meal.",

    "text": "This place is probably 3.5 stars, but as Yelp doesn't allow that I rounded down to 3.  I had a slice of their mushroom pizza - which costs $5.50 hence the name of the place.  It was decent, slightly salty and plenty of mushrooms.  The crust was a bit chewy and thicker than I like.  The price was reasonable for the quality of food, but really if you want the best slice in Vegas then you have to find the \"secret\" pizza place in Cosmopolitan and have a slice of the white pizza - amazing!",

    "text": "I love any place that cooks pizza in a wood-fired oven, and these guys do it really well. The pizzas are expensive ($26 minimum) but they're enough for 2 hungry people (I guess that's subjective). I've only had their margherita pizza so far but I don't think I need to try another one because it hasn't let me down yet. The dough/crust is cooked well, and it never gets soggy. If I were to be really picky, I'd say that it could be a tiny bit more elastic and not so crispy, but I'm not going to complain about that because the pizza at midnight is so dang good. The cheese is great, they put a lot of basil on, and the tomato sauce is perfect for me. They take a while to get your order out but it is worth it every time.",

Two friends and I went a little overboard and also each got the Elvis milkshakes...  AND the Gotham to share... the milkshake was overflowing and we were properly stuffed.

In my experience, there's not many good places to eat on the strip where your bill will come to less than $100 for two.  My husband and I aren't big drinkers so we only had pizza but one pizza was enough to share (even more so if you're taking out since the takeout pizzas are bigger) and therefore our bill came to under $35 for a really tasty pizza.  Even if we'd added on a starter or some sides we still wouldn't have spent close to some of the other meals we had on the strip and the food would have been better.  If you want a low-key meal on the strip this a great place to try!",

Our appetizer of choice was the calamari which is just average. Let's be honest though, it's a pizza bar so would you really expect to have amazing calamari ?  We asked for a pizza to go (half pepperoni and half cheese) Aaron was gracious enough to leave it in the front so we can just grab the pizza and go. This place is definitely one of the better pizza places to eat at in Vegas.

Luckily my friend agreed and we had not gone to Aria yet during our trip, and Yelp directed us here.  Admist the casino and other dining options, located next door to the sports bar area, we were told it would be a 15 minute wait but then called immediately. Score!  We were seated and given drinks shortly after. We saw the table next to us of 3 young boys (10-12) given 3 large pizzas for the 3 of them! We were in shock as they annhilated all 3 pies! they all passed out right after, and it was fun free entertainment.  My friend and I shared their caeser salad, which was really good but glad we asked for the dressing on the side. If you're not a fan of anchovies, avoid this salad as it's really strong. They also provide a side of egg yolk for the dressing as well, but we didn't touch it.  We then asked if we could do a half and half pizza as I'm a white sauce fan, friend is not. The waitress warned us that it would turn pink in the middle and we were okay with that. When I ordered the forager (mushrooms, bacon, spinach) and my friend ordered the margherita, the waitress then told us the whole pink sauce again (within 30 seconds of telling us the first time) and again, we told her it was okay.  Pizza arrived not too long later, and can't go wrong with woodfired pizzas. Mine was slightly burnt around certain parts, but it was super tasty. Hit the spot. My friend's margherita was excellent as well. I couldn't even finish 2 of the 3 slices, so we took it to go and it was a great midnight snack. The pizza was around $26 which was not bad at all.  They also had a huge line for pizza slices to go (and table top seating) which is super smart for people who need a quick bite or craving after drinking.",

    "text": "\"Sex is kinda like pizza. When it's bad, it's still pretty good\"   - Stuart (Stephen Baldwin) from the movie \"Threesome\"  I originally came for the 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm and ended up with dinner.  The bar was packed when we rolled in at 5:20 but fortunately a couple of guys were leaving.   My wife and I probably wouldn't have come here had it not been for this phenomenal deal on brew.  The reviews have been mixed at best and since there are now some pretty legit spots for pizza in LV, I wasn't exactly rushing to try any of this at strip prices.    The only thing that was pretty consistent with all the reviews was how good the crust was.  If that's the star of the whole damn pie, I figured I would just be screwing it up by adding things like truffle, clams, rosemary or broccoli rabe.  We went with their margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella and basil) with extra cheese.  I definitely wasn't getting good value since all the other pizzas with toppings were only $1-$5 more but we did have 8 beers for 50 cents each so that justified my whole deal.    The sauce was sweeter than usual which surprised me upon first bite but it worked.  Cheese was cheese and basil was basil and that was all just a vehicle for the crust.  The crust was really good.  I like it a little well done and there was a good balance of chewy and crunchy.  See you sometime between 5 and 5:50!",

    "text": "This pizzeria has been open for about 2 months.  Decided to come here after much hype.  Good selection of beer--Intl & domestic--but not quite extensive as a Yardhouse...  Good wine options for a pizzeria, alas I don't drink wine with my pizza.  From 5 - 6pm, they have happy hour and offer 50 cents for a glass of selected draft beer.  The establishment picked up at 5pm....  My party opted to have an appetizer.  At the recommendation of the uber-friendly bartender, we ordered the wood-fired clams & linguica sausage.  Clams cooked in a buttery broth.  Came with bread with baked on tomato and cheese.  Load up sausage, onions, and potato on the bread.  This works well after finishing the clams.  For our pizza, we chose the Gotham.  Your traditional American pizza...  The crust was extra crispy and thin-thin--just the way I like it.  Given a choice, I would prefer the butteriness of JJ Dolan's crust though.  Generous cheese and zesty tomato sauce on the pizza.  Every trip to Vegas, I try a new pizza joint.  I have to rank Five50 my #3 pizza in Vegas after Secret Pizza and Project Pie.  I would rate here #4 if I could remember the name of a small mom & pop pizzeria next to a liquor store about a mile down the strip.  That pizza was superb with a crumby & crunchy crust.  But not to digress away from Five50, the pizza here is worth trying.  Is it a must-stop for vegas?  Not sure about that...",

I think it was olives in the mixture but the menu does not describe it properly. The bread was great but the sauce and meat was not good. The service was good and food came out pretty quick. Not sure if I would return bc those sandwiches left a very bad taste. I suggest you note it on the menu or have the server tell the customers.",

    "text": "Grub: I have to give 5 stars simply for the pizza, namely GOTHAM.  I have tried pizzas in different parts of the world from hole in the walls in NY to bistros in France.  But this pizza takes the cake or rather \"pie\".  Something about the chewy yet crispy thin-ish crust to the perfect balance of cheeses and finally the savory combination of meats.  If you want to get into the nitty-gritty it is = Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Grana Padano.  But you just have to try it to know how amazing it is really is.  Rarely do I have lose control and feel the urge to eat the entire pizza and there is rarely a left over slice. I also order the Arancini which is butternut risotto wrapped in cheese and deep fried then topped with marinara.  The hot chicken wings are great too!    This most recent visit, I ran into a familiar face (shout out to JOHN) who recognized me after over a year of not having the pleasure of eating here. I will definitely insist on having John as a server next time, he takes the dining experience here to new heights being attentive and friendly.  What more could you ask for.    Next time - I want to splurge on a Las Vegas root beer float, creamsicle, and/or a milk shake but only after a couple high intensity workouts........",

    "text": "This place made me feel like a second class citizen. I am so displeased with how poorly I was treated here. My experience starts out with me working a trade show at Aria and visiting Five50 Pizza Bar on my break. I approached the counter and ordered meatballs to go. When I asked if there was somewhere I could sit while I waited on my order Bonnie told me either at the bar next door or at the sports book. When I asked if I could just sit at the bar so I could be notified when my order was ready she proceeded to discourage me by letting me \"they probably wouldn't like that since you aren't getting anything.\" I responded that it only made sense for me to stay in the actual restaurant so when my food was ready I could take it and I moved to the bar to sit down.  I have worked in restaurants for seven years as a teenager and young adult. I used to Hostess do take out, run food and expedite tickets in the window all at the same time. While doing all that I was hospitable and welcoming. I could understand this response from Bonnie if I wasn't a patron but mind you I just spent $16 on food and tipped $3. I am a local foodie and Yelp Elite, I don't think I have ever left a 1 star review but after being treated so poorly I have to tell everyone I know not to visit the Five50 Pizza bar due to poor service and an overwhelming amount of options in Vegas. I would rather walk next door to Cosmo and go to the Secret Pizza shop because at least they are pleasant and welcoming folks. I work trade shows on a weekly basis around thousands of people and I even make reservations for my clients. This is one place I would tell everyone I interact with to avoid. The meatballs were mediocre and had OLIVES and chunks of mozzarella in them so hard pass at this point.",

    "text": "Great pizza, but not the complete deal.   Yes, the pizza was spectacular, but Five50 fails in every other aspect.  1. The dining room is clackity, awkward, loud, and very uncomfortable. Half tables/booths around the outer edge, and narrow deuces that are positioned at ass-level parallel to the bar stools. There's zero ambiance, which is disappointing because Aria has the loot to make this place ultra comfortable. The tables are wooden, kind of simplistically low-end IKEA, like something you'd find in a high school shop class. It's as if this place was designed by Spirit Airlines. The restaurant is a mutation of semicircles and odd turns that spills into the sports book, which itself has television screens that require persons to crane their necks upward like like newborn chicks hoping to receive some regurgitated nourishment from mama bird. What overpaid executive signed off on this design? Seriously, they need to be slapped. Our table rocked, which made it difficult to carry on a conversation.   2. Our server was severely oversaturated with customers. He took our order and we never saw him again because he was so busy. I don't blame him, I blame the management for their absence of situational awareness. Your boy is drowning, go save him. One CO can't guard every inmate in the prison. Before our pie arrived, we wanted to order drinks, but the poor guy didn't have time to offer. That was extremely disappointing because I believe the phrase is \"food AND beverage.\" Just to pay the check I had to wave my credit card in distress. Forget about asking someone to fix our rocking table, which actually is shame on the busser: you must have wiped down that table down 10 times last night and knew it was rocking but did nothing. Perhaps a career in politics awaits you: know the problem, feign concern, gesticulate in outrage, take no action, yet still take the money.   3. Tons and tons of open/empty space by the hostess podium yet no benches or seats to sit while waiting for 25 minutes for your table to become free, cleaned, and ignored of its rocking nature. And why don't they give the waiting customers pagers? Perhaps that's too much technology to expect in the year 2019 for a hotel that promotes itself as being on the cutting edge of technology. Things aren't well thought out here. Even the hostess's uniforms are incongruent with the rest of the staff's attire.   4. Stand-up tables? Really? I thought those went out in the 70's. Maybe in a cramped and cluttered space but the Aria's main floor is wide open.   5. On ALL the TVs was some kind of video shooting game with a perpetrator going house to house and gunning down targets. WHAT the F? Are you kidding me? Forget about such imagery being inappropriate for dining, what about what happened a mile away on 1 October of 2017 when Stephen Paddock gunned down 58 people and wounded 400 from his room at Mandalay Bar? Just 18 months ago. I cannot be the first person to object to this, nor see it as insanely inappropriate, and most of all, highly insensitive, and obtusely disrespectful.      6. Pie was the one of the best I've had, but pricey. So yes: two stars. Basically Five50 is like a half-built race car: great engine but its got no wheels, and even if it did the pit crew would ignore the alignment.",

Even though dinner was a few hours away \"hey, look...PIZZA!\" and I was off to secure a pie for some snacking in our suite.   I got two pizzas for takeaway to feed the hungry masses and even though it took a lot long than expected to come out...we got pizza.  The crust was a lot more burned than I usually prefer, even though I take the blame here and asked for \"a little well done.\" The pizza was a bit salty, even for sausage, onions, and peppers it had a very salty kick to it.  Our cheese on cheese on cheese pizza was good, also a little crusty but definitely pizza edible.   Server/hostess was nice...place wasn't too crowded on a Monday afternoon in the pre-holidays quiet season. Located in Aria btw in the far corner near the Burger Bar and the Poker Room.   As is everything in Vegas...it was pricey...very pricey. But you should expect that...it's a resort, not a pizza hut.",

Get there early because if there's a conference or if it's busy, you will wait! Luckily I was able to order early before the crowds. I ordered to-go and decided to take my food back to my room.  I ordered the arugula salad and a slice of pizza. This meal was about $15 (yup everything in LV is expensive!). The salad was good enough to share for 2 people, but I felt the salad was really dry. I should have asked for extra dressing. The dressing was already mixed in, but I barely tasted it. What I liked about the salad was that it was fresh and not much filler. I wish there was more cheese and croutons or something crunchy other than the radish tasting veggie that topped the salad.  For my pizza, I ordered the meat lovers. The slice was eh. Nothing special. I wish there was more sauce on the pizza. The slice was small and wasn't filling. Wish I was able to get this pizza fresh and out of the oven!",

Whatever you do, don't order room service Pizza because it's definitely not from here. You can see the difference from miles away. I needed a Pizza redemption since that room service Pizza.   Just by looking at it one can tell how good it is. I ordered a pepperoni and a cheese slice. I can't decide which I like the most. They're both cheese, not too much sauce which is great for me. Freshly made, as I was waiting in line I can see them cooking like 2 more pizzas in the oven. Saw a few kids eating here with their parents, it's a good option for families.   I will definitely be eating here on our next Vegas trip. Yummy!",

If we hadn't made a few other meal plans for our 2 day trip, I would have eaten in the restaurant because their garlic knots are the best I've ever had!

The pizza flavor was unique, and enjoyable, the dough definitely fresh. The only thing was the amount of oil running down the slice, and the ingredients kept slipping off, I had to use fork and knife. Also while the crust was cooked to perfection, I felt that it was very doughy in the center, I could not hold the pizza and eat it with my hands because it would flop.    $14 drink was in a small glass, and tasted watered down. Go for the beer instead.  Staff was amazing, as I believe all Aria staff are. Very attentive without hovering our table.",

    "text": "After walking around the strip late at night, we had the munchies and were thinking about ordering pizza to bring back to our room at the Aria. There were only about 3 different pizzas in their display window for reheating. We were going to create our own, but paying over $28 for a whole pizza didn't seem like it'd be worth it to me.  We ended up getting a slice of the Gotham which was huge and NY style, but way way too greasy!! They were generous w/ the toppings though, lots of pepperoni and sausages. Cheese was gooey which I loved. Unfortunately due to the amount of grease, the crust wasn't crunchy at all, but rather soggy. For about $5.50/slice I expected it to taste better.  I probably would come back to try their other slices or milkshakes. The milkshakes seemed worth it for the price!",

The only clams on the pizza were 1-2 still in the shell on each slice. You had to scrape them out yourself. I would rather eat my pizza rather than work for it. Furthermore, this resulted in very little crab meat on the pizza. Lastly, there were clam shells broken off and melted into the pizza. They were hard to see. Thus, there were 2-3 bites I literally has to spit out as I was chewing clam shells.   When I pointed this out to the waitress Amanda she said sorry and she would tell the chef. She even admitted that this was not the first time this has happened. Despite my complaint there was not an offer to deduct a portion of the bill or offer of free dessert or something to compensate.   Disappointing.",

    "text": "Given how popular Cosmo's not-so-secret Secret Pizza is for late night eats, I always wondered why more hotels didn't offer something similar.  Especially ARIA, given how far they are from just about everything else.  However, it looks like I wasn't the only one that wondered about that because helllooooo Five50 Pizza!  Located next to the sportsbook (taking over the old sports grill), Five50 is a trendy pizza joint with both a regular dining room and a to-go counter to get pizzas by the slice.  Both are open relatively late, though maybe not late enough for the post-clubbing crowd (the restaurant closes at midnight, the counter at 2:00am).  Still, they're great for midnight cravings, or people on the go like me.  Of the four types offered, I ordered the GOTHAM since it was simply my kind of pizza - Sausage, Pepperoni, Salami, Mozzarella, and Grana Podano.  Each bite was full of unhealthy, meaty goodness and I liked how the crust was thin, but not soggy.  At the same time, the flavors aren't exactly unique.  I've had others in the past that had more creative and compelling flavors, which brings me to the next point...  ...that as much as I liked the pizza, I'd rather spend the money on something I can't get elsewhere.  Yes, it's the Strip, but $6.50 a slice is nothing to scoff at (thank goodness for resort credit!).  Just getting a single slice might not be that bad, but it can get pricey if you're hungry.  If you're with friends, you might be better off splitting a pie ($20-$30) or simply dining in for the full menu (which looks pretty good, I might add).  While I would otherwise round up from THREE AND A HALF STARS based on taste, I'm rounding down only because of the price.  Five50 is nice addition to ARIA's collection of restaurants, and I wouldn't mind coming back to try the full menu, but I don't know if I would come back to grab just a slice unless I had resort credit or if I was in a pinch.",

Ricotta cheese is very expensive out here. So I can see why it's $9.  Blanca pizza came with fresh basil on top. Top notch high quality ingredients. Meats added are $4 each & veggies $2.

    "text": "We had a party of 8, it took us less than 10 minutes to be seated. The server we had was pretty cute and friendly. We ordered WAY too much food for out table. In total we ordered 4 whole pizzas (Gotham x2, North Beach, Farmstead, Forager,) . We should've asked our server to see if she'd think 4 was too much T.T We ate about 3/5 of all the pizzas we ordered. Had more than enough for breakfast tomorrow.  The Gotham was your typical meat lover's pizza. We all finished that first and pretty quickly also. You can never go wrong with meat over's pizza if you fancy protein and red meat.  The North Beach was really good. I wish I had more, but I was trying to avoid seafood thise weekend (allergies) The clan they put on top of each slice was bomb. Really isolated from the whole pizza itself so you can really taste it.  The Farmstead was my most disliked pizza. It had so many flavors going off at one time, but the salty flavor dominated everything. It was very distasteful to me. Of our 8 only 1 of us didn't mind it much. As you can guess, we had this the most of our leftovers. I tasted okay after being intoxicated, still tasted that salty sour taste though.  The Forager... I can't really remember this pizza well. I really liked the Gotham and North Beach, and the Farmstead ruined my appetite a bit. This wasn't that bad though. We barely had any left for this, probably like 1 or 2 slices. I do remember the yolk though. I tasted awkward at first, but then it tastes good afterwards.  I probably will not come here again though, just because there are so many restaurants in Vegas that i have tried before and this played didn't really 'wow' me. Probably because of that Farmstead... lol. Service was great. Watched a baseball game while waiting for our food. Lost a Parley. Ate some good pizzas, ate A bad pizza. Spent a good amount of dough for some dough.",

It's creamy, rich and you can absolutely smell and taste the truffles. The pork is tender and juicy. 5/5  Gotham Pizza: Sausage, pepperoni, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano. This was just alright...quite ordinary. Grana padano is cheaper than Parmigianno-Regiano and all the other ingredients aren't hard to find/ expensive so, I'm not sure why this is $28. 3.5/5  Truffle Pizza: Truffle salami, parmesan, bechamel, thyme, and shaved truffles. This was amazing! Fragrant, rich and truffly. 5/5  Their pizzas are 16\" from $26-29 (some are worth it, some are not - just read the ingredients and use your own judgment). The crust is fantastic, crisp and tasty. They also have pizza by the slice by the entrance. You can choose from 8 pizza options or create your own.

    "text": "When you find yourself in the more upscale casinos in Vegas, you'll often find yourself pressed to find affordable food. Secret Pizza in The Cosmpolitan is always a fan favorite, but sometimes you just want to try something out. Enter Five50.  I find the line in Secret Pizza always really intimidating when I'm just really hungry for a quick slice, and Five50, located in Aria, is a great alternative. Lines are never really long, and pizzas are just as great. What Secret Pizza lacks in variety, Five50 offers more unique flavors.  Still, I would say the price has something left to be desired. $5.50 is a bit hefty for a slice of pizza, and although it is a large slice, I can't say I was all too happy parting with my cash. Nonetheless, still a very solid pizza place, and it definitely is worth checking out, if you're ever sick of Secret Pizza and looking for a change of pace.  I would just raise one caveat though: beware of the soda prices. I was looking to grab a quick can of soda, and the price ended up being $10 for the combo of a slice and soda. Lo and behold, they charged $4.50 for a can of soda. Whereas I don't mind getting ripped off if offered in tap, it's nearly criminal to try to take that much from a can I can get from a grocery store. $2-$3? Sure. $4.50, please no.  TIP: Get your sodas elsewhere.",

It's a white sauce and has ricotta cheese. 2 slices of pizza was about $15. The slice was huge tho! It was so good!! I really liked that it was super cheesy. I also liked that it was a thin slice. So delicious. I would recommend going here especially after Jewel bc it's close and still inside Aria Resort.   It's a restaurant but you can also order and take it on the go.",

The dough was really good too because it was just the right balance of soft and hard. The pies were pricey but hey it's Vegas ... $60 for two margaritas. It was worth it though. I even went back the next day and got the choose three cheese platter. I got the buffalo mozzarella, sopressata, and prosciutto. It came with green olives, bread, some mustard dip, and honey. We also had the meatball sandwich. The bartender was very friendly and we enjoyed her conversation. I'm sorry I forgot her name ! She was so sweet and attentive. She was working yesterday around 3PM. I will definitely come back here next time I'm in town.",

They have slices and salads for take away but if you get a table you can enjoy more of what they have to offer. Some of the unique items include charcuterie, pork rinds, duck confit crostini, garlic knots, carpaccio and many more. The arancini is the bomb as well as the hummus and housemade meatballs.  For beverages look no further than the wide variety beer menu or some of their signature cocktails. Plenty of ciders, bourbons, wines and more to choose from.   They have a variety of pizza but I always seem to go for the Gotham: pepperoni, sausage, salami and mozzarella 5/5 delicious to the last bite. Other pizzas they have include the Forager, North Beach, Margarita, Farmstead, Truffle, Catina and the Picante, or you can simply build your own.  Tip: daily lunch specials available as well.  Tip 2: remember to show your M life card to get tier discounts!",

Yes, you now have to pay for the pleasure of parking at a casino to go and spend money. But, that's another story.   The interior is a funky, modern decor with a large bar in the middle. Servers are very friendly (ask for John!).   The menu is not huge; they have several pizza combinations or you can build your own. We recommend the Gotham which is a delightful combination of delicious meats and mozzarella on a zesty sauce and a crust that is the perfect blend of crunchy and chewy. Amazing!   Oh, and try the arancini as a starter. Crispy risotto balls that don't look like much but as wonderfully tasty.   A tiny drawback: it is not cheap. A soda will run you $5 though it is refillable. The Gotham is $35 for about 6 or 7 decently-sized slices. We were pretty hungry and shared it and finished the whole thing.   It may not be cheap and is a bit of a pain to get to, but Five Fifty is well worth it. Definitely the best pizza we have ever had.",

So we ended up at 50five. The pizza was decent, thin crispy crust but a tiny bit on the burnt side. And all the sauces were definitely on the saltier side. Truffle pizza was supposed to be the best thing on the menu and it was good, but I honestly can't even remember how it tasted and I just ate it 30 minutes ago.   Marisela was our server and she had a habit of walking away on a hurry before we had finished ordering, first with the drink order, then again with the food order. We had to ask twice for more olives for our bloody Mary. She came back saying they had no more, but when we tried to ask the busser, he managed scrounge up a few for us. We had to ask her multiple times for hot sauce as well, she kept forgetting so we asked the busser again.   They have a surprisingly good selection of whiskey here but the kicker that they don't tell you about is that they charge 4 dollars for an ice cube...   The pizza was decent, but the service kinda made this place average at best.",

The tomato sauce was very salty and the prosciutto only added to the saltiness.  The chef can definitely work on balancing the taste in their dishes.  Service was slow for a pizza place.  Music was incredibly loud to the point I couldn't even hear myself think.

They're not buffalo but they are sweet and somewhat spicy but so good! You can customize your pizza which is awesome. We got a pizza with garlic paste under the cheese, truffles on top and pepperchinis. The truffle on the pizza was amazing! The service is great, the waiter was very friendly and accommodating. We were also seated right away. Btw, you can't get a table if your only ordering a slice. You can only sit if your getting a full pizza.",

    "text": "Enjoyed lunch at Five50 Pizza Bar located inside the Aria Resort and Casino on Friday afternoon.  Upon entering the restaurant, the hostess promptly greeted us and brought us to our table.  The restaurant wasn't crazy busy, but had a decent amount of patrons, and was very lively.  I think it was around 12:30 or so.  We ordered  beers and the Forager pizza.  Since my husband loves pepperoni, we were able to add it at a small additional charge.  It was so good, and was served to us piping hot.  Just a side note, Five50 makes thin crust pizzas that are definitely enough for 2 to share.   The service is great, and the restaurant is impeccably clean.  It's a little on the pricey side for pizza, but I knew that walking in, and it's Vegas.  Plus, it's located in one of the nicest hotels on the strip. If you're looking for a delish pizza, and a great atmosphere, Five50 Pizza Bar is it!",

    "text": "We had 4 adults and my 6 year old nephew, so we asked for a table for 5, the hostess told us the only way to be seated was to be split into a party of 2 and 3, which would have been ok. But she sat us at a tiny table meant for 4 people. When we walked in they had a big empty table set up for 6 people that would have been perfect for us and a bunch of empty tables by the back wall. The hostess told us they were reserved. Well... we were here eating and hanging out for about 2 hours and those \"reserved\" tables never filled up. So that was a rocky start to our experience here.  The bus boy was very attentive and efficient. I wish I could say the same for our server, MARISELA. She was more than a bit rude, walking away from us while we were still ordering. We ordered one Bloody Mary, when she brought it, we asked for a few extra olives, to which she replied they were out of olives. So we ordered a second Bloody Mary and apparently the bartender there was able to locate more olives when they are out. We then asked her again for a few extra olives and she again told us they were completely out of olives. By this time we were convinced that they were actually not out of olives, but MARISELA  just didn't know where they were and didn't want to ask again , so we asked our bus boy who promptly brought us a skewer of extra olives.   We ordered an arugula salad and a Caesar salad. Both were good and refreshing. The pizzas were average to above average, however at a luxury property on the strip I kinda expect to be blown away. Nothing was really memorable except the bad service !",

    "text": "We chose to eat at this new restaurant a couple of days after it had been open. Before I get ahead of myself, I wish I could rate service, food, and value separately, alas, I can not.  Service 3 stars- our server was friendly and attentive, yet had very little food knowledge, and was slightly over bearing. Seriously dude, I know what kind of beer I like, although I appreciate your input, I chose it because I like it, not because \"you suggested it\". You want a gold star?  I get that it's a new restaurant too, but you should know what's in the food, especially since people could have allergies.  Food-3 stars. Overall the food was alright, but everything was severely under seasoned, with no salt and pepper shakers on the table. Call me meek, but this is a chef run restaurant and I was not about to ask for them. Warm ricotta was just that, warmed up cheese. No herbs, no salt, just some EVOO. Yawn. The calamari looked delicious, until you picked it up with your fork and bam! All the \"fritti\" falls off, leaving you with oily, naked squid. The truffle pizza was probably the best part, although those potatoes, like everything else, really needed to be seasoned.  Value 1 measly star-$22 for a cheese pizza, are you kidding me?  Even with strip pricing this is a little ridiculous. Our bill came out to be $90 for a snack, an app, a pizza, and a couple of beers. For that cost per person I could eat someplace a little less casual and a lot better tasting. Not to mention, you can get higher quality pizza right next door at Crystals for half the price with better flavor, more variety, and awesome service.  Was it worth trying out the new spot? Sure. But there are way better options within walking distance.",

The pizza is excellent and if you're familiar with Chef McClain's offerings you can be sure the ingredients are top notch. VERY important to me!  I'd recommend trying an appetizer or two which is what really separates this place from other pizza places. The garlic bread is heavenly and the meatballs allowed me the freedom to try the meatless Blanco pizza. And with a Shiner Black Lager in hand (on tap) I was thoroughly enjoying myself!  If you're in Vegas I wouldn't miss stopping by Five50. Just my 2 cents...",

    "text": "So much life in the city, you won't believe Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed Tell me what is the music, inside my head at...Five50 Pizza! - Chris Brown (don't wake me up)  I've stayed at the Aria for the past 3 or 4 trips since this place opened earlier in the summer and hadn't gotten a chance to try this place yet until now. After eating here, I kind of wish I was either drunk at the time or craving a quick bite or maybe buzzed or about to pass out from too much fun because the pizza was just not that good.  First off, the appetizer options on their lunch menu is almost non-existent. I saw maybe some garlic bread and salads and meat and cheeses but not even calamari or something interesting? Kind of a big deal, especially since these pizzas take a while to make. We ordered two pizzas, one with red sauce and one with white sauce. The cool thing is that they let you mix two different kinds of pizzas into one if they have the same sauce so we did just that. Half of one pizza had clams and the other was more of a meat pizza. The other one we tried was a white truffle pizza that had truffle salami and truffle shavings sprinkled throughout. Oh my....everything was so salty!! Not to mention that we couldn't eat half the crusts because they were burnt from the wood fire ovens. The portions were bigger than expected but since we don't like wasting food, it just made us eat more of these salt monsters.   When this place opened months ago in its infancy, the reviews were not very good at all. I was bummed until I saw that the reviews recently have been much more well received so I thought it was a soft opening type thing. NOPE!!! It's ok - I very rarely eat pizza in Vegas anyways but if someone were to ask me, I would say go to the Cosmo secret pizza place instead.  glass half full --- grab a slice that's already prepared with a beer and head over to the sportsbook right next door",

It was basically a pepperoni and sausage pizza.   - I'll give it 4-stars because it's inside the Aria, the food was good and service excellent, pricing fairly standard for a Strip eatery.

Nothing should ever close!  We perused the menu and didn't think it was worth sitting down in the restaurant when it was just the two of us so stood in the line for pizza by the slice.  We got one slice of all the pizzas available...so there was barely any pizza left after we finished.  We came during the rush so you would think they would be preparing more pizzas.    We noticed that the person who ordered before us had their pizza warmed up.  This was never offered to us.  The pizza slices aren't too expensive but for how greasy and bland the pizza is, I wouldn't have even paid the $6/slice and would have just starved until the morning and eaten at a buffet.  The white pizza was gross (cold, hard/flavorless cheese).  The slice with sausage and pizza was greasy.  The margherita pizza was completely forgettable.  Eating here just made me angry thinking about the other pizza option across the way...Accept no imitations.  There's only one True great pizza in Vegas.  And this place isn't it.",

We opted for just a slice each from the counter (options there are more limited than if you were to sit down and order a whole pie). The pizza smelled delicious and I was hungrily waiting for it to come out of the reheating oven.  I ordered the Gotham which consist of mozzarella cheese, grana padano and meats (sausage, salami and of course, pepperoni). The slice is pretty decent sized and thin in height but there was more than enough toppings for it. Unfortunately, it was sooo oily, too oily. I folded my slice to take a bite and quickly, drops of meat oil dripped down. I get it, it's the toppings fault for all that oiliness but that didn't make me want to get another one of those slices. I would maybe go back but for a different kind of slice.. like the truffle potato one or the forager. Fast, easy and affordable late night pizza is always a o k in my book.",

Our waitress literally behaved like she had everything in the world better to do than to help us out. When she took our order she was rude and impatient. I'm sincerely hoping she was having a bad day, (still gave her 20% of course). She did not check on us once, (mind you this was around 2 pm, not a lot of people). I really wanted pizza from seeing other yelp reviews so I asked her about the Forager pizza and she said \"oh don't get that, you can't have it to yourself it's way too big.\" Okay, fine, no slices. So I ordered a small salad and stood in the \"slice to go\" line and brought it back to my table. By the way, the lady working the slice counter could not have been sweeter! I'm left with a sour taste from the lack of menu variety as well as the icy treatment from our waitress. We will definitely find another pizza spot next time.",

    "text": "Stayed at the Aria for the weekend and after many meals in some of the higher end restaurants we decided to check out Five 50 for something a little cheaper and easier.  We went there on Sunday around noon to grab some lunch.  To start off, the girl at the register was extremely rude and seemed as though she just didn't want to be bothered.  We both got a couple of slices of the Mushroom Cheese pizza.  The girl pulled it out and didn't even bother to put it in the oven to warm it up so we assumed it must have been still hot already.  We also asked could we get it to go so that we could go back to our room and eat it and she just handed it to use on a couple of paper plates.  When I asked her could we get it in one of the boxes she looked annoyed and gave us one of the smaller boxes to stuff 4 giant pizza slices into.  Overall probably the worst customer experience I had at any of the restaurants in the Aria.  Now as for the food.  I was again disappointed.  I know it's pizza so I don't expect some high-end gourmet meal but this stuff was just bad.  It was cold, soaked in grease/oil, and almost rubbery tasting.  It's extremely heavy so I do not at all recommend this place if you care about your health.  This might rank among the worst pizza I've ever had and I've had a lot.    Overall I would highly recommend you stay away from this place. At least when it comes to the pizza they serve upfront.  Even the low end looking pizza restaurant across the street next to the Walgreens tasted better and that was surprising considering that Five 50 is inside the Aria with all those other quality restaurants.  A combination of bad service and bad food is never a good thing.  Not recommended.",

    "text": "Giving this one a 4.5 but rounding up to 5 because my biggest nit is with the desserts.   First, stay basic here. Work from the Margarita base and add pepperoni. Or build your own with cheese, pepperoni, and basil. I'd go with half the amount of cheese, by the way.  The crust is outstanding but I do not like that the cheese oil soaks through it so quickly. That's why I recommend that you go with half the cheese. It still tastes great but it preserves the crust. The crust, by the way, is very good.   The five50 chopped salad was OK. Nothing to write home about.   The desserts were disappointing. The ice cream sandwiches had potential but the ice cream simply has too much air stirred into it. It's not premium ice cream. A few other desserts were simply not noteworthy. I'd really avoid the desserts. Make your way over to the Aria and grab dessert from Jean Philippe Patisserie. Cannot lose there.   Still, the name of the game here is pizza. And Five50 does pizza well. Keep it simple and you'll be pleased with a five-star pizza.",

Really an eclectic take on a classic east coast pizza, done wood oven style with crispy crust. They also had a good selection of pricey but tasty tap beers.   Put aside for a minute that its rather expensive for pizza , a single pie is $25 to $30, and beers run $8-$9 cocktails $14, then again everything in Vegas seems to be pricey these days, this was easily the best pie I have had in LV to date. Cost knocks it down from 5 stars, and service was spotty at times, but certainly not terrible.   Recommended if you need either a quick slice or a whole pie, a single pizza would serve 3, and is plenty for 2. Recommended!",

The pictures gave me the impression that these would be the thin, crispy crust from the wood fire oven but not crispy at all.  Maybe because it was a personal sized, rather than the regular?  A bit disappointed but reasonably priced.",

    "text": "Hmm...not quite what what I was expecting.  We had a voucher for a free slice of pizza and a beer but the line for the pizza \"bar\" was long so we sat at a table. When we asked about the voucher, our waiter (in a rather irritable tone) said we could only redeem it at the bar. After walking off and coming back, he said he could deduct the price of the slice and beer from our bill at the end.  The garlic knots sounded good but instead of pretzel-like things or breadsticks like we thought, they were these little (and I empasize little) balls that were nothing but oil and grease.   The pizza was just average. Typical New York variety where you have to fold it like a taco or eat it with a fork.  Even with the voucher, the bill was almost $60.",

Every ingredient is carefully picked and often of the organic/sustainable variety.  The dishes are carefully thought-out, and pay close attention to flavor profiles and presentation.  The meat and cheese plate was fantastic, the polenta is an absolute must here, and the clams were just great.  Way better than expected beer and wine list too.  The servers know their stuff.  Foodies will love it here.  The price is right for what you get, which is a nice surprise too, considering I expected more of a Strip mark-up.

Not limp, but soggy wet as a dish towel, why is this so limp.   The \"Gotham\" tasted good, the crust was soggy.  The \"Forager\" tasted good, The cust was not as soggy as the following nightmarish Pizza but far from crisp.  The \"North Beach\" just was horrid. Clams were in the shell and just baked on top of the pizza? What did we miss here? Why include clams if the pizza could not absorb the flavor of the seafood? The Crust was a MESS! The Clam liquid obviously bubbled onto the pizza and just soaked the pizza. This was a complete FAIL!  The wings were meh, ok in a chain restaurant type of place.  The server, Aaron (I think was the name) was excellent. He was professional, helpful and the True bright spot of the experience.",

Excellent decor throughout from their tables, seating up to the lighting overhead.   Their selection of beer is outstanding, peruse for a while before making your selection or ask for a sample. We were here for an early dinner and ended up splitting the Caesar salad and their Truffle pizza. I can taste the truffle now...mmmmm. Handmade dough and crispy crust, fresh ingredients and don't skimp on the truffle. The servers were very friendly and casual. They have a few TVs throughout the place so you can catch a game if needed, but there is also a Sportsbook right next door.  They have about eight pre-made pizza selections but you can also create your own as needed. Lunch menu also included a couple sandwiches and pastas.  I definitely recommend for a casual but quality meal. They also have a to-go counter.",

We got appetizers of the fried calamari and the pigs and truffles, i didn't really like the calamari, it was just too much batter and hardly any actual squid.  I did like the pigs and truffles- the spinach was delicious underneath and the sauce they use just brought everything together really well.  Don't be fooled though because it's actually quite small, at least for $24  We ordered the Gotham and the Forager.  I was definitely a huge fan of the forager, the cheese was cooked to perfection, deliciousness in every bite, i did wish that they had a bit more of the mushroom though.   Gotham is definitely for the meatlovers, it's pretty good too but a bit greasy compared to the Forager, but both definitely worth trying.   I wouldn't suggest coming to this place EVERYTIME, but if you haven't been, i would say it's worth checking out. :)  Apparently they have a pretty good happy hour but I don't know the details for it since we went during dinner time.",

Every casino needs a good casual place or two to eat that isn't the coffee shop.  (No, Bellagio, Olives doesn't count...)  Anyway, all I can say is that this place is GREAT.  Now, we like a good straightforward cheese pizza, not all the bells and whistles, and theirs was honestly the best pizza either of us have had pretty much anywhere.  No lie.  This comes mostly from the crust which, on our pizza, was perfect.  Crisp on the bottom, yet still chewy, plenty of those great dough bubbles (you know what I'm talking about!), and really flavorful.  The sauce was delicious, not too spicy, not too sweet.  And the cheese was also perfectly flavorful, not super stringy like you get on a gimmicky cheap pizza, and not totally greasy like...well, like on Secret Pizza, a total grease bomb if you ask me.  We had salads, too, and my beet salad was great.  Something special, if you want to splurge (which we did).    The atmosphere was pleasant, no blasting music like you get in some Vegas restaurants now, and there were games going over the bar so it felt comfortable and casual.  The service, in our case, was prompt and pleasant.  So, yeah, all around, an emphatic five stars for a pizza place.  And I can't wait to go back.",

What caught our immediate attention was the bar was sans slot machine screens built into the bar so we could enjoy an actual dining/bar experience not gambling & dining/bar experience!   When we arrived we were the only ones at the bar but quickly realized this is not such a hidden undiscovered hole in the wall bar/restaurant....by 5:00p when Happy hour was in full swing and beer on tap was 50 cents a glass the bar was 2-3 deep.    What made it a very memorable experience was how well our drinks were made, the Blanca pizza was to die for and the friendly service.

The reason i'm giving it 3 stars is because the price was horrendous!!!!!! $48 & some change for a freakin pizza & wings!!! Yes the portion of the pizza was huge and they give you about 10 wings but seriously almost $50 bucks for 2 items!!!

It didn't help that we stayed at the Vdara and Five50 is located within Aria; but regardless, it was three damn times.  If you have been to Five50, you might can understand why. If you have not, let me explain. For one, there's a pizza entree called Gotham (comes with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padano) which is a must. Second, there's a pizza entree called Margherita (tomato, buffalo mozzarella, and basil) which is also a must. Out of the two pizzas that I just mentioned, Gotham is a must-must. It was so bad that when we came to Five50 for the third time, the waiter who we had previously looked at us and said, \"You're getting Gotham today, right?\"   \"You damn right.\"  Other than that, the atmosphere is laid back.",

It barely had any sauce on it. The best part of the pizza was the crust because it was thin and crispy. I dont think ill visit this place again.",

The pizza is excellent by any city's standards. Crisp crust with interesting mixes of cheese and toppings. The Forager with mushrooms (not button mushrooms) is my favorite. Good selection of craft beers and whiskeys at the bar. There is even a counter for Pizza to go.",

Two of us went for lunch, and sat down, ordered some drinks, and looked at the menu.  The hostess was nice and friendly, and offered some thoughts on food.  Then our server came.  I believe she smiled 1.5 times in our hour sitting.  A .5 when we sat down (it looked more like a grimace) and a HUGE smile when she brought our check and said I hope you enjoyed your meal (in other words, when tipping time came).  The rest of the time she was angry, or perhaps heartbroken, or suicidal, or I do not know what.  I understand bad days happen.  Everyone has them.  They are rough.  But don't look at your customers like you are annoyed you have them, or angry that they came in.  Especially when one is the nicest lady ever and friendly and cheerful and you just keep scowling at her.  It looks bad.    The pizza was enjoyable (a bit greasy, but hey, it is pizza).  The salad we split (which, regardless of what they say, is not that small a salad) was fresh tasting, and I enjoyed it very much.  The environment is nice, and it is an easy to find location.  Hopefully the service picks up.",

The hostess told us they had gluten free pasta, so we thought this would meet both of our needs. Sadly, it did not.   Things started to go bad when the server informed us they would not serve me pizza by the slice. What?  We came here because we saw the pizza slices our front. Nope. \"The chef has decided he won't serve you pizza by the slice.\"  Why not?  Well, it could be so that I would pay $40 for a whole pizza even though I only wanted one slice.  Also, \"the chef?\"  It's a pizza place. Pretentious much?  But the pasta was good, wasn't it?  Sadly, no. It was \"ok.\"    An arrogant chef, high prices and mediocre food do not make for a good experience. If you want great pizza, there are several outstanding choices in Las Vegas. This is not one of them",

I've had better pasta for sure, but it was decent for the night. I think the sauce didn't do it for me. The meatballs were the savior of the dish, I could definitely order more of those. Add 2 glasses of wine and the bill was $100 total. A little pricey for the food, but the atmosphere was nice.",

Just wasn't very good frankly. For a \"Pizza Bar\" that touts a James Beard award winning chef, how is your pizza not above average at a minimum?",

He did a great job.    The big disappointment was the garlic knots. This place has some nice ovens...and they deep friend the knots.  They were ok, but greasy. I'm sure they would have been a lot better in the oven.    The pizza was good!  It was a little underdone for my liking. Being from the New Haven area, I like a bit of crisp.  I was kind of surprised they cook the pizza at 550F.  That seems a bit low for a restaurant oven.  My wife's salad was very good.  Good selection of beer and wine. It's a bit spendy for what it is....but you're eating on the strip.",

    "text": "This review is for their take-out pizza only. You have the option to order a slice to go, a whole pizza/meal to go, or sit down and eat at their restaurant. We came around 11am on a Sunday, and were able to order a slice of pizza right away. It takes less than 5 minutes for them to reheat it in the oven for you, and we tried:  -Gotham (Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Granda Padano, $5.50/slice, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/five50-pizza-bar-las-vegas?select=hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q#hwQ-MReChXZc4K0EQBWN5Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/five...</a>): Really salty. I wish they did a plain sausage and cheese by the slice since it was the pepperoni and salami that were salty. I wouldn't get this combination again. -Forager (White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach): Sadly, this was bland, and I wouldn't get this again. -Special of the Day: BBQ Pulled Pork: This was the best out of the three pizzas. The bbq sauce was good, and the pulled pork tender. I would recommend this if they had it as a special again. -Vegas Root Beer Float (Vanilla Ice Cream, Caramel, Butterfinger Crumbles, Boylan's Root Beer, $9): Good, but you only get a small cup for the price. I don't think I would order it again for $9.  Overall, you can get decent pizza here for a quick meal, but it won't be that cheap. The crust is pretty thin at least, but I didn't like most of their pre-made combinations, so most likely won't return.",

    "text": "This review is simply for the take-out pizza experience -- and while, yes, that may seem ridiculous to give 5 stars --- it's ridiculous pizza! It's the kind of pizza that surprises you. You're not looking for much, maybe, as you pass by or running back to your sports betting table, or between dice rolls on the way back from the restroom. But that's the beauty of it...  My friends and I crave this pizza -- it's the first thing we all mention when talking about returning to Vegas (well, that and the craps tables at Bellagio). Whether at 2am after a long night of dancing, 11am while watching some sports betting next door, or 4pm after a long day at a pool party, the food is perfect.  Crust: Thin -- but not brittle. The crunchy/chewy balance is near perfect every time. They've got their science down. You won't have a soggy slice that drips all over you. It'll hold up without being too tough to bite into.  Toppings: All top quality. The italian cured pig varieties on the Gotham and spicy do not disappoint. The mushrooms on Forage are prime. The cheeses are rich.   Taste: Phenomenal. They don't over do it or try to make things too complicated. Even if you get the clam pizza, it's like PePe's -- basics but good. Like any good cooking. Quality ingredients well-done are the best.  Service: Always tends to be polite, efficient, and to the point. Heated-up slides taste great and only take 1-2 minutes to get right again.  Price: .... Five dollars and fifty cents. Very inexpensive. They're selling crap pizza all over Vegas with a Rolling Rock for $7.",

    "text": "I've had lunch here a number of times and dinner twice. All times were above adequate.   Sadly the parking on a Tuesday afternoon was rather challenging. It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave.  Now, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation). Met some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about 12:30 on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down. We thought about dessert, espresso what have you. Then we thought about our waitress. Thought it was better in just leaving sooner than later. The pizza wasn't fully cooked, underneath was more on the raw dough end and no brown on the bottom.  It had a nice taste, mushrooms and sausage. Who can honestly not have made a pizza correctly. They did- not cooking it fully.",

Once again super bad decision on our part. Super slow service, 20 minutes before we saw a server, put in a drink order, 30 minutes went by after we ordered our drinks never saw our server again, they didn't even offer water. I could understand if they were busy, but 1/10th of the tables were occupied.  We got up and left. The table next to us with a family of 6 also got up and left. Learned our lesson. They also have some strange rule that you can buy pizza by the slice at the register but can't order by the slice if you sit at a table. Considering the place was pretty much empty you would think they would like the business. After all even if you order by the slice you usually also order beverages.",

My friend and I needed somewhere casual to eat inside Aria and because this restaurant was listed as such, we thought that the prices would reflect that. I ordered a whole pizza at $28, but you can walk up and order by the slice for about $5 and change. The Forager Pizza consists of a white sauce and plenty of mozzarella topped with mushrooms, spinach, large pieces of ham and whipped ricotta. It had a balance of salty and sweet but the ham became overwhelming and it could have used a better ratio of veggies. My friend ordered the Spaghetti and added Housemade Meatballs. We both agreed that the spaghetti was tasty but the meatballs were off. The beer selection is fantastic, as is the decor. I just didn't feel that the food that we received exactly hit the mark or was worth the high price.",

Well, while it was ok, it wasn't the best compared to other places we ate.  First things came slowly and service was only ok.  We split a basic pizza, mushroom and peperoni; the flavor was great but the large slices and semi dried (over cooked maybe) peperoni cut the roof and other areas of my mouth.  I should have cut my slices but the dough was too tough and cutting was not an option unless I asked for a steak knife as I had already tried to cut the ends and gave up.  I love pizza but this just wasn't the best.",

When I went it was 312 Wheat Ale so it seems like they're not just pouring you ten ounces of coors light in a plastic cup.   - the pizza is actually pretty good. It is a thin, crunchy crust, so if you're not into NY/east coast style than no dice for you.   - beside the .50 beer, you will pay a lot for your beer and pizza.",

I'm not a fan of pizza, so a gourmet pizza place wouldn't seem to be the best option for me. Fortunately the offered things other than pizza. I ordered the meatball Parmesan sandwich and my wife ordered a salad with grilled chicken.   The meatballs had a nice taste to them, the bread was perfectly toasted and the cheese nicely melted. The sauce was a little on the sweet side, almost like a pizza sauce, but that didn't detract from the overall taste too much. The chicken on my wife's salad was perfectly cooked and the salad greens were fresh and crisp.  The waiter was very friendly and helped with menu selections. If the pizza is anywhere near as good as what we had, it is worth the trip for pizza as well.",

The salad with the figs and pomegranate seeds was quite good yet a bit small for the price. The pizza was decent but nothing to write home about at all. The crust was ok but quite tough to chew. I think the dough was a bit too dense/over-kneaded. The sauce was fine and the cheese was decent without being great. I enjoyed my time here and would give it a 3.5 if I could. I would say this is not a bad place to check out but there are so many other options and $26 for a margherita pizza is a bit on the silly side in terms of price (silly being a code word for ridiculous)- even in comparison to other Vega$ places.",

I even took my family to Naples's, Italy  this June to eat the best pizza in the world which by the way turned out to be the worst pizza we've ever had and the worst part of our trip. Anyway I've been staying at the Aria for several years now. So when they added a pizza place I was over joyed and hoping it would be good. The restaurant it self is very lively and well decorated. The wood fired ovens make a great back drop as you walk in. We were seated right away since it wasn't that busy yet. We ordered a Pepperoni pizza and Coke's. Yes Coke in Vegas again at a place that is dominated by Pepsi. That was one of our favorite things about this place. But the  pizza was seriously one of the best pizzas i had ever eaten. I only wish I hadn't eaten pizza the 3 days before so I could've went back again before we had to leave Vegas. Our waitress was also very good at her job. I can't wait to eat here again the next time I'm at the Aria. Like most of the places at the Aria it's not cheap but worth every cent. One large pizza easily fed my family of four. Believe me my kids can eat some food. Must visit if at the Aria.",

We arrived on a Sunday evening, did not see any patrons waiting to be seated, and asked the hostess for a table for two.  She quickly told us \"Sure, just wait a moment and I'll be right back to seat you.\" After waiting several minutes, we asked another hostess about our table.  She told us there was a 45 minute wait! Oh, really now? We then see the original girl who was supposed to seat us walk by, and asked her why we were being told there was a 45 minute wait when she already told us she would be seating us. To our complete shock, her response was \"I spoke to you guys before???\" Yes, she had spoken to us less than 10 minutes ago, and claimed to have no recollection of it. Her lame excuse was the restaurant being new and busy. It was not THAT busy; only one other table had arrived in the entire time we were waiting around. Regardless, you as a hostess would know that there is a 45 minute wait and have a responsibility to inform the customer of that. Not only had she wasted our time as we did not have 45 minutes to wait around to eat, she embarrassed us by making it seem as though we were not important enough for her to remember having met a few minutes prior. After explaining this to her, loudly enough for the entire staff to hear, all we got was a babbled apology from her and an offer to point us in the direction of another restaurant.  Sorry Aria, but we'll be dining elsewhere on the Strip until your staff learns how to properly treat their customers.",

If you're in Aria and like pizza, this is a great joint to hit up with a group and share a 16\" pizza. You can get it half-and-half to appease picky eaters :)  The North Beach is yummy (I love seafood haha)! Clams, smoked mozzarella, sweet onions, oregano. I don't think I've had a seafood pizza before this. The other half was the Picante -- ghost chili salami, shishito, calabrian chili, roasted sweet peppers. It was a bit too spicy for me, but it was really good too; I had to unwillingly hand over the other half of my slice to my friend. $28 + tip and tax for the full pizza isn't bad since the pizza feeds 4 people. Don't forget to grab a spiked shake! I ordered the Las Vegas Root Beer Float (vanilla ice cream, caramel Butterfinger crumbles, Boylan's root beer) -- it's kinda pricey at $9 + $6 for the Jagermeister, but hey, it's Vegas. I enjoyed my boozy lunch :)   This past trip, my friends and I just wanted a snack, so we took a look at the to-go display case. There are fewer options to choose from when you're getting a slice to-go, but oh well. Since it was the week of Thanksgiving, they had a turkey confit pizza! It was quite an interesting pizza -- turkey and cranberries with a white sauce.   Props to the executive chef, Shawn Mcclain. Oh yeah, the bonus? He was nominated for the James Beard Foundation's Best New Restaurant award for his new restaurant Spring, at the time.",

There is dining room seating until a certain time, but slices are available on weekends until 3am and everything looked as good as it tasted.  I went with the Gotham (pepperoni, salami, sausage) for my first slice with every intent to go back for a second.  However, the slice was big enough to fill me up and more than justify the $5.50 price.  It was hot, quick and served with a smile by a manager who said I came at the perfect time because lines form the closer it gets to 3am on nights like this.  There was a sports bar right next to it where I could sit down and order a drink while I enjoyed my slice.  Solid places like Five50 and Todd English PUB (especially with Courtney working the bar) and very easy access from the self parking garage make me very likely to return for more fun at Aria next month.",

We should have known from there the experience would be bad.   We sat down and were immediately rushed into ordering our food and drinks- after our drinks came, which were blah, our food  finally came. We ordered a traditional pepperoni pizza and a side of their so-called-famous meatballs.  The pizza was SO GREASY that the oil was literally dripping off the side of the pizza while it was sitting on the stand. When we picked up a slice it would fall apart bc it was so greasy.  The meatball was just ok. Nothing to write home about.   When our server came back to check on us we mentioned to her that the pizza was on the greasy side. She then said in a very rude tone that \"That is how it is and that is normal for ALL pizza\". I was offended with that remark. She has no idea what kind of pizza is normal if she thinks THAT was normal.   Any who, the manger came over and had a very similar attitude.   We paid our expensive tab and left- never to return, as I urge you to do the same.",

Also tried some of my other friend's chopped salad and it was so fresh, yummy and full of goodies that I couldn't stop eating it and it was big enough for 3 people to share.

    "text": "My hiking friends and I were watching one of the farewell shows of Zarkania at Aria and decided this spot to be our meeting point. It was a bit early for dinner (5:30pm) so we decided to have a quick snack before the show. Yelped the place beforehand which had mixed reviews but pretty much consistent good gourmet pizza though a bit pricey. (understandably being on the strip)  There were six of us but two didn't want to eat as they were at the buffet earlier. So we decided to share one 16 inch pizza - the Forager- between the four of us and a beer each for two people. Our waiter, who will remain nameless as we were so pissed off we forgot to get it, decided for us that one pizza was not enough. Motioning with his fingers how tiny slices we were gonna get. We looked at each other and I was like, I know how big a 16 inch pizza looks like! But my friend decided to order another pizza, I guess just to make the awkwardness less subtle. NOT!  Anyway, while waiting for our pizza, the next table's order arrived and I pointed to my friend how having 2 pizzas between the 4 of us would be waaayy too much considering we weren't that hungry and we'll be watching a show for a couple of hours with those pizzas sitting like rocks in our bellies... She got up and cancelled the other pizza. Our food arrived, had a slice each and two slices were left which we just picked on. The server gave us our check and we split the bill of $43. (For 1 pizza and 2 beers!!!) and left a 15% tip despite the lack luster service. We were already out of the restaurant when our waiter tapped us and showed the bill and said, \" Ladies, you forgot your bill.\" I was like, Seriously??? We left our cash payment on our table! Did you even check at all???!! I was mortified. The nerve!! And all he did was turn his back to us and walked back to the restaurant without a single word of apology.  NEVER again!!! No matter how good their pizza was,  not worth being treated the way we were treated. Management take heed!",

Especially the sauce. They should bottle and sell the sauce.  You might notice I didn't include the crust.  The crust was, well, crusty. And too much so. Maybe as an Italian I am just too picky about my pizza, but I like crust that you can fold in half, New York style. This crust was just hard and really distracted from what was otherwise an amazing slice of pizza.  Fix the crust and you have guaranteed 5-star pizza.  Service was also good and the pricing was good for being in a 5-star Vegas resort. I think it was $5.50 for a slice and it was a good sized slice.  Definitely going back next time I'm in the Aria.",

Service is frequently inattentive, they forget your drink order, leave you waiting so long it's awkward, etc. Quality of the food varies too. We recently got a salad that was mostly arugula stems with a pizza where they forgot the sauce and then added blobs of it after the pizza was cooked. The fact that anyone allowed that food to leave the kitchen is sad. We've been coming here for years and we're unlikely to return again.",

At least one guy was doing what I assume was \"vaping\" at their bar, as I don't think they're allowed to smoke in the restaurant proper, though I could be wrong.  The very decently sized (I'd call it a \"large\") Pepperoni Pizza was extremely oily and slightly too wet underneath, but was decent tasting.  The Meatballs were small and ridiculously overpriced for only getting three tiny ones and a few tiny plain crostini pieces that desperately needed a drizzle of olive oil.  Tiny portions at high prices were also seen with the admittedly yummy garlic cheese bread that was basically four half slices of an Italian loaf.  It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.  Refills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.  Service was pretty shaky.  The server forgot my shake, and then my shake did not arrive in its to-go container.  I also had to ask for our box of leftovers, which was apparently sitting in their kitchen.  The manager did bring them out and apologized.  I probably won't be back.",

    "text": "Came here a couple months ago with a group of 4 on a Saturday night. We arrived at 10:15pm and got seated immediately. The restaurant look about 60% occupied.  As we were seated our server introduced himself, a soft spoken guy, and was very knowledgeable of the menu and gave his honest opinion when making recommendations. He seemed like a nice guy but came off sounding very condescending at times. I really don't appreciate servers who stereotype their tables based on their age and attire. All we ordered were a round of water and didn't get any refills after our initial glasses!   To be honest, most of the staff was pretty soft spoken as well. I'm not sure if it was because of the intimate/luxury feel they were trying to give but all of the team members in the restaurant were very quiet and quite honestly not very helpful either.  Anyways, we ended up ordering the Gotham and Truffle pizza which were large 16\" pies. Both of which our server had recommended as being popular choices among guests.   The Gotham was basically a meat lovers wet dream, it was topped with pepperoni, salami, sausage, and a handful of other ingredients. Overall it wasn't bad, but tbh I can't say I fell in love with it either.  The Truffle pizza was a major disappointment. Beware when you order it, it was very oily and certainly takes a refined pallet to enjoy.  Overall, we were not very impressed by what this place had to offer. Five 50 seemed like a knockoff more expensive dining version of Secret Pizza at The Cosmopolitan and the service was not worth what we paid. It was certainly a 1 time experience.  The breakdown: (for the price)  Service: 2/5 Food Quality: 3/5 Atmosphere: 4/5  All 4 of us shared 2 large pizzas and it cost us $66.   Tip* You'll get more bang for your buck by going to secret pizza at The Cosmopolitan.",

The service was mediocre, but the small number of patrons in the main dining room made the experience more enjoyable. The pizza is pricey, but worth it - a must try. I do have to complain that the pie only comes in one size (16\"). For individual slices, you have to order at the general counter or at the bar.",

But if you are craving a slice, then this will do the job.    The Baked Penne was actually better than the pizza.  There was sausages, tomatoes, and cheese that complimented the penne nicely.  It had a good flavor.  We ordered a pizza and got 1/2 Gotham - Pepperoni, Sausage, Salami, Mozzarella, Grana Padano & 1/2 Forager - White Sauce, Mushrooms, Bacon, Whipped Ricotta, Spinach(meat pizza).  The gotham was pretty good.  The toppings had a nice flavor.  The crust could have been better.  The forager was ok.  The ricotta was nice but the rest of the pizza was on the bland side for me.  The shakes and ice cream floats here was wonderful!  We had the Black Cheery Float.  The soda was outstanding.  It also had small pieces of cherries that worked well with the Vanilla Ice Cream.",

    "text": "So I got the chance to check out Five50 yesterday with my cousins. Theres been a lot of advertising and hype around this \"pizza bar\" so I was surprised to see how slow it was on a Saturday night. They converted the sports book into this restaurant and like everything at Aria it looks great. Stylish modern interior, comfortable seating, and friendly staff all made it an enjoyable experience. As Chef Shawn McClain's new spot, I had high expectations. I mean he did beat a Iron Chef right?  We ordered the gotham and truffle pizza off their signature menu; like most pizzerias you can build your own as well. The 16 inch pizzas were thin and crispy and easily fed the four of us. Overall the pizza was good but not really worth the $30 they charge. I guess its not too bad considering that one pie can feed two people but I expected more for the price. You can probably get the same pizza at Grimadlis. In the end you are really just paying for the name and surroundings.  They have a pretty good draft and bottled beer selection. The 50 cent beer happy hour they have from 5-5:50pm is a damn good deal if you are lucky to enough to find a seat. As the 3-star rating suggests, Five50 is a fine pizza joint but there are just so many more worthy places on the strip",

It comes with pepperoni, sausage, salami, mozzarella, and grana padana.  It is a good pizza.  It has a relatively thin crust and the sauce has good flavor.  The toppings and cheese provide a good assortment of flavors.  Two people could likely split a pizza especially if you get a salad or appetizers.",

We asked in the beginning about separate checks and the response was MUCH ruder than necessary (the answer is no, btw, no separate checks; which is fine, but just say that, not a snarky remark). There was also lag time in getting certain orders. Our group asked multiple times about ONE order of garlic knots (which showed up after the pizza), someone got their shake 20 minutes after everyone else, and it took someone else 30 minutes to get their glass of wine. For what we paid, that's unacceptable.   They also asked if we were celebrating anything when I made the reservation (this was for a 30th birthday). This was not recognized at all.",

I will say, as I have in other reviews for Vegas establishments, it's VEGAS....things on the Strip are NOT cheap, so if you go expecting to spend very little money, you're going to be in for a rude awakening.  I'm only saying this because I frquently see reviews comment on how things are pricey in comparison to what you get/quality.    Second, this restaurant is located next to the sports bar so yes, you will should expect the atmosphere to be dominated by sports (not to mention that a lot of people do go to Vegas because of sports).  Now, the food.  The first night I ate here my friend and I shared the wings and a pizza and we each got a shake.  The wings were just okay, the pizza was good and the strawberry shake was Delish!   The second night I ate here I got the chooped salad, garlic knots and yes, you guessed it...a strawberry shake!   The next time I eat here I am going to try the Chef's Selection Charcuterie/Mozzarella....and of course, a strawberry shake!!  Nothing really stood out to me regarding service, which means that it was probably fine.  In general, the location is good, the ambiance is cool and I like that there's the option of grabbing a slice to go.  Will be back the next time I stay at Aria.",

Secret pizza still has the best while slice though. The \"secret\" to secret pizza\"s white slice is that the ricotta is seasoned. This makes all the difference. No other white slice we have encountered has done this and it makes.all.the difference.   The other offerings were just ok. The white after heated was.just a mess and did and was.very bland. The meat lowest was just ok. The issue was that all.the meats did.not have individual rates and just tasted a bit bland.   Reheating the slices usually makes a big difference to the taste an texture. For the pepperoni I felt it.did not improve the slice so I always got is not warmed.up up. I simple.love their pepperoni.  Ceasar salad was good. Each leaf is dressed with the dressing. Very fresh. Nice flavor. Real Ceasar dressing with anchovies which we could taste in the background.   The dough is excellent. Fermented for 2 days in the fridge. The sauce I was told was slightly sweet whixh is not exactly nyc traditional but boy it is tasty against the their dough..and cheese. They also Marinate their tomatoes in wine I.was told.   Service was 5/5 for take away. Food was 4/5.",

    "text": "I understand that your restaurant is 30 minutes from closing but that's no excuse to have a poor attitude when approached by a potential customer. We had arrived early to meet with a group of our friends after the WSOP to celebrate him winning. I wish we could have stoped them form coming because the poor attitude wasn't where this stoped.   For a restaurant in the Aria you would expect the hostess to be a little more professional instead she stood at the desk picking her teeth and playing with her hair leaning against the podium while we stood there waiting (literally, yes). I decided to ask if they had any gluten free options because I have an allergy. She stated they have Spaghetti that's gluten feee but it's a massive plate. Knowing I wasn't super hungry but didn't want to sit there not eating while everyone ate I opted to walk next door to grab food. By the time it was ready, our party had arrived, been seated and ordered. When I tried to walk in (food in bag, not eating it) she said she can't let me in. When I tried to explain I wouldn't eat it, she wouldn't let me in and rolled her eyes at me when I said I have an allergy and didn't want the pasta but I didn't need to eat it now, we just wanted to celebrate with our friends.   Threw away $25 worth of food to sit in their restaurant to have a pizza place not smell like a burger. Are you really that insecure about your venue that you can't let someone walk in with a bag and not eat?  Ourania, please at least learn some compassion and properly represent the restaurant you work for. I'm a local and I can tell you I will never be back.",

    "text": "Sadly, after a long day of flying we cancelled our anticipated dinner at Carbone and 'settled' for pizza at this Aria favorite. I've been a fan since it opened four or five years ago.   We opted this time for the meaty and cheesy Gotham pie. For about 28 bucks, this 16 inch six slice beauty was served piping hot, fed us till we were stuffed and gave us an early cold pizza breakfast treat this morningTheir crust is nicely charred and flavorful. I think the crust often makes the pizza and this one is primo.  It seems that wherever we go in Vegas, we order a Caesar Salad. And other than not offering anchovies (a preference of mine, but not Joleen): this one was fresh, had a nice tang and had some of the best croutons (their own). Excellent!  Five50 offers four or five pizzas by the slice but I think the value here is in the whole pie. 28 dollar pie about a 15 dollar salad and 10 buck blonde ale. Dinner, done!  Next meal...late lunch at Hell's Kitchen.",

I went in for dinner on Saturday night with a group of 7 people around 7PM, we were seated right away. The service wasn't the greatest we were forgotten most of the time and our waitress seemed to be in a rush although the place wasn't packed. We ordered a margarita, pepperoni, and a meat lovers pizza. To my surprise the  pizza was good, it was flavorful, light, priced well, and fed 7 people. The pies in my opinion could have been cooked a smidge longer, and the sauce was a tad on the sweeter side; my favorite pie out of the 3 was the margarita.   Overall, I was satisfied and would pop in again when I'm back in town.",

Five50 is located in the Aria and is in easy walking distance from the Vdara or Bellaggio. They are opened to 130 AM I believe which is great for late night when you're tired of walking around all day.   There where to groups of locals sitting next to us that let us try some of there different pizzas, very cool.  Service was quick for being a busy place. They have some great crafted beers and I think the food and drinks were reasonably priced.  We tried Evil Pie on Fremont also and they're good, but I personally like Five50 a little more.  Good place to visit if you're in the area.",

    "text": "I came here with some friends and since there were a lot of us out generous host had a set menu ready for us to indulge in only what could be described as an insane amount of food.   Right off the bat if you are throwing a party or have a large group, you might consider this venue an option. They have room, and seem to be pretty used to such things. So if you call ahead they can be sure to take care of you.  There were some highs and lows to the meal...   Highs:   - Meatballs (so I was told since I don't eat them) However I noticed out of all the plates people were gobbling them up the most.   - Hummus and Veggie plate: Pretty darn good. I wish that they had maybe picked the veggies or did something with them, but I am embarrassed by the amount of flatbread and hummus I ate. I swear if someone even LOOKED like they were going to get it away from me I would growl!   - Olives: Don't order these on a first date or with someone you are trying to impress, or even, act as if you are not a total animal. I always say, let them find that out later with a little time! heh  Lows:  - Cesar Salad: Just god awful. Right when we put it in our mouth we all knew something wasn't right. We didn't want to offend out host or anyone else at the table who may have enjoyed it. However, there were a few of us that sort of gave that wide eyed \"Ewww this is nassssssstyyyyyyyy\" look. Honestly, I am not sure what was off, like there was just this foreign sort of something that was not good.   Meh:  - Marg Pizza: I felt it wasn't truly a margarita pizza. I mean it was good, but had too much sauce and too much cheese with not enough basil flavor to really pass itself off as a margarita pizza. I mean, I love sauce and such and so the pizza was awesome. I just think that if you order a marg, then you probably want a traditional marg if that makes sense.  I didn't drink as this was my last day in Vegas before I drove back to SD. The water helped me stay alive though!   Over all I have TOTALLY had worse pizza in Vegas but I wouldn't make a huge special trip here unless I was hosting a little party and needed a place with a great set menu option with a TON of food.",

Five50 has a grab and go counter where pizza is sold by the slice and then a dining room for a sit down meal. We chose to go with sit down service.   The Mozzarella Bar immediately appealed to me so we started with that as an appetizer. The three of us shared Buffalo Mozzarella, Burrata, and Chorizo Rioja. Along with our selections were bread, a nice stone ground mustard, candied nuts, and pickled vegetables. Everything on the plate was delicious. The chorizo was tasty and obviously a nice quality meat. The Mozzarella was my favorite of the cheeses, but the Burrata was nice and creamy. My only suggestion might be more bread to go with all of the cheese and accompaniments.   The Gotham Pizza was delicious. The crust had a nice crisp and the crust was just thick enough to hold the meaty toppings. The cheese on the pizza had a nice flavor. We found the one pizza in addition to the starter was plenty of food for three to share. My uncle and my husband also ordered shakes that they seemed to enjoy.",

Still could not avoid paying almost a c-note for 3 people, even for pizza lunch. Fuck me sideways like the Luxor elevators man. I must say, pizza is terrific. Perfect sauce, crispy rustic crust not paper thin but not over thick either. Toppings lively and fresh; had pepperoni and shrooms, great shrooms. Cheese amount good to a little too much, its fine. 2 appetizers that grabbed my gastric attention were the calamari with shishito peppers (good but small portion not worth 20 bucks) and the house wings (very good and different sauce on them, like a bbq/classic buffalo hot sauce fusion). 1 pizza sets you back 25 to 30 bucks; 6 big slices will feed 2 good without need for appetizers, if your a normal couple. Really enjoyed this place. Has a cool looking bar as well, and by the slice available too ( if your into the sitting out/reheat thing).  Great pizza no doubt. Without question the most popular to go food as I saw countless freaks trek up to their rooms with box in hand.",

I loved the Strawberry Lime Cider over ice, kids both had huge shakes that could feed 2, calamari, risotto balls, and the Gotham pizza.   They also have happy hour specials and pizza by the slice up front. Plus if your staying at Aria you can call to get take out...

Solid craft beer line-ups on draft including local craft breweries and some out of state.  Their bottle craft beers are solid as well.  Nice ambiance, well lit, and upbeat.

    "text": "I'm absolutely shocked that this place has as good of ratings as it does. My boyfriend and I had seen the advertisements all over the Strip for this pizza place (they showcase their Margherita pizza on the ads- which is my very favorite) and he'd heard good things about it as well, so we thought we'd stop in for lunch. Boy, did we make an incredibly poor mistake.   First of all: the prices are absolutely insane for the quality of food. I know that it's Vegas, and that Aria is mediocre disguised as upscale, but come on. The Margherita pizza is a $28, and it definitely is big enough for two (I'll give it that), but when that pizza arrived at our table I was confused that our server had mixed our order up with another table. The Margherita is 100% just a cheese pizza with a few pathetic basil leaves on top, and you could tell just by one look at it. False advertisement, much? Granted, I'm somewhat of a pizza snob and I've had Margherita all over the world - I know a good, authentic one from a downright bad one. This disgusting cheese concoction definitely fell into the latter. I've truly had better pizza from Papa John's or Dominos - this was that bad. The cheese, which our server condescendingly proclaimed was \"PURE BUFFALO MOZZARELLA\" was absolutely NOT of high quality and was rubbery and gross.  Speaking of our server: a 20-something brunette, whose name I regret not remembering, was downright condescending and rude - I was literally appalled by her flippant and accusatory tone when we asked if we had the right pizza (because we were genuinely confused when it arrived). A simple request for a Coke ($5) and a side of Ranch ($2) genuinely seemed to put her out, the poor thing.   We spent $40 (without tip) on a terrible pizza, a coke and a side of ranch. There's a million and one overpriced places to eat on the Strip - save your time and energy and most DEFINITELY skip this one.",

    "text": "REAL RATING: 2.5 stars  I love Vegas. I also believe everyone else does too. You'll often meet people who say they're over it or hate it, however, I believe they're obsessed with it deep down inside. Vegas brings back a lot of great memories - birthdays, bachelor parties, weekend getaways with past girlfriends, taking a roadtrip out there with some of my closest friends, etc. It's one of the few standing places in the world where you can go and do, literally, whatever you want, whenever you want. I've grown to appreciate Vegas more and more with age.   However, one thing I don't like about Vegas is how much the restaurants located on The Strip rip you off - average food at a below average quality. Everybody, I introduce you to Five50 Pizza Bar.   This was my last meal in Vegas during my most recent trip. I was out there for CES (Consumer Electronics Show). A few of my buddies and I decided to have dinner here before my 8pm flight because we were all extremely hungover. Something carby, cheesy and greasy sounded good - PIZZA! Located on the casino floor of the beautiful Aria Hotel and Casino, I thought this place would really impress. However, like many of my Strip dining experiences, I was incredibly underwhelmed.   SHAVED PORK BELLY \"PORCHETTA\" ~ 4 stars ~ $15: Shaved apples, apple butter and celery sitting on top of a thin bed of shaved pork belly. To be honest, the first bite didn't impress me. In fact, I thought it was very bad. However, my friend convinced me to try another bite, which I did. It actually turned out to get better as I was eating it. The reason is because my first bite was dominated by apple flavors with hints of saltiness from the pork. But after another bite, my taste buds settled down the apple taste and the pork belly took over. I recommend this dish as a starter.   FARMSTEAD PIZZA ~ 2 stars ~ $25: Proscuitto, creme fraiche, farm eggs and country olives. Look, if you're going to charge 25 bucks for, essentially, a medium sized pizza with only six slices, it better be awesome. Where Five50 falls flat on their face is their crust. They claim they're a spin on East Coast style pizza, but it's so far from that. The crust was flimsy and doughy. Another thing that sucked? It was WAY to salty. Proscuitto, olives and cheese? Yeah, it was a sodium bomb! The eggs were runny but damn was it salty! I must have downed three glasses of water with each slice. I had to eat it though. My body was in dire need of food.   The worst part about Five50 was the service. This is a little surprising considering they market themselves as an upscale pizza joint in the middle of a high-end casino and resort. Our server would literally drop our plates and flatware on the table, not gently place them in front of us. He was spilling everywhere when pouring our water. What pissed me off the most is that he didn't even apologize for anything. He wasn't cool. In fact, he was a total douche. I hope he chokes on something (it's Monday, I'm kind of in a foul mood. You gotta excuse me.).",

Originally, I had thought about Secret Pizza at the Cosmopolitan, but with the prospect of a potential long wait and no designated seating area, it didn't seem like a good idea.   My friend D suggested Five50 as she'd been here before.   Unfortunately, this became another case of bad service. When we arrived, we were told it would be a 15-20 minute wait--no problem. But when we were called, our table wasn't actually ready, the bus boys were nowhere to be found, and our hostess was frantically trying to clean the table.   We sat down, and a few minutes later, a large party was seated next to us. We still hadn't been greeted. The large party had their order taken first. I was ready to cry... I was famished and I wondered what it would take to get some pizza.   Finally our order was taken,  but everything took forever... Getting drinks, etc.  we needed a second pizza (I was starving!!!!) and it took a whole again to flag someone down to order more food.   The pizza was quite good. We had the Margharita pizza and it hada nice light crispy crust , the right amount of lovely tomato sauce, and great mozzarella and fresh basil.   Who knows? Off night? The pizza is good, but the service was not on point when we were there.",

    "text": "It's a shame. A crying shame. How do you mess up pizza? Clever name, Five50 (the temp of the oven) and the name Shawn McClain attached to this, how can this be so bad? I thought Sage was terribly overrated, but I had high hopes for Five50.   We started out with a couple apps, sampled four different pies (which we we able to do halves on) and finished with a few desserts.  Small Plates:  Pepperoni Arancini- Rice Balls, Red Sauce and Roasted Garlic Aioli. $12. Three small arancinis, they were pretty good.  Pigs and Truffles- Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel and Summer Truffles. $18.  I'm a sucker for bechamel. That intrigued me more than the truffles. This was pretty outstanding.  Signature Pizzas are 16\".   North Beach- Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions, Oregano. By far one of the weirdest tasting pizzas I've ever had. I think what threw me off the most was the sauce. I'm used to a clam pizza with a white sauce. The red sauce did not pair well, even worse was the smoked mozzarella. I felt like I was eating BBQ. It was terrible.  Blanca- Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Chedder, Olive Oil, Garlic, Basil. This was decent, the ricotta was the best part.   Truffle- Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme, Shaved Truffles. Would you like a side of oil to go with that? Wow, only thing I saw on this pizza was oil. Someone call  the nearest Cath Lab and book a room for me? I couldn't finish my slice, it was terribly overwhelming.   Margherita- Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella and Basil. This was pretty standard. Nothing to write home about.   At $28 a pizza, you walk away thinking, \"did that really just happen?\"   Desserts:  Warm Apple Pie & French Toast Cubes. Both made up for the horendous pizza.  Skip this place.",

    "text": "Another high dollar pizza joint in Vegas...  We started off with the Pepperoni Arancini ($8). These were pretty tasty, but most of the flavor was in the Garlic Aioli...yum!  Good portion size / price ratio.  Pigs & Truffles ($18): Pork Shoulder Cannelloni, Bordeaux Spinach, Bechamel & Summer Truffles. This was delicious but felt a bit spendy. It had a wonderful truffle essence from the fragrant smell to the taste!  I probably wouldn't order this again though.  We got two pizzas...both SPLIT into halves.  So we were able to try a total of FOUR different pizzas :  Truffle Pizza ($29): Truffle Salami, Bechamel, Parmesan, Thyme & Shaved Truffles. Blanca ($27): Mozzarella, Ricotta, Bel Paese, White Cheddar, Olice Oil, Garlic & Basil. Both were excellent, but the Truffle Salami with shaved Truffles was outstanding! Loved the flavor explosions here!! Highly recommended!  Margherita ($24): Tomato, Buffalo Mozzarella & Basil. North Beach ($28): Clams, Smoked Mozzarella, Sweet Onions & Oregano. The Margherita was good, bit sweet with a nice mozzarella flavor. The North Beach was surprisingly smokey in a red sauce, which was an odd combination in my eyes...I would have much preferred a white sauce for the clams.  I can't really recommend either of these.  And to finish, we tried the Warm Apple Pie ($9?): White Cheddar, Oatmeal Streusel & Smoke Salted Mascarpone Ice Cream. Good variation of the classic.   Crispy Sourdough Fritters ($9?): Winter Spiced Cranberry Sauce & Orange Glaze. These were great, but the cranberry sauce was perfect! Just the right amount of tanginess to compliment the fried sourdough.  Recommended :)  Will I be back?  Yes, but not anytime soon I don't believe...",

    "text": "First time eating here. We arrived around 2pm, and were seated immediately. Our server, who was pleasant enough but whose name escapes me, took our orders quickly and brought our drinks right away.  We ordered the Gotham pizza to share, which was, as we Italians say, \"mezza-mezza\". It tasted great, fresh meat toppings and perfectly cheesed, but the crust was not consistent in thickness. Some slices were evenly thin-crusted from the center to the edges, and some were thick at the edges (the way I'm used to being from NY) but so paper thin at the middle that the toppings and oil soaked through and it all fell apart.  I'm by no means cheap, and I certainly understand \"strip pricing\" in Vegas, especially since I work in the same hotel that this place resides, but the pizza carried a $28 price tag for 6 slices, plus $4.50 each for a 6\" tall x 2\" diameter glass of iced tea that was almost  1/2 full of crushed ice, and I can't help but feel that I could have put that $40 to better use elsewhere for lunch. Also a disappointment (which won't apply to most people but I'll mention it anyway) was the fact that they don't honor any sort of employee discount, making this the first place I've personally been to in the MGM lineup that has stiffed me on my employee ID. Boo for that. All things considered I'd give the experience a 6/10, and I think this will likely be my last time there.",

We were pressed for time and had a 30 to 40 minute window for eating. The service was accommodating, and they got us in and out just in time. We ordered one pizza, half North Beach half Margherita. The slices were large and thin, so one pizza was enough to make two people full at three slices per person. The pizza was thin crust, but still had a slight chew to go with the crunch which I enjoyed. The North Beach had smoked mozzarella and clams on it, and was described as bbq chicken pizza with the chicken swapped for clams. It was unique with tender clam pieces, but I think they planted a dangerous seed since I found myself wishing it had a dash of bbq sauce! The Margherita pizza was nothing special, just a big basil leaf on each slice.",

    "text": "For those of you who have been to aria, you know it's a rather upscale ritzy place. Not really the type of place you'd imagine a pizza by the slice bar, right? Enter Five50....a sit down Italian restaurant serving artisan specialty pizza as well as the typical overpriced dishes and a huge selection of craft beer. Sit down with a group and expect your tab to be in the high hundreds.   Then, aria decided to try to be like the cosmo (in my opinion) and added the \"to go\" line that sells slices of pizza. (no, you cannot get a single slice when you sit down inside) there are 3 or 4 types to choose from... Cheese, a meat slice, a veggie slice, and a rotating seasonal slice. I've had all of them. I find the pizza here to be very artisinal, If that makes sense. The crust is more of the wood fire baked pizza or stone fired pizza etc. It's chewy and yeasty and quite good, especially if you're into that type of thing.  All slices are just under $6 with tax and all of them are good. The tomato sauce is A1...i was thinking in my head that the pizza was a 3/5 but then the sauce really just pushes it to a 4..its probably the best pizza sauce ive had. Not overly sweet, with a nice zest to it and it complements the crust perfectly.   The overall atmosphere here is kind of weird.. Like I can't walk up and get a slice and feel normal walking through the casino with this pizza. It's right next to the sports bar and right across from the high limit slots...strange. However, I think aria did a nice job of trying to combine their atmosphere with a place for guests to get drunk quick food without leaving their property. It's not my #1 choice, but it's 2nd and it's still solid.",

We were going for a later meal, wanted something casual that wasn't a buffet and one of the casino employees mentioned this place had good pizza so the other non-New Yorkers were lured in (as someone who has had fantastic pizza here in NYC and Chicago I was skeptical).  We were promptly seated (for a party of 8 we had our own private dining area), and our waitress was very prompt and attentive to our table.  They have a small menu, but it catered to our different dietary restrictions (some were doing a Paeleo diet, some were doing low carb, some were vegetarian... it's hard to please 8 women sometimes!).  I ended up getting the sausage and peppers sandwich, the well suited, and a few of us tried the margharetia pizza .   The drink was nice and strong, and was the best part of my meal.  The sausage and peppers sandwich was flavorful, though the amount of bread was overwhelming to the amount of sausage and pepers within the sandwich so it was mostly bread.  The pizza, though we requested it be cut in 8 (usually their pies are cut in 6), was cut oddly so it wasn't an equitable division of pizza amongst our party (so we ended up cutting some slices in half), however the taste was bland and the crust though well done on the edges, could have been cooked a bit more and tasted a bit raw.  So for a quick casual bite I would say ok, however this wouldn't rank very highly in my list of places to eat while in Vegas.",

Well anyway, things started off good. We ordered the garlic knots and meatballs. Garlic knots were good and the meatballs were overwhelming (too many spices). We decided to go with 2 different pizzas (1 per couple Margherita and Gotham)  1. Margherita had too much sauce and just oily. I mean it's pretty hard to mess up a Margherita pizza.  2. The Gotham was tastier but sooooo oily.  3. Elvis Milkshake was amazing according to my husband.  3. Our waiter was just rude. Very cocky and not very attentive. Maybe his tight ass jeans and hipster glasses only made him seem  older than he already was or they were cutting off the circulation...Either way his attitude needed work.   All in all not worth spending $28 for a pizza that was greasy and bleh. Secret Pizza Place in Cosmo next time. Although it doesn't seem like much of a secret anymore.",

    "text": "A year later and we had a nice pizza lunch at Five50. Service was quick and attentive. Water glasses were promptly filled and everything was great... except,  the same issue with the pizza centers being thinner than the rest of the pizza where it even caused one piece that was being pulled from the pizza pan to leave the 'tip' of the slice behind. Pizza flavors were great and being the creatures of habit that we are, we still got the margherita and the Gotham pizza. We got the chef's choice charcuterie board. The Humboldt Fog goat cheese spread so smoothly like a soft cream cheese over the crostini to make a perfect little spot for the cured meats. I better stop, I want more. Found out, by the way, the cheese is at Whole Foods. First stop when I get home.",

What a pleasant surprise for my taste buds!  My friend ordered the meatball sandwich and I ordered the eggplant sandwich and we both shared a salad since the sandwiches didn't come with sides and we thought we would need more food.  WRONG!  Our meals would have been plenty!  Both sandwiches were stupendous.  Full of flavor and textures and cooked to perfection...and OH those meatballs!!  The salad was a nice addition but overall it was far too much food for us to finish.  We were so stuffed that we weren't able to partake in what looked like some fabulous classic milk shakes!  Overall I was VERY pleased and next time I stay at Aria will come back for the wood-fired pizza!!  GOOD STUFF!  OH....and our server was excellent!  Very attentive and a great personality to boot!",

The other reviews that said you can order slices... for clarification, thats's for 'to go' only not dine in. There are a few stand up tables nearby where folks were enjoying their slice. For two of us dining in, we shared a chopped salad (about $14) and a pizza (1/2 & 1/2 for us each to pick our favorite toppings). The salad was good, fresh, and satisfying. Not huge, and not a lot of the salami and other things, mostly lettuce. The pizza, mmmm... as others were being delivered around us, we could hardly wait for ours to arrive. It didn't take too long and bam, great pizza arrived looking and smelling great. It had a nice crisp crust, and just the right amount of sauce, cheese, and toppings. The mushroom pizza was great - creaming and cheesy. The meat lovers (name I can't recall) was the perfect version of itself. For a casual meal in a hotel, the ambiance was great, felt like a nice local brewpub with pizza. The price for 2 beers, a pizza and salad came to about $70, so not cheap, however very good.",

It was a generous slice that was definitely big enough to be a meal.  My friend came back later in the day and got the blanca slice.  Each slice was appropriately $5.50, $5.95 with tax.  I'd highly recommend it!  Yummm!",

Do yourself a favor and get the truffle pizza without the potatoes, and have them add on some of their jalapenos. They get the jalapenos fresh and pickle them. They complement the richness of the pizza quite well. Don't forget to start with their chicken wings accompanied by their homemade bleu cheese dressing. Also, the Five50 chopped salad is a must. Its like antipasti meets salad in a bowl and throws a party. It has so many textures and flavors, and the vinaigrette on the salad keeps you salivating for more. Do yourself another favor and wash it down with a pint or two of their seasonal Citradelic Tangerine IPA made by New Belgium that they have on draft.It is quite evident with even just a small sampling of their food that this is a chef driven restaurant with solid grub and a beer selection to top it off.",

Where do I even begin about the tacky and unhelpful staff?! We stopped by here to grab a quick bite before heading to our room after check in. The cashier was unbelievably rude and gross! We had a resort credit of $100 to use on charges in the casino, which was given to us by Aria. When we went to pay for our order and informed her of wanting to charge the order to our room, she said we were blocked and unable to make room charges. Directing me to take it up with the front desk while eye screwing my husband, instead of checking into the issue by calling the front desk, which the front desk at aria informed me was all she had to do.  My husband was disgusted that this girl with piercings and a 90's skater girl/punk look was hitting on him. Just a tip for their cashier staff, hitting on customers while you are a cashier at a pizza place is probably not going to work in your favor honey. Gross and embarrassing!  1 star is given for her efforts in trying to flirt with a married man in front of his wife. Pathetic!",

    "text": "12/15/2014   This pizza place is superb and by Vegas casino standards, inexpensive. Massive slices of delicious pizza at $5.50 a slice or you can order  lunch or dinner pizza/pasta/salads etc. Located in the Aria hotel on the casino level between the poker room and sports book it gets really busy so try and go at off times. The service is also fantastic as they go out of their way to accommodate any and all special requests. Although  the pasta and meatball entree is  incredibly enticing, in the end I personally love the five cheese pizza (it's a little greasy, but every great pizza has to have some grease). Clearly the high quality of all the ingredients coupled with the proper care in preparing their menu makes the difference. Turns out Five50 is operated by well know chef Shawn McClain (Sage restaurant among others), who I had the pleasure of meeting when he was actually working behind the bar in the restaurant one night. Nice guy, but more importantly- great pizza! Here is a tip: their desserts are also incredible, in fact on my bday they treated me to this delicious milk shake type creation  -fantastic! Kudos to the GM and all the staff at Five50 - thanks for making it my go to restaurant in Vegas",
