The lunch buffet is a great deal, look for the coupons that float around in local mags, we've gotten ours from the 89012 mag.  * Lunch Buffet - 11.00 a.m. - 3.00 p.m. * Dinner - 5.00 p.m. - 10.30 p.m.  * Special Buffet Prices - Monday to Sunday: $10.95 / person  The staff is, as they say from their website, \"Guest is as good as God\" ...well, I wouldn't go thaaaaaaaat far, but they've ALWAYS been incredibly friendly, attentive and happy to see me (I'm their golden goose). It's not cheap, so don't roll in expecting $10/person.  Being a vegetarian, (which Indian culuture is as well) they have an excellent selection of lentils and meat-less dishes, my favorite, the Yellow Dal, a sh*t ton of Naan and a side of tamrin sauce.  Delish!  My carnivore husband loves the lamb & the Peas Pillau (a yummy rice with peas, raisins & nuts)  I would give Taj 5 stars if it wasn't for the consistency.  On a few occasions, I've ordered the usual, gotten it home and it tasted crappy!  I've phoned in everytime after and they've apologized and offered to pay for my next order.  Different chef working that night :/   Overall, LOVE!! :)",

One girl in our party found a piece of very thick hair in her chicken curry.  The manager is so rude on the phone. I asked him a question on the phone while making reservations and what did he tell me...\"ma'am I'm very busy right now, can you call back later or just come down to ask your question wth!\" Never again.

Their food is rich in flavor, content, and taste. This might be sneaky, but I got a good look at their kitchen when I was walking to use washroom- their kitchen is huge and from all that I've seen, it is spotless clean.  That showed in the quality of their food and its taste.   Service was good.   The Bad:  Nothing. Nada!  If you insist, I still don't have anything.   Bottom line:  If you live in Las Vegas and you are craving Indian, this is the place I recommend you go.  I will go back there soon to try out their lunch buffet.",

I remembered the meal I had was pretty good, so when we got some coupons in the mail the wife and I decided to go again.  I'm in no way or form an expert on Indian food as I've always enjoyed the east Asian curries more, so the wife and I played it safe and went with a full order of Tandoori Murgh Shahnaz (marinated baked chicken on the bone) and Jhinga Tikka Masala (prawns with onion and peppers in a tomato cream sauce). On the side was garlic naan and white rice.  The chicken, being thighs and legs, was as good as I remembered. Served a sizzling cast iron plate on a bed of onions and peppers. They managed to render out most of the fat while cooking (thanks to the clay oven), but managed to keep all of the flavor.  The prawn dish was delicious, but for $16 I would expect more prawns or at least bigger ones. The highlight of the dish was the tomato cream sauce that found it's way on top of my chicken rapped in naan.  The service was quick, attentive, and funny. When I ordered both dished with the rice & naan combo add on for $5 the waiter suggested just a double order of naan and a single order of rice. That kind of customer service is very highly appreciated.  When it came time to go we had some left overs that definitely earned a trip home with us. I appreciate it when a restaurant gives you decent to-go containers and these guys didn't attempt to have us shove everything in one big Styrofoam container but gave us smaller ones for each component of the meal. Perhaps a silly thing to comment on, but I like it when my left-overs look just as good as the day I ordered them.  Is this an \"authentic Indian\" restaurant? Damned if I know, but since the staff is Indian and very friendly I imagine if you flexed your knowledge they'll be accommodating.",

When we visited the buffet was uninspired, featured no paneer option, and was severely lacking in spice and overall layers of flavour. It felt geared toward middle America's palate rather than those of expats from the sub-continent and those of us with a bit of experience in the True heavenly flavours of the region.   Give me a good curry and some tasty naan to mop up the sauce and I am happy. Sadly, Taj Palace presented my usual go to dish, the chicken tikka masala, as a disappointinging bland, rather sweet, and lacking any real zest and the naan was almost tasteless.  The food looked OK, but this is the sort of Indian a grandparent would eat. I'll stick to Mint or Mt Everest.",

It pretty much accessible from the street and is located in a market complex with other good options for foodies. Now lets look at their menu. Menu is pretty much what every Indian restaurant offers in the States. But you may dig out a few extra ordinary items just like I did. Spicy Haryali chicken is awesome. Dont be fooled by its name its spicynesa can be controlled at the time of ordering. We ordered level 8 and our server suggested to bring it down to level 7 coz 8 would've been really spicy. 9-10 are out of question. Never do that in an Indian Restaurant. The breads are really soft and one of the best I have had ever in the US. Ordered garlic nan and butter tandoori roti. Next and always a must for us is biryani. Its not your regular dumm biryani but quite good spicy and boneless tikka chicken biryani. Overall I am too choosy when it comes to biryanis, yet i would rate this at 7 on 10.   Overall a good dinig place and really the best Indian food option when in vegas. Avoid those junk places that offer cheap buffet dinners. Will surely visit again when back in sin city.",

It also has a nice atmosphere, and the service is very good. the only thing I miss here is that they do not have a lamb dish at the buffet. But, for a $12 Sunday brunch meal, I guess you can't complain. A couple of times, I was the only non-Indian person there, so you know you are in the right place!",

    "text": "My first time trying Indian food! What a great place to try something for the first time!  When walking into an Indian restaurant for the first time, the smell of the spices and herbs they use hits you pretty hard. It was very surprising. It grows on you though.  With my lack of knowledge with Indian food, I just let Nieves D. & Carl I. Take the wheel and order the food.  For starters they bring out their version of Chips & salsa. it's a very thin seasoned chip that you can break.. and for the dips it includes a green spicy dip and a sweet tangy dip. Both quite Delish.   Tikka Masala Saucy chicken- I can't even explain how delicious this was. The sauce had the right amount of spices to give a good kick. The chicken in it just melted in my mouth it was so good. Was not dry at all.   Tandoori sizzling chicken- we got a whole chicken and it was more than enough for us. The most moist chicken I ever had! Again, the spices used give the chicken so much flavor. Spices that I have never tasted before. Chicken was cooked above perfection.   Lamb spicy coconut curry- I'm not really a fan of lamb so I just took a bite and decided to stick with the chicken. But the sauce the lamb was swimming in was pretty damn good. If it had a different meat in it, I'd probably devour it.   Garlic Naan- Their version of garlic bread. You can dip the bread in the sauces of the dishes you order and it pairs up quite well.   You get this mango shake when you check in. The service was good, the food just took forever to com out. But it was defiantly worth the wait! They even brought out mango ice cream with a candle for my birthday! What a great birthday dinner!",

However, yesterday's Mother's Day dinner was shockingly disappointing. I asked for Mango Lassi & Chicken Biryani, which came with a mountain of days-old Biryani rice, not more than 5 tiny bite bits of left-over Chicken pieces, & a watery Raita without any cucumber. The Biryani cost $15. That was simply just RICE! I asked for some curry gravy to make it palatable. The answer was No, spoken graciously but certainly mindlessly. I packed & left.",

The food takes longer to make and prep, in my opinion, but worth the wait as soon as you get to eating!  What I've gotten the last two visits are the infamous Tikka Masala and Chicken Tandoori.  Tikka Masala - famous dish in all Indian places that they guarantee all first timers will like. Pieces of moist, tender chicken cooked in a tomato-y, gingery sauce! Very rich and hearty! Suggest you dip their freshly baked Garlic Naan in this sauce!  Chicken Tandoori - sizzling, marinated chicken cooked in the tandoor, on a bed of peppers and onions. Seasoned very well, comes out in the red color because of the spices. Moist and a little spicy for my palette but I still love the dish! Great to eat with their Basmati Rice!  I'm glad we took our friend, Sandra R, here for her first time. A bit scared at first because she hated the smell that ALL Indian places have. She liked it, definitely ate everything on her plate. Upon paying and getting ready to leave, the waiter was so sweet, providing a small bowl of mango ice cream and put a candle on it because it was her birthday.   Small gestures are a plus! Will definitely be coming back when craving Indian food! I hope to try their buffet style one day, but available only from Monday - Sunday 11:00am to 3:00pm.",

    "text": "Just noticed a picture of Iron Mike Tyson posing with the owner, so apparently this must be a local favorite of his.    I came here awhile back for the lunch buffet and while the selection was fairly extensive, the single item that beckoned me to return was their garlic naan.   Served piping hot straight from the tandoori oven, the aroma is ethereal and it is one of the best I have ever had.  If you wait too long, the soft pillowy texture transforms into a stale saltine cracker-like consistency so please don't hold anything back and just attack that naan like Tyson on Holyfield's ear.  I try to rate Indian restaurants on their regular menu rather than buffet since there can often be a steep drop off in quality of food although their buffet is somewhere between 3-4 stars.  On my return visit with a friend for dinner, we ordered the Goat Vindaloo and the Malai Kofta (vegetable balls served in a heavy cream sauce loaded with spices such as cumin, coriander, and chili) and a side of the chili garlic naan.   The server will ask you to give a number from 1-10 regarding spice level.  We chose 7 for the vindaloo and 5 for our vegetarian entry.  Combined with the chili garlic naan, our tastebuds were on overdrive for most of the meal and in retrospect, I think the garlic naan is perfect on its own minus the chilis and 5 is plenty of spice to perk up the flavors without constantly reaching for water.    The goat in the tangy and hot vindaloo sauce was amazingly tender and very flavorful and was accompanied by some nice hunks of potato.  I actually didn't mind the fact that some of the pieces were still attached to bone since those were some of the best parts.   The malai kofta balls were savory with the vegetable component, slightly sweet in part due to some raisins within the mixture, and the complex sauce was both creamy and spicy providing a beautiful spectrum of flavors.    Throw in the beautiful interior, nice choice in silverware and plating, and the excellent service, this is a great option for those venturing out to Henderson in the mood for something off the beaten path.  Do take advantage of the $5 off dinner coupon for checking in on Yelp and do not leave without partaking in the garlic naan.",

There was some incense burning and although the smell wasn't really all that pleasant, I got over it eventually and didn't think much of it.  For our dinner outing, I opted for the paneer tikka masala paired up with some garlic naan. The food was alright but nothing to write home about. I thought the tikka masala lacked flavor and the naan was a bit dry in comparison to what I am used to at other places. Other people in my party ordered the chicken tikka masala and I decided to get in on it just to see if there was any difference in flavor between the two. Surprisingly, there was not. Oh well.. I came to get fed and that happened so I guess I'm good haha. Luckily, someone in our group had a coupon to take off some of the damage from the bill.  Not bad but not enticed to come here on a regular/semi-regular basis. I'd probably give it another chance but might expand to other options on the menu instead of my usual Indian comfort dinner dish.

    "text": "Seven days a week, 11-3, Taj Palace has a lunch buffet for $9.99.  Located in the the shopping center on Eastern and Richmar, this new Indian restaurant is rich in decor and cuisine. The hand painted tapestry style wall mural, lantern style light fixtures, and open lighting gives a bright look that most Indian places lack. The service was the best I have had in a long time. As we sat ourselves, the waiter came over to ask what kind of naan we would like and filled our water glasses. Throughout the meal, our dirty plates never stayed on the table for more than 5 minutes, if even that long. Water glasses were promptly refilled at the half way mark as well.   The food was consistent. I found that I did not hate anything, but the tandoori chicken was dry. The garlic naan is amazing. When brought out, it was piping hot and topped with a copious amount of garlic. The line had two different kinds of rice; basmati and a vegetable biryani. They also had somosas that were tasty. The saag (spinach) here was delicious, but did not have the paneer (handmade cheese). The other non-meat dish I really liked was the veggies in the yellow curry. For those who love their meat, do not fret, because Taj Palace offer some dishes for the carnivores as well. The chicken tikka masala was creamy and possessed a deep, rich flavor. The goat curry was tender and not gamey. Do not forget to get a bowl of the kheer (rice pudding) before leaving. Taj Palace's version is not too sweet and has cashews for a nice crunch. It was the perfect end to a great meal.",

We ordered the Tandoori Jhinga (shrimp), chicken tikka masala, one regular naan, one garlic naan, and a mango lassi.  Everything was great! Chicken tikka masala was spiced just right (..I think we could've handled a bit more spiciness) and shrimp tandoori was yummy. Garlic naan was a bit overcooked so we ordered a regular naan, which was just right.   The restaurant itself is in a great location, spacious, with nice ambience.   Overall, I'm glad there's an Indian restaurant in the Silverado area definitely worth a repeat visit :)",

Everything is fresh and doesn't taste watered down like they're trying to stretch the food out, plus the price is decent. Additionally, the service is great! Very friendly and attentive.   My faves are the the tandoori chicken, the curried chicken and the chicken tikka masala (the latter isn't my tummy's favorite dish but that's another story for another day).   They also give you all-you-can-eat naan (I get garlic naan) with a buffet purchase. Many restaurants make you pay per order for the naan so that's a huge draw for me.  We've eaten here about 5 times and we've never been disappointed!",

A side of garlic naan and buttered prata. The both dishes were so delicious and on point with spices. We ordered spice level 8 and I think the waiter has to repeat to make sure that's the spice levels we ordered. The lamb was very tender and had cubes of potatoes in it. There sauce thickness was just perfect for dunking with the naan. The curries were served with basmati rice. The one item we ordered that wasn't great was the prata. We asked the waiter if they had the roti prata type and they politely apologize they don't make those. Service was friendly and attentive. Will definitely be back again!",

First off, everything in my to-go order was packaged so nicely--there were no leaks or spills! Amazing! The chicken tikka masala was excellent and very delicious--I would definitely order it again. The flavors of the karahi paneer were beautiful. However I found the garlic naan and samosas to be just so-so. I have had better elsewhere. The gulab jamun were great. I was surprised that my order came with rice since when I ordered it clearly said rice was not included. I had read the other reviews saying rice wasn't included as well so I prepared basmati rice at home. When I got home with the food I was pleasantly surprised to see that they had given me a large container of rice. Thanks! I'd pick up from here again; had no problems with ordering, pick up and the food was great.",

They had a lunch buffet for $11.95, which was a really good deal. However, they allowed menu ordering. Yay!!   Lamb samosas were divine with shredded lamb - not ground or sausage. Cooked with perfect seasoning and very moist. It was a hard decision between the mint and tamarind sauce. Both so full of flavor!!  Hubby had Karthi Chicken at 5 level for hotness. It packed a good punch of spice and flavor. Jazmine rice, light and fluffy, as expected.  Tried the mushroom matar curry. Holy moly what a delightful dish, especially with peas. Only possible improvements would be to use different mushrooms - maybe portobello and/ or shiitake?  We did leave with leftovers, which is always delightful! Service was very good. Not sure the AC was working well but it felt a bit warm. Good selection of Indian beer but no Hayward today.",

It is very spacious, good for small and large parties. They have a giant bar area so I assume they have a full bar. The lunch buffet is set against the wall next to the bar.   Both times service was ok, the bussers were much more friendly than servers. Our drinks were constantly refilled, dirty plates were quickly picked up.   I think the lunch buffet is about $11 or $12, very good deal. The Buffy includes: tandoori chicken, few different types of rice, various types of curry (both vegetarian and non-vegetarian), small salad selection, and dessert. For the price the quality was very good!  For dinner we ordered goat curry, this was so delicious. The meat was tender, sauce was perfectly seasoned, simply delicious! We also got garlic nan, shrimp \"fried rice\" - we ordered level 4 spicy and this burned a little! We also ordered a lamb dish that was also very good!   Overall this is a nice place for Indian food. Chelsea than their places I've been too and the food was delicious! Will definitely come back!",

    "text": "Yes, I'll give it a 4 star (above average to me) for being a nice Indian restaurant in the States. To me Indian food in the states is pretty tricky, if you had Indian food in cities outside of India, like London, you understand what I mean. Finding a fabulous Indian restaurant in the US is like finding a fabulous Mexican place in Europe, very hard to come by.  I have tried Indian food on both coasts and in the mid-west (which I highly recommend not to do) and Taj Palace is pretty darn good.  I have dined here a few times, so I guess it's time to do my Yelp elite duty and review it :).   On my most recent visit, I tried the lunch buffet as I have come in for dinner before. The price was excellent for the amount of choices. I'm not huge on buffets (I know... I live in Vegas)  and only go if I have too. Reason being is, I would rather have a dish cooked great than a bunch of food cooked mediocre served under heat lamps! Who here agrees?? So with that said, the buffet is really quite nice! There were plenty of tasty options and it did not taste dried out, well of course not because the food is in curry form- Duh, Trix! There are plenty of spicy sauces and mixes so you can add to flavor it up to your taste. This was awesome for me because well, you know, I like it Spicy Baby! ;)  The naan bread is fantastic. I ordered the garlic naan instead of the regular. It was not dry but it was so flavorful! I loved how they bring it to you upon order because there is nothing worse than under-a-heat-lamp-dry-as-dirt naan bread!   So yay! A great Indian place on my side of town. I definitely will come back ad definitely recommend!",

I do not like writing bad reviews but it would have been a simple solution but the server even got the cook who then continued to challenge me how it wasn't dry and they would not replace my meal. Very unhappy and I should expect this from an East Indian restaurant they're very cheap and they don't care, all they care about is losing on food costs.",

    "text": "This is a True Vegas hidden gem! Sadly at 6pm we are the restaurant's only patrons - hopefully this is the exception because hands down it is some of the best Indian food I have had to date. The menu descriptions sorely lack detail with the amazing melange of flavors in every bite. We enjoyed the lentil soup which was spicy (as requested) with a great bouquet of aromas and tastes. The main course was the chicken korma and saag paneer with a side of basmati rice and garlic naan. Described as a dish with a creamy sauce, the korma was bar-none the best I've ever had. Herby, rich, with great onion and tomato flavorings mixed into a creamy dish over a lovely chicken thigh (In guessing based on tenderness) it was really good stuff. If you're in the mood for buffet, they offer a daily variety of options (so they told us) so check that out. This will be a return spot for us - go check it out soon!!",

And it was so so so good! I had the China masala, eggplant and basmati rice. Of course mild mild  no spicy mild! Well it had a little kick from what seems to have been the ginger so I was cool with that! Get it, hot ginger cool attitude LOL??? Anyway.....it all traveled well. And both were delish! The portions were just as full as if I had eaten there. I had leftovers  for brunch! Everything was super fresh including the actual fresh herbs and spices that you could actually see and tsste in the food! The service was friendly and very helpful to allergy suffers and Vegas alike. Lots of poultry choices and seafood for you none veggie types. Great choice when in vegas or if you live in Henderson.",

The chicken is a little dry, but I have to give this place 5 stars for making good, filling food and for the unlimited naan. The garlic naan is really good too, make sure you get a plate of those.  The restaurant is clean and the wait staff are all friendly and approachable even when it gets busy. Definitely check this place out!",

The vinegary flavor to it was a great contrast to the masala dish. My only gripe about this place is I wished they put more meat pieces into the dishes. Especially for the price. Although the flavorful sauces are enough to satisfy you, but more meat would be a plus. I'll be more adventurous and try the lamb and goat next time.",

Because I read the hours wrong, I arrived about 40 minutes before 5p and therefore during the time they're closed (their hours are 11a to 3p, then 5p to 10:30p). I found something to do in the meanwhile because I was still craving Indian food and arrived a few minutes after 5p.  As soon as you enter the restaurant, there is a strong aroma that may be a little overpowering. I wanted to do the take out option and was seated at the bar waiting to order. It took longer than I expected, but the people were nice and kept offering me drinks. They took my order (lamb tikka masala and chicken curry) and I played on my phone in the meanwhile. A word of caution. I didn't order any naan because I had rice at home, but it looks like just one piece of naan is $2.50. One piece of garlic naan is $3.50. No, thank you.  They arrived with my food, I paid, and I went home. I've never really had Indian food before and fortunately, I was not disappointed with my choices. Both the lamb tikka masala and chicken curry were delicious. The portions were big enough that I had leftovers that still tasted good the day after. I'd definitely go back and order more food for take out.",

I like everything so far. You can buffet to go as well, they will give you a box, naan and a small cup for soup to go.",

    "text": "It was okay. 1st time was better but this time they missed the mark. I ordered butter chicken and they made a shortcut by; just taking chicken off the bone that they took off of chicken tandoori & usually supposed to be made from chicken breast similar to chicken tikaa masala it was just too hard to chew for my dad. Other than that flavor was there a little on sweet side was creamy though base was there but just a little rushed. Now for the naan, it had good flavor but so soggy when I received my delivery. I know it's not a delivery issue because last time I ordered delivery it was fresh and had the perfect crisp last time. Last time I ordered everything was great. This experience not so much. Just few suggestions for what i ordered and price point the portion size needs to be a but more for family size or change the minimum for delivery to get the right ratio or money's worth. Next time I will probably dine in but not likely after this experience. I recommend Mint or India Masala  I wish i could rate higher sorry guys!!",

Our Indian waiter stated he likes spicy and eats his food at level 6/10, so I ordered lamb curry level 4/10 to be on the safe side, but it was more of a 1/10. They may have forgotten on mine. The Palaak Paneer we ordered 2/10 was spicier than the lamb curry.  It was decent and on par with most Indian restaurants I've been to throughout various states.  The goat Biryani was flavorful,  one of the best I've had.  I typically don't really eat it, but I'll definitely order there's again.  It's worth me giving them another try on the curry.  The goat and the lamb were fairly tender.  I did have a few tough pieces of lamb,  but most of it was tender.",

We asked the acting manager to bring a dish for everyone to share \"family style\" that represents dishes of which they are proud. He beamed at the opportunity and the staff was incredible in their service.   Those of us who regularly love Indian food couldn't have asked for a nicer, more friendly and higher-quality experience with which to introduce friends to this cuisine. I even appreciate that they took emphasis to make the vegetarian in our group (me) feel catered among the majority meat dishes. I adored my tikka masala paneer, rice (with pine nuts and raisins) and mushroom-veg dishes, and everyone else raved for the tandoor lamb ribs, curries, and shrimp.   I wish I were eating Indian food like this all the time -- and with management/staff who is this splendid, no matter the cuisine. But alas I don't live in the Vegas area. Taj Palace is a treasure in the land of ordinarily low expectations for nondescript strip mall restaurants.",

After much scrambling around and another 15 minutes of waiting, I got my food. The portions for the takeout were a little on the small side for the price.   It tasted good though, so I decided to order takeout again. The second time, I had a certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a>. I specifically looked at the certificate before I bought it and it did not say anything about dine-in only. I called and ordered (about $100 worth of food) and told them I had the certificate. They said ok and then I hung up. I get a call back a few minutes later saying that the certificate is for dine-in only. I told them it doesn't say that, and what did it matter. I then offered to pay them a tip for the whole meal so they wouldn't lose out on that. They said no. So I told them I wanted to cancel my order. After talking to their owner, they were still ok with giving up my business and cancelled my order.   Maybe other people will have better luck, but they aren't getting my business anymore.",

With an assortment of vegetarian and chicken dishes seasoned to perfection with delicious spices, you are sure to find your favorite! I love their tikka masala and tandoori chicken, which is always fresh and juicy. The naan is complimentary and, although it takes a little bit to arrive at your table (it is freshly made every time), it is DEFINITELY worth the wait. This place is so good that even their jasmine rice is on point, every single time.   I do not know about you, but I love a rich mango lassi with my indian meals...and that's where I think they would do a bit of a better job. Do not get me wrong, their lassi is good but a bit too sweet compared to other ones I have had. And, for $5 a piece they are a bit pricey.  Conclusion? Come to this place, especially for lunch, and enjoy a great meal!",

There are not as many restaurants you can truly say that. Also, ordered garlic nan & and there stuffed cheese nan. Both were delicious. The average entire cost about $18. Depending on your party the serving sizes are enough to share as long as everyone orders one. Not a place I would eat on the regular, but I would go back to eat there for a date night or a nicer dinner with friends. I recommend this restaurant to any one the has a love for Indian food.

I decided to try this place as it is the closest to where I currently live.  The Good -- * Their garlic naan is by far the best I've had. It's very light, fluffy, and buttery. A 'little' better than Angara Spice (West Flamingo) and way better than Urban Turban (off Paradise). * Their Tikka Masala and Tandoori chicken are standard fare. It tastes good but no better or worse than the other places.  The Bad -- Their kheer (rice pudding) was chunky and runny at the same time. Angara Spice definitely has them beat here as the kheer at Angara Spice is consistently smooth.  Secondly, they (like most Indian restaurants around town) LACK the presence of a lot of MUMBAI foods, especially street foods like Pav Bhaji. So, Urban Turban beats them there just for HAVING pav bhaji. Nothing I tasted here is worth writing home about. It's all standard fare and their buffet is slightly smaller with less food on it than some of the other buffets. Also, this location is a little more hustle and bustle than the   other Indian restaurants, which is why they have more seating and a larger room.",

    "text": "I forget how much I love the beautiful spices and breads offered in Indian cuisine. My experience at Taj took me back to my favorite restaurant in San Francisco!  First, the garlic naan bread lived up to my expectations providing  a light,  tasty, soft with just enough crunch texture.  The prawns were perfectly simmered in a delicious sauce. The lamb dish was deliciously tender and at an 8 heat level,  provided just the amount of spice I was craving!  Finally, the vegetarian stew rounded out the table atop the light, fluffy rice. I wanted to keep eating but I was too full!  Staff was soft spoken and interested in our dining experience!  The owner introduced himself and welcomed us to return another day. We were almost the last diners to close the restaurant down so it was late. The staff waved us cheerfully good bye.  Probably because they really wanted to call it a day. But they never made us feel rushed. I'll be back for the buffet as I really want to try more items. And oh that bread, it's devine!!!",

    "text": "Now I'm not a connoisseur at Indian cuisine.  This is probably only my second time ever having it.  One thing I know is when food is delicious...and this food was fantastic!  Very attentive service as soon as I walked into the door.  I knew I wanted to try something vegetarian, so the waiter helped me out and let me know some of the favs veggie dishes. I knew that I wanted to try the samosas, so I started my night with some of those.  I must say that they taste so much better than the frozen ones I usually buy from the supermarket.  Haha.  Great potato filling with excellent seasoning. I don't really know what the green sauce is that comes with every table, but it paired well with them.  Decided on ordering the Paneer Masala, full order of basmati rice, and I've read so much about the garlic naan that I had to see if the hype was real.  Mann it sure was real!  That naan is top notch! I had no idea it would be so much food (just meant that the next day...leftovers). I ordered the masala with a level 6 spice, and it was very mild.  I know now I can take it up to an 8 or 9 on my next visit.  The richness of flavor really hooked me in, and the naan pairs perfectly with it.  I now know that a full order of rice will feed two (or me twice). The paneer has a tofu like texture and didn't taste like cheese at all.  I'm wondering if this type of meal can be super fattening.  Guess I'll find out soon because I will be back again!  Great flavor, cool atmosphere, relaxing decor.  This will be one of my favs",

We normally get the chicken tikka masala, but I've heard their butter chicken is excellent. Every bite of food is delicious here, and all of the servers are very knowledgeable about people with a gluten allergy which is always helpful.

That's always awesome!   Service was great; just what I expected. Answered questions, brought us more water on a regular basis, check came quickly, food came quickly, etc.  This place is WAY better than Mount Everest India's Cuisine!  I don't know understand why that place gets more stars than Taj Palace; this place has better portions, comparable prices and better service.  And the food comes out faster!!!  After my first visit here, I came back the very next night for takeout; more Tandoori Shrimp, Basmati Rice, and the usual Chicken Masala.  Can't go wrong.  If you want great Indian food at reasonable prices, and you have a big stomach, definitely visit Taj Palace!~  Criticisms: - Lighting could have been better, seemed kind of dingy - Decor could use an upgrade  ---Overall---  Service: A.  Servers were friendly and answered questions I had about the food  Food: A+, great selection, BIG portions  Atmosphere: B-, chill and relaxed, but could use an upgrade in lighting and decor",

    "text": "I wanted to take my 79 yr old mother out for her first taste of Indian cuisine. I had visited Taj Palace many years before and decided to take her there. It was great! Our server, Vishal B., was wonderful. I explained it was my mother's first time trying Indian food and that I'd like recommendations for something that wouldn't be too spicy and scare her away. He gladly told my mother that he would take care of her like \"She was his own mother.\" He made several good suggestions and offered help on what spice level to try it at. She had the Tiki Masala and really enjoyed it. I had the Chicken Korma, one of my all-time favorites, and it was delicious. Everyone was very polite and attentive. The restaurant was clean and the food came quickly, was hot, and tasty. Mom and I will definitely back be back. Vishal suggested the buffet and we're hoping to try it next! If you're in Henderson I would definitely recommend trying Taj Palace.",

First, we asked for a chicken tikka masala with CHEESE just like how I like it, and the waiter even said \"Okay\" (language barrier?) anyway, we got chicken tikka masala and buttered chicken, and my husband and daughter ordered coke. I asked them for water also, which they served first along with the crunchy pita (which was half burnt, but we didnt really mind since it was free). I also got a free mango lassi from Yelp, and that was very delicious.  Our food came after 15 mins, and when I asked if the chicken tikka masala had extra cheese, he looked at me like I was dumb lol i asked again if theres cheese in the tikka masala and he said no, but he put extra butter. I asked for CHEESE, how is that the same as B.U.T.T.E.R???   Anyway, the tikka masala and the buttered chicken tasted EXACTLY the same because they put extra butter on it   Also- they didnt give us the coke. We asked for it when we were almost finished eating, and they served it after we finished eating. They said the bar tender wasnt there. How hard is it to pour coke on a glass? Lol they said they will give it for free, but we were already done so we really didnt want it anymore.  Overall, the place looks great, the food was still good, mango lassi was great, the crunchy pita was not good (but not bad either), waiter is friendly but the service is horrible. We spent about $80 on 2 dishes with rice, which was pretty pricey.",

My family really liked it but they don't eat out often at all. I felt like from all the Indian places that I've ever eaten at this one was on the pricier end. The stuff seemed either and like they couldn't be bothered. I know that sounds bad but we had a lot of questions to ask about the menu first and the questions weren't really answered. I think we were too starving to care at the time.  But I have definitely had better Indian food experiences. Are used to actually work at one here in Vegas and it was more warm, friendly and focused on customer service more than here.",

The restaurant is in a very restaurant heavy strip mall, so you literally have a ton of choices, but let me tell you that Taj Palace is one of the better ones.   The first time I went was for dinner. I got Chicken Tikka Masala and my friend got Chicken Vindaloo. Both dishes were delicious! So tasty. The servers were friendly and regularly refilled our waters. The second time I went was for the lunch buffet. They have a bunch of options on the buffet, including salads, vegetarian/vegan options, and meat selections (chicken and goat in various forms). The food was delicious, but not as spicy as if you order a dish off the menu.   I'd definitely recommend going here anytime you're looking for delicious Indian Food!!",

    "text": "OK, first a disclaimer. I'm British which may mean I have overly high standards for Indian food. That said, I've lived in the US for 8 years, so I feel I know what to expect.  My main gripes with this place were the fact it's overpriced ($5 for rice after ordering a $16 lamb curry) and the fact that the food was bland. The waiter asked how spicy (mild, medium, spicy) and I said medium. When the food game, it looked nice, but there was very little flavor and no spiciness I could detect. It wasn't horrible, but I've enjoyed Indian food in mall food courts more than the food at Taj Palace.  The service started off great (four waiters taking care of the two of us), but we were oddly left for 20 minutes after we'd finished out food with not a waiter in sight.  Also the booths were rickety! They don't seem to be attached to the walls, so I could feel every time the person behind me moved. It's difficult to describe this annoyance without sounding ridiculously petty, but I spent most of the meal leaning forward at an unnatural angle.  I really wanted this place to be good (not least as I'd talked my girlfriend out of her favorite Thai place that's in the same strip mall). A curry and beer on a Friday night ... the stuff (Englishmen's) dreams are made of! Maybe the lunch buffet is great, and that why this place has great reviews. I can't think of any other reason.",

Ended up ordering karahi chicken, palak paneer, dal makhani,naan and roti for our guests. When we brought home the order, we realized they had given us shahi or karahi paneer instead of the chicken. I called back and the guy was apologetic and offered to deliver the chicken to us. SInce the order had taken over 40 minutes and it was a busy saturday night, we offered to come and pick it up. 4 points for customer service as they compensated by giving us a complimentary pulao rice, and some achar relish and corrected the order. 2 points for the food however:  dal makhani-was extra creamy but tasted the best of the lot. palak paneer-was ok chicken karahi-which they claimed was the best chicken option was flavorless and pretty tasteless. pulao-was not bad, pretty decent. naan and roti were well made. they let us keep the paneer karahi as well, but unfortunately that was pretty tasteless too.  I usually love leftover food the next day but this I was happy to get rid off.  I will try them again as this may have been a freak day since they were busy, but it was disappointing considering our guests were looking forward to a nice indian meal and price wise the place is not cheap! I guess I will stick to the buffet for this one, as somehow the buffet experience has been ok every time but have not had the same luck with take out orders.",

I am by no means an Indian food connoisseur, but I know what it's supposed to look and taste like, and this was not it.  The yellow dahl was mealy. The spices were alright, but the texture was all wrong.  The vegetable biryani was dry. I also bit into some sort of pit.  The chicken tikka masala was a real joke. The chicken looked and tasted like an old breast cut into pieces and thrown into sauce (which was, fortunately, acceptable).  The chili (spiciest) chicken was just hot to be hot. There were no real flavors, making this dish a bust as well.  The highlight was the mango curry chicken -- nice juicy pieces of meat in a flavorful sauce. The naan was also ok.  None of the entrees (about $15 each) came with rice. If I had ordered enough for 4 people, it would've cost $10. Unbelievable.  I will not be ordering from/dining in this restaurant ever again. If anyone knows of authentic Indian cuisine in the Valley, please let me know.",

    "text": "As far as Indian food goes, Taj Palace is delicious. As far as service? Our waiter Vimal treated us like queens.   It's the typical strip-mall exterior, like almost all restaurants in Henderson, NV. Coming from Los Angeles, I'm starting to get used to great restaurants like this - after all, many wonderful treasures can be found in strip-mall style buildings in LA.  When we were seated around 8:30 PM, the entire restaurant was empty, so there was no wait. Vimal brought out Papadum (Indian bread, crispy and very thin like a cracker) with hot green sauce and a tasty plum sauce. We ordered veggie Samosas to start, which seemed to be hand-made at the restaurant and were spectacular. Vimal convinced us to try Nasi Biryani rice instead of the traditional white Basmati rice I normally order. It's like an Indian fried rice, with golden raisins and almonds that has a yellow coloring from the spices. Delicious. That came out with our chicken tikka masala in medium spiciness and our garlic naan. Every dish was better than the last. At this point a middle-aged couple came into the nicely decorated restaurant and sat down to dinner as well.   I think it's surprising that the place was so empty, considering how yummy everything was. The other couple verbally recognized this and asked Vimal about it as well. It seems new ownership took over more than a year ago, and he just needs to get the word out. So here's the word - we'll be stopping by again soon to check out the buffet for lunch, that seems like a great value!",

My favorite dish of all time at Indian buffet is the goat curry.   There was goat curry on the line, however, it wasn't flavorful as I would have liked it to be.  Thank goodness they were tender.  The chicken tandoori was kind of dry.  The kheer, which is the rice pudding, wasn't so delicious as the one over at India Palace.  I have to say that I enjoy the lunch buffet at India Palace much more.  I probably won't be coming back to Taj.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for my meal at Taj Palace.  I read the series of Yelp reviews and even recall a few friends stating it was a good place for curry. I have to presume, it was a bad night for the team at Taj Palace. As much as it pains me to write a \"negative\" review, I have to be True to my experience. We arrived on Friday evening around 8:30 pm. The Yelp reviews for Taj were higher than Ping Kao 3 my intended destination.  Upon arrival I noticed the large dining room had a total of three occupied tables.  The friendly waiters greeted and seated our party of two promptly. To make a long story bearable I will cut to the chase. I ordered a medium butter chicken, at $17.00 I anticipated a fantastic dish. My Partner, ordered a $16.00 lamb dish. He will write his own review.  To our amazement, the two dishes did not come with Naan or Rice. We ordered these items on the side. The plain basmati rice was $5.00 and the Naan was $3.50.  The food came out within ten minutes. Have to give an A for speed and service during the pre-dinner service. This team was on top of it. There were four servers for our table. Our water was never empty and the empty or unused plates/utensils disappeared quickly. So on to the food. I will only speak to my own dish. I have had several butter chicken (Murgh Makhani) dishes at different places. I am familiar with the expected flavor. This particular dish just did not taste like any butter chicken; I have had in the past. The color of the dish looked proper but the flavor was off. It almost tasted as if they used mayonnaise instead of cream or yogurt in the dish. It was slimy and did not have a good flavor at all. To supplement the flavor the meat within the dish was chopped into small bits. There were also chunks of bone, fat and bay leaf. It was just awful. Some might say, you should have sent it back. I have warded off sending any dishes back at restaurants, there are too many horror stories.  I simply did not finish it. The post-dinner service left us sitting with dirty dishes for twenty minutes. When the two waiters finally collected the plates they did not ask about our experience and did not notice most of my butter chicken was still in the dish.  I do not expect anyone to read my mind. It had to be a bad night.  Maybe, I will try again in the future.",

I have done take out from here on five or so occasions and my gf and I decided to eat at the restaurant this time. Huge mistake. The vegetarian app was good but was served on a bed of lettuce that was old a month ago. On to the entree's. I had lamb and she had fish, we added the basmati rice and some garlic nana.. Dinner was dropped off by a food runner and by the time we realized her order was incorrect everyone had disappeared. Well by the time I got up 5 minutes later to f find our waiter he was busy playing with his phone and flirting with the waitress working with him hidden behind a partition. Without asking our preference he took her plate leaving my entree, the rice and the nana and disappeared again. Now I had the dilemma of eating my food which was too spicy for her to share or waiting. I decided to wait. Fifteen minutes passed and her food was returned correct but by now my entree, the rice and the naan and the rice was cold. I picked at mine and she ate some of hers but it ruined the night. I worked in the food industry and this was just awful and unacceptable. When bringing the check he asked how everything was and I told him word for word and his response was 'well'. I will not return again which is a shame but wow. For $52? I am hoping the owner will see this and realize he has a near empty dining room nightly fora reason. Cannot remembered service.@",

As a Chicago resident, great restaurants are nothing new to me. But this is hands down the best Indian cuisine I have ever had! I highly recommend the Mango Chicken, and even moreso the Mint Chicken, which is quite possibly the best Indian chicken dish I've ever had.   The decor was nice, and the waiters very attentive; my glass was never below half full, and let me tell you, I was guzzling iced tea due to the heat from the dishes (I was asked how spicy I wanted my dishes on a 1-10 scale, and ordered an 8. I hear if you're really adventurous or just plan masochistic, you can go off the scale!)  In short, don't hesitate to try this place. It's nothing short of exquisite!!!",

All of the dishes were good, but I was a tad disappointed in the lentil soup. When done right, lentil soup is one of my top 10 favorite things to eat. Their rendition was a little lifeless.  The masala had a nice flavor. However, one thing that really took away from the meal was the incense burning behind the front counter. The scent was overpowering. Maybe it's a personal thing, but strong aromas (that aren't related to delicious food) take away from my ability to truly enjoy a meal. If we were in the area, we may stop back in to try the lunch buffet, but it won't be a destination dine for us. However, I would say it is a safe bet for a first date if you're looking to do something a little different.",

    "text": "I've been to Taj Palace a couple of times: for dinner and their lunch buffet. I've been to a few Indian restaurants around the valley over the years and that's what I'm comparing it to although I'm no expert.  Most Indian restaurants around town do a lunch buffet type of service and then a normal sit down dinner where you order off of a menu. Lunch buffets are a great way to find what you do and don't like and to experiment how you like to eat the food.  Most buffets separate the food as a salad bar and fruit area, a vegetarian area, and a meat area. I will say that I really liked their vegetarian options. My stand out dish was the vegetable samosa. The pastry was so flaky and buttery and the filling was very flavorful.   Taj Palace doesn't have a huge variety in my opinion, but most of their dishes were good, although a little light on spice and flavor. I did like how thin their naan bread was. I had a couple of dishes that had meat. I did enjoy their tandoori chicken which was most and seasoned well. I also enjoyed their goat curry which was very tender and flavorful.   Overall I feel like it's a solid Indian restaurant, but definitely not the best in town. I like how they have a wine list. The price is a great deal as with most similar establishments at around $12.99 per person. I'd advise they amp up the flavor and interact more with guests their paying or check out process is not the best. Their vegetarian dishes is what kept the rating up for me.",

    "text": "My first time to dine here with a friend who also loves Indian food. I heard about this restaurant from an Indian man I met while eating Thai food one day in Henderson. He said it was his favorite buffet for Indian food and I should try it. The ambiance is warm and welcoming, comfortable seating and we enjoyed the Indian music. There was a friendly smiling man standing back watching over everything and when he stopped by our table at one point we found out he's actually the owner. My dining mate and I told him we thoroughly enjoyed our food and I thought the samosas were the best I've ever had. Flaky outside, stuffed full like little pillows and very well seasoned. We both cleaned our plates which is unusual at a buffet and thought the spices and seasoning were aromatic and delicious. I prefer my Indian food a bit spicy hotter so next time I will add some of the wonderful condiments they provide for heat. But honestly, one cannot fault the spices nor call the food bland, IMHO. We both agreed this will be our new buffet choice for our own pleasure as well as out of town guests. Also, the garlic naan was just pure tasty deliciousness and I will return soon for dinner to try some menu items. Give this one a try, I don't think you'll be disappointed.",

    "text": "I haven't been here in over four years. Glad to see that time has been kind to it.  Taj Palace is an Indian restaurant in the massive Sansone Park Place plaza on the eastern side of Eastern Ave, near Richmar. This kind of place is still not very popular throughout the Las Vegas valley, and it's the only one in Henderson. I don't actually eat Indian food all that often, and I didn't have it at all on my radar.  Back story time: a friend had invited me to join a small group for a weekly Thursday dinner, but he hadn't informed me of the location. I was ready to go home for leftovers after grabbing a milk tea with several calorie-laden toppings from Brew Tea Bar, one of the newest stores in the same plaza at Taj. In walked one of the person whom I know is in the small group for dinner. I said hi, we talked, and I followed them to dinner to greet and kinda surprise the others. After I smelled the enticing aromas while still standing outside, I caved in and joined them to eat.  Service was oddly slow to start. We grabbed a table but didn't receive a menu for at least ten minutes. At least we were able to chat and munch on some sort of complimentary cracker, along with the two sauces on the table. The tamarind sauce was sweet and therefore easily enjoyed, and the mint/cilantro sauce was also satisfying until I really started to feel the spiciness on my tongue. Cue foreshadowing.  We each ordered an item to share, and most of us also utilized Yelp to check in for free mango lassis ($5 regular price). I loved this drink. Not only did it help to cool the burn later on, but the mango flavor was strong, the sweetness was on the right edge of being overpowering (in other words, it wasn't quite that saccharine), and the hint of cardamom was a welcome counterpoint.  The food almost seemed to arrive faster than the menus. One item arrived oddly early, then a huge platter with the remainder arrived. There was some sort of rice which was either complimentary or was a side dish meant to accompany an entree, but I don't recall which one that may have been. The rest of the items were priced and listed on the receipt as follows.  Chicken Tikka Masala ($16): a very good version of this British national dish (seriously, look it up) which somehow didn't completely destroy my palate despite being ordered as a 7 (out of 10 in spicy level). The protein was moist if not especially flavorful in and of itself, but obviously the tikka masala part is the store. There was plenty of sauce to be sopped up with carbs, so you won't go wrong with this order.  Garlic Naan ($7): one of said carbs. We had two portions, each of which comes with four pieces of the flatbread. It wasn't especially prominently garlicked or buttered, in my opinion, but it served its purpose, which for me was mainly as a \"hand\" for clumsily shoving food onto my fork. Yeah, I do that kinda stuff if I can.  Shrimp Biryani ($18): my choice. It's almost at the end of the menu, and the full flowery description of this dish enticed me to pick one. Went with a 5 out of 10 on the heat scale, and it didn't really annoy my capsaicin receptors except on the first bite of shrimp, which had a properly cooked sort of bite to it. Biryani appears to be an Indian version of something like pilaf or paella, but the star wasn't actually in the tasty mixed rice portion. It was the raita, a yogurt sauce served on the side. It adds creaminess and a mild acidic element. I absolutely adored the combination and therefore highly recommend this dish.  Lamb Curry ($16): I definitely recalled that lamb curry was ordered and that this dish was announced tableside as lamb curry, but I didn't taste anything at all that reminded me of lamb and only remembered that it was lamb when I saw the receipt. I guess the plus side is there was clearly no gamy taste? Consequently, I would not recommend this dish to lamb fans.  Tandoori Chicken ($11 for a half-size portion): four of the \"drumette\" portions of chicken wings, reportedly cooked in a tandoor (no, I didn't walk into the kitchen to try to spot the traditional clay oven) and served on a sizzling platter with onions and other veggies. Delicious and not dry. I tried out a squeeze of the lemon wedge that was plated with the chicken, and I'd say the result is different but just as good.  I never forgot about Taj Palace, but I won't overlook them now that I've had this dinner. It is a great change of pace for Henderson residents and could be a good change of scenery for those living across town. I'll definitely have to schedule a lunch buffet revisit to cushion the blow to my wallet.",

The wall in our booth was less than clean and they played random Bollywood music videos on a screen above the bar (think Britney Spears meets Bollywood) but the food and service were terrific!   My hubs had the tandoori chicken and I had the chicken tikki Marsala and had some garlic naan bread. We also had the chicken samosas - honestly they looked like they may have been frozen (not 100% positive) but they were pretty tasty (and VERY spicy). Everything was absolutely delicious and there were plenty of leftovers for us to take home. My only side note would be I think the naan was overpriced- we got like three pieces for $7 but was yummy either way.   I never had to ask for a refill on a drink - servers were on top of taking care of us from start to finish. Overall great experience and we will definitely be back!",

The samosas has a really spicy potato and pea filling. And I mean spicy. Like a HOT order of Indian food. I've eaten samosas at many places and these were so much spicier than I've ever had before. The tamarind sauce was delicious, sweet, and slightly tart. The pastry was crispy and flakey, but I would tone the heat down slightly.  The chicken tikka masala was spiced to order (I asked for medium) and the chicken was really tender. Great balance of flavors.  The naan was soft with crusty parts just like it's supposed to be.  4 stars because the samosas were super spicy",

    "text": "Rediscovering my love for Indian food, I had decided to try this place out after discovering how close it was to home.  This establishment is located in the same lot as Cafe Zupas, BJ's, and Brew Tea Bar. Walking in the spacious interior, I was a little concerned about how empty the restaurant was. However, I decided to stay and give the place a try after taking its many positive reviews into consideration.  There are many dishes to choose from and the menu is very expansive. I chose the chicken tikka masala ($16). If you do not want chicken, they also have vegetarian and goat versions available. The flavorful dish comes with a side of basmati rice. I had ordered a level 6, which usually suffices my sort-of-there spicy tolerance, but it was not as spicy as I had hoped. Though it is a little pricier than I expected, the portion was pretty big and I could have easily shared with someone else had I known before hand.  The garlic naan ($7) that I had ordered on the side was very delicious and paired perfectly with the rest of our dishes. It came out warm and pillowy. I could have eaten the garlic naan for my entire meal if I really wanted to (but then again -- it's bread. And who doesn't love bread)!  Mango lassi ($7) was very refreshing (and much needed after deciding to try my boyfriend's maximum spicy curry). It tasted very fresh and creamy. I think I drank it a little too fast!  Service, though pleasant, was a big lacking. They were there when necessary, but if you needed something you have to wave someone down to come to you.  The food will definitely have me coming back. I'm very excited to try more dishes and maybe check out the lunch buffet they offer. So happy this is close to home, but my wallet isn't as excited!",

Tried this place a few years ago when they first opened as we received a coupon for a buy 1 get 1 free buffet and have been coming back on a regular basis. Fast forward to today, the price of the weekend buffet is still the same! It's only approximately $10.99 for a buffet on the weekends and there is something for everyone as the variety of the selection of food is great! You get unlimited naan bread and the garlic one is to die for! It comes out fresh and hot! The food is always on point as the waiters work hard to make sure there buffet line is replenished with fresh dishes.   This is by far the best Indian restaurant in Las Vegas!",

I was a big net promoter of theirs however on Sunday I ordered masala and rice pilau (something I always order) and the rice looked weird, different color to the typical yellow and all the nuts were burnt black.  How do you send this out surely you see!  Yesterday I ordered again almost on auto pilot as I eat their so often and it got worse the rice again was weird, mushy and filled full of char burnt ingredients nuts Etc.  The worse part is the curry was very weird, heated up it would not join and settle. The oil was separating, representing 30%. The consistency was way off and the food looked so bad I couldn't even try to eat it.   IMO the chef must have left and a server picked up the reins.  Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. There will not be a third!  To send this food out demonstrates the lack of quality control, I can no longer trust Taj Palace to cook and deliver food.",

If you can't take the spiciness, you can ask for this white sauce thingy that you can add to your food to make it less spicy, which I did. Lots of vegetarian options, but also had goat and chicken entrees. The buffet even had some desserts such as watermelon slices and rice pudding.   The service was amazing! The waiter kept the water refills coming and took the dirty dishes right away.   And lastly, the interior decorations and the ambiance of the restaurant is perfect! Very Indian style and great for groups or even dates! :)",

I assume they're used to deliver the food. 2 hrs later I have no food and taj says EAT24 never came. EAT24 claimed they don't deliver for Taj. So who screwed up?!?? Either way.

I noticed there tandoori chicken is half cooked. not just one piece , the whole thing there. after i showed them, they immediately fixed it. Not even an Apology from the manager or the waiter. I should have taken some pictures but before i did they grabbed my plate and took it into the kitchen. Tandoori chicken is often seasoned well so you might not recognize the half cooked chicken until you see what you are eating. Tandoori chicken is one thing i like there but they ruined it for me.  I am pretty sure, its not the way indian goat curry will taste. There Biriyani is tasteless.  I like the samosa portion, very filling.  There vegetarian section is not great either.  Indians do not like to taste the rawness in the chicken. Normally they cook it to perfection in Turmeric and other spices. Americans might not notice it but Indians do. if you want to notice what i am talking about, take any chicken piece , clear off the sauce and take a bite and you will find the difference if you ever had a authentic Indian meal at a friends house.  Can not say any thing great about there desert but if its your first time go for it.  There Nan tastes good and during lunch buffet hours , they don't charge extra for garlic Nan.   staff is very kind and courteous. bathrooms are clean.  There is no use of having a TV in there, always some decoration will be blocking your view from any side.  Summary: Overall there is no soul in the food and i will not recommend this restaurant over other indian restaurants like India Masala (1040 E Flamingo Rd, Las Vegas, NV 89119) or Shalimar (4001 S Decatur Blvd #31, Las Vegas, NV 89103)",

Staff is very attentive and polite which is nice, sometimes i go in on a slow night with my 5 year old for mommy son dinner dates and the place is empty so i dont feel like he is bothering anyone. Plates are def big enough for 2. Decor inside is beautiful, date worthy.   I always get the murgh madras combo. I have had it spicy and non spicy by accident when they forgot to ask. I have to admit spice is key when it comes to flavor here but the meat is always very well cooked.. Must go spicy!",

    "text": "I've put off writing a review of Taj for a few months because, dang, the staff was SO kind and nice. I just couldn't say mean things.  But dang if this isn't the dullest Indian food in town.  I'm sorry! I'm sorry! I'm sorry! But, DAY-UNG.  We had the buffet and sat in a very pretty booth with light and elegant (and elephant!) art on the walls. No paneer whatsoever was on the buffet, which happens sometimes and is disappointing but fine, but I heard one of the staff explain to a customer that they didn't offer any cheese dishes on the buffet because people wouldn't pay higher price they'd have to charge.  What? How do the other Indian restaurants do it? (I won't name names, but if you're already on the east side of I-15, there's a well known and Yelp-adored Indian restaurant that has made a point to always serve a paneer dish on buffet, and not just the same old sag paneer, either.)  I see the restaurant is highly rated by many others, and I'm genuinely happy for those diners and the restaurant alike, but my plate of miserable chickpeas and other tasteless vegetables (when Indian food is normally outstanding for vegetarians) said otherwise. Believe me, I'd LOVE to have a reason to visit this shopping center more often (as it's also the home of the super-fun Popped), but what I tasted was so dull that at least four other Indian restaurants in this valley would have to go out of business before I'd give Taj another chance.  Maybe it's better if you order off the menu? Or if you are timid about Indian food? Or if you haven't had a wide variety of Indian food? Or if you're unwilling to leave Henderson? Or if you aren't a vegetarian? (My husband would disagree, but maybe his just-as-tasteless experience was a one-off?) I don't know. I guess I just wanted to break my silence and say, listen, if Taj Palace ends up being your first Indian dining experience and you don't like it, please don't write off the cuisine until you give somewhere else a chance. I've had more zing! and finesse come out of a foil packet.",

We loved the Menu with all the many items not found in every Indian restaurant.  I love hot, spicy Vindaloo sauce, which was cooked to perfection in their Lamb Vindaloo.  My husband had the Lamb Madras, not quite so hot, also cooked to perfection.  The accompaniments of Basmati rice and Naan bread, along with delicious Mango Chutney and cool, refreshing cucumber Raita more than our expectations.  The service was great and the ambiance as well.  The best part was, we had leftovers for lunch the next day! Next we will try their lunch Buffet. We will highly recommend it to all lovers of Indian Cuisine as well as novices who want to try something to really treat their palate, especially lovers of spicy, hot food, like myself.  Their offer of Dine-In and Carry-Out, as well as Catering makes it complete!",

The buffet is awesome and comes with your choice of traditional or garlic naan bread.  This is a haven for any vegetarian looking to experience great flavor as there are many vegetarian dishes to choose from. Also for non-vegetarians you can enjoy the delightful scrumptious chicken dishes prepared by Chef Jaipal as well as the vegetarian dishes.  If you like goat the buffet includes a wonderful goat curry. When ordering off the menu I recommend the lamb or chicken  Vindaloo or the lamb and chicken Haryali, but everything on the menu is delicious.  If you try the buffet keep in mind  that the heat factor is at a level 5 from 1-10. When I order off the menu I like it spicy so I usually go between 7-8.  Also the service is impeccable; every one is friendly and every now and then Chef Jaipal will come out and say hello.  If you love Indian food, this is definitely the place to go!",

    "text": "I was really hesitant reviewing an indian restaurant. Since living in LV for 3 years I had pretty much resigned myself to the idea that indian restaurants were just mediocre. Taj Palace completely changed my idea and I think it's the best place for real (i.e. not covered in oil and cream) indian food. My hubby and I have been here a few times, and even brought other friends out here who loved it! Firstly, the food is really fresh which is important. The pieces of meat they serve are big cubes, the flavors are bold and remind me of how my family cooks. We've tried their lunch buffet which has a really big variety of veg and non-veg food, I love that they bring fresh naan to your table! I have to say that we tried their veg samosa  and it was one of the best we've ever had, crispy on the outside and piping hot on the inside. I think i even dreamed about their mango lassi, it's so good. We've tried a variety of their chicken dishes and while they do an amazing murgh makani (butter chicken) last night we tried their chicken kadai (chicken with green peppers and onions) and my hubby LOVED it! I was craving aloo parantha (a bread stuffed with potatoes and peas)  and saag paneer (spinach and cheese cubes) and it blew me away. In fact, the food is even better the next day!  The service is amazing, and everyone is really nice. They remember us from previous visits and that makes it more special when we eat there. Unlike other indian restaurants where we've waited 10-15 minutes to even get water, here they serve you drinks immediately. Also, I would give them an extra star because they are one of the few indian places that serve ras malai which is hands down my favorite dessert in the world. And it was soft and perfect and delicious, I didn't even share it! All in all, we'll be regulars here for a long time!",

Unlike some ethnic restaurants the Taj is beautifully decorated, low lighting enhances a feeling of privacy, booths around the walls and table in the center.  The restaurant  is halal, so don't come expecting to order a pint of Kingfisher.  We started with the vegetable samosas, which were perfectly spiced, and delicious.  They could have used a sauce, but that wasn't the presentation. For our main courses we had the rogan josh, a carefully spiced lamb stew, chicken tikka masala, and gobi alou, a cauliflower and potato dish, also beautifully spiced and perfectly cooked.  The vegetables were just barely cooked through, still firm and faintly crisp.  The two meat courses were a little disappointing but we have to take some of the blame.  We ordered them a 5 on a scale of 10 for spice and we could easily have done 9 or 10.  The rogan josh especially cried out for more flavor, though again the lamb was perfectly cooked, the chunks just beginning to fall apart.  The chicken spice was brick red and delicious.  We'll be back.",

We had a tikka masala, lamb rojan josh, and the mattar paneer. Each dish was cooked to perfection and had its own flavor profile, like it's supposed to. So many curry houses seem to have a one size fits all base sauce, which ruins the food. Thankfully, this is not the case at Taj. The portions were generous in both size and with meat content. Though it was a little at the high end for a curry house, I do feel as though I got my money's worth.  They are still waiting on their booze license, so at this time, no beer or wine yet. I can't wait to go back and try some more of their yummy curries!",

I have to admit while it was tasty, it wasn't anything I was in love with.  We found this place because it is across the street from our apartment complex.  Price-wise, it's a bit expensive, but the dishes are amazing.  My first dish was the Mango Lamb Curry (mild spice level, mind you). Delicious.  The lamb is tender with just a bit of fat and tendon to make it just that more yummy, but not make me feel guiltyl for eating that extra stuff. My significant other ordered a Paneer dish. Also delicious.  A few weeks after we went there, he discovered that Taj Palace had a lunch buffet for only $10.  Yay!  All their dishes were scrumptious. During the lunch buffet, I tried the Goat Curry, some vegetarian platters, and their Peas Pillau.  The goat in the goat curry was as wonderful as the lamb in the lamb curry.  Their vegetarian platters were all delicious and the Peas Pillau was gastronomically pleasing.  We have made several trips back to Taj Palace and will probably be making more! Oh! And one can't go to an Indian restaurant without ordering Naan!",

The staff was very kind and accommodating, and even created a special Saag Aloo (spinach and potato) dish as opposed to the normal spinach and cheese dish that a vegan like me couldn't enjoy. We've been there many times for both dinner and the lunch buffet and  the food never falters in its flavor and freshness. Our favorite dishes include the Dal Basanti, garlic naan, mixed vegetable appetizer, and the Gobi Aloo. Overall: Beautiful interior, nice staff, delicious food... just go eat there. Just go.",

The place was nicely decorated for a strip mall restaurant and the staff seemed friendly and welcoming.  Nehil was our waiter and the experience we had with him garnered Taj Palace this one star review.  Another couple came in after we did and Nehil spent 10 minutes chatting with the couple at the next booth, talking about himself.  When he did stop by to take our order I told him that I wanted the Vegetarian Appetizer Platter and he said \"you don't want to order that, that's going to fill you up and you won't eat the entree.\"  I then ordered a potato filled bread and he said \"you don't want to order that, take the garlic naan\"  as if he wants to tell me what to eat.  I deferred to my Husband who wanted the half tandoori chicken and Nehil said to him \"you don't want to order that, take the fish entree\".  I asked to speak to a manager and he said none was available.  I then asked for a business card and the name of the owner and as we were leaving a group of men entered through the back door.  I spoke to one of them and told them about our experience and they just stood there dumbfounded.  We left and had a wonderful $75 dinner somewhere else.  Too bad Taj Palace - you lost our business forever.  The quote for this place is \"Guest is as good as God\".  I think not.",

    "text": "Let me be straight, I love Indian food. What's better than sopping up all that extra sauce with tender naan bread? You really can't go wrong.  We haven't had the pleasure of a  Indian restaurant close to home, so when a friend of our invited us to Taj Palace for dinner it was a no brainer! The decor is subtly lit, and classic Indian culture. Pretty much what I would expect walking into an Indian restaurant. I was quite excited to see the discount for check-in on Yelp! The screams \"Smart\" business to me!  Our server's name was Vick and he was a class act! He made some really amazing recommendations. The most unexpected and easily most refreshing was a yogurt based mango drink (non-alcoholic). If you don't do alcohol this is a MUST! It was subtly sweet, enchancing the earthy flavor of the mango while wrapping you up in all that yogurt creaminess. I don't even like mango and I was in love.The wine list was pretty limited, but I can't say I was expecting a cellar list to be presented. The Pinot Noir I ordered was pleasing, but pinot's a typically easy drinking wines.  We started with a lamb samosa & chili paneer. Both were presented quickly, and were delicious.  I wish that I could remember, pronounce or even spell some of the Indian names of the dishes we ate....but alas, I cannot. I know, lame! I had the non-veg combo platter. It included Chicken-Tikka Masala - Butter Chicken - Chicken Curry - Dal - Riata - Naan - Rice - Rice Pudding. I went with a level 4 on my food. I like the spice, but want to taste the flavor. My husband tried the Shrimp Curry at a level 7.  The Butter Chicken at Taj Palace is nothing short of incredible. Don't get me wrong, everything was delicious, and I have few complaints. As I write this review however, my palette is overcome with the savory lingering of the butter chicken sauce. YUM! Vick, our server, actually had the Chef make me an additional portion to take home for Naan dipping! What an awesome guy, he's an A+ in my book!  My husband's dish was SPICY, and rightfully so - it was a 7! The shrimp was perfectly cooked and saucy. My only complaint was that his Garlic Naan was quite burnt around the edges. This was disappointing, as I had read many reviews about how great the garlic naan was. Oh well, maybe next time.  And that's where I'll leave you my Yelp friends. There will indeed be a next time. Taj Palace was delicious. The atmosphere was comfortable and classy. The service was on point and attentive. Give Taj Palace a try, your tummy will thank you!",

    "text": "Been wanting to try Taj Palace for a while since it's the closest Indian restaurant to my house and I'm obsessed with both Samosa Factory and Mt Everest from my work lunch breaks.  Even though it averages 4 stars here on Yelp, there was always something about the reviews that made me a little tentative.   Well, that and the non buffet prices.  What is it about Indian restaurants and their dinner prices?  They always seem about $3-$4 more expensive per entree than I expect.  Compared to most of their lunch buffet or lunch special bargains, it drives me a little crazy to go to one for dinner and get much less food for a lot more money.  This type of thinking is why my pants I just picked up from Men's Wearhouse barely fit, but I digress.  I ordered the Veggie Samosas which is one of my standards I judge any indian restaurant on, some plain naan, and goat curry spicy 7 out of 10 (love this scale!).  I asked if the curry came with rice, and I was told no, but that I could do a combo of 1/2 rice and 1 naan.  Sure, sounds like exactly what I need.  When I arrived, my total bill was $29.  Now the curry was $16 and the Samosas were $5 (according to their website) so I guess the naan and rice cost $7 or so? (shrug)  Started with the curry over the rice first.   The curry had a nice flavor, it was thick, smoky, and the spice level was perfect.  On top of the rice or being sopped up with the naan (the naan was about what I expect, which is a good thing), either way made me happy.   The goat was tasty, but there were a LOT of bones and pieces of fat and cartilage throughout which was a bit of a buzzkill. It was rare to be able to get a bite of meat without having to constantly spit out a small chunk of something (best visual ever, I know).   I actually would have ultimately preferred it with JUST the curry sauce by the end of my plate.  The samosas were very large and perfectly shaped with a great flaky crust.  Honestly it almost seemed a little too perfectly made which had me wondering if it was homemade or not (I have no way of knowing honestly, it's quite possible it is).  They tasted fine on the inside, but I found the outside to be overly salt or peppered or both.  I'd honestly never had a samosa with so much seasoning on the outside of it, and my fingers were covered in spice whenever I'd pick it up to eat it which I wasn't used to..   The green sauce it came with was good, wasn't so much a fan of the red.  Overall a good version, though I prefer Factory's or Mt Everest's.  Final conclusion is that I enjoyed my meal overall, though I wouldn't exactly say it was worth the price I paid in total.   I did get leftovers out of it which softened the blow a little.  I think I'll stick with Samosa Factory and Mt Everest to satisfy my Indian cravings, though if I'm ever in a dire need for some curry in Henderson (it happens.  It definitely happens) Taj Palace warrants some consideration.",

The garlic naan was delicious.. The samosas were great and I can't say one bad thing about all the entrees I had.  I tried the chicken tiki masala, goat curry, and another spicy chicken dish I can't remember the name of.  All here cooked and spiced perfectly.  The spinach saag was perfect.  Only downfall of buffets is you can't adjust spice level. I like it face melting hot but I totally understand why they have to make it mild.  I'll defiantly be coming back to try the rest of the menu.",

I've only been to the lunch buffet, which is very reasonably priced at like $11 per person.  You have a choice of fresh naan-regular or garlic.  My favorite is the garlic naan.  My favorite items are the chicken tikki massala, saag paneer, tandoori chicken, basmati Rice, and some other items I can't remember the names but are also yummy.

Admittedly my very first Indian food dining experience was some time last year and I failed to yelp about it *insert hand slap here*, but that only means I will have to revisit the eatery (drumming up repeat business) and yelp about it then.  Back to Taj Palace: YUM!  Last night was my second time dining here and it was equally as delightful as the first time. Excellent service, not a glass gone empty all night, food seasoned to perfection and plenty of left overs to enjoy today.   My only gripe menu item gripes were regarding the appetizers, Paneer Pakora and the Fish Pakora; both were extremely dry and virtually flavorless.   All in all, stellar service (the place is rarely packed), delicious eats (if you steer clear of the fried appetizers), distinguishable meats (white meat chicken used, yey!), and delicious flavors will have me and my friends coming back for more.",

It was very busy when we came on a weekday, and they were able to accommodate our large group of 12 at neighboring tables. We ordered garlic naan (included!), and it took a little while, but still got it fresh and hot to eat with our 2nd plate. I'd recommend ordering this as soon as you get a table so they can get it started. It's also a plus that it doesn't sit out in the buffet and get soggy. My favorite things here are the vegetarian samosas, chicken tikka masala, tandoori chicken, and garlic naan. All the other curries are delicious too! I wish the dessert side of the buffet was as good, but we were too full anyway.",

We stopped here for our dinner.  The Paneer Tikka Masala was good, but $15 for it is pricey especially because there wasn't much of paneer in it. Which is why the 1/2 star goes.

I'm pretty sure prison Indian food would've been better. Good thing it was only $11.95.  Then they charged me for 2 people when it was just 1. Like um  Hello do you see anyone sitting with me.

Still tasty though. Sadly, the service was really slow, and the food took forever to come out, even though the restaurant wasn't that busy. The server never informed us of why there was such a delay. They can definitely work on their service.  Got a free mango lassi for the yelp check in so that was nice.  Will I be back? I don't know.

Also, we found small bones and/or cartilage in two of our dishes. And our friend who got the vegetarian biryani was put off. I hate to give them two stars as maybe they just had an off night?",

So the next question was can I bring my own cauliflower rice since it is not offer in your restaurant. The man responded with \"NO I CANNOT ALLOW THAT\" . What? Seriously? It made me feel bad and now I don't even want to eat there or recommend this place ever! I have been to other restaurants and they let me bring my own rice since they are not offering what I needed. I just wish they considered or maybe adding cauliflower rice on their menu to cater to people on keto",

Upon arriving, we were a bit concerned because it was pretty much empty despite how big the interior is. We liked how clean it looked so we opted to stay and we are super glad we did!  So first thing is first.... not much goes better with spicy food than ice cold beers. And we were pleased to see that there was a pretty sizable selection including Indian varieties as well. Only thing that goes almost as well with spicy Indian is the mango lassi which we were please to find upon checking in on Yelp that we were entitled to one complimentary. It was creamy, tangy and delicious!  We were starving when we arrived so we quickly ordered a couple of appetizers while we pondered the menu. We ordered samosas as well as curry mussels. The samosas were a bit dry so we weren't crazy about them however the curry mussels were spectacular!   For our entrees we opted for both the tikka masala as well as the vindaloo. Oh and of course some garlic naan. Both were delicious and warmed us from the inside out.  Decent size portion so we even left with extra for lunch the next day!",

First with the positives. The service was excellent. They were very attentive and professional.  Also the mango lassi was very yummy. Then came the veggie samosas , flaky piping hot and delicious... But they had put a seasoning on it that was salty ... Which I found odd.  Then the chicken tikka masala was so salty I only could eat so much...this was the same with the lamb korma.  The lamb itself was at least cooked well. Often places can make it to chewy. They are killing the magic of their food with all the extra salt though.  This seems to be a common issue lately at the indian spots I used to like. I would say its more like 2.5 stars, but i couldn't give it three since I really dont see myself going back.  I took the left overs home not wanting to waste them.  I hope i can figure out how to dial down the salt levels.",

They have so many good selections that I wasn't able to decide what the heck I wanted. I ended up just asking my waiter what his favorite thing was. He gave a few suggestions, some of which he said were the chefs specialties. I ended up getting one of the lamb dishes he suggested and I honestly don't even remember what it was called. All I know is that it was delicious! I got the spicy level 6, which was just right! It came with a side of perfectly cooked rice and we ended up ordering some naan. Garlic-y goodness!!!!

The gentleman who took my order was very polite and made sure to get all of our details correct.  He recommended the rice with raisins and cashew, which was not to be missed!  It totally made the meal.  Everything in the vegetarian appetizer platter was still crispy, not soggy like I expected from my usual delivery experiences.  The portions were generous but not too much to finish.  We will definitely be repeat customers to this fabulous gem of a restaurant.  Maybe next time we will dine in for the full experience.  Thank you for the yumminess!!",

After answering that we had not, he asked what Indian dishes we enjoyed and recommended some very yummy items on the menu.  We ended up getting LAMB DO-PIAZA, CHICKEN TIKKA MASALA, GARLIC NAAN, PEAS PILLAU, and 2 FLYING HORSE ROYAL LAGERs.  Everything was very tasty and full of rich flavor.

Well, it was simply wonderful and amazing and delish and oh so perfect.  I came here solo for lunch two days ago for the first time and found the place to be a hidden gem (to me, maybe not to others).  I'm sure the options might change daily for the buffet, but the first two things I tried were the only two things I ate - because they were that good.  The lentils with rice and the chicken tikka masala - can't go wrong.  For some reason I just wasn't in the mood for lamb, but it looked very good.  This place is good and you can't beat the lunch buffet price and food!",

We took advantage of the lunch buffet and could not even speak to one another because that would take away from the flavors of the food. The wait staff were wonderful and so pleasant and helpful to us.  We came a second time a month later and usually that is the ultimate test for a place to see if it lives up to the first impression, and my goodness it did! The whole table was drooling over it and could not stop eating. The smells, the flavors, the quality of each dish was beyond expectation.   Thank you Taj Palace, we loved every bite!",

(Maybe I'm just used to Asian buffets or AYCE sushi joints where there is an abundance of items and made-to-order quality, respectively. Or casino places, even.)   We arrived during the last hour, so perhaps that affected it, but the food looked slightly unappetizing to me sitting under the heat lamps.   They serve the naan fresh, though. We got a basket of the garlic variety, and it came out hot and soft - perfect! We were promptly served waters and the setting was clean, and aptly decorated. I asked about the yelp check-in for the free mango lassi, but I guess it's only valid during dinner. (My mistake though, it's stated clearly on the offer.)  My favorite were the SAMOSAS! They're huge. Very filling and I could see the flaky layers. I also had some basmati rice and saag. My boyfriend tried the lemon rice and the chicken tikka masala, which he said was a little too spicy for him. I tried it and I think it was just the amount of spices and seasonings he didn't like.   For dessert, they had this rice pudding and a few fruits. Watermelon was great on a hot day like this, but again, not too much selection.  I'm sure dinner is a different story, but I probably won't come back to an Indian buffet again.",

I feel like the servers do a great job of reading the customers, they aren't constantly bothering your conversations but they do ensure that you have everything you need.

You definitely get more of a bang for your buck if you do the buffet option, however if you like your food spicy like I do, I would recommend waiting until dinner.  My faves are their samosas and the saag. Stop by if you're in the area!",

We decided to give Taj another try from the first time last year when we'd just moved to the Vegas area, we sampled the buffet and was not super impressed. Last night our general regard for Taj was won over.  We arrived around 6:30 on a Thursday night and were promptly seated in a large booth. First, I noticed the Indian decor, lots of gold and jeweled tones, elephants and tree of life, glass lanterns overhead, very nice ambiance. Bollywood videos play on the tv over by the bar (beer and wine), which is always fun and entertaining to watch.  We ordered veggie samosas (the best I've ever had, curried potatoes inside were delicious!), tandoori chicken (it looked dry I thought, but my hubby said it was juicy and delicious), chicken tikka masala (very good, more cinnamon or something than I've had before, but still excellent), chicken vindaloo (my hubby said it was good, but he wished he'd gotten it a little more mild, he asked for a medium to hot), garlic naan (nirvana), rice, and a green salad (simple with lettuce, cucumbers, tomatoes, onions). We stuffed our faces and waddled out happily. I'll definitely go back to Taj now, the dinner is much better than the buffet, as is with most buffets, yes?",

In other words, $20 for a pretty good but not---by a long stretch---phenomenal entree, at Indian restaurant?!    In almost any other city in America a meal like that would be: (a) better, (b) bigger, and (c) around $13 plus tax and tip.  Absolute madness.

As we poured over the menu, we waffled back and forth as to what we should order. The waiter came by and told us \"First order a drink and I'll come back.\" I felt like it was a command, not a suggestion! Neither of us cared to drink, so we stuck with water.  It's not cheap so we decided on an appetizer sampler and an entree to share.   Non-Vegetarian Sampler: $13 2 pieces of Chicken Samosa: Unidentifiable orange-colored paste and peas. Flavorless and boring.  3 pieces of Chicken Pakora: overcooked and tough.  5 pieces of Onion Bahjji: mostly batter but tasty.  Mushroom Matar Curry: $12 About 2 cups of a mushroom sauce. Good, but nothing to write home about.  When we ordered, the waiter began to ask Robin what rice he wanted with his curry and what type of naan we'd like. The waiter said we'd be getting some sort of rice with peas in it and asked whether we wanted regular or garlic. I stopped the waiter and said, \"Wait a second, does this come with the meal or is this extra?\" He replied, \"Everything is extra.\" We said no to rice.  The waiter brought out the naan. 1 piece. ONE piece of naan cut into 4 pieces. $3.50. Really?! REALLY?! What a rip off. When our basket of one piece of naan was empty, the waiter said he'd get us more bread. For $3.50, a reasonable person would assume that meant that the waiter was getting a refill of the bread and they just bring out more when you're done. Nope. \"I'll get you more bread\" and taking away the basket means charging another $3.50 to the bill for another piece of naan that is cut into 4 pieces. Waiters shouldn't \"refill\" things when they are charging for the refill without disclosing that information first.  I had the Yelp check in offer. \"$5 off a purchase of $35 or more.\" I showed the offer to the waiter and he clicked \"used\" and didn't add it to our bill. You know why? Because our 1 entree, 1 appetizer and 2 pieces of bread came out to... $34.59. No discount. I wish he would have told us that our bill was just shy of $35 before he clicked \"used\" on my offer.   If you want to have a bunch of stuff ordered ala cart that you thought was part of your meal, come here. Very quick to word things in such a way as to convey items come with the meal when they're ala cart and overpriced.   The waiter ended the night by saying, \"Was it your first time here?\" We said, \"Yes\" and he responded, \"I could tell because you two didn't order much food.\" Wow. Rude. Maybe if your prices weren't a joke, we would have.   No bueno.",

However, last night I got a Chicken madras and a Garlic nan for takeout - 20$... That's a bit on the expensive side.   But my biggest issue was the madras was inedible.... I'm guessing the chef knocked the salt shaker over and it went into the pan.... It was terrible and I could only eat 2 mouthfuls.   As it was a takeout, I couldn't be bothered to go all the way back and complain/get a fresh dish.   I probably won't eat here again... I'll make the extra effort and go to either India palace or Mount Everest.",

Of course I would have very different choices if I am in San Diego or other areas. For Las Vegas, I think this one deserve a 4 stars.  Would probably be 3 if I am in CA.  $14 is the cost of lunch buffet plus tips.",

The buffet was better stocked and better quality than my previous Indian food go to for lunch.   Inside we were quickly greeted and seated. A couple of servers took care of us. Both were friendly and attentive. One of our servers was very sweet to my baby, stopping to pay her attention each time he'd check on us.  We arrived immediately after opening at 11am and the entire buffet was already set up with everything out. I loved that they were ready to go and we didn't have to wait for any of our favorites.  The buffet had a truly impressive selection. All of my favorites were on the buffet plus some items that were new to me. The buffet starts with a choice of regular or garlic naan that is brought to the table. On the buffet there are two sections of entree items, rices, and samosas. Proteins include chicken, lamb, and goat. There were quite a few tasty vegetarian dishes too. The last section of the buffet has a salad bar, chutneys, and some desserts. Every item had a clear label.   All of the food I tasted was delicious! Butter Chicken and Chicken Tikka Masala are my favorites. The garlic naan was fluffy and warm with the perfect amount of garlic. What really surprised me was how much I loved the couple of vegetarian dishes I tried. Sauces and chutneys didn't disappoint. I love sweets so the gulab jamun made me happy as an ending to my meal.   The lunch buffet is a great bang for your buck at around $11 or $12 per person.",

Favorite dishes here are the goat curry and biryani, and I always get the garlic naan. I like that I can bring almost anyone here because the buffet is consistently well stocked with a variety for various diets, including pescatarian (fish korma) and vegan (several choices).

When the bill came they charged me $5.00. I didn't even bother making a fuss over it cuz it's not worth it. Just know I wouldn't come back or recommend this.  Anyhow for appetizers we started off with the chicken soup and veggie pakoras. The soup was okay super spicy and the pakoras were not your typical pakoras. They weren't very crispy and didn't taste good at all. We didn't even finish this dish.  We also order plain naan, butter chicken and it comes with rice.   The naan was overly buttered and didn't even really taste like naan that I'm use to having. The butter chicken was blah, the chicken pieces were cut small but they weren't good. For dessert we ordered Gulab jaman and kulfi. Kulfi was okay and the Gulab jaman is definitely canned Gulab jaman warmed up.  Service was good by only one person the older, short bulky gentleman. He was very sweet.  I didn't get a good vibe from this place. Rice doesn't seem fresh either.. I'm surprised it's rated 4 stars it definitely isn't in my books.  I've had way better Indian food definitely wouldn't come back.",

First, you check in and get a free mango lassi - mango and like yogurt mixed to form a delicious, creamy drink. It's like dessert before the main course. My friend ordered 2 more in addition to the free one.  Peruse thru the menu and there is sure to be something for everyone as you munch on there delicious crackers and sauces.   I ordered Karahi Paneer which was tomato, garlic, ginger, bell peppers in a tomato sauce, spice level was 4. Perfect choice as I was not in the mood to feel the heat, just a kick. I also ordered garlic naan, my friend ordered food and rice came with it. We couldn't tell who's rice it was, so we shared and it paired nicely with the paneer.   This was definitely a \"treat yo self' meal, but it was well worth it! Each time I come here, I had the same guy. Any questions you have about the menu, he is sure to answer them  They have a buffet, of which I haven't taken part in, however, I hear it's really good a reasonably priced.",

I always get the classic chicken tikka masala, garlic naan, vegetable samosa, and the mango lassi. (The mango lassi is extremely addicting btw so BEWARE).

The Yelp check-in offer was a glass of mango lassi; it was flavorful and you could definitely taste the mango.  The buffet was a bit small but all of the food was tasty and relatively fresh. The garlic naan was also made fresh and they didn't skimp on the garlic.  I personally prefer slightly crispier naan and would have liked even more variety in dishes or maybe some more unique dishes, but for the price no major complaints.  Definitely recommend Taj Palace for Indian food! I will have to try their dinner menu sometime.",

Located at the busy shopping center on Eastern Ave between Silverado Ranch and Richmar there is plenty of parking. We arrived just after opening at 11:00 AM and it was already pretty busy. We were quickly greeted and seated and asked for our drink order and what type of naan we wanted and chose the garlic.   The lunch buffet is from 11-3 daily and is reasonably priced at only $12 including unlimited naan and rice pudding or fruit for dessert. The buffet is set up in 3 stations. The first station has starters of rice, samosas, cabbage and a few vegetarian dishes. The second station offers mostly chicken dishes like tandoori and tikka masala as well as lamb korma. The last station is a salad bar and the two dessert options.   The definite highlights of the buffet are the samosas and tandoori chicken. The samosas had plenty of filling, the perfect amount of spice and were nice and crispy. The tandoori chicken was excellent as well with lots of flavor although it does stain your fingers. The garlic naan was also delicious with lots of garlic, butter and spices. After we finished our first order they quickly brought out a second one. As far as the chicken tikka masala it was a let down. Really dry chunks of chicken and the sauce was quite bland. The other dishes we tried were pretty good, lots of flavor as is expected with Indian cuisine.   The service at lunch was excellent. Drinks were constantly refilled, staff came by twice to check on us and make sure we liked the food and as mentioned a second order of naan was brought out quickly. I am really happy we tried Taj Palace and will definitely be returning soon!",

We came in for the lunch buffet and although there was not a lot in the way of selection but the quality was DELICIOUS!  My hubby said it was probably the best Indian food he has ever had!   Definitely coming back whenever we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "So I'm a huge fan of Indian food. It's one of my go-to's when I can pick whatever I want which isn't always a thing when you've got a family.  Anyway I have come to really love Taj Palace.  I am about as picky about this style of food as I am about great sushi or a great stake house experience. Some things require a specific kind of authenticity and Indian really require that they hit the flavor notes and hit them right.  These guys are a local favorite.   They do an excellent job on every dish I love and they are close enough to my house for it to be the best thing going in this part of town. They compare very favorably to Mint or MtEverest who are my faves in other parts of town and the IMO the best outside of when I worked in the Bay Area.   For the south of the 215 these guys are solid day in and out. My experiences have mostly been take out or dine in and I have not hit the lunch buffet, but I'm betting it's good.   Overall my standouts are a Saag that is tasty and delicate in its flavor. An awesome and consistently solid Korma. A really great Biryani. The samosa is crispy and thin pastry stuffed with well seasoned veggies and always a winner. The Butter Chicken is creamy and delicious as is their Masala. I have ordered all these dishes in both meat or veggie version and have never been unhappy.  They also have a great tandoori chicken and naan as well as other more interesting breads with stuffing of various kinds.   Keep it up guys.  You're doing God's work. At least you constantly keep me happy and coming back.   ;-)  I have been eating here about monthly if not more often for the last 4-5 years. Most recent was last night.",

Lately it feels like the staff are rude and have an attitude. A few of the waiters just give me a bad vibe. You have to beg for them to refill your water glass or give you ice. Always takes forever to get the check. I'm only speaking on the lunch staff...we've not been here much for dinner. It's a convenient location for us and we love Indian food but I think we will be visiting the other Indian restaurants in Vegas where they are nicer and don't make us feel uncomfortable.",

The venue is neat & clean, quite attractively and atmospherically appointed, more than enough for a cozy dinner. The buffet held many of the choices one would expect. I tried out the veggie samosas, chili chicken, tandoori chicken, butter chicken, salad, several other items. All good. The chili chicken was plenty spicy, yum! The garlic naan was prompt, warm and soft. I enjoyed a bit of kheer, but didn't partake in the other sweets such as gulab jamun or the (Yelp check-in) mango lassi. The owner, Smeet, quite personable, table-touched with a bit of convo to ensure I was having a positive experience. The buffet cashed out at $12.95 before tax, tip and beverage. The location is convenient, a bit south of 215 & Eastern. I'm sure to return ... and soon.",

Food: 4  The buffet included staples like tandoori chicken, chicken korma, chicken tikka masala, and saag. It also included other interesting items such as goat curry. Favorites include goat curry, chicken korma, saag, and (of course) naan. The naan was fluffy, crispy, and slathered in butter garlic. You can ask for normal naan, if so desired.  The only dish that I didn't really enjoy was the tandoori chicken. It was too dry and the seasoning was heavy handed and almost bitter.  Service: 5  The servers are super attentive, and they refill your water and clear dirty plates constantly.  Ambiance: 4  This is your typical Indian restaurant in decor. It's in a large plaza, so there aren't any problems finding parking.",

    "text": "As a long time orange county kid and the son of Indian immigrants,  I have a pretty good understanding of quality South Asian cuisine. I've eaten a lot of it from restaurants and I've had it countless times in home cooked meals. Trust me then, when I say that this place is really just ok.  It's well decorated, and the service was alright. We came here for a lunch buffet one time. I did find the garlic naan to be pretty tasty. But in the realm of indian cuisine, this establishment hardly impresses. Its hard for me to put into words exactly, but the flavor, texture, and quality of the ingredients were simply below what I expect from an indian place. Some of the curries were a bit bland. I wasn't particularly impressed by their chicken tikka. The lentils here are are a bit overcooked, and again, just not that good. Don't get me wrong-- its passable and worth trying. I think its a good place to go to for lunch-- indian food isn't something most people eat everyday. But if you want quality south asian food, there are much better places, even here in Vegas. Try the hole in the wall Kabob Corner in Fremont. It may not look impressive but their food tastes much fresher and is much better seasoned.",

My family and I had dinner here last night. We ordered several different naans, rotis, and kulchas. The naans were undercooked and you could pull at the doughy centers. The rotis were too thick and you couldn't tell them apart from the naan. We ordered chicken kadai and butter chicken. Both dishes are rich but the oil floating on top of the chicken kadai was just gross. The chicken pieces in the murgh makani (butter chicken) were strange bits with tiny bones. I was hoping for good quality white chicken breast. We also ordered a shrimp dish but all you could taste was the tomato base. It lacked the spicy kick we were looking forward to. On the other hand, the servers were very polite and friendly. The ambiance could use improvement. I'm all about energy efficient lighting, but the white lights gave the place a cafeteria-like feel.  How much longer do we have to wait before we can get the quality Indian food of cities like Chicago, NY and LA?",

Every item was delicious; the service was also stellar. (It was also the redeeming point of an otherwise wasted day og sightseeing at Hoover Dam.)  As soon as we were seated we they brought 2 dipping sauces (one hot and one sweet) and a basket of papadam, which was crispy and fresh, just like it's supposed to be.  The vegetarian mixed appetizer platter was served piping hot and without a hint of grease.  In addition to the samosa and pakora, it included a lightly battered and fried jalapeno -- fabulous flavor (though not for the meek-hearted).    Portion sizes are generous - in addition to the appetizer we ordered 3 other dishes for a family of four, and had lots of leftovers.  The saag paneer was spicy yet slightly sweet (a stick of cinnamon was the secret to this, I believe); very good. The eggplant was wonderfully complex - tangy yet smoky and rich flavored -- my husband has a new love.  The malai kofta was out of this world.  I was reluctant to order it because it's often boring and doughy, but went along with our waiter's recommendation.  It was the perfect balance to the other dishes, and the flavors almost melted in our mouth.  We also ordered a plain and a garlic naan.  Both arrived piping hot, crispy and delicate.  The rice seemed overpriced for what you get ($4.95 for a heaping bowl) and rather plain.    It'd be remiss if I didn't say a few words about the impeccable service.  The waiter gave us great advice and made every effort to ensure we had a wonderful experience.  He was clearly more interested in happy customers than in an extra $ or 2.  For example, he suggested we order only 1 rice at the outset, not 2.  When we were deliberating over whether to order a mango lassi, he sent some out for us to sample first.  Overall, a terrific meal with great service and great food.",

I will pass on the app platter too, and go straight for the samosas, which were so good.

Cheapest way to experience the variety of foods without ordering the entire entree. Food is okay, but sits out awhile and can get old and crusty. Not a large variety, but it's about the only Indian food place near where I live so I continue to go back. All in all, it is good but I wouldn't go out of your way to visit, just the only place close to me.  Service however is always great. But maybe they could cut down on their price a little more if they didn't have 4 servers per diner.... just sayin.",

We recived complimentary papadum with a spicy mint sauce and the worst tamarind sauce I have ever encountered.  Our entrees were boti kabob masala (lamb chunks in a rich yellow curry) and Murgh madras (boneless chicken in a tomato/cream curry).  In addition, we ordered naan and zeera rice (lightly spiced basmati rice with cumin seeds).  Neither entree scaled any culinary heights though the amount of animal protein in each would likely have caused Hannibal Lechter to rejoice. I felt menu prices, separate charge for plain rice, were on the high side.",

A tandoori chicken leg, a piece of naan, rice, one type of curry would come up to $15-$20 for one person. At Taj Palace, you can have all of that in a lunch buffet for just $11! I'd say that there were about ten different types of curries, give or take, with plenty of options for vegetarians. The garlic naan and the samosas are freaking amazing. However, the buffet ends at 3 PM. The dinner menu generally seems to offer the same foods as the lunch buffet but at a heightened price, so I probably wouldn't come here in the evening.",

This is now my second trip to Taj Palace for their lunch buffet and I'm in love! All their dishes are rich in flavor and oh so good. I have not tried any other places in town so I have nothing to compare to but at this rate who cares, I love having them so close to my house. My first visit there I fell in love with a carrot pudding with it's sweet texture and shredded bits of carrot, it is perfection on my spoon. So I was disappointed that they didn't have it out this time when I came in since I had been craving it for 2 weeks. When the waiter came by to see how our meals were I sadly told him how much I loved their carrot dish and how much I'd been craving it. He smiled and said yes it is good isn't it and walked away. After devouring all their other yummy vegetarian dishes plus the oh so scrumptious, piping hot naan bread, I almost choked back my mouth of food in surprise to see the waiter carrying out a bowl full of my carrot dish to the table!!! I couldn't believe how awesome and attentive he was. That's what I call service ;D at that point I had already overeaten and could not take more than 2 bites so I kindly asked for a take home box ashamed to waste such perfection.  I'm glad my taste buds have finally matured to try the wonderful new cultural flavors I've introduced them too. LOL  I can't wait to go back and I recommend this place to everyone I know!!!!",

We came a half an hour before the lunch buffet ended, I recommend getting there a bit earlier because they seriously start to remove food at three on the dot.   The naan was fresh and delicious, the sweet rice was yummy and the tikka masala was to die for. I could just eat the sauce on rice and live happily ever after. Wonderful cucumber/yogurt sauce and I don't know what kind of crack they put into the rice pudding with slivered nuts but it was addictive. I wanted to take the steam tray full and run out of the door.   Good service besides feeling rushed to finish when it hit three, and we will definitely go here again.",

It was tender and the sauce was delicious! My favorite way to eat Naan is to dip it in curry or dipping it in one of the dishes.  I devoured three baskets of Garlic Naan in no time. Their curry was excellent as well. Great place to satisfy your Indian appetite! Im getting hungry just talking about this place.",

    "text": "Taj Palace is located in an upscale strip mall and had been one of our go-to places for Indian food. Their lunch buffet is $10.95 and one of the better values in town. Their space has a bright and comfortable ambience. They offer a wide selection of vegetarian and meat dishes, some of which you don't typically see at other Indian buffets. I do wish they offered Butter Chicken instead of Chicken Tikka Masala because dark meat is more tender and tasty than white meat. They also include unlimited, fresh-baked plain or garlic naan with your lunch. For dessert, they usually offer kheer (rice pudding) and sometimes they also have halva. Actually, this is the first place I ever tried halva, and it was delicious.  Service is friendly and generally efficient. On our last visit, I was disappointed by how they handled an incident where I discovered that I was chewing on a small strip of plastic imbedded in their curry. The staff initially denied it was plastic and said it was vegetable fiber. Once it became evident that it was indeed a piece of plastic. He said OMG, grabbed it and ran back into the kitchen. They never apologized or offered us any dispensation, nor did we ask for any.",

    "text": "Last night, in his work-induced coma on his only night off in ages, my husband mumbled something about dinner... \"what are you hungry for?  what have we not eaten in ages?  And then he answered his own question - Indian.   I remembered seeing positive reviews of a place on Eastern and found it on my yelp app, so off we went.    We entered with a bit of hesitation as the restaurant was empty with the exception of two diners... after waiting for what seemed forever, he acknowledged us and invited us to be seated.  I recognized him, but couldn't place his face.  Maybe it was because he handed us menus while talking on a cordless phone and giving the other customers their check...multi-tasking.  Not good for an initial restaurant impression...the husband began to eyeroll me...  But he became more forgiving as the server helped him through the enormous menu -- and we, as usual, overordered...   Vegetable Samosas  Chili Pakoras Tandoori Chicken Chicken Tikka Masala Mango Chicken Shrimp Tikka Dal Saag with Potatoes Zeera rice Raita Chili Garlic Naan  not to mention the complimentary pappadums and chutneys and chilis...  stop it!   Yes, enough food for days...  My concerns that this would be steam table fare were put to rest once things began to arrive on the table.    Favorite dishes:  the vegetable samosas were incredibly flavorful and delicious.  Mango Chicken (even better than the tikka).  The two vegetable dishes, yellow lentils and the spinach were very satisfying, the rice simple and delicious, and the garlic chili naan was spectacular, particularly with the raita.    All in all a very good meal.  Oh, and the server?  It's Jignesh, the former manager / server of Sai India Curry -- our favorite little chaat house near UNLV that zipped up unceremoniously a while back.    Beer (domestic only for now) and wine available.    It's a simple, lovely space with good food and kind service...and the owner is definitely Yelp savvy - he encouraged us a to write a yelp review as he bid us adieu...",

The buffet had about half and half vegetarian and meat options to choose from. All the meat options were great and nothing was too spicy but packed a lot of flavor. I am giving 4 starts instead of 5 because the service was lacking. It did seem like they do not have assigned staff to certain areas or tables. Multiple people attempted to bring bread, drink refills, or desserts without asking the other staff if we'd already ordered or anything. Also, our last order of garlic naan bread never showed up. For the price of $10.99 lunch buffet, I would definitely go back but probably bring my own drink.",

    "text": "My wife and I took her brother and his wife to this fine Indian restaurant late on a Friday night. Luckily they are open until 10:30 PM. It was the first time we visited this fairly new restaurant. Since my wife's family has never had Indian food before, I wanted them to try some of the more tasty, but safe for beginners Indian dishes which I will discuss in a minute.   We were greeted and seated quickly by warm and friendly people. Before we placed our order I asked for some papad to munch on. They brought out several pieces with two different types of sauces/chutneys that were just delicious.   As an appetizer we ordered four vegetable samosas that were the best I've ever had. I thought I would go out on a limb and ask for one of my favorite Indian dishes, that is always off menu - the ultra delicious and elusive Chicken 65. Our waiter said that he would ask the chef. To my surprise, he returned with a yes; however, the chef needs a day in advance to prepare it. Definitely returning soon just for that dish alone. In lieu of Chicken 65, the chef recommended Chicken Kadai, which turned out to be excellent. On a heat scale of 1-10, I ordered an 8 and it was perfect. It was flavorful and saucy.    In addition, for our main courses we ordered Indian food staples such as Biryani, Chana Masala, and Tandoori Chicken. Biryani can be difficult to make correctly especially if you have eaten a lot homemade Biryani. It was the perfect complement to the other dishes. The portion was ideal since we were all sharing.   The Chana Masala very tasty. The garbanzos were cooked perfectly and over all was very good. . We ordered a whole Tandoori Chicken which is enough for four people. It was brought to us on a sizzling platter. It was moist and scrumptious.    We opted for 3 orders of Naan - garlic, garlic chili, and plain. Perfectly seasoned and made fresh. You just can't eat Indian food without Naan.   I highly recommend the Taj Mango Shake. They are so good, you will need your own because you won't want to share it. One sip and you're hooked. Have it with your meal or as a dessert. Either way, it's a must-have beverage.   I can tell you that I have no need to go anywhere else for Indian food. This is it for me. Anywhere else would only be a gamble. I will be returning to try other dishes and of course I will call ahead to try their Chicken 65. Since everything else was so good, I know that I won't be disappointed",

We live 15 min away and have two young kids so we love takeout. Our first Taj experience we had friends over so my husband went and picked up a big order. He arrived home to find they'd left out an entire entree which was a bummer with house guests. We called and they said they would credit is the next time around. Soooo...New Years we ordered out again, let them know the situation from the previous time, they said they would credit the entree. When I picked up the order I trusted everything was there, drove home to find out they'd again missed an entire entree as well as all of the rice----yes, we had to eat Indian sans rice! So yet again we called and Kahill said to tell them next time and they would credit the entree and rice. Just ordered again last weekend and we got the whole order, double checked, but they didn't want to credit it to us because we didn't tell them on the phone in, my husband urged them to and so they did. I LOVE the food but I guess I would have hoped for a little more than just continuing to credit what we had already paid for, maybe free Naan or a percentage of the bill. Makes me feel a little jaded to come in again, but we can't stay away from the Lamb Chili, Chicken Tikka Masala, and amazing garlic Naan.   Make sure you check your order of you takeout!!!",

The place has a nice decor and a nice smell aside from the food. There was an underlying spicy incense smell. The price was just a little higher than the standard lunch buffet but it was definitely worth it due to higher quality. The service was good, our water glasses were never empty and the server checked on us repeatedly to make sure everything was to our liking. I would definitely recommend.",

    "text": "After a hike yesterday, we stopped here for their lunch buffet.  It was almost empty when we arrived but we must have been a draw because business picked up while we were there.  They brought us ice water and we ordered garlic naan.  In fact, we ordered a second basket of garlic naan before we even started with the first.  It was quite good.  The first part of the buffet had all vegetarian dishes.  Some of the standouts here were the  pakoras, large triangles filled with a spicy mix of vegetables, and the saag.  The saag had excellent flavorings and was very tasty.  I also tried some of the lentils and they were also good.  In the second section, I had some goat curry, chicken tikka masala, and tandoori chicken.  The chicken tikka masala was standard as was the goat curry.  The tandoori chicken was a bit dry.  A couple of things I noted that were different.  There is no silverware on the table.  You pick up utensils at the buffet when you're there or you go back and get if you forget.  I was expecting some kind of MTV India music playing or video,  but they had their TV off which was quite OK.  But instead, we had pop music which just didn't seem to fit the place.  The room is pleasant, service was OK, and the lunch buffet was good.  There are a few standout items as mentioned.  I didn't have dessert, not even kheer, which almost unheard of for me.  The naan filled me up quite nicely along with two plates of food.",

    "text": "For some reason, Las Vegas has always felt a little thin on quality Indian restaurants. I tend to be a harsh grader so I think Taj is a 3-3.5* on the food, but I'm rounding up because there just aren't that many options and IMO the Henderson area is lucky to have Taj Palace.  To me, the standout dishes are the jalfrezi and the haryali, the latter of which I usually get with tilapia. The biryani is also cooked well here. All their lentil dishes I've tried are good (soup, daal makhani, and yellow daal), and I usually have the aloo gobhi and bhindi masala in my rotation of dishes. When I'm feeling like something more on the creamy side, the korma is pretty delectable too.  The lunch buffet is also an excellent value; just be aware that some of the offerings are not as high quality as they are at dinner (especially the tandoori chicken, which isn't nearly as well cooked at the buffet lunch). Given the low cost though, I don't hold this against them. It works the other way too - if you've only done the lunch buffet, know that some items are much higher quality when ordered at dinner.",

    "text": "I've only dined here for the lunch buffet a few times. It's a pretty good deal to sample several Indian dishes for $10.95. You get a choice of fresh, warm, traditional naan or garlic naan with the lunch buffet. A lot of the buffet items are vegetarian, some vegan, several types of curry - (vegetarian, chicken, goat), basmati rice, salad bar, and a few desserts.  I usually stick to the dishes I'm familiar with - tandoori chicken, tikka masala, saag, basmati rice, samosa, etc. but I'm always willing to try new dishes. I tried some potato & cabbage side, rice with almonds and raisins, vegetable curry, chicken curry in a tomato based sauce, etc. This is probably my least descriptive Yelp review. Forgive me. I'm not too familiar with Indian food. I wanted to take pics of the descriptions at the buffet station but I didn't want to be that dorky Yelper who takes pics. Even though I didn't know some of the dishes I was eating, I enjoyed my buffet. I think some of the curries could have been spicier but they were still fine and tasty.   The restaurant is well decorated & charming with the traditional Indian decor & vibrant colors. The service was very attentive & welcoming. I think 4 or 5 different servers helped me. One guy suggested I use two different sauces for my samosa when he saw that I just grabbed it without a sauce. It was a minty sauce and a tamarind glazed sauce?  I was full off 2.5 plates, garlic naan, and kheer for dessert. I'll be back and hopefully I'll remember the names of the dishes I've had. If you happen to know what I had from my weak descriptions & food pics, please educate me. ;)",

    "text": "I'd like to amend my review a little now that I've been back so many times  I've tried the lunch buffet twice in two days. I'm officially hooked! The service is pretty attentive. Vimil (Vick) is very friendly. He makes an extra effort to remember his customers and takes pride in his job. He's remembered my name ever since I paid with a credit card. Him and other staff always keep my water glass quite full, a definite necessity in an Indian restaurant.   We got there by about 2pm and the lunch buffet closes at 3pm. At exactly 3:06pm the server came over and informed us that they were closed and it was time for us to go. I thought this was a little abrupt, but we were mostly finished, so we left.  I really like the varied options depending on the day. The Samosa's were really good, filled with spicy potato. These were a little spicy, but very tasty. I poured a little bit of mint chutney over the top and it was perfect. I actually wished they would have had them the second day. I also really liked the Chicken Tikka Masala, because I love the red sauce that it comes in, perfect for dipping Naan. There was also a white cream based chicken dish that was really tender.  On my first visit I didn't have room to try the Tandoori chicken on the bone. But on my 2nd visit there was Tandoori chicken pieces and they were pretty tender. I like my stuff super saucy, so I dipped my Tandoori chicken in the Raita (spiced yogurt) and it was delicious.  Garlic naan is the way to go. I love me some garlic!! The naan has came out piping hot... super fresh on every visit.   Also on my first trip I brought my vegan friend and she had a lot of options to choose from and was very happy with the selections. I would definitely recommend telling the server if you are vegan because one of the labels above the food was inaccurate. For my second visit I brought two Indian food experts, they both agreed that it was a pretty good buffet, especially for the price. They seemed to enjoy the food, but one of them felt that the dishes could have used a little more spices. Both of them agreed they would rather have the dishes spicier, but realize that with a buffet it's usually going to be mild to medium.    I would definitely like to come back during dinner and try some of the menu items. Although I think I'll have a hard time staying away from this buffet. I love having tons of options and you can't beat the price... about $11 per person.",

Friend of mine also highly recommends the Tandoori Chicken, says it's the best in town!  We also tried the green chili naan and the garlic naan.  We were a little disappointed that the green chili one was not as spicy as it was advertised, but the garlic naan surely made up for it!

    "text": "Great little Indian joint tucked away in one of the many plaza and business centers on Eastern. This one in particular you can find in the same plaza at BJs!  I met up with some friends here for lunch on the weekend to take advantage of their AYCE buffet. We got there around 1pm on a Saturday and there was ample seating despite the restaurant itself being pretty tiny. But hey, not complaining! (I hate waiting, but who doesn't?)  Anyway, it's good to note that the buffet is only available for lunch and dinner menu becomes ala carte style so if you want to indulge in the buffet like me, come during lunch hours which I believe are until 3pm.   Onto the juicy stuff, the food! It's not a huge selection but it was pretty tasty. The first section by the plates are the vegetarian entrees and that includes samosas! I love samosas and these were great. I had to force myself not to grab more than one each time I went back for another round. I also enjoyed the coconut curry chicken and the tikka masala. I was a little bummed not to see any lamb dishes or butter chicken but you can't win them all. You also get naan for the table and we opted for garlic naan. Came out fresh and hot!  And one of the most surprising parts of the meal was the check! The lunch buffet costs a whopping $11. I don't know about you, but that's a steal for me.  Lots of parking throughout the plaza is available as well so nothing much else to report on that front.",

    "text": "Now, I love Indian food and basically will order it every where I travel to because I always get a craving for it.  I had been thinking about Taj Palace for some time now and finally got the family to try it out.....  a.  Ambiance - strip mall setting, plenty of seating arrangements and for various size. Perhaps you can fit up to about 85 people, so it was decent size.  Good lighting, nice bar, buffet area, tables and booths.  I say 4 star.  b.  Service - It was not busy, so we got pretty darn good service from everyone there. Although it seemed to take like forever for the food to come out and the natives were getting a bit restless.  4 star  c.  Food -3 star  a.  Chicken Tikka Marsala - OK, so this is really an English invented Indian dish and not popular in India.  I get it. Just like Chop Suey and Fortune cookies in Chinese cooking, these were things invented not in the original country.  I get it.  But man was this dish uninspired!!!!!!!  The chicken was cut in huge cubes.  The best way to slice is to take the breasts and cut at angles to get thin against the grain meat that when cooked, produce an aromatic and tender chicken.  Eating these chunks, was like eating chunks.  We asked for 2 out of 10 spice due to the kids and this thing was more spicy than the 5/10 spice I ordered for the Lamb.  2 Star  b.  Lamb Bhuna - i was a looking for the Lamb Roghan Josh.  The spice was mild, perhaps they messed this up with the miles Tikka I ordered?  The lamb was a bit tough, however the gravy sauce was awesome and quite tasty.  I give this a 3 star.  Great taste, terrible texture.  c.  Garlic Naan - Kids loved it, we had to order another servicing.  4 star  d. Tandoori Chicken - Hmmm good color, bit dry, on a bed of peppers, very tasty, if not overly cooked.  2 star.  To me, a family of four and it cost about 85.00 including tip. Way too expensive and not enough to warrant a return visit.  1 Star.",

Rice comes separate, but it is very nicely done. For dessert we shared the mango ice cream. It had really awesome flavor, not like any ice cream I've tasted before. Ambiance is pleasant. They've got some pretty good decor. The best part is the Indian pop they play and the accompanying music video. I wish I understood what they were saying as it looked spectacular. Definitely didn't feel pushed out after we were done. They let us chill for a bit afterward. FYI bathroom (single use) was clean and pleasant smelling. That's important!

I had ordered a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon back in March for this place and forgot about it, so when one of my friends was in town and we were craving Indian food, we of course had to stop. I ordered Mango Curry Chicken and my friend had Lamb Jalfrezi, and of course we added naan and rice to our order. The rice was a recommendation of the server's--one I had never had with peas, white raisins, and nuts. It was quite good, and went well with what we ordered, but I am going to stick to rice without all the extras next time. It was pricey to have that much extra stuff in it when I just want some straight up plain rice.  The Mango Chicken was pretty much sweetened Butter Chicken, but it was delicious. The lamb was a little tough for my liking, but luckily that wasn't my dish! ha ha, sucks to be my friend. But it was minty and delicious and had a nice flavor but was a workout for the teeth.  We went a little overboard our $25 <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> coupon and ended up spending another $25 apiece. That's the danger in those things--you think you're not going to be above the limit and then there you are, paying for stuff you didn't really need ($8 beer, that I will say was good, just not perhaps something I needed to complete the meal).   I will definitely be back--I want to try their buffet as well as their lunch. It was a good dining experience overall, with minor details not upsetting my 5-star experience.",

The tandoori chicken was a little too dry, but thats my only complaint. Taj Palace is one of the few places thats able to keep up with the ridiculous amount of naan I consume. Garlic naan does not cost extra!",

    "text": "Taj palace is pretty much our go-to Indian Lunch place. (We do not work nearby) They are very accomodating of groups large and small, and its a great place to take carnivores, herbivores and omnivores alike. It's also a quick lunch; even though it's a buffet the servers are attentive and friendly. We're never left wondering if we can get the bill so we can go.  I am Chronically Terrible at Spice, so Indian can sometimes be a challenge for me. I know, I suck. I havd been informed. But one of the things I love about Taj Palace's buffet is that they have a variety of heat levels; I can step outside my comfort zone, endure the burn, and them cool down if I bit off more than I can chew. (Pun absolutely intended.)   Plus, their garlic naan is delicious and ever flowing, and all of the different sauces are just meant for being sopped up. My favorite is the goat curry. Yumm",

Only question the server asked \"You ready to order?\"  After not being asked if we'd like something to drink. \"Can I please have a soda and place my offer?\" \"Can I please have a refill?\" \"Can we have a few boxes?\" \"Can we have a bag for the boxes?\" \"Can we have the bill?\"  We literally had to ask for anything and everything we wanted while there were only 6 tables seated, so not busy at all. I watched the servers joking around and staring at all of us while they should have been working.  Oh and did I add that this was on a Saturday night? The busiest night, so if service was like this then imagine any other night?!  The only reason I'd go back is for the garlic naan and Paneer Tikka Masala. If you've got time to kill waiting for everything, check them out.",

I understand what it's like to be in the service industry but there was just no excuse for the way this place was run. Number one we stood there for five minutes waiting to even be greeted, finally got a table and looked over the menu.   We ordered tandoori chicken, goat curry and a side of rice. Oh and a bottle of wine that we never got. Our waiter asked if we wanted our chicken first or with the meal, we asked for it with the meal but guess what? We got it first. The chicken was really good I'll give them that. But the curry? Oh my god. So disgusting. There were chopped up bones in it which was NOT indicated on the menu. I almost threw up. Our waiter never even came back our entire meal. We had to literally flag him down to get our check.   Sooooo disappointed. Would NEVER return here. Seriously wish I could give zero stars.",

I've been to some other places which cost a bit more and they weren't as good as this place.   My favorite dishes are the standard chicken tikka masala, vegetable samosa, garlic naan, basmati rice, and the tandoori chicken. They also have this rice pudding (which reminds me of Horchata) for dessert which is pretty good since it isn't overly sweet.   Service is good overall and the staff is attentive.

So called Samosas were wrapped in filo pastry wrapping and the potato filling inside was stale and smelled funny. So called Goat Curry was Lamb. Chicken curry was bland and tasted like canned tomatoes. And the Naan !!! I had to ask atleast 5 different times before the indifferent waiter would bring it and throw it on the table.. Hey you waiter w the small goatee - go get another job if you don't want to do this !! All in all - this restaurant sucked BIG TIME and does not even deserve one star!! - maybe it's for people who have no idea what Indian food tastes like !!!

    "text": "It makes me happy when I walk into an Indian restaurant and get blasted by aroma of all the various spiced which go into their food.  It is also a treat to see all the the themed decor and hear the Indian pop music.  This is precisely what I received as a first impression from Taj Palace.  I knew I had come to the right place for dinner.  A place that caters to all the senses is alright by me.  I was greeted promptly upon arrival and seated right away.  I walked through the door just a few minutes after they opened for dinner and they were not yet busy.  After I was seated, I was given a glass of water and my napkin was removed from the small plate infront of me.  This is where the service went out the window.  I was brought the two sauces for the papdum but they neglected to give me the papadum.  They must have forgotten to leave it at the table.  They had it in had when they left the sauce.  They also neglected to give me a menu at first.  Once they finally got up and rolling they brought all that I was missing and made it right.  I think they were not fully prepared for me as I was in the door early.  On this visit I decided to stray from my normal order.  I've had so much tikka masala and chicken mahkani.  I've had saag dishes plenty.  I wanted to try something different.  I finally decided to try something vegetarian, bengan bharta.  This is a tandori roasted eggplant with onion, ginger, tomato and peas.  I ordered a spice level 3 (out of 10) and it was about as much as I could comfortably handle.  It was very good though.  All the flavors blended well.  The only individual elements I could pick out were the peas on top and the few chunks of tomato.  Sopping it up with some garlic naan was they perfect way to eat this meal.  By the way, this garlic naan was some of the best I've had.  While the service started out rocky, it finished strong.  And the food was delicious.  For that, a solid four star review is warranted.  As this is one of the closest places for me to get Indian food, I will probably be back some time.  Maybe for a lunch buffett so I can try even more food.",

The place was about half full on a Friday evening, and the staff was nice enough, they were just woefully inattentive (except for the stoic man who diligently kept our water glasses full). We were seated for several minutes before we were given any menus, which should have been our first warning sign. The food took a long time, but it tasted fine, except for the glaring issue of getting a few small bones in my butter chicken when I was halfway through eating it. Until that point I had been looking forward to coming back another time, and it did not get better from there. Our server never checked back in on us after our entrees were delivered, or I would have sent my dinner back. We had originally intended to try their peshawari naan for dessert (a favorite of ours at our old favorite Indian restaurant), but after finishing our entrees, we were sitting there about 20-30 minutes before any employees even acknowledged we were there, and it would have been longer had my husband not stood up to say hi to a friend who was sitting at the bar. Remembering how long it took to get our entrees and then afterwards just to get a check, and annoyed by the bones in my food, we decided to pass on dessert.  And we weren't the only ones getting the shaft. Our table was near the entrance, and there was a gentleman there waiting quite a long time for his takeout order, and he was getting angrier by the minute.  Based on the food alone (minus the bones), it's a 4 star place, easily. The inattentive service, long wait, and issues with my entree just shattered the experience, 2 stars being generous. We will not be returning.",

Peshwari nan is really nice.  I will order tonight come to think of it, otherwise it will be on my mind for days.  I have never been into the restaurant.   Thanks Taj!  Always fantastic.  This allows me to feel free to try new things on the menu because I know it will be excellent even if not my favorite.",

The dining room somehow is always busy enough to reflect its popularity but available enough to accommodate without reservations. The wine is excellent! Favorite dishes include: veggie samosas, shrimp tikka masala, and dahl soup. And they offer takeout, if you prefer to enjoy it at home. Vishel B was particularly attentive and ensured a happy experience. We love introducing this place to our friends. What a find!",

The interior makes you feel like you've walked into some fancy fine dining restaurant. I am always seated immediately and water is served immediately. Then they ask if you want garlic or regular naan. Freak yeah gimme that garlic naan. Dip that shii in everything.  My favorite items from the buffet is the tandoori chicken, chicken tikka masala (OF COURSE) and the samosa. There were other curries that were delicious too but I can't think of the name. The samosas are crisp and flaking with potato filling. Those usually go fast. Their chicken tikka masala is the best I've had in Vegas. Like I said, DIP THAT NAAN IN EVERYTHING and this is one of those things that you just can't eat unless you got naan. I don't think they could give me enough naan. Anyways, the dessert choices are minimal to fruit and this yummy rice pudding.   I give them 5/5 on service. Never had a problem with any of them and they were very kind. Food is 5/5 too. Everything in the buffet is delicious, you will not be disappointed.",

I wouldn't say I'm an expert, but I spend most of my dining-out experiences in Indian restaurants and this time, I wasn't too impressed.  ***DISCLAIMER: I have left behind the perfect Indian restaurant where I recently moved from and I know nothing will ever compare***  We ordered Paneer Pakoras, Chicken Tikka Masala (spice level 7), and Chicken Curry (spice level 5).  The Paneer Pakoras were fresh and fluffy, but lacked flavor or spice.  The sauce for the Tikka Masala was okay, but no amount of creamyness or richness would save the dry chunks of chicken.  The spice level was pretty good, but if you like spicy Indian food, you better order something higher than a 5 because a 5 is the equivalent of mild (in my opinion).  The Curry was tender, but just okay.  Nothing much to report on that.  My biggest problem with this place is the price.  The Naan and Rice are an additional $8.50, not to mention the fact that each entree item is about $15 a piece.  Yes, you get a lot of food, but that's standard at any Indian restaurant.  The Naan is nothing exceptional, either.  Our total bill came out to $45, which is crazy!    With as many places Las Vegas has to offer me, I won't be returning.  The staff IS nice, though!",

    "text": "It is a well decorated, charming Indian restaurant in the middle of a strip mall on Eastern. Parking can be a hassle on the weekends for dinner due to it being located next to overly popular and equally overrated BJs.  The service is always incredible. The servers are friendly, accommodating and extremely willing to make suggestions to get you out of the \"chicken tikka masala\" comfort zone.   For dinner, boyfriend had Spicy Vindalo ($15) which is chicken cooked with potatoes, spices, and vindaloo sauce which is the red variety of sauce. It was not very spicy as I believe they modified it due to fear of us not being able to handle the heat. I love my food spicy. The dish was good, nevertheless. I had the Spicy Haryali ($16) which was chicken cooked in spicy green sauce made with onion, spinach, mint, cilantro and green chili. Once again, it was very delicious but not spicy.   We ordered side of gralic naan ($3.50) and it was very good. Also, the server suggested we get Peas Pilau ($7) which was basmati rice seasoned with peas, nuts, and raisins. I didn't care for the raisins and probably would opt for just regular basmati rice next time.   We also shared an Indian variety of beer based on the server's suggestion. It was good and quite large. ($8)  All in all, the food was good and the portions generous...but, the total did leave a bit of a sticker shock. I think I'd opt for the lunch buffet and try to sample more of their dishes.  The service, as I mentioned before, was superb.  I would recommend this place if you are in the area and craving quality Indian food and great service.",

The butter chicken is flavorful and nothing on the menu tastes artificial. Ghandi's is still my favorite in town, then Orgin India and this place is third.

If that's True, then it's not Methi Chicken. Maybe they just figure it's easier to write \"spinach\" than to explain what \"methi\" is. In any case, it was good.  I've also discovered Kheer. It's an Indian rice pudding finished with nuts, raisins, and cardamom. For some reason, I've never had this dessert before, but it is absolutely delicious.

The garlic naan bread was extra tasty, crisp, light and seasoned perfectly! It usually takes a few minutes for the bread to arrive, but they were spot on today and it was ready when we chose our items from the buffet. I am a big fan of the Samosas and they have them EVERY time, where as some other Indian buffets it's there if you are lucky. Every dish is prepared perfectly, the service is excellent! The lunch buffet is the way to go, you get to choose from a variety of curries, chicken and vegetarian items. They have all the classic sauces and chutney to satisfy everyone from beginner to life long Indian food diners. The very left side of the buffet will have a few Indian desserts to complete your meal as well as some cool smooth yogurt to cool down a spicy dish. Nice simple decor and they usually have some Bollywood music videos playing on the TV for added atmosphere. Lunch buffet is around $12 and you'll enjoy it much better than getting some greasy lunch somewhere else for about the same price. We love it here and glad it's close by, no more driving all the way into town for Indian food and it's better here anyways! 5 Stars.",

Found out I'm not a fan of Indian food, unfortunately; my taste buds didn't have an A-HA moment.  BOO!!  I was really excited about trying something new and hoping to find a new favorite restaurant.    However, the Naan was very fresh and tasty, much better than Trader Joe's (duh Cody!).  So the Yelpers did me right on that review.  The buffet lunch was very reasonably priced at around $10.95 and had a nice portion of vegetarian options as well as carnivore options.  The service was decent and atmosphere was ok.    Seemed clean until I saw the employee transferring food from his pan into the serving pan with his bare hand.  Not a good moment for me, being a germ-a-phobe and immediately stopped eating.  I didn't share this with my boyfriend in an effort not to completely ruin lunch and the fact that he thinks I'm a little OCD.  Had it not been for this incident, I would have probably said it was an Okay lunch.    Probably won't be re-visiting Taj",

I called around to different Indian Restaurants inquiring about the lunch buffet and this place has the most competitive price at around $10 or $11.95 out the door. It may be a bit of a drive coming from the Eastside but its well worth it for me. Being a brown myself, I grew up on this type of food and after going to Mint India the day before which had food trays mostly empty, this place is way better. The waiters are nice, the food is always well stocked, tastes good, and the enviorment has a nice setup. I think until I'm able to go back home to Cali in a few years and enjoy my mom's cookin, it's safe to say that I consider  this place my home away from home and like a hemrrhoid, I intend pop up frequently and unexpected.",

    "text": "This place continues to be a wonderful eating establishment. Wonderful staff, super cheap lunch buffet with great choices.  We finally got the time to check out the dinner menu. It was wonderful. The menu had so much to choose from. And we tried new breads that we never even heard of. Lots of fun, nice atmosphere too.  Be warned the dinner entrees are huge, most likely intended to share. We overbought the first time expecting a cat dish of curry, we should have known better. All portions were well made and generous. They offer a few meal deals at night. The soup was wonderful.  We have been coming here since 2011 and never got sick. Which is a big deal for us. :) We have never had lousy service, the new manager is always smiling. Wonderful place. Recommended.",

Our little one was sleeping, she woke up 10 mins before 3 pm (close) and they accommodated us for 15 mins after close while she ate.",

    "text": "After a 3 day hectic trip we were back to Vegas and decided to pick our dinner from this restaurant. Some parathas, a gravy and a biryani. We reach home drop dead tired and sit for dinner. Here is what I find, all d breads had such a foul smell and were burnt. It was like the dough had gone bad but the chef still decided to go ahead and made the breads from that. We could have ignored the burn on the breads but the smell. So at 10 in the night even after spending more than 60 bucks for two, we had nothing to eat. (Gravy n biryani were not too great) I was really upset,  the breads went into the dustbin but I preserved one of them in the fridge to show them the next day. Nobody has the time to do that but I decided to as I was reallly upset. So when I took the bread to the restaurant and they were like do u need anymore food. I asked them to refund and the waiter Raj brings $3 for the one bread I had brought to them. I was really taken aback by his audacity to say that. Sorry that I didnt pick them from the dustbin and brought all of it.  I guess mistakes happen but how you handle them shows your character.",
