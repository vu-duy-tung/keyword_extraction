    "text": "Lets just say im big on customer service. And honest, I dont care how shitty the food is, if the customer service is good, I might try this place a second time. Im sitting here waiting for my food order because I payed with my card already. I planned on leaving cash tip as my order comes. But forget about it. This little girl in the front counter is rude, short with words, and cuts her eyes at you as your order. To top it all off, she is too busy yelling at her co worker and barking orders and throwing her hands in the air that she cant hear me calling her. Maybe shes ignoring me. Or maybe shes too engrossed in yelling at the poor guy behind the counter regarding his training and what he should have been training in. Honestly, I dont care anymore. This little heifer needs to learn some manners and some common sense. The only saving grace is that the food smells good. Im sure it tastes fine. Aloha, please get rid of your rude cashier/trainer/ankle biting guard dog and hire another student who I can give a tip to.  Edit: spam musubi was awesome. Kalbi plate cause some annoyance. The kalbi were thin slices of short ribs that were burned because it was so damn thin. Had no flavor. I didnt know that it came with katsu which was great, and chicken..... the chicken was gross. So gross even the neighbors pitbull wouldn't eat it. The best part of it was the side of kimchi it came with. So sad. If you have any suggestions to a better hawaiian bbq place. Please let me know!   A thought on that waitress, im sure after all these crap reviews about her she should have been gotten rid of.. BYE FELICIA!",

    "text": "Dousing everything in overly sweetened teriyaki sauce is not okay.   Nothing too spectacular here. Nothing that left the urge for me to go back and eat some more of their food. This place is close to UNLV and is convenient for a quick-fix meal.   The boyfriend loves this place. He gets the Local Plate (beef and chicken teriyaki, 2 spam masubis and macaroni salad with a side of rice) and it usually lasts him the whole day. Big portions. I guess this is alright when you're super duper hungry.   I do like their loco moco, though. I feel like I'm committing a health crime when I'm eating this. A large plate of rice with a hamburger patty and eggs smothered in brown gravy. It's a very hearty dish and gets kind of old when halfway through the plate.   I like the fact that you can call ahead your order if it's for to-go. When I call while leaving UNLV, my food is almost always ready by the time I get there. Again, convenient.",

    "text": "I only have one Yelp check in here, however I have been coming here for years. Ever since the first time I lived in the area 10 years ago.  There is something on the menu to satisfy whatever you may be craving.  If you don't want to stray too far from the beaten path then the Mix plate is a good option. Teriyaki chicken and beef, plus some Mahi. All of the plates come with rice and mac salad, which you should try if you have never had it at a Hawaiian spot. Here is a rundown of all the other goodies I have tried there.  Chicken Katsu - On par with the other Hawaiian places I have tried. Usually fairly crispy and not too fatty. The Katsu is offered in a number of different combo plates.  Kalua Pig - One of my favorite things on the menu. The meat is not very fatty at all, I am not a fan of really fatty meat. The pork is served on a bed of shredded cabbage which gives everything a nice crunch.  Chicken Curry - My favorite thing on the menu. This is a brown curry, a little more like Japanese curry than Thai. It comes in a soup container and is full of chicken and veggies. Pour it over the two scoops of rice and it makes the perfect cold weather meal.  Mahi Sandwich - Good for a light meal, I like that the fish is not fried. Served with fries and only a little over $5.  Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - A ton of fried rice inside a cocoon of egg. If you like omelettes and fried rice this will be a revelation.   Kalbi Ribs - Plenty of meat on the ribs and the sauce is what you would expect, with just the right amount of sweetness.  Lumpia Shanghai - Little eggrolls stuffed full of pork and deep fried. If you have ever had them before you know how addicting they are.  Loco Moco - Eggs and gravy served over a hamburger patty and rice. The quintessential hangover meal. It's warm, filling, and just the right amount of greasy.  Word to the wise, make sure you pick up a menu to see what is in all of the combo plates. The menu on the wall over the register doesn't explain what is in the combo plates. They offer a lot of combos and most of the above items are included in at least some of the combinations.",

    "text": "When to this place with very high expectations. After a successful Vegas trip for my friends birthday, what more to end the trip with a good place to eat before a long drive back to San Diego. The whole trip, there was a huge hype for Aloha kitchen being the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBomb.com&s=716853a54974befb18bd2a2079d876386c9ebd876290947c699fc1e3eaccf129\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Bomb.com</a> and all that... I was amazed how my first and last  experience was the worst service I EVER had at any place I have eaten at (literally).   My friends and I get there, and it did not seems busy at all. Just about a 1/3 of the restaurant was full. We were impressed with the menu items and we were excited to place our order. We sit down... wait... wait... wait.... and wait... then waited some more... 30 mins pass. With no acknowledgement of the staff that we have been waiting for so long and still no food. Then we see the another group of people who already ordered and sat down, get up and complained about the wait. Then they were told that their food has not even started cooking... I felt bad for them, as I am sure that they were waiting over an hour and nothing. Then the started to ask for a refund... then finally their food came out..  I was thinking, if their food is starting to come out... then our food should come out soon after a 45 mins of waiting. One of my friends went to go check on our food, and one of the ladies, stated that they just started cooking it. WTF really? 10-15 mins later.. our food started to come out and they were serving us the food that we did not even order. We tried to nice about it but the service was horrible. After straightening about ordered what.. Then find out that one of my friends and MY order has not even started cooking... WOW WTF!!!?!?!?!!??!! we waited... over an hour and nothing... WOW pathetic... I then complained to what is going on... why is everything taking so long and they made the excuse that there was no cooks or the cook who was suppose to be an hour earlier when we ordered, just came in..   Thank you for the courtesy of letting us know ahead of time so we could have at least thought about eating here... Thank you for not compensating anything for the time we have wasted waiting for our food and to find out that it was not even put in to be cooked. I simply asked if they can compensate us for a simple drink for the long wait.. and we got denied like it was our fault. ARE YOU FREAKEN KIDDING ME!?!? Asked for a refund, and it was a hassle for even getting my money back.  Finally... there was some acknowledge from the staff that there was something actually going on... that they were backed up yadda yadda... that would have been greatly appreciated hmmmm.... an hour ago when we first placed our order.  Honestly, I am not a negative person. I am really patient and I can understand that we are human and we all make mistakes, but I was not going to put up for any BS as that is all I got at ALOHA KITCHEN.   NEVER AGAIN GOING TO THIS PLACE AND WILL NEVER RECOMMEND ANYONE TO EAT HERE.    TIP FOR MANAGEMENT: CONSIDER NEW STAFF   This is not a review, this is a hate letter to this place for the time and you have taken away from my life.",

The rice is there to just suck up all the flavors.   I like to add a layer of Siracha hot sauce on top to give it a little kick.  This place is soo good!  The staff is really nice too!

LOL  Location: 4/5Because its so conveniently close to UNLV campus I found my self enjoying a beef bowl or a teriyaki burger a little too often. Thus how I got the \"freshmen 10\" but this place is super close to UNLV campus they also have student specials. The parking lot is easy to get into but getting out is a bit hard because Maryland parkway is always busy.  Food: 3/5 I keep it simple here, Teriyaki bowl and maybe I'll spring for a Spam Musubi or a side of kimchi. The Teriyaki bowl is decent, they're not heavy on the sauce here so that's a bit disappointing. The jasmin rice is perfect. I love their spam musubi its like the broke college students food other than ramen. Their kimchi isn't the best its not fresh nor is it tasty. It's soggy.   Price: 3/5 You get what you pay for. This place is cheap and the food is pretty decent, I like their other locations especially the one on Charleston a lot better.   Cleanliness: 0/5 This place is a mess, they have trays stacking with empty bowls and dishes of the past customers piling up. This was a super turn off when I walked through the door.",

After an early morning drive to Las Vegas, lunch, and a little entertainment, my wife and I had dinner at this comfortable and casual eatery. Aloha Kitchen offers a touch of the island vibe away from the hustle and bustle of the strip. Order at the counter, sit down, then wait for your meal to arrive at your table. Locals, students from nearby UNLV, and Yelp-savvy tourists populate the restaurant.   The adobo fried rice omelette is lip-smacking good. The adobo and fried rice are garlicky and flavorful, with the omelette cooked to delectable perfection. I tore through most of the enormous serving before hitting the wall about 3/4 of the way through it. I couldn't eat another bite, so I boxed it up for a late-night snack after a visit to the casinos. My wife ordered the pork kahlua and it was tender, smoky, and a huge serving. We also tried the spam musubi, which was your standard spam wrapped in rice and seaweed. Nothing remarkable, but enjoyable.  Aloha Kitchen offers affordable and delicious meals and it's a terrific way to get out of the casinos for an hour or two. The adobo fried rice omelette alone is worth a visit.   Highly recommended.",

Second, the guy at the counter who I'm assuming to be the owner or manager needs to fine tune his customer service skills on the real though. I tried, key word TRIED, to order the Student Special (which is chicken teriyaki bowl with rice and veggies) minus the chicken. He refused and said I couldn't do that. The end result was that I was made to order a side of rice and a side of veggies, which he then instructed the kitchen staff to add teriyaki sauce to and put in one bowl. It's the same thing dude!!   I was not a happy camper because he made the process of ordering a vegetarian friendly meal so exasperatingly difficult. I could forgive the poor customer service if the food was good, but it wasn't. The veggies had way too many onions and there wasn't enough teriyaki sauce to go around. It just tasted way too plain. End result: I ended up picking at my bowl and left hungry.",

Aloha Kitchen offers onolicious traditional Hawaiian dishes from loco moco to garlic chicken. Menu is simple and straight forward.  Garlic chicken is always a must order for me whenever I go to a Hawaiian restaurant. The biggest and most obvious difference between the garlic chicken here and other places is that chicken is grilled here.   At most places, chicken is marinated in garlic sauce then deep fried. When my order arrived to the table, I could smell the garlic but when I took a bite, the garlic flavor was barely there. It just tasted like a garlic chicken that was marinated in soy sauce. It was good regardless. Gravy was also good, albeit too salty for my liking.   I've also got to try their loco moco over easy egg. Beef patty was definitely overcooked and dry and rice was sticky. Gravy was the same one from garlic chicken. Not the best rendition I have had but still not bad in my opinion.  Service is fast and friendly. I will be back to try more items!",

Just a bowl of rice with some BBQ chicken and a drink. Its not a bad deal for a hungry cash strapped student. These days, there are other Aloha Kitchen locations that I visit more often but I still come by the Maryland Parkway location from time to time when life brings me to the area. And I more often than not order something other than a student special. I have found my nirvana in the locals plate. That is to say BBQ beef, BBQ chicken, Spam musubi, rice and Hawaiian style macaroni salad. It is basically all I love from Hawaiian food. How can you go wrong with what is essentially a greatest hits platter? I love it. Depending on who I am with when I swing by, usually a co-worker, I will get some lumpia too. We share an order as supplemental goodness. Its hard to share when you want to hoard but sharing is caring.   The staff here is friendly. They are efficient at bringing your food to your table with just a few minutes of wait time. They clean up aftet you so that all you have to worry about is eating. And eat you shall. The food is good and the portions are grand. Now if you will excuse me, I need to wipe the drool from my face and grab some grub.",

First of all, it was disappointing that they were out of pancakes. While we were looking forward to trying the macadamia nut pancakes, alas -- it was a goal unaccomplished.   The adobo fried rice omelette was a letdown for me. It was a huge portion that I would suggest sharing with a buddy. My friend and I each got one and we were both only able to finish half. The fried rice was lacking in flavor. I was tempted to put a lot of Sriracha in it. I had one little chunk of adobo and small shreds but the protein was fairly absent in the dish.   The Portuguese sausages were large slices and were pretty good. I also liked how the spam musubi had a good rice to musubi ratio. I detest rice being heavily packed into my musubi, so I was really glad that Aloha Kitchen did not do that. They also had a nice selection of the Aloha Sun drinks.   I think I'd enjoy this place more if I was really hungry or recovering from a night out from heavy drinking. The experience was not up to par with what we desired. With more options out there that I would enjoy more, I unfortunately won't be going back to Aloha Kitchen.",

We were greeted both days by Travis, I think that was his name? It was the name on our receipt. We came in today and he remembered our order. We just said we're probably going to order the same thing and he remembered our order from yesterday. It shows great customer service when people remember their customers. The service is excellent and the food is seriously so good. We ordered the adobo fried rice omelet, the macadamia nut pancakes, and 2 spam musubis, which was shared between me, my hubby, and our 20 month old toddler. Our son loves the food and couldn't stop eating. The macadamia nut pancakes were so fluffy and sweet and the adobo fried rice was so flavorful. We took the musubis to go for the drive home back to CA. Everything we got was under $20, which is less than what we usually pay for breakfast. This place is definitely worth the drive away from the strip for some good food, fast service, and super affordable prices.",

On a Sunday at lunch there was only one waitress for the entire restaurant and she was busing tables and doing all sorts of other stuff too. Felt bad for her the whole time.   There were only two other employees in the whole building I think so they couldn't really help when the kitchen was getting killed too.   This led to slow food times and lack of water, which is tough when it's 110 degrees outside haha. They have a water station to self-serve (suspicious) but it was always  empty anyway.   To put it into perspective, when my group got there, there was only one other table of people (had like 12 people though) and every other table had dirty dishes on it.   I love Hawaiian food too and the food here was respectable. But \"PAY THE MAN.\"",

Inside decor is nothing special but that's not why you come here. First time I ate here I had the Combo plate which was simply amazing. Rice was fresh and the katsu was cooked perfectly. Recently I've been getting the student special (only $5) for a healthy serving of rice and chicken plus a drink. Would recommend and def will be back again this week!",

I usually order the BBQ chicken and my boyfriend always orders the Kalbi ribs which is soo good. Their kimchi doesn't taste authentic it's a little more on the sour side, but their mac salad is delish. I've also tried the chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken and beef. They're all great tasting as well, but the BBQ chicken will always remain my favorite.",

There are huge plates that can be shared between two for $8-9 composed of katsus, curry, porks, and beef. Soups (although quite salty), noodle dishes, macaroni salad, and spam musubis are offered. It's located close to the UNLV student union in the same shopping mall as Smashburger. The restaurant won't look like much from the outside, but is large and clean inside. Order at the front and a server will bring you your food. Definitely a place to consider for lunch or dinner.",

I get the same thing everytime, I tell myself that I will try something....then again, nahhhhh.   Spam Masubi and Lumpia Shanghai, the reason for 3stars is b/c as much $#!t as I complain about the SPAM to RICE ratio of the masubi I still order 2 of them when I'm there.  The SPAM/RICE ratio is like 11/89 (11%spam/89%rice) where is THE SPAM.  I don't know how to make masubi so this is why I buy it, aloha is right up the street form the house therefore it's where I go.  No, this is not Hawaii, I know I know, but my Californian a$$ ate so much masubi in Hawaii it became my favorite fast food/quick meal.  To the point I was getting them from 7-11, but once again this is not Hawaii, this is LAS VEGAS is the SPAM/RICE ratio (to me personal) are very very unbalanced.  The lumpia is DA BOMB! and the teriyaki sauce OOOOOOoooooo, it is worth the $0.71, don't frown your face at the price.  You are not getting a little dipping cup of sauce, it's like a pudding cup of sauce.  I took the sauce, glazed some salmon that I had sitting in the fridge and tossed in the oven for 22mins, impromptu dinner, no seasoning needed.  Let's just say, I buy extra sauce I go, because I WILL DEFINITELY use it on something else.  The staff is super nice and the restaurant is always clean and in order.  However, I have heard good things about their kalbi beef, hmmm....I need to take a trip over to try it out...",

I was really excited about the adobo fried rice omelette. i read here that the customer service wasn't that great and it takes a long time to get your order but, for my group our ordering process was smooth and the cashiers were friendly and helpful. our order came very fast and the food was steaming hot so, maybe we lucked out or it could be the time of day we came (saturday around 12pm).   Along with the adobo fried rice we also got a bunch of lunch places including korean short ribs, katsu and chicken. All the meats we had was very tender and cooked perfectly but, you should ask for the sauce on the side as they did drench the katsu in sauce. the Adobo fried rice omelette was pretty huge and i wish they drizzled some adobo sauce on top of the egg or added cheese.. maybe you can special order it? the shanghai lumpia left us a little disappointed however.  All in all the food was extremely good and they give you very large portions for how much you pay for your meal. The staff seem friendly and they slap j boog, common kings and many island raggae which was dope. I would definitely come back.",

Everything we delicious!  Probably one of the best musubi I've had, but I'm not a Hawaiian native, so don't know if it was authentic.  The mac salad was good and not too creamy.  The ribs were tasty, but on the thin side.    Service was sufficient.  There's plenty of parking in the little strip mall area.  Cozy atmosphere. We'll be back!",

Aloha Kitchen has a student special for under $8, which includes a Chicken Teriyaki bowl and rice. There is a good amount of meat, and the portion size is more than sufficient for lunch.  Customers order at the counter and can receive their food there, or they can order and get the food brought to them. The place is a little dirty, and the staff mess up the orders sometimes, but they do try their best in getting the orders out fast, which is pretty important for students who need to get back to class in time.  Overall, this may be one of the most affordable and most convenient lunch locations that are in walking distance to UNLV, although the service can be a little confused.",

    "text": "I've been here before and had relatively good experiences, but today these guys really dropped the ball.  My wife is in school at UNLV, and she has exactly one hour for lunch. I picked her up and took her to Aloha Kitchen. We were in line by 12:10, waiting to place our order. Plenny time for a great island lunch, yeah?  No.  It took the counter guy 10 minutes to take care of the one person in front of me. Half of that time he was standing with his back to the register, waiting. Finally took our order at 12:20. Still plenny time, yeah?  We waited. And waited. And waited. I got up and asked whether they'd forgotten us. The counter guy assured me our food was \"next.\" Waited some more. A very polite busboy asked how long we'd been waiting. We told him almost half an hour. He checked, and told us our food was \"next.\"  At 12:45 I got up again. My order number was 58, and I saw that people with 60 and 66 had received their food. I told the counter guy we needed to take our food to go, because we were out of time. He got pretty snippy with me, telling me I was \"next.\"  \"You've been saying that for half an hour.\"  \"Whatever.\"  Finally got our food at about 12:55. To go. Dry katsu, no sauce. Mac salad instead of the kimchi we ordered. Everything separate, so there was no rice in with the curry or kalua--it was in with the bone-dry katsu. My wife tried to eat some of it on her way back to school, but burned her tongue on it because it was so hot.  The food was pretty good. I ate the katsu while fantasizing about having sauce. The mac salad was good, even though it wasn't what I ordered. If I had a two-hour lunch hour, I might consider coming here again. But only if they get new help. Seriously--the service we received today was atrocious.",

Service was friendly and although there was a line that had us standing inside right by the door, it moved quickly.  I ordered the adobo fried rice omelette (big surprise) and a half order of longanisa, put me out $12.37 but that's not bad at all! The omelette was HUUUGE and delicious. I was debating if I should order another for the road, but I knew I would be back in less than 2 weeks so decided against it. Of course the next day back at home I regretted it! Anyway, the longanisa - it isn't your traditional Filipino style longanisa, sad face. I knew it right when it was delivered to our table. I thought maybe it would be similar to a Portuguese sausage but it leaned more towards a hot dog, a sweet hot dog, if that makes any sense. It wasn't bad, but wasn't what I was expecting.  The venue itself is located in a plaza close to UNLV and across the street from, helllooooo, Starbucks, which has a freakin' drive through - WINNING!! YELP came through!! My peeps and I were able to roll through that Starbucks right before hitting up Aloha Kitchen and happily fulfilled our caffeine requirement for the day! Parking was easy and the venue was clean. Not a huge location but ample seating for good customer flow. Speaking of which, it looks like Aloha Kitchen agrees with local law enforcement as we saw several uniforms occupying a few tables.  Aloha Kitchen is probably a good cure to a hangover or if you're just straight hangry, or not. Come full and you will still probably stuff your face. Just make sure you do so before 10pm as this location closes earlier than the other location.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "After a long weekend of partying, we decided to come here before heading back home. I've heard great things about Aloha and seen yummy pictures, but, personally, I didn't find it to be that impressive.  I ordered the teriyaki combo, which was probably a bad idea because the teriyaki sauce was WAY too thick and sweet for me. The plate, itself, was decently sized, but their meat section of the plate wasn't all that impressive. It came with chicken, beef, and pork with rice and macaroni salad. Half my plate was rice, a small scoop of macaroni, 1 palm sized chicken, 1 palm sized beef, and pieces of pork. Due to the overpowering sweetness of the teriyaki, I got kinda sick from it. Their portion of rice to meats wasn't balanced. Their sauce, not good for me.  My friends and I ordered the same thing-teriyaki combo, while everyone else got the loco moco. Again, the loco moco had  too much rice compared to the meat and egg. Maybe their adobo fried rice omlette is better. That's what I've seen from friend's posts. Shoulda gotten that maybe.  Overall, I wasn't too impressed with Aloha. I'd much rather go to L&L. I left unsatisfied, but full. I guess it got the job done. I wasn't hungry the whole 14 hour drive back home....Next time, I might try the adobo rice. *shrugs but I don't know.",

    "text": "Everyone talks about this place being so good and a must to cure a Vegas hangover before leaving the City of Sin.  Very nice employees.  Our orders were taken and I kid you not, by the time I filled up my cup with something to drink and looking for a place to sit, the server was already looking for where we were sitting to give us our food.  That was fast.  They probably were starting on a few Adobo Fried RiceOmelettes while we were busying ordering and paying.  My gf and I got the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, Chicken Katsu and Miso soup.  The Adobo Omelette looks good.  The flavor of the Adobo is there, but it's just way too much.  For one thing, as much of a Filipino I am, I'm not a big Adobo fan.  I ate a little under half and just boxed up the rest.  Ended up chucking it.  For the Chicken Katsu, could use a little more flavor.  Although, they do give you a lot of chicken so that's always good.  It just didn't hit the spot that I was expecting to get when I saw it on the menu.  The sauce it comes with is very dense as well.  My gf also got their Miso soup.  We were expecting a small bowl just to get some warmth in your system after a weekend of partying.  I was wondering why it was pretty pricey on the menu.  It's because they give you this pho-sized bowl of miso soup.  They told us they ran out of tofu.  So in essence, this was literally just broth.  Would I come here again?  I wouldn't go out of my way.  I totally understand why people love this place.  I respect that, but this just isn't something I'd go after when in Vegas.",

    "text": "This place is a tough place to rate, just because we go here so often in every Las Vegas trip, we find ourselves here. I don't think this is the best hawaiian place ever, being that i've gone to Hawaii, but this is the best Hawaiian place in Las Vegas, at least it's my favorite. There are others, but not like Aloha Kitchen, in Vegas.  I do like to support your local Filipino's and they're here to help them.   *Adobo Fried Rice over Egg - This place is famous for this item. If you eat this by yourself, you're probably a food eating champ, a teenager, or haven't eaten in a while. Very duable, but very heavy. It is a lot of rice. I recommend eating with a friend.   PRO-TIP: If you get the adobo fried rice, it is likely all the other dishes will have rice as well. Try to get a la carte items you want or you'll have tons of rice left over. I've made this mistake many times.   **Portuguese Sausage, eggs, and rice - Least to say, I love this dish, but they need to put more sausage on this plate for my big body. The rice to sausage ratio is overwhelming on this plate. They need to reconsider the amount of rice for the loaf of sausage they give. I personally want more sausage, but I can't complain.   ***Spam Musubi - The classic side dish, works everytime. I always think they over do the rice in every place that makes musubi. It must be a thing, but I could just use half the amount they put in musubi's. That will probably not change.    There really is so much here to order and I love everything on the menu. I have a hard time looking and up and seeing if I want that today. It's tough being from california and having to pick only one for this one time of the year. I want to order everything! Thanks for the meal!",

After a brief wait the food arrived and it was more than we could imagine! With the Kahlua pig was served a side of rice and macaroni salad. I will start with the macaroni salad, so delicious. Slightly sweet with a great aftertaste, a must try. The kahlua pig poured over the rice was just a tad salty and utterly tasty. The lumpia was crispy and came with a fantastic sweet sauce for dipping, We will certainly be going back in the near future. Give it a try. Trust me.",

You order the food and seat yourself.   ::Drink:: I got the Hawaiian Sun Guava Nectar.  ::Food:: I've had better Spam Masubi but I did like the sauce.  The Corn Beef & Hash with three eggs (sunny side up) and three scoops of white rice were average.  We also got the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet which I didn't get to taste because I was full and wasn't satisfied with what I ate; I didn't want to eat anymore.  The Adobo Fried Rice is pork stewed in vinegar and soy sauce.  It has rice and it's wrapped in an egg Omelet.  Also, I barely saw any meat, mostly rice.  The portion was more than enough that two people can share it.   :: Customer Service:: -The Cashier got my order wrong.  I think he was distracted by a phone order.   -We didn't wait long for our food.   ::M's Notes:: -Parking lot -Inside seating",

    "text": "After attending a wine identification specialty class, and finishing off a ridiculously delicious bottle of Terra d'Oro moscato on the school lawn, with a guy and girl from my purchasing class, the three of us needed to kill some time before we were good to go home.  The Union was closed, none of us were in the mood for Mexican, and for obvious reasons we needed to walk to wherever it was we were going. The girl from my class said she was down for Hawaiian, so Hawaiian it was!   Walking in, the place is a combo Filipino/Hawaiian place, with some combos of those cuisines available. The place was empty when we went (5/24/11), but it was 6 PM - I don't think normal dinner time is the same around UNLV. Our food was delivered relatively quickly. I got the Kalbi combo - Kalbi ribs, chicken katsu and chicken teriyaki with two scoops of macaroni salad. The kalbi and katsu was decent, not the best I've ever had but still good. The teriyaki was, hmm, maybe had too much cornstarch in the sauce because it had a very thick consistency, more so than usual.   The service was friendly. The owner (?) cut in on our conversation to chat with us about what we had been talking about, so yeah, the service was friendly. Because we had been drinking prior to coming here, when the convo turned a lot less PG, I decided it was time for us to probably leave so we didn't disturb the people coming in to eat. Overall, the food was decent enough and was a good place to kill some time before we were good to go home. It's convenient to get to from UNLV and not stupidly overpriced, as so many restaurants around here are, so that's a big plus.",

    "text": "Before arriving to Aloha Kitchen, my expectations where that of a smile upon arrival and moderately speedy service knowing that it is mainly a takeout focused restaurant. When I walked through the door, I immediately smelled the teriyaki grill; It instantly made me more hungry. There was soft Hawaiian/Island music playing that really captured a smooth, friendly, no worries type of theme. There was not an overwhelming amount of Hawaiian decor, just enough to fit the ambiance and keep a modest, family owned touch to the place.   As I approached the register I was greeted with a \"What can I get started for you?\" I replied by ordering the Kalbi Ribs displayed on the menu board above and behind the register. The cashier took my credit card, gave me a receipt and a number holder for my table then said \"Sit anywhere you'd like, your meal should be out in about 10 minutes.\" As promised, about 10 minutes after sitting my meal was brought out to me. The food was absolutely to die for. The ribs where cooked with just the right amount of tenderness, and had an amazing amount of flavor. This meal was definitely worth the wait.  In all, the restaurant does a fantastic job providing a calm, relaxing feeling throughout the entire experience. The cashier could have done a better job greeting me with a \"hello\", or a \"how is your day going\" before getting straight to \"What can I get started for you?\" However, too much conversation could be a bit annoying so she did a great job keeping it quick and to the point. The food and experience was fantastic, and will definitely be back soon.",

    "text": "I went to Aloha Kitchen with my boyfriend on a Monday morning because we wanted it to be our last stop before we head back to LA. This is our normal routine when we close out an awesome Vegas trip.  When we arrived, there was one party waiting for their to go orders, and one person waiting for his food to dine in, so we figured that our food shouldn't take long. I ordered my loco moco with over easy egg, and my boyfriend ordered an adobo omelette.  We sat down at 10:10 and waited for our food. At 10:40 the loco moco finally came out (it's an egg on top of a hamburger meat on top of white rice all topped with gravy). At 10:50, my boyfriend wanted to check on his order, he said \"Can I follow up on my order, it's been 40 minutes?\", and the server says with a hint of sass, \"You're order is being made, I'm still waiting on other orders\". Finally after 10 more minutes of waiting, the server drops off (more like slams) his food on the table and says, \"sorry about that\" (sarcastically) and walks away without giving him any utensils to eat with.  He eats two bites because he lost his appetite, and I go grab a to go box. What i see is a bunch of people waiting for their to go orders, tables of people with no food on the table, a long line of people waiting to order, and all the servers turned their back on them talking to the cooks looking flustered.  Aloha Kitchen, I understand being backed up in the kitchen, may I suggest some sort of appetizer (chips and dip) while customers wait, or more sympathetic servers.  The food was okay, I think the service puts a damper on the actual eating experience   Not a great way to end a Vegas trip, but I do suggest Kung Fu Tea if you love great boba and great service.",

I will say that this might have something to do with the fact that I got an order to go, but it tasted a little like those Costco shrimp tempuras.  Teri chicken was delicious, not dry, and charbroiled well.    Overall, it was a great deal for the price, and excellent vicinity to my meeting at UNLV.  I would go there again out of convenience.",

It came out to be about 8.50 for the plate. Overall, the food was good, but I had better. Apparently, people were raving about this place: hawiiaan bbq with a hint of Filipino kick.

And you don't have to be from Hawaii to eat here! It is genuinely for everyone from all walks of life because food is the compound that binds us together. Beginning of college couple months ago, the word crave was engraved in my tongue; I craved local Hawai'i food, I had a friend show me Aloha Kitchen and I praise him for it! The food is beyond anything I've ever had back home in my honest opinion! The BBQ chicken plate is by far my favorite and I mop the plate every time I come here. The flavors caress your taste buds and you get a rush of home blasted into your mouth and it makes you come back for more. I recommend this place 5 out of 5 stars every time, any life. God bless and Mahalo to the folks at Aloha Kitchen that make this delicious food with such delicacy and the deliberate intent to make you smile whenever you see your plate come out the back.",

Living near campus and working on campus, this place has become a staple for me. One of the few places I will actually crave food from, run and get food to go from and I try to turn all my friends onto them. Their Kalbi Ribs are AMAZING and the teriyaki chicken is probably the best or my favorite I've had from any place. Their Kahlua pork is also great. They have a pretty extensive menu, and I always say I'm going to try more of their food but the Kalbi Combo is so good I always get it. Always consistent, great/friendly staff, very clean restaurant and extremely reasonable/great prices- if you haven't been here yet, you need to!",

This location is located in a strip mall with the university theater (doesn't look like they are currently in business) and a vape store. But don't let the run down area discourage you because the food here is wonderfully tasty and quite cheap.   Anyways, my husband and I stopped by here this past Saturday evening around 8:25 pm and made a to go order. This place was nearly empty with the exception of 2 small tables. While we waited for our order to be made, we saw a handful of people come in to pick u their to go orders. We only waited maybe 15 minutes. This is what we ordered:  Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combination Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- The katsu served is chicken. This combination meal comes with 2 large pieces of Mahi Mahi (white fish) and many tender pieces of chicken katsu. Also included is 2 scoops of white rice and a small side of macaroni salad, which was good and creamy. I didn't like Mahi Mahi that much because it was bland. It was coated in egg and fried. I think there should be added seasoning to this (but the tartar sauce, on the side, that comes with the fish helped). With the generous portions, this meal was made into two.   Mix Plate, $7.99 prior to tax- This combination plate comes with Mahi Mahi, teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken (2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad too). My husband was not a fan of the fish as well and agreed that it was rather bland. Both the chicken and beef were good but it would have been nice to have the chicken or the beef cooked differently (maybe swap out the teriyaki chicken for chicken katsu or something) to really give more variety to this meal. My husband (I had a few bites) ate this whole meal and felt pretty full afterwards. Just like the portions of my meal, this was pretty large as well (which could have made for 2 meals too).  --------------------------- (Total= $17.27, includes tax)  After we placed our order at the register, immediately the cook in the back got to work with our food (love that it was made to order and not just waiting around, ready to scoop into a styrofoam to go box). They also have sriracha available if you want some with your to go order (just have to ask for hot sauce, which is the famous brand, Huy Fong, in case you wanted to know.. not that it matters to me because I don't like spicy foods).   Wait time for our food wasn't too long and food was pretty good. It was pretty cheap and filling. We will definitely make sure to stop here again the next time we visit Las Vegas.   By the way, there is free (unprotected) WiFi and they do not take anything larger than a $20 bill (they also take credit card if you didn't bring cash).",

I ordered some spam masubis and they were really big and tasty. They were about $2 and some odd change, so 6 of them came out to almost $15. It was worth it though because it hit the spot for my Spam craving. Next time I will try their Kalbi ribs. Service was a little relaxed, so I recommend calling ahead of time to save time waiting at the store.",

I've tried the version at Babystacks and it just doesn't compare to this one.  This version is much more flavorful with also more meat than its competitor.     So what is it?   Chicken Adobo is a staple Filipino dish consisting of a meat (chicken or pork) cooked in a soup/broth of soy sauce, vinegar, garlic, and rosemary and eaten over rice.    The adobo omelette they serve here is just that wrapped up in a thin layer of egg and green scallion.   The food comes piping hot and if you came by yourself, prepare to have leftovers!  I've also tried the kalbi ribs w/ kimchee and spam musubi.  Average.   There are other places that do it better.",

So when presented with a choice of grabbing some quick food from either Earl's Sandwiches or trying something new like Aloha Kitchen, I decided for the latter. Reminiscent of the Aloha Kitchen back home in the San Gabriel Valley (Los Angeles for you non-626 people), the place gives off more of a neighborhood restaurant than anything else.  The restaurant is pretty inconspicuously located off the Las Vegas Strip in a Las Vegas Strip... mall.   I ordered the loco moco (ehhh they aite) and the others ordered the adobo omelette and a few other items. The adobo omelette was good but a bit salty for me. Probably the best part of the meal were the banana macadamia pancakes. Those were out of this world and I don't even like pancakes.  Not too bad of a place. I'd tag along if the friends wanted to come back. Otherwise I'd stick with walking to Planet Hollywood to get a Fat Tuesday with a side of Chipotle burrito or Earl's Sandwich.",

    "text": "I'm a pretty easy reviewer. I liked this place because it reminds me of the filipino joints in San Diego (Tita's, Conching's, etc). We were in Vegas for my birthday and the day we were leaving, we of course had the munchies. We came here before starting our long drive. I ordered the Loco Moco and it was crazy good! I tried a bite of the Adobo Fried Rice Omelete and that was just as good! The food hit the spot and I slept half the ride back home lol.   Now, if you come here, dont expect anything fancy smanchy. The decor is Hawaiian, it's a quickie in and out joint - grab your food and go. Food is served on foam plates and you use plastic forks and spoons. If you can't handle that, then pssh, you're missing out on some good food! Put the $100k silverware away and try this place out. Sometimes the best foods in town are served on foam plates and must be eaten with plastic utensils. =D",

We had a dirty table and asked the server to please clean up multiple times. He finally said he would wipe it down once he gets the food to us, which is terrible. They should clean up right away. Another thing I'd like to add is that they already told us that it would take awhile to get the food out..they said \"20 mins\" when in reality it took 30 to 40 mins. Sorry.. I appreciate good food places but I had a terrible first experience here. I wouldn't suggest the one near UNLV.. maybe the one downtown is better in service.",

    "text": "Went here on the request of a friend visiting the Las Vegas area. It was conveniently located close to the Strip/UNLV and since it was early on a Saturday (with most people hungover), there was plenty of parking and I'm pretty sure we were the first ones in. Our party ordered 3 different items: Loco Moco, Spam (I know I'm boring) and the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. Portions were good for the price and they offered your typical Hawaiian drinks. I feel like the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet is just the rice, wrapped around the egg and am not too sure why people go crazy for it... because if I'm eating Adobo Fried Rice, I'm probably going to want a side of eggs anyway (and I think over easy would be better so the yolk gets on your rice). Maybe it's just another Vegas thing I don't really get (I said Earl of Sandwich was just ok too). Comfort food and great company is always good, so if you're nearby, it's worth checking out if you want cheap eats.",

I've been here only one time prior to this trip, but that was back in 2007 and I wanted to make sure this place was still good! There menu offered plenty of standard Hawaiian food style things like loco mocos and spam musubis, but people come here for the adobo fried rice! When my plate finally arrived the smell was intoxicating and my mouth was instantly watering. The fried rice did not disappoint this hungry stomach! There was a lot of flavors, albeit a bit salty, but it wasn't too bad. If you've ever had adobo on its own with rice and loved it the adobo fried rice will make you happy.  Three stars only because I've honestly only tried one thing there. But I look forward to future trips when I make my way back to Vegas and try other things on the menu!",

What I ordered: Tapsilog (beef, rice, and 2 eggs) How it tasted: delicious! So good, it made me miss home.  Issues:  The portions were really not what I expected.  I ordered it to-go, so it came in a styrofoam container.  There was SO much rice that it filled the whole bottom of the container and they gave me about 7-8 TINY pieces of tapa.  I ordered my eggs over-easy and when I opened my container, the eggs were broken and yolk was everywhere.  Would I come here again?  Maybe not this particular location, but I would order from Aloha Kitchen again.  Expect an update on this review from another location.",

Does it help I'm a Filipino who loves Hawaii? Yeah...but it probably helps more that I'm a glutton for punishment.  I usually order their signature dish, the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.  It tastes like Mom's cooking... but instead of a runny egg, its omelette style...very clever.  Pair this with a Lilikoi Hawaiin Sunrise drink... and you're set.  Their other hawaiin dishes are ok, and their silogs (filipino breakfasts) are also pretty decent, overall its a great place to grub.  The only thing I felt wasn't really good was their Ox Tail Soup.  What I figured was KareKare, or some kind of Nilaga...was not... the broth was pretty tasteless.  Workers here a young, probably highschool or UNLV students... and mostly asian/filipino/hawaiin... so usually pretty cute ;) Cute girls tha work in a restaurant always makes my food taste better.",

I finally tried their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of spam masubi... with coconut juice... HEAVEN. I ate 75% of the omelette... it was honestly delicious! I also inhaled the spam masubi!

Yes, I'm mean... but when a girl is hungry... you don't mess with my food!  Our total for all our stuff... $20+ = our cheapest meal this past weekend!  Definitely try it out folks... it's so close to the strip... you won't get disappointed!  PS: they had tapsilog for $4.99... was so tempted to get it but that would be gluttony overload.

I used to work in an authentic Hawaiian restaurant run by Filipinos back home in Elk Grove and this totally reminded me of it from the food to the decorations.  Over my stay at my old work, I've learned to distinguish authentic quality hawaiian food vs lesser quality (L&L). I must say Aloha Kitchen is up there! The typical food choices you normally see at Hawaiian restaurants can be found here such as chicken katsu, teri beef, teri chicken, loco moco, pork lau lau, mac salad, spam musubi, etc. Aloha Kitchen also adds in some filipino dishes like Silogs and their famous Adobo Fried Rice omelette (my favorite).  The staff is really friendly and the interior is decorated with all things Hawaii. The food is always fresh and takes no more than 10 minutes to prepare. The dining area has numerous tables and can even accommodate large groups. I enjoyed the hawaiian license plates, surfboards, paintings, and other decor.",

I figure that all Islander restaurants have the same menu... but what place has an adobo omelet?? Exactly....  The omelet is filled with pork adobo chunks and all the rice is pretty much soaked in the sauce. No complaints. The egg is probably like 3 eggs that is cooked just right. They also add green onions to the egg, which I think is awesome! I like to put Siracha on top to give it some spicy hotness. Yummmmmm..... the omelet is huge so if you're not a heavy eater, then I suggest that you share it =)  I also get a spam musubi to go for the long car ride or the hour flight back to San Diego. I usually get my musubi's dry, I don't like the sauce they put in it. Service is great there and the omelet is on point... I'm sure the other items are good, you just have to read the other people's reviews to find out about them.  Not aloha hello... aloha goodbye!! Cheeeehooo!!",

I took my mom there for lunch today and we ordered a Kahlua Katsu Combo and a Kalbi Combo. My mom is the pickiest eater and I never expected her to be lighting up fireworks about this place, she hated Island Flavor and was alright with Island Style.   The Kahlua Katsu combo consisted of two sides of rice, the juiciest most flavorful kahlua pig and a huge cutlet of chicken katsu, the sauce was right on point. My Kalbi combo had a side of rice, OMG yummy macaroni salad! It had tiny pieces of celery and I absolutely hate celery but I couldn't even tasted it and I was in love. The plate also came with a super crispy teriyaki chicken, kalbi ribs that tasted like they came off the grill and a generous portion of chicken katsu with the yummy sauce.   I'm surprise the rating isn't much higher. This is some of the top Hawaiian yummies I've ever had! Let's start with the prices, WOW, it's cheap and you are in for a big surprise. We ate all that food and two refillable soft drinks for $20 bucks and some spare change. I definitely recommend it. The place was packed so it must not be just me that thinks it's well worth it and highly recommended.",

It's not the most upscale place to eat at. Far from it, actually. But regardless of the interior, their food is G.O.O.D!!!! You walk up to the counter to order then they bring your food to you at the tables. There's plenty of seating, but PS, this place gets really busy on Sundays during lunch.  I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette with a side of corned beef. OH-EM-GEE let me tell you, the corned beef was amazeballs!!! I think it was the best tasting corned beef that I have ever had in my life!!! The adobo fried rice omelette was a HUGE portion. UHMAYZINGGGGGG as well. I dont know why I havent been to this place before. I was seriously enjoying every single bite of my food  My friend got the locomoco and I tried it and thought it was really good as well, not too salty.  I'm for sure making Aloha Kitchen a must-go-to spot whenever I'm in Vegas. I'm hoping they open their California location in Cerritos!!! (PLEASEEEEE!!!)   Try it!

    "text": "Now, this place is a staple for students.  Located right by UNLV, when school is session the Aloha Kitchen is always packed when lunchtime rolls around.  However, students also don't have the most discerning of tastes.  The big draw here is the $3 chicken teriyaki 'bowl.'  It's basically just a few pieces of chicken teriyaki and some rice, and for $3 it's definitely a steal and when you're done you're not hungry anymore.  The thing is, it's not that good really.  The sauce is kind of bland and I've found the chicken to be fatty.  But, hey, what do you expect for $3?  They have a no-debit-card-under-$5 policy which is super annoying when you live off of plastic like I do.  I was forced to get some spring rolls that I didn't want once because I wasn't aware of this policy.  The good thing was that the spring rolls were better than the chicken bowl.",

I would have to say that my current favorite thing here is the Kalua Pork; every time it is tender and delicious. If it wasn't for the Kalua Pork, my review would be lower.  I have also tried the katsu, bbq chicken and teryaki chicken, all of which are good, but does not blow me away.  The food here is simple, which I can appreciate.  It usually consists of your chosen meat, rice and a side of macaroni salad.  I think the macaroni salad is a little bland and heavy on the mayo flavor, but not terrible.  All in all this place is reasonably priced and turns out decent food.",

I find it weird that there are two areas to dine in yet everyone's seated in view of the counter. I wonder if people just aren't allowed to sit in the bigger room?  Anyway, my favorite is the kalbi plate. The sour kimchee obviously came from a jar (I forgot what the brand is) but I still enjoy it very much. I had the local plate before and I only liked the spam musubi. I also like their adobo omelette...sometimes. It can either be tasty or too dry and bland. 50/50. It's probably a good idea to ask for extra adobo sauce to guarantee flavor.   I gave up on trying any other items on the menu because they never seem to have anything. No oxtail soup, no laulau, no bbq pork.. dang it! So I just go for the Kalbi plate or an adobo omelette if I feel like enjoying leftovers.",

First impressions, typical hawaiian plate lunch place with the typical foods; spam, teri meats, kalua pork, etc. but they also had filipino food which is an added bonus.   I got the adobo and katsu combo - the katsu was okay nothing special, but the adobo was decent, wished they gave more of the sauce. The only disappointment was the mac salad, it seems as if I was eating straight mayonnaise, no flavor.   Best part of the meal they have Fruit Punch. Cheehee!",

    "text": "All my friends who have been here make it a point to make a stop here at least once while they're in Vegas. We came here on our way back home from Vegas. I kept hearing all these great things about their adobo fried rice omelet which sounded so intriguing! I like adobo, and I like omelets so that sounded like a win-win already. It's a pretty decent sized restaurant with another room in the back with more seats. Our group of 12 was able to push together seats and tables so we can all sit together. We ordered separately and they give you a number placard to put on your table. So we all ordered one by one and sat waiting at our table.   Service: Pretty disappointing. The food started coming out at the same time, some dishes took longer than others but for the most part people who ordered the same item got theirs at the same time. Then it started to slow down and about 6 people had their food already but only 2 people were given forks. We had to constantly remind our server to bring out forks, etc. to us. After 10 more minutes almost all of us got our food except for one person... when everyone else who ordered the same exact dish already had theirs and was halfway through eating it by then. No joke, it took another 10-15 minutes for his dish to finally come out. I asked our server, Ana if they had forgotten about his dish to which she replied no. mm hmm, because it always takes about 30 minutes to make one more tapsilog right? We got the food with no explanation or even acknowledgment that it was late. After that whenever I needed something I went right up to the counter so I didn't have to wait. I would understand if the restaurant was packed, but at the time we were there it wasn't.   Food: This is at least the good part. The food was good here. We ordered the adobo omelet which was excellent on both aspects. I like to think of it as adobo fried rice with a better presentation of the egg portion. Like I said, you can't go wrong with adobo & an omelet. I also ordered the Loco Moco, which was also good. I thought it was very similar to L&L's Loco Moco, but then again since I waited for everyone to get their food it was cold by the time I ate it- still good anyway.   Since I base my ratings on my overall experience at a restaurant (service, food, & ambiance), I had to knock off stars for the service portion.  Hey, what can I say, service can make or break your experience am I right?  At least the food was good enough for me to come back again next time I'm in Vegas.  Maybe I'll try one of the other locations though instead and hope for a better time.",

The 4 of us ordered 3 adobo fried rice omelettes (my boyfriend and I shared one). We didn't realize how huge they were! We were trying to imagine how good the omelettes would taste if we were drunk late at night. We all didn't finish ours and ended up getting boxes to go.   My boyfriend and I also ordered the adobo katsu combo plate. The chicken katsu was great, very light (the way it should be). It seems like the adobo was slow-cooked. The meat was very tender and full of flavor. I can't wait to go back and try out some of their other menu items. I also can't help but also be curious about how the other Aloha Kitchen locations measure up.  Watch out: Don't even try to take a cab out here because you'll have to take a bus back to the strip.",

I got the Loco Moco which sounds amazing in theory but was a little bit much after I ordered it: it's essentially burger meat topped with gravy, an egg, and rice. My friends had the Adobo, which is one of the more popular dishes, which is an omelet filled with rice. That would have been my recommendation if you're a fan of either things. The Katsu was not too great either. Yes, I tried everyone's food.  The kids working there are young and nice, offering pretty good service with a smile. I came back a few days later for quick to-go order of macaroni salad and spam musubi and it took twenty minutes. The place does get a bit busy but they could definitely be a little more efficient in their orders.",

The curry was had just the right amount of seasoning and the chicken katsu was crispy and tender on the inside. They include 2 scoops of rice, some cabbage for health, and inside the curry also included tender pieces of chicken that have been in the pot for a while so it's so tender! It practically falls apart.   All of this was for about 10$. I will for sure be coming back to try the adobo fried rice omelette.   Their menu is quite extensive and they also had oxtail ramen!

I'm sure he could tell i never ate this place before, he never once asked or suggested any items. He didn't once smile. Didn't say hello didn't say thank you. I definitely will not be coming back to this place and I'm definitely going to tell my friend who recommended this place about my experience.",

Their pancakes are served with this yummy thick vanilla sauce. You can also have it with syrup but why when you can get that anywhere else?   Order at the counter and they bring the food to your table. Drinks you serve yourself. Nice staff.",

It was almost 8pm when we got settled in our hotel and our stomachs were growling mad.  As luck would have it, this place was a short drive so off we go.  They close at 10 pm, half of the place has been closed off, but that didn't deter us.  I ordered the combo plate of mahi-mahi, chicken and beef teriyaki. It comes with two scoops of rice and a scoop of mac salad. There was so much food on my plate my husband had to help me devour it. He ordered the oxtail ramen soup, with a little reservation because we have a favorite oxtail place. He was pleasantly surprised his soup beat our fave. The broth was perfectly seasoned, the oxtail falling-off-the-bone tender, with lots of carrots ginger and green onions.  The best part of eating great food is having the best people serve and entertain you. We had the pleasure of meeting \"Uncle\" who was busy with his tasks but was not too busy to tall with us.  Uncle is the walking Wikipedia of Las Vegas. A resident since 1973, he regaled us with stories only a living witness can. Like The Dunes used to be where Bellagio stands now!  They have other Aloha Kitchen locations, but I'm not sure if they have an \"Uncle\" like this one by UNLV.",

We also got the chicken teriyaki bowl which was very standard, and the banana pancakes with macadamia but topping, which was glorious!  I will say for all the flavor, I wish they put a bit more rice, and probably added a small side of salad or something to add some color but also alkaline/veggies to make it feel a bit healthier and more balanced.  I also wished the banana pancakes had like ice cream or some whipped cream, but it was still very delicious on its own.  Price-wise, it was decent. I forgot the exact prices but the pancakes were another $6, the combo was about $8 or $9, and the chicken bowl was about $6, so a little over $20 total. Not a bad deal.  Overall would definitely come back. I wish they added some more veggies to the combos but otherwise it's a great experience.",

    "text": "I visited Aloha Kitchen on my lunch break 2 days ago (05/09).  I called ahead of time, placed an order over the phone for to-go and was told it would take 15-20 minutes.  Pretty decent timing for a lunch hour.  I showed up in about 10 minutes and decided to wait in-store since it was fairly hot that day, and it came out 5 min later.  Again, timing was good.  The restaurant is clean, there are a bunch of friendly faces on the staff (they didn't look like they hated their job), and there is a water tray sitting in the corner for you to grab your own at if you don't want to indulge on sugary drinks.    Food: I ordered the mix plate, which online says it is a combination of chicken teriyaki, beef, and mahi-mahi.  When I opened up the box of food at work, it was chicken teriyaki, mahi-mahi, and PORK.  Not sure where the communication went wrong over the phone but I read exactly what was listed on YOUR menu.  If it has changed since what your website says then you should update it for your customers who don't have time to sit in restaurants for lunch so they order what they want.  I don't eat pork, so that got wasted but everything else was pretty good.  Also, I saw many reviews talking about how delicious the macaroni salad is so I was excited for that.  Not so excited when I ate it though.  It tasted like rotten mayonnaise.  I definitely couldn't finish that. I am unsure where the reviewers got the idea that it was delicious at but it literally tasted how a dirty garbage disposal smells.  It was awful.    Is this going to be my first choice in food next time?  No.  Would I return?  Yes maybe but would be passing on the mac salad and making sure I am ordering the right item since their online menu is inaccurate.  I don't enjoy paying $9.50 for a meal that is only going to be eaten 60% of the way.",

She mentioned some combo with Korean Kalbi  and then the Adobo fried rice omelette as local favorites. Not in the mood for Korean food , I got the omelette. Took it back to my hotel and dug in....I have no idea what Adobo means but if it were up to me I'd say it means Amazing. The restaurant was clean, service was prompt and courteous.

Every time I visit Vegas, I always enjoy coming here and ordering their Kalbi Combo (kalbi, katsu and teriyaki), as well as their spam musubi. I've never had a bad experience. The food is great, always fresh and the staff is amazing. For $10, the portion was HUGE and I ended up taking it to go to my hotel. Even eating it cold as a left over, the food was still delicious! I recommend this place to anyone looking for great Hawaiian food.  They recently renovated their store from my last visit last year, and it definitely gives off a new feel while keeping with the same food quality and service.",

I have no idea, it's like the color of breakfast sausage patties. I feel kind of grossed out eating this. I can see areas where there is actually hamburger in there to compare with the filler. I don't understand why anyone would have the audacity to make a \"hamburger\" patty this way. I am extremely disappointed, still hungry, and grossed out.

How can you be out of flour and water?  The biggest reason we have problems getting in is because they don't open until 10.  By 10, I'm thinking about lunch!  But today we finally timed things right and got to eat here.  And the verdict...meh.  My wife got the Adobe Fried Rice Omelet with Chicken, and I got the Banana Pancakes.  The omelet was pretty good; decent flavor, nice size, and chicken in every bite.  It could use a little more soy sauce in it, but other than that it was a hit.  The banana pancakes, on the other hand, were terrible.  They were seriously overcooked;  they were almost black on both sides and tasted burned.  And banana?  Not in these babies.  If there was banana in these, you couldn't taste it.  And the Mac nut sauce was flat; it needed sweetness of some kind, as well as vanilla for depth.  These pancakes need to come off the menu until they can do them right.  These are quite possibly the worst pancakes I've ever had.  All told, the omelet gives me hope that there are some things on the menu that are worth the stop here.  I'm just not sure if it's worth trying to find them.",

    "text": "No Vegas trip is complete without a visit to Aloha Kitchen.  And that's because of the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet!   There are several Aloha Kitchens in LV, all of them off-the-strip.  Unfortunately this particular location is not open late nite for those drunken meals (if you want late-night Aloha Kitchen goodness, go to the Aloha Kitchen & Bar on Decatur).   But we didn't mind our last visit since we came here for brunch.  This location is by UNLV and has 2 dining rooms.  At this location, you place your order at the counter and they give you a # to bring to your table in the dining room next door.   Of course I went with the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet, which is always heaven. Shredded chicken adobo mixed with classic fried rice, wrapped in a scrambled egg.  My bf went with a Loco Moco and an order of siamin and we shared our dishes.  Even though BF and I were sharing 3 meals, we still didn't finish everything.  The portions here are big which is great, cuz you can pack the rest as leftovers to satisfy later cravings.  There are other Filipino and Hawaiian favorites on the menu too such as spam musibi, lumpia shanghai, chicken katsu, teriyaki chicken, and mahi mahi.     Highly recommended as the food is always on point and the service is so nice.  They truly do treat you like Ohana!",

I'd say one of the many highlights of the weekend was this dish. Great remedy for that long night of clubbing and drinking.   I took the advice of fellow yelpers and asked for extra adobo sauce with my omelette but didn't really need it. I thought they made mine perfect. It wasn't dry or anything and tasted like real home cooked adobo. GREASY! Though, I can probably state that the 5 stars are based solely on the adobo fried rice omelette. My friends ordered the katsu and teriyaki chicken plates, and they didn't seem too impressed....they kept taking scoops at my omelette D= even though there was more than enough for one person..I'd say it can feed 2 people.  This is one thing that I cant phrase with \"what happens in vegas, stays in vegas\" because I hope this place opens a location in San Diego...I made that perfectly clear on their suggestions sheet up front hahaha",

Ours did not come with any adobo sauce, I was going to ask for some but he insisted to try it on our next trip, as to not 'ruin' the flavor experience he was having.  I got the Kalbi combo, which is only, like, the best combo ever (L&L listen up!  You MUST make a combo like this), duh!  It comes with kalbi (a tiny piece :/), chicken teriyummy! (yeah! because I generally don't like beef teriyaki) and chicken katsu (which was so nice and thinly cut and extra crunchy!  Wanted to try some saimin after my girlfriend ordered it, especially since it was cold, but we couldn't let our first time be tainted with soup instead of the infamous adobo omelet, so I'll save that for next time.  Will definitely be back here again.  Our leftovers didn't even make it back to LA - it was THAT good.  They also have a Christmas buffet that makes us wish we were going to be in town - it literally makes me want to duplicate that here!

The chicken and beef were pretty good, however. It's a shame you don't get much more than that, and it's definitely not worth the $8 it comes out to.  Chicken Adobo Omelette:  The portion for this item was actually a good size, enough for two, so I was happy in that regard.  The combination itself was decent. The fried rice and egg were good, but the adobo itself was on the dry side.  If only I had known about the adobo sauce, which I did not know was, again, available upon request only.

I liked this place.  It's cozy, the people are nice, and they even bring your food over to your table.  I ordered the Bulkogi Plate ($8.50) which is marinated ribeye w/ 2 scoops of rice, salad, and macaroni salad.  MMMMM, soo good.  We got spam masubi on the side (rice, spam, and teriyaki sauce wrapped in seaweed), and is definitely worth a try if you've never had it before.  Um o yea, free refills!",

    "text": "Not sure what all the hype is about. First off, I went there craving some oxtail soup and so were others in my party. It was the main reason we drove across town to eat there for breakfast. Got there, waited in a slow moving line, got to the front and asked for a few orders of Oxtail soup. \"We're out\" they say. Immediate drop in stars right there.   Now what? My mouth was craving the taste of oxtail soup the entire way over and now I had to change my mind on the fly. OK, lets try the adobo omelet then. It was eh.... I mean it's a great idea and all but there was hardly any adobo inside this adobo omlete. It was probably 80% rice, 15% egg and 5% adobo. On top of that they didn't add any salt to the damn thing and it was pretty bland. Another drop in stars.   I kept hearing about how the Hawaiian food in Vegas is much better than ours here in LA but I beg to differ. It's terrible.   Needless to say, next time I'm in Vegas I will just wait for the California Hotel for my oxtail fix and I'll make an adobo omlete at home.",

I usually call in an order and pick it up on my way home, which is very convenient and very quick: 10 min at the most. Everyone is very friendly and the restaurant is simple and clean.  I have heard the adobo friend rice omelet is awesome. I still have yet to try it. But I trust the hype. How can you go wrong with adobo and fried rice??   Oh, don't forget to look out for the specials and UNLV student discounts. They also sell delicious Hawaiian Sun drinks to quench your thirst. Yum!",

The cashier had a smile on her face and welcomed customers as they enter the door. The price is decent, and their food is delicious, considering how they cook it upon order. This place, can't be compared to L&L, though, but they had more distinctive items on their menu than the latter. I suggest to order the mix plate, which is very tasty if you love both meat and fish.  The only bad thing about here is that their water comes from the pitcher, not the soda dispensing machine, which hints they're getting it from the sink, and their glasses are all stacked up in one corner. You have to put yourself your own water, and once it runs out, the busboy took like 10 minutes to refill it. The place is frequented not only by students, but also by some ghetto looking thugs that act like they own the place. Some of the tables and chairs are dirty and full of food crumbs, and the busboy doesn't go out of the kitchen to clean them right away. The Aloha Kitchen on Sunset Road is smaller, but better in terms of service and no wannabe gangsters.",

Well, I stopped asking that question as soon as I took my first bite of my adobo omelet!    I come for one item - the aforementioned adobo omelet.  Pretty much chicken adobo(filipino dish-very popular) with garlic fried rice, all placed lovingly and heftingly into a nice large egg omelet.  It's like a filipino torta/burrito, he he he.  The omelet is large and in charge and can be a pretty hefty meal; but I finished the last one all by myself.  The few times before, I shared, but I always wanted more - so I will always order one for myself in the future.  They've gotten a little smaller, but maybe it was just that one day that we went, because usually the portions are huge.  Now my friends like the other items on the menu as well, so I would definitely go back and maybe try something else, along w/ my fav item.    There are several locations, but this is the one I like going to the most.  We've never really eaten there; always carried out, but the staff is very friendly when we make call our order in for pickup and the place is generally crowded enough.  Parking is pretty open since it's just off the strip, so eat there when you can, but most people I know pick some up for the ride home; when they drive.  Come often and come for the omelet!  :)",

My favorite thing to order there is the Kalbi Ribs. It comes with plenty of kalbi, two scoops of rice, your choice of mac salad or kimchi, and sauce for the ribs all for $7.99. I don't know what it is about it..but it's so dang addicting! If you are looking to save some money, their chicken teriyaki is pretty good too. You can get that in the student special which is only $4.49.   Feeling like eating just a snack? Get a spam musubi! They are quite addicting and quite delicious. You can get a decent sized musubi for $1.99.   What you waiting for? Go get some lunch at Aloha Kitchen right now!",

I first saw this establishment in the 1990s, shortly after enrolling in some post-Graduate courses at nearby UNLV, and decided to give them a try.  My favorite dish is Kalua Pig, and I must say that it tasted every bit as good here, as it did in the islands.  It turns out that this is a family-owned company, and the folks there are from Hawaii also, so they KNOW how Hawaiian dishes are supposed to taste.  If you've never enjoyed the flavor of the islands, you're in for a very special treat, and I heartily urge you to stop by sometime, to give their many menu items a True sampling.  It's my belief that you will enjoy dining there, as much as I do.",

I loved the pig and the katsu was yummy too. The plate was huge two scoops of white rice, a scoop of their delicious macaroni salad. Which btw is sooooooooooooo yummy. I normally hate macaroni and potato salads from every where! This one is so yummmm you wish that there were two scoops of this instead of the rice!  Everyone is super sweet and helpful.

Chicken Katsu's exterior was a little more cooked than golden brown, but that's fine with me. No complaints since the rest of the dish was still good along with their customer service.  Only difference I noticed was the setting/layout of this location, but things are bound to change after like 3 years, right?",

Maybe they were having a rough day, but the female employees made me feel very unwelcome and one seemed irritated as she was taking my order. I told her it would take a minute or two to figure out what I want, but she just nodded and proceeded to stare at me while I browsed the menu :-(  I ordered the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, and requested an egg-white omelette at no extra charge. I sat down at a table and waited about 30 minutes until I finally got my order. I don't understand why it took so long! The place was not busy at all. I was even more disappointed with my order...it wasn't even an omelette. It was literally just an egg white, on top of the rice. The fried rice was just okay and lacking in flavor; I had to add some sriracha and soy sauce to it.  I was only in the Vegas area for vacation, but next time I'm there, I'll pass on this location and try one of the other three. Maybe I'll have a better dining experience and actually get my money's worth!",

Always liked their Oxtail soup, very hearty and filling and really good for a night like this, when craving soup other than ramen or pho. The oxtail was very tender and tasty. Broth was perfect, and the veggies were a good mix.  Also had a craving for Teriyaki Chicken, which I liked here as it was served over white rice. You can probably get better teriyaki chicken and oxtail soup at other places, but the recipes here are very simple but good. Their prices are reasonable and the menu is typical Hawaiian.

Their quality in food has always stayed consistent and the service always on point. They opened some more locations around the valley, but if you are visiting you should go to one of the originals near UNLV and if you want a drink go to the Sahara location. My favorites has always been the adobo fried rice omelette. Ask for more adobo on the side if u are a meat lover. The Katsu always has been a favorite with the right amount of breading and chicken freshness. If you're feeling for some Hawaiian soul food, aloha kitchen will feed those cravings!",

The restaurant is self-seating. You first order at the cashier then find your own seat.   It does tend to get busy here in the morning sometimes, so plan accordingly or call in advanced!   SERVICE:The workers there are extremely friendly and patient with giving recommendations.   FOOD   --ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE--  I got the adobo fried rice omelette which comes in a huge portion. It may look a little small but I saved it for two meals and it was really filling! The adobo flavor is so good and the omelette is just a perfect cure after nights out in Vegas!   --LOCO MOCO--  It was my first time trying a loco mock, but there was a huge enough portion for me and my boyfriend to share. The sauce is sooo mouthwatering, and really filling as well!   They also have a variety of different Hawaiian canned drinks such as the Lilikoi, Lychee Green Tea, Passion-Orange, and POG which goes really well with everything!",

From paying to receiving our food it probably took about 30-40 mins and when i had asked the guy looked agitated but i had asked politely and kindly.That was not ok.

The cashier informed me they were out of certain dishes/menu items, so be sure to get there early if you want something specific. The prices are also affordable and appropriate considering the portion sizes.   Tapsilog: your normal Filipino fried beef with 2 egg & 2 scoops of rice. The beef was cooked as expected but with a garlicy twist which I loved! However, they don't give you that much beef. Instead they load you with rice and eggs. I was fine just eating 1 scoop of rice and an egg. On the side they give you vinegar and ketchup.   Adobo Fried Rice Omelette: exactly what it sounds like. It's a huge portion of rice mixed with adobo inside of a thin layer of egg. This dish could definitely be shared between two people.   Banana Pancakes: SO BOMB. I think this was my entire group's favorite menu item. We ordered the short stack (2 pancakes about $5, 3 pancakes for $6.70ish) and shared it. The pancakes are a pretty big portion, it fills the entire plate. For size comparison they are bigger than Denny's or IHOP pancakes. It comes with a very very generous amount of the vanilla sauce. The pancakes and sauce combined just melt in your mouth (almost).   Would definitely recommend and eat here again the next time I visit Vegas.",

The photos of menu on Yelp are no longer valid as the not so friendly cashier emphasized that the price has gone up.  We ordered the lumpia Shanghai and the teriyaki plate. The lumpia Shanghai taste did not disappoint, but the size of the dish is so small. Not what we expected.  The teriyaki plate is not appealing. We were expecting that the meat have been marinated with teriyaki sauce, then grilled. Not at all. The plate looks like the teriyaki sauce is poured over like gravy. This plate comes with two mini scoops of rice and one mini scoops of macaroni salad. Stingy portions indeed.  I am not sure how college students are able to afford their prices.",

The places is not as shabby as it was years ago, and there is plenty of space to enjoy your meals. The staff is very nice and is always happy to serve you. If only the food come out a bit sooner, but that must be due to the great quality of it all!  As one of my favorite Hawaiian restaurants in the city, the food is exceptional in comparison to other places like L&L. The chicken katsu, one of my favs, is a thick cut of chicken, brown and crunchy in every bite. My number one here though would have to be the Mahi-Mahi. It's very different compared to a typical fish fillet as it is more akin to a fish omelette haha. Don't let that idea deter you, it is actually exactly like a Korean dish called meat jun, just fish instead of meat. And I just absolutely adore eating it!  All in all, Aloha Kitchen is a great place to eat on both a budget and/or hungry as it boasts great and large-portioned Hawaiian food.",

Here are a few things to try that make them oh so delish to come back.  Adobo fried rice omelet. Mmm.. just like home. Homemade adobo (pork) cooked in garlic fried rice wrapped in an omelet! How can you not resist that! The adobo is perfect, tangy, soft and peppery. You can share this omelet however it is best to buy one for yourself and eat the rest for leftovers.  I like to dip my rice in hot sauce it gives a better kick!  Things I have also tried: Spam plate- nothing to fancy straight forward, you can ask them to cook is crispy or soft. Corn beef hash- mmm.. I love corn beef hash. They make it crispy on the outside and soft in the side. Eat it with rice, over easy eggs and ketchup! Adobo Katsu- Adobo with chicken katsu, rice and macaroni salad!   The prices are decent and the food is great. However if you come in large groups they tend to forget a order :/ . It has happened to our party twice. A good place to check out off the strip!",

    "text": "There's Hawaiian food, and then there's Hawaiian food.  My introduction to such fare was in Hawaii, many years ago.  First was the inevitable luau which, although touristy, nonetheless introduced me to such foods as kalua pig, lomi lomi salmon, and taro.  Next came the \"traditional\" restaurant.  \"Traditional\" is in quotes because I'm not quite sure what tradition was being followed, but it was an attempt to offer some of the foods eaten by Hawaiians in the not too distant past, and even into the present.  I got my first taste of poi, which by the way is actually pretty good as a foil to the salty foods often served.  I then moved to a locals restaurant that served many of the same dishes, and fell in love with haupia, which when properly prepared is coconut heaven and when poorly prepared is coconut jello.  Lastly, I was introduced to the then new Pacific Rim (aka Asian fusion) cuisine.  Aloha Kitchen isn't like any of those places.   The menu is representative of what is sometimes called local Hawaiian food, and caters to the large local Hawaiian community that has taken root in Las Vegas.  The food is an amalgam of Pacific Rim cuisines.  It is cheap and filling.  A typical meal is the mix plate, consisting of two scoops of white rice, a scoop of macaroni salad, and one or more items such as kalua pork, chicken katsu, and pork lau lau.  Spam is also a mainstay (spam sushi!), or try the loco moco (bed of rice, hamburger patty, eggs sunny side up, and a big ladle of brown gravy).  Health food lovers need not apply.  Like most such restaurants, Aloha Kitchen is very plain, and very inexpensive.  The Maryland Parkway location is near UNLV, and feels like a typical university hole-in-the-wall place.  Order at the counter, take a seat, and your meal will be brought to you.  Meal #1:  I had never had a loco moco before, and decided to give it a try.  Loco Moco is a bowl of steamed rice, with a fried hamburger patty on top, followed by a generous portion of brown gravy, and a couple of sunny side up eggs.  The rice was bland, the gravy was bland, the hamburger was bland.  Once is enough!  Meal #2:  I decided to try a typical meal - one of the many mix plate combinations.  In this case it consisted of kalua pork, chicken katsu, and of course rice and macaroni salad.  The kalua pork was salty but flavorful, good in combination with the bland rice.  The real winner was chicken katsu, a kind of Japanese fried chicken with a sweet barbecue sauce on top.  Meal #3:  I got the local plate: chicken, beef, Spam musubi, macaroni salad, and rice, all for the bargain price of $6.99.  The beef consisted of thin small slices of beef with a sweet barbecue sauce, on top of sprouts of some sort.  On top of the beef was a thin piece of chicken, skin on, sauted until the skin was crisp.  Both were very good.  Next, Spam musubi; I had to try it.  There were two pieces.  Each pieced consisted of a thin slice of Spam (about 3\" x 1.5\" x 1/8\"), fried until crisp, on top of a thick layer of warm rice with barbecue sauce, wrapped in a large sheet of seaweed.  It wasn't as weird as I expected, although the seaweed was too chewy.  I'd give it a mild thumbs up.  This kind of food isn't fancy; it's heavy on the fat, heavy on the carbs.  I love it!  Aloha Kitchen serves a decent representation of the stuff.  I have a feeling there must be better versions out there, but this one is pretty good.",

    "text": "Let me first start by saying that I have never been a big fan of Aloha Kitchen. Being born and raised in Hawai'i, I am familiar with Hawai'i cuisine and Aloha Kitchen has always been just OK, nothing spectacular.  Living in Las Vegas, Aloha Kitchen has always been the \"last resort\" when wanting to eat Hawai'i cuisine. After my experience yesterday, I felt compelled to write this review. My boyfriend chose to eat here yesterday after visiting the UNLV campus. When we arrived, there was no one in line ordering, so we did not have to wait to place our order. We ordered saimin, adobo fried rice, a cheeseburger and a side of corned beef hash, There was one family of four who just received their food as we sat down. Every occupied table at that point had their food. The restaurant started to get busy as we waited for our food. After 15 minutes, we received our side of hash. Five minutes after that we got the saimin and cheeseburger. The adobo fried rice omelet took 30 minutes!!! RIDICULOUS!! How hard is it to make fried rice with already prepared pork adobo?!! Then about half way through my saimin, I found a hair in the soup!!! SO GROSS! At that time, the waitress was delivering food to a table next to us as I was telling my boyfriend about the hair. I know she heard what I said but made eye contact with me and walked away. I then took the bowl to the guy working the cash register. He apologized and then offered to make me a new bowl of saimin. At that point, I was so disgusted, that I declined offer. He did not offer any other compensation! He just took the bowl and turned away from me and walked to the kitchen. If I could, I would not give any stars but being that I have to select at least one, one it is. The food is a disappointment, the customer service is a disappointment...what more can I say!!!",

On top of that they alway cheat on the plates. We weren't welcome when we walked in and obviously they didn't acknowledge us leaving.

The fish was cooked, but the coating tasted raw in a few places.

Was it worth the $30 taxi ride to go back and forth from here? not really...  I like that the place is clean and roomy. Finding a seat was easy and of course, they had Tabasco available too. Great place just to have options to be able to eat Hawaiian food but average overall. It doesn't stand out or make me crave this place much.

We always get the aloha plate which is only 9.29! It comes with teriyaki chicken and beef, chicken katsu, generous helping of rice and mac salad! This is a must visit place when you're anywhere near the area or at school!",

Call in if you wish :P Haven't tried anything else on the menu, will definitely have to check out some of their other items next time! But the adobo fried rice omelet might overrule my decision. It's good, try it (:  The upgraded the seating area and decor since I was here last. Looks good and the booths are comfy!",

Great spot with great food and plenty of seating. Everything on their menu sounded so good, it took me so long to decide what I wanted.. Well, as a first timer, I tried their infamous adodo omelette. It was a little under $10, which was worth the portion they serve! Food is cooked to order, so it's nice and fresh.  The adobo omelette was as long as my forearm and they sure did pack it! First bite in, it was mMmmm, delicious. It just needed a hint of hot sauce. This is where Sriracha comes in! Not much meat in the fried rice, but the flavor was there, adobo-y. Haha. I barely finished 1/4 of the omelette. It was too much for me to eat all in one sitting!  I would love to try others on their menu!  Service was friendly and quick.  Price is reasonable for the portion they serve.. Plenty of parking.  See you later, Aloha Kitchen.",

They serve delicious Hawaiian Filipino comfort food that I can taste is made with love.   Every time I visit I order the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet. The egg is always cooked and seasoned to perfection and the fried rice wrapped inside is salty and savory. With shredded chicken that is tender and just melts in your mouth. The restaurant is very clean and the staff are super friendly! I can't say enough great things about this place it's like my second home even though I don't live in Vegas.   Ditch the expensive Vegas buffets and enjoy where the locals go!",

I also like the interior of this one, but I noticed that they do not have the bar/lounge area w/ karaoke like the other location.   The service was great! The man taking the order was very nice and repeated our order to make sure he had it all right. They checked on us on our table to see how everything was.   All in all! 5 out of 5.",

We took our food to go and didn't have to wait too long.  A friend recommended we come here. He even recommended a menu item, with minor additions. My hubby got it (since I'm a vegetarian)... the adobo fried rice omelette \"loco moco style\" aka with a burger patty & brown gravy.   They did me a solid and made me a tofu fried rice omelette and yes m, I opted for gravy on mine as well.   Oh my gosh... let's just say with the smells of the food in the car, we ate at the hotel pool cuz we weren't gonna make it to the room.  Hubby enjoyed his loco moco style omelette. The burger patty looked super juicy and thick, hubby reported the rice was seasoned perfect with bits of chicken adobo throughout the rice.  I am craving another tofu fried rice omelette as we speak! Amazingly seasoned fried rice speckled with soft pieces of tofu. The egg surrounding the rice was a nice, thin layer dotted with scallion. And wow, the gravy! Such a wonderful, velvety touch! It was salty - in a good way! -  and added such a great flavorful punch to the rice.   In addition, I tried a few bites of their mac salad. It's creamy and the pasta isn't overcooked. I also had a couple fries from my toddler's kid's meal and they were delish. Nice, think fries seasoned well (think Denny's seasoned fries or Rally's fries... but like, better).   Now that I got you drooling, go to Vegas and eat up at Aloha Kitchen!",

This location is located in a strip mall. But don't let the run down area discourage you because the food here is wonderfully tasty and quite cheap.   This place was nearly empty with the exception of 2 small tables. While we waited for our order to be made, we saw a handful of people come in to pick up their to go orders. We only waited maybe 15 minutes. This is what we ordered:  Mahi Mahi & Katsu Combination Plate - The katsu served is chicken. This combination meal comes with 2 large pieces of Mahi Mahi (white fish) and many tender pieces of chicken katsu. Also included is 2 scoops of white rice and a small side of macaroni salad, which was good and creamy.   Mix Plate - This combination plate comes with Mahi Mahi, teriyaki beef & teriyaki chicken (2 scoops of rice and macaroni salad too).   After we placed our order at the register, immediately the cook in the back got to work with our food (love that it was made to order and not just waiting around, ready to scoop into a styrofoam to go box).   Wait time for our food wasn't too long and food was pretty good. It was pretty cheap and filling. Get it!",

I think they use the same or a very similar gravy like sauce on both.   They really need to work on their tarter sauce.  It's not supposed to just taste like mayonnaise and look like it's got pickles in it.  The Kutsu chicken was good and they have the right plum sauce to go with it.  If I came back, I would come back for that but only that.  In True Hawaiian fashion though, they do give you an unbelievable portion for the price.  Sorry no pics.",

The portion sizes are insane!!   Each combo plate is overflowed with freshly roasted, bbq'd, or fried meat with generous scoops of rice, macaroni, or other carby staples.   The spam musubi is a must try. Just get one so you can save your appetite for the bbq meat.   The kimchi side is also generous in the amount provided. I highly recommend it as a pallet cleanser.   My fan favorites include: kalbi short ribs, chicken katsu, and teriyaki chicken.  If you really really want to \"eat clean\" just ask for sauce on the side and stick to salad instead of rice or macaroni. I haven't done this before because a little rice and macaroni isn't going to hurt you. Portion control is key ;) because they give you so much food.   The people who work here are so genuinely kind and caring.   I honestly have nothing but good things to say about Aloha Kitchen. It's always been worth the visit whenever I'm in visiting Vegas.",

The restaurant was nice and clean with plenty of seating. The young man that took our order was very pleasant. They had take-out boxes on there customer side so you didn't have to bother anyone if you had leftovers.   So she ordered the Spam Musubi, Macaroni Salad, and Lumpia Shanghai (6 mini eggrolls). The portions were a good size and she really enjoyed it. She enjoyed the Spam Musubi so much she ordered one for the road. She would definitely go back.   This spot wasn't good for me and my restrictions. I ordered the Sesame Soy Chicken Salad. While the chicken was cooked perfectly, the rest of the salad left something to be desired. The plate was too small to mix the salad together, the tomatoes seemed to be on their way out, and the carrots were so hard you couldn't get your fork in.   They still get their solid rating because I figure most people aren't going there for the salad.",

    "text": "One of the better Hawaiian places I've been to! (My friend recently told me that the Hawaiian food in Vegas is actually pretty good because Hawaiians consider Vegas the 9th island...Hawaiians, please weigh in and tell me if this is True....)  No wait, everything you would expect from a Hawaiian bbq place. I got the BBQ chicken plate (comes with 2 scoops rice, one scoop mac), and the bbq chicken was really good! I like it more than typical places like L&L, the flavoring was really great.  They give you a number which you put on your table and your order comes out, it came out pretty quick, pretty solid service!  Decently clean place, really kind workers, they have the Hawaiian sun juice flavors I always love.  Only cons: - Instead of sierra mist they have this knock off version called MIST TWIST that is not very good at all, my friend got it and it tasted really nasty lol, so just get a diff soda. - The bathroom sink was clogged but they said that it had just happened the day before because someone messed with it, rough.   Overall, not a bad place to grab some lunch the day after you rage in Vegas and need some food before you drive home. 10/10 would come again.  TLDR: reasonably priced, good portions, exactly what you would expect.",

    "text": "Was very excited to try another Hawaiian place in the area other then L and L. I had heard Aloha is better then L and L so I was eager to check it out. When I stepped into the restaurant there was one person ahead of me standing in line. As she left I stepped up to the counter and saw a display model of what a plate of food from here looks like. I got excited even thou I noticed the scoop of Mac salad was on a skimpy side. Oh well, I stepped up , ordered my usual fave at a hawaiian place ,chicken katsu plate. Since I noticed the skimpy display of Mac salad I decided to order a extra scoop of Mac salad, because for me the Mac salad is CRUCIAL to enjoying this dish ( I can get fried chicken and rice pretty much anywhere). $2 extra for a extra scoop! Oh well I love the stuff. As I am sitting waiting for my to go food to get ready, I observe the predicament one of the cashiers is in. They forgot to give the lady that was in front of me the right order. They hurry and call her to ask her to come back so they can give her the right items. About 10 min later she comes back and hands over the \"incorrect food.\" The cashier (with no gloves or anything) opens up all her food boxes and looks at them, then opens up the one they said she is suppose to have. We have 4 workers looking at the open boxes arguing with each other ( all while my food already ready sitting behind the counter getting cold). They finally agree and close the boxes and hand the lady back the SAME items they told her to bring back and said \" oh, never mind we didn't mess up.\", And just hand her back her bag. No apology for having to turn around and drive back to a restaurant for a mistake of a mistake. I'm sitting down watching this just thinking \" man, that gotta suck.\" As she leaves the cashier calls out my order and hands me my food. I ask for a side of gravy which which she charges me 25 cents for. I pay and get in my car eager to enjoy my food. I get home and open everything up...... And there's only one small scoop of Mac salad :(.  Now this would not be a big deal, but  the Mac salad is the highlight of a Hawaiian dish for me. Plus since it seems like they have a habit of messing up orders, I will not be returning. The food was good but not so amazing that the service shortcomings can be ignored.  I will not rerun to Aloha, instead I will continue to got to L and L, where my order is always spot on, my Mac salad is plentiful and my gravy is free.",

Asked if they can substitute the adobo for chicken katsu. He asked the cook and the cook says no that the rice already has the adobo mixture. I'm like ok can you do just chicken katsu and egg omelette? (Since no attempt on fresh rice will be made) the cook's expression was like it was a burden. Really? What's hard of cooking made to order eggs and put cooked chicken in it. Well when I finally get to my destination and hubby went to open his food why was their rice with pork in it? I am very disappointed!",

    "text": "So I don't know if this is the same place that I had gone to when I was in high school, but if it is it's gotten a WHOLE lot better. I remember going to an Aloha Kitchen on Maryland Pkwy right where this one is, and then I remember eating crappy Hawaiian food that I thought we could easily make better and cheaper at home, and then getting violently sick from food poisoning. But after overcoming my previous fears, and starting off slow with 1 spam musubi to go and then building up to their combo plates with no violent aftermath, I've come to the conclusion that it is now safe to eat at this place.   The food here is decent, not bad pricing for some things, and they get it right for the most part. Their mac salad is a little lacking in the taste department, but after being addicted to Fukuburger's mac salad nothing comes even close anymore. The kalbi ribs are quite tasty, and at a decent price at $7.99 for a plate. The spam musubi is okay, cheap and quite big for $1.99, but they put a weird sauce on it that is kind of like a watery teriyaki sauce that I could definitely do without, and I think they need to roast their seaweed wrapper a tiny bit more.   Overall, it's decent food for the price, but I am looking forward to trying their breakfast specials and see if they measure up to the breakfasts we make at home. Also, I did not get food poisoning here so that is definitely a plus.",

I think the omelette was AT LEAST 6 eggs, weighing in at about a pound and a half.   Also tried their mac salad, tapsilog, and chicken katsu and all were delicious.

    "text": "Okay so up til today, I'd have to say I liked this place...sometimes over Ross J's Aloha Grill...There. .. I said it.  The reason? Well I really do love the Korean Chicken Teriyaki bowl at Ross J's...its only $3.50 plus they give you extra sauce if you ask...free of charge...   I alternate between this and the Aloha Kitchen's Chicken Teriyaki bowl for several of the following reasons:  1)The sauce at Ross J's is a bit on the salty side...AK has sweeter sauce. 2) I get really good service at AK and when i study at UNLV=convenience  3) The portions have been more than adequate..(The chicken rice bowl as well as the Local plate)  Why they now down to 2 star rather than 4.5 star in my book ? ..      Local plate no longer comes with RICE! WTH? They were really nice and just offered the rice after I made it a point to pay for a side portion of the rice so that was cool of them.  But i was quite taken back by their explanation of why this place no longer adds the rice in this $7.59 combination plate ( The menu says that all combos are served with rice and mac salad) \"We don't add the rice anymore because we put rice in the musubi!\" Okay..first of all...if you are going to offer spam musubi..it comes with rice on its own...it isn't good business to try to skim customers out of clearly what was printed on all the menus.  You don't advertise a plate with spam masubi and give customers the spam and tell them to pay extra for the rice do you? Vice versa...you shouldn't sell something with spam musubi and say that the rice is now counted as part of a dish and the portion of the rice that has always been included with it is no longer included! The employee was nice and told me that she has told management to change it on the menu...Problem is the rationale for excluding the rice now is irrational.   I have always been happy with paying the extra 50 cents for extra sauce (although Ross J's never charged) because i liked it so much and i wanted to support the business.  But after today, i feel disappointed with this place...  Lastly, I ordered Mixed vegetables for a friend...opened the container and was really disappointed by their version of the mixed vegetables.  There was only cabbage and a few strands of onion...($1.99 for mixed veggies).  I think if you were going to charge this price..at least add a few for types of veggies..broccoli, bean sprouts ...carrots..something..not just plain cabbage that costs pennies on the dollar.. If you are in the area, like this sort of Hawaiian food ...the portion is okay...decent flavor & its still way better than L&L.  Unfortunately I don't like how this place does business.   Ross J's=You are still my #1 favorite..  Thumbs down...",

If it's just me and the wife, we'll split the adobo fried rice omelet (you win, spell check)  and we might even have some left over to bring to the hotel for a lil snacking later. If it's me and my bro, one of us gets the omelet and the other gets the loco moco and that's usually enough for the both of us. They haven't made me pay extra for asking for a little more adobo in the omelet but please don't ask for this yourself. I feel special. =P To say the food is delicious is an understatement. Since being turned on to the place by our friends, we've yet to make a Vegas trip without stopping here at least once.   I have no complaints whatsoever about anything here.  Parking is plentiful in the lot out front. The service is friendly from the cashier to the serving of your food. The bathrooms are clean. Yes, I've used both (couldn't wait).

I've eaten here a few times and don't get me wrong the food tastes good, but it definitely doesn't stand out compared to other Hawaiian restaurants like 808 Mixed Plate, Island Flavor, or Aloha Specialties.  The place does have Filipino bias as well for some of their dishes compared to other Hawaiian spots...ie Adobo Fried Rice Omelette and other Filipino dishes I can't spell.   I've tried the garlic chicken plate here....and I honestly probably wouldn't order it again...the brown gravy just wasn't appetizing on this dish.  I've also tried the kalbi which seems on par with restaurants like L&L.  My favorite dish was the portuguese sausage, eggs, rice...but you can't really mess that up.  If I'm on a time crunch...I'd probably come here and order to go....but I definitely don't think I'll be craving food from Aloha Kitchen...just like I don't have urges to go to L&L when there are other options out there.",

There are a few that especially stand out. The chicken katsu is the absolute best katsu I have ever tasted in my life. It is not some thin breaded, greasy chicken piece of crap like most places will serve you. It is a juicy chicken thigh breaded to perfection and sliced up. This is definitely my favorite dish. Also, the BBQ chicken is quite tasty. They always grill it fresh which is awesome, but it can take awhile to get to you. It takes about 20 minutes to make, but it is worth the wait. Can't forget the student special; for under 5 bucks you get a teriyaki chicken bowl and a drink. It is enough to fill you up on the cheap.  On the other hand, I have been there a couple times and the food was not fresh and it tasted like straight shat. This only happened to me a couple of times out of the hundreds of times I have been there. It seems this tends to happen when it is busy during lunch time, so try to avoid lunch time.",

    "text": "Overview:  Being a UNLV alumni I of course have eaten many a meal at Aloha Kitchen.  It is cheap, but I'll warn you now, for each item that is of wonderful quality and taste, there is an item that is equally bland, fake, or just plain bad.  It is a Filipino owned establishment, so the Filipino items tend to be good, while the flavors that I grew up with in Hawaii are often a disappointment.  I miss Diamond Head grill, which was across the street from UNLV.  Their Hawaii food blew Aloha Kitchen out of the water, but the owners moved away and I was left with just the Aloha.  Location:  The restaurant is on Maryland Parkway, north of Tropicana.  For all you poor college students, it's to the east of the southern dorms, south of In and out burger, and north east of the architecture building.  When you're on campus, the strip is west of you.  Hopefully that helps.  Exterior:  Your standard strip mall restaurant.  There is minimal outside decor, glass store front, and a door.  Interior:  They are really going for the Hawaii feel here, but it looks nothing like any restaurant that I have ever eaten in whileI lived all my life in Hawaii.  It screams fake Hawaii.  Corny.    Service:  You order at the counter for takeout and dine in.  If it is a takeout order, there are a few seats that you can sit in while you wait for your food.  For dine in, you get a plastic number that you take to your table with you.  You get your own drink and the only service I ever seem to get is when the food is dropped to our table.  Sometimes I wonder if I should even leave a tip for that.  The attitude of the service really depends on the workers.  Some are really friendly, others are just plain b####s.  The manager, an Asian guy, is the nicest guy.  Food:  Like I started off with, they make some really good stuff, and some really bad stuff.  The good stuff first.  They make some great Kalbi.  It is tasty and charred just the right amount to add the perfect flavor to it.  The Adobo anything will always seem to be a winner (adobo fried rice, adobo omelets, etc.).    Now I will move onto the bad.  Musubis are simple and normally delicious, but I don't like the way they make theirs.  They make it fresh which should be a good thing; however, this does not allow the steam of what should be freshly cooked rice to soften the nori.  Now I've heard people say they like the fresh nori, but I feel the nori on the outside of a musubi should not be tough and chewy.  I'm sorry, but growing up with the stuff I am just against that.  The solution would be to just wrap it in plastic wrap as soon as you make it to trap the steam inside to soften the nori, then unwrap after about three minutes and serve.    Also, they seem to use ready made sauces.  If not, then they have pretty accurately duplicated the taste of Kikkoman teriyaki sauce.  The thing that used to piss me off was that they would not marinate their meats (except the Kalbi).  If you ordered Teriyaki chicken, you would get a bland piece of chicken with Kikkoman sauce poured over it.  I used to work at some higher end Hawaii restaurants in my day, and when I saw this I wanted to throw my plate.  How hard is it to put meat into a sauce and leave it there for 30 or more minutes so the flavor gets in the meat?    Summary:  I'm going to be as positive as I can be here and focus on the good.  The price is pretty decent and on most days the staff will be friendly.  What they made well taste outstanding and comes out fairly quick.  Since in Hawaii presentation equals portion size and not prettiness, the presentation here is great.  They give you a good amount of food for the money.  This is a blessing for any college student.    Will I eat here again? No, since there are far better Hawaii restaurants in the Valley.  Would I recommend it?  Only to students who don't have a car and can't drive to Ross J's, Island Flavors, or the California Hotel.  This place is becoming more and more a chain.  This saddens me.  Why can't a restaurant with some actually Great Hawaii food become a chain?",

I loved the spam dishes, and adored the chicken katsu...I also am still frequently tempted by the kalua pig and cabbage...However, now that I am vegetarian, I've only been back twice. The most recent trip about a week ago, I enjoyed stir fried veggies, rice and the veggie egg rolls. The stir fried veggies (made with butter) and rice were absolutely delicious. My only complaint is that the diversity of veggies in the stir fry is very limited to cabbage, carrots, and maybe some peppers. I love the way AK makes their rice, and had no complaints. The portion size was also massive. As for the egg rolls, they just didn't do it for me. They were cooked okay, but were pretty bland, and the sauce with them didn't really help.  The service at AK has always been good, and this was no exception.  I dined with a co-worker, and a family from the mid-west who we had just met. The family loved their food, and thought it was very flavorful. So, if you are not used to Hawaiian food, this place could change your life.  I am glad to know I can get full on a plate of veggies and rice, with enough left over to take home for all under $6.50.",

Maybe I'll return to try something more interesting, but I'm not in a huge hurry to do so. I hate downgrading, but today's visit was kind of icky.  I had a student special again, this time with added vegetables.  They drowned the vegetables in more gooey teriyaki sauce (the chicken bowl last time had just enough to be tasty), and they were blah vegetables (celery and cabbage, just short of overcooked) at that.",

    "text": "Aloha Kitchen definitely satisfied my longest craving for local Hawaiian food.  Living on the East Coast does take a toll on the Local when it comes to food, and I knew that one of my biggest priorities when visiting Vegas was to find good Hawaiian grinds.  I found Aloha Kitchen on a random google search.  It was also the place of choice because it's about a 10-15 minute bus ride from the airport on the 109.  This is great for those of us who are cheap and like to save money by not renting a car and utilizing public transportation.  And, it literally drops you off right across the street.  The food selection was plentiful, so I had a really hard time deciding on something.  I ended up ordering a Hawaiian plate that included laulau, kalua pig, and the usual scoops of rice and ono mac salad.  In addition, I also ordered a couple of manapuas.  I tried to order poke, but they already ran out--and it was only noon!  You know when something runs out that quick, it has to be good.  Great for them, bad for me, I guess!  The funny thing is that I kept thinking \"you can't screw up laulau and kalua pig\", but then I had to remind of myself that you CAN.  It wasn't dry, too salty, or even mushy, which are sometimes an issue.  It was just like how it is back home in Hawai'i.  My partner had the katsu/curry plate really liked it.  Unfortunately, I was too much of a pig indulging in my meal to sample from his plate, so I personally can't attest to its goodness.    Would I go back there again?  Absolutely!  Great location, great price, ono food--what else do you need?  Oh yes, the employees were very nice, too!",

The lady at the register, Florie told us that they were going to put the food inside of a to go box which was fine and that we were allowed to stay and eat in the designated area. When I finally got my food at 10pm, one of the other workers told us that we had to leave. My friend was in the middle of eating too. Unfortunately, we ended up leaving and packed up. There were about two people waiting for their food. I don't know why it was a problem. Where's the Aloha at???",

I was stoked, because this is one of my favorite Hawaiian food places in the valley.    The location is definitely located in a sketchy area.  Next to In-N-Out on Maryland and Tropicana, I feel like they were trying to target the students at UNLV.  I feel bad for someone walking to location at night.  Definitely a dangerous looking area.  The reason for my low score is the staff.  There's a little Filipino looking girl with a name starting with a V (I think Veronica) that works there.  First off, when there are a lot of people in line, she definitely seems to crack under pressure.  No smile, no small talk, sighing at requests all the time and giving attitude.  I was not a fan at all.  I was even going to go as far as to send a message to the owner of the restaurant, informing them of this rude behavior.  I was with a group of 20.  I understand that amount can get super overwhelming, however, she is definitely in the industry to create the best experience for every customer.  At one point, I asked her for more water as the pitchers on the side were empty.  She looked at me, rolled her eyes, sighed a little and took the pitcher from my hands.  LIVID I was!  Now that I'm done ranting, here's what I got:  For lunch, I got the Aloha plate for $7.99 and (2) spam musubis for $1.99 each.  The musubi was super good!  Different textures like the sticky rice, fried and salty spam and the crunchy seaweed that held everything together!  Although I ordered the Aloha plate, when I got back to the gym, I discovered that I actually got the adobo plate!  I was so pissed because that's not what I wanted!!!  In the adobo plate, though, it comes with a bunch of pork chunks cooked in vinegar and soy sauce, with two scoops of rice.  What made me more mad was the fact that the adobo to me was dry.  It came in a to-go bowl with lots of the soup it was cooked in, however, the meat was still dryer than I'm used to.  Not happy at all.    I love me some Aloha Kitchen, however, I was not a fan of this place at all.  I know they usually do a great job at the other locations so I'm not going to refrain from coming back just because of this experience.  This location, however, needs to get it together and step up the service!",

I will say, I have not been back since May. That particular time, it was a Sunday afternoon having lunch with a friend. It was understaffed. My cashier was also my server, which was strange.  I ordered Pork Lau Lau which is pork wrapped in leaves. I only got it because I liked the name. The server helped serve me and unwrapped the food. I ate it and did not enjoy it much. It was worse that night when I got some of the worst food poisoning of my life.   Either the pork wasn't cooked all the way or the server hadn't washed his hands after handling all that money and it contaminated the food. That was just my last experience. Every other time was an okay experience.   I would just shy away from getting the more exotic foods.",

    "text": "I have been going to Aloha kitchen for years now and it certainly does fit into the budget of college students who order the student special, which consist of a Teriyaki chicken and a fountain drink. The chicken is pretty tasty and comes with the skin on, however if you're trying to be healthy you can ask for no skin. I have ordered it without the skin and it's just not the same and isn't as good. If you don't opt for the drink it's even cheaper which is just $4 and some change. When I'm broke I actually don't mind not getting a drink because the water cups are readily available at the counter. Service is nice because your food is delivered to you at your table. This is also a popular spot for pick up orders and I do recommend calling ahead of time because everything is made to order. This place gets pretty packed for lunch which is good they have the extended dinning area. I've tried a number of items here and I must say my favorite is the KALBI. It is so tasty especially with the sauce they service on the side and the green onions they use to garnish it with. I can honestly they make the best Kalbi in comparison to other places (like Korean) I have tried it at. The best part is it's only $8 which is good because Kalbi is usually pricier at Korean spots. I live near this location so I frequent here quit often. 3.5 stars but I'll round up to 4 since it's a family owned business.",

    "text": "I'm giving this restaurant 4 stars because I had only one experience and that was ordering platters of food for a party which ended up quite delicious, I must say.  I was in Vegas recently for a birthday party and decided to have the party in our room instead of at a restaurant and ordered 3 platters.  Teri Chicken, Fried Noodles, and Egg Rolls.  Let me backtrack by saying that I came across Aloha Kitchen by accident, just driving around looking for somewhere to buy the food since I really didn't do much research beforehand.  After having bought a few things from Vons down the street, Aloha Kitchen caught my eye as I was driving along and since I was in a crunch, thought why not check it out since I was sure I'd be familiar with the food.  I asked if they sold platters and was given a party platter menu.  There were quite a few choices but I was a little hesitant at first because of the prices.  $60 for a large platter of Teri Chicken and Fried Saimin, and $40 for 100 pcs of Egg Rolls.  I was expecting 30 people.  I asked how long to make them and was told 30-40 mins.  I ordered and went about my business taking a little less than an hour before going back to pick up my order.  When I arrived, my order was ready and to my surprise, it was a lot larger than I thought it was going to be.  Of course I had to sample them and found that all items were quite tasty.  The Teri Chicken was lightly breaded and the sauce served on the side, every piece of Egg Rolls were cooked golden brown and crispy with a sweet chili sauce served on the side, and the Fried Saimin were mixed with a surprising amount of Charsiu Pork, as well as cabbage and egg.    I ended up pleasantly surpised, having a lot of left over food and felt that it was well worth the price.   In summary, considering the fact that I stopped in by chance and had no idea what this place was like, I was quite satisfied with my experience and would eat there again based on the food alone and would definitely order platters from them again.  The next time, I'll probably sit and eat in, and after reading previous reviews, I sincerely hope the service issues has been resolved and that my experience will be just as satisfying.",

Just be careful, it comes really hot so you might want it to cool down a bit -Parking easy - Plenty room to eat -Quick and polite service  Cons: -my only con was that they had a variety of hawaiian sun drinks but no pog! how are you going to be a hawaiian place with no pog! that klnda disappointed but not enough to knock out a star  Definitely will make this a routine of making this place my first place to hit up when i get to vegas.

    "text": "Back when I lived on the east coast, I was never really aware of how popular hawaiian food was. When I moved to the west coast, it was like discovering a new world. I had never heard of dishes like Loco Moco or Saimin, although I had heard of Spam Musubi. So when I first started visiting Vegas with my bf, he introduced me to this place.   If you read my previous reviews, I get really excited about hold in the wall restaurants because they tend to have the best of the best. This is a really small restaurant located near the university so I figured it would be popular with students. They even have student lunch specials! It's one of those restaurants where you order at the register and you seat yourself.   My bf really wanted the Loco Moco and recommended I try the Adobo Fried Rice. What he described to me was something I couldn't fathom--until I saw it with my own eyes. Chicken Adobo fried rice encased in an egg omelet?? Yes, please!!! Although our entree portions weren't as large as other places, I wasn't complaining. It was enough.   I had high hopes for our food based on looks alone. Unfortunately, I was disappointed about the taste. I had to add loads of sriracha sauce to complement both dishes.   Although it wasn't the worst experience I've had, I've found other hawaiian restaurants I'd rather visit since. If you haven't experienced Hawaiian food, you could try this place. But to be honest, I'd drive further to eat somewhere else.",

Just lost a regular customer forever. Tonight I made a phone order like I usually do and I ordered a chicken katsu with a large drink on the side. I came in and paid for my food and drove home. (Mind you I live on the other side of town) I got home and I noticed I was missing my side Mac Salad. I gave the store a call to notify them that they had forgotten my Mac Salad on the side. When I called, the receptionist picked up and gave me attitude saying \"oh I forgot\" really!?!? No apologies were said and she also said \"well there's really nothing we can do\" I had then got fed up with her attitude and asked to speak to a manager. The manager got on the phone and didn't even give me a chance to speak. He was like \"I heard what happened and all we can do for you is give you a side of Mac Salad when you come back here\" on top of that he kept asking me \"what would you like me to do for you\" but says that's all we can pretty much do. I mean why would you even ask me that question in the first place if you can't promise me anything!?!? Ridiculous!!! He was very rude and he also didn't apologize for their mistake!!! Which pissed me off even more. To top things off, when I was on the phone with the manager he was like \"how ironic that you called about this because supposedly there is another customer that just walked in here with the same issue about a week ago that was in the store picking up his Mac Salad that they forgot to bag. I know it's really not a big deal because I understand that people make mistakes and sometimes forget but what really got to me was their lack of customer service and how rude they all were. Coming from Hawaii I thought they would show me some Aloha and treat me like Ohana but I guess I was wrong. The workers here need to be more respectful and learn how to do their jobs. It's not that hard to put food in a bag with utensil's and side dishes. Not coming to this location ever again!!! There's a lot of other local food places here in Vegas and they will be seeing me a lot more.",

It was a bit off putting.   However, this place is cheap, so for the price it was warranted.",

However, as soon as I walked in I was greeted by a nice guy saying \"aloha\". I thought it was comical. He recommended, seeing that I am a younger guy, that I try out their Ribs, so I did. They were everything I could ever expect from this place. He gave me a tip to use the sauce on the side of rice as well as the ribs. Let me tell you, it was a phenomenal meal. Each rib is sliced so that you can easily eat them with one hand and the meat comes right off of the bone. Overall, the food is awesome and definitely a good spot to grab food if you're in the area looking around. Also, try one of their Hawaiian drinks, they're delicious. I had the guava puree one and it was amazing. Overall, I came in expecting average and left saying Wow.",

We are all consumers & are spending our money to trust these restaurants to give us quality service and food. I dined with aloha kitchen recently & ordered the fried saimin, being from Hawaii you will never get the authentic thing but crave comfort food & you entrust local restaurants to help fill the void. Let's just say it was the complete opposite, after receiving my food via post mates, my friends and I would come to experience such a horrific & terrible food quality & probably even safety problem. My fried saimin looked alright at first, but then as I was eating it I came to realize I had chewed one something crunchy, as I spit it out what did I discover? Metal Brissels from like a scrubbing device to wash your dishes with !! Steel wool some may call it !! Disgusted I didn't even wanna tell my friends and ruin there appetite but I had to, my friend ordered a loco moco and it was dry and oily and also received a piece of French fry in it ! How is there a French fry in there when no one else ordered fries !! And it was mixed in the gravy, yuckkkk. Save your money & time and go somewhere else. I'm tempted to call the health department & let them know what happened. I'm pretty sure if they come thru they will be in for special surprise.",

Aloha kitchen, may not have the ambience nor aesthetic flare but what it has is REALLY GOOD comfort food! It is a mom and pop joint that has really kicked up Islander Fusion food. The food plating isn't at all fancy but the portion size surely makes up for it. I ordered the chicken katsu with curry over a bed of rice, the adobo omelette fried rice and the banana macadamia pancakes covered with vanilla sauce. The food was enough to feed 4 people. Chicken katsu is chicken katsu, there is no messing around with it As for the curry sauce, should I say it was a traditional home style curry with chunks of potato and carrots. The adobo omelette fried rice, had a subtle adobo flavor. In my opinion, it would have tasted better if they drizzled adobo sauce on top of the omelette to give it depth. As for the banana macadamia pancakes, it was fluffy, and the flavor met the expectations of the description . Oh, and the vanilla sauce was not drizzled but poured over the hot cakes. It was delicious! I also had the opportunity to talk with the owner, whom everyone referred to as \" Uncle\". We conversed for a bit and even shared recipes. Uncle, was extremely gracious, friendly and welcomed each customer as a guest, in True \" Islander\" style. I give this place a BIG  up! Remember, to stop by Uncle's when you are in town.  Mahalo from Ms. BUddahBelly's belly!",

Though I was not hungover during my visit, my custom adobe rice order with adobo meat and egg on top could be the perfect remedy to a hangover or a hungry stomach, and highly recommended.    Aloha Kitchen has some of the best Filipino adobo meat around.  The texture is comparable to pulled pork or lau lau.  Get their popular egg omelette filled with fried adobo rice, a must have eat when you're in Vegas or to go order on your way home.  If you want another taste of heaven, get their banana pancake.  I'm not fond of bananas or banana bread, but this will make you a fan.  The sauce combined with fresh doughy pancakes with a slight hint of banana will make you want to come back for more.  With these two awesome dishes alone plus their good service and great home cooking, Aloha Kitchen should get no less than 5 stars.",

    "text": "Eek! Even the newly remodeled interior couldn't save this place from their horrible customer service. The two people working the front had no smile, monotone voices, and a bad attitude.   The one guy called my order out when it was ready, rolled his eyes that I took a minute to receive it and then he handed it off to me without making sure that I had a hold on the food, then didn't say a word once it finally got to me.   I got the adobo fried rice omelette, which was okay. It definitely needed much more than a squirt of Sriracha sauce to make it taste better. I received the omelette messily thrown into the to-go box. Presentation is also part of the equation for an overall good experience and it was not there for this dish. At least it was a generous portion for a semi-decent price.  They sell Hawaiian Suns here, so don't forget to buy one to enjoy with your meal!   If I'm ever near/on campus or need a lunch in between class that isn't fast food, I'll go here but I'll definitely be cautious of the staff. Other than that, there are other places for Hawaiian fare around the area that's probably a bit better than here.",

I decided to go for the combo plate consisting of kalbi and chicken teriyaki.   The kalbi. WOW. So tender with each bite and full of flavor. They offer plenty of it which was to my surprise. For the teriyaki chicken, it doesn't get any better. It's juicy and has a nice crisp to the skin. They only thing I would do different is ask them to make the chicken teriyaki crispier. For my plate, I opted for no Katsu and double the chicken teriyaki.   I'll be back to try some of the Filipino food. They have 5 locations in the Las Vegas area. So I recommend trying one most convenient to you. The prices and reasonable and the portions are big.",

Some days I come in and uncle working the register is on top of his game! He is so nice and urgent with your order. But most days when there's other cashiers there's no greeting or smiling. Last visit I came in and they didn't even say anything, just stood there and awkwardly waited for me to order. My regular is the adobo fried rice omelet so when I told the guy may I please have the adobo fried rice, in a rude way he responds, \"you mean adobo OMELET?\" ...awkwardly I said yeah but was thinking isn't that the same thing? I don't know but braddah made me feel dumb when he emphasized the omelet so I just ignored it, paid, and sat down at my table lol   Food is good, after coming here for 5 years their adobo omelet has been consistently delicious. However, their BBQ chicken has changed. It went from being juicy to just plain dry over the years so I stopped ordering it. Their drink machines is free refills and they sell Aloha juices by the can. To a certain extent their food hits close to home, only improvement should be some of the cashiers.",

In this plaza, you will also find Baja Bar & Grill, Firehouse Subs, and Smashburger. If you're looking for a quick Hawaiian fix, then Aloha Kitchen is the right choice!  I usually go for the adobo fried omelette, which is basically exactly what it sounds like. If they have it, sometimes I go for the oxtail soup. Some say it can be a little fatty, but I would say it's a lottle fatty. They give you a huge bowl with some piece of oxtail meat and another bowl of rice. Sometimes I can't finish it and bring the rest of it home!  This location isn't 24 hours like the other one in the Henderson area. There are plenty of tables and booths to sit in, however, it can get pretty busy during lunch time!",

Although this is a Hawaiian restaurant, they have Filipino food as well as you can hear some of the workers speaking Tagalog.  PROs: the adobo omelette is a must have when in Vegas and is just a short drive of a couple miles off the strip. \"Silog\" breakfast items are available to choose from - tapsilog, longsilog, cornbeefsilog.  Dishes are not too salty and the tapsilog was flavorful.  Tapsilog came with a little of garlic vinegar and ketchup.  CONs: the side booths were a little snug for space.  Was looking for more adobo flavors in the adobo omelette just like I remembered the first time I was here.  Tapsilog was flavorful but small in quantity. Also, would have preferred garlic rice with our \"silog\" plates.    I'll be back, hoping the next time my adobo omelette is just as flavorful as it was before.",

    "text": "Stopped by here before heading back to LA. I saw Yelp reviews and pictures but nothing prepares you for their portion sizes and how good it tastes!!   First off, parking is not bad. It is located in a plaza which has lots of space and other food places if you wanted to try something else.   The inside is very spacious and looks like they might have remodeled some parts. When we arrived it was pretty busy but we were able to find a seat quickly.   I ordered the Local Plate. The portion size was HUGE! It comes with 2 spam musubi's, teriyaki chicken, and teriyaki beef! Would definitely recommend!   My bf ordered the Adobo fried rice omelette which is pretty popular on the menu. Again the portion size was huge and way bigger if you dine in. I thought it was okay. Too much rice in my option and not enough of the omelette. Also the flavor was bland in the fried rice. I added hot sauce which made it better.  Our friends ordered a different type of meat and I felt like that one had more flavor.   Overall great place to try if you are in the area!!",

I went with it because I thought it would be done different than let's say traditional teriyaki chicken. Silly me. It was pretty standard and I could've gotten the same thing anywhere else. Probably much better. I would will not be returning to this chain most likely. I do not recommend it.",

The staff is very friendly and kind, though. Their demeanor alone makes me a fan.  I'm not a big fan of Loco Moco in general, so I don't consider myself a good judge of what's good or not, but I finished my plate! Why did I order it? If they can make me a fan of something I don't usually enjoy, that would really say something...too bad it didn't quite work.  My wife got the longanisa, which was on the sweet side, so I thoroughly enjoyed it. If it's any indication of how good their Portuguese sausage is, I'll definitely be back.  We shared a short stack of the banana pancakes and two spam musubis, both of which were really good.  Overall, it's a great place, I just wasn't blown away, hence the 3-star. It's only my first experience, though. Maybe it'll change...",

I ordered the \"Aloha Plate\" and they gave me small chopped up servings of each item. The chicken katsu consist of a small mini chicken chopped up, along with another small teriyaki chicken chopped up, and on top of it was the chopped up beef with grave sauce.  That was NOT the teri beef we all here up eating in Hawaii. That beef was more like the beef stew type of meat. The owner probably trying to save money by using the cheaper type of beef. The plate did not look appealing! The rice was okay not the greatest!  The mac salad was not like how they make it in Hawaii... Not good! One more thing, is the Katsu sauce...they use barbeque sauce instead of the real katsu sauce in Hawaii.. It's better to eat at L&Ls Hawaiian Barbeque versus here",

Sure, it's a little far from where we were staying but it was totally worth it. The service was fast and everyone was friendly. The teriyaki bowl was a huge portion and I was only  able to finish half. My friends got soup and Loco Moco. Both looked delicious, I was also pleased to see they sold Oxtail soup, I wasn't in the mood but next time for sure I will be giving that a try. I even ordered food to go for my fiance, he was reeeeaaaal pleased to find food upon waking from his long drunken beauty sleep. He gave me two thumbs up, only downside I would say is that their spam masubi contains way too much rice and very little spam. Parking was also plenty. If your in the area (even if you aren't!) do come by and eat, you won't be disappointed, way better than L&L's in my opinion!",

    "text": "This place is not too bad; haven't tried many Hawaiian food places while I've been here except for the marketplace cafe in the California hotel, and the lnl on S. Maryland. Out of all three, this was prob the furthest from tasting like the food from back home. I got the local plate which consisted of 2 spam musubis, Mac salad, and Teri chxn/beef.  Musubis: they were okay, but nori and spam were quite soggy prob due to the over use of Teri sauce  Mac salad: not that great..lacked flavor and had a salty base..texture of noodles were nice and firm though!   Teri chicken: usually Teri chxn is bbq'd or something..but idk, the one from here was fried (I'm guessing) which I found interesting, and it was covered with gooey overpowering Teri sauce, which was extra sweet and salty    Teri beef: same as the chicken in terms of that gooey overpowering Teri sauce..the texture of the beef was good though   Overall this place was literally not bad nor was it good. Lol. I mean nothing can compare to food back home, but honestly I would prob goto lnl or the California for better stuff !",

    "text": "I must admit Hawaiian food is a great way to end a shenanigan-filled weekend in Vegas. Hearty and full of carbs and protein, it pretty much could be a soupless alternative to pho as a hangover helper.  I ordered the Pork Lau Lau since I've been craving it for the longest time. It comes with two scoops of rice and macaroni salad. The pork came out tender and the taro leaves were nice and soft. Not bad for Vegas.  It's in a random strip mall next to UNLV, prices are pretty affordable for what you get. People keep mentioning the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette? Guess I'll have to try that next time I'm in Vegas. And knowing me, I'll be back sooner than later...  P.S. I remember seeing a banner for a student special too if you still have that Student ID of yours!",

My go to dish will have to be the Adobo omelette fried rice which is rich in flavor and always a must eat when your in town. I usually dine in and order one to go for the drive home to Cali. Hopefully you guys open one in California",

    "text": "In Vegas for NBA Summer League.  Aloha Kitchen near Thomas Mack arena so figured I'd check out out.  When I went in, I saw menu items such as a Bento and a Mixed Plate. Don't see items like that except for Hawaii, so I was excited that the restaurant might have some fairly authentic Hawaiian style food. Unfortunately what I ordered was not. I ordered the Mixed Plate which was teriyaki beef, teriyaki chicken, and mahi-mahi.  Thr beef and chicken were prepared with a very sweet teriyaki glaze poured on top.  (Like Flame Broiler,  if you've ever been to one. )  A lot of places that have mahi-mahi n the menu now use  substitue fish such as Swai. The counter person insisted they used mahi-mahi.  I'm pretty sure it wasn't.  The food wasn't really bad.   But it wasn't very good either.   And if you are looking for authentic hawaiian food, I'm not sure this is the place.",

Fried Portuguese sausage is Hawaii. Uncle\"s grilled pork was the best. Well marinated, tender, and grilled to perfection. The Korean ribs was actually better than mine... Hahaha! No, I make the best Korean bbq ribs. The best part is the food at aloha kitchen is tasty and plentiful. Definitely a go-to-place after a night of partying and gambling! Awesome place!",
