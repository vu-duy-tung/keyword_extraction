Even my parents loved it that we had to go two days in a row to confirm it was good.  Come in and was seated right away. Service is nice and friendly. They leave the pitcher of coffee on the table which is nice to. First time here the waiter offered us there famous banana nut muffin. We don't really eat muffins but we finished this in no time it was that good. I haven't had anything like it to be honest. Same goes for my parents they never eat that stuff but boy did they love it. I ordered scrambled eggs with mushrooms tomatoes and spinach. My dad ordered the Mexican omelette and my mom ordered scrambled eggs and potatoes. The potatoes are to die for. The best I've had. Must be the seasoning but damn it was that good. The eggs were good the toast was good so I need to say more. I couldn't finish it good portions. All around we left satisfied, full and not heavy. We were able to stay full for the rest of the day till night time. Overall highly recommended because I don't really rave about breakfast but this place was that good",

The meat was cut with a fork tender and the Potatoes were really good with the seasoning that they use on them. They sell the seasoning at the counter if you would like to take some home. The only gripe that I have is that they don't get the butter to the edges on their toast. This is one of my pet peaves that really bothers me.",

Ordered the Sunrise Mountain which is funny because I love a butter croissant it came with home fries turkey bacon eggs n cheese and I should have shared with my boyfriend he ordered stuffed french toast & he didn't finish his food either.

The menu, although extensive, had a lot of repeated ingredients that were just served differently. I'd like a smaller menu with a little more creativity.   Their biscuits and gravy are delicious though.  All around, it's a good casual place to eat with friends and family.",

Although I've never had lunch here I can tell you I have been having breakfast here for a very long time. My favorite thing to order for breakfast is Chorizo & Eggs. From time to time I also like to order the Patriot Belgian Waffle which is very good. I also like the Viva La France French Toast two pieces of brioche bread dipped in homemade batter and griddled golden brown. If you like omelettes I would recommend two, first the Egg-Ceptional Omelette (Sausage, Smoked Ham, Crisp Bacon, House-Roasted Onions, Tomatoes and Crimini Mushrooms with melted Jack and Cheddar) topped with sour cream and fresh herbs. Served with dressed greens and an English muffin. It's very good and possibly their most popular Omelette. My personal favorite is the Mexican Omelette (Chorizo, Chiles, House-Roasted Onions, Jack and Cheddar) topped with salsa or pork green chili, sour cream and fresh herbs. Served with seasoned ranch potatoes and a flour tortilla. It's delicious. If you happen to be a breakfast person this place is a must try.",

I ordered the Eggs Benedict and my boyfriend had one of their scrambles. My boyfriend LOVED his food however, mine was not the best. The sauce was really \"oily\" which upset my stomach, and the rest of the food was extremely bland.  They do have their own branded hot sauces which are really great.

I for some reason had some very bad luck when it comes to the white gravy with country fried steak but this gravy was awesome and the fried steak was great. I ordered the fruits(yes I know) but it kinda went better for me as I thought everything was very heavy so the fruits at the end of the meal helped me. Also, I really loved their salsa. It was super good that I actually considering buying a bottle but I don't think I would add salsa to any chinese food at all so I didn't get it.  Regardless, I think Egg & I is great. They make simple/homey food great and that's why it deserves a 4 star.",

    "text": "Yay breakfast! Unfortunately everyone thought the same thing too. It was bumpin' in here but the waitresses were hauling ASS to get everyone in. Jaime and I waited about 10 minutes before being seated, but it was well worth the wait.   First off: check in offer is a banana nut muffin. When it came to the table it was warm and oh my god, so good.  It's gotta be made with some sort of whole wheat or bran flour cuz it's a dark looking muffin.  It's so moist (sorry, had to do it) and dense yet light, sweet but not too much, and just literally the perfect muffin.    I asked our waitress, Karla, for some coffee and I was treated to my own thermos of it, score! There's a little egg symbol on the table that once it's switched to the other color it signifies that the table needs attending to. Jaime wanted an ice tea refill and flipped the egg over. Within seconds another waitress (Karla was busy) was at our table to help.  What a great team!  I ordered the Veggie Eggs Benny and was so pleased with it! It's two poached eggs on top of a split english muffin, with grilled tomatoes, avocado, and spinach.  The best though was dipping those seasoned potatoes into the hollandaise sauce. They're fried and perfect to dip into a yolk too.   You won't leave here hungry, that's for sure!",

    "text": "Food: Cold. Must have been left in the window for too long. Didn't end up sending anything back because we waited about 30 minutes for the dishes to be served and were too hungry to bother.   Atmosphere: Dirty and chaotic. Clearly disorganized. Ketchup bottle was covered in icing (?) and the table felt sticky. Unsure if anything had been wiped down before we were seated. Observed a server tossing a drink out to the bushes as she was cleaning up. Left under the impression that the staff doesn't care much for the guest experience.   Service: Inconsistent. Our server was friendly, however the young girl who took our payment at the counter was pushy and clearly unhappy to be at work. I get that it was New Year's Eve, but it was at 2:30 in the afternoon -- no reason to be so miserable and inhospitable. Perhaps she could use some coaching around how important the final interaction is with the guest, as it should always be positive in order to leave a lasting impression on their experience.   I had a similar experience at their sister restaurant Eggworks. Needless to say, I will not be returning to either place.",

Egg & I has always had excellent service in the morning, until my last time there. The service was beyond exceptional, we had a server named Manuela, she made sure that we were well taken care of, always made sure that we were satisfied. My father and I who work in customer service for well over 40 combined years, were both extremely pleased with the level of customer service that was given to us. Not only was the customer service amazing, the food was great as well. They could have served us the worst possible food, and we probably still would have gone back there. My father always told me, you can't fix customer service with good food, but you can good food with excellent customer service. I highly recommend coming here. I ordered my usual eggs benedict, and it was just amazing, and a banana nut muffin, and the taste was so perfect, even Gordon Ramsay would have complimented the chef. We ended up walking out of Egg & I, tipping 75% just because we enjoyed the customer service and the food.",

Kay's special is an omlette with artichokes, spinach, parmesan cheese, cream cheese topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese. I was looking for something different and not what I would usually order, which is 2 eggs with toast and pancakes. I was pleasantly surprised! It was flavorful, and delicious. The feta cheese on top which I was concerned about was fantastic. I think that might have actually been the best part. I really really enjoyed it. My husband's dish was equally delicious. I was worried there would be too much salsa, but not at all. The side of potatoes were a touch salty. I would have preferred just a little less seasoning however, everything was really really good. They serve a muffin of the day before they serve your order. Todays' was banana nut muffin. It was good. I was happy that the wait was rather quick, especially for a Saturday morning. The menu has many offerings so really, no matter what you like for breakfast, I'm sure you can find it there. Our server was also very nice and quick.",

From the outside, the place looks very unassuming. Not even busy. But right when we opened the door, crowds poured out, and we had to wait nearly 20 minutes for a table for two. The wall decor by the waiting place was cute. There were cartoons as well as sayings about eggs. Finally, we were led to our table by a super friendly and bubbly waitress.  The menu is printed like a newspaper - cool!! I've never seen that before!! (Yes I took a picture with it.) The selection is pretty extensive considering that every single item on the menu are made with eggs (like skillet items, omelettes, etc), so it took us a while to decide. I forget what we ended up getting - it was a while ago, pardon me - but I remember it being soooo good! They also customize your order so that you can have whole eggs vs egg substitutes vs egg whites, etc... Definitely get the fresh banana nut bread!! We almost got a loaf to take home back to LA even though we weren't leaving for LA yet.  The service was superb. Our waitress kept coming by to check up on us. When the busboy accidentally tossed our leftovers, the waitress felt so bad that she went back to the kitchen and got us some other foods to take with us. This was one place where I seriously went in not expecting much and left completely satisfied with the full intention of coming back next time I am in Vegas.",

My favorite is the Kay's special with the banana nut muffin. If you have a sweet tooth, you should definitely go for the muffin instead of the toast. It's fresh and moist.  This place is not on the cheap side (you know it's LV) but the food quality and service sure deserve it.",

Please don't let the name fool you this is not the chain \"The Egg and I\" it is independent and shows it. The quality is top notch. The portions are huge and the service is great. My personal favorite menu item is the Cincinnati chili. The have it as a omelet, a burrito ad as the traditional 3, 4, or 5 way. The best I have found outside of Cincy. As to the breakfasts the potatoes they include with almost every item are outstanding but if you ask for fruit they give you a huge plate of fruit that most places would call a fruit salad and charge 6-7 bucks for. This place is simply the best in Vegas",

I was not disappointed as the food was fresh and the menu selection for breakfast was excellent. I ordered the veggie omelette and it was served with a huge portion of home fires. As others have commented the home fries are highly seasoned with seasoning salt so I enjoyed them. The veggie omelette had a generous amount of chopped veggies inside and they melt jack and cheddar cheese over the top. The meal is served with toast or their famous banana nut muffin and the muffin is light and packed with flavor. I was very hungry today but I left very full and satisfied. The prices are very reasonable and my breakfast inlcuding a drink came to a toal of $10.00. I will definitely be back on my next trip to LV.",

But the feel of the restaurant was very similar. Our server was very attentive. We ordered the Sundance Omlette and the Traditional Benny and added avocado.   I thought everything was fine, the only reason I gave this place 4 stars instead of 5 is because there is nothing special about it. Just another breakfast place. However, I do love that it is family-owned and has multiple locations around the city. I don't regret stopping by. Breakfast is my favorite meal of the day!",

In any event, came to this popular locals' spot in LV. I tried the strawberry filled French toast with bacon and scrambled eggs. I also tried a free banana nut muffin (it's free with Yelp check-in). The French toast was overbearingly sweet. The French toast on it's own without the strawberry madness was moist and fluffy; however, the strawberry filling along with the strawberry topping and the whip cream really overdid it. It was hard for me to finish.  The eggs and bacon were standard fare. Nothing to note. I tried some of my buddy's chicken fried steak. Again, decent seasoning, but tasted a bit too heavy for my liking.   What stood out for me was the banana nut muffin. It was moist and the muffin top was crispy. Even better that it was free. I liked how it didn't have too many walnuts in it. Nice balance between breading and nuts.  Service was fast and courteous. I would say if you're looking for a popular American breakfast spot, check out Egg & I.",

I didn't know what I wanted but then she suggested the strawberry cream cheese French toast and that was exactly what I wanted. My friend had bangin cinnamon raisin French toast. Also Karen hooked us up with the Yelp offer of a free banana nut muffin which was AMAZE.  Only con was they only had the type dye shirts in youth sizes- damn. Have to take that business to their website. Plus, prices are reasonable for Vegas.",

I had the Bloody Mary made with their signature mix which was fantastic! I ordered the chili relleno omelette which was one of the best omelettes I've ever had. I added  jalapenos to make it spicy and it was perfectly complimented by the salsa verde. My partner had the waffle topped with blueberries and whipped cream with eggs and turkey bacon. The waffle was perfectly cooked and lightly crispy. Overall the food was amazing. The service was great as well. We were running late for an event and our server Karla made sure everything came out quickly and brought our check immediately. I loved that she brought our banana nut muffins before our meal arrived since we were starving. Those muffins were SOOOOO good! I highly recommend this restaurant. It's a must do while in Vegas.",

Liza checked the kitchen for Soy free foods, and read the ingredients to double check. Really great service. Never an empty cup of coffee, food hot, all cooked great.  The Prime Rib Benny was a tad salty but I expected that from the Prime Rib. It's delicious. The Original Benny was great, too. My daughters Fruit Plate with yogurt was fresh and a much different variety than the usual fare at other places.   I think we'll add this to empty breakfast place slot that was opened Baby Stacks told us to freeze so the servers would be comfortable later in the day.  :/  Parking lot large enough, bathrooms clean, and tables stocked and condiments full. :D",

On the first day I got the ultimate skillet (no cheese) with Portuguese sausage instead of regular sausage (reminded me of Hawaii).  It had bacon, sausage, peppers, ranch potatoes and other deliciousness topped with 2 eggs over easy.   Super great! Also, the server gave me an ice tea to take with me.  The service was pretty good - it was packed but it seems the staff actually pays attention to the system of \"frowny egg\"/ \"happy egg\" because when we put the frowny egg on for more coffee, people came immediately.   The second day I got the prime rib benedict but with guacamole instead of hollandaise sauce.  That was awesome!  They were actually too generous with the guac and I had to leave some behind on my skillet.  Service was again pretty good, but we got the same waiter who remembered us.  Everyone else at the table was also very pleased with their meals.  Can't wait to return on future Vegas trips.",

It was served with Cincy chili which has cinnamon in it. I didn't really enjoy it as it gave the chili an odd taste. The chili was rather bland with no spiciness at all.

They offered to switch it out, but we were almost all finished with our meal so we asked if they could take it off the bill. There was some sort of miscommunication so when we got the bill, the skillet was still on there. In the end, after some time, they were able to take it off the bill and we left.

It came with seasoned homefries that were the best I'd ever had. Super crispy on the outside, nice and fluffy on the inside. The seasoning on these fries was perfection.   The banana nut muffin that came with the meal was PHENOMENAL!! Served warm with butter. You could literally taste the spices inside the muffin.  You could tell it was homemade.   If I lived in Vegas, I'd be a regular.",

Love the fact that they use an app system and you get a text of your wait time and your table is ready.  Service was GREAT!!   This time around my food was a bit on the salty side but still great!  As always, The banana nut muffin is a must have. OJ had a bit too much pulp as my straw had a tough time sucking it up. Plus it was not cold. Also I wish they served a single stack pancake that was not $5 but then again it was in the shape of a micky mouse and I'm pretty sure it was off the children's menu  Quick tip! Save $5 when you buy 2 entrees if you go get the VEGAS coupon book at miracle mile. I'm not sure if it's at the  other shops but it's free and will save you some $$$",

The home fried potatoes or just write with the right amount of seasoning. I had the corned beef scramble. It was very good.

He ate it all before I got a bite of it :P   We really enjoyed coming to this place! The wait wasn't bad. About 15-20 min for a party of 4 at like 10:30 am on a Sunday!

They had mist machines and fans outside to help combat the heat as well.  Our server Kelly was incredibly nice and friendly. I was having difficulty deciding between the Veggie Eggs Benedict (Works Veggie Benny) and the Fiesta Skillet. She recommended the skillet. It was so flavorful! The potatoes were cooked perfectly and the salsa tied everything together. The portions are HUGE. I was only able to eat like a third of my skillet so keep that in mind when you go.

The food on the other hand....  - hash browns were frozen fried patties - bagel was basic store bought - corned beef hash was riddled with peppers that overpowered any other flavors.  - sausage patties were comparable to McDonalds which is good if you like them, but just doesn't stand out in any memorable or good way.  - waffle was pretty good - the poached eggs were good - the banana nut muffin was probably the best thing I had. Tasted just like fresh banana bread.  Overall I have no interest in coming back for any of the food we tried.",

The restaurant seemed really busy because it took a while for a server to take our orders.   I ordered the bacon & sliced avocado omelette with a banana bread muffin and my boyfriend ordered the works omelette with a banana bread muffin. The banana bread muffin was still fresh and moist. It was so delicious. I highly recommend choosing the banana bread muffin over toast. We ordered seasoned potatoes with our omelettes. The portion sizes are really generous for the prices you pay ($10-12). In SF, you would have to pay at least $17 for the same portion size!  We really enjoyed our meals. We were so full after finishing everything. Our server was super friendly and made sure to check up on us to see how we were doing. The service was eggcellent. (Get it? Haha.) This is a really good and affordable brunch spot if you're not trying to break your wallet. There's also ample parking too! One suggestion would be to wear a long sleeve because the A/C was really high when we went last week.",

Our food was sweet, savory and hearty. The portions are large and filling. I also like that you can \"call ahead\" online with Waitlist. We would definitely come here again!!",

The food is always amazing, the service is typically exceptional except now. My guest and I sat for nearly 40 minutes, no one knew where our order was, no one asked to refill the original coffee cup, but what was worse, is when we brought it up - nicely- once, twice, thrice -  and eventually said we'd take it to go since we had a limited time- they absolutely ignored us. 5 minutes later we approached the cashier to pay for the single coffee cup and muffin we ever got --- and to our dismay the cashier was ready to charge us for sitting there while EVERYONE else was served. It was NOT a busy time, it was NOT a filled place. It was just we were insignificant. Now we'll find a new place. Blueberry Hill has been good!",

A testament to the efficient staff and their ability to keep things moving.  BUT:  Pancakes were doughy/floury and heavy.  Neither of my kids could eat more than 1/3-1/2 even with coaxing and bribery.  I ordered eggs Benedict but it was nothing special. Worst part is there was a distinct fake butter/margarine aftertaste (which is a pet peeve of mine).  it was a definite disappointment.  My husband had some sort of corned beef hash but his lack of commentary tells me it wasn't great.  Maybe we ordered the wrong menu items?    The free banana nut muffin for checking in on yelp was nice and the staff were friendly and efficient. Too bad the food didn't match.  We don't understand the hype...",

As great as the food was, it didn't hold a candle to Kat! She is very friendly, extremely helpful, and the most efficient waitress I've ever met!

I got stuffed french toast, which means eggs, meat, and cheese inside.  I ate past the point of being full, while still leaving a little on the plate, and my dad finished his pretty quickly because it was so good. He said as we were walking to the car, \"That's about as good of a breakfast as I've ever eaten.\" That's a top-level compliment that he doesn't use lightly.

They get your phone number and will text you when they are ready. Out door seating is along the street side under an overhang so it's covered in shade.   Inside has the diner feel to it. Service was super friendly. Got sat inside which was nice and cool. So many good items on the menu . There was a free banana nut muffin upon check in which was so good!

    "text": "I actually came here with my youngest son to use a Groupon that I'd gotten a pretty good deal on! We arrived at about 11 for a late breakfast and the place was packed. Which is typically a good sign, but it looked borderline at capacity. Moving on, we opted to sit on the patio and it was a great choice! They had misters that added a great touch and I enjoyed people watching! Only tip would be if you don't like pets don't come out here. It's a pet friendly area and in addition to a few dogs Mother Nature's pets attended... there was a fair amount of pigeons. Almost unsanitary because they'd get really close and flap off leaving all sorts of pigeon germs in the air. The restaurant can consider enclosing the area with that garden wood or something that would keep it a bit more sanitary.   Moving on to the food. I felt first off there's way too much going on with the menu. Pictures, eggs , burritos, omelettes, chili, pancakes, and everything is served a thousand ways! I was overwhelmed. Thankfully my baby just learned to read and knew he wanted waffles! I on the other hand ordered half a bacon and avocado omelette and a side of corned beef hash!   At best, the food was ok. The omelette was well cooked but the amount of avocado was overwhelming, a shock because usually you don't receive enough. The bacon was non existent because of the overwhelming avocado. The hash was mushy. I'd read it in another review and thought impossible, but the flavor was good, but the texture was similar to that of fried stringy mashed potatoes.  I will brag my baby's waffle was delicious, fluffy, and crispy! I'd come back for the waffles and the bacon!",

I was not able to finish the skillet, i wanted to save space for my muffin that saved for dessert. Will definitely recommend this place for anyone visiting Vegas.

    "text": "I took my family here after church this past Sunday. Lots of people waiting in the foyer, as you'd expect on a Sunday after church. They told us 20 minutes, then texted us a link to an online service that tracks your wait time. The app showed us who was ahead of us, how long they'd waited, and how many minutes we had left to wait. They beat the wait clock by about 5 minutes. I really liked having that real-time feedback.  The decor is woody, lots of rough wood paneling that is very warm and inviting. Tables are big enough. Lighting is just right, not too bright or dim.  Once seated in a very comfortable cozy booth - exactly what I was hoping for - we got our menus quickly and she came around quickly for our drinks. The selections are kind of vast, but the menu is well designed and logical, and we all got to a decision pretty quickly.  Given that wifey was driving I got the bloody Mary (very traditional for Sunday morning), and our waitress asked \"double?\" and not wanting to hurt her feelings I nodded 'yes'.  My Mexican Crepe was very good. Chorizo. Veggies. Lots of flavor. All my boys, and my wife all really liked what they ordered.   Our waitress kep a close eye on us without hovering. When we flipped the metal disk from Smiley face on black to Frowny face on yellow, she darted right over to answer our question \"what is this for?\" She said, \"it's basically the Bat Signal\" and like the Batman she was on it like a bonnet.  We never felt rushed. They communicated extremely well throughout the experience. Highly recommended. Probably gonna become a tradition for us.",

    "text": "Usually I pick to eat at a casino buffet, figure for the price it's a better value. On this trip, this morning, I didn't really want to deal with the parking and walking from the parking garage to the buffet 30 minutes later ordeal, just wanted to drive, park and eat. Decided to see what's good. Yelped to find this place. My Rose like the picture of an item so we came to eat here. Wound up getting seated outside which was perfect for pre-noon summer weather. Breakfast was satisfying. What made it better was to find a waitress that actually heard you. When being asked if I wanted starch choices, I told our's that I wanted the banana muffin but I'll probably need it to go since I ordered so much food for just two. When my plate came, I wondered where my muffin was, figured they probably forgot about it as it seems to be more customary nowadays or at least the area that I now reside in. I really wished I remembered our waitress's name but I'll describe her as the blond cutie; when I mentioned she forgot my muffin, she told she had it boxed to go and would bring it when we were done. Wow. I forgot how Las Vegas emphasizes customer service. What a breakfast experience. The day we were leaving, when I asked my girl where she wanted to eat before we left for that long drive back home, guess what she mentioned? By the way, their banana nut muffins are awesome. Wished I bought that loaf now. Super busy but I would wait, you will not regret it.",

Now that she has been homogenized and Oprah-sized and puts on make-up like Jack Nicholson as the Joker, I am somewhat sympathetic to her insatiable need to be the people's home cook, the pint-sized Paula Deen. Maybe that's why I was rather turned off by one of her Tasty Travels recommendations, the Egg & I on the corner of a strip mall out on Sahara Drive in Vegas.   Even though it doesn't have the A-frame roof, it's really an IHOP with a country kitchen vibe that seems to draw the who's who of the Convoy-and-trailer-park set. Rachael was giving her thumbs up to this place for all the egg dishes they offer. That I won't argue as the menu went on with variations of omelettes and skillet breakfasts that span the globe and stretch the pocketbook. Jamie W. was being very good and ordered the Original Breakfast Burrito (see photo). However, it was quite a log that came out with a flour tortilla stuffed with four eggs, diced bacon, bell peppers onions, potatoes, cheddar and jack cheese. It came on top of a plate of cubed ranch potatoes and some salsa.   It honestly tasted like any breakfast burrito, just more of it to justify the entree-level price. I went all self-indulgent and ordered the Blackened Prime Rib Benny, an Eggs Benedict variation which had little cubes of prime rib (whether it was blackened or even prime rib was quite arguable), sauteed spinach, roasted red bell peppers all chopped over what looked like a slice of Texas toast. Two poached eggs lay on top, and I asked for the hollandaise sauce on the side (see photo). Thank goodness since it was the congealed variety that clogs arteries faster than Drano cleans them out. It was on the meh side with nothing hofbrau-ish about the meat at all.  The dish came with the same cubed, packaged-looking potatoes Jamie got, and neither of us had any desire to finish them out. When you order coffee here, you actually get a little pot so they can charge $2.25 for it. Jamie had a glass of milk but it was $2 for just six ounces. Hell, I would have lactated myself for that price. Service was efficient, and even though they have a little egg sign you can flip over to get a waitress' attention, there was no need for it since they seemed interested in turning over tables lightning fast. I'm afraid I will need to second-guess Rachael Ray's judgments on what amounts to good eats on her travels, or else I may be doomed to high-calorie intakes of mediocrity.   FOOD - 2.5 stars....just thought the dishes were just too generic despite the abundance...it didn't seem human hands touched those ranch potatoes  AMBIANCE - 2.5 stars...country kitchen quaint if that's your idea of charming  SERVICE - 2.5 stars...efficient if rather impersonal, no need to flip that egg sign over on a busy morning  TOTAL - 2 stars....right on the border between 2 and 3 stars, but I need to go with my bulbous, post-benny gut on this one",

If i stayed back in vegas and longer i would eat my Breakfast only here.  They offered us the Banana Muffins after our meal. Thats really awesome. We couldn't eat them so they gave us ToGo.",

I only wished  i lived in Vegas to get the chance to have brunch here at least once/week.  the banana nut muffin was very fresh. The Chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes were perfectly fluffy and pumpkin was fresh, and teh chocolate chips were just right (not too much, not to few).  The Fried chicken skillet was also AMAZING!. Cooked just right, with a thick and creamy gravy, with perfectly cooked potatoes, and an egg, just how i asked for it. even the OJ carafe tasted fresh, and it probably wasn't though, but it had me fooled. Again the prices, service and quality of food were amazing. (only thing is that this particular Egg&I restaurant was a bit far from our Hotel on the strip, but definitely worth the cab ride). Even the General Manager came by our table  a few times to ask how everything was. (my receipt says the  server is Mandy but i believe her real name was thiereny (shes getting married soon)). And they have an amazing GIVEAWAY trip to Disney",

But hats off to Egg & I because we were able to be seated quickly ( when at other restaurants it would take about 40 mins to be seated)   Make sure that if you decide to come here that you use yelp and check in to get yourself a banana nut muffin.. The muffin was super light and moist and delicious.  There are so many different things to pick from on the menu.. The menu is super creative.. I got the breakfast burrito and it was the perfect size for my appetite.. The salsa for it was delicious too (I asked for extra).. I left full and ready for the day.  So I would definitely recommend  this place if you are hungry, because of the price, the amount of food, and the service. Is it mind blowing you ask? No, but it is definitely better then average. Hence the 4 star. I'm going to definitely come back.",

We chose which ever came first and were seated on the balcony and soon found  it was too cold and requested to be seated inside. Kaia our hostess checked with the greeter and was told  we would have to go back in line to be seated inside. Requested to speak to the general manager = Kady, who explained the restaurant policy( if you chose to be seated outside and then changed your mind you would have to go back in line) but was happy to seated us  inside and did so quickly. Karen our server  was very polite and explained  that we could have half orders any items so we could each enjoy two items. Service was excellent and food was great. We left  content and with complimentary banana bread. Thank you Kady.",

I loved the cafe/home ambience and it was cute to have an egg concept throughout the menu/place but the food was not all that great.  I had the eggs Benedict which did not taste fresh or traditional. The sauce was way too heavy for my liking.   My boyfriend got the meat omelette but it came with more potatoes than meat itself. The potatoes were dry so it was quite disappointing.  Service was great though. We had more than one server check on us and everyone appeared helpful.   I wanted to like the food here but it didn't work out.",

This is one of my favorite places in Vegas to have breakfast and they're typically open until about 3 pm, 7 days a week. You have to try their potatoes and banana nut muffins, they so good and addictive! I usually go for the omelets when I come here, and no matter which one you order, they're all delicious. If you have ever been to Egg Works, this place is owned by the same people, but is just a little smaller in size and menu.",

The service was attentive and polite. We ordered the works skillet which is potatoes mixed with green bell peppers, onions, ham, sausage over 2 eggs cooked any way you like. We also got half an order of carrot cake French toast- which we thought was too sweet. The banana nut muffin was terrific- very moist, fresh out of the oven, and not too sweet. Yelpers can check in for a free banana nut muffin if it doesn't already come with your meal. Overall a good place for brunch/ breakfast.",

So I tried the Spinach Benny with Canadian bacon (ham) and a side of Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. My husband had The Classic with 2 basted eggs, seasoned potatoes and toast....,they both were good but not egg-ceptional as advertised They have these eggs that you turn over on the tables if you need service (see photo) which is a cool idea but our server was swamped and really was so far away with other tables that she couldn't take care of us well. We went to the oldest location and although it was busy, it really could use an update and maybe even a day to shut down and be cleaned from top to bottom. TIP FOR YELPERS! Check-in online for a free banana nut muffin. They are HUGE and delish!",

If you want to depart from the chain restaurant and have more of a country restaurant atmosphere this is a nice spot. Sometimes I like to just sit and journal for a bit and they were ok with people \"camping out\" in the restaurant.   Be mindful of the hours when you come. I believe they do their last seating at 3pm so give yourself enough time to relax and enjoy.   I would definitely come back. Can you find better food elsewhere? Yes.

I ordered the Chicken Skillet, my husband ordered the chocolate chip pancakes.  Both items were reallyyyy good however the chocolate chip pancakes were total overload, the pancakes were drenched in chocoalte chips and i love chocolate but it was a little too much actually not a little just TOO MUCH for my liking even my teeth starting to hurt because of the sweetness. The prices were really reasonable and food was good and the service was awesome especially for how busy it was all.    You must visit this place! yummmmy!",

Another smile maker is the super friendly service. Host station, servers and waiter all seem to enjoy their work and sharing pleasantries with their guests.   Hubs decided on the Three Pigs omelette and I had the chili loco moco. All was yummy. We cashed in our Yelp! check-in bonus for a free banana muffin that was pretty good. I wish we went with a large group so we could have sampled the bacon-maple cream cheese stuffed French toast, waffles and the blueberry cakes.   My rating would actually rest between 4 and 5 stars. It was their friendliness toward dogs that catapulted them to the top. Loved that they are clear on pet expectations so visitors can bring their furry family members, too.   Tip: Don't be put off by the long line. It moves quickly and you can always browse at the neighboring shops and bakery.",

    "text": "Items selected:  Coffee Cinnamon Roll Banana Nut Muffin Chocolate Chip Pumpkin Pancakes Carrot Cake French Toast with Sassy Apples  With a house full of boxes waiting to be unpacked and a long run already in the morning's rearview it was with carbohydrates on my mind that we descended on venerable The Egg & I just after 6:30am and finding only a few regulars inhabiting the space as a half dozen holiday-clad servers stood in waiting I can only assume that both food and services rendered were as good as the restaurant gets...and both were pretty darn good.  A whimsical concept with a plethora of breakfast staples \"eggceptionally\" categorized plus a number of seasonal specials it was without hesitation that eyes turned to things autumnal and with a full pot of coffee in hand each dish that followed was exactly as expected - fresh, comfortable, and delicious; the sort of thing you 'could' make at home but never do...though if you make banana bread this light and moist or carrot cake pudding moldable to crispy French Toast I'll gladly come over, bring the coffee, and do dishes.",

Great atmosphere to enjoy that food  This well run food joint has it all covered and makes me keep going back and others as well. There is always a wait to be seated but not a long one.   Enjoy!",

I ordered the spinach Benny. Eggs Benedict with potatoes on the side. I'm picky with my poached eggs and they made it perfect. Not too wet or to cooked like some other places I've been to. My BF ordered original house burrito and he said that was good. I tried it and it was good too. Lastly we ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I've never had choc chip pan cakes before but for having it the first time. I loved it.   Prices were good not too expensive. Would definitely come here again.",

The service is always really good and the food is very good too!   The only dish I've had issues with is the corned beef hash. It comes out way too mushy and too salty! I've ordered it twice and have been disappointed both times. :( hubby is obsessed with the country Benny. That's a biscuit with a sausage patty, poached eggs, and country gravy. He tries to get the same thing at other restaurants, but it's never the same :)  The seasoning on the potatoes is great~ We bought a bottle to have at home although we have yet to use it haha  Anyway, 4 stars for the general deliciousness and service!",

Yes there were people waiting outside to eat due to this place being so popular for breakfast.  The wait was 15 minutes which wasn't that bad.  I tried the waffle works, which consisted of a huge Belgian waffle with 2 pieces of bacon and 2 eggs.  I did request whipped cream on the waffle, which made it taste even better.  The waffle was huge.  I enjoyed every bite.  The portions were very generous for the price.  Worth every penny.  The server Lindsey was wonderful and made sure I had the meal of a lifetime.         The Egg and I taught me a lesson that the best places to eat are not always on the Strip or Downtown Las Vegas.  There are good places to eat all over Las Vegas and you have to dig deep into your soul for the best food possible.  The Egg and I has a small town feel to it which provides an intimate dining experience.  This is one of the few places in Las Vegas you can eat at everyday and not get tired of it but wouldn't do so simply due to the fact that you don't want to spoil yourself.  This will become my new go-to spot in need of a good breakfast while visiting.  As far as the food quality and atmosphere goes. the Egg and I destroys Denny's and IHOP by all leaps and bounds imaginable.",

Granted, I've only been here once, but I can't stop thinking about the delicious food I ate and how I wish we had this place in LA.   I ordered the Chili Relleno omelet and the Country Benny. They had the option of ordering smaller portions of the skillets and omelet dishes which I really enjoyed because the portions were fairly large and I unfortunately can never finish my food, no matter how hard I try.  The Chili Relleno was so extremely flavorful, the omelet practically melted in my mouth. And the Country Benny, the gravy, the sausage, the biscuit... Mmmm! My eyes rolled back with every bite. I wanted to order the banana pancakes but I think I was getting ahead of myself.   Our waitress, Carla, was amazing.

We had the chile relleno omelette and the kitchen sink omelette, one with a banana muffin and one with sourdough toast. We ordered a side order of the bacon maple cream cheese for the muffin, it was so good! The omelettes were cooked perfectly, the potatoes on the side are delicious. Highly recommend making the drive to come here!",

It was Tuesday morning and the place was crowded up to the last available seat. We ordered the Sunrise Mountain and the Eggs Benedict and they did not disappoint at all!   Oh, did I mention they offer free banana nut muffins if you check in through Yelp? Do not underestimate the muffin: they are the most delicious, truly homemade muffins I have ever had in my life. I am not having muffins anywhere else anymore but the ones from this place. Darn, I need to go back to Vegas JUST to have breakfast again in \"The Egg & I\"... :)",

Their habla diablo potatoes are  pretty good. Crispy on the outside,  soft on the inside and dry seasoned with a reddish spice mixture that is slightly spicy.   New York steak and eggs - this is an egg based restaurant that served cold, browned (aka overcooked)  scrambled eggs?! The steak was thin, cold,  and lacking any flavor. Their signature habla diablo potatoes were probably the only really good part of the dish.   (I know that there is no built in firewall against poorly cooked eggs at an egg based restaurant but c'mon)   Mimosas: You're given a small, unopened bottle of champagne turned upside down in a glass Mason jar. A cup of pulpy orange juice is served on the on the side.  I like that you can control the ratio of champagne to orange juice.   The atmosphere: Farmhouse chic. Packed with patrons. There is an open air patio in the back (pets allowed). Booths in the middle, tables along the walls.   The entryway deserves a paragraph to itself.  One. Big. Clusterf**k. People are waiting to be seated and are either sitting along the walls or standing (most likely in the way of someone). People are lining up to be placed on the seating wait list. People are sitting or standing along the wall just inside the dining room and outside of the front door. People are ordering food to-go. People are lining up or grouping together like a human barricade, waiting to pay their bill. Honestly, even the hostess could not tell me where the line ended to pay the bill. After being one of the few courteous people constantly moving out of others' way, a new line has formed and of course they want to act like you cut them in line.",

Then the tomato slices were grilled and with fresh avocado. Once again I subbed the fruit for the potatoes. So impressed with the array of sliced fruit. My family loved the huevos rancheros as well as the huge chocolate chip pancakes. I must mention that our server Linnea was delightful and sweet. So attentive and friendly.

How do they know when you're not happy?  Well, you turn the egg over to the unhappy face!!! haha.  great customer service!

This place is also the same as Egg Works and I have eaten at both spots and they are both excelent.   There menu is awesome with all the regular stuff plus with crepes, omelets, scrabbles, skillets, bennys, and hawaiian breakfasts.  They also have a cincy chili section that I like, I have never had cincy chili for real but I know what it's all about (over spaghetti) and this chili is real good.  You can also get toast or a banana nut muffin with your meal.     They do everything well and I have never been disappointed with anything but my favorites are the cincy chili omelet, enchilada omelet, and anything with their excellent country gravy all over it.  They have a chicken fries steak skillet that is potatoes topped with chopped up fried steak, topped with gravy, topped with eggs however u want, it is AWESOME.  They also won some awards for their cincy chili burger but I have never had it.     My good friend and fellow yelper used to think cracked egg was the best place in town and refused to eat here for some stupid reason.  Well we ate here and he was mad at himself for missing out on this place for all these years, don't make the same mistake.",

    "text": "Awesome place!!  We were undecided between the Egg & I and another place we saw on Yelp with great reviews.  We'd gotten rid of our rental car the day before so we'd have to take a taxi to either.  At the spur of the moment, we picked the Egg & I.  Yay for us for picking an awesome joint.  We waited only about 10-15 minutes before being seated.  Once seated, we flipped through the newspaper menu.  I'd read so much about the muffins, we ordered a couple to start our meal.  They were banana nut muffins.  We both ate the entire thing.  So good.  And with a great cup of coffee, we could've stopped right there.  But we didn't!  Since breakfast is not my favorite meal, I love it when I find a place that has lunch style breakfast.  There were so many options I had to choose from.  I was stuck between the stuffed pepper and the Tacos Rancheros.  I chose the Tacos Rancheros.  It was a tortilla topped with refried beans, ground hamburger, two eggs (which I got fried) and topped with cheese and sour cream.  I would've liked some salsa with it but it didn't need it.  My partner got the garlic mashed potato omelet.  It was enormous.  She could only eat half of it to which our server, Karla suggested getting the half order next time!  Shoot, we didn't know you could do a half order.  But, my partner said she wouldn't gotten a half anyway because the portions would be all wrong.  We both loved the Old Bay seasoned fried potatoes.  As we waddled out, it was great that the front desk called a cab for us.  Very nice.  Oh, and there's a little egg face on the table that you can flip revealing a sad egg face if you happen to need anything.  That's a brilliant idea!  Karla was awesome and if we lived in the area, it would be our go to place!",

Comes in an open bun with a large pickle, lettuce, and tomatoes.   I was very satifised with it.    Usually the service is pretty good and friendly except when they're super busy.  Then it gets a little quick and snappy.  But overall, I definitely look forward to coming here whenever I go to Vegas.

The second we walked in we were greeted by the hostess & given a table right away (it was really early so it wasn't that crowded yet) and a couple of mins later our server Amanda greeted us & took our drink order. The menu had a HUGE selection of items and after minutes deciding my husband ordered the ciabatta breakfast sandwich & I ordered the French toast breakfast sandwich     (both sandwich came with a side of potatoes) and we were pleased with our selections. Not only were the portions big but they were delicious! Their potatoes are super good too, my husband isn't a potato guy he prefers hashbrowns BUT he really liked those potatoes. A good restaurant with good food is nothing if they don't have good service & our server Amanda was great! She was very attentive, she made us feel like locals which we loved because when traveling we don't like to be treated like tourists. Over all, I give this place 5 stars because of their delicious food & great costumer service! When visiting Las Vegas, this is must try spot!!!",

All the staff were friendly, they work hard and don't take short-cuts. Whole wash took maybe an hour with no idle time. Great results, no missed spots, will come again. I wish Irvine had a place like this.",

    "text": "So, after a crazy weekend in Vegas whats the first thing your body needs before you hit the traffic on I -15?  An IV, close... Breakfast.  The Egg & I is not to far off the strip, only about a mile depending on where you stay.  We took the back roads from Caesars and our ETA was about 5 minutes.   The coolest thing is their \"happy egg, sad egg\" stand at the edge of the table.  Whenever you need something like a drink refill, or if you have a problem with anything, just flip the egg from the happy black face to the sad yellow face.  We tested this unique method of customer service and within seconds we had our waitress back at the table asking if we needed anything.  Even without flipping the egg the waitress was very attentive.  After you get your drinks the waitress will bring you a fresh baked banana nut muffin.  My buddy thought he was flirting with the waitress, and they totally were, so he made us all thank him graciously for the 2 muffins.  Then after 30 seconds of looking around, you realize everyone gets a muffin.  *Sad egg face Jordan, sorry :^(   But the muffin is warm and delicious.    We had a party of 4 and we all got something different and it was all great.  I got chicken fried steak covered in gravy atop a mound of ranch potatoes with 3 fried eggs on top, and the best part about it was... they CUT it up for you!  This is when I found out I am lazy because you know you're lazy when you get excited about your food coming pre-cut.  The chicken breast was moist and the outside was perfectly crisp, and with every bite the batter unleashed a flurry of flavor.  Mouth watering.  The hype about their ranch potatoes is True.  They are really good and live up to the expectations other yelpers have set fourth.  I haven't had anything quite like them ever before.  My plate also came with a side of fresh seasonal fruit and a biscuit for gravy dunking.   The rest of the gang ordered: eggs benedict, the breakfast burrito, and a plain jane 2-egg breakfast with bacon.  All of which was worth the wait on a Sunday morning.  5-Stars for the overall experience.  The waitress was cute and friendly even if she didn't give Jordan a muffin because he was \"special,\" their happy egg / sad egg system works well when you need something in a pinch, the superior quality of the food and the prices are great especially after losing a couple G's at the tables in Vegas.",

They serve large portions so if you don't want alot ask for a half order if it's available!! Make sure you check in on yelp for your banana muffin!! P.s. It's rare when I find a place I will write a review about. So check them out when your in Las Vegas!!",

I had an Egg Works Country Fried Steak.  My breakfast meal was good; country steak was delicious, gravy was good, and the eggs (over medium) were cooked spot on.

Reminds me of how Brazilian restaurants have those red and green things to let them know when to come to your table or not.  P.S. Make sure to check-in and get a FREE banana muffin! It's so moist and is a great way to end a meal here.",

We thought both of them were delicious, and there was plenty to eat.  So much that about half of our order came home in a box.  It was open seating and a bit noisy so don't expect much privacy, although that wasn't a big issue with us.  The staff was courteous, and prompt with the extras we asked for.  The cashier was, to use and old phrase, \"bubbly\" while checking out a line of people, a trait that we found refreshing for such a busy place.  We were very satisfied and agree that they lived up to the positive reviews that we used to chose them.",

The one place that is MUST for us to go to for an amazing breakfast is the Egg & I restaurant.   This last visit was no exception to any of the past visits. The food was so fantastic. The options were endless. Who knew you could prepare eggs so many delicious and wonderful ways?  Lindsay our waitress was very friendly and helpful. We brought our youngest son on this trip (for his 21st birthday) and he was having a hard time making a selection. Lindsay took the time to answer all of his questions and gave him a great recommendation of the country fried skillet. He LOVED IT!!! Thank you LIndsay!  All I can say is - if there is a line or a wait (and there most likely will be) then take the time because it is worth it. The coffee is fresh and hot and the banana nut muffins are a MUST (unless you are allergic of course).  We only waited about 15 minutes and our food was on the table - pipping hot. I ordered my favorite - the Greek scramble. FOUR eggs, chicken, spinach, mushrooms,and feta cheese make up this belly busting breakfast. It is served with choice of toast or muffin (I got the muffin) and breakfast potatoes.   My hubby ordered the Chili omllete and he had a choice of chili's. His came with the same sides only he ordered toast instead of a muffin. I have no idea why because that muffin is served warm with butter. YUM!!!  Cost is a little higher than say a Perkins or iHop - but the food is SO much better! Expect to pay about $ 15 per person including a beverage. Serving size is SO BIG that you could almost split something and share.",

The OJ was a little pricey ($3.25) but other than that, the prices were decent. The only reason I'm knocking off a star, is because we asked for a cup of ice to-go, (we're from CA, and planned on driving home after our meal. Wanted the ice for water on the road) and when the ice melted there was some sort of dirt in the bottom of the cup. I'm not sure if she gave us a dirty cup or if they have dirty ice.

Locals as well as visitors and tourists keep this place packed.  They do everything great here.  From chicken and waffles to omelettes, benedicts, and pancakes.  Last time I was here I even saw a guy commenting to his waitress how great their taco salad was.  I love a place that is always good everytime I go, consistent with service and food quality.  I think they even sell their own hot sauces now.    This is a spot I try to hit every time I'm in Vegas.",

Surprisingly I thought the food and the service here at Egg & I were much more acceptable then Egg works. Boy was it busy though, I hate waiting outside...it's too damn hot in Vegas. Besides sitting in the heat waiting to be seated, I enjoyed the rest of my experience here. The staff was very friendly and helpful and the food was good (not amazing).",

    "text": "Kind of disappointing. We've been here several times over the years and generally been happy. But things have gone down hill and our group of five were all disappointed.   First they were out of several things that a breakfast place which has been in business for years should not run out of. Like bread for French toast, one of their more popular items should always be in stock.   But what really surprised us is how cheap they've gotten and lazy with inferior ingredients. Hash-browns were those frozen oval patties you buy at Sams or Costco in bulk. Tasteless and cheap. How hard is it for a breakfast joint to make real hash browns? My son ordered country potatoes and they too were from frozen and preseasons. They same kind you can buy at any grocery store.   I asked for a blueberry muffin but was told those were also store bought. The waitress suggested the banana muffin which they do make which was very good.   My wife ordered maple bacon French toast which seemed to be made of a muffin batter. That doesn't really work for French toast as it's heavy and doesn't get crisp or toasted at all. The whipped maple bacon stuff tasted of old rancid grease, it was lumpy and everyone of us who tasted it said it seemed like diary gone bad like lumpy old milk! Three of us were sick to our stomachs all morning.   Hey but at least service was slow and it was extremely noisy to the point that I had to go outside to escape the noise.   I doubt we'll ever be back. Our waitress was attentive though.",

I asked for half decaf and half regular coffee, and she brought me my own carafe, already half-caf. We told her that we like lots of cream and twice she brought us lots of creamers. As it was our first visit, we got a free banana nut muffin. Mmm! I just wish I had known how big the portions were. We could easily have shared. I was sad to waste half of my meal.  My only suggestion would be to use real heavy cream for the coffee instead of creamer.",

Not to mention the fresh baked banana bread for my kids. The wait staff was so friendly and great with our kids, they made quite a mess but the staff was quick to clean and reassure us.

We enjoyed EVERYTHING!! She had the Sundance Special Omelette and I had the Egg-taliano!! Seriously.... we are from Philly and so glad we came.

    "text": "On our way out of Vegas back to Oceanside, I was searching for a place for my husband and I to have breakfast, and found Egg & I on Yelp. With all the stellar reviews, it wasn't a hard sell! Located in a strip mall, it's unassuming from the outside but super cute on the inside! The ceiling is a vibrant green, and there is a farm/county-esque mural on on the wall, with other fun rustic touches.   We were seated and greeted by Cece, who brought coffee and took our orders, letting us know that if we needed anything at all, to just flip the little egg over at the end of the table, and someone from their staff would come right over. I accidentally tested it by reaching over to check it out, and as soon as I did, a gentleman rushed right over asking whether I needed anything. Now that's attentive service!!  Just a warning - if you are a fairly healthy eater or are sensitive to too much fat, oil, etc., come prepared to modify your order to omit certain things or ask for a smaller portion (which is a great option!). The skillet breakfasts we both ordered arrived (they were pretty huge) absolutely encased in cheese. I pulled about a 1/2 pound of melted cheese off my skillet before I even began eating, and I'm glad I did, because my husband didn't and had a stomachache later. They also cooked their eggs perfectly - my request for over-medium came as-ordered with no runny white (which I hate), and my husband's over-hard eggs were good too.   Settle your check up at the register at the end of your meal like the old days. Great little place! I would come here again.",

Came here with a group of 4 on a Saturday morning around 10 AM and it was jam packed! Our wait was only 10 minutes though so no complaints here. The staff were all so friendly, helpful, and welcoming.   When you check in on Yelp, you get a free Banana Nut Muffin! WINNING!  Our server, Penny, was so happy we were using Yelp and said she'd even bring us 2 muffins for free! That was super nice of her. The Banana Nut Muffin here is amazing! Homemade, fresh, moist, and comes out perfectly warm. I'm not even a fan of Banana Nut Muffins, but damn, they don't play here!!!  I ended up ordering the Prime Rib Eggs Benedict and my wife got the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet. My in-laws shared the Prime Rib Eggs Benedict. The portions here are huge! Our food came out super hot/fresh and in a timely manner. My eggs were perfectly poached and their house Hollandaise sauce was the bomb! Perfect creaminess and flavor. The chunks of prime rib were tender and well seasoned. I love how they used a crispy croissant as the base of the benny instead of an English muffin. Very different and unique! I had a bite of my wife's skillet and thought it was OK. If you come here, you have to eat the Prime Rib Benny and their Banana Nut Muffin. I'd come back here just for those two items alone!",

I don't know what they put in their food but I always come back for more. Their omelettes are beautiful, thick, and not to mention VERY tasty. This past visit, I had the Fiesta skillet. I can't say it was better than the veggie omelette though. I personally like my potatoes very crispy and I didn't think of the fact that the potatoes that come in the skillet are in a sauce so they inevitably lost some of their crispness. Now I know to just order the sauce on the side because nothing beats the flavor in each of their meals.  The atmosphere resembles that of a True American diner. The service is great. I've never had to wait for a seat and I have gone on weekends every time. Eat here!",

I usually go on weekdays with family at around 10 am, and there's normally no wait during then. Service is fast, and the staff is super friendly and polite! They give you large portions for what you pay, and, in my opinion, there are no bad items on the menu. My favorite items to get though are any of their Eggs Benedict.   Definitely come here if you're looking for a cheaper brunch option while vacationing in Vegas. Their food honestly beats any other breakfast you'll find on the strip for the prices they offer!",

Environment is like any other breakfast place .. a little loud, a little small/cramped with space but it wasn't bad. They have a waiting area so you're not just standing by the door waiting. I yelped this restaurant & chose it based on how many stars & reviews they had.",

I was super full once I was done eating most of my meal.  The food had plenty of flavor. It was definitely worth going away from the strip to try this place out. The menu looks like a newspaper. Very creative!  They take all major credit card but Amex. Checkout was easy. Once you get your receipt/check from your server, walk to the cashier to pay. Sorta like a Bob Evan's or Perkins.  I would visit this place again. Happy belly! The service is great. Our server was on point. We were given a warm banana Nut bread muffin to begin... yum!",

    "text": "FYI: While this offer lasts, check-in for a free Banana Nut Muffin, you will not regret it!   What a gem to have in Las Vegas, definitely one of the best breakfast spots I've ever had. After looking up a few places, ie. Denny's, Hash House a Go Go, we decided to come here even though it's off the strip. We took a Lyft from Venetian and the ride was only $11.   With a party of 10, we thought that the wait would be around an hour, hour and a half, but amazingly, it was only thirty minutes. If you are coming here though, expect a long wait, so be patient, but it's worth the wait! Once we got seated, they handed us menus which looks like a daily newspaper. Deciding what to eat here was probably one of the hardest decisions I've had to make since there are 8 pages of food to read. Took a while but I finally decided on the Santa Cruz Skillet.   Santa Cruz Skillet: The order came with toast and butter (since I got the muffin with the check-in) and sunny-side up eggs. The potatoes, chorizo, Santa Cruz sauce and the runny yolk was probably the best breakfast you could ask for after a night of drinking. Portion-wise, you could easily share this with another person but I was able to finish it on my own.   Service was amazing throughout the meal, they have a system where you flip the happy egg to a sad egg whenever you need something, genius! I would have subtracted a star for them bringing out the 2 Bloody Mary's and Michelada after we almost finished the food, but they didn't charge us for the drinks in the end. On top of that, 7 of us checked-in for the free Banana Nut Muffin. I can't stress this enough, don't forget to check in! Will be back here for sure to try the other items on the menu.   Beware: You will get a food coma after eating here, we all ended up taking a nap in the room afterwards, but once again, soo worth it!",

We can tell why it is a local favorite as it the staff offers a warm welcome.  Their famous banana muffin arrived almost immediately after we put in the order.  It was so light, fuffy, yet sticky, we could have easily eaten a full loaf just the two of us.  We didnt realize you can order the full lf until a plate was served near us...   Their menu (made to look like the morning paper - clever concept!) offered an abundant options that it could be overwhelming.  They dropped our veggie eggs benedict, so they had to fire it again... the spinach was left raw and piled in top of the itty bitty english muffin and slivers of avocados.  We love spinach, but the proportions were off - would have liked a slightly sauteed spinach or place a smaller portion of raw leaves.  Our other orders were a classic over easy eggs with spicy seasoned potatoes with an xtra side of waffles.  Since they had to re-fire the eggs benedict, the egg was luke warm and waffles were not as golden crispy as we liked.  Whoever made our batch of coffee added too much water as it was missing that needed caffeine perk.  Im sensitive to caffeine and even I thought it was too weak.    We love the vibe of this breakfast spot, so hopefully, it will be a win next time.",

The wait time was 40 minutes but we did go on a Sunday around 11 AM. The staff is very friendly and our server didn't come around as often as I would have liked but when she did come around she was attentive and make sure we had everything. This is definitely a place that I will visit again when I do come back to Vegas. It is off of the strip which is another good thing. The Lyft ride over was a shared ride & we only been paid $3.00 for both of us. Highly recommend trying this spot.",

We decided to pay a visit to this happening place on weekend at around 11 a.m., and it was packed! The wait was tediously long, but it was so worth it; as they really live up to the hype by offering an extensive menu of breakfast goods at an affordable prices.   For breakfast, it's egg benedict all the way for me! Ordered their Blackened Prime Rib Benny:  buttery slabs of croissants underneath tender, juicy prime ribs, topped with sauteed vegetables and hollandaise sauce. Nothing on this plate disappoints me! Nothing! All of them were superb, I personally love their habla diablo potatoes, it was crunchy and seasoned perfectly. The price for my breakfast is about $14; which is more than reasonable, especially if you witness the portion...  And if huge pan of egg benedict and half a plate of yummy potato goodness is not enough... wait for it.. They give you even more. As an offer for Yelp check-in, they generously gave us four of their famous banana muffins.  IT IS TO DIE FOR!!  Overall, if simple ambiance and BIG (tasty) breakfast experience is your cup of tea, Egg & I definitely will not disappoint. What a delicious find and happy to recommend this spot to you :)",

With that been said I've have the best customer service from this place even when is a mad house. The patio has a great view and also is pet friendly . They also give you this little egg on top of your table to tell the waiter how the service is. A black egg says everything is fine and a yellow egg is you need service.

The scramblers are amazing along with their warm banana nut muffin... so good! Service was always great when I go. Never had a problem. Staff super friendly. The only thing is on the weekend you will probably have to wait 30+ minutes to be seated.  Thanks to the Food Network I found this gem!",

I do not remember the name of our server, but she was fantastic.  She was energetic, thoughtful and the type of server you hope to have during every dining experience.  The coffee and drinks flowed and she really knew the menu.  Top notch employee.  I ordered the mashed potato omelet, the hubs had the three pig omelet and the littles had the Mickey pancake with bacon.  We opted for the hashbrowns over the specialty potatoes and they were sad.  It was similar to two oval shaped McDonald's hashbrowns, which would have been fine, but they were over done and not too appealing.  The omelets were good and plentiful, but nothing out of the ordinary.  Unfortunately, the food did not live up to the hype.  It wasn't bad, but it wasn't so good that I would go out of my way to visit when we're in Vegas.  They have an expansive menu that would satisfy any palette, I'm just not sure it's going to get us back.  To our sweet server (she was pregnant), you're a rockstar!",

They usually seat people fast, but because it is SO good, you should definitely expect to wait.   I'm so glad I took a group of 10 of my girlfriends here at the end of our Vegas trip. The portions were humungous and I had to challenge myself to finish my plate. Yes, the banana nut muffins do live up to its hype!! So delicious and so fresh. Most plates actually come with the banana nut muffin as an option, but they'll give you another one if you check in!  Their menu is EXTENSIVE. So if you are an indecisive person like I am, it'd probably help kill your wait time if you take a look at that menu to decide what you want! They offer breakfast sandwiches, french toast, egg bennys, OMELETTES, specialties, and more. I went for the chile relleno omelette and I'm SO glad I did! It wasn't too saucy and the sauce they offer is super good. Their POTATOES. SO GOOD. Thank god they let me get half potatoes half fruit, because the full portion of potatoes is HUGE!   My girlfriends and I all ordered different items on everyone enjoyed their meal :) I would say you probably can't go wrong with anything on the menu! Definitely coming again to end a Vegas trip.   Service is great. The interior decor is super cute. Very family friendly!  I spent $15 including tip for a HUGE breakfast so, yes, I'd say this is a very good breakfast deal located off the strip!",

Also, HIGH FIVE for treating my baby so lovingly. They gave her a bowl (paper) of fresh water & gave us another bowl for our leftovers. I'm always ecstatic when I'm allowed to bring my baby.

We love feta cheese and it comes loaded with it. The chicken fried steak comes with your choice of two eggs, toast, and potatoes. The steak is smothered in a flavorful white gravy. The portions are large so you can always take some food home for later  The service is great also. Our order came fast and easy. Don't forget to check in on Yelp to get your free banana nut muffin. They're very moist and delicious. It hits the spot when you're starving for a hearty breakfast.",

Thank goodness the wait wasn't too long because by now we've been on the road for 5+ hours and we're starving!!!   I have a feeling that this place is super busy all the time--the restaurant is packed with people and the service is also super duper speedy, like the servers here are always on their toes to get people in and out as quickly as possible. But they're still super friendly, so I'm not complaining because I love the efficiency of this place.   F O O D: Honestly the food here was a pretty big disappointment. For some reason the food here was very very salty--the ham, the sauce, everything. Eating this makes me feel super gross and pretty terrible about myself. Especially because the portion sizes here are HUGE! My friend and I shared the Stuffed French Toast and we couldn't finish it (sorry potatoes :( ). So I recommend sharing just one thing between you and a friend or you can always take it to-go. I thought the Stuffed French Toast was really delicious because it wasn't salty at all, but our friends that got the Eggs Benedict dishes weren't so lucky :(   P A R K I N G: There is a parking lot right out front so no worries about parking!

The works skillet comes with works potatoes, bacon, sausage and ham, then topped with eggs (any style) and gooey cheese! So good and very very filling. The mashed potato omelette also comes with the works potatoes on the side. Seriously, the omelette is huge (4 eggs!)! It's filled with bacon and garlic mashed potatoes then topped with cheese and sour cream. The waffles are just okay, plain but tasty. We definitely enjoyed our meal!  Service was fast and excellent considering they were so busy that day. Our waiter is a pleasant guy and he's very efficient.   Our order came up to 35 bucks.

    "text": "Went here on a Saturday morning. They take reservations on the phone but will only hold the table for you for 10 mins - so I suggest calling as you are on your way.  We had a big group (8 BABES)   Once we got there it was only a 15 min wait even if there was a ton of people waiting. Not sure if it was because we called in advanced.  This place is quite large on the inside with ample seating. A family environment.  They have this thing on the table similar to what I saw at Bubba Gumps where you can turn the sign to make it so that if a waiter sees it, they will help you. See pics!  If you check in VIA Yelp - you get a free Banana Walnut Muffin - but I got one anyways with my meal. I ordered the Sundance Special which was a veggie omelet with spinach, mushroom & artichoke hearts topped with tomatoes and feta cheese (which would lead to my later food poisoning - not through the fault of the restaurant but mine) It was super yummy but it was a huge serving so I had to take it home. FYI; leaving feta cheese in a car for 5 hours is never a good idea.  You pay up front. FYI.  I would recommend it as there are a ton of good choices for food and they all look good. There are a ton of choices for vegetarians as well. Always a PLUS!",

The service was quick and respectful and the food was a savory spectacle.   We were a group of six arriving at peak brunch hour and we were seated in less than 5 minutes. Our dining experience began when we checked in on Yelp to get a free batch of their acclaimed banana nut muffins. Our server served them to us warm and they were perfect to peak our appetites for what was to be a massive, hearty breakfast. I ordered my own creation of the The Works skillet with country gravy on top while the rest of my group tried different variations of the Eggs Benny. The country gravy was the best I've ever had and the fresh ingredients in the rest of the skillet balanced the whole meal out. I was impressed with my friend's Eggs Bennies as well. You really can't beat their brunch especially at their modest prices.   This place is definitely gonna be a staple of my future Vegas trips",

I got the homemade orange juice again. It was really delicious but I couldn't eat it all. Afterwards, my waiter said they can do half portions! :)   My other members got burritos and stuffed French toast. They were gobbled up and said they were good.

I opted for the banana muffin and was so glad I did. They make it in house and was warm and delicious. My main dish was really greasy and hit the spot good! They were generous with the sausage portions.

Check out their skillet menu which I think is better than a regular breakfast dish. Their banana muffin is the best cuz it's fresh, warm, soft and moist. On top of that, they're very pet friendly. I bring my corgi to the restaurant and sit in the patio outside all the time. The staff is friendly and even offer me water for my dog. Definitely I will recommend this place to others.",

We placed an order for pick up because I had a feeling it was going to be packed, and I guess I'm psychic. That also means I won't be commenting on service as much as it wouldn't be fair.   The bomb: I ordered the mashed potato omelette. Seems to be a favorite. Easy to see why. The omelette itself was very tasty and flavorful. The potatoes were also delicious af. It also came with sour cream that made it even more delicious af.  It deserves its own line. The banana nut muffin. It's amazing. Ditch the toast. Be brave and go for the muffin.  My mom had the veggie crepe. It was also amazing. I have a big thing for avocados and there was plenty of avocado up in here. Highly recommended.  The chocolate chip pancake was great as well. Not too sweet, not too bland. Just right.   The bad: If you're planning to eat inside, be prepared to wait. But honestly. That's it.   Will definitely come back when I'm craving some eggs. I love eggs. If you're willing to drive a little from your hotel, it's definitely worth it.",

Sausage was a little bland but nothing some hot sauce can't fix. Potatoes on the side were awesome. There's some seasoning they put on it that really makes it work. The muffin was pretty good, not the best I've ever had but pretty darn good for a free muffin (if you check in on yelp to unlock deal). Service was friendly and attentive. You have to walk the check up to the register to pay...thought that was a bit weird but whatever...its a minor inconvenience. Overall I'd say worth a visit if you're close by.",

Wife said that they put a little too much hollandaise sauce on the benedict, so if you don't like them drenched, ask for lighter sauce. My Loco moco is perfect, portion is definitely large, I only eat a little more than half of my plate. They don't take American Express, which is not a big deal but the fact that they put Amex logo and crosses it out with a red \"X\" kinda too much in my opinion, it's almost like they have a big problem with Amex.",

When we got here, we were originally surprised at the line, but we decided to put ourselves on the waitlist for about a 30 minute wait. Luckily, they had a great waitlist system that tracked the people ahead of us and texted us when we were ready to be seated, so we could wander around instead of waiting around.  We were pleasantly surprised when we got seated after 20 minutes. For the food, I ordered the Spinach Bennie, and it was the best-flavored I've ever had. The staff is also very nice, and gave amazing service. I would recommend this place over any of the overpriced food at the Strip.",

While this may seem to be a rather strange thing to rate, a lot of breakfast places overlook the breakfast potatoes, even though half your plate comprises of these carbs.  The other breakfast foods are solid. I got the eggs Benedict and they drowned it in hollandaise sauce. I hate it when places drizzle that delicious egg butter concoction and am so glad to have found a place that isn't afraid of it. My husband always gets the typical egg sausage breakfast and he is always happy because in all honesty, he really comes out for those potatoes.  I've also had a few of the spicy omelettes and they have all been amazing. I watched my brother in law devour a four egg omelette. He ate through the pain because even though it's rather large, it was so delicious that leaving any behind would have been a crime.   Check in for a free banana muffin that's warm and goes to wonderfully with a cup of coffee.  Also, it's always busy here, even though it's a bit off the strip and the middle of the week. It doesn't matter, it's worth the trek",

I also sort of felt rushed when there because when your sitting down the servers are like in a hurry to get to you order and get you out. I guess that is how they want to make their atmosphere location. I would  go there if others would want to meet there but I would rather go to another location. Also the first time I thought the food was different but it turns out the place is the same as Egg Works, not sure why there are two companies with different names, but I would rather go to my other location. The food was good just felt like it was cramped in there and couldn't get out soon enough.",

I got the western and subbed egg whites, no cheese, turkey bacon and no butter, with fruit instead of potatoes. Forgot my coffee but that wasn't anything to bad, also our waiter mixed up our ticket with another table. Service was good minus those couple things, very prompt on getting food out, they have a quick turn around so if you see people outside waiting don't be to afraid to stop in. Facility was little aged, and not the cleanest but that comes with the age of the place.",

Seems like the majority of the breakfasts are extremely heavy. Mine was loaded with soooo much cheese. Like do people really eat that much cheese?? geezus. They do have healthier options and the option of cooking without oil for example. And I could have asked for light cheese - I just didn't know that I would need to!

One day I was hungry and I happen to pass by so I try giving it a shot again. And let me tell you it's a much better-experienced compare to what happened a decade ago.   Our server Denize recommend us the Patty Melt. When I took that first bite I have to say my doubts about the place disappeared. The cheese compliments the patty so much it felt like it melted into my mouth. The fries were seasoned just about right. Denize also gave me a complimentary banana muffin which was a nice addition; it's fresh and warm. Assuming she's a seasoned server she knew what the customer truly wants. I no longer have doubts about Egg and I. I recommended this place to anyone that happens to pass by the area it's a few blocks away from the Strip.",

Beyond that I try to get a bit of everything since I can usually only stomach only so much! I recommend this place!",

Second, they have a system in place so you never have to wait longer than a couple seconds for anything (whether it's more water, ketchup, your order).  The food is really good!! I've never tried anything I didn't like here and they're consistently good! Their coffee is my absolute favorite coffee, it's rich and full of flavor.   My favorite items:  - Their skillets are really good, esp. The bacon & onion one.  - Avocado bacon & cheese omlette  - Banana bread french toast  - Pancakes  It's a great place for a fuss free brunch, sweatpants and hangover included.",

Apart from having the cutest name ever, Egg & I has THE best banana nut muffin I've ever had in my life.  So moist, so warm.  So delicious.  Their bacon, avocado and cheese omelet had just the right balance of cheese and fillings, although a little more bacon could never hurt anybody... Orange juice was freshly squeezed and a bit pulpy, which a nice surprise :)  A nice, comfortable, and homey place to recover with generous portions and awesome staff.  Definitely recommended.",

It's a nice change-of-pace versus the Strip and a mere ten minute drive but not worth the added expense if you plan on cabbing.  Parking is plentiful and there is a delicious bakery with some of the stickiest baklavas in the same strip mall to warmup while you wait (ranging from 10 to 30 min).  Prices are reasonable, service is shoddy, and luckily one cannot mess up eggs.  Food wasn't greasy for whatever's thats worth.  As you may have guessed menu is egg-centric but fear not.  I decided to change things up during my latest visit and ordered hawaiian food.  Yep, you read that right and my internal organs as of a week later remain intact.  They offer: loco moco, spam and eggs and portuguese sausage and eggs.  Ordered both the spam and portuguese sausage and had no regrets.  Forgot the name of the breakfast burrito with the chorizo but it was dense AF and subsequently awesome.  Their homefries are also a must.",

    "text": "Thanks to Yelp and the good ol community of yelpers out there i know A LOT of places where 10 bucks can go a LONG way in providing some good eats.  My Buddy recommended The Egg & I after hearing some good things about it from other sources. I've driven by this place multiple times and it's caught my attention a few time while in the same plaza as B&C Camera.   They have a diverse menu of egg related items. I was about to order one of the combo skillets because another table's home fries looked GOOD but ended up getting a Hawaiian themed plate which featured Portuguese Sasuage or Spam (went for the sausage), rice, two eggs any style (sunny side up), \"sticky\" rice (turned out to be calrose rice). Also came with a choice of what ever bread or the banana nut muffin everyone raves about.   I choose the muffin and man oh man it did not disappoint. Blueberry's always been my favorite muffin and to be honest i havent eaten enough muffins in my life time. If i were in a situation where the entire fate of humanity rested upon my recommendation for a muffin it would be The Egg & I's banana nut hands own, sorry humanity you had your chance i'm throwing this one out and if it lands under the bus so be it.   Overall the island favorite plate was good, obviously the Portuguese sausage made the dish but in all honesty it wasnt worth the price. Even with the banana nut muffin dreams are made of it still wasnt quite worth it. For the same price my buddy got one of the combo skillets and he ended up easily with three times more food then i did.  So far i do like this place. Outdoor seating was available immediately seeing as it was a cold morning but their heaters are very powerful and aside from a few gusts of wind there was very little outdoor discomfort. Looking at other people's plate was very easy on the eyes as their selection of food is diverse yet seeing common dishes amongst different diners makes me want to come back and get what they're getting because they cant all be wrong.",

We waited for more than an hour and I felt the waitresses could have done a better job telling us real time updates about wait time. I wouldn't say it was worth the wait but I can say the food here was really good nonetheless.  First and foremost they do have a mini selection of alcohol, hahah because why not? You're in Vegas! Mimosas, screwdrivers, bloodymarry's and as well as other basic mixed drinks as well!   If possible you can check in on yelp and they give you a free banana nut muffin! This is a must order!! I want to say it was the most softest and moist muffin I have ever had. Once it gets on the table, cut it in half and smother it with butter. Yes, I said butter, believe me it will change your life.   I had the country fried steak breakfast and it was bomb. Not all breakfast spots can cook fried steak as well as this restaurant! Very crispy and juicy at the same time. I loved their gravy that went with the steak. The hash potatoes were seasoned perfect! Not sure what kind of spice was used but it was similar to cajun. I loved it though! The portion amount was endless. I'd recommend this dish if you love fried steak.   My girlfriend had a bacon avocado omelet and that was a handful as well! You'll see in my pictures that the omelet was huge!! We honestly could have shared. Everyone at the table enjoyed their meal and of course we had to have some mimosas! Overall, I'd come back here but at a time where there isn't that much of a wait. By the way they do close at 3 PM.",

The potato's sounds like they will be spicy on the menu but they are not. They even sell the seasoning so you can take it home!  Highly recommend. Especially for the price compared to the strip.",

They serve a variety of items- eggs benedicts, omelets, has, scrambled eggs, French toast, pancakes, waffles, skillets, crepes, salads, coups, sandwiches, wraps, burgers, Hawaiian specialties, & more!  Make sure to check in on Yelp to get their famous Banana Nut Muffin for free!  Spinach Benny:  With crispy bacon instead of Canadian bacon.  Served with Habla Diablo potatoes.  I was nervous that the potatoes would be too spicy but it was actually more flavorful than spicy.  Loved the hollandaise sauce.  Make sure to try their hot sauce at the table because like the Habla Diablo seasoning, it is more flavorful than spicy.",

The eggs were scrambled to perfection, just look at my photo.  Prices: a skillet will run you around $12.  Parking: ample, it's located in a large strip plaza.  People: fun for all, they also have high chairs for infants.  Perks: the food is delicious. The staff are excellent. They close at 3pm, so this isn't a late night joint. Although there's plenty of seating it gets busy fast. Especially during weekends.",

Yelp helped us find this place.  Atmosphere - Part of a strip mall.  It feels like this place has been here for decades.  Not the place is worn down but just the style of woods, tables, and the art.  Food   Drink - Coffee and I actually was given and insulated coffee pot.  Woot Woot!  I would have finished that thing off but I have a long car ride in front of me.    Breakfast - The Mexican omelette, it had me with chorizo.  The jalapenos were a nice touch too.  I think most of the heat came from the Habla Diablo salsa, which they advertise on the back of the menu.  Side of cubed home fries went well with the omelette.  That four egg omelette was filling.    Service - Our waitress was great.  Like a diner you pay the cashier near the door.  Future - Sure.  Now I am curious about Egg Works, their other restaurants listed on the menu.",

It made me wonder what it's like on the weekends.   Their menu was formatted like a newspaper (too cute) and there were so many options it took us a good 10 mins to decide on what to order. Everything sounded good. They had everything from traditional American breakfast and Tex-Mex to Hawaiian plates and more.   I redeemed the Yelp check-in offer for the free banana nut muffin and they were gracious enough to hook everyone up at the table. My goodness, was it good. Warm, fluffy and moist. Very great start to our dining experience and surely got us excited for our entrees. Please, please redeem that free muffin.   Everything that we ordered was flavorful, delicious and filling. Amen to their portions. Their breakfast potatoes were seasoned well (you can buy their seasoning) and quite crunchy. Our bellies were happy and the hanger was tamed. Major plus for bottomless coffee.  It was a bit chilly that morning (in the 50s) but we were starved and had no time to waste so we decided to sit outside. If you decide to dine al fresco, know that you'll be joined by lots of pigeons! Didn't bother us too much while eating but once you're done with plates you might have to shoo them away.   This place is definitely worth the trek from the Strip (it's not that far) and it's a decades-long favorite by locals and tourists alike :)",

It was like they mashed it up instead of chopping up the meat. I liked their hash browns and banana muffin! My husband loves their sausage and biscuits. I stick to regular eggs over easy next time. I also noted no grape jelly. Strawberry, blackberry and orange jellies to choose from. Their service is very good and the waitress was very attentive in refilling the iced tea and coffee at our table. It was a weekday and very slow, but I think the weekends are pretty busy.

We put our name on the waitlist for a 35 minute wait and just as we were going to walk away because it was a ton of people waiting to eat, a patron said that \"it's worth the wait.\" She even said she would keep us hostage if we didn't say we would stay. Lol!   We obliged and stayed. Excellent decision on our part! The place is sort of a dive, located nowhere near the strip, but oh so worth the Uber or Lyft ride here. It stays packed on a Sunday, which is the day we visited, but the line moved fairly fast. They apparently have take-out and show a few NFL games on a few tv's throughout the restaurant, and they have outdoor seating. Only open until 2pm, they specialize in breakfast/brunch/lunch foods.   I ordered the chicken enchilada omelet and it was so authentic and delicious, just visualizing it now, is making my mouth water! Delicious!!! I'm so glad that woman told us it was worth waiting because it truly was! One thing I noticed, was a lot of the great places to eat, weren't even on the Strip! This was a great find, thanks Yelp!!",

Their food is great too and the portions are enough to share so make sure you come hungry. Now keep in mind they can also do 1/2 orders on omelettes.

So Egg and I pretty much describes the story of my life. This place is roughly 10-15 mins away from the strip so there was no wait like all the other crazy famous Vegas brunch spots and that's 10 extra bonus points!  Like I mentioned I'm a crazy egg person so ordering brunch was never difficult for me. I would always always ALWAYS order an omelette but no joke, it took me more than 10 mins to decide what I wanted here since almost everything had eggs in it and there were so many choices! But of course i ended up getting the work omelette and we also ordered carnitas something (I was so hungry and forgot to note the name). The omelette was okay nothing special or different for everywhere else but the potato on the side was AMAZING! The other dish was also super good- I've never had carne asada that's so flavorful and delicious! I cannot wait to come back again and try the other dishes they have!  Oh did I mention, instead of stretching your neck out to track down your waiter/waitress, you can flip the \"egg sign\" and someone will swing by to attend to your needs. Awesome!",

On my last two visits prior to the one I'm writing about (this past Monday, Memorial Day), Jesus has asked me if I needed anything to let him know, which he did again on this visit. Jesus is ALWAYS willing to help, and has gotten me coffee, filled my coffee and even scored me an extra banana nut muffin or two before. Not really his job, as his is to clean tables and make sure their customers have somewhere nice to be seated, but Jesus ALWAYS goes above and beyond what is expected of him to do, and I appreciate his hard work.  Which brings me to Brady, the young Assistant Manager. Brady is definitely young enough to be my little brother. Brady is a genuine, bonafide talker. He shoots the shit with you, but real talk. Not fake talk like I'm only here to make it look like I care about you talk, but good ol' fashioned back and forth banter. He has a tattoo on one of his forearms that says \"Family First\", and Brady made me feel like family! While shooting it with him, I told him that we had just come from Laughlin but had to detour cause one of my wife's uncles fell ill and ended up in the hospital and guess what Brady did? He sent me home with a loaf of their bomb ass banana nut bread to take to my uncle at the hospital since I told him that's where we were heading after breakfast! THANK YOU AGAIN BRADY! I'LL NEVER FORGET YOUR KINDNESS!  I'll end this review with a little bit about the food.........my Italiano skillet was on point, AS USUAL. Onion, bell pepper and sausages were all cooked to damn near perfection, it had just the right amount of marinara and cheese that didn't drown or overwhelm, and to be quite honest, have they every messed up a batch of their famous potatoes?",

The hot sauce was bomb also so I bought a small bottle for the trip home.",

The muffin was very moist and sweet with few nuts, just the way I like it.  The eggs Benedict, though traditional and simple, was perfect and filling. It made its way to the top of my list of favorite eggs Benedicts. The hollandaise sauce was one of the best I've had. This dish alone will have me coming back if I ever make a trip back to Vegas.  Our server was also very accommodating to our party of 9 and super friendly.",

First tip when dining here is  Bring a dolly to roll you out of here when your done with their delicious food.   Count on waiting for about 30 to 40 min but believe me its so worth the wait.  We had the privilege of having Veronica as our superstar waitress and her team of bussers who couldnt be more helpful and nicer.   I had the traditional benny that was cooked to an ooey gooey of egg perfection  Our girls had the mouse pancake that were super cute and fluffy  Hubby had a french toaat sandwich  He did wish he had asked for sunny side up but was still  Satisfying and huge might i add.  My son had a club style burger which was a monster serving  I would say he was happy because there was not a piece left behind.   When visiting Vegas this will definitely be our go to breakfast spot.  And before i forget order the banana muffin with some coffee. Thats a must!!  Thank you Egg and I team for welcoming our family into your restaurant.",

    "text": "The Egg and I, and Chicken Fried Steak!  Experience:  I met some friends for early lunch or late breakfast.  It was pretty busy for 11:00 on a Thursday.    Facility:  fairly good size place with a dinner atmosphere. There were murals on the walls,  and typical tables and chairs with some half booth seating too.   Service:  not the best service I ever had, but not the worst. Doesn't seem to be one set waitress per table...this can be a good or bad thing. It took a good 10 minutes before someone took my drink order, we had to flag someone a few times, and after the food came, no one did the check back to make sure we didn't need anything else....but when they did help us, they were friendly and quick.   Food:  a girlfriend and I decided to split two meals, so we could try more.  We ordered the \"Chili Relleno Eggs Benedict\" special, and we got the \"chicken fried steak with over easy eggs and banana nut muffin.\"   The muffin came out warm and it was pretty tasty.  Would have been perfect if they served some butter with it.  The Benedict was good. I love the chili taste that cut the richness of the Benedict.  The chicken fried steak was good, but not the best I ever had. It was crispy outside and a nice southern white gravy on the side to dip it in. I really did enjoy the hash brown potatoes on the side.  When they first came out, I thought I wouldn't like them because they looked to have too much seasoning on them.  However, they actually had just the right amount, and it had a Lawrys season salt flavor.   Overall:  I would definitely come back here again. They have so many good things in the menu I want to try.  See yah soon!!",

The waitress did a excellent job explaining the menu to me and letting me know how I could customize my order. Everything I asked for was promptly brought out.  While not the best sausage gravy I have had in Vegas, it was still decent on it's own and still better than most of the sausage gravy I have had in Vegas. Nice amount of sausage throughout with a nice homemade flavor. I do believe it was made in house. But it still had the consistency of being out of a packet. The biscuits weren't as soft and tender as I would have liked, but still passable.  The bacon I got was on point. They were straight and crispy. I asked for the eggs to be extra soft. They were okay, but it was weird, the top half of the pile was cooked how I wanted, but the bottom half was cooked hard. I'm  guessing they were left on too long and not continually scrambled.   All together, I enjoyed my meal, but I am still looking for well made biscuits and gravy in Las Vegas. I will come back to try other items on the menu.",

What ever I order I make sure the item comes with potatoes or I get them in the side. If you are a fan of banana but muffins then you will honestly love theirs. Always moist and fresh out the oven. I've been to Egg works which is the same business but for some reason I prefer the Egg and I more.",

The breakfast menu is one of the most diverse that I've ever encountered. 4-egg omelettes and scrambles seem to be the rule in Las Vegas. The Egg & I omelettes were delicious and loaded with cheese. We had a veggie omelette and a veggie scramble. The potatoes were seasoned just right. Reading prior Yelp reviews beforehand, I doubted that the banana nut muffins could live up to the hype. Boy was I wrong. Excellent. Fluffy and not too heavy on the banana. Prepare for a large crowd and a wait on the weekend. The hostesses were very pleasant and friendly. The bus staff too. And our server, Tamara, was a delight.",

I ordered the chicken enchilada omelet and it was beyond delicious very flavorful and the tortilla chips on the top was the icing on the cake! Their hash browns are seasoned so well and you can tell everything was made to order.  The only reason I did not give it 5 Stars was because it took a long time for us to get water and when we did they only brought one instead of 3 & we also did not have silverware.  But our waitress was nice the service was good and I have already recommended this place to some of my friends and family.",

The staff is super friendly, they are great at keeping your coffee cup full. Also, what's cool is that when you have an issue or need something they have an egg on the table, you can flip it to reveal a sad, yellow egg. Someone is usually at your table within 30 seconds. It's like they have sonar for these yellow eggs.  The Egg & I serves breakfast and lunch and they close at like 3 PM.",

When we were seated, the server was prompt and attentive. From there it was all down hill.  It too 30-40 minutes to get our food. Really? For egg dishes? Our food was cold. I had asked for my eggs basted medium. They came fried, sunny side up. The salsa that came with my wife's huevos rancheros was bland. That was better than my tasteless food. The cream cheese for my bagel was in a small metallic packet. It was so cold I could barely get it out.  Neither of us finished our food. I don't know how anyone could want to. I was still tasting my greasy \"cordon bleu skillet\" breakfast hours later.  Maybe I was just unfortunate, but bland, cold food and an unreasonable length of time to have the food delivered to the table means this is the 2nd time we will go there: first and last.",

    "text": "Summary:  Perhaps the best breakfast restaurant I've ever found.  Long version:  So I'm on vacation with my two adult sons (and one of the boy's GF).  Since we're at a timeshare I'm enjoying making breakfast most of the week.  On a lark I decide we're going out, and I google \"best las vegas breakfast\".  #1 on the list is \"The Egg and I\".  So we map it and off we go, without a lot of expectations or knowing what's on the menu.    So first of all there's a bit of a wait - 15-20 minutes for a table.  Staff is friendly, place is clean, and every table is filled.  We are seated outdoors on the patio and there are heaters set up (the stand-up propane ones) every couple of tables so we're nice and cozy.  Coffee comes and guess what - it's really good.  I'm a bit of a coffee fanatic - I roast my own beans at home and can distinguish varietals between African and South American by taste - and it's surprisingly lively on the palette for a breakfast joint.  Between the four of us, we order a vegan breakfast, two different omelets and biscuits and gravy.  Each entry is under $10, and the portions are absolutely ginormous.  It's a quarter to midnight and I'm still stuffed.    But most importantly, every thing on the plate is absolutely delicious.  From the specialty omelets to the potatoes to the gravy, everything is simply first rate.    Apparently the place has won several awards and is Zagat rated.  I have no reason to doubt any of this - if you're in Las Vegas for breakfast, you absolutely MUST search out and try The Egg and I.",

The chicken was tender, there was a good ratio of guacamole and mushrooms, and the omelette was smothered in cheese and sour cream. Ranch potatoes on the side were fantastic, as expected. 2) Sausage gravy + sausage patty: a little on the salty side, but I thought it had a good balance of chunkiness and creaminess. I'm a bit of a sausage gravy aficionado (haha) though, so it may be that my standards are oddly high. 3) Banana Nut Muffin: needs it's own category, even if it's a side! Delicious delicious. Moist and warm, not too sweet.  I would come back! The service was great too. Even though we came right at brunch time and the place was packed, there was only a 5 min wait for two.",

I was told the wait would be 20 minutes, but we ended up waiting closer to 50 minutes.To make matters even worse, there was a mix up in calling my party. When I first checked in with the hostess I made sure that my name was correct on the sheet and that it said caitlin, but when my \"name\" was called they called Lin???? We assumed that wasn't us because that's not even close to my name so we kept waiting. Finally after I noticed that parties that came after me were getting seated and we weren't I was getting really annoyed and it turns out that they had passed us a long time ago and they were 5 PARTIES AFTER US. When we brought it up to the hostess she tried blaming it on us saying that it was somehow our fault?? I was actually shocked like wtf?! They did nothing to try to make the matters better like I just waited 15 more minutes when I should've been seated already? Awful awful awful customer service, I don't care how good the food is or how awesome your business is doing but you've definitely lost a loyal customer",

Huge portions that had us fueled for our trip. Don't expect fancy, just a good solid breakfast with a local feel. They have an egg sign sort of thing on the table. The black egg means all is well at your table. The yellow egg signals the staff you would like assistance. We were getting pressed for time to get to the airport and wanted to-go cups for our coffee. We turned the egg to black and a staff member showed up immediately to help us out. Neat idea as this signal is not only for your waiter, but for the entire staff.  We walked in around 8:30 on a Saturday morning and were seated immediately. By the time we left there was a line out the door.  We had the Country Benny and Grandma's biscuits and gravy, both with the hash browns. Excellent choices. Anyone familiar with Bojangles on the east coast and their seasoned fries, the hash browns here have a similar flavor. Very good.",

If you are in the area, this cute little breakfast place is a definite must. The children's meal was super cute: a chocolate chip Mickey Mouse shaped pancake! And the wait time was not that long, definitely worth it. I got the chili skillet and it was so delicious. The portions are good sized and I left happy and full. The key manager Abby served us and she was so sweet and nice. Loved her!",

He gave suggestions right away, which made the ordering process a lot less stress-inducing for me, which I highly appreciate, as I have a lot of anxiety over ordering food from a menu that I'm not familiar with. He also took interest in us as customers, and asked about where we're from and made lovely conversation. I am so thrilled about my experience and will definitely be back the next time I'm in town.",

The muffin was very soft and moist, almost melt in your mouth. Very delicious. The skillet was also exceptional. The country fried steak needed a very light push of a fork for it to break apart. It was very tender and juicy.   The service was very friendly and welcoming. Our server Oscar was also very attentative and refilled our drinks before we finished drinking. That always scores huge points with me. This will definetly be a Vegas staple whenever im in town.",

I ordered Brad's Very Special Omelette with spinach, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese which was about 3 stars to me - good but not the best I've had.  I chose to have it with their famous muffin and potatoes which are delicious!    Got here around 1 p.m. on a Thursday afternoon and there were plenty of available tables.  Service was good and prompt and prices pretty low so for those reasons I can also round up from 3.5 to 4 stars.

However, that single condition to reduce it by one star is really unfair if you think about it...? 'Cause the reason it was long to get a table was the fact so many others were waiting before us, 'cause the food and value is pretty damn good.  Truly I should give it five stars. But life isn't fair, so they get four.  Notwithstanding I was standing for about 30 minutes before getting a table.  Why was I standing? I'm a glutton for punishment. Therefore I ate with a gluttonous appetite once they sat my tired ass down.",

The wait staff is very attentive to their customers. I had barely sat down and was asked if I wanted coffee or water. I said both, please.   Kai, the waitress, said \"Hello!,\" asked If I had questions. The breakfast menu has nearly anything you can think of. It's on there! She returned within a couple of minutes and took my order. Ham and eggs, with a choice of hash browns or home fries. I went the home fries,   While I was waiting someone would come along asking if I wanted coffee, I was impressed. The place was crowded with locals and some of us tourists!  The order arrived in about 10 minutes. I nearly fell out of my chair, the slice of ham nearly covered half the plate, it was lean, cooked to perfection. The home fries were not greasy and the eggs were cooked perfectly. As I prefer over medium, along with the toast.  Kai, came by at least two more times before. I ask for the check. This place had a good feel to it. By the way, it's situated in a strip mall and a person could drive by it. The words Egg and I are in yellow, the parking can get a little tight. However, the parking lot can handle the customers.   Enjoy your breakfast there !",

The menu is extensive, quite a few breakfast items to choose from. Obviously eggs are the feature here with a large omelette selection. The place is homey, and they have murals of farm lands all over the walls.   I decided to get the Mexican Omelette - Chorizo, chiles and onions and cheese, topped with sour cream. Came with a heaping side of potatoes and choice of bread - I got wheat.  Overall I was kind of underwhelmed by the dish. Usually I love chorizo, but for some reason this omelette just did not meld like it should.   Service was SLOW. Yes, it was busy on a Saturday, but there came a point when my husband looked up and said, \"Where's the food?\". Never a good sign when you actually start questioning whether or not they put the order in.  They did have a very yummy banana nut muffin, which I highly suggest getting if you come here. AND (as of this writing) if you check in on Yelp, you get one for free!  This is definitely a go-to breakfast spot if you live in the area. But, if you live elsewhere in the valley I am sure you can find a place that is just as good, if not better. I still like Black Bear Diner over Egg & I for breakfast.",

This quaint little gem is AMAZEBALLS!!  They give you menus that look like newspapers and bright yellow mugs, awaiting your coffee, adorn the tables.  Of course, as the name suggests, eggs are their specialty, but they offer much much more!  The waitress suggested I try the \"Loco Moco\" and I was not disappointed!! It was a beautifully, delicious symphony on my tongue!! Sticky rice, eggs (any way you like), hamburger patty, and brown gravy.    I know what you're thinking...\"is this chick pregnant?!\" rest assured, I'm not (any more) and this dish really made sense once I took a bite!! Just wonderfully cooked and seasoned and all the different components played nice together in the tummy!  (there's a party in my tummy...so yummy, so yummy yummy)  It's not in the nicest part of LV, but that's why I love finding these \"off-the-beaten-path\" joints!  What they lack in environment, they make up for in taste and ambiance!",

Decent, but I didn't see what all the fuss was about and especially for a place that isn't cheap. Well, I'm glad I tried it again, because now I see more of what people have been talking about. I went with a party of 8 and the service was excellent. Someone recommended the stuffed French toast and although it didn't really sound like my kind of thing I ordered it. Well, I'm glad I did because that thing is awesome! Perfectly cooked eggs with the right amount of cheese and sausage. The French toast was done just right as well. So, I suppose it really depends on what you have here and what your tastes are. For example, I tried those muffins everyone at our table was raving about and I didn't like them. Go figure!",

So I saw they had loco moco on their menu which is something I wasn't expecting. I decided to order it anyways though I wasnt sure about ordering a item at a non Hawaiian spot. It was actually really good, even better than most of the fast food style Hawaiian places as everything tasted much fresher and the gravy had good flavor.   The fiance got a apple walnut chicken sandwich which he seemed to enjoy. I took a bite and it's solid as far as cold chicken salad sandwiches go.   The thing I like is they are always friendly here. I really liked our server as she was just chipper.   It's always busy here so I avoid the peak times to not have to wait, but if you go later in the afternoon like we did, there's no one there. 1 hour wait for breakfast time or no wait for breakfast at lunch....I'll pick the no wait!

For as fresh as this place is... Taking a short cut and using food service potatoes....would have thought better..but not enough to drip a star!!    Thanks Jessica...great job!!",

The muffin was kind of sticky like they pull them out of the freezer to thaw. So we didn't enjoy that but everything else was spot on.   My husband had the mashed potato omelette and my dad had the biscuits and gravy. I had the veggie omelet, all of the above were great!",

Needless to say the reviews of this place are True.   Let's address cons.   It's off the strip  It has a decent wait time to be served. Place was packed and it's worth noting but they clean tables and have people seated as fast as possible.   Pros.   Food is great. I have paid triple for similar food. And I had the cabo breakfast burrito which is and easy item to mess up. Sause was dryer and baked on so it did not cause the burrito to become soggy. Was crisp without too much grease.   Great customer service.   I will be eating here again before I leave is how much I truly enjoyed my self.   Wife would want me to give it a 4.5 because they used too much cheese on her omelet however it said cheesy so I blame her.",

We decided to check this place out after reading the glowing reviews on Yelp, and we were not disappointed.  We arrived around 10:15am on a Sunday and the place was packed! There was a line outside the door of people waiting. However, the wait was quite fast and our party of 6 was seated in about 20 min. The service was excellent - our waitress Alexa was super friendly and took our complicated drink and food orders with ease. Any one with a Yelp account can also check in to receive a free banana nut muffin, which was huge, warm, and full of banana flavor. It was one of the best banana nut muffins I have tasted. In addition, coffee comes with unlimited refills!   Our table ordered: Bacon and sliced avocado omelette ($11.25): excellent. The omelette was huge and stuffed with ample chunks of whole avocado, bacon bits, and topped with a generous amount of melted Jack cheese and a dollop of sour cream. There was also a side of buttered toast and a choice of home fries, cottage cheese, or fruit (I think this is offered with any egg dish). Delicious, and a large portion size for one person.  Heart stopper skillet special ($10.25): this was my favorite dish that our table ordered. It was one of the specials and consisted of a layer of works potatoes topped with bacon, ham, and sausage and smothered in homemade country style gravy and two sunny-side up eggs. The gravy and the runny egg yolks mixed with the potatoes and meat created a delicious creamy explosion of flavor and umami.  Southwestern Cobb salad ($10.50): a huge salad with a ton of toppings. I was impressed that there was very little lettuce, and instead a lot of delicious toppings such as taco seasoned chicken, black bean and corn relish, tomatoes, black olives, bacon, cheddar cheese, tortilla strips, and a whole sliced avocado (amazing!) with chipotle ranch dressing.  Sundance special omelette ($11.25): veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts and Swiss cheese topped with tomatoes and feta cheese. You can also add chicken for an extra $2.50. The feta cheese melded perfectly with the creamy egg flavor and the various vegetables.   Overall, I highly recommend this place for brunch. Service was super friendly and efficient, and the food is great value for the portion size and the price!",

The biscuits and gravy were to die for and the bacon was cooked just the way I like it: crunchy.  My husband loved that they offered True maple syrup for his pancakes; don't usually have that option. Our waitress gave us, as first time visitors, a fresh-baked banana nut muffin. A truly great dining experience.",

Why only 3 Stars? 1st star - originality of the place: the seating arrangement is really unique. the center dinning area is high up and the side dinning area is ground level.  2st star - menu has a ton of choices! a lot of different ways to serve egg for breakfast and more: burgers, salad, sandwiches, and steaks.  3rd star - service is good even though they could get so busy each server was alert and ready to serve customers who need help. Also, they have this EGG SIGN on each table where you put the WEIRD EGG FACE if you need service lol   Food was okay, but I totally blamed my self for ordering my egg wrong. Apparently, I could order my egg \"scrambled easy\" so it won't be so dry. Oh well, there is always next time. Definitely will come back to try more of their stuff and of course! update my review for my fellow yelpers.",

    "text": "Ordered avocado, they didn't put it on my meal. Told the waitress they forgot it and to forget about bringing it. She began to goad me on to get avocado, which was strange after saying no several times. I repeated that it was fine; at that point i didn't care for it. Eventually I submitted but asked for only a little amount of avocado. She brings me avocado and soon after - the check. I look at the check, no avocado charge. I was happy, and ready to pay. A few minutes later, she sneakily replaces the check with a brand new one. I hardly noticed that she had done that and after looking at the check again, a $3 avocado charge made me cringe. Wtf? If it was your mistake and I said I was fine on avocado, why would you goad me on to get it? Then give me a check without it (again forgetting, but this time you forgot to charge me so might as well leave it), and replace it with a ridiculous charge? And do not call your customers \"babe\", it's just weird especially when you say it behind them. \"Thanks babe\" - as I was holding the check in my hand. Thanks? No thanks lol.I wish I remembered her name, but she was some older red-haired lady. I was not pleased with this incident. Also, their \"Habla Diablo\" potatoes, which comes with every meal, are horrendous. They taste like over seasoned, beyond-salty fast food potatoes. 2 stars for getting seated quick, polite service, and a banana \"nut\" muffin for a side, despite the fact that it was overly sweet and did not receive the slightest bit of nutty flavor. Be weary of such scenario as I have endured. For these reasons, I would not consider returning.",

Be prepared to wait in line! There is usually some time of wait in the morning to brunch. I would definitely recommend trying to get there as early as possible. When I first walked in, I thought...hmm this looks like a glorified Denny's. However, the painting on the wall was cute but the the rest of the restaurant was a bit dated in decor. However, it was easy to ignore all of that and realize that every seat was packed with a combination of locals and visitors to the great city of Las Vegas.   Being a more health conscious eater, I ordered a egg white veggie omelette. My husband ordered the combination of eggs over easy and banana nut pancakes. Both were excellent, high quality ingredients and well made. The best part was getting the bill which was just a little over $20. That amount would barely cover one person's entrance into a mediocre Vegas strip brunch buffet.",

    "text": "I was really enthusiastic to try this place, based on the good Yelp reviews.  What I found was a nice coffee shop.  The service was very attentive, but the food was mediocre.  Maybe we missed the point, because neither my wife nor I wanted a breakfast consisting of \"hot sauce with something under it,\" which seems to be the specialty of the house.  So, for example, we both ordered ordinary hash browns instead of the potatoes \"diablo\" (or something like that).  The hash browns we got were clearly pre-frozen patties - not quite as good as the ones you get a Trader Joe's.  My stuffed french toast, and my wife's eggs benedict were very ordinary.  And the prices were at the higher end of the reasonable range.  I can't see any reason for us to go back to this place.  For now, our three favorite breakfasts on the West Side remain the Black Bear Diner, Hash House a Go Go, and the buffet at Orleans.",

    "text": "When you're in Sin City and breakfast comes to mind, many people might think the breakfast buffets on the Strip hit the spot. Don't get me wrong, those are good. However, if you are looking for something a little off the beaten path for the BEST spot for breakfast in Las Vegas, look no further because the \"Egg and I\" will have you covered. With an astounding 2,500 reviews (as of October), its no wonder why this place has near-perfect Yelp reviews.   I've actually had this place bookmarked forever as I finally got the opportunity to dine here with my lady on the morning of Saturday 9/30/17. Located directly on West Sahara Ave. (and adjacent to Arville St.), Egg and I is located in the Westside neighborhood of Las Vegas and only about a 10 minute drive from the Strip. Parking especially during breakfast hours can be very challenging as there are other business here. But the majority of people the park in this lot dine here.  Since we had arrived around 10:45am, we park quite a distance from the main entrance. The exterior is very rustic and looks like your mom & pop place. The interior has a very cozy and charming feel to it. Since the weather was a perfect 76, we decided on dining at their generous outdoor patio. Since I was still tired (after not crashing until 3:30am and waking up at 7:30am), I ordered coffee. What is nice is that they give me the entire carafe of coffee! And lots of liquid creamers to go with it. Score! And our server was very sweet, attentive, and took care of us in a timely manner.  Their menu is very extensive; they have a huge variety of Eggs Benedicts, omelettes, corned beef hash, French toast, pancakes, waffles, and crepes. I finally decide on ordering their \"Bacon & Onion Skillet\" (for $9.99). My lady opted for \"The Classic\" which are two-eggs (she chose over easy) w/toast and Godshall's turkey bacon. Both of us receive their signature Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. Even though business was at full capacity, both our breakfast platters arrive in just 10 minutes.  I've got to say, I was very impressed with what I received. There is something magical about these potatoes because the seasoning in them was addictive! And the bed of eggs over the ooey-gooey cheese made every savory bite a heavenly experience. I had the opportunity of trying some of her turkey bacon and damn, this was flavorful and on point! For the price you pay, you will get enough food to carry you through the rest of the day. In fact, my next meal wasn't until around 8 hours later at 7:30pm.  A little added bonus, if you check-in on the Yelp app, they will give you their signature Banana Nut Muffin. However, we got so much food that even more carbohydrates with that muffin would equal a massive food coma. Overall, the \"Egg and I\" is definitely a place worth checking out. A great family-owned experience, quality food, excellent prices, and stellar service makes this one of the easiest five-star ratings I've given in quite some time!",

Very good muffin that still hot when they served it to you.  Blackened Prime Ribs Benny  Veggie Benny (add mushroom)   Both are great. So much flavor but not too heavy. Perfect portion for 1 person. I personally love the veggie Benny a lot. Light and healthy! I'm so glad that I ask to add the mushroom, makes all the flavor even better.",

    "text": "Not even sure how we found this place (thanks to Siomara for that!) but glad we did. Were staying on the Strip, but wanted a good and reasonably priced breakfast before a long road trip, so here we came. The place is in a small mallish shopping center about 15 minutes from us (the Excalibur) but worth the drive. Busy as all get out, but we found out why in short order. The menu is extensive, and if you can't find something you like then you're just not hungry!  We had an avocado and bacon omelette, bacon maple cream french toast and an egg dish I've never heard of previously, the \"Fiesta skillet.\" All were large, delicious and filling. The house featured Habla Diablo salsa was exceptionally good, with a nice thicker consistency than I expected and just enough heat to accompany but not overwhelm the dishes it was in (in our case, my Fiesta skillet). The service was good and attentive, considering how busy it was. Tables were cleared quickly and reset for the next guests with practiced speed. We were even treated to a complimentary house made banana nut muffin. When I ordered a \"muffin\" for my toast, thinking \"English\" I was given a banana nut muffin. I didn't know this, and the waitress was kind enough to bring the English muffin as well for no charge, so we all had our fill of these dark, moist and so sweet (but not too bananey!) muffins! Sooooo good! As for prices and servings, none of us left hungry and there were leftovers to take as well - and for all 3 adults we paid less than ONE buffet price at Harrah's the previous day. Definitely a place to consider (there are several locations under the Egg and I and the Egg Works branding), and if you don't like eggs check out their salads, sandwiches and burger menus - you'll find something!",

The free muffin with Yelp check-in was delicious and warm - more like a yummy and soft banana bread. I opted for a biscuits and sausage benny and my partner got the cordon bleu skillet. Both meals were served fast and hot. Potatoes were crispy and seasoned and eggs cooked perfectly. I loved having the option to pick a flavored coffee creamer, too. This place knows what they're doing and they're doing it well. Would return and recommend for a hearty Vegas breakfast!",

Karla was our waitress & she was the best!  Answered all our questions & was very attentive. The staff were all on point. From hostess to bus & kitchen staff. The food was great with reasonable prices. They had the best breakfast selections to choose from.

HOLY COW.  friends wanted to try this for lunch when we were in the area and i had high hopes for this place. wait for a little over 10 people was a long wait as this place is super busy. once we got seated we noticed the place was packed and our service ended up being horrible. i guess they utilize these egg signs on the tables to indicate if we need help or not and look. we were the unhappy eggs of the place. sat down and ran out of menus. we waited for over 10 minutes then got menus. after we all decided what we wanted to order it took another 10 minutes to get someone to help take our order. the guy who took our order kept hitting my friend's chair as he took his order over 20 times. after we ordered our food took an okay amount of time to come out. once it came out no one could eat because they ran out of utensils and he had to ask wishing a 15 minute period three different waiters to get us utensils (how long could this possibly take?) then we ate our food. EVERYTHING WAS SO SALTY.  i had the burger and fries (i know who gets a burger here but its what i wanted and when you have such a large selection it truly suffered). my burger came WITHOUT onions. i was confused had to ask the waiter if they give onions and he was like they should. patty was cooked with no seasoning at all. bland. tomatoes were frozen. nothing special on it like damn i know its a plain burger but its so bad... NEVER GET THE BURGER. fries were the most salty thing I've ever tasted in my life. like wow. I'm a person who licks my plate clean and i didn't finish this plate at all. biggest waste of my money. i tried my other friends dishes and we all agreed all the dishes were salty. not acceptable.  don't recommend unless you want salty ass food for days. one star is just for the free yummy banana muffin for checking in...",

If that doesn't sound appealing to you, they have a lengthy menu of options (including those that are healthy) that will make it difficult to decide. In my opinion, the menu primarily consists of classics and southwest combinations, however, I also noted Island/Hawaiian style selections. It's somewhat of an odd array, but you can't go wrong.   The restaurant is located in an isolate shopping plaza with plenty of parking. Wait times are long; I suggest you plan for an hour of that (during peak times), with limited seating, so you may have to stand outside with the overflow. However, once seated, the service is very fast and friendly.   During a recent visit, we received a gigantic, banana nut muffin with each Yelp check in.",

    "text": "This is a great breakfast/brunch spot just off the strip as an alternative to the hotel buffets. Like all popular brunch spots, the lines are usually out the door - literally. So if you're visiting Vegas in the summer heat, keep in mind that you may be cooking for awhile.  If you check-in, you get one of their AMAZING banana nut muffins on the house! They're almost the size of a Costco muffin, so be careful not to fill up too much if you plan to enjoy their menu items (although it's easier said than done when it pairs so well with their house coffee).  Their menu is filled with enticing options - both savory and sweet. If you're like me, and literally groan in pain from indecision, you should persuade/harangue/guilt/extort your friends to split a 3rd entree! I ended up getting the \"blackened prime rib benny\" ($14.25), which is an eggs benedict with prime rib, bell peppers, and spinach over a grilled croissant.  Like most of their savory dishes, it comes with their famous \"habla diablo\" seasoned potatoes, which resembles a creole-seasoning, but tastes fantastic and every serving can feed a small family of four! The eggs benedict itself was decent, though not eye-popping like their potatoes or muffins.  The pancakes (diced apples and cinnamon, 3 stack for $8.25) and french toasts (Hawaiian $8.99) that I forced my friends to get are huge, fluffy, and satisfyingly filling. For the apple and cinnamon pancakes, they put the cooked apples on the side, which is great if you don't want to be at the mercy of the restaurant's preferences.  On top of the reasonably-priced food and gigantic portions, the service is fantastic, and the staff is very friendly! If you get seated on the patio during the hot summers, the misters do a pretty decent job of keeping you cool, and the staff ensures that your cups will always be filled with water.",

Our waitress Lacey was very helpful and nice, got everything we needed and checked up on us. The food we ordered also came out pretty quick too.  I got the Strawberry Cream Cheese stuffed French Toast and of course the free check-in Banana Nut Muffin which was just fabulous! Others got the Veggie Skillet, Huevos Rancheros, Country Fried Steak Skillet, etc. First of all, my order was just amazing as I thought it would be. My other favorite was the veggie skillet, we did low-sodium for that and it was just perfect! It was the best out of all the dishes. However, the CFS skillet was a bit too salty for our tastes and the huevos rancheros was just ok. Portions were more than enough and price-wise it's more on the affordable side when you think of LV breakfasts for just under and over $10.  Overall honestly this place isn't above average compared to other breakfast places in LV, just ok.",

    "text": "So when I am out traveling, one of my most favorite meals in the history of the world is breakfast. And I usually like my breakfasts to be big, home style, and comfortable. So on my last trip to Vegas, rather than brave the elements of the casino buffet, I decided to get in my car and venture around the city and hit up some of the local spots.  Of course, I hit up Yelp to find out what the breakfast scene was in Las Vegas, and it led me to The Egg & I. This place is located in a strip mall, and has really really good parking. But that's just the small stuff, let's get into the real treasure within.  Right off the bat, you feel totally at home in this place. It's got all the elements of one of those quaint little hometown diners that you know and love and probably grew up with. The staff there is super attentive, and honestly made me feel so welcome as soon as I walked into the door.   I didn't have to wait long at all for someone to come up to my table and asked me what I want to drink. As I slipped on my coffee and looked at the menu, they had a wide variety of stuff to choose from. I settled on the combo plate which had two pancakes scrambled eggs and my choice of sausage, bacon, or sausage patties. I went for the link sausage, because they said that was absolutely the hot ticket. And of course, long-time readers of my Yelp reviews will know that I always order a glass of milk with breakfast as a test for the server's attention to detail.  My breakfast was delivered by a different server and was sat down in front of me and for a brief second I thought I was going to have to make a mental note to give them one star off for forgetting my milk. When lo and behold two seconds later comes my waitress with a glass of milk. Great save on their part!  The food itself was really good the pancakes were light and fluffy, the eggs were cooked to perfection, and they were absolutely right on those link sausages ... they were the bomb diggity. The staff was really good about cruising by every once in a while and refilling my coffee and asking how things were without being overbearing. Honestly, it  felt like I was at a friend's house rather than a restaurant.  The bottom line? If you are ever out in Vegas and don't want to have to navigate through a horde of drunk people, obnoxious teenagers, or Keno players to get to your breakfast, you really have to go to The Egg & I. You won't regret it!",

My daughter has the Mexican omelet. She was in seventh heaven....eyes rolling, lips smacking, spoon licking heaven. Who could blame her? The food was really good!

Their food is always hot and delicious and their staff gives good recommendations. For the amount food you receive, you're being charged a fair price. They definitely don't gouge you. My mom and I get in and out in under $25 and that's including our tip (no, we're not stingy tippers either) their food is just reasonably priced! They are ALWAYS packed on a Sunday morning so be prepared to wait. It's not usually an excruciating wait, probably 20 minutes if you have a table of 4 or less. If you bring four generations of family then of course you're going to have to wait longer than 20 minutes but that shouldn't be a shock. I would definitely recommend your try at least one of the above mentioned items!",

One of the hosts that was taking our phone number and name to seat us when ready was very rude. She looked very unhappy, and spoke rudely with very few words: \"Phone number....Name....Number of people.\" We gave her the information and she just turned away. Some what rude. After being seated, our server was very polite and kind, an opposite from the host. It being our first visit we asked for recommendations, and he gave us a number of recommendations, from the stuffed french toast to the chili relleno omelette. Because it was our first time, he brought us free banana nut muffins on the house, as a welcome to The Egg and I! First time a restaurant has done that.   Food: 5/5 ------------------- We ordered the stuffed french toast, traditional eggs benedict, and chili relleno omelette.   Stuffed French Toast: 4/5 Scrambled eggs, cheese, and sausage sandwiched between 2 pieces of french toast. Was good but not amazing. I found it to be dry, but I'd honestly get it again.   Eggs Benedict: 5/5 The eggs were perfect, and english muffin perfect texture. However, a bit heavy with the hollandaise sauce. Overall, probably my favorite entree.   Chili Relleno Omelette: 4/5 Cooked perfectly, with lots of flavor. Unique dish with the chilis inside the omelette. Didn't get to try much of it  Habla Diablo Potatoes: 5/5 Probably some of the best potatoes I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, crispy on the outside and soft on the inside. I'd almost compare the texture to McDonalds french fries. They're seasoned with spices and we're very very good!  Banana Nut Muffins: 5/5 Best banana nut muffins I've ever had! Not too sweet and very moist. One of my favorite items we got.  Overall: 5/5 --------------- Great value, food, and customer service. Each person costs around $10-15. However, almost everyone I saw left with to-go boxes because they gave so much food!",

I ask our server Oscar if they had iced coffee, they didn't but he offered me coffee with lots of ice, it was perfect! Thanks Oscar!   Best place for breakfast in Vegas!! Wait is a bit long so we sat outside, near water mist. Not bad!",

We were sat outside, this is the only reason they did not get a five, it was fresh but the pigeons were a little annoying. It did not help that someone thought giving the birds bread.  The food was good inexpensive and plentiful. It was served within minutes. They also leave a carafe of coffee at the table. If you check in with YELP app you get a banana nut muffin for free. If you do not mind the wait you should stop by. They also offer a military discount.",

I had to lug the goodness in the car all the way back to OC and then back down to SD! See the love for the muffin and for the sister! I delivered a muffin from so freaking far! lol  Yes, it is THAT GOOD! I still think about it that I drool and want to drive to Vegas again just for it! lol The muffin top is flat so more chewy crisp surface area.  We all know that is the best part!   Here are the dishes I recommend.  I have had a bunch of different ones but I only order the Piggy Skillet.  It's the best of all the meat worlds! They put Crisp Bacon, Diced Ham, Pork Sausage, Potatoes, Cheese, and Eggs.. how can you go wrong! Mmmmm meaty cheesy goodness! Yes you can easily make this at home but I want the muffins! lol  The Chicken Enchilada Omelette is pretty good too.  The chicken inside is tender and flavorful paired with all the condiments on top.  All the dishes are huge and plentiful.  I can never finish it, but that can also be that I scarf down as many muffins on the table and more! lol Still the food is pretty good and the seasoned potatoes are delicious! ^_^ Yum Yum.  If you are ever in Vegas, be sure to come try it out.  I think the design of the place is cute too, very wholesome! I like the mom and pop feel with cute sweet servers that are very attentive.  I have been back many times since and will keep coming back! Muffins!!! O=p",

I ordered it with fresh strawberries which were cooked into it, but I would have preferred them raw on top. My boyfriend's skillet (the one with sausage and ham) was ok and was probably the best thing I tried there. His mother's bacon and cheese omelette was not very good and she ate less than half. The bacon they use for omlettes is the same stuff Taco Bell does... shredded little bits that tastes like some kind of pork, just not bacon. Her friend's bacon strips were extremely overcooked, dark brown and crunchy vs. crispy. The homefries were terrible. Just potatoes with A LOT of some kind of cajun seasoning all over. I thought homefries were supposed to be seasoned with salt, pepper, onions and green peppers... The one good thing about this place was the wait time. 10 minutes for a party of four on a Sunday morning.",

Not so EGGsellent: -Ordered a skillet and it didn't really have the \"bacon and onion\" in it ... it was all potatos and eggs. -The potatoes are not good.  They are the little cube kind, and they are just meh tasting.  Considering the potatoes take up the bulk of the portion ... this is the main factor that kept me from a 4 star review. -Eggstremely slow service when paying.  There was literally a line out the door to give payment. -off the strip -Kinda pricey.  Total was $24 for 2 people.  Overall, it wasn't bad.  It didn't live up to the hype.

Portions are my pet peeve, and these were perfect, BIG.  The muffin they make is really good, and yhe ambiance is perfect for your morning, even a train running around the edge of the ceilingl A.

When we got there it looked like it was a pretty popular place, our wait was about 30-minutes but we ended up getting seated within 15-20 minutes.  Our waitresses were very friendly. Made good recommendations for everyone, and made frequent check ups on us.   The food was great!! I ordered the country fried steak. It was cooked just right, and the gravy was very flavorful.   Overall, very good experience, and I would definitely go back on my next trip to Vegas!! If you're not winning at the casinos, you'll definitely win at Egg & I!!",

I have dined here for over 10 years and the decor hasn't changed. The inside looks like a country barn. If you like that kind of thing, you'll like the Egg and I. Country music plays throughout.  Menu - The menu is extensive with about everything a breakfast diner could want. Dozens of egg combos prepared every which way. Waffles, crepes, burritos, pancakes. And choice of many sides too.  Coffee is average. I am an espresso snob so perhaps their coffee is A-OK for most.  Not fancy or touristy but honest, good food.  Stop on in.",

I ordered the chicken and chorizo hash plate, which was amazing btw.

Killer home fries with some kind of chili/onion powder that came w/ my two eggs.  I felt our waitress was a little pushy, but she was just doin' her job.  All I wanted was the two eggs that came with potatoes.  She kept asking if I wanted sausage, or bacon.   Choice of English muffin or the 'to die for' banana nut muffin.

There were six of us and we took two cabs from the Wynn...somehow our cab drivers got lost and it was a complete mess to get there...it ended up costing us $50 in cab fare to get there but once we did it was so worth it.  (The actual price of a cab not lost from the strip is about $12) We were seated in 15 minutes of arriving....and our server was sweet and good. I love anyplace that brings you not just a cup of coffee but a whole carafe....let me start off by saying I am not a breakfast eater but others in my group LOVES breakfast.   I ordered the oatmeal which was oatmeal and it came with milk and brown sugar. I also ordered a side of bacon which was perfectly done. My husband had the waffles which were huge and came with strawberries and whipped cream, eggs and bacon it was really good. I tasted from everyone's respective egg plates and they were all amazing. I believe there was a Vegetable Skillet and a Little Piggy at the table and those were divine. There were two fruit plates that came with cantalope, blueberries, strawberries and some other fruits. The ranch potatoes were amazing just the right mix of crispy and soft....I wish that I liked breakfast...one of my friends said that the pancakes here were the best she has ever had and she is a bit of a pancake snob. The portions were huge and the prices were right. You cannot go wrong with hitting up the Egg and I if you are into breakfast or with a bunch of people who are into breakfast. They also had other menu items available...burgers, salads, sandwiches. On my next trip to Vegas I will be sure to head off the strip for some of this eggy goodness!!",

My cousin was super excited because she had seen it on Rachel Ray.  I've never watched Rachel Ray, but if this is the kind of place she recommends, then I cannot trust her opinion.  This was another one of those \"it's more about saying you've been there, rather than the food\" type of places.  A lot of things on the menu sounded great.    got the Chicken Enchilada Omelet.  It was ok. I forgot what my girlfriend ordered, but it sounded fantastic on the menu.  It was ok. My friend ordered pork chops and eggs.  Looked great.  He said it was ok. My cousin and her hubby ordered whatever it was that Rachel Ray had ordered.  She was spouting off about how great it was, but honestly, it didn't even look that good.  Her enthusiasm seemed forced. The other members of our party weren't very pleased with their breakfasts either.  This place is only open until 2 pm.  So you better get there early.  Don't worry about me holding up your table though, because I won't be back.  I'll be at Blueberry Hill, on Flamingo Rd., enjoying a very good breakfast for about half the price.",

It is very convenient. :) I think the dishes are a bit pricey and so I ordered the side dishes in the back of the menu such as the bagel with sour cream, ranch potatoes, and two eggs! The atmosphere in the place is lively and comfy. The servers seem friendly and the music in the background is decent. After finishing my food, I thought the bagel was okay, I could find better at Winco! :P The ranch potatoes did indeed taste like ranch, but I am not a fan of it! Also the eggs were fine! I just love eggs. Overall the taste of the food was just okay. Nothing spectacular about the place.",

The banana nut muffin is an option to come with your meal instead of toast and I encourage you to take this offer because it is a sweet, dark, moist muffin that leaves you speechless.

I tend to go to this location more often though, and recently, it was the first time I had brought my husband and dogs with me.  Our server fussed over our pups and brought them water so major bonus points for that. She also made sure we had patio heater nearby. Even though there was only one other occupied table outside, we were still checked on frequently.  I had a lovely vegetarian omelette, but I was really crazed over my banana nut muffin. It was better than I remember, and it was actually steaming in the cold weather. I felt bad for all the yum noises I was making because my husband is gluten free. Speaking of which, when the waitress asked what bread he wanted on the side, he said none, and she offered to bring him a side of fruit. He was very appreciative. My husband declared his corned beef hash to be the best he's ever had, and he might have gotten a second order if he didn't have part of my meal to finish off.  The Egg & I will continue to be a \"must-visit\" when we come to Vegas.",

I went in to place my name on the list and went for first available meaning we might be seated outside. It looked okay since they had mists going on and it was pretty shaded. My brother didn't think it was a good idea so I went back and they had no problem noting we wanted to sit inside. It's busy but people go in and out quick. We waited for about 5-10mins.  As usual we got seated, got menus and they asked for what drinks we wanted. So far so good with service with Amanda. She took our orders and talked a little to my 1 1/2 year old niece. Drinks came out quick. The banana nut muffin that came with our meal came out as well and it was so delish!!! My daughter and I got one each and we saved one for later. We didn't want to get full so we shared one.  Our food came out. I had the corn beef hash with the side of potatoes. Potatoes were good. I don't know why I got the corn beef. I'm not really a fan of it but it got a lot of reviews. My daughter ate half of her omelette and saw a hair in it. We bothered one of the servers about it and she took it back and made my daughter a half order of the same omelette. Almost done with our meal, they forgot to t bring out the banana pancakes my bro ordered. We reminded them about it too.  The lady that took back the omelette came out with a complimentary plate of these banana bread with custard filling goodness. She probably gave it to us because of my daughters omelette and forgetting the pancakes on time. Omg! It melts in your mouth!!  I love this place and they have the best customer service. Especially when it's crazy busy in there. When they brought out the pancakes, they told us they did not charge us for the omelette and pancakes. How awesome is that??  They're super nice! Thank you Amanda! I'll definitely go back but not order the corn hash for me.",

Enough for you to take back home unless you are coping with a hangover and need all the carbs you can get.   The Banana Nut Muffin is really as good as everyone says it is; especially with the spread. You can tell they bake it fresh as there is no complex presentation to it. It is just simply muffin off the pan. I ordered the egg-ceptional omelette and it was decent. Definitely worth the money but, not mind blowing. I would try their other items if I go again. My friend got the stuffed french toast and that looked very good. However, the ranch potato side were delicious and exactly what I needed after a long weekend in Vegas.   Their high selling point is their super nice staff. They give you the perfect amount of chit chat and leave you alone time.  Use their egg signs. Yellow Egg means you need attention; Black Egg means leave me alone.",

My dining experience was nothing short of amazing by Perry. He was very patient and willing to help me choose the best plate on the menu that suited me. I chose to go with The Classic. First, Perry brought me out this FRESHLY BAKED, OUT OF THE OVEN Banana Nut Muffin. By far, the best muffin you could taste at such a great establishment. Also the entree plate was huge when Perry brought it out to me. I ate every bite and Perry smiled at me asking if I enjoyed my meal.  If you have read this far, hopefully you are waiting for your food. You won't be disappointed!",

It gets SO crowded and busy on the strip for breakfast/brunch whenever I've visited, and it makes people even hungrier and grumpier while waiting. My advice? Take a cab or drive over to this place for a REALLY tasty meal.  My group and I of five people waited about 10 minutes for a table. Once seated, we were serviced immediately. Food only took about 10 minutes to be ready, and the staff were very attentive and worked together to address our table's needs. They have a little egg sign that you can flip to the sad-face yellow side, which indicates that you're in need of something. We did this a couple times to test it out, and it worked! Lightning fast.  Great food, great service. I recommend the Biscuits and Gravy! The Ranch Potatoes (their regular side of potatoes) are very flavorful and filling. A must have. Oh, and their Banana Nut Muffin was soooo sweet and moist!  I just may be back when I'm in town. If I can get outta bed next time after a long night, that is. Tehe.",

Tammy outdid herself and made sure we were always taken care of even though our table was in the forgotten area of the outside.

It came w 2 eggs, ranch potatoes & the best banana nut muffin.  Omg, it wuz 2 die 4!!! That wuz yummy!!!  The place gets busy so try 2 come early.  Located off the strip.  I love breakfast places like this!!!",

But the best part of this place was the service! Even though the place was packed and there were plenty of people waiting in line, the turnover time is amazing, waited probably 15-20 minutes before getting our table with about 6 parties ahead of us. You're then greeted by the staff members who just make you feel good and welcomed, they're all smiles and super friendly! Our server in particular, Karla, was super helpful and welcoming. She made sure we had everything we needed and that we were enjoying our meal despite being busy tending to other tables as well. I would definitely come again, great people, great atmosphere, great food!",

    "text": "A groupon and good reviews lead me to try this place in Vegas. Normally, I do not go off the strip to eat. I don't think this place is as good as the reviews lead it to be... the place was packed when I went though, around 11am. It took about 30 minutes or so for a table. Looking at the menu, LOTS of stuff looked good and I had trouble deciding what to eat. The menu is a newpaper, which is actually really cute and different; also, there is a lot of word-play on the menu which I thought was cleaver. I ended up getting the chicken fried steak skillet and my brother got the carnitas skillet. Both did taste good, but I did not think it was spectacular. Portions were a good size, a bit larger than average. My chicken steak was tender and crispy and the gravy was good... but the house potatoes it came with was way too salty. I mixed everything together to try to lessen the salt taste, but in the end, I couldn't finish all the potatoes because, well, it was just too much salt. I think they need to put less of the seasoned salt on it. I'm a total potato lover and I couldn't finish my potatoes. My skillet also came with 2 eggs, anyway you want and a muffin or toast. I chose the muffin. It was good-average. I tried a bit of the carnitas skillet... but I'm not a big Mexican food fan... so it wasn't to my liking really, but my brother liked it. His did not come with a muffin or toast though. I also ordered coffee, thinking it was going to come in the interesting cup I see posted... it came in the ugly typical diner coffee cup...  Personally, I think Hash House A Go-Go has much better food and better prices... and way bigger portions!! My brother agrees with me too.   I don't think this place is worth the wait... it didn't stand out in my mind. Just an average breakfast place. Prices are fair... my chicken fried skillet was $10.50 and the carnitas skillet was about $11.   Go to Hash House A Go-Go if you want special yummy breakfast food... this place is just average.",

I ordered the country fried steak and the whole meal was crazy filling and satisfied my American breakfast cravings. It even comes with another muffin! She got the eggs Benedict and the one bite she allowed me to have made my mouth explode with heart felt desire for more. I'll deffinately be back to this spot during my next visit to Vegas.",

I can't remember the name... The potatoes were yummy.  Good price.. It got a bit crowded and it was very difficult to stand in line to pay at the register when all the parties waiting to be seated were standing right there.. Some old man even cut in front of us.. I guess he thought we were waiting to be seated.  By the time we left it was packed! Did I mention it was a Monday!?!  Will Definitely be back when in Vegas, I enjoyed the food and everyone was super friendly..  I'll try it a bit earlier with less of a crowd next time",

Pretty busy for a Monday morning. Were seated within 2 minutes, great. Server was friendly and attentive. Wife had the strawberry cream cheese stuffed french toast...yummy. Very good with a nice sized portion.  I had the corned beef hash. Good stuff, also a nice sized portion. I love corned beef hash and this was homemade. Excellent. Hit the spot. Great food, good service, reasonable prices. I was not too fond of the location ( I felt it was a bit far) but I wanted to avoid the strip so I guess I shouldn't complain.  The only CON for me was the lack of info on the server's part. I love pancakes, and always have them for breakfast when I dine out. I asked for pancakes instead of toast and was told they could not do that. Okay, no biggie. Not the first place that does this. However, the pancakes were HUGE and 3 came with the order. I barely even touched them because I was almost full from the hash. I was pretty upset that I dropped $6.25 for an order of pancakes that I had less than 1/4 of because of the shear size. I feel the server could've let me know they were huge and given me an option. Service is a big part of the experience when dining out. If I wouldn't have dropped $6.25 on uneaten pancakes our server would've gotten a nicer tip.",

And Of course, it wasn't hard to choose, \"toast or banana nut muffin\".. Is this a trick question? haha, banana nut muffin, please! Muffin was Awesome just not as warm and moist as the first time. There were many more customers dining this day and maybe they were a little busy and in a rush making them?   Chicken Fried Steak: Nice portion with a good amount of gravy, I went with egg whites only and their seasoned potatoes. The steak had the right crunchy skin, meat was perfect and their sausage gravy was mild and heart warming. In my opinion, much better dish than their corned beef hash.

Well, if you choose one place to experience, the Egg&I should be it.  This restaurant, provides great service and food.  The servers are knowledgable of their menu.  The food is deliciously prepared and served.  The busier times you will have provide your name to the host stand, the wait has been only fifteen minutes.  And if  your server asks your bread choice, ask for the Banana bread.",

They didn't have the same menu items as they do in CO but everything was just as good. I ordered a breakfast skillet with potatoes and chili. The skillet was very good, I loved it. My wife had the breakfast burrito and she also loved it. The potatoes are seasoned with paprika and other ingredients and are very good, but I prefer the CO potatoes. The only thing that I didn't like about this place is that they don't use the egg and I brand hot sauce.",

I opted for the open-faced croissant sandwich it was loaded with cheese bacon and four large eggs even came with a side of Diablo season home fries that were really good and crispy you could even buy that seasoning to take home with you so if you're in the area and you want a breakfast to fill you up for the whole day I highly highly recommend that you drive to this location you won't be disappointed",

(I was staying at Vdara). So I yelped Egg and I, and ventured off the strip with my rental car and my husband. My husband of course was a bit hesitant to venture off the strip, but he was SO happy I found Egg and I. (We ate here every morning of our 3 day stay). It was seriously that good.  We ordered- breakfast burrito (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ chicken fried steak: A (better to get sauce on side IMO) chicken omelet (it had a \"special\" name to it) A+ Denver omelet (ordered with egg whites and light cheese) A+ whole wheat pancakes (HUGE ORDER!) A+ Portions are big, so don't order too much!  Service was great! We had the same server all 3 days. She was surprised to see us back on the 2nd day, but was just laughing when she saw us the 3rd day. A bit funny I know :) She made sure our visit was pleasant, asking if we needing anything. The only thing I needed was help walking out their door, since I ate so much.   I hope Egg and I continues to serve great food. Sadly we don't live in Vegas, so we can only visit when we need to sunbathe and gamble :) So that's twice a year, hopefully more!  Thanks Egg & I, for a 5 STAR experience.",

I also love their newspaper-like menus, very creative.    It is a comfortable atmosphere and friendly service.  This is a popular restaurant, and we went on a Saturday morning, thus we had to wait for about 15 minutes for a table, which isn't bad at all. It took a while for us to decide on what to order because everything (they had quite a variety of choices on the menu) sounded so appetizing.  After we finally ordered, our food came out quickly, and everyone was pleased w/ each of our orders.  Everything looked very good and tasted great too.      It's not located that far away from the Vegas Strip, and it's definitely worth the short drive.  It's also a nice getaway from the chaos and traffic where the casinos are.  I certainly couldn't have gotten a decent and fairly priced breakbreast/brunch meal somewhere on the Strip. From now on, whenever I visit Vegas, I'll have to goeat at Egg and I.",

Only thing that sucks is that the cashier takes a while to ring up your stuff. She is pretty slow.

So I trusted fellow yelpers and hopped over here.  It was approaching noon, but I still had my heart set on breakfast.    We were seated quickly.  The service was ok. I don't know in what order the food went in or what, but this is what I noticed.   There were 2 tables in front of my view.  One table got seated 5 minutes after us and the other table seemed like they were wating forever for their food.  I'm assuming the manager, went up to the table and apologized for their food not getting there yet.  I then noticed the table who sat down 5 mintues AFTER us got served their food first.  I looked at the hubby and said, \"how did that happen?\" AND they were served way BEFORE the table that was waiting.  So something happened to communication from the servers and the kitchen.     I got the chicken fried steak.  When we got our food I was lovin' the potatoes!!  My scramble eggs were over cooked and hard - really no flavor.  My chicken fried steak was good, but the put sooo much gravy, I had to take half of it off.     Overall, the place is a good spot for breakfast in Vegas.  I wish I could get more of those damyn potatoes!! :)",

We all got different things off of the menu and liked everything we had. Lisa was our waitress- she was very friendly, and very efficient.  We will definitely stop here again when we visit vegas!",

She was extremely personable and helpful .My  husband and I always share because the portions are very generous. But we always have to compromise because we each want something different. Ashley informed us about the dishes that we can get half portions of. So now there is no need to share. We can each get what we want. Everything on the menu is great. So be adventurous and  try something different.",

We did have a wait for about 40 minutes upon arrival as well. A local favorite. Combine tourists like us with locals, you got a busy place! Look in the 24/7 guide for a buy 1, get 1 entree free coupon. The banana nut muffin is served warm and is a must eat. We both got omelets - love the unique variety! The homestyle potatoes are super tasty and you get a generous portion. Fresh squeezed orange juice - a plus! The little black/yellow egg flipper as a service indicator is fun and helpful. Within seconds of flipping it to the black egg (meaning we needed service) the MANAGER was over at our table asking what we needed and joking with us. Everyone here is friendly, upbeat and happy you stopped in. Good place, good people. Go.",

Lots of cool touches like the newspaper style menus and the little flipcharts to let the server know you need something.  The breakfast skillets are superb here, served hot on the skillet with a layer of ranch potatoes.  I have tried both the Chili skillet and the Ultimate skillet, both were excellent.  I also recommend the banana nut muffin side.  I would, however, advise against ordering from their Mexican inspired menu.  They should definitely leave the chorizo con huevos to the Mexican joints.  Overall one of my favorite Vegas dining spots, for breakfast or a late night snack (they are open til 3AM).",

We found this place from one of those Vegas pamphlets they hand out with a 2 for 1 coupon in it.   And by the looks of all the other reviews, I would say that everyone knows about this place too. It was packed when we showed up.   I got the corn beef hash with two eggs over easy and their banana nut muffin. The corn beef was fresh and their banana nut muffin was really good! Now I see shy they were famous for them. The ranch potatoes were a little too salty for my taste. They need to tone it down on the salt and then they would be really good but really didn't eat them  because I felt my blood pressure go through the roof! lol..  My BF had the Chicken omelet and he gave me a bite and it was really de-lish especially if you are an avocado freak because there was a ton of avocado stuffed in the omelet.   The service was really good even for sitting out on the patio. I would definitely go back for breakfast when I come back into town!",

My waitress Amanda was there immediately to see if I had any questions and to take my drink order. She has a warm smile and made me feel very welcome. I ordered the Texas toast French toast with eggs and bacon. It was delicious. I also ordered a side of toast for which she asked if I wanted it buttered which usually they don't so that was great. The eggs were perfectly over medium and they were actually seasoned. Amanda was very attentive and was sure that I was not in need of anything. I also had the banana nut muffin it was one of the best I've had in a restaurant, I am a bit partial to my own.  I will say the service through out was exceptional from the moment I walked in until I left even thought the register had trouble reading the card I had.   The food would definitely be worth the wait, and the service I experienced was above expectations for how busy the are. Give it a try if you haven't been",

We were seated rather quickly (about 20 min) considering how many parties were ahead of us (about 8) Be prepared to be put in a food coma... I had the sunrise omelet with chicken and could only finish half of it. The thing I liked about the omelet was that it wasn't too oily like in other omelettes I've had. Cheese was a little too much for me as well. My friend and I split the strawberry cream cheese French toast. If you don't mind having gobs of strawberry jelly and whip cream on your French toast, this is definitely for you! The taste was spot on, but can be overwhelmingly goopy for some. Overall, good food, good service. You definitely could feed a small family with just a couple of entrees!",

The chili is normally had over spaghetti with mounds of cheese and for those of you that have no one to maks out with,  get it with onions and beans.  Yummy!  During this trip I decided to go low carb and get the chili over an omelette and of course bacon.  Most of the dishes here come with theIr seasoned country fries.  They are delicious.   Since I'm a fry connoisseur,  I can really appreciate these delicious cubed and fried pieces of carbs.",

They are not bad but not super good neither, just your normal above average brunch foods. Price is good for Vegas. Our bill came to about $100 for 7 people.

Had put in our name for the full 8 people but two were running about 5 minutes late. They wouldn't seat us until they showed...(even so the others could get coffee/take a look at the menu).

We must have hit the right time of morning because the place was jammed by the time we left. Well worth any wait.   Food - The menu was expansive. So many items to choose from. I had the Three Pig Omelette with a side of their excellent hollandaise sauce. Superb. My son was pleased with his waffle. My wife, who is not a huge breakfast fan, was thrilled to see she could get an egg white omelette. She commented that you never really know how egg white dishes will turn out. She raved about her egg white veggie omelette. The two others in our party had the the biscuits and gravy and loco moco respectively. The biscuits and gravy were a hit while the loco moco was remarkably reminiscent to the Hawaiian Islands favorite dish.   Service - The service was exceptional. In an industry where service can significantly impact the diner's experience, Oscar was fantastic. Oscar was well versed in his menu knowledge and was quick to offer recommendations and to gladly accept order substitutions. His pleasant, respectful, and appreciative demeanor really helped to set our dining experience apart from every other experience while in town. He was also aware and kind enough to notice the kitchen was getting backed up so he brought out a plateful of banana nut muffins to help stunt the growing hunger we all were suffering.   Overall - Highly recommend this restaurant for the wonderful combination of great food and top-notch service.",

At 1 pm on a Saturday, we barely waited 10 minutes. Our server took our orders quickly, and gave everyone a banana nut muffin on the house!  A couple of my friends and I split the blackened prime rib benedict (a must must MUST!), the strawberry cream-stuffed french toast (tasted like fair food), and an Italian omelette. Enormous portions priced right--felt so bad leaving so much of it uneaten, especially since it was so delish. Even the coffee was the absolute perfect diner coffee.  I don't think I can ever do a Vegas trip without the Egg & I. It's so worth the drive off the strip! And believe the hype--just stick to the blackened prime rib benny and you won't be disappointed.",

So we walk in and request an outside table and were seated in a timely manner. The hostess seated us that had the tip still on the table and I thought that maybe she didn't see so I let her know oh the tip is still on the table and she had a bit of an attitude while telling me the server would grab it. The server, Amanda, came over to us and greeted us and we told her what happened. I wasn't that upset but I just thought it was kind of ridiculous. Anyways our server was really great! Bubbly and cute and super friendly. She even sent the manager over after we had told her about the tip thing and they gave us a free round of muffins! I love that! I guess it's company policy they leave the tip on the table due to bussers stealing tips.   So on to the food. I got what I always do, it's just a platter with potatoes sausage toast and eggs and it's always delicious. My brother got banana but French toast and Biola got regular French toast and it was fricking fantastic.    Once again I'd just like to say how amazing our server was! Thanks Amanda! Also I hope you win that trip to Disneyland!",

I usually let my dissatisfaction be known in the tip I leave, although when the waiter came over and asked if I was ready to order I did comment that I had \"been\" ready a while now. I ordered a breakfast burrito, which comes with seasoned potatoes. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and it tasted good. I noticed that as I was leaving, the place was really crowded.  The menu here is vast, from scrambled eggs to breakfast burritos. The food here is tasty and plentiful. The service for me at least, is hit and miss.",

After 30 years of practice they clearly have a grasp on what it takes to run a well buttered breakfast machine.   The options available are almost endless with a lot of interesting dishes to choose from. The food was well proportioned and was an incredible value. Eggs of course were perfectly cooked and dishes seasoned well.   Staff is always happy and helpful which clearly indicates to me good management of the restaurant.   Overall it's an eggsellent place to go anytime your in the mood for breakfast or brunch!",

The restaurant is pretty large so it was great for our group of 10.  +BACON & SLICED AVOCADO OMELETTE: This is a gigantic portion, which makes sense because it's made with four large eggs. While the potatoes are really delicious, I opted to switch it out with cottage cheese (weird, I know). I just knew the potatoes would be way too heavy for me along with the bread, which comes pre-buttered! Tastes delicious with the various jams already at the table.   +BANANA MUFFIN: Check in so you get the free, super tasty muffin. It's delicious and moist. (Maybe not for people who don't like the banana flavors.)  The service here is incredibly friendly. With a group of 10, it can get kinda hectic and things can be forgotten, but that didn't seem to be the case. We also were easily able to ask for more muffins (because deliciousness). There's also this egg flipping signage to let the staff know if you need anything. We didn't put this to use and they checked in on us anyway.  All in all, Egg & I is such a great brunch place with delicious food in great quantities. Love the atmosphere!",

Funny thing to say when speaking about a location that has something to offer for everyone and a few of the best dining experiences that money can buy.   The Egg & I is simply a great place to enjoy breakfast and that's because it is simple.  Everyone who knows me knows that I love breakfast and can almost always be found at my favorite breakfast place in Corona, CA every Saturday morning without fail.  The Egg & I is a place that locals visit and has a lot of regulars.  It's located in a small strip mall that is way off the strip.    The interior is what you would expect in a diner that intended for locals.  It's a large open space with lots of tables and country-ish decorations on the walls  The menu is consists of many different egg dishes, pancakes, waffles and some incredible looking skillets.  On my first visit I tried the Works Omelet, which as you would expect has a list of ingredients including bacon, sausage, ham, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, cheese and sour cream.  It is served with Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes and a choice of toast or a house made banana nut muffin.      The omelet was cooked to perfection.  It was served hot, light and fluffy. The cacophony of ingredients came together to form the perfect symphony of deliciousness.   My preference for breakfast potatoes is hash browns.  I love them!  The Habla Diablo potatoes were a treat and a nice departure from the hash brown rut I'd been in.  The high point of the meal was however was the banana nut muffin(s).   They serve one almost like an appetizer when sit down before you order.  You get a free one with a Yelp check in.   It told our waitress, Chance (awesome Las Vegas name) how much I liked them and she sent me home with a couple of extra.  Bless her!  I'm not a huge fan of bananas.  In fact I hate everything about them but the banana nut muffins here changed my mind.  It's worth a trip to Egg & I just for muffins.  To summarize, great food, fun local ambience, extremely friendly staff.  I'd repeat and repeat and repeat and repeat...",

There are only 2-3 stalls available and considering how packed this place gets, it's not adequate. I was 4th in line for the bathroom and was so close to using that Men's restroom.

It's great and the menu is HUGE. I enjoyed a veggie omelet while my buddy had French toast stuffed with eggs and cheese. Told you you'd be beating that hangover. The home fries are top notch as well.  I love the table system of alerting the wait staff when you need something. There's a smily face at your table that you simply turn to the frowny side. What a good idea.  Needless to say, I loved it here. I now have a new breakfast spot for my Vegas weekends.",

It had over 1,100 reviews and nearly a 5 star rating.  Obviously, I had to try it.  My companions were a bit skeptical upon arriving.  However, after my first visit, I was thoroughly impressed.  The waitress and staff were very attentive.  And the food?  It was incredible!  I got the Bacon and Sliced Avocado omelet with fruit, one companion got the Crazy Chicken omelet and another got the Sunrise Mountain.  The amount of avocado in our omelets was awesome.  My one companion complained to me that it was too much avocado, but she's nuts.  There is no such thing as too much avocado.  And my other companion, loved, loved, loved the Sunrise Mountain so much that he got it the 2nd morning were went.  Yes, that's right, we went 2 mornings in a row.  My 2nd morning, I got the Chili Rellenos omelet (which was more amazing than the bacon one [I know!]), and my other companion got the Seasoned Center Cut NY Steak.  And again, it was incredible!  And the staff again exceeded our expectations.  The manager (sorry, I cant remember her name, but she's curly haired, blonde and very beautiful...hey, I was enthralled with food in front of me, but she's amazing! EDIT: her name is Abby...yes, I did go back this morning) brought out the steak and asked my companion to cut into it to see if was to her doneness preference because other steaks were coming out a little rarer than preferred.  Upon doing so, and finding it was in fact a little too rare, it was gladly taken back and finished to perfection.    All this to say that I am preparing myself to go the gym to work up a monster appetite so that we can go this morning for the third day in a row and enjoy another EGGMAZING (sorry, couldn't help myself) breakfast! God, I wish this place was in NJ.  FYI, I took a menu with their knowledge and explained to them that I am going try and replicate for my own personal satisfaction.",

Located about two miles passed Palace Station casino off Sahara Ave, The Egg & I is a wonderful breakfast/brunch place that is continuously packed. The service is quick, efficient and friendly. Our server Perry was right there ready to take our orders and food arrived shortly afterwards.   We had the prime rib benny, grandma's biscuits and gravy, corned beef hash and Island Favorite. Everything was delicious but I found the benny to be a bit salty for my preference....the banana nut muffin was sooo good and moist. I highly recommend this place and will be back here the next time I come to Vegas.",

We tried to claim the free banana nut muffin when we checked in on yelp, but they did not honor the offer.  The cashier lady made up excuses and said since we ordered our food with muffin (which it should come with toast or muffin) we don't get an extra one with the check-in and that we should save the yelp check in for next time.  Checking in on yelp is one thing and ordering our food that come with an option of toast and muffin is another thing since that is part of the meal that I pay for.  The principle just make no sense. Minus 1 star for not honoring  the yelp Check-in. That could have completed our experience.",

I even got a sweat shirt from here that I wear regularly to the gym in NY LOL. Cute shirt just like the logo. Hubby said that you need your ID to pay at the cashier (if you use your card). The service is one of the best in Vegas. They're fast without rushing you, courteous without over do it, polite and happy naturally. Never had one bad experience. Everything on the menu comes with eggs, what do you expect at \"Egg & I\"? They come with eggs but not with \"U\" of course, we don't eat people. The potato is amazing! I don't like potato but I like this type. It's diced-potato with tasty spice or could be just salt but very tasty. I don't eat much salt but I don't feel that it's salty, just tasty. I've tried different types of omelettes here and thought they're pretty big. Of all the omelette that I ordered so far, I liked Works Vege Omelette and Traditional Omelette. Not a big fan of Chili omelette. Last visit I had just the classic 2 Sunnyside up with toasted English muffin. Had something like this with multigrain before and fruit plate but this time I had it with cottage cheese. Hubby had eggs with potato but usually he would order it with bacon or ham too but I begged hubby to get something without meat for breakfast this time. Whatever you order here is great. I've tried many and highly recommended! Coffee is ok not so much on the \"wow\" side but they give you a pot for a table, so drink up your caffeine and then go play and win a jackpot!",

I normally get the classic eggs (with cheddar jack cheese), bacon (it's crispy!), their country potatoes, and 9 grain toast. If I don't order that then I order their parfait. I know, parfait sounds lame but their parfait comes in a big old school milkshake glass with yogurt, granola, and a mix of fresh fruits. I actually couldn't even finish it last time.   This place is packed on the weekends and they do not take reservations.   They always have a deal a Groupon, it's worth it!",

Without our love and faith in Yelp, we never would have found this place.  Nearly every table was filled on a Monday morning. Our servers name was Debra and she was prompt, friendly and very knowledgable  about the menu items.   The menu is pretty extensive. They do just about anything you can imagine with an egg. I ordered the bacon and avo omelette and my husband had the chile relleno omelette. We ordered a side of Diabla sauce, which came warm and was the perfect compliment. Our omelettes were moist, perfectly cooked, and stuffed with fresh ingredients. The potatoes at Egg and I were nothing short of addictive. It took what little will power I had on our last morning in Vegas to push away from my plate.  We will come here for breakfast every time we are in Vegas now.",

The potatoes were both crispy and salty underneath a perfect combo of eggs, bacon, and onion. Each bite was perfect. It came with a choice of toast or muffin. I got the muffin and my daughter ordered toast so we could have both. The muffin was fluffy and soft. They served it warm so the butter became soft when it was spread on it.  One of the things I liked is that they left the carafe of coffee on the table so you can serve yourself and not have to wait for the wait staff to fill it again when it got empty. I would definitely come back if I visit again.  Some of the choices I was not brave enough to try like the mashed potato omelet.",

Our lil one had (with their check in) one free banana nut muffin side of avocado and some of our papas and she enjoyed everything as well! Wish their was a downtown location!

We arrived and the line was out the door at 11:30am on a Saturday morning...granted it was St. Paddy's Day weekend, but I think it would have been just as long any other time.  We waited for a table for about 15 minutes. Not bad considering the line. Once seated, I checked into Egg & I, and I got a free Banana Nut Muffin. OMG!!!!!  THE BEST BANANA NUT MUFFIN EVER!  And that was just the beginning of our glorious dining experience.  Let's talk about Victoria. She's dynamite. You'll want her to be your bestie just as we all did.  She is so personable and friendly and funny and I could go on and on. She was so attentive, our glasses were never empty...even the Bloodies! She gave us her recommendations and we were NOT disappointed.   Between us, we had omelettes, stuffed french toast, waffle w/banana, coconut and toffee and a mexican skillet. As I said before, we were not disappointed.   If this place came to California, we would definitely make the trek wherever it lands. I HIGHLY recommend Egg and I...and their BANANA NUT MUFFIN!  Thank you Victoria for being our bestie even if it was only for 30 minutes!   We will be back!!!",

There are not a lot of fatty oils used so even if you pig out you won't feel to weighed down. The muffin that is served before your meal arrives is absolutely amazing. The coffee is pretty plain and is really the only thing that could have been better. With that being said, it was a diner so the coffee was on par for what I expected. The service was really good. I like that there is a sign that you can flip up for when you need service. It's nice not to be bothered every couple of minutes. Look for the waitresses wearing a button on their uniform declaring that the owner was right! (sorry, I forgot his name) As the story goes, when a server leaves egg and I to go work somewhere else he tells them they will be back. When they come back they have to wear the button! Lol",

It is their very famous and tasty treat. If you check in w/ Yelp you can also get the muffin.   FOOD:  1. *Waffle Works Waffle w/ side of two eggs any style and any meat (i.e. ham, bacon, sausage)  2. Fiesta Skillet Eggs any style with cheddar and jack cheese and a side home-fries  3. Veggie Skillet Eggs any style with cheddar and jack cheese with spinach and green peppers  4. Pancakes Choose a type of batter (i.e. buttermilk, whole wheat, homemade) and amount of pancakes (2-3) and flavor (i.e. plain, blueberry, chocolate chip)  Overall all the food was great. Except the home-fries were a little salty with a little heat. Also, the portions can be pretty large, so you can definitely share. But either way good brunch place to come with family. Definitely give it a go.",

I didn't think it was going to be good but boy was i wrong!  It's located off the strip and driving past it i honestly would not have given it a second look. We saw the reviews and they were good.   The place had a nice crowd. We were greeted and seated immediately.  Our waitress Tamara (who was helpful and awesome) suggested the Bandito Scramble. It had pepper jack, cheddar, sour cream, chorizo, jalapenos and of course eggs. It came with a spicy sauce on the side and breakfast potatoes. Oh my goodness, it was wonderful. Oh and it also came with an AMAZING banana nut muffin...pure perfection!  Another thing I liked on the menu that I didn't try was they had Cincinnati chili. I'm from Cincinnati and everybody knows chili is our thing. I'll be back before I leave to try it and get another banana nut muffin.  My husband did great finding this place!",

The location is also convenient to the airport if you need to catch a flight. It has a hometown feel and you feel like a local the moment you step inside the door. The menu is huge and there is something for everyone. The portions are huge and hard to finish, a great deal for their reasonable prices. Our favorite is the enchilada omelet. I've never had anything like it anywhere else. As soon as you place your order, ask for the banana nut muffin- AMAZING!! It's huge and warm, with a swipe of butter it is absolutely heavenly. Everything is cooked fresh to order. We enjoy sitting at the bar so we can watch the staff hustle around. The service is always quick and friendly! We always carve out time for breakfast here when we visit and we crave these omelets between trips.",

However you can choose any of these, ham, bacon or sausage. It also comes with a side of potatoes squares. They have large portions and vast selection of items on the menu. Almost everything has some kind of egg.   Drinks: started off with some hot tea, then had a corona :-)   Definitely try their signature Habla Diablo verde sauce with your food. Not too spicy, trust me.   There's parking right out front and this place is off the strip.   Their prices are very decent. Also make sure to check in to get your free muffin.",

When they forgot to bring out my friends muffin that was included in his meal, Oscar apologized and brought out a plate full of muffins so that we could all try :) really appreciated it !

I got the Flapper and my friend got one of the omelet with spinach, chicken, feta cheese, tomato, and bacon. Both were alright, except I think the omelet was a bit salty probably from the feta cheese. It's a good breakfast place I think. Their banana nut miffin is pretty good. I think it's the best banana nut muffin I ever had because it's sweet - maybe honey and brown sugar and soft and moist and warm when we got it, but also a bit oily. Taste like cake.",

Service is always nice and friendly without being overbearing.  I ordered the Blackened Prime Rib eggs Benedict with the home fries.  The eggs were poached perfectly and the Prime Rib was flavorful.  I love Hollandaise sauce, and while this is not the best out there, it was pretty decent.  The home fries were a little bland, but I do like the touch of adding some red bell peppers and spinach along with the prime rib.  It adds a nice bit of sweetness to the dish.  I'm sure I will be back again next year.",

We were seated right away, service was attentive and friendly, and prices were decent. The menu is vast, with all the traditional breakfast options as well as some unique ones like the \"crepelette\" an omelet/crepe hybrid. They offer dozens of lunch items too.  I had the \"Flapper\" breakfast platter ($8.95) which consists of 2 pancakes, 2 eggs, and 2 sausage (your choice of pork or turkey). The eggs were perfectly cooked (I like 'em over easy). Any place that offers a turkey sausage option is awesome for me as a non pork-eater. The real star of the plate was the pancakes. They were perfection! I am usually more of a french toast/waffle person so this was a gamble for me. The pancakes were piping hot, spongy yet fluffy in texture, and really flavorful! Served with a side of hot maple syrup too.  I would highly recommend Egg & I to anyone looking to get away from the Strip for an inexpensive and tasty breakfast.",

This place will fill your stomach and pleasure your taste buds. It's INSANE!!!!! We had the chile relleno omelette and holy ****, I felt like I was having a party in my mouth! I've never had anything like it! And the potatoes and homemade banana muffin seriously! Our server Alexa gave us the best service. She was very nice and attentive. Even the bus boy Jesus was on it. He came by at least 3 times to make sure that we were ok. I noticed he went around to a lot of the tables since the restaurant was so busy. Alexa and Jesus should tag team most of the tables. This place would be even busier! Loved this this place! Please open up in Southern California! God knows we could use some good breakfast! PS You can send Alexa and Jesus to open it up",

    "text": "To start off, this place has been on my list of stuff to try for a couple of months solely based on the name.. and after reading through the rave yelp reviews my expectations for the quality of food slowly started to grow.   I planned to head back to socal early this morning and wanted to be the first one in the restaurant. I arrived at around 5:45 am and fidgeted in my rental car while checking the \"closed sign.\" Suddenly another car pulled up next to me, the driver walked out and headed straight into the restaurant - the sign was magically on Open. Wtf...   The hostess/waitress was so friendly (and at the buttcrack of dawn thats pretty impressive) that I think this partly made me enjoy not only the food but much of the rest of my day.  The front lobby is decorated with articles and reviews AND pictures of eggs in action shots which I found pretty amusing (sometimes it doesnt take much) but the main eating area is pretty diner-y so I kind of zoned out till the food arrived. Ordered the fender bender egg crepe with avocado and sprouts and something else in it and it came out surrounded by a mountain of delicious seasoned potatoes and the softest, freshest muffin i've ever had. The egg crepe is in a league of its own compared with any kind of omelet you can get at IHOP or denny's or some drive by diner.   I sat there for a good half hour savoring the meal. At the end it was all gone - the muffin, potatoes, egg crepe and the bucket of coffee. For the amount of food I had, it was very very light and felt quite healthy. I didn't get hit by the food coma train on the way home which is a big plus.  As a heavy consumer of all things chicken, I recommend this place to everyone. Unless you don't have taste buds...then go to your local diner where your $4.99 omelet brings you to orgasm every sunday morning. If you have taste buds - go eat here. Pay a little extra. Its worth it. I would guess that this is the best \"cheap\" breakfast i've ever had.",

If you like salt, you would love this dish. The egg on top did help balance it out. I don't care for the country potatoes and should have gotten the hash browns. Fresh squeezed OJ with pulp, very refreshing. Service was surprisingly prompt for a pack house inside. Water was filled when needed.   On to the muffin - it's a winner, simply the best muffin i ever had and surprisingly with no salt added. It was banana nut but you wouldn't know by looking at it.  However, you can taste it. They should consider opening a muffin shop and just sell these as it would be a big seller imho. A 3.5 overall experience but I am rounding it up because of the tasty muffin and would come back again just for that.",

If you are unhappy you can switch it to the sad face but if you look around tables are pretty satisfied.   Food: 4 stars- food is decent but nothing special. Wide selection of almost any breakfast dish you can think of. Most dishes come with your choice of eggs and potatoes. They have seasoned potatoes and hashbrowns.  This is a great spot to catch a quick bite with friends. Easy to break up checks since you bring it to the front cashier.",

Food: 1) Banana Nut Muffin was the best I've ever tried so far. You could tell they used a lot of butter because it was so soft and flavorful! 2) Benedict - The eggs were poached perfectly and the hollandaise sauce was amazing. Perfect execution of this dish. 3) Ranch potatoes were FANTASTIC. They were seasoned perfectly and not overly salty. They didn't have that heavy, thick potato texture. It was lightly crispy on the outside and soft on the inside.  Service: The hostesses knew how to handle the influx of people waiting and the servers were friendly, helpful, and very efficient. We even got water refills without even having to ask.",

It tasted to us like your typical breakfast at a restaurant.

    "text": "Yes, being in Vegas you would think the best places to eat would be on the famous strip. However, I've found that the restaurants worth pilgrimaging to are actually on the outskirts of the strip! I can't help it, I like to eat like a local. Being a breakfast/brunch fanatic I figured I'd look to Yelp to find a breakfast spot with big portions that won't break the wallet! I found Egg & I as one of the best places to go to for brunch so I thought I'd give it a shot.   The ambiance has a small-town diner feel to it which I loved! The menu had way too many amazing options which made it difficult to decide what to eat. I chose to get the eggs benedict while the boyfriend had the country benny, both which were AMAZING! The portions were huge, the gravy is perfectly made, the banana nut muffin is to die for, and the staff is always friendly and pleasant. Now this is our \"go to\" brunch place to eat on Sundays before we make the long trek back to California. This place is a MUST!",

Beware the at their sausage patties are rather flavorless,  pre-fab frozen breakfast sandwich patties.  I had the vegi-benny breakfast with their breakfast potatos, ie deep fried potato nuggets. The Benny was very good. Their cinnamon roll was very good. Not 5 stats for having to wait way too long for coffee and for few healthy options. A last note about all the televisions they have mounted on the walls. We enjoyed watching COPS while dining. Really guys?   The fact that this place has long waits on weekends goes to show that Las Vegas needs better because even this greasy spoon with a homecooked image gets slammed.",

Service is great too. Our server, Thay, took our group pictures voluntarily and filled our glasses and coffee mugs frequently. Awesome food and service makes for a great experience.

The reality: not so good.  I had a benedict. I asked for the eggs medium hard, and they came out essentially hardboiled (I am not holding that against them), but worse, the hollandaise was pretty awful. Sort of an off, slightly grainy texture, no lemon to cut the richness, just unappetizing. Potatoes seemed too regular, like processed frozen potatoes.   On the upside, I tried one of the banana nut muffins, and it was pretty good. The staff was wonderful--really nice, helpful, on point.   If only the food had lived up to them.....",

So on the way back home today we stopped by for breakfast. The place looked as I remembered and we were promptly greeted and seated by a very friendly hostess. The menus are quite charming as they look like your local newspaper and there are many delicious options. I ended up ordering Grandma's Biscuits & Gravy with scrambled eggs, home fries, sausage patties and a banana nut muffin. The muffin was soft and warm; slather some butter and it was great. I really enjoyed the gravy on the biscuits and the home fries, where are very well seasoned. The rest of my party got a ham and bacon omelette with home fries and a blueberry muffin, along with a chicken salad sandwich on rye bread with cranberries and walnuts. All three of us ended up eating half the plates so we have some food to go with us on the 4 1/2 hour trip back home.  Overall, great food, nice service and reasonable prices. Will definitely make a return trip next time I'm in town!",

The menu options are EXTENSIVE. Lots of sweet and savory options. We ordered the Brad's Scramble and Waffle with a banana nut muffin on the side. I'd read tons of reviews about the muffin so I wanted to know what the hype was all about.   And I was BLOWN AWAY. This is one of the yummiest, tastiest muffins I've had in my life. And this set the bar really, really high for me.   Then the waffle - with a nice layer of whipped cream and blueberries was perfect.   Scrambled eggs were great as well. The potatoes were really excellent! Cooked perfectly and coated with the Hablo Diabla spice, not too spicy - just right.   When we went to settle the check, there was a mixup and they charged us with someone else's bill. But they handled the situation well, and fixed the goof up very humbly.   The staff was always nice and sweet.   This is in stark comparison to the fancier places we dined over the weekend, where the staff was very curt and hostile at best.   Will definitely come back, just for those muffins awww man.",

When we order she would ask additional questions like, would you like flavored creamers? And give additional recommendations towards the food choices.  2) Linnea would always check on us and see if we were doing good, always having a cheerful welcoming smile on her face and the way she talked made us feel very welcomed.  3) When there was a slight mistake, because my friend ordered steak and instead of eggs they wanted an omelet, which never happened before and Linnea brought out my stuff French toast and apologize for the confusion and mishap, that the steak was cooked inside the omelet and apologize for the confusion and wait... Which we didn't even wait long. About 3 minutes the steak and omelet was brought out immediately. Still apologizing... It didn't matter too much to us and for the fact that they were sincerely sorry. Wow what exceptional service.   4) I was going to stop at 3, but since Linnea went above, she not only brought us our check but a \"sorry\" gift of banana bread wrapped and gifted nicely. I was shocked to see such service!!!   THIS IS WHAT YOU CALL AMAZING SERVICE, someone who went above and does more than just servicing you! Thank you Linnea!!! We enjoyed our visit and defiantly will be coming back! I hope you will be in Disney by than!!! :D",

Try looking this place up on google so it will give you the times it's not as busy. That's what I do! The French toast with bacon- apple butter is absolutely amazing and would Quench the sweetest of tooth's. My girlfriend got the house potatoes and sunny side up eggs with a side of bacon, the potatoes are great only the eggs are pretty average. I'd say the service is above average our server was nice and helped us decide on our dishes based on our personal preferences. Over all our experience was four stars and only because of how busy the location was, we were unable to enjoy our conversation and the food completely. Go here and find out for yourself!",

He made sure he was always in the area to make sure we had everything we needed throughout our meal. He brought everything in a timely manner. He was very service oriented. He made our dining experience outstanding.  ...And the food is great too. The restaurant reminded me of a breakfast joint in Southern California. This place is way better! The food tasted SO good! The portions are enough. I checked in on Yelp and redeemed a voucher for a free banana nut muffin. It was moist and full of flavor.",

It came with a delicious side of home style potatoes which were seasoned perfectly and had a side of salsa, which also tasted amazing!  The other entree ordered at the table was the chicken enchilada omelette which was also delicious! So the food is a big part of dining out, but then there's service which we all know can make or break an experience ...  Amanda was incredible! She was polite, friendly, and fast without being pushy! She encouraged us to take our time and when we were not quite sure what to order she offered recommendations which we definitely took and did not regret! The cinnamon roll and banana muffin were also DELICIOUS!   An elderly impatient man sat himself behind us and after only a minute of being sat was incredibly rude and calling out for a waitress and coffee (despite not waiting to be sat by the hostesses). Amanda was calm and very polite when she greeted him which I can tell you, takes a lot when you aren't being treated with respect!   So with food and service being on point, I'd have to say this place is a hit and worth traveling off the strip for while in the area! I'll definitely be back and recommend it to friends! Thanks again staff and especially Amanda!",

It is a lot of food but we ate it all. I had no more room for my muffin so i took it to go. We loved the experience and would come back any day. This definitely a keeper in my book.",

I ordered the Fiesta Skillet which was a layer of their ranch potatoes topped with a mixture of green chilies, onions, and salsa.  On top of that was a layer of melted cheese and two eggs over-easy.  The skillet was accompanied by two slices of wheat toast and two slices of fruit.  It was pretty tasty.  I really like the ranch potatoes, eggs were cooked correctly, no brown spots and yolks were runny.  There were three different types of Habla Diablo sauce on the table Original, Chipotle, and Verde.  So if you need a little spice in your breakfast you can choose your pain.  Well not really since none of them are that spicy.    Overall  I enjoyed breakfast.  I have tried other items at their other locations they all taste good.  Would definitely be up there on the list of breakfast places to go.",

This place isn't very big and it gets crowded on weekends. We arrived at about 10:30 on a Saturday morning, but we only waited 15 minutes for a table. Our food came out faster and we were in and out in a little over an hour including great conversation. Before our food came to the table, our server, Stacy, introduced herself and brought us the delicious banana bread muffins with butter.  I ordered the eggs Benedict and some orange juice. The hollandaise sauce was creamy and not too thick. The eggs were perfectly poached. Together with the Canadian bacon, everything was well balanced. Sometimes, if the hollandaise sauce is over seasoned, the combination of the hollandaise with Canadian bacon leaves the dish too salty. That definitely wasn't the case here. Throughout our meal, Stacy was fantastic. She kept checking on us. At one point I needed an additional napkin and was about to flip the egg when the manager walked up to ask what we needed. Although Stacy did bring the check a little early, she apologized, ensured us that there was no rush and brought me the additional orange juice I wanted to order. When we were done, one of the other servers noticed my injury and offered to help me up. I really appreciated her concern. This place is great!",

I was offered the choice of toast or banana nut muffin. I went with traditional toast. The omelet is simply the best I've ever had. It had the perfect combination of spinach, artichoke hearts, tomatoes and topped with feta cheese. Brilliant  Now, to the matter of the toast. Fortunately, one of my companions ordered the banana nut muffin. Even more fortunate, she offered to share. Not an over powering banana taste, more of a whole grain taste, yet just nutty enough, with a hint of chocolate bitterness.   While I loved my experience, I can't give five stars, as some in my party were not as happy with their dishes as I was with mine. I do look forward to trying more from the menu very soon.",

I was recently introduced to the benny and can't believe what I've been missing out on. There are so many sensational flavors in this dish that you just have to try it for yourself!  And those potatoes - I'm not much of a potato breakfast person but could not help stealing these off my friend's plate!  - Strawberry stuffed french toast: I am more of a 'sweets' type of breakfast girl so I typically order french toast. You get 2 slices of toast stuffed with strawberry cream cheese goodness.  Unfortunately, this dish starts to become a little TOO sweet at the end so it's a struggle to finish the last few bites.  (I've had to confirm this by ordering this dish twice.)  If you can share this dish with someone, that'd work out well.  - banana bread muffins: you pretty much have to try this when you go there. I'm so confused because sometimes, I've been given the muffin for free and other times I've had to order it...but whatevs, you gotta do what you gotta do!  The muffin is soft and when served warm = bomb-dot-com.  ** ALSO, must note on the service. All the workers are very polite and friendly. If you ever need something, they have this egg face you can turn over at your table. When the egg is black, you're fine.  Need something? Then turn the egg over so it's yellow. I have to say, this system totally works. Because the few times we've need a coffee refill or something..flip over the egg face and *BAM* someone helps you out right away!  This is one of my breakfast spots of choice (another is Baby Stacks) for good, consistent, yummy breakfast food.  Prices are decent too!",

Just about everything comes with Habla Diablo potatoes, which the waitress accurately explained as having seasoning salt, but they've not really spicy or hot.  Restaurant is very clean, has a huge menu (almost entirely breakfast fare), and is very well staffed. Table-to-waitress ratio was very low, and tables are bussed immediately. Tables also have a little placard on a ring that's normally black smiley face, for all is well, or yellow frowny face for service please. There are managers or expediters wandering around, and they pounce immediately if you turn the placard to yellow (service).  Excellent overall.",

    "text": "So excited we got to eat here! We traveled to Las Vegas with our two young children and NEEDED a family breakfast spot.  I read tons of Yelp reviews and decided to come here.  So glad I did!  They were pretty crowded when we arrived but they somehow had a table available and sat us down right away.  My 1.5 year old was super cranky and everyone who worked there smiled and tried to get him to lighten up- no eye rolling or snippy comments.    The kids got super cute menus that looked like little books/newspapers and crayons.  It kept my daughter well entertained.  Our server was friendly and super quick.  I got the eggs benedict and I'm not sure why.  I had never had it before.  There must've been a picture of it in the menu or something.  But let me tell you, it was SO good!  I've since ordered it back home in Chicago a couple different times and NOTHING compares to the one I had from Egg & I.    Each table has a little egg figure on it.  One side is a happy egg and the other side is a sad egg.  If you need ANYTHING you just turn your egg to sad and someone IMMEDIATELY tends to you- even in the chaos of a super busy day.  We needed more napkins and had more than we knew what to do with within seconds.    The food was great.  The price was average.  The service was amazing.  The place seemed very clean and had fun whimsical decor.  They handled being very busy and I was not uncomfortable as a customer at all.  If we ever head back to Vegas, I'd come here in a heartbeat- and possibly more than once.",

    "text": "Egg & I makes for an amazing breakfast spot -- unbelievably savory morning foods. The menu is very extensive, which is surprising, because they do most of the items on the menu VERY well.  Between the 4 of us that tried Egg & I, we each got different dishes and were all very happy with the food. The portion size is huge as well. If you're not that hungry, share with someone. The omelettes are made with not 1, not 2, not 3, but 4 eggs. FOUR EGGS. It's a beast omelette among eggs.  Three things I will highlight: The eggs benedict, the banana nut muffin, and potatoes. --Eggs Benedict: Order this and you will not be disappointed. The hollandaise sauce that's drizzled over the eggs is something that most places mess up, but at Egg & I, it's made to perfection -- smooth, creamy and seasoned just right. --Banana Nut Muffin: They give this to you when you order and omelette, and don't miss out. It's the most airy, soft, moist -- yes, moist -- muffin you'll ever eat. It's like they fold air into the batter before baking. THAT GOOD. --Potatoes: MY GOD. These are the best side of potatoes I've ever had. I'm convinced they have to be fried, but I'm not sure. The exterior is exquisitely golden crispy with a perfect seasoning blend on the outside. Best potatoes west of the Mississippi; hands down.  Pros: Breakfast food for gods Cons: Can get busy, limited parking",

Their banana nut muffins are INSANE and their egg skillet meals are huge enough to keep you full for the rest of the day, easily. Boyfriend once finished a full chicken fried steak skillet and I feared for his cardiovascular health for a hot minute. As an added bonus, the coffee is delicious and I absolutely recommend the bacon avocado omelette and banana nut French toast.   Service is excellent and we always feel cared for when we visit. Our server today, Bree, was awesome and attentive!  Ambiance is charming. This place isn't great for huge groups, but it is totally perfect for the family.

Both came with potatoes which were crispy which I liked but not so much flavor. Tasted like a buffet potato. Also order a waffle which I thought tasted great but not much better the a chain restaurant. If your looking for a traditional family breakfast and not try a chain place this is okay. Price is pretty fair. We stayed on the strip and I didn't feel like it was worth the cab ride to get there for something I could of had any other breakfast restaurant.

I ordered a classic 2 egg breakfast with a side of salsa and unfortunately they changed the salsa.  It's not the same they use to make and I'm not sure why they did that. This new salsa they use is just down right yucky tasting.  Also when I've ordered eggs here before they usually scramble them soft and this time they were kinda dry.   Maybe this visit was just a slip up so I'm looking forward to coming here again and giving them another try.",

The pro is that is food portion is pretty large, and the staff are super friendly unlike Hash A Go-Go where the hostesses are super snobby because they think they have power toco trial when you could be seated.

Relleno sauce was super flavorful and not too spicy. I selected the warm fresh-out-of-the-oven banana muffin (YUM). We ordered fruit on the side which was in large chunks and consisted of pineapple, 3 types of melon and an orange slice. Very fresh and tasty.  I would love to come back to try other menu items.  It looks like this place can be pretty busy, so allow for time to be seated.  Oscar was very sweet and attentive, letting us know our order was working and did frequent check backs. Plates were cleared and check promptly dropped. Thank you!",

I thought I was saving them money when I asked for no seasoning..... Also some other food item could have been offered to eat in the meantime as a person waits patiently for 30 minutes after ordering.  It's kind of hard when your hungry and you see other people after you sit down around you get their food first.  Also I was not told at the time of ordering that I had to wait 15 min for an unseasoned chicken breast.",

I took off a star for the service, it was average and she neglected to inform us that we can substitute fruits with potatoes. We over heard that from another waitress at the table next to us. The service attitude from other people there was also average, not very friendly and don't feel appreciated being a patron there.",

All the good reviews kept this place on my radar, so when a friend wanted to try somewhere new, we came here.   The wait was not bad at all - especially because as we waited, we had the menu to look over and wow, there are lots to look. Eggs benedict, omlets, pancakes, skillets and more.   Today, I went with the Crazy Chicken Omlet (\"you're crazy for not trying it\"). It's a plateful - so much so that we got a box to enjoy it later.   Outstanding service - They even have happy/sad face eggs you can display on your table to signal for service  I would probably come here again and again to try the rest of the menu.",

Each entree is about $10-$12 and most  come with fruit or potatoes, and toast or a banana muffin- definitely big enough to share. (I would recommend choosing the banana muffin, it's freshly baked and absolutely delicious. Note that you get a free muffin with Yelp check in!)   While I don't consider most of the menu items to be healthy, as is typical of many American breakfast diners, you are given the option to make your order healthier, whether it be by using egg whites only, no cooking oil, etc. There are also SO MANY menu items to choose from.

    "text": "E&I was definitely one of my favorite meals here in Vegas. Originally my friends and I wanted to eat at Peppermill for brunch before leaving Vegas but the wait for 6 people was over 40 minutes. Called in to check for the wait here and was happy enough to find that we would only have to wait for 20 minutes despite it being packed.  There isn't much space inside for customers to sit while waiting for their table; you'll most likely have to wait outside and that kind of sucks especially in the hot summer weather. When we got seated, we were promptly given the menu and starter drinks. Service here is on point. Karla, our server, went out of her way to make everything as easy as possible for us. Instead of having us go to the front ourselves to split our check, she went ahead and split it six ways for us. I LOVE YOU KARLA.  Food portion here is very generous. You definitely will get the bang for your buck because most of the food items costs $8-$12 and only one person in my group was able to finish his order. Whatever you order, make sure the potatoes are included or order it on the side! There's Cajun seasoning on it, I think, and it's amaaaazing. You won't regret coming here!  P.S. there's this cute egg centerpiece on your table. Instead of flagging a waitress/waiter down, just flip it from its black side to the yellow side and someone will come to your table. How cool is that??",

I had been unable to decide between a crepe and a waffle when the waitress suggested half a crepe to go with the waffle. Perfect! So delicious and they have a cool concept of a tag on the table that you can flip up when you need service and anyone will come over, managers, busboys whoever. Brilliant concept. I had often thought a call light or something like that should be in most restaurants and they have one. So, five stars for this place only because I can't give them more than five stars.

There was so much cream cheese, whip cream and artificial strawberry sauce that you couldn't enjoy the French toast at all. It was soggy. No need for syrup at all because it was so sweet. Definitely won't be going back to this place. The only thing good was the hospitality by the waitresses that's why I give it 2 stars.",

She helped us choose the right items and provided super fast service. The owner was a delightful person and very interactive.

We only discovered it since our hotel (The Artisan) was nearby and we used our Yelp app to find the closet breakfast place that wasn't a buffet (by day 3 of buffet hopping, I needed major portion control).  Even though it was Mother's Day and the line was out the door, this tiny restaurant somehow managed to get everyone seated quickly and keep diners moving through the door. The menu was quite extensive for breakfast with everything from stuffed french toast to eggs benedict to the infamous breakfast burrito. I tried the eggs benedict, which came with ranch potatoes and a huge portion of fruit. The orange juice was the best part though, it tasted like it was just squeezed in the kitchen.  Highly recommended if you are staying \"off the strip,\" in Downtown Vegas or if you are on your way out of town!",

I'm so over the pricey and mediocre food at the buffets on the strip for breakfast. So we came here based on the yelp reviews.  First, they have a huge menu, which makes it hard to decide what to get in the first place since I love all breakfast foods. So I went basic with buttermilk pancakes and eggs and bacon. Everyone's eggs were cooked perfectly. Bacon crispy as I had requested. Short stack of 2 pancakes was more than I could finish. My husband and a friend each got some sort of skillet concoction, and I probably didn't finish my pancakes because my fork kept was always in his skillet because it was so good! The four of us were all pleased with our meal.  The place is busy, but we were seated after about 20 minutes. Service was good, portions were large and a reasonable price. I would probably come back to this place next year on our annual trip!",

The waitress is what made me change my mind very friendly and attentive (perfect service). Now to the food, not sure why this place got such high ratings but i wasn't that impressed. They seem to be all about the omelets so the other stuff might not be so good; to start i got a side of biscuits and gravy... more like stale dry biscuits with not enough gravy so again not off to a good start. So the main dish yeah i should have got an omelet but with so many choices i couldn't decide so i got the cabo breakfast burrito... bad choice the burrito was soggy smothered in sauce it was just very un appetizing and the side of house potatoes covered in that texas seasoning was one cold and dry so i don't know if i just got the last of that batch but my experience here was nothing short of just meh nothing that dennys couldn't have filled. Overall the service here at least from my waitress was what gave this a 3 star but the food was not what i expected; especially from the high reviews this place got. NEXT",

So maybe not the BEST place to sit outdoors.

The bottomless coffee wasn't that great, but good enough for a bottomless pot to wake you up in the morning.  Service was incredible! Fast, attentive, friendly. I wish I could remember our waitress's name to give her a 5-star review. The service is definitely what would keep me coming back.

My favorites are the Chicken Enchilada Omelet, the Strawberry Stuffed French toast, the banana nut French toast, and the banana nut muffin here is out of this world.   After a 2008 trip to Hawaii I became obsessed with Hawaiian breakfast and they have both your traditional breakfast of eggs, rice and spam or Portuguese sausage, but they also have loco moco!

It was a Friday, around noon and we had finished with our client earlier than expected. We did a Google search to see what was available close by for food as neither of us had a chance to have a real breakfast that morning.  After scrolling past several chains I landed on a name that wasn't familiar and highly rated - Egg & I.  I was later a little bummed to discover that Egg & I is in fact a chain, as I had hoped it was local to the area (I was unfamiliar with it being from the Northeast/Mid-Atlantic region and never encountering one before).  I will tell you though - I did not regret choosing this place for a late breakfast/early lunch.  When we pulled up the place was hopping.  A good sign that we picked a good place.  Inside there appeared to be a mix of both tourists and locals.  Although they were busy, we were seated very quickly.  Every plate I passed on the way to the table had breakfast food on it, and it all looked and smelled amazing.  The menu was quite extensive... what you would typically find in a diner.  The omelettes and breakfast skillets sounded especially appealing, and come to find out are their most popular choices.  Our waitress was attentive and very helpful in providing menu suggestions.  When she found out it was our first time there, she insisted on bringing us fresh banana nut muffins - which was a great touch!  The muffins were divine - served warm, they were thick and rich.  Like a really good banana bread in muffin form.  I chose to get an egg white omelette with mushrooms, spinach, artichokes and cheese.  It came cooked perfectly and I liked that the cheese was smothered on top and not actually in the omelette.  It was a nice twist.  The breakfast potatoes served on the side were also cooked perfectly - crisp (and not greasy!) on the outside, soft on the inside and seasoned with a signature mix of spices.  Based on what I've seen online, most other locations do seasoned ranch potatoes.  I liked the Vegas location's spicier take!  It had a kick, but wasn't too spicy.  I liked the blend of seasoning so much, I purchased a bottle to take home with me.  My coworker ordered a skillet and raved about how delicious it was!    Even though the place is a chain, they must be locally franchised and I really liked how the Vegas location had the feeling of a locally owned place.    Great food, great people and it was less than 15 minutes from the Strip and airport.  I'd definitely take the trek out for a meal or two on my next Vegas trip.",

Although they were super busy and packed the one weekend day we showed up, we were seated immediately near the back where the patio seating is.   I ordered one of their scrambles I believe and I got the banana bread on the side as well. Banana bread was seriously super moist and very buttery. I loved it!  Service was very friendly and efficient.   Pricing is obviously very affordable being that it's off The Strip. Once again, we love eating where the locals eat. Best bang for your buck fo sho! Thanks Vegas Yelpers for helping us find this decent breakfast joint.",

    "text": "I wanted to try something new for breakfast. I had no idea where to go or what to eat. I came to Yelp like I normally do. Mostly everyone had something positive to say about this place, so my friend and I packed up and headed 15 minutes away to get some good breakfast.  When we arrived, we could tell that it was going to be a long wait and a headache. I sent my friend in, ahead of me, so that I could park. As soon as she walked in, she called me. She said that the place was a mess and she was going to have to come out and wait the 15 minutes it was going to take to be seated. Nevertheless, the hostess pointed out some empty benches, around the corner. So, I walked in to wait.  Upon entering, I was discouraged because a lot of people were standing around waiting. I just knew it was going to take 30+ minutes. Surprisingly, it only took 15 minutes before we were called and seated.  The place is really small and packed to capacity, so I was thankful that we got to sit around the corner where there were only about 4-5 tables. We had plenty space.  The server came around fast to take our drink order. She was quick to bring our drinks back too. She asked us if we were ready to order and we said, \"No, we're looking at Yelp pictures and we need some more time.\" I did ask about the stuff French Toast dish that someone shared on Yelp. She smiled and pointed it out and said that it's a popular dish. Then she left and took orders for people that was around us.  As soon as she walked away, we decided what we wanted, but it took her about 6 minutes to make eye contact again. When she did stop back by, she asked if we were still looking at pictures or if we were ready to order. We went ahead and ordered. It totally slipped my mind to check in and get a free muffin for myself. The waitress said, \"You were on Yelp, did you check in to get the free muffin?\" I was happy she reminded me to do that.  She came back a couple minutes later and brought 2 muffins. I don't even like banana nut muffins but I took it anyways because it was free. I took a bite of it and fell in love. It was so warm and yummy lol. My friend got emotional lol. She said it reminded her of childhood, when her mother used to make them. They were just delicious.  About 12-15 minutes later, our food started to roll out. I order the Stuffed French Toast with eggs, cheese and sausage on it. It also came with seasoned potatoes. It looked incredible. My friend ordered the 2 pork chops that came with 2 eggs, the muffin, that she had already ate, and the seasoned potatoes. Her's looked delicious too.  I LOVE potatoes so I ate those first. I put ketchup all over them and had a ball. My friend didn't like hers, because they were kind of crunchy, so she gave them to me. I put ketchup on them and finished them off too lol.  Next, I started in on my French Toast sandwiches. I didn't like the sandwiches. The sausages, eggs and cheese didn't have much flavor. I thought I made a big mistake. Being that I'm so smart, I thought to scrape the sausages and eggs off the French toast and season the filling myself. I did, and it was 90% better. I ate the filling separately, and ever so often, I would dip the French Toast in the warm syrup that came with my food.  My friend said that the pork chops were Just okay. They were really thin, for sure. I don't know why, but we were expecting some big juicy chops vs the breakfast chops. I wanted to taste the chops for myself, so she took a bite of mine and I took a bite of hers. They tasted as if onions were the main and secondary seasoning. She was right. They were just okay. She did enjoy my mixture of filling and seasoning though.  The good thing is, we got really full and still had a bunch of food left. I'm sure it has something to do with a humongous portion of potatoes we got and the muffin we were served in the beginning.  The service was like a 3/5 because there was a little piece of hair in my water when the server dropped it off. I asked for another one and she just stared at my full cup for like 10 seconds. I guess she couldn't understand my reason behind needing another one. I didn't even mention it because it wasn't a big deal and I didn't want anyone to make a big deal over water.  But also, I took some points off service, because it took my sever a long time to refill my water, once I had actually finished it. It took her maybe 4 or 5 minutes to check on us, after we finished eating too. We just wanted a box to pack up leftovers. When she did stop back by, we asked for the box, she quickly picked one up, dropped it off and walked away. She came back around maybe 3 or 4 minutes later and told us to pay upfront. We were just sitting there, waiting for her to come back by so that we could pay and leave. I'm glad she did stop back by because we probably would have been sitting there for a while.  Although I'm in love with the potatoes and muffins, I probably won't go back because the rest of the food was just average.",

Also, the banana nut muffin is to die for. Their in house hot sauce is also amazing, if you like hotter, you'll have to request the Caliente from your waiter/waitress.",

My party ended up getting the Sunrise Mountain, Bacon & Avocado omelette, breakfast burrito, and the hawaiian bfast (not sure what that was called). When the portions came out we were surprised! Definitely shareable between 2 people, depending on how hungry your party is. The potatoes were very interesting! Overall, everyone enjoyed the food, service, and atmosphere.",

I want to give them a 5 star so maybe I could update later if some minor things change.  Checkout line gets pretty long almost every time so they need 2 cashiers or a faster system.  It takes awhile to get seated sometimes but they did update the seating list so you can get a text when your table is ready. It gives you an estimate on how long the wait will be.  Our quote said 15 minute wait to get seated but it was 21 min, it was a group of 6 during busy time so not bad and that was the longest I have waited.  Food is pretty good, chorizo burrito and mashed potato omelette are very edible.   I really wish they wouldn't give you so many of those weird potatoes though. They are pretty good but not good enough to finish or take home, so almost every customer is sure to throw away a lot, my guess is they through away a few hundred pounds of potatoes every single day because no one finishes them. I would recommend they give you half the amount of potatoes and some fruit which would be so much easier on the stomach and make the meals a little less boring.   I do recommend to stop by and give this place a try though. I will certainly be back soon.   Thanks Egg & I!",

Breakfast potatoes were seasoned perfectly and were yummy.  I had the bacon maple cream cheese French roast and honestly I didn't care for it.  Thank goodness it wasn't stuffed inside the French toast or else it would have been sent back. The French toast,  however,  was under cooked and squishy in the middle. Overall it was simply ok.  With so many choices in Vegas, we won't be back.",

    "text": "Just your average breakfast diner.  I saw Rachel Ray talk about the place on her Tasty Travels show and I thought I'd give it a try and get out of my \"usual\" Vegas routine.  But after going to three Rachel Ray recommended places (Vegas, LA, and Denver), I think I'm done trusting her judgment!  We went on a rainy, Saturday morning around 10:30 and had to wait maybe 15 minutes in a small waiting area which was crowded w/ folks trying to avoid the cold rain.  When we were seated I already knew what we were going to order b/c I had Yelped the place and read their menu online.  I ordered the Ultimate Skillet for the b/f (he likes breakfast skillets), and the large Cashew Blueberry Pancake for myself.    We had the \"famous\" banana nut muffin as our bread choice with the skillet, and let me just say, it was a regular ol' banana nut muffin.  I was gonna buy a whole loaf if it turned out to be good, but really, it was nothing to write home about.  Very average.  The b/f noted that the skillet was made up mostly of their potatoes (another thing that ppl rave about).  I hardly got any of the other ingredients in there so I was disappointed in the skillet, too.  The pancake was alright.  It *WAS* big, as others have commented, but again, no big deal.  It was served with blueberry compote and I thought that helped b/c it tasted sorta dry.  The b/f thought some of the pancake was undercooked b/c he could taste the batter.  Maybe I should've gone w/ the silver dollar sized pancakes?  Also, I think cashews don't really work w/ pancakes (unlike walnuts and macadamia nuts).  The \"large\" 12-oz glass of OJ was pretty small so the b/f thought it was funny they would call it a \"large.\"  Breakfast with tip was around $25 I think.  Not cheap for what you get.  I think I'll make Dunkin Donuts my new Vegas breakfast routine whenever I'm in town again.",

My bf and I grabbed breakfast here a couple days ago and I just had two over easy eggs, wheat toast, and blueberry muffin. Muffin is always moist here and it's served warm so butter is a must. My bf got the steak n eggs with ranch potatoes and said he still loves it. Ranch potatoes are always flavorful here. I also suggest the tuna melt here--delicious. Service is good, we're so used to coming here so we don't mind the inconsistencies they have with their service. Although it would've been great if they wouldnt have alot of turnovers with their staff. It was great coming in here and the staff knew our names. But ever since the turnover we don't know anyone anymore except the host lady. Once again, food makes up for it so we shall be back regardless.",

I looked on yelp for a breakfast joint and found this. We walked in and asked if we could sit and eat within an hour. And the host said we could if we sat outside (since everyone wanted to sit inside because it was a bit chilly that day) so we sat outside... ordered quickly... i had the flapper ( eggs bacon and pancakes. ) My friend had the burger . And the other two had biscuits with gravy. Everything came out very fast. We couldnt belive it.also... Crystal was the best server!! She was constantly checking on us and made sure we had everything we needed. So back to the food. OMG. My food was good. But my friends burger with fries was amazing!!! And the biscuits with gravy! But that burger.... lol. Maybe I was a little hungover.. but it was so juicy.the bread was not your typical diner bun. Also the french fries were the match stick kind with great seasoning.. only thing I would recommend is that they mix plain fries with these seasoned match stick fries ... I found myself fighting to eat all of them because It was a bit salty. Other than that I will definitely come back when I go on my weekend getaways to vegas! :)",

It's easy to see why - this is just great, unpretentious food.  While it's fun to dine well in a dinner environment with tiny gourmet portions and fine presentations, for me breakfast is all about big portions and perhaps a little less regard to the appearance of the food.  It just needs to taste good and help wake your sluggish butt up.  The Egg and I offers breakfast staples - eggs, toast, pancakes, waffles, crepes, french toast, omelet, sausage, bacon - in various combinations and specialty skillets and frittatas as well.  Everything is always fresh, cooked to order, and served by a friendly wait staff.  I wish I lived closer, because I'd probably have their eggs benedict every day.",

I like how they give you a carafe of coffee when you order a cup (like IHOP) so you don't have to constantly wait to get refilled.  Since I usually drink 3-5 cups every morning, this was a plus.  As far as the food, it also met my expectations.  I decided to try the egg-ceptional omelet (has bacon, mushrooms, ham, peppers, onions and sour cream) and not only was it delicious, it was more than enough food to last me through lunch.  I wanted to try the pancakes as well but I couldn't get it as a side so i tried the banana nut muffin that other reviewers had recommended - it was good but not great, but I'm not a big fan of banana nut in the first place so others may enjoy it, i don't know.    The overall price was reasonable and I prefer quality over quantity and other than a handful of a few breakfast places on the strip the Egg and I is one of the best breakfast places around Vegas.  Highly recommended!",

I got the their special corn beef and hash, with two over easy eggs on top and a side of potatoes.  Their corn beef is pulled, not the typical chopped up kind you find most places.  The flavor of this was awesome and the texture was amazing too.  I can still taste it.  On top of that, bust the yolk and it's on!  Wifey had their special banana french toast.  This thing was like a cake, literally.  It didn't have a \"bread\" texture, but it was rather good, something I've never had before and I have to say I really enjoyed it.  It came with syrup, which was a waste because the taste in the french toast was just right.  Prices are cheap for what they serve, service is good, can't complain as the server stopped by a couple of times to check on us.  The place is BUSY though, so expect a wait, especially on a weekend morning.  Highly recommended and they NEED to open more of these breakfast type spots in this area (booo IHOP and OHOP).",

She's the breakfast person of the two of us, and she ultimately chose Egg and I of the two places I suggested.  Two words: No regrets!  The corned beef was the homemade, pulled type of thing, and not your typical canned corned beef! The Sundance omelette is your veggie omelette complete with a side of potatoes and your choice between a banana nut muffin or toast. This omelette had mushrooms, tomatoes, spinach, and artichokes. The feta cheese is the one that brings this omelette home! The only downside is that protein is extra; I ordered a small side of corned beef. The potatoes were seasoned (they are on the salty side, but nothing ketchup couldn't counteract). The banana nut muffin came out warm and moist! It definitely was the highlight at first bite!   Portion size: Large! Both of us took home leftovers! We went from stomach growling to food baby status after our meal.  Service: You flip the egg to the sad one when you need something. Our servers were very friendly and patient. They gave us recommendations on the menu, one even offered us free muffins for our first visit (before the Yelp check in).  Wait Time: immediately seated on a Monday morning  Parking: Shared Lot  Bottom line: Go here for your breakfast fix! It's egg-celent!   Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Way past all the strip hullabaloo is a classic diner spot offering the best breakfast deals ever. Quantity wise, I think Egg&I is unparalleled in both the menu variety as well as their portion sizes. I'd recommend sharing dishes to try more items, things definitely come out family style. We had the Maple bacon French toast which had a unique savory-sweet kick to it- you could really taste both the maple and the bacon in the whipped cream cheese! Amazing dessert for sharing. The banana nut muffin that came with the yelp check in had just the right balance of banana, and was moist but firm, great texture that didn't make you feel too heavy after. The veggie eggs Benedict crushed the eggs Benedict game, all the ingredients were fresh and the home fries were perfection. I don't usually like home fries, but these had a special seasoning that was particularly delectable. Also, kudos to Egg&I for having such a great online seating system. You can check using a link texted to you to see your place in line, and turn over is quick and smooth. Anytime I stop by in Vegas I'll be sure to be back!",

Staying at the Bellagio on the Strip with a lakeside room. Needless to say room service for the same breakfast would cost 4 times as much.  We ate at the original Egg and I and Penny the store manager came by multiple times and our waitress (I think her name was Denise).  I like to write reviews when we travel. By far a must breakfast if you are in Las Vegas. I have been coming to Las Vegas for years, cannot believe I haven't found this place sooner. Definitely a \"locals secret\" so I'm getting the word out with Everyone back in my hometown Tallahassee, Florida.",

She was attentive, didn't hesitate ever and extremely friendly! Karen made sure our food orders didn't get messed up and addressed a minor issue we did have. Our food was so delicious. A great place to eat, especially after a weekend of partying. I do recommend calling ahead to make reservations, especially for such a large group. We didn't do that and Lesly the host with red hair told us it would only be a 5-10 minute wait, seems reasonable. Until it turned into over 30 minute wait time, her giving our table away to someone who called after we were already been waiting and I won't even start in on lack of customer service skills. Either way it goes, Karen and the food were so amazing that we'll be back next time we come to Vegas. We'll also be sure to call ahead of time, right Lesly, right. -Leisah H.",

Slid out here for the MAGIC convention. Whenever I hot anywhere I like to eat where the Locals do. With Vegas Being Vegas for the most part it's always some kinda tourist type dining experience. I didnt look at pics or nothin so I was kinda bummed I didnt order the Stuffed French Toast (I was checking in and seen a picture. My wife Yelp'd the spot). I ended up getting the \"Sunrise Mountain\" not sure But our Server Tamara said it was \"Really good\". I also want to add that Tamara is A-1 like the Steak Sauce. I overheard her talking to another table offering suggestions, without prompt. See, I dont eat like the average person so I no longer ask for suggestions. That's Dope cause I be places where servers be on some other shit. Not looking. Don't want to talk, really. We're  in a time where most establishments show it's the money not the people. I'm all about Love in Business (Being a small Business owner) cause it shows appreciation to the customer base. Anyway, shes Lovely, made us feel welcomed and comfortable. I just be rambling a lot cause i be having alot I want to get out. Who knows the next time you and I will ever Interact?? If you ever looking for good eats in Vegas I highly recommend this place.

I found the newspaper style menus, the tablet/card reader at every table interesting. It gave a vintage yet modern feel to the place. My waitress, Denisse went above and beyond and really made an impact on my short visit to Egg and I. She managed to surpass the high bar I expect from smaller chain breakfast spots by never letting me have an empty cup, consistently checking on us without getting annoying and by giving off the energy that she genuinely enjoyed her job.  I truly believe the management at Egg and I treats their employees exceptionally well based on how my server interacted with me and others. And that is the key to a healthy establishment. 10/10 definitely the new breakfast joint.",

I ordered the Green Chili Hash.  Can't wait to try it!  Also , they have a cool way of letting us get their attention.  See the pictures.  The Black egg means everything is fine; the yellow egg means we need something:  I did a test run (didn't need anything) and they were on us immediately!  That was worth a couple of extra dollars in the tip!  Angel left a pot of coffee on our table which is a plus in any breakfast restaurant setting...  Fast forward 30 mins....  food came out way sooner than we expected.  Cook staff is ON POINT!   Green Chili Hash was phenomenal!  Rice and beans and sourdough toast a perfect compliment.  Better half had the stuffed French toast with strawberries and cream cheese.  Pro tip:  get the strawberry and cream cheee in the side (unstuff the stuffed FT).  Might be too sweet for some but by unstuffing, you can manage that sweet tooth just right!  Love me some Egg and I!!!",

I would say borderline on the seasoning. The service was great for a Saturday morning, and they were very busy. I recommend sitting outside in the morning, it is quite pleasant with the misters on. The food was very tasty, and the portions are excellent for the price. I will definitely be going back here again.",

First time guests get a free banana nut muffin.  IT WAS AWESOME!!  I even bought an $8 loaf after my breakfast. I had a chicken sandwich and it was just ok.  My girl had a spinach omelet w/ feta cheese (the Kay special) and thought it was just ok.  I guess after eating the muffin it was just a slight let-down from there.  At least I enjoyed my loaf for the next couple of days after.  I would come here again and order the pancake stack.  It looked really good.  Service is excellent and prices are pretty decent.",

    "text": "Food is excellent if you can get it.  We had a table of 7, and 6 received their meals within a reasonable amount of time, except me of course!  Not one word was said to me, so we put an unhappy face on Mr Egg, but I still had to flag down our waitress, which took at least 5 minutes.  She seemed pretty annoyed when I asked where my food was. She said \"we can only put 4 orders on one ticket, so yours will take longer\". Hmm so why did 6 orders came out???  Finally, someone else came out because of the unhappy face on Mr Egg, and asked what she could do. I said everyone is almost done with their breakfast and I don't have mine. She went to check, making sure that we put the happy face back on Mr. Egg.. A few minutes later, our waitress came back and said that they were still baking the biscuits, and promised that she was watching for my order. Hmm, by then 3 people at my table had finished their breakfast. After another 5 minutes everyone was done eating , Finally a different person brought my order, with the explanation \"they poached the eggs, so they had to remake it with my cooked eggs\".  Ok which one of you clucks the truth?  So I got to eat while 6 people at my table watched me, so needless to say I ate pretty fast and didn't get to enjoy the egg-cellent food.  I'm pretty easy going when it comes to food orders, as normally we all do our best, But by the time I got my food and had to listen to 3 different reasons, I really did expect for them to take my meal (and only my meal) off of the bill. Was that too much to ask? Well I left with egg on my face, no discount...not even an apology. All I got was a \"there now you have your breakfast, you are all set\".  Really??? No we won't be going back to that location.",

The banana nut muffins are soft delicious fluffy and warm, served to you before your main course comes. The portions are well sized, prices wern't outrageous, but the waitress forgot my friend's toast. I had a crepe, which comes with ranch potatoes. It was much more dough-y that I expected and would have liked. Makes me wish I just ordered a scramble. Overall I liked driving off the strip to see outer Vegas to get good food at not ridiculous prices.",

We wanted a descent price, tasty breakfast and thanks to fellow Yelper's I was able to track down this great place. Our group of four were seated fast and by no time we were all enjoying our breakfast's.  For our first visit I had the Egg's Benedict Florentine- Fresh spinach atop canadian bacon, two poached eggs & a grilled english muffin, smothered with hollandaise and served with fresh fruit garnish and ranch potatoes. We all left full and happy. For our second visit I tried CHRISTY'S CINNAMON RAISIN FRENCH TOAST- Cinnamon Raisin bread dipped in a custard batter. Grilled Golden and lightly sprinkled with powdered sugar. Served with Sassy Apples. This is a great spot, it seemed like it had \"The Regulars\", so that's nice to see they have loyal and satisfied customers.",

It wasn't far away, the parking was good, we were seated immediately, and after we ordered we had our food in under 10 minutes.  Our waitress was friendly and fast.  I love this place because you can ask anyone to get you something, you aren't just tied to one wait person.  You have an egg posted by the table, you need something you flip it to the unhappy yellow side, you are happy you leave it on it's happy side, when they see the yellow side they come over and see what they can do for you.  We had biscuits and gravy, which were piping hot and tasted good and served different ways.  We also got coffee, and they left the pot at the table for us.  How cool is that, no waiting to refill that cup when it's empty.  Love this place and will def come back when we visit Vegas again.",

The menu is a small newspaper. Literally. A massive selection of eggs and other breakfast favorites means there is someone for everyone.   We both ordered egg dishes and they were huge portions at reasonable prices. A little more than $20 for the two of us; and you can eat here cheaper than we did if you want.   It's a no-nonsense diner-type atmosphere inside focused on fast service. The staff was fabulous. Our server, Karla, was like a best friend from the moment we sat down. They have these \"smile and frown@ signs on the table. If you are good, you put up the smile. If you need anything, you put up the frown. They watch for it and respond quickly.   There's a great outside patio and its dog-friendly. It's also a very kid friendly place. Plenty of space even at prime breakfast time and there was no wait. They turn tables quickly.   One thing of note:  they give you a pot of coffee. But on other drinks, refills are not free. Fine by us since the drinks they serve are very large.   What a great find!  Thanks to Karla and the staff here for giving us a place to come back to when we are in town again.",

    "text": "Alike so many Vegas go'ers we were looking for a Good Breakfast place after our late night out on the Strip. As always, I turned to Yelp. I was craving Chicken Fried Steak and Eggs. my cousin wanted an Omelette and my Niece wanted pancakes or waffles. Yelp brought up several options and I read the reviews. The Egg and I had everything we wanted and the reviews were good. So, off we went. We got there pretty fast from the Strip about 15 mins. Upon our arrival the place was full. We were told it would be a 10-15 min wait but a table came up outside rather quickly. It was a hot day but we were starving and they had cooling mist sprayers which helped a bit. We were greeted by our waiter OSCAR who was friendly and hospitable. He took our drink order, mad some recommendations from the Specials and left us to figure out our orders. He delivered the drinks with these Bannana Nut muffins we didn't ask for. I didn't want the muffin but after I had a pinch I was hooked. Yes, it was warm and delicious. With the size of my breakfast I decided to save it for breakfast the next day. We placed our orders and no time after that we had our orders. The food looked and tasted great. The portions were large and pippin hot. We were all silently eating and enjoying our meal.   Ok for the review. I am really specific about my chicken fried steak and I rarely get it because it usually sucks unless my mom or Southern grandma made it. But this one was quite good I must admit. My only complaint was with the potatoes. They were cooked well nice and crispy but was a bit salty. I prefer to add my own salt to taste because of that. My family agreed that their potatoes were also a bit salty. But overall our food was delicious and the service Great!!  Oscar is truly great at his job and we truly appreciated his service. We would gladly go to The Egg & I again without hesitation.  Oh....and the Bannana Nut muffin was AWESOME the next day with coffee :-)",

    "text": "I finally got to eat @ Egg & I this past Saturday, 03/30/13. Monday comes along and I'm back in the office and I read that a car plows into this restaurant. WTF? I hope everyone who was injured in this moronic act a speedy recovery. I also hope they are able to be fully operational again ASAP (if not already).   Egg & I is located minutes from the strip on Sahara. I believe their other restaurant goes by the name of Egg Works. This restaurant is open everyday but only between the hours of 6am-3pm. We got plastered the night before and somehow were able to wake up and drive our zombie behinds to eat here the next day right before noon. The wait wasn't too bad considering the restaurant isn't too big to begin with.   Our server Jacky was a sweet heart. She was uber friendly and attentive even when it seemed like the restaurant was chaotic. How many other tables did she have with a bunch of hung over dudes, possibly acting a fool beats the hell out of me. She was holding it down like a seasoned veteran. She started us off with that infamous banana nut muffin. This is not to be missed especially with a cup of joe.  Not going to lie and say that this place serves health conscious types of food. They may have some \"lighter\" dishes but the menu is dominated by heavy hitters. Everything we ordered was either smothered with country gravy or had some sort of heavy but tasty sauce. We thought of this great game plan to all order our own entrees and add an extra French toast plate to share amongst the five of us. Bad, bad decision. One entree is an adequate amount of grub. Anymore, you may want to check your blood pressure.  There are plenty of choices on their menu and as you can imagine, numerous egg inspired dishes. From skillets to classics, you'll find something for everyone. I had the Country Benny, you can look it up yourself. Let's just the menu states, \"This one's a heart stopper.\" Need I say more? That dish was good but I also hated life afterwards. No regrets, it was delish while I was conquering that beast but just be ready for the consequences.  Egg & I is definitely a hit. I can see why locals and tourists flock to this establishment. We ate here and I had to immediately go back to our hotel to pass out and recover in time for night two. Only in Sin City...",

I have worked in the food and beverage industry for 18 years, starting off as a Jolly Roger breakfast server ending up at Ruth's Chris Steakhouse, and everything in between. I do not understand how this restaurant has such high reviews. The pancakes are so rubbery it's hard to cut and tastes doughy and undercooked. They DO NOT use real eggs! My husband ordered a ham & cheese omelet. The eggs tasted watery and you couldn't even taste the meat. The Diablo potatoes were over seasoned but the most decent tasting thing on our table. The apple juice tasted like it was dispensed from a moldy dispenser, it has a funk to it. I ordered French toast, and even that was tasteless! We will never eat here again...oh and my husband felt so sick after eating he threw up. I asked the waitress about the rubbery pancakes because my arms were literally getting sore while I was cutting them and she really had no response, and just asked me if I wanted a new one made. Maybe they used to be good long ago,  but not anymore",

The guacamole makes it refreshing.  ~ 8/10  SKILLET BREAKFAST:  Santa Cruz Skillet (seasoned chicken breast, green chillies, onions, homemade Santa cruz sauce) $10.99 ~ Don't like this at all! Too meaty, too saucy and too heavy for a breakfast. 3/10  1st visit: Server Brady's service is really good. Our table is always on \"Smiley Face\" as he will constantly walk over and ask if we're doing ok. Good service!   2nd visit: Server Amanda is very attentive to our needs. Ensuring we had all we need. Great service!  Tips: ~ Check-in and get 1 FREE Banana Nut Muffin ~ Love the Happy and Unhappy Face on the table. If you need attention, flip to Unhappy face, if you're happy, flip it back to Happy face. ~ Write a review on yelp/tripadvisor and mention your server's name and they're one step closer to win a trip for 2 to Disney California to meet Mickey Mouse.",

    "text": "In spite of its obvious chain affiliation, the food is better than average.  First, there is the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet.  Just so you know, the CFS has a crispy crust, cut into bite sized pieces and placed on top of their mini crispy potato cubes.  Topped with a good tasting, creamy gravy, this dish is really good.  I had to restrain myself from ripping it away from my son.  The Hanks Scramble contains fresh spinach, mushroom, tomato, and cheese.  I don't know where they went wrong, but I have had much better tasting vegetable scrambles.  It was a disappointment mainly because it tasted way to bland. Dumping their house salsa on it redeemed it considerably.  Then there were the pancakes and bacon. Decent pancakes, but nothing that stands out.  The bacon was salty but not smoky tasting and rather flaccid.  I like crisp.  Good, not great.  The Waffle and Bacon combo was similar, neither the waffle nor the bacon were crispy.  I really liked the serve yourself carafe of coffee left at our table. Got it hot.  Got it exactly when we needed it.  The service was excellent. Maybe part of that was because they did not need to run around filling coffee cups instead of taking care of more important matters like getting food out of the kitchen fast. Smart.  This was ok, but we shall continue to search for the ultimate Mom and Pop places in Vegas.",

Much much cheaper to eat at than on the strip. 2.  The drive is close by from the Stratosphere. 3.  Portions are VERY generous and filling. 4.  Service is outstanding with many smiles (thank you Amanda).  =) 5.  Hot sauce selection extends from regular tabasco and tapatio (thank goodness!). 6.  Saturday mornings are a little less crowded than Sunday mornings. 7.  Homemade banana nut muffin. 8.  Parking in a shared lot.  BIG TIP:  Be sure not to wait until 10:30am to get up and eat here or else you will be waiting.  So why leave the strip to come here??  To be honest, I wanted something good for also a good price.  You know that dry, empty feeling you get from some run-of-the-mill restaurants?  That breakfast where you are happy that you ate it, however, it just settles in your stomach because it has to, not because it wants to?  Exactly!  Here at Egg & I, you get breakfast that is prepared with meaning and with purpose.  Wonderfully filling and satisfying.",

    "text": "This is a great breakfast option off the strip. Took my family here for breakfast recently and had enjoyable experience.   It's about a 10 minute drive from main casinos, located in strip mall. Popular dining spot for locals and gets packed on weekends. Luckily, we arrived early before the breakfast rush and were seated immediately. Good thing too, 20 minutes after a bus load of people arrived and place was full.  Country style atmosphere and decor provide the perfect backdrop for their food. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating is available. Old-fashioned breakfasts are the specialty here, including huge omelet platters, pancakes, eggs benedict and a large selection of house specialties. Prices are reasonable and large portions. I highly recommend trying their famous banana nut muffin. OMG, so good! Super moist and the flavor profile is off the charts. I got mine free with my Yelp check-in. You can also substitute the toast that comes with your breakfast entrees for a muffin.   We ordered \"The Works\" scramble, Fresh Veggie omelet and the Hawaiian breakfast spam and eggs. Everything was fantastic! Served in large skillet, the scramble was yummy. It's loaded with sausage, ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers and mushrooms, served with hash browns and topped with the fluffiest scramble eggs. Enough for 2, I literally devoured everything and no regrets. I loved the taste and texture of the hash browns, lightly crisp and tender. I usually prefer shredded kind, but this was equally nice. Of course, who doesn't love spam and eggs for breakfast? Simple Hawaiian-Pinoy breakfast done well here, served with steam rice. Just the way us locals love them.  Most of the time we usually dine along the strip because it's convenient. Egg and I was definitely worth the drive and waking up early for. Service was excellent too. Our server did a phenomenal job, friendly and refilled our coffee regularly. Still thinking about those banana nut muffin. Looking forward to coming back.",

I ordered the Works Skillet. It had peppers, tomatoes, mushrooms, ham, bacon, potatoes and eggs. It was off the charts delicious. I also got the banana nut muffin instead of toast, which came out first. It was a very good and if you check-in you get a free banana nut muffin (I got 2nds). Not only was the food good, it came in a timely manner. I can eat a lot and I thought it was plenty of food. A lot of my friends had to take half of their meal to go!   The server did an ok job on greeting us and bringing us our drinks. She wasn't the best server in the world but she did a great job with our large party.  She kept our drinks full and we had plenty of napkins without asking.   Overall, I rate this place a 5. It was great food, great service, and quick food at decent prices.

What's better than hot ages and fresh-cut fruits to start your day. I just checked in via Yelp app and they gave me a check in bonus - 1 free Banana Nut Muffin! Very good, I just love those type of offers - just check my self in and here we go something free is on the way. The Egg and I is a really good place to have breakfast, lunch, and brunch. They are serving in huge portions two plates are enough for 3 people.  One can eat outdoors too. The prices are affordable.  Plates like French toast with scrambled eggs or Stuffed French Toast are even cheap. Quck service and friendly staff.  During my last visit, my wallet was lost. Actually, I lose it in the toilet.  A few hours later a manager called me to come and bring my wallet back.  With everything inside! Thank you guys!",

The waiting space inside is really small so you go in and give the hostess your name and their app will text you when your table is ready. Then wait outside for your own sanity and fresh air.   Once you are seated, they give you the cutest menu because it looks like newspaper. This whole place has a very homey vibe. There is a good mix of locals who know all the waiters and tourists who are overwhelmed with the menu (me). Our wonderful waitress, Karla, suggested that I got the Chipotle Pork Eggs Benedict and I was so glad I listened! But I'm not here to talk about that. I'm here to talk about their breakfast potatoes. They are THE BEST, crispiest, best seasoned breakfast potatoes I've had! They are cut into small crispy bites and are so well seasoned I almost burst my stomach trying to finish them all.   All in all, there are so many damn delicious things on this menu. I doubt you can try them all even if you went every day. I'd definitely recommend it if you're in the area.",

It had three types of meat in it and two kinds of cheese with potatoes. He was very pleased. He also ordered the banana nut muffin when given the choice of that or toast. THE MUFFIN WAS THE HIGHLIGHT OF THE MEAL! It was brought out piping hot and delicious. I ordered the veggie works Benny. It was really good. Eggs Benedict on an English muffin with spinach tomato and avocado with hollandaise sauce; it was served with potatoes. Very good. The Benedict egg was a little more watery than I expected, but fresh and still very tasty. I would definitely return!",

I was literally feeling like I'd been run over by something just wanted to relax and eat. Blonde waitress obviously doesn't know my plight and added insult to injury by comping someone that already ate two hours prior and had not been in dire stress situation like myself but I didn't know till after the fact.   I ordered eggs and they were green but I couldn't bother with changing anything then I thought to get order to go. Anyway everything got me sick and I'm sick to my stomach realizing the waitress judged me because I was dead tired from what was not my fault and rewarded the other person for what ? I'd like management to contact me it's ridiculous service and food was awful. Why the good reviews who knows maybe they were comped too and the ones that pay get crap food.",

When we pulled up (Sunday noon) lots of folks waiting outside. Went in to be put on the list. For party of 2 in or out seating, they said it would be a 15-20 min wait. Cool. They use a text system. When you click on the link, it tells you what place in line your party is and how many minutes you've been waiting. Very cool. We ended up being seated inside about 27 minutes later- no big deal, it is Sunday.  I got the veggie skillet, light cheese. Exactly what I was looking for, the veggies were cooked to perfection. My friend got country fried steak. We also got a short stack of pancakes to share and the banana nut muffin.  The muffin is very delicious! Pancakes were pretty good 4/5). Country fried steak and gravy-a little salty but still veryyyyu good! Be warned, A LOT of potatoes come on that plate.  Service was very timely, our server Curtis was great and attentive.  Our breakfast was $31 so great value all around!",

    "text": "Always a wait, 20 min to 60 min, but always worth the wait. There is a reason why this breakfast restaurant finds itself on all the online lists of places to eat in Las Vegas, it is delicious! Mainly, the habla diablo seasoned potatoes. Order a skillet, and these potatoes will be nestled among your skillet choices. You won't find these anywhere else, and they are worth ordering! They sound spicey, but they aren't too bad, they just have a slight kick with the seasoning, but nothing that is going to make your mouth run hot.  I have tried several other dishes, and they are all great, but don't stand out much above other top breakfast places. The portions are nice sized, and you are going to get your American breakfast standard fare, no weird or fancy twists to the meals you know and love. They do have mimosas.  The ambiance is not my favorite. It is bright and the tables are pretty close to each other. The walls have farming murals painted on them, but it's not the most comfortable dining experience. The chairs and tables are pretty old and slightly worn.  The service has, on average, been quick and good, though not the most attentive. They have an easy fix for that though, as they have a cute little egg character that you can switch it's expression from happy to sad if you need anything, and someone will stop by very quickly.",

    "text": "When my brother was in Kindergarten last year, he got some sort of award for some achievement I have since forgotten, which resulted in a coupon for the Egg & I/Egg Works. I don't think we ever used it, but I had looked it up on Yelp last year, and remembered it had good reviews.  Fast forward to yesterday, 4/2/11. While eating a breakfast of homemade blueberry waffles and chillin on the patio, Lawrence T. was telling me all about how much he loved breakfast foods - all kinds. I was trying to figure out where we were would eat before we headed off to The Adventure Dome later during the day (we ended up not going.) I was bummed when he said breakfast foods were where his heart was, because it's my least favorite meal of the day.   Around 2 PM, after driving around and me not remembering the names or addresses of the places that I wanted to try on the west side (where he lives) I spotted \"Egg & I.\" Despite the fact I'm not into breakfast, I decided to suck it up and offer this place as an option because Lawrence had told me he liked breakfast so much. It helped that I vaguely remembered that it had good reviews here on Yelp.   Upon walking in, you get hit in the face with the \"breakfast\" restaurant smell. You know what I'm talking about. We were seated immediately and took it all in. Lawrence was all into the fact they had soccer on their tv and that they had a zillion choices on their menu. Despite the extensive choices, not too long after sitting down, we ordered. I got the tortilla soup and house salad with ranch, and Lawrence got some omelet and fruit... and was mistakenly given a humongous side of the most delicious skinny fries ever (the problem was quickly remedied by a pregnant lady who worked there bringing him the fruit he actually ordered.)   The tortilla soup, while not the type I'm used to was SO good, I could not stop eating it. The house salad rocked, especially with the sprouts on top, and the ranch dressing was on par with that of The Mad Onion (aka DELICIOUS!) I didn't try any of Lawrence's fruit or omelet, but the few fries I stole off of his plate were the best fries I'd ever tasted. Yeah, they're that good.   I have to agree with Bonnie G.'s statement that, \"You know the food is good when you are so full and you keep eating.\"  Lawrence kept eating his fries, while saying he should stop because he was tired of fried foods... but they were too tempting, even when blanketed by napkins on top to hide them from view, hehe.  I was so full toward the end of the meal, but my salad was so good, it was hard to finally push the remainder away.    For our meals + coffee + $5 tip, it came out to $27 and some change. We both confided over our meal that we weren't sure about how good this place would be when we pulled up to the place, but after trying the food, it was super bomb.",

    "text": "This place was horrible! Did we come on a bad day or what?   The 4 of us decided to stop in here for breakfast before making the 10 hour trip back home. We decided to give this place a try as it had really good reviews.   We got in and got seated pretty fast, there was quite a few people. I ordered a vanilla latte coffee whatever and it was way too sweet. I feel like I might have gotten diabetes from that coffee.   Aftwr looking at the newspaper menu for a few minutes I decided on the chicken fried steak skillet since I am a big fan of all things chicken friend. The 3 others got the Mexican omelet, I believe that is what it was called.   The food came out pretty quick, first glance at my chicken fried skillet made me queesy but I was hungry and I thought it can't be that bad. The country gravy was gelatinous. It was weird. Like a slime blob of gravy exploded all over my food. Whatever. Give it a try.   It didn't taste that bad but it didn't taste good. It was very salty and I just couldn't get over the slime gravy so I stopped eating. Everyone else with their Mexican omelet had tears streaming down their face. Apparently the omelet was too spicy to even enjoy. My partner is Mexican and loves her spicy foods. She is obsessed with all things spicy, tears will be streaking down her face and she will still say it isn't spicy enough, but even she struggled with the omelet. Maybe not that it was too spicy but that it tasted like crap spicy.   Anyways, about 10 minutes after trying to eat my slime it hit me like a brick, I made a beeline to the bathroom and was in there for about 10 minutes only to return 5 more times.   As you can imagine the 10 hour car ride home was horrible. Never again.",

The banana nut muffin is to die for and if you tell them it's your first time at the restaurant, they'll give you one for free. I love free things.  The portions are huge and - how shall I put this delicately? - perfect for when you're hung over.

    "text": "Solid breakfast joint!  We decided to go off the strip for breakfast this past weekend to save some money. I swear we always spend at least $50 on breakfast when we eat in the hotels. Breakfast at Egg & I was under $30 :)  They were busy when we arrived and we waited about 15 minutes to be seated. They put us on the patio, luckily it wasn't too hot yet and there was one table left with shade. It was tolerable.  Service was decent but not over the top. They have a system where if you need something you flip over a plastic egg on the table and the waitress will come back. Seems like they never check on you unless you flip the egg.  Breakfast was good. I had the eggs benedict with bacon instead of canadian bacon. One of the bacon slices was too fatty and not cooked enough, but the other one was good. The hollandaise was tasty, although a little runny. The potatoes on the side had a nice flavor to them.  BF had their daily special, which was Cinnamon Roll French Toast. It was really good, had a custard batter. Too sweet for me, but he enjoyed it a lot. That was also served with a little cup of yummy cinnamon apples. I liked those very much.  You pay at the register, which is kind of annoying because that area is already super cramped with people waiting and there isn't really anywhere to stand in line to pay without getting in somebody's way. Overall though, a good breakfast place. If you're willing to drive a couple minutes off the strip to save some cash, I recommend this place!",

It's got a half fried/half baked feel to them. I prefer these potatoes over hash browns. Pancakes are good sized and fluffy. The portions here are very filling. 2nd best to hash house a go go in my humble opinion.",

I've driven by a lot of times and never stopped.  That was changed today.  We were seated promptly and were served coffee and water promptly while we looked through their extensive menu done in the form of a tabloid newspaper.  I got the Benedict's Garden, a vegetarian Eggs Benedict.  It came with English muffin halves on the bottom, then sliced grilled tomatoes, some avocado, and topped (the menu says smothered which is close) with Hollandaise.  There were potatoes and a side of some fresh fruit.  My friend got the Mexican omelette which was the special of the day.  Everything was really good.  My eggs and the mixture of avocado and tomato with the Hollandaise was quite good.  The breakfast potatoes were really flavorful and the small slice of canteloupe and fresh pineapple was like having a dessert at breakfast.  My friend thought his omelette was one of the best he has had.  Be prepared for a large breakfast.  The omelettes are listed as four eggs.  We chatted and passed a considerable amount of time.  Service was fast and cheerful.  It was a good way to start the day.",

The breakfast burrito was amazing and the salsa is very good. It tastes authentic and had the right amount of heat. Since it was our first time, we got to sample the banana nut muffin. AMAZING! I'm ready to go home and make a batch of my own! They come out warm and have room temperature butter at the table. Winning! The potatoes are seasoned, crunchy on the outside, and fluffy on the inside. Very reasonably priced, too!",

    "text": "Great breakfast spots are my favorite and this is one of the best I've ever found, thanks to YELP.  One of the most innovative breakfast menu's I've seen and particularly impressive is the ability to execute so many offerings to perfection.  Service was outstanding, our waitress, Jessica, was fast and efficient.    The feature here is undoubtedly their banana nut muffins.  They were excellent, rivaling the best homemade I've ever tasted.  What amazed me is how they can produce as many as they have to do to supply this very busy and fairly large restaurant.   They were warm and obviously very fresh and tasted as good as most any homemade.  They have a slight gingerbread taste to them so I suspect molasses is a part of the recipe.   I know how much work they are to make homemade which is why I really admire their dedication to featuring this treat.    The food was really good as well, because they wouldn't earn any points from my son who doesn't eat anything with bananas in it.  I feel my opinion was well founded and based on a total of three banana muffins- mine, my son's, and a free one as a YELP check-in bonus.  I carried two out and enjoyed them later in the day.  I had the three little pigs omelet which was great.  The potatoes were done to perfection- crisp on the outside, evenly done throughout with a nice seasoning on the outside.  My son had a western omelet with tomatoes substituted for the potatoes.  A nice patio is outside with misters to help battle the Vegas temps and low humidity.  It's no question this is a premier spot to enjoy a wonderful breakfast in Las Vegas with just a little drive from the downtown strip.",

Made the first mistake while serving drinks (15minutes after we got sat) and it just never got better. We eat here or more often at Egg Works and normally it's amazing or at minimum pretty good so that made today so much worse. The manager made a good effort but one of our party who didn't eat so a little offended by the coupons she gave us for the problems. Buy one get one half off. I didn't have that much of a problem with them but she thought that was kind of rude. Service bad, food substandard, orders incomplete and you offer a bogo?

Seriously, note the following reference to a study in Heart journal:   \"Researchers studied nearly half a million Chinese adults over nine years and found up to one egg per day led to a lower risk of heart disease and stroke. Experts have pointed out, however, that participants in that study were not eating a Western diet.\"  As long as I'm sharing some of the truths about the benefits of eating at The Egg & I, I might as well touch on another universal that all patrons at the Egg & I should consider: the complimentary banana nut muffins. Each person who sits for an entree is gifted these savory, ethereal bread saucers that fly off the plate and into the palate. Every person who sets foot in the Egg & I moist try the banana nut muffins. They're surreal.  The entree I ordered rivaled the appetizer in quality. A member of the attentive waitstaff recommended I try the blueberry waffle. This dish ended up being a simple and refreshing repast. Each berry retained its dewy blue vibrance. I mowed through my plate so quickly I nearly neglected to try the dish the GF ordered.  What a rich breakfast the Mexican Crepe proved to be. Eggs, Chorizo, Onions, Green Chiles served with the Habla Diabla salsa that's sure to bring the heat. I burnt down all my old eggspectations about crepes because of this hot commodity. I will have to return just to be certain the crepe was that outstanding. Would that I had set aside my waffle a few more times.   The merchandise for sale at The Egg & I is not too shabby either. $15 gets one a quality tie dye shirt featuring a Grade A cartoon of a couple of super mellow, hippie eggs. Peace out dudes.",

We enjoyed the prime rib Benny and Mexican omelette. So I highly recommend those two menu items. Don't forget to unlock your Yelp coupon for a free delicious banana nut muffin.  And if you're really lucky in Vegas, you'll get Manuela Gomez as your server and she will bring your food with the best smile and service!",

    "text": "A surprising Easter egg (pun intended). A nice, soulful place with quality breakfast items. I went as part of a group that ordered their crepe, eggs benny and some sides. The benny was delicious - nice, rich, fatty. The crepe was fine, but a little too eggy. It was a thin omelette rather than a crepe.   Oh! Their banana-nut muffin was a highlight. I'd definitely suggest grabbing them. Moist, fragrant and flavorful little domes of joy they were.   Seems like a place that has a lot of wait, so if you can, go during the weekdays. This place was a nice, homely change from the hullabaloo of the Strip.",

The dining area was well lit & open. They also have outdoor seating as well with a mist sprinkling from above to help give some relief from that Vegas heat. For some reason tho I just cant give them 5 stars. I guess I just wasnt blown away but yes I'd eat here again.  My wife said her Egg & Chili skillet was salty. Other than that there were no other complaints.   Like I said \"Not bad\"...  Here's the breakdown... Service: 5/5 Food: 4/5 Restaurant: 4/5",

Showed up like an hour afterward and the line was out the door. The wait time was still about the same. They had people in and out. They ask for your preference when you check in to see if you prefer to sit inside or out. Then text you when your table is ready.  When you check in on Yelp you get a free banana nut muffin, which is pretty good. The Country Fried Steak is a solid choice that comes with 2 eggs and seasoned potatoes. The Bacon Maple Cream French Toast was okay, not really my thing. The French toast itself was good but I could do without the bacon maple cream cheese. Overall, a cool little spot to check out if you are in town.",

We arrived around 10am on Saturday and where seated right away.  The menu is intense, its big and packed with a lot of great sounding dishes. I knew I was in the mood for a skillet, so I went with the Fiesta Skillet which came with a banana nut muffin.  The banana nut muffin was fresh and warm and huge and tasted great and disappeared quickly.  The Fiesta Skillet had green chilis, onions, tomatoes, cheddar & jack cheese, habla diablo seasoned potatoes and 2 eggs over easy. This was a great tasting skillet and just what I was craving for breakfast! The habla diablo season potatoes were not spicy at all, but seasoned well, was hoping for the spicy factor, but hey that's what hot sauce is for.  Egg & I is a great place to grab breakfast off the strip, I'll be back next time I am in town!",

My coworker mentioned this spot to me several times and I was so looking forward to trying the stuffed French Toast. Okay, that didn't work out well, the french toast seemed to be missing something, I wasn't really WOW'd seemed somewhat dry and yes I did dip it in syrup but it still seemed like eeehhhh. The seasoned potatoes would've been tasty but were well OVER SEASONED, way too salty. The highlight was the warm banana nut bread which is A MUST TRY! It's brought to the table seemingly right out the oven and if you slice it in half and add a little butter....WINNING! OK, so our server was Perry who was polite and patient although he did seem to be a bit distracted, possibly because it was busy. Sis and I ordered the bacon stuffed french toast and out other sister ordered a scramble. She reported the scramble was very tasty and it looked appetizing but she also said her potatoes were very salty. We sent our french toast back and decided to share the works waffle which I clearly stated I wanted to be very light and not crispy although that is not what we received and to top it off, the waffle was just warm which can be seen by the butter just sitting on top of my waffle. Overall, I promise I would come back just for the banana nut bread which I guess I can say was worth the $12 Lyft ride to this location. I again Thank Perry for being so pleasant.",

Did you know the only breakfast you can get on the Strip at noon is a pricey brunch?   Thank God for Yelp and feet--and a nice day. I donned my winter jacket and sneakers and walked the 4 miles to Egg & I.  There was still a wait at 1:15. They have a cool wait list that keeps you from being anxious, as you can monitor your own time and where you are in line. They have a cramped wait bench inside, and 3 benches on the porch.  They both call your name and text you when your table is ready.  The pictures make the food look hefty and bland, but it's actually delicious! The frozen cubed potatoes are fried nicely and tossed with seasoning salt, to wake up the flavor. The French Toast is just FT until you stuff it with yummy fluffy eggs/sausage/cheese mix. Stay with the regular maple syrup; it suffices.  I should have stayed with water, as the cranapple for $3 and 200 calories, I could have done without. But with 5 miles down (for calories) it's still a whole breakfast for $15. It cost at least that to walk into a fu-foo breakfast on the Strip.",

    "text": "While in Las Vegas for my mom's 70th, we wanted to have a hearty breakfast that wasn't buffet.  I remember hearing about this place from a friend so I decided this was the place to take my family.  May I say, nowadays I rarely give 5 stars because it means it is just impeccable.  This place is almost that level.  I cannot say it is 100% because the service could have been a little better.  Don't get me wrong, they were all very nice, I think we just had a server that was a little frazzled.  Other than that everything was perfect.    The restaurant is obviously off the strip, hence worth going to.  I think the prices were very reasonable for the amount of food and the quality of it too.  The restaurant is family friendly so good for all audiences.  They even have their own specialty which I will disclose in a bit.  As mentioned, the service was good, only because our server was a little overwhelmed, but when the other servers saw, they all helped out and got us what we needed.  The vibe was just awesome betweem staff and customers.  Let's get to the point...FOOOOD...here is what was on the menu:  Banana Nut Muffin:  this is their specialty!  It may not sound like much, but if you love banana nut muffins, you will find it hard to find something like this anywhere else.  Chicken Fried Steak: Two eggs any style with ranch potatoes and choice of toast or homemade banana nut muffin - perfectly crispy on the outside and juicy in the inside.  My two brothers had this with scramble eggs which were cooked perfectly.  The country gravy they had on top was just YUM.  Have Patience Please: Four eggs, with sliced chicken, fresh broccoli, sliced mushrooms and a blend of cheeses, ranch potatoes and choice of toast or homemade banana nut muffin - my mom had this with a side of fruit instead of toast.  It was really goos and super big.  It was way too much for one person but totally worth the buy  Steak and Eggs: Served with ranch potatoes and choice of toast or banana nut muffin - typical choice for my dad, meat and eggs.  He asked for it rare and guess what...it actually came out rare!  The quality of the steak was very good.  Not like the cheap ones you get at other places (who shall not be named).    Strawberry Cream French Toast: Two pieces of French toast stuffed with a delicious strawberry cream cheese filling then topped with a strawberry sauce and whipped cream and served with warm syrup - okay this was my order and I have to say....sooooooo good.  Their strawberry cream cheese filling was so tasy, light but enough to jolt the taste bud senses.  I ended up getting a side of eggs and extra crispy bacon and this came out just perfect  Loco Moco:  I don't remember if it was called this but that is exactly what is was.  They do it 2 styles, one with country gravy and one with the original brouwn gravy.  It is basically rice on the bottom with a meat patty smothered with either gravy and a fried egg on top.  This was actually pretty awesome considering this is not a hawaiian place.  They did well on the sauce,  my sister was impressed.  Bacon, Avocado and Cheese: A bacon omelette stuffed with sliced avocado and topped with cheese and a dollop of sour cream - my hubby had this and said is was delish.  They really filled it up throughout the whole omelet and they let him get a side of fruit instead of toast.  Overall I would definitely come back.  I suggest people to try it out too.  It does get very busy so go early if you are in a big group.",

Really nice staff, good atmosphere and portions that don't leave you feeling like a stuffed pig. Sorry if that is your preference. I personally hate food waste. Discovered the place on Yelp which suggests to me that the app might just still be working. Ate once inside and the second on the outside\"pet friendly\" patio. I'm pretty sure I will be back and hopefully I will NOT order the same thing again; because that \"just would be right!\" [Insert smart ass smiley face here] Peace/Out",

They have a lot of options and vegetarians too so check out the menu!   Price is about comparable to Denny's or IHOP.   I ordered chile relleno omelet with banana but bread and the hubby got 'the works,' with toast. We enjoyed our food and both finished it in no time.   Will definitely come back.

The menu is huge, and a little confusing, as the staples are towards the back (eggs, pancakes and waffles) while they seem to push several styles of eggs Benedict and four-egg omelettes (not a fan, blech.)  Service was what I expect from a half-decent diner - fast and punctual.  My waffle was not served with real maple syrup, which was a major bummer.  The potatoes that are included with the standard egg breakfast were small squares but were cooked perfectly and tasted a lot like French fries from Fuddruckers (heavy on the Thyme, which gives them a reddish, golden-brown color.) There's a little stand at the table with two metal egg badges. The first, in black, is a happy egg face which states to the wait staff that all is well.  The second is an egg-face in bright yellow with a somewhat consternated egg-face which signifies to the wait staff that you're either unhappy with the meal, but mostly tells them you need something.  I was in a particularly crappy mood, so I kept flipping the egg-face to the bright yellow unhappy egg-face, and the waitress was getting perturbed with me.  The turkey sausage was pretty tasty, so I'd recommend people order it if they decide to eat here.  In general, take it or leave it.",

    "text": "Been coming here for the past couple of summers, at least twice a week.  Considering that I'm only awake these 'early' hours (the place is only open from 6am to 3pm) a few times a week, that's a fairly high ratio, now that I think about it.  Menu items of note: Crazy Chicken - simply a well balanced omelette  Eggs Benedict Florentine - not a fan of eggs benedict in general, but I am when I come here  Banana Nut Muffin - this thing might be enough of a reason to come here just by itself  Haole (sp?) loco - on the back page, under the Hawaiian section, it's one of the more fattening things on the menu, but very tasty.  Not a fan of their homefries, so I substitute them out with fruit instead  Service: The servers are usually quite friendly, helpful, and attentive.  Reasons why I come here: This is one of the cheaper and healthier breakfast options in Vegas, yet there is no sacrifice in quality for the food.  Much better than the overrated Hash House a Go Go.  Oh, and if you are coming here for the first time, do yourself a favor and get the darn Banana Nut Muffin.",

I opted for the bacon and onion skillet, figured that's not something I make at home. YUM! I thought the ranch potatoes were slightly salty but could be because I've been lowering my salt intake lately.  The husband opted for the bandito omelette with the banana nut muffin (which was delicious!). He did not leave hungry.  Large servings, fast service, delicious food and nice atmosphere. We left satisfied and glad we found this place on Yelp.",

Sooo glad we did, because 1, they weren't as big as we thought they'd be, and 2, those suckers are really tasty.  The stuffed french toast is to die for.  Seriously, I think it'll kill you with all the meat, cheese and butter they manage to stick in there, but it's definitely worth the extra trips to the gym to work it off.  It's a pretty huge portion when you add in the home fries. The previous reviewer that said that it looks like somebody dumped a bottle of Lawry's seasoning on them wasn't kidding. They were orange.  SO got the Mexican Omelette and she couldn't finish it because of the generous portion size, but she enjoyed what she was able to put away. We both enjoyed the fresh squeezed orange juice.  There's nothing like seeing some honest elbow greased pulp in your juice to let you know it's the real deal.  Great service, friendly atmosphere, plenty of parking.  We'll definitely drop by when we're in the area again.",

It was packed with a line out the door on the Saturday morning we went.  I was able to try the combo meat skillet, beef hash skillet, and the stuffed french toast. Everything tasted homemade which places it above chain breakfast restaurants, but I think all cities have some sort of a joint that serves similar tasting dishes.  One thing that stood out was their banana nut muffin. Choose it over the toast, when asked what you prefer. This was the only thing that was better than anywhere else I have tried. I'm not a big fan of BNut, but if it tasted like the ones here, I would choose it every time.  Decent breakfast joint, decent prices. I might hit it again to try out different dishes to see if anything that can knock my socks off.",

The menu is pretty huge and I had a hard time deciding what to get. I ordered the Fiesta Skillet with chorizo. The eggs were really good, but the chorizo left something to be desired. It probably wasn't the best item on the menu, but this particular morning I was feeling something Mexican inspired. The ranch potatoes were great, like little cubes of goodness.  And yes, the banana nut muffin is as good as everyone says it is.  Come here if you're looking for good breakfast with generous portions at a decent price.

I was thinking about going to Ellis Islands for their $6.99 steak and eggs, then I changed my mind thinking about dealing with the strip crowd. The best advantage I always have in Vegas is my own car, and my own GPS. I can have the same options as a local.   This place is a Zagat rated breakfast joint. The food did not disappoint either. I tried out their waffle plate which came with 2 eggs and a large slice of ham or sausage. The waffle could've been a little warmer, but it tasted wonderful. $2.25 for all you can drink coffee has Starbucks beat. This was the perfect place for my stomach to get all that alcohol soaked up and out of my system for the long drive home. I now have a new off the strip favorite breakfast spot.",

Sorry no dancing ghetto looking dancing Despicable Me minions or card slappin' faux-porn peddlin' hombres here. What you will get though are those amazing banana nut muffins. The spinach benny I had was my saving grace, I doused it in hot sauce and devoured it Melissa McCarthy style. The waitress gives you your own container of coffee to refill your own mug instead of having to wait for her to come back. Jesus H. who does that anymore!!?? It's such a simple but awesome concept!

Overall it was a good experience, but we'll see the if we come here a third time or not...",

The most impressive attribute I found was the staff seemed so happy, positive and upbeat!   Judging from the level of activity, this place does a great deal of business and I wish them the best. For some constructive criticism ..... investing in some better quality flatware will elevate the perception of quality and will do much in justifying the relatively high prices.",

The atmosphere was upbeat and inviting. The menu was an adorable newspaper that was almost like reading the funny section of the Sunday news. Portion sizes were phenomenal and the kids menu offered variety and portions were like mini adult selections. My 9 year old loved it. My husband and I ordered the Cabo and Santa Cruz breakfast burritos with the works potatoes. We were reassured by the wait staff that it was pure deliciousness and it was! Our burritos were made up of four scrambled eggs,  sauteed bell peppers and onions, cheddar cheese,  chorizo, wrapped in a warm flour tortilla and topped with their signature Santa Cruz sauce & a dollop of sour cream. My 12 year-old decided to be adventurous and order the stuffed french toast, stuffed with scrambled eggs, sausage and sprinkled with powered sugar with warm maple syrup on the side. Definitely, a taste bud explosion. Thank you Egg & I...we will NOT forget you!",

But like everyone says, the line goes really quickly and I think we were seated within 15-20 minutes, which is not bad considering it was a Saturday at peak brunch time.    I loved their newspaper style menus and all the great descriptions to help decide what to order.  First thing I have to mention is the banana nut muffin.  Yes, I know everyone mentions it but it is SO worth mentioning!  It's so moist and delicious, I actually now crave the darn thing!    I ordered a corned beef hash with eggs and instead of their potatoes, I ordered rice.  The corned beef hash was okay, I like mine on the crispier side but it was still good.  The eggs were cooked perfectly.  Not too many places can make the perfect over-medium where it's a little cooked but just enough runnyness to get some yolk without it spewing all over the plate like an over-easy.  I tried my girlfriend's potatoes and should've stuck with it.  It was almost like little bites of french fries.  SO delicious!  I'm definitely heading back there next chance I get to, until then, I shall see the banana nut muffin in my dreams...",

They place was way over staffed with servers, which gave them time to just gather and gossip.   There were other employees enjoying their breakfast at the tables beside us.  Learned that Saturday is the best day for them tip wise (about $140), and other days are about $70; in case you wanted that info. One of the other employees came over and asked the manager what she was supposed to do because the employees were sitting at \"her tables\". She was rude, cursed, it was odd.   They could probably cut the staff in half and increase productivity and be better off.  Anyways, the banana muffin was delicious! The eggs and bacon were good. I didn't care for the potatoes, they just load them with seasoning salt.  My husband had the stuffed French toast, which was delicious.  I doubt we will be back.",

We arrived on a Thursday morning, and had no problems getting in; however,  from what I have heard about the weekend... it's standing room only. If I am in the Vegas area again, I definitely would recommend coming here for breakfast, but maybe not on the weekend.... i.e. you don't mind waiting. It's that good!!",

    "text": "When you have a big family staying at one of the resorts off the strip, you know how expensive cost of food to feed a big family can be. Luckily, we had a car and driving here was maybe 15 minutes to our hotel. The drive here was fairly easy and the parking is plenty at this location. We didn't wait long for a table for 6. Our server came pretty quick and took our order. The menu is fairly big but we all found something to eat. They have short menu for kids meal but there is nothing you can go wrong with making Mickey pancakes. What kid wouldn't care for Mickey? Lol. The pancakes are a bit dry though but slather with butter, it fixes the problem. The homemade corn beef hash was quite good. A little salty but with the egg, it balanced out. Omelettes here are layered with cheese and though some would be good but I had to remove a lot of it off. My Denver omelette did not have much taste but ketchup solves all things. The whole table did enjoy their banana muffin. That was very good. Service was good and the prices are way much better than at the resorts. If you're willing to drive out, this place is good for breakfast. It gets busy but if you go before 10, less crowded.",

Their menu has a wide variety of choices that you can choose from. But whatever you order, make sure that you get the banana nut muffin.  1. Sundance Omelette: It's the ultimate healthy veggie omelette. With feta cheese, spinach, tomatoes, and other deliciousness. I really liked the omelette. It comes with potatoes and your choice of toast or muffin. Get the muffin! All plates are pretty hearty, so this choice makes me feel less guilty of eating a lot of food haha (5/5)  2. Cordon Bleu Skillet: Comes with seasoned chicken breast, diced ham, swiss cheese and delicious potatoes. This one tastes great with easy over eggs. Very flavorful and savory. Overall, a great one to choose from (5/5)  The service here is friendly. Prices are reasonable as the portion sizes here are HUGE. Credit cards accepted. Plenty of parking.",

The service is friendly, like most locals spots in Las Vegas. despite showing up on a Sunday Morning at 10:30 our wait for a party of 5 was only 20 min. The server was with us quickly and the food hit the table shortly after that. they have a ton of televisions around the main dinner so you can catch the get as you grab brunch.   The pork chops were good, as we're the potatoes and eggs. I would say I've had better, and like I said up top, breakfast in this city is no joke. if not for the limited wait despite the busy morning and the amazing service I'd probably be dropping a star on the Egg & I.   side note, they sell the hot sauce they have on the table. The hot sauce is great.",

I had an egg-crepe with mushrooms, bacon, and cheese- breakfast potatoes and banana bread sides. Although I wasn't impressed with the \"crepe\", it wasn't the fault of the cooks. The eggs came out perfectly cooked and of course I polished off every morsel of fried potato on the plate and considered picking a couple cold ones off the floor that have been there since we stopped in. YES- THAT GOOD! So back to the crepe, it was like trying olives for the first time in a restaurant and deciding you don't like olives. It's not their fault you don't like olives.. I don't like egg-crepes.  The banana nut muffin.. Oh man.. Would it be terrible to walk in there and order a loaf of banana bread and just eat it all for breakfast? Probably for your arteries, yes- but it's damn good for the soul.  Everything here is delicious. EVERYTHING!",

Eggs are featured on everything from their tableware, to their menu, and their walls. It's too adorable. The menu looks like a real newspaper which is also a nice little touch to the theme of this restaurant. Bright yellow everywhere is a great way to brighten up and start your day in Vegas!  We went to Egg & I for brunch and I can say it loud and proud, this is the best American breakfast I have ever had. Hearty, filling, innovative, more than just eggs and waffles. Egg & I has taken breakfast foods to a whole different level. I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine (featured on Rachel Ray) which had  spinach, canadian bacon, two poached eggs on a grilled english muffin, with hollandaise sauce. We also ordered an omelette, Both served with ranch potatoes...by far the best breakfast potatoes on this planet. I forgot the name of the omelette, but I know for sure I'd order the eggs benedict florentine and extra banana nut muffins on the side. The complimentary banana nut muffins are made fresh in house, and they are SO GOOD. The service was just as bubbly and friendly as this restaurant is. If you want to start your day right in Vegas, this is definitely one of your options.  The lasting impression? \"Love my breakfast, let's get it on country style at Egg & I!\"",

Had a BLT with their home fries. It was average.   To read some of the review here you'd think this place was heaven on earth. I'm here to say that the food was just okay. When you calculate in the above average prices then this isn't a very good value in my opinion.   The service, on the other hand, was very good. Staff was great.",

I watched her explain items to us, as well as others.  She was very attentive and personable.   The only issues I would have are these.  1) I wanted a pancake and they only have large portions and no option for a single normal pancake to add to the side of a large omlet.  2) the potatoes were very salty...tasty...but too salty.  I don't mind a bit odd salt or spuce...but these were over the top with salt.  Great place for a nice breakfast.  Give Staci the trip to Disneyland!",

But the staff (hostess & other servers) who werent busy didn't bother to offer help and we sat asking and missing a few items...too often for my liking.  The location is about 2 miles away from the Hilton Grand Vacation Suites, which is where we stay always, great location right off of Sahara Ave. The decor is super cute, a bit country, yet not overwhelming and suffocating. There is an outdoor dining patio, it does face the busy street, but it was quiet. Surprisingly.  The food is great, fresh, came out hot and the coffee is good. A great variety of breakfast and lunch items, and I am looking forward to going back because as i said, slow service but great food. Good tasting. Fair prices. Liked this joint  Gave the 3 stars for the poor service and time we spent there despite non busy employees piddling around.  Has a large tv in the dining area, up high enough that you are not distracted if you choose not to watch. We were able to watch a bit of the World cup Soccer match, great in my opinion.",

We were immediately seated, no waiting. Wait staff were prompt and friendly, however, not very efficient. I noticed on 4 different occasions of them taking food orders to incorrect tables. Aside from that the food was awesome. The wife and I both had breakfast skillets, they were cooked perfectly and portions were spot on. We left full and happy!  For our sunday visit, we showed up closer to 11am. Told the wait was about 25mins, which it was. Staff were friendly and appeared to be much more efficient this visit. The wife ordered breakfast, Chicken Fried Steak and it was very delicious! I had the beef dip, which was average at best. The beef and au jus just didn't have enough flavor and the fries were soggy. So, I'd say 3 stars this visit, close to 5 the first, would be an easy 4 overall.  On sunday this place was literally a zoo, people packed everywhere, kids screaming/crying, rude people in the parking lot. I'd rx going early to avoid the rush if you are the type of person that gets anxious easily.",

I'm really picky about eggs benedict and theirs did not disappoint. I had the prime rib benny and highly recommend it, came on a croissant. We were planning on ordering a carrot cake to go and when they were out of it they gave us a loaf of carrot cake on the house - it's gestures like that that make all the difference. Great place and will definitely be returning. They're doing it right :)",

Also ordered the chocolate chip pancakes which were pretty good.  Orange juice and coffee to drown it all down.  The only thing I would say is the lack of service hospitality.  Waitress did not provide utensils and did not serve us the right amount of cups of water as ordered.  The hostess blurted out the WIFI password when I had asked but did not give me the proper spelling, therefore, I could not ascertain the service.  Food is good but service could be a bit better.

Although it was super busy, our server Ashley picked up on things we were mumbling to ourselves, thinking she would ignore us like any other server would on a busy day but she didn't, and got our request right away, which was nice.   I got the Sunrise Mountain which was eggs, cheese, a choice of meat on top of a fluffy croissant. Served with their delicious seasoned potato bits! Yum! Definitely recommend this one if you love cheese an eggs! It is also a very reasonable price and perfect portions.  I'm definitely going to return for breakfast when I'm in Vegas!",

I had the Country Fried Steak with 2 sunnyside up's, and polished almost everything except a small portion of the potatoes. If I had to point out anything, I would wish for some veggies on the plate. Otherwise it's great! Also, don't miss out on the banana nut muffin! Our server was Carole Ann, and she made sure we were great throughout the whole meal!",

I suggest going with American dishes because there is no authenticity to any Mexican dishes. Stay away from the rice and beans, they are better at Taco Bell.  The salsa was nothing special either.",

The service is amazing and welcoming, the food is really good, and the feeling after the meal, it's worth every calorie.    Con: The wait to get in, the wait to pay.....FOREVERRRRRRR!!!!!!!! wish they had a better system to deal with paying the bill.  Once you finish, you are given the bill and you have to pay as you leave.  However, if multiple people are leaving at once, it's a long wait.  Not a good thing to go through with a very full stomach. hahaha",

Since it's a locals place, it gets pretty crowded, so don't come thinking you're not going to have to wait a bit before getting a seat.  It's totally worth it.  Located right off the strip, it's a great place to grab a bite to eat without hassling with the nearby hotels.  The prices are reasonable and they have a huge menu to choose from.  Even the pickiest of eaters have something to pick, no matter how difficult they might be.  It's a country style restaurant with a variety of egg dishes.  My favorite is the Eggs Benedict.  The hollandaise sauce is creamy and perfect and it's paired with some seasoned potatoes.  I like them, but they aren't my favorite.  Their biscuits and gravy are pretty awesome as well. A great dish to serve with the table, but if you're starving, you might want to try to conquer them by yourself.",

    "text": "Not sure what all the high reviews on this place is about. This is your standard ordinary breakfast place. The service is excellent, very friendly and nice waitresses. The menu is great, lots of variety to choose from. But the food was just average. I was really disappointed in my bacon and avocado omelette. I thought they seriously forgot to add the bacon. I dug through the omelette for it and finally saw tiny small crumbles of it in there. The egg was thick and dry and the only good thing about it was the avocado chunks inside. Big pieces of avocado. That's IT.  The potatoes it came with were not good. Just deep fried potatoes. The side of fruit was much better. The corned beef hash was mushy and had a lot of potatoes. Was disappointed in that too. Why the heck all the stars, yelpers??  Ok ok, the muffin was probably the best part. They give you choice of toast or muffin. Get the muffin!",

I recommend the country fried steak on skillet with fries and potato omelette. It literally melts in your mouth with all the happiness you can give to your tummy. its a baby friendly environment. But!!!! One thing It is a pretty heavy high calorie meal so be prepared. Must try!!! I will definitely come back whenever I visit Vegas for any reasons! :)",

He got the chicken fried steak, which was good, and I got some chicken, mushroom, avocado omelet with added spinach. I loved all the avocado in it, but there was something lacking in flavor. Also, there was way too much cheese. I love cheese, so for me to say that, it's a big thing. Also, I wasn't a fan of the salty seasoning on the potatoes. I wish there was less of it, or none of all.

Hubby had the chicken fried steak skillet, kid had the chicken fried steak with extra gravy and I opted for the corned beef hash with eggs over easy. None of us were fans of the potatoes, over seasoned and very salty. Both guys said the gravy had kind of the same seasoning too it. Corned beef hash was flavorless and the eggs were a bit overdone.

Lo and behold our waitress (Paula) came through to save the day in the service department. She was great from the get go and stayed consistent providing excellent comfortable service that you'd want to get from a breakfast spot after a looooong night out.  Food:  The Check-In Muffin: Meh, nothing great. I'm a big carrot raisin muffin person and this was okay. Complimentary so am I allowed to give it a 2/5?   The Big Omelette: If it's not called that then it's some synonym of the word big. How impressive can an omelette be? Order this and you'll find out. The way that the ingredients are actually layered in between the eggs is a unique alternative to the usual blanket style omelette. Ingredients a plus. 4.75/5  Potatoes: These need a review of their own. Eggs and I let me know I was not crazy for expecting good side breakfast potatoes everywhere else where I've had them. The seasoning extraordinary...cooked to perfection..add a little catsup and you've got the best potatoes I have ever had at breakfast. 5/5  French Toast: I got hit with an avalanche off the high that I was on. There was something wrong with these. Not so the taste but more of the texture. Even the berries and the whip could not save these. 2/5  Orange Juice Carafe: It seems bottomless for two, good deal, good taste. Freshly squeezed I think. 4/5  Not disappointed with my meal here. The hostess and the french toast need to be reworked a little, get her to shadow Paula and steal Blu Jam's recipe, maybe?  Oh yeah, the salsa :/ taste like taco bell sauce but does not come with a witty packet message",

We were afraid it would be too sweet and overwhelming, but since you can just dip the French toast in the maple spread (it's not actually stuffed) and syrup it's just enough! Highly recommend splitting this with someone! We split that and the bacon, avocado omelet with potatoes which was also great. Portions are healthy and prices are very reasonable.

Not this salsa, it was yummy and I'd love to have taken it home with me. My burrito came with beans and rice which were ok but the burrito was huge so I couldn't eat everything anyways. I'd highly recommend giving them a try, it's a bit of a drive off the strip but we'll definitely be back our next visit to Vegas!",

Our nice and kind waitress was Karla. She was super sweet and friendly. I ordered an orange juice and the island style plate which consisted of choice of spam or Portuguese sausage. I went with spam, eggs over easy and came with two scoops of white rice. The most simple breakfast I have had. It fulfilled my cravings for spam. I love fried spam. I literally scarfed my food down because I was so hungry. I accidentally tipped my orange juice on the table and Karla kindly cleaned it up and gave me a new orange juice. Thanks Karla!   Service was excellent by our waitress Karla and the rest of their crew that works for them! I even got to sample the potatoes and corn beef hash and it was fresh and delicious! I definitely loved the breakfast. My daughter had fruit loops cereal and a muffin. Each of us received a chocolate muffin. This was hot and delicious. Very moist. So glad we came here. Definitely worth it!",

Evelyn let us try a banana-nut muffin ... I want the recipe. We split a meal (which was more than enough food) --it was a breakfast burrito, which tasted like a flavor explosion -- and paid under 12 bucks. I highly recommend this place. Great service and great food!",

The variety of food and the service totally blows my mind.  Our server was very nice and informative. She gives us her honest opinions when we ask which of the loco moco we should try. Instead of harming business, I think this is a good practice. To be able to know what the insider thinks...  The banana muffin.... speechless. Out of this world good. Still ooey gooey and warm out of oven. New guest should make sure to take advantage of the free muffin for yelp check in.   Enough said... just visit. U r not going to regret it.",

    "text": "we were in vegas this past weekend for a very short trip. of course there are bazillion places to eat on the strip, but i wanted to check out some place off strip, to get away from the craziness of driving in bumper to bumper traffic, waiting for tons of people to cross the streets and then to wait to eat.   Egg & I is located off strip, east of the 15 off of the sahara exit. its located in a strip mall with plenty of parking. there is indoor and outdoor seating. there were a few people waiting when we arrived but we were quickly seated. the place was full with a few tables empty. we were expecting to wait but it was already about 10AM by the time we went.   i ordered the strawberry and cream french toast which was thick slices of soft french toast with a strawberry whipped cream cheese and strawberry preserves on top. it was pretty good. i liked that it wasnt too sweet like most french toast/waffles with fruit toppings at other restaurants.  the bf ordered the fiesta skillet with chorizo. it had green chili, onions and salsa. i thought it was gonna be sausage type of chorizo but it was the ground kind. if you've ever cooked or bought it at the market you know what im talking about. when you cook it, it pretty much just melts. so the skillet was as if it had chili on top. it was pretty heavy and greasy. i could probably do without the chorizo next time.  the bfs bro ordered the country fried steak skillet. this had chopped chunks of country fried steak with their homestyle potatoes and eggs with white gravy on top. it was pretty good. it tasted just like a regular country fried steak plate but all chopped up for you, if you dont mind your food touching (i know some people who dont, like my 5 yr old nephew...).  bfs bro's fiance ordered the stuffed french toast. this was two pieces of their thick sliced fluffy french toast with an omelet in between. the eggs had lots of bits of bacon in it which made it tasty but it was pretty firm. i felt like it was over cooked. maybe it was all the cheese. it tasted good though. it tasted good with either the syrup and/or ketchup. sweet or savory, whichever you prefer.   we had also had a side of the banana nut muffin, which was pretty good. it was large on top. it wasnt too sweet which was nice. it came out moist and warm. yum!  the service was good. everyone was pretty friendly and the food came out fast. we had ordered coffee and they gave us a pitcher of coffee. they take credit card but you have to show your ID and pay at the front.",

Located in a plaza with other businesses and there is plenty of parking.    I ordered the new york steak and eggs.  Steak was tender and juicy.  Eggs were cooked perfectly.  Served with country ranch potatoes.  The country potatoes are basically small fried potatoes squares with ranch seasoning.  My GF had the cajun shrimp eggs benedict special.  The fresh fruit plate contains blueberries, madarin oranges, pineapple, cantaloupe, and honeydew slices.  Fruits were fresh and it was a great way to start off the morning.  Expect to wait a few minutes if you have a party larger than 2.  Luckily it was just me and my GF and we were seated right when we arrived.  The staff were fast, friendly, courteous, and they were as accommodating as much as possible.  Egg & I, you guys are now one of my favorite breakfast / lunch places to visit when I am around the Las Vegas Area.  Thank you for the great meal.  Bon Apettit",

Even though it is not on the menu, you can design your own omelette.  so I designed one just for me, I asked for fruit rather than potatoes no extra charge to change the sides the fruit was amazing -big pieces of  pineapple, orange, grapefruit, watermelon, canteloupe and honeydew.  Everything was yummy including the home made Banana Nut Muffins and we took a few to go.  Good place for breakfast, nice menu selection and Carole Ann was a great waitress.  The total cost including two breakfasts, 3 muffins to go, 2 hot teas, = $31.00 with tax & tip.  Very good breakfast & service.",

We were seated about 20 minutes after I checked in , that was no problem, you were busy and it was just before lunch time, we had a table outside at the far end , it started out good , as we placed our 2 orders a group of 6 were seated at the next table , the waiter (did not catch his name) went and got us water , then he went to the 6 and got them all water , and took orders , we had ordered at least 5 minutes before this , then after a bit of time the 6 people were served Bloody Mary's just before they were served their meals , we were still waiting, our meals arrived about 5 minutes later . This was a bit irritating because I felt that our order was pushed behind others , we had simple meals , this delay should not have been a complicated prep time, I had the beef dip and my partner had a burger covered in chili, our meals were good as usual , but not real hot , they were both medium warm , not really enough to make the meals bad . The problem I had was the delay while a 6 people table got cocktails and their meals while we waited . This was the reason for the yelp rating . We usually frequent your restaurant at sunset and eastern , never had this happen before .  If you wish further information you can contact me via my email @. Rockym1212@gmail .com Thank you , Michael",

    "text": "Egg & I is part of a chain family of restaurants here in Vegas, and well worth a visit. This review is for breakfast.  Food: The chicken fried steak was nicely fried with a light batter. I had my gravy on the side, and it was rich, creamy, and flavorful. Eggs were cooked as requested. The potatoes were a little too overwhelming and powdery with the spice they use on them, but otherwise were cooked well and in bite sizes. The stuffed French toast was filled with sausage, egg, and cheese. If yuh don't mind your sweet and savory mixing, this is for you. French toast had a soft center and slightly crunchy exterior.   Service: They know how to turn tables here on a busy Sunday. Staff were friendly and efficient. They have a sign on the table that guests may use to call for service, or note they are OK. Water gets refilled often, and coffee comes in a pot, so you may top up when you need to. They even brought flavored creamer out.   Cost: Two breakfast meals, a coffee, and an ice tea ran us about $34 after tax.   Overall: Great local spot. In a strip mall, so plenty of parking. Worth a try. They take cards. And if you check in using Yelp!, you have the option of getting an extra banana muffin each person. Bonus!",

I feel like it's important to say that even though it's a million degrees outside, they have water misters. I loved the egg flip notifications on the table-- a great way to get the servers attention. It reminded me a lot of a NJ diner. Our server's name was Lacey and she was very sweet!   I immediately loved the complimentary banana nut muffin that came with the meal (shout-out to yelp!). The menu was EXTENSIVE which I totally appreciated. I didn't even know where to start!! We ordered the Hawaiian french toast combo and the stuffed french toast. I honestly was disappointed in my French toast residually from the reviews I saw on here. I expected it to take like hawaain sweet bread but instead it tasted like plain french toast; still good but I would've ordered something different if I knew. The stuffed french toast on the other hand was absolutely yummy. It has cheese, sausage, and eggs with some seasoned potatoes. I would come back again to try another egg treat off the menu especially because it's so budget friendly for the area with pretty great service. But I definitely wouldn't get the French toast.",

It was clearly packed with locals which is important in a place like Vegas were they have a ton of options.  Servers were friendly, food was fresh, and left us both full. It's everything you could want in a breakfast joint.   Husband got the three piggy omelet, I got French toast, and neither of us was disappointed.  Prices were really shockingly low (compared to the strip) and about what we'd pay at our local joint in San Diego.    If you have the choice, drive off the strip and head here. Don't let the lines scare you and enjoy watching the train.",

They have that family-owned/operated vibe, super friendly and attentive service (despite being crazy busy), and of course, food that is out of this world good.   We waited about 15 minutes for a table for two on a Thursday morning around brunch time. I would suggest looking at the menu in advance (you can find photos on Yelp) if you're in a hurry as their menu is extensive.   I did the Yelp check-in for a free banana nut muffin and it was SO worth it! It was served warm and almost melted in my mouth. Definitely less dense than a typical banana nut bread or muffin.   I had a breakfast tostada with carnitas for my meal. The pork was juicy and flavorful, and the combination of that and the other ingredients was perfect. Their breakfast potatoes are really crispy and well-seasoned. I tried my best but couldn't finish it. The portions here are generous to say the least.   The other person I dined with had the maple bacon cream French toast which I tried- WOW. Super rich but the salty/sweet combo is to die for. She also got the bacon and onion skillet which looked good, too.   Prices are reasonable considering the quality and quantity. This is a WAY better bang for your buck than eating breakfast/brunch anywhere on the Strip.   I'm coming back the next time I'm in Vegas!",

The outdoor look is pretty simple, with no extra fluff. We were immediately seated, served coffee and we ordered works veggie Bennie and biscuits. You are given an options of fruits or potatoes. We then planned on ordering carrot cake french toast. The server was kind enough and I repeat nice to tell us the portions were huge and she would wait on the carrot cake order. I love food, but I hate wastage and I TOTALLY appreciate the heads up. The eggs were flawless, hollansauce 5/5 and potatoes for my spouse were crisp and spiced well. We were so full, we ended up canceling the carrot cake.  All in all thoroughly enjoyed the breakfast, loved the ambience inside (there's a little handmade train that runs above on a track - its cute!) totally worth our money and absolutely worthy for the food. Not on the strip, so no traffic and no parking hassles. 5/5 ---- 2nd visit.  Added the carrot cake french toast to our previous orders. We came back cause we loved the food so much. The carrot cake was just fine, just tasted like carrot cake. I was expecting a twist since it was a french toast version. Nothing out of the box. Not unhappy, but not elated either",

Perfect ratio of fillings without being too rich or greasy. The potatoes were also on point; I loved their spice.   Even though there's a lot done to minimize contact with your server (e.g., mini kiosks for payment at each table), my waitress did a good job making sure I had everything I needed.

Everyone ordered a little bit of the menu -- I personally ordered a banana muffin and prime rib Benedict which came beautifully plated in a cast iron skillet. The banana nut muffin was moist, gooey, and flavorful -- tasting like a smoother homemade banana bread. The prime rib skillet itself was beautifully plated with perfectly poached eggs, hollandaise, croissant on the bottom. The meat was tender but had a strange flavor (did not taste like a blackening seasoning, but maybe it was just my palate). The skillet potatoes were a bit over seasoned too for my liking. Nevertheless, I'd say the overall execution of the meal was pretty well done for a breakfast spot!  Service was prompt and reasonably attentive considering the crowd. Also loved the self-pay kiosks at the table!",

I ordered their chiles rellenos omelet, served with diablo seasoned potatoes and choice of bread. The omelet was a good, not too spicy, made with 4 eggs. I asked for my potatoes to be lightly seasoned, and it had good flavor, slightly crisp, and soft inside. The others at the table had it seasoned as is, and it became too salty after a while. Husband ordered blueberry pancakes. They were nice and fluffy, but i thought they tasted a bit average. I also received a free banana bread muffin for checking in here on yelp.

Lacey was a great server, she came at the perfect times to check up on us, always refilled our drinks and made sure we were well taken care of. I requested avocado toast even though I didn't see it on their menu but she was so willing to accommodate my request. A1 food and service!",

Large slices of sweet watermelon, cantaloupe, honey dew, pineapple, orange, and grapefruit. It could have been a meal in itself. Don't forget to order some banana muffins, warm and delicious.",

Smoked chicken and chorizo hash was an unattractive pile of overwhelmingly salty non distinctive mush. Blackened prime rib Benedict wasn't really eaten by both adults either. Honestly, I pretty much had 1 bite of each and then ate the sourdough toast dipped in egg yolk.  I will totally admit that I think that we are spoiled Sonoma County foodies that have fresh and innovative food expectations. My tip: stick with the basics and remember it's reasonable diner type food in Vegas.  Love the carat of coffee that got refilled.",

So long story short we had a car appointment to get a nail taken out of our tire off Sahara, so while that was being done we decided we were hungry and that we would walk to the egg and I to get some breakfast.   It was about a mile and a half distance but no worries because we played Pokemon go the whole time, this was my first time at the egg and I so my first impression was it looked very homey (not a bad thing).   The server was very polite, we were sat immediately no appetizers we got straight to the point. I ordered a green enchilada burrito with cubed potatoes, my food was delicious as usual. my wife ordered Chile verde with an egg on top with toast.   Overall this was a nice experience the food and the service was very good and I'd definitely come back if I was in the area.   Keep up the good work egg and I.",

Today's late breakfast was the best service hands down. Earl was our server and I did double check the name since I suck at remembering. Me and a friend came to catch up on things and I recently recruited her to Yelp and had her check in. With the check in we each got the banana nut muffin. Which was a 5 out of 5 Yelp star rating. For breakfast I always stick to the basics so I usually always order \"the classic\". Which comes with eggs, one choice of meat (bacon, sausage and I must note each come in turkey too), potatoes & toast. My friend got the \"Country Benny\" which she was very pleased with. Earl checked on our table throughout our whole visit. Also, if you've been to any of the chain restaurants then you know they have this egg shaped smiley face that you can flip to a sad face to grab anyone's attention for service. Needless to say, we didn't have to use it. Oh and Earl kindly offered me each type of creamer they had for my coffee! So for the first time there I didn't have to have plan old half & half.   To top it off they gave us a military discount for my friends portion of the bill! They actually check ID with your credit cards too here!!! #WINNING  Thanks for the hospitality Earl!",

    "text": "Recommendation from my sister,  even though she's never been.  Went for breakfast in Saturday morning and it was a 15 min wait at 9:30 am.  Within 15 min the wait turned into 30-45 min wait.  So if you're going to check this place out come early.  First time?  No problem, you get a warm banana nut muffin. Regular, check in with yelp and get a free muffin. Lots to choose from. The portions are big enough that you can share with someone else.  Shane was our waiter ABC be was so nice! He recommended the rib eye benedict. So good!  It comes with home potatoes that are seasoned to perfection. The Mexican Crepe (made out of eggs) is pretty good to.  My boyfriend and I shared the rib eye benedict and the biscuits and gravy. Come on an empty stomach, trust me. Prices are reasonable and the staff is friendly and eager to make your experience a pleasant one.  This one is definitely going  in my book as one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas for breakfast!",

They called us back in only 10 min.  Tamara was there almost the second we sat down, took our drink order and then took our food order after the drinks arrived.  We have a certain combination of foods that we order that's not on the menu because we want healthy choices.  Tamara took our order and then subbed items out from their typical meal combination so that we didn't have to pay an upcharge for substituting eggs whites for eggs or fruit for potatoes.  As busy as they were, they accommodated us with efficiency & a smile.  Thank you Tamara & Egg & I for a delicious & wonderful breakfast every Saturday. From April & Joni.",

I was so excited to try it because we're never awake for normal breakfast time. They stop seating people at 3pm, which is when we usually get there.   The food is great. The chili relleno omelet was amazing. I'm not a fan of the ranch potatoes. I think they are a good filler though. Same about the Banana Nut Muffin. But the meal I dream about is Benedict's Garden. It's a 'vegetarian' version of eggs benedict. English muffin topped with guacamole and tomato, poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. it's the greatest thing!  Service is great. Everyone is friendly. Waitresses are attentive but If you need anything, just flip the egg on the condiment caddy.",

When we arrived the hostess seated us at a  with unraveled silverware and a five dollar bill still sitting on the table. She gave us our menu's and left the money awkwardly sitting there.   When we finally got to put in our orders our waitress recommended that we take a half portion of our cheese, egg and veggie skillet breakfast dish and I'm so glad she did. The half portion was like a full portion and I could barely finish it, as it had so much thick sticky cheese on top. Also, the seasoning that they put on the potatoes tastes exactly like Dorritos and I felt like I was eating potato chips (not in a good way).   Also I just wanted to note something that happened while were waiting for our food to come. The waitress hastily sat us at a 5 top (it was just my bf and I). A family of 5 came in about 10 minutes after us and she tried to sit them in the table next to us which could not accommodate anymore than 4 people. She grabbed a chair from our table to try and seat them there, but the family was really unhappy, it was especially awkward as we were sitting at the only table that could fit them. She then moved them somewhere to the other side of the room. I saw the family leave a few minutes later out of frustration.   The food is really just standard fare, nothing to write home about. On top of that it's incredibly unhealthy. I understand that Vegas has very little breakfast joints, but I would rather make my own omelet at home. Your health will be better for it.",

Muffin lived up to the hype in terms of taste, but not size. If we are talking about a life-changing muffin, it needs to be a little bigger. I wanted 2 of these.  Shoulda went with the crowd and got the Eggs-cellent Omelette. Kay's Special caught my eye cause it sounded like spinach artichoke dip but made into omelette form. It was really tasty but the 3 Eggs-cellent Omelettes at the table kept overshadowing my dish. But that was my fault and not the fault of Egg & I.   Potatoes were completely covered in a paprika type spice blend. It made them really dry. A good dousing of ketchup cured the dryness.  Overall your typical uber greasy breakfast that will make you feel ridiculously full all day long. The muffin made the experience above average.",

They have a huge menu and I want to come back many times to try all of the tasty-looking options.  I had a gigantic omelet full of avocado and bacon. It doesn't get any richer or more fattening than that but it's okay because there's no way I could have finished that thing (despite its yumminess). My husband got this ridiculous stuffed French toast monstrosity- stuffed not with marscapone cheese, or some fruity filling, or whatever else you'd expect French toast to be stuffed with, but with eggs and sausage! It was hugely filling but delicious.  They have good coffee, too, and the prices are right, and the heavily seasoned potatoes are probably loaded with sodium but who cares because they're delicious.",

    "text": "Mmmm, mmmm gewd!  Wake up before you get here.  Drink some caffeine, ride with the windows down, stick your head out the window with your tongue in the wind.  Come ready to read & eat because you have a massive book of a menu to study before making a tasty decision, which you really can't go wrong.  Everything is very good, but very different with generous blends of ingredients.  Def not your normal boring breakfast foods.  So, if you're not awake and not ready to study the menu, use the random decision making method by closing your eyes before opening the menu to a any page and ordering the first item your finger lands upon.  You always have the choice of warm, fresh banana nut muffin or toast.  Let me repeat -- warm, fresh banana nut muffin, ahhhhh.  Just about everything on the menu is served with their yummilicious ranch style potatoes.  My favorite thing here is the Pesto Scramble (4 eggs scrambled with sliced chicken, pesto, tomatoes, spinach, and feta cheese.)  My other favorite is when they have the Country Potato Soup special, which is a creamy potato soup topped with lots of chives and some bacon.   It's not a regular menu item.   The wait staff is consistently great.  Prices are great and portions are generous.  If you come on a weekend day come early or call first.  Sometimes there is quite a wait to be seated during late morning.",

The menu looks like a morning's newspaper, they have tons of yummy items to choose from. The trick to getting your waiter's attention: first you'd have to look at the smiley egg that holds the condiments on your table and when you flip the egg to a frown, you'll be serviced in no time. Unless they are super busy and most of the time they are so just wait patiently.   The food portion size is big, I would say that thee portion is adult men's size who is damn hungry in the morning because I never finish and always pack it home.  Every time I order unlimited coffee, it always taste old (drink @ your own risk) :\\ so I never get coffee unless I absolutely need it.   Overall, I love this place! Mainly I give them a 5 for the damn food...it's just too damn good.",

The place was jammed with a crowd outside when we came on a Sunday morning - but the wait was only 10 minutes and it was worth it. Food-wise the Fender Bender Egg Crepe was out of this world. (After I wrote the above, my girlfriend said \"Oh, I forgot to order fruit instead of home fries\" with her breakfast. The waitress of course said \"I can bring you fruit\" and didn't charge us for it. That's exactly what you would expect from a classy cool place like this. I made sure to Yelp it because we need more restaurants like this. And I repeat: every employee from the hostess to the waitress to the cashier was charming. Yes, yes, yes to the Egg and I.

My first meal was the Ultimate Skillet. Bring a large appetite! My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly and all the ingredients were so tasty and fresh. I also enjoyed their sourdough toast. It was thick, flavorful, and buttery! The dish was so yummy and substantial.  It kept me going until late in the afternoon. My wife had the Bacon, Avocado, & Cheese omelette. She loved it. It was cooked to perfection; a uniform yellow color and cooked evenly through.  It was loaded with lots of avocado.  She said that it was maybe the best she's ever had. Wow!  I had to cut back on my next visit. I ate too much on the first one, although I really enjoyed it (trying to be good in Vegas???). I ordered the Eggs-Plus with ham. The scrambled eggs were cooked just right.  The ham was good. It was not dry, chewy or too salty. The potatoes were also good. The server helped my wife make substitutions to the Flapper which made her her happy. Who says you can't have your cake and eat it too? She rated the pancakes 5 stars!   Another great breakfast.  I must commend the staff here. They are welcoming, friendly, and they are willing to accommodate you so that you are satisfied with your meal. I am looking forward to my next Vegas trip so that I can eat there again.",

The family and I were in Vegas to cash in on a Giants World Series bet.  I really didn't want the usual buffet, so we did a quick search on Yelp and off to the Egg and I we went.    We stepped in and were quickly seated.  The televisions on the wall was great.  I could see who was playing and not playing for that Sunday's Fantasy Football Lineups.  We ordered coffee and looked over the menu.  (Note- Coffee was ok.  Better than IHOP, but not my favorite blend.)   We looked over the menu and what a selection!  It took us awhile to figure out what we wanted.  I ordered the Egg-Ceptional Omelet, my wife ordered the Two-egger, and my son had the Chocolate Waffles.      The food quickly came out and as far as portions...  they were HUGE!  My wife's Two-egger was like 4 eggs.  My kid's waffles were shaped like Mickey Mouse, which was a nice touch.  My omelet was one of the biggest I've ever seen.  Our only problem was that the chocolate waffle was without chocolate.  We had them bring out some chocolate chips and all was well again.    The omelet and ranch spiced potatoes were yummy.  You could taste freshness of the ingredients.  The omelet had sausage, diced ham, bacon, onions, tomatoes, portabella mushrooms and melted cheese all topped with sour cream and green onions.       We finished all we could and off to gambling we went.",

Located in a strip mall with a lot of parking, there was no wait on a weekday morning, but the place was full of patrons. Took a while for our server to take our order and asked us twice what we wanted to drink (amnesia maybe ?..no she was just busy, trying to tend to everyone), so after about 10 minutes, my husband flipped the sign with the un-happy egg, to show we needed attention. The sweet lady at the register quickly came to us and asked what we needed. Our server quickly came to us and apologized for the wait and also brought each of us the BEST BANANA  NUT MUFFIN ever !!!   I had the Blackend Prime Rib Benny, A Grilled croissant with  prime rib, sauteed spinach and roasted red bell peppers, two poached eggs, then covered with hollandaise sauce. Also came with home fries and 2 slices of fruit. This dish was AMAZING ! All the flavors tied together so well and that Banana Nut Muffin will make me a return customer ! The hubby had Crepes filled w/ Mushrooms, that I take was also delicious, since  I didn't get to taste it !   The coupon for a \"buy one meal get the other for half off\" made the whole experience even better.   We'll be back in 2 mos..EGG AND I but this time we won't be alone.",

I have to go back and find out for sure, the waitress was busy, so I did not get the chance to ask about the bread.

The day before my lady had found a voucher in a tourist magazine together with the notion of a review that this place (i.e. both) we're very liked with the community and the reviewers, in fact best liked.  Being a no brainer it turned up trumps in reality: The place was VERY busy (which we took as a good sign to start with) yet being seated only took a moment and the service was very fast and attentive. Food variety on the menue is almost too big ;-) so I quite took my time to decide. Got an italian influenced omelette which turned out to be very tasty.  One more thing about the service: Our little boy didn't like his fries because they came spiced (paprika or the likes)... they were replaced with plain ones in no time - comped !  A little before the food arrived a nice and cheerful lady of the staff came over and chatted us up a bit. Her expert eye didn't fail to note that we were out-of-towners. Later, I found out that she was actually the manager (owner?) and had the same first name as my darling ! When she heard that I failed to order the banana nut muffin (house specialty) she had one sent to our table immediately - again, complementary !  I guess I don't need to say more. Prices very reasonable, yummy food with a lot of variety...wish we had breakfast places like that in Berlin lol.  Since I guess we will return to Las Vegas at some point in our lives I can clearly see us going there again !",

    "text": "Our meal at Egg & I was the saving grace of our Vegas trip. Although when we pulled up I was doubtful, I held faith in my Yelp brethren--and I'm so glad I did. We were seated immediately for a group of 5 at 1pm on a Sunday, but that was just luck as it was a full house.   The menu is huge and a little overwhelming because there are so many options, but I finally settled on the Huevos Rancheros with carnitas, both sauces, and breakfast potatoes. I also used the Yelp check-in for a free banana nut muffin, and she kindly brought one for each of us at the table! The muffin is so moist--we're talking stick to your fingers moist. Our meal came relatively quickly and there was silence among the table as we all dug in. The huevos rancheros were probably among the best I've ever had. It came with so much carnitas and melted cheese--it was exactly what we needed after two days of Vegas, if you catch my drift. I was wary of the breakfast potatoes initally; I'm a hash browns girl precisely because breakfast potatoes are often underseasoned. Not the case here in the slightest. Each nugget was a little crispy, but soft on the inside and packed tons of flavor. The portions are huge though, so keep in mind when you're ordering! I split the huevos rancheros and it was more than enough for two!  My friend got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were also very delicious, but super thick and rich so not what my dehydrated body was in the mood for. Gimme dat salt!  Right before we left we were commenting on how good the muffins were, and she brought us two to go in a box because they were about to close up for the day and they make them fresh every morning. I will definitely keep this place in mind next time I'm looking for brunch in Vegas!",

I was excited to pull up and see roughly 40 ppl waiting outside as that generally means deliciousness awairs. After a 20 minute wait,  my friend and I were sat in Amanda's section. Amanda was a very knowledgeable, amiable and capable waitress. She got our orders correct and our food came out promptly.   Speaking of food, I ordered the mashed potato omelette and my friend got the chicken fried steak skillet. Whoever though about putting garlic mash inside of a bacon omelette is a genius. Either that or they have grandmothers chained up in the back putting elbows and feet in the food. Absolutely amazing!! Will definitely come back when in the LV area.",

However, that is where the \"WOW\" factor ended for me.   Being from Hawaii, an order of the Loco Moco was placed, along with the Ranch Club.  The ground beef on the Loco Moco was hard and a bit bland. The Club was okay and unfortunately, the onion rings were average, at best, as I am used to panko onion rings which make it flaky crispy.  I can't say it was bad, but not what I had expected based on the reviews and the long line outside.",

Please dont share that. Get your own, damn it. Its too good to be shared!  Wait a minute! Did I say RANCH POTATOES???!!! OH HELL YEAH!!! Its the best tasting season potatoes ever! They are not like french fries nor tots but they are cubed shaped fries. I almost died when I put one in my mouth. This is why I scored this place a 5.   The potatoes and banana nut muffin totally suckered me in for life! I dont even like banana nut flavored anything or muffins and this muffin was the bomb!!!  My chicken fried steak was huge and just perfect. Its not oily at all, just plump and juicy.   5 star in my book. I think the service was good...I think the wait wasnt too bad... shit, I dont remember, I zoned out after my first bite of those delicious potato fries!",

They're not skimpy on their omelettes and pile on the Works potatoes, easy to split. Banana nut muffin is so moist, leaves you wanting more. The house special burrito, hubby says, is the perfect combo of egg, cheese, bacon, Works potatoes and green bell peppers that just melts in your mouth. Kid's meals were big too!  Most likely it's the workers who create such an inviting atmosphere here. To the corporate manager: Caresia should win the Disneyland trip because she was such a friendly server! She was still smiling as we made our mutiple requests.  Thank you Egg and I, our bellies are full!!",

The breakfasts were huge, I got the chicken omelette it was really tasty, a bit too many of the mini potatoes, would have been better to have more omelette but still plenty of food.  One of my kids got the chocolate chip pancakes and they were great!.  Also they had something for everyone, our youngest only wanted chicken fingers and French fries at 8:30am and they had it available.. My wife had the rancho scramble and it was amazing!

Of course I got the Chicken Fried Steak, but was met with resistance when trying to substitute a pancake for my choice of bread. I was told I could not substitute, even if paying an up charge, and would have to actually get an order of pancakes. This is the first time I have run into this problem. She also told us we could not get separate checks at the table and would have to take care of that at the register. This turned out to be a fustercluck and inconvenienced the customers behind us at the register. The CFS itself was good, as were the potatoes. The eggs were eggs. I was leaning towards two stars, but the quality of the food helped to compensate for the difficult waitress.",

Service was slow, we had to ask several times for some items. Not sure why this place gets so many stars.",

    "text": "Came here with friends while on vacation. I appreciate the choices in coffee creamers and the carafe being left of the table, which saves the hassle of tracking down a server for a refill when you've got a small cup o' joe. Good coffee, but I come here for the eggs.   I ordered the hash, but our table also ordered a pancake plate and a waffle works. The waffles look light and crisp, the pancakes are fluffy and have a variety of fillings (but I think we got charged a different-than-base-price for these, so ask or watch out? Our server suggested something after we handed over the menus), and the crispy little home fried potatoes are so tasty! (I got a half serving of these, half serving of fruit--which is plenty of both!) My hash was homemade and nothing like that cubed canned corned beef hash, but it was pretty salty for my tastes. My eggs came out EGGsactly right and were mouthwateringly delicious for something so simple--eggs. My fiance asked for tomatoes in his scrambled eggs, and those were extra too, and we weren't informed of that/how much until we saw it on the check (the pancake chocolate chips and the tomatoes somehow managed to be about $5, so I don't know how that stacks up, but it peeved me a bit).  If they ask you if you want toast or the banana muffin, DO NOT GET TOAST. GET THE DANG MUFFIN. It is sooooo good. It doesn't look like anything special, mostly because it's flat on top and served upside down, but it's soft and moist and tasty and warm and goodness gracious, so amazing. If you're counting calories, #1 you're in the wrong place, #2 put butter on it anyway.  The little eggy signs are so helpful for when you need to track down your server--a great idea instead of trying to get someone's attention in the (can be) noisy atmosphere.   This place is fantastic, but I pulled a star because the server forgot a side order for half the meal and didn't notify us of the upcharges on the items at time of order and after suggesting (i.e. we order regular pancakes, he suggests blueberry or chocolate chip, but doesn't mention they cost extra) after taking the menus so we couldn't see ourselves. I know some things are extra, but how much sometimes influences people's decisions--knowing if it was $0.50 versus $2.00 would have made that difference, for example. Overall, will DEFINITELY come again.",

    "text": "My family and I decided to try this place on the morning we were headed home from Vegas. We got it off of the Triple D website and have had great experiences in the past so it seemed like a great choice. While it was not a terrible experience, it was certainly a disappointing one and here is why:  My mother and I both have a food allergy to Monosodium Glutamate more commonly known as MSG. It is a flavor enhancer/ preservative often found in foods like Doritos, Cheetos, and all of those other junk foods you shouldn't be eating (but let's face it, sometimes we just need some junk food). For me, a little is OK, but my mother can't eat it at all.   When we sat down at the table, we asked if they used MSG more out of habit than anything else; why would a breakfast spot need a preservative? Our waitress, who was very nice, informed us that it was in most of the food, but not the eggs. My mother, who had originally decided on the highly rated Chicken Fried Steak, had to change her order. Both of chose the Sunrise Mountain and decided to order fruit rather than take our chances with the Habla Diablo potatoes that came with 90% of the breakfast options.  When the food came out it looked delicious, but one bite changed our opinion. While it was plentiful, it was bland. Even the blanket of cheese over the top could not help it.  My father, who does not share my MSG allergy, ordered a skillet. Mom and I both took a bite of the Habla Diablo potatoes from his plate and they were delicious. Crunchy and flavorful, I would have loved to be able to eat them, but they were covered in stomach pain inducing MSG. And the only option besides the potatoes was fruit (which was very nice, but did nothing for the dish itself).  I gave this place two stars because the service was good and the banana nut muffins delicious. Now if only they could learn how to cook with flavor rather than chemicals...",

If you do the Yelp check-in you get a free banana nut muffin. Let me just say this is like 2 muffins in one and it is seriously laced with crack because everyone at the table devoured it in silence. It was pretty damn good. I ordered the stuffed french toast and the other two got skillets (Santa Cruz and Cordon Bleu). Honestly, I was not prepared for what was set down in front of me. The sandwich was MASSIVE, I could barely get through half of it. The skillets were also massive in their size and no one at our table was able to finish their food despite how HANGRY we were when we got there. Everything was super good. Although the french toast sandwich was good, I liked the Cordon Bleu skillet was amazing! The prices were super cheap for the quality and quantity you get, it's totally worth coming here, especially considering how overpriced everything on the Strip is..",

Anyways we ordered our food and the service was pretty decent. Had to wait a bit for our food but that's just cause it was busy.

This time around, I finally made it and found out what I was missing.

The staff is always friendly and they place a newspaper style menu for you to look at. If you say it's your first time, most waitresses will bring you complimentary banana muffins for your table. But don't worry if they don't because most breakfast plates either come with toast or muffin..... Please go for the banana nut muffin!!! It's that good! For food I recommend the works skillet or any of their omelettes. They also have Hawaiian style food, which I haven't had the chance to try. The wait can go fast although it might take longer for larger groups. Parking can be a hassle during weekends. This restaurant will beat any overprice buffets on the strip, it's well worth it to go out of the strip for the food. And if you enjoy the muffin as much as I did, they sell banana nut loafs!",

She was so nice and attentive, with a cheerful disposition even tho she was so busy. And she brought my husband his free muffin even tho he was having trouble with his yelp app to check in. He did eventually but was very happy that she did that, cause that muffin, oh that muffin....I think it's the best banana nut muffin I've had in my life, and I've had my share! Lol...my husband had 3 of the blueberry pancakes w/a side of bacon. He enjoyed his meal but didn't even touch his bacon because the pancakes are a pretty decent size with fresh blueberries in the pancake and on the side was a blueberry jam sauce? It was sweet just as he likes it. I'm not a huge pancake fan so I don't make it much at home so he was happy. I ordered the chile rellenos omelette and I'm so glad I did!  I saw someone's picture of it and thought it looked good!  It was!  The sauce was tasty and everything just worked so well together with the pepper... Mmmmmm and my plate came with potatoes or toast and I chose the potatoes, I could leave that on the plate but my husband enjoyed it :)  and a muffin also came with the plate, BONUS!!

There were 5 of us and despite it being busy they seated us in less then 5 minutes. I had the mashed potato omelette which was delicious. Little pieces of bacon in the potatoes made the dish complete. Other people at my table were satisfied with their omelettes and loco moco.  They have a sad egg face you can display if you need service immediately, but we didn't have to use it since our waitress Genesis was on the ball.   For 5 people to eat, grab juices and coffee it was under $80, a True bargain compared to our other meals in Vegas.   Eat here and make your belly happy  :-)",

So on our way out of town to the Grand Canyon, we did a quick Yelp search and found this gem. Being in Vegas, we thought it was funny that there were 777 reviews for this place, averaging 4.5 stars. It lived up to the hype!   Definitely ask for the banana nut muffins, they are amazing. As are the potatoes. As are the omelettes...heck, it was ALL great! I ordered the chile relleno omelette (yes you read that right) and it was dee-lish.   Our server, Alyssa, was friendly and made sure everything was to our liking and topped off. The manager, Gia, stopped by our table to check in on us and ended up giving us some great ideas of places to check out on our road trip.  After the crazy hustle and bustle and Falseness of the Strip, it was great to eat at a down-home style diner. I liked it so much I wanted to buy a T-shirt, but they were out of the tie-dye one that I wanted. Which is probably the only non-five-star thing I can say about this place. We will definitely be back here again the next time we're in town!",

My daughter had the chicken fried steak skillet and loved it, she was stuffed and could not finish all of her order.  I ordered eggs benedict and my only complaint was that the center of the egg whites were still runny.  Kinda grossed me out.  I scraped the runny part out and ate the rest.  It was delicious and very filling.  We frequently eat at the Egg & I in various Colorado locations and are never disappointed in their quality or quanity.  The Sahara location is equally good.",

I went with a ham and cheese omelette and the person I was with had the pancakes.  We each had a banana nut muffin as well.  All was cooked to perfection and portions were huge.  My omelette came with home fries and all was delicious and perfect for the post Vegas night.  I tried the pancakes and they were great as well.  The banana nut muffin is a must try.

I enjoyed the chicken fried steak although there were too many potatoes for me. The flavor, cook, and gravy was spot on. The vegetable skillet had great flavor too but some of the vegetables were a little under done. But over all still a great breakfast place.

I have to agree with some of the other reviewers who suggest that when dining here with company it would be wise to split dishes as the portion sizes are very generous! I ordered the Hobo scramble which was a special and not available on the regular menu. I am sucker for a scramble however the superior quality of the muffin has convinced me to sample the sweeter items (waffles) on the menu the next time I visit this place. Lots of people rave about the potatoes and I have to say that they were not what I personally am looking for in a potato. They are covered in seasoning and I just prefer a simpler potato flavor. The coffee was great and I cannot say that about many places! Here it is a good strength with a good flavor and it comes in cute mug with two happy eggs on it! Probably my favorite thing about this place is the little egg sign at your table that you can flip from happy to sad when you are in need of something. It beats having to pay close attention to flag down your waiter whenever they walk by. On our visit we didn't even have to use it because the service was so good!",

    "text": "My wife and I visit Vegas at least once a year.  Until I found this place (and others) on Yelp, we used to just have breakfast/brunch in the hotel's anonymous coffee shop.  Meh.   Now that Yelp has opened my eyes, we've tried different places.  The Egg & I is one of our favorites for breakfast (actually brunch since we don't leave the hotel until 10 a.m. or so).  We eat here most often because there is a plethora of different items on their menu to choose from and they are ALL GOOD!  Breakfast is my favorite meal to eat when I'm away from home, so this is important to me.  To be honest it is pretty difficult to screw up a basic breakfast centered on eggs and breakfast meat.  However, the Egg & I is head and shoulders above the others with various delicious potato and egg treatments, their muffins, and friendly service staff.  Needless to say, we don't eat in hotel coffee shops anymore.  Not only do you get huge quantities of food at the Egg & I, it all tastes great, and what a variety!  If you're not into eggs, they also have waffles, pancakes and french toast, as well as salads and sandwiches.  Also free wifi so you can catch up on news from home & messages while eating.  If you are like my wife and insist on staying in a big-name Strip resort hotel, do yourself a favor and drive a short distance off the strip to have breakfast and some really tasty food.  Catch a glimpse of what the rest of the City of Las Vegas looks like, and taste real food, not the bland stuff the corporate chains dish out.  You might realize, like I did, that The Strip is not the final destination of your trip to Vegas.  There are fine dinner restaurants off the Strip as well!  Yelp is here for you.",

Even my veggie friends have loved this place. Service is really friendly and attentive. First time I went there I had 3 different servers coming to take my order. I am not complaining. Idea of changing the egg logo to show that you need something is really cool. They might have taken it too far with \"EggCeptional\" kinda stuff on their T-shirts.  They have LCD TVs so you can watch football games while having breakfast (if you are sober enough). One star less for not having this in San Diego.",

Maybe they were just having a bad day? I got the basic pancakes with bacon breakfast. How can you go wrong right?? Well let me tell you, the bacon was hard and chewy and the pancakes were like chewing on their old recycled newspaper menus. It was like eating 100 crackers that you were unable to swallow. My BF got the eggs benedict that came with potatoes. The potatoes were like hollow skins with no meat inside and were salted beyond belief. I think we left swollen from all the water retention.. At least we can say that we tried it but we will definately be sticking to The Omlette House or Hash House A Go Go for breakfast when we visit Vegas.",

You get to choose from a good omelet selection, to huevos rancheros.  If you aren't in the mood for eggs they also have the usual sandwiches and burgers.  Get a side of the banana nut muffin its really good.  Vegetarian Rating: 4/5 lots of good veggie options, they even had a vegetarian version of Eggs Benedict.",

I ordered the veggie good omelette.  The yummy omelette (I requested mushroom, spinach, and cheddar on mine) came with well-seasoned potatoes and their infamous banana nut muffin.  You must try their banana nut muffin!  It was probably the best banana nut muffin I've ever had and I'm not exaggerating.  It tasted like there was a slight hint of buttermilk in the muffins but whatever this restaurant did to them made them amazzzingggg.    All the portions sizes are huge and I liked how I could easily substitute items that were orginally in the veggie good omelette to make my order just the way I like it.  Great prices for what you are getting as well.  The atmosphere is also fun and filled with egg puns!  Egg-static!",

We waited for around 40 minutes to get our table and were surprised they did not have heaters.  If they know winters are on the cold side in Las Vegas, not sure why they don't invest some money  get a few of them.  I ordered the Crazy chicken omelette ($11) and it added up to my non enjoyable experience. It was flavorless, and the chicken and mushrooms were inexistent.  Overload of flavorless cheese on top of my omelette.  The habla Diablo fries were pretty good.  The banana muffin was the best part of my . It was warm when it came out and got a second one as I checked in in yelp!   My boyfriend got the Corned beef hash and it was good but again not the best breakfast/brunch I had in my life!  I might come back just to try something else and figure out if it was my meal that wasn't good. However, I don't feel like recommending it to anyone.   Cheers!",

The waitress attended everyone quite frequently which is good especially when it's busy. If your also looking for food option don't worry they have quite a selection of entrees. The only down side is that I ordered the steak and eggs and to be honest it was over salty. Also, the potatoes I was pretty disappointed because I was expecting hasbrowns or even fresh shredded or something fresh. These tasted and looked like fries I could buy frozen at the store. And there salsa was weak.  But to be fair it's an establishment that has great food options......maybe I just didn't have a good day.",

We had a party of 3 and waited about 10-15 minutes before we got seated. My friend ordered the stuffed french toast, which was HUGE! The bf ordered the eggs benedict, which was not bad and good portions. I ended up ordering the egg-crepe, which was simiar to an omelette. Pretty good and not too heavy.   What we loved the most was their banana nut muffin and ranch potatoes. O man, my mouth is watering just thinking about how light and tasty their banana nut muffin was. I could eat like 5 of those in 1 sitting. hahaha. =X We were all raving about how  the ranch potatoes were so flavorful. Plus, each dish had a big portion of it. I definitely wasn't complaining.   Our waitress was very attentive, but not over-bearing. She told us if we needed something, we could just flip the little egg over to get her attention (reminded me of Bubba Gump's).  I will definitely want to come back and try other things on the menu, since I go to Vegas about 3 times a year.",

If you like a little Mexican with your brunch this is a dish worth trying. My partner had the homemade corned beef hash.  Also delicious, big chunks of meat. The meal started with their muffins. So Good, I wish we saved one for later.",

We were going to share a chile relleno omelet, and asked for an extra muffin, when the waitress told us that we could order half orders of just about anything on the menu - the cost was half of the menu price + 50 cents.  We did that instead, order half an omelette and half an order of grilled banana bread french toast. So I said - well, we won't need the other muffin, but the waitress said - no charge! - I'll bring you an extra anyway.  The food was excellent. The breakfast potatoes need some work - they were just hard fried \"bits\" of potatoes - but everything else was great.  A carafe of coffee was left on our table so that we didn't have to keep asking for refills, and cream/flavored creamers are on the table to make a perfect cup of coffee.  It was delightful - a trip back in time!  Don't miss it if you have a car in LV!",

If you have read my other post you know I love chicken fried steak and of course that was my order here.  The steak was seasoned very good and had a lot of flavor.... really good!  I will be back to get it again in the future.  The gravy was good but not great in my opinion.  I really liked their breakfast potatoes as well as they were season with extra season and were better than I expected.  The eggs are eggs and nothing special there.  Also their banana muffin is really good.  It is a bit greasy and not for anyone on a diet but you talking to someone that eats fried meats for breakfast.",

Arrived early afternoon, there was pretty much no wait, even though there were some customers lingering near the entrance inside and the place was still full! Service was extremely down-to-earth, friendly, and attentive!  This place has a huge menu (in the form of a \"newspaper\"...if that gives you some idea). There were so many choices it was really hard to decide on just one =( The variety is vast, but the bulk of the items were simple, straightforward, typical breakfast dishes with unique modifications/twists or add-ons. My husband's chile relleno omelet was such a great idea for an omelet...the juicy chile and the cheese tasted amazing wrapped in egg! My benedict's garden (vegetarian version of egg's benedict) was superb as well. Even though one of the items listed in my dish was guacamole, I was SO pleasantly surprised when it arrived NOT as guacamole, but pretty much a whole avocado sliced up!!! You don't get that often, even in California! +10 points for that! The whole combination of poached eggs, hollandaise sauce, and avocado was such a delicious creamy mix, and perfectly-balanced by the crisp freshness of the tomatoes. I basically devoured it in under 5 minutes...and then had to wait for the husband to finish his plate *rolls eyes.* We both agreed that their seasoned potatoes were freaking AMAZING. We don't know what kind of seasoning they use, but it reminded us of Cajun and it was to die for. I wish they sold it by the bottle!   Wonderful place, with reasonable prices (total with tax came out to be $27) and a great cup of coffee as well. The awesome staff makes it even better!",

    "text": "Love Egg and I. We needed a pick-me-up after a bad doctors office visit. Took 2 hours for 2 mins of doc attention so we were pretty annoyed. This lifted our spirits, because we both love breakfast foods. We drove a few miles to go to Egg and I simply because I wanted to try it based on the great Yelp reviews. We were not disappointed. Everything was great for my first time ever eating here. We walked in at 1215 and were immediately seated on a Thursday lunch hour. There were plenty of tables inside and out, and since it was a sunny calm day we decided it'd be nice to get out and get a little sun after being stuck in the doc office. I went with the \"This Little Piggy\" omelet and it was just the way I like it. Lots of egg, lots of cheese, and plenty of meats. It comes with chopped up bacon, chopped up sausage, and chopped up chunks of ham, folded in half and smothered with about a half pound of cheese!!!! Also comes with the country potatoes which I was expecting to be orgasmic based on reviews, but let me down just a little bit. Don't get me wrong they were really good, but maybe my batch just wasn't quite cooked long enough and they were a little softer than I like em. Also I got the banana nut muffin with my meal, (this thing WAS OUT-friggen-STANDING) and she brought it out before the meal, which I thought to be a little strange. But i was really hungry so it was just fine with me. My honey got a breakfast burrito and she said it was really good, looked to me like it had a ton of peppers, which isn't my favorite thing in the world, but she enjoyed it. Had to take half of it home because she couldn't finish it all, this thing was pretty big and also came with the country potatoes. This was a great breakfast experience and can understand how this place can get pretty busy at times. We were very happy with the food and mostly happy with the service, she was just a little slow a couple times and we were only there for about 45 minutes. i.e. forgot to get a sprite, and never really came back to ask us if we needed anything after our food was brought out and if it was cooked ok. After she brought the check we decided to get a refill to go since the sprite was $2.50 and brought late and we waited for a few minutes to see her but never did. In the end it worked out, when we paid we asked the cashier if she could help us in getting the to-go refill and she politely went and took care of that for us with a smile. :) Thanks Egg and I, we will be back for sure!",

If you're looking for a nice break from The Strip, this is a good choice.  The food is decent. Not gourmet, but certainly not bad neither. There is a wide array to choose from. I particularly am fond of the omelets, which are quite tasty. The skillets are quite good also.  Oh yeah... don't pass up the Banana Nut Muffins... it's eggscellent.",

My BF had read a few great reviews about the Egg and I recently and suggested we try it after sitting in out DR. office appt. for 2 hours; needless to say it made us hungry.  The day was warm and not too windy so we opted to sit outside on the patio.  Nothing impressive but it did just fine.  The newspaper style menu was fun and different.  Right away I saw about 6 items I would like to try.  As did my hungry man.  I finally decided on the breakfast burrito.  And he picked This little piggy omelet.  Our food came very quickly and looked great!! The burrito was huge and looked great.  There was 4 scrambled eggs, cheese, peppers, onions and huge side of   their breakfast potatoes.  There was also a side of salsa that was tasty and not too spicy.  My BF food looked yummy as well, I knew this when he ate it all with few words.   The only thing that could have been better was a more attentive server.  We had to look around for a water and soda refill.  I hate that.  She was however very sweet and seemed a little new.  I will defiantly be going back to try some of the other dishes that made my mouth water.  Overall, the Egg and I is a sure fire great breakfast experience.",

I'm guessing that batter frying slices of Banana Bread is only legal in Vegas.   Lots of other goodies on the menu. My wife got a savory crepe that was delicious with a side of their seasoned potatoes that you don't want to stop eating.   Escape from the strip and go here for breakfast if you are in town. It was so good, I went twice during our stay.   Service was good. Everyone is attentive and mostly smiling (which is rare to find). They give you your own pot of coffee which is a huge plus in my book.",

It was light and fluffy and the banana flavor was subtle.   The corned beef hash comes with ranch potatoes (think Tommys style fries with that red seasoning only diced up), eggs, and a side of watermelon and pineapple. The hash was served under scrambled eggs in a skillet. The ranch potatoes were crisp and flavorful. I just wish the hash was a bit crispier. Since the hash was made with a mixture of potatoes, the texture remained soft and did not create any contrast with the scrambled eggs. It had good flavor though.   Lastly, the customer service is top notch. All the waitresses were happy to help and near the end of brunch, the owner/manager came over just to chit chat, which I appreciated.",

The portions are ridiculous and will def. get you full. I got whatever they recommended which was the Mexican omelette and my boyfriend got the chicken n gravy skillet. The chicken n gravy skillet was a little salty for me but my boyfriend enjoyed it. The coffee is $3 but they give you a big pitcher of coffee to enjoy. When you're done, you pay in the front.",

    "text": "Overrated? Probably. This place was honestly lukewarm in taste and service.  Considering the overbearing amount of 5 star reviews this place has, I'm not sure why my experience was so disappointing in comparison.   We ordered the banana nut muffin (free with a check in), the Classic, and the Works skillet. Two tables that were seated after us received their food before we did. We ended up waiting a really long time just for two entrees. But we brushed it off considering there could be many factors at play.  The Classic had three slices of bacon that resembled rubber. They were not crispy at all. I didn't like the seasoning of Hablo Diablo potatoes as I felt the seasoning was overbearingly strong. I felt like there was hardly any meat and a WHOLE lot of potatoes.   We drank all our water and tried to get our waitress's attention. After five minutes or so, I flipped the egg to yellow (meaning we would like attention). Our waitress glanced at our table and proceeded to walk away. Another waitress promptly flipped it back to black and asked what we needed. When I said we needed a refill she said okay and proceeded to chat with the table next to us. She never bothered to grab our waters. Finally, our waitress asked what it was that we needed earlier and finally got us water.   Also guess what? Never got the banana nut muffin.  Sorry, but there are way too many delicious breakfast eats like Babystacks Cafe or Black Bear Diner (with their huge portions) for me to ever come back.",

This place has just about anything you could think of for hot breakfast, (except oatmeal) and some items you would never dream of.  The newspaper-style menu is a breakfast gazette of headlines - like carrot cake French toast, pork carnitas burritos, and just about every type of omelet and pancake you could ever imagine.  Liza was our fabulous hostess on our dining journey. This woman is the epitome of a multi-tasker, buzzing around and paying attention to every little detail, from the quality of our food to the assurance our glasses remained full... and even the fact that I was rubbing my arms and she instantly picked up that I was cold and turned the air conditioner up a few degrees, without me asking.  This woman is amazing at customer service!   All of our food came out together (for seven people) and it was all piping hot! We were never left unattended and were quite entertained at how Liza perfectly orchestrated her tables (including our own).  Some of the dishes at our table included: * Stuffed French toast - like a deconstructed monte cristo with bacon; delicious! * Vegetarian crepe - filled with veggie goodness.; so fresh and so clean-clean. * The Classic - hot scrambled eggs, toast and ham - American style. * Pork carnitas burrito - mexitastic pork in a verde sauce wrapped in a soft flour tortilla; to die for. * Egg whites and short stack of buckwheat pancakes - both cooked with no oil...  I was trying to watch my caloric intake, and The Egg and I was happy to accommodate me.  It's a bit of a drive from the strip, but so worth it! Bring your clan and ask for Liza!",

    "text": "I love places like this that specialize in breakfast, so I was especially happy that the lady found out about and suggested (The) Egg & I on our second morning in Vegas.  Got there about 9:00 a.m. on a Tuesday, and although the place was busy, it wasn't packed, so there was no wait for a table.  Started with coffee which was surprisingly good - very mellow with a good flavor.  I even thought about asking what kind of coffee they use, but unfortunately forgot.  I ordered my favorite - corned beef hash and eggs, while the lady ordered country fried steak.  CBH was in a soft patty form.  The corned beef was of the finely-shredded variety probably from a can, so don't expect chunks from a brisket they brined and carved themselves.  I'm not complaining - the stuff was tasty.  The two eggs on top were done a nice over easy.  I wasn't a fan of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes, which tasted okay, but were a little too loose for me - like if you tried to scoop them with your fork instead of stabbing them, they would just fall off.  I like hash browns, home fries, etc. that stick together a bit so you can put them on the same bite as the CBH/egg/omelette/etc.  I can't believe it's just me.  Right?  The lady's country fried steak was tender and tasty.  Not out of this world, but certainly better than you'd get at an IHOP.  While I had wheat toast, she chose the banana muffin, which was great - just filling, so with the good portions of the rest of out breakfasts, we couldn't finish it.  Service was friendly, and the prices were reasonable.  I'd definitely come back.",

I was gonna order the stuffed French toast AND their Ultimate Skillets but the friendly waitress said she could do half portion of each since she said their portions are pretty big, so I agreed and ordered half n half.   The food came and they look amazing!! The skillet was delicious, their potatoes were very flavorful, the stuffed French toast with eggs and syrup was yummy. Maybe I was just hungry, I felt like I could handle the full portion of BOTH next time. My waitress was really friendly, always have the smile on her face.

It's really hard to find a place with great food, great service and great prices. We were on vacation in Las Vegas and ate here 2 days in a row. I have never eaten at the same restaurant two days in a row. I only wish this restaurant we're closer to my house as I would be eating here every week.  I am on a low-carb low-sugar diet. But I broke my diet to have their maple bacon French toast, twice!! It is so delicious it is better than a desert. We also ordered the chicken fried steak and chorizo scramble. Everything was delicious. We ordered their potatoes one morning and their fresh fruit the other. Their fresh fruit is wonderfully cut up slices of watermelon and pineapple and other melons. Not the yucky, cheap, cut up fruit that's been sitting there for days. Their breakfast potatoes are all so delicious. The best way we can describe them is they are  very seasoned bite-size french fries. sooooo goood! I guess it's a blessing in disguise The Egg & I is located in Las Vegas and we live in San Diego. I would definitely be gaining weight if this place were closer. Can't wait to go back to eat here. It's a couple miles from the strip that you will definitely enjoy your meal and save money.",

Come early or plan to wait for a table.  The banana muffin that comes with a lot of the meals was amazing!  If it doesn't come with it you should order one. It's warm and moist and perfect.  I got the Santa Cruz bfast burrito. So delicious. The sauce on to was perfect. My wife got the veggie works eggs Benedict. It too was good. There are just so many good options on the menu that it's hard to choose. I would definitely get the burrito again.",

You can get half portions which was perfect size for 1 person.  Banana pancake was okay, I'd rather have the banana slices on top instead of smashed into the batter.  You get a Banana nut Muffin with the free check in, but I wasn't a fan of it.  Customer service was a bit slow and forgetful, we had to remind her of a few things more than once.",

We had 3 different people helping us throughout our meal and they were all very quick, happy, and extremely nice.   I ordered the Works Veggie Benny which is easily the best eggs benedict that I've had! The portions were huge too! The potatoes are amazing and they even sell the seasonings inside the restaurant, so stock up!   The place is pet friendly on the patio and they have a list of rules to follow so that you, your pet, and the other customers can have an enjoyable meal.   Also, take advantage of the check-in offer! Since we were so full, we took our muffins to-go, but don't doubt that they'll stay in their boxes for long!",

We were seated right away since our party of 5 decided we would sit outside to avoid the wait (TIP!!!!) It was nice for a while until it started getting humid and nasty but we stuck it through.  We had the Eggceptional Omelette (3 stars), Bacon Avocado & Egg (4 stars) - these flavors ALWAYS mesh well together!, The chicken fried steak skillet (5 stars) and the cinnamon raisin french toast (2 stars).  A tip: stay away from the cinnamon raisin french toast. Couldn't taste the cinnamon in it at all and it was kind of soggy. Not the heavenly experience in your mouth you get when you think of french toast ... mmmm. BUT get the chicken fried steak skillet!!! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT. Scrambled eggs on top. So yummy.  And of course, the banana nut muffin is still my favorite of all time here!",

Our server, Liza, was top notch and gave us great recommendations and service. We ordered The Classic and Texas French Toast works. The Classic blew me away. The Classic is just potatoes, eggs and your choice of meat. I got the links with it and they were amazing. So simple but bursting with flavor! The free banana nut muffin at check in is probably the most moist, gooey and orgasmic muffin I ever had. Please don't forget to order that to try. Overall, a wonderful and unbeatable brunch experience away from the strip.",

Unfortunately I will not be coming back here anymore. I was dining at the restaurant with a friend a month ago. When two white women came into the restaurant and were seated in the table next to us.  They were having a very loud and expletive filled conversation which included the use of the N word several times. People at other tables could hear them too and were just as disgusted as I was. My asked the waitress could she speak to the manager about these 2 women. I thought she would ask the two women to leave considering they had not even placed their orders yet and where disturbing the other patrons. He just looked at me smiled and said do you need anything else. No thank you there are plenty of other breakfast places in Vegas.",

The service is really good, the  food itself is okay, I think is very typical of brunch food, nothing really stood out to me. In addition, I don't like too much egg for breakfast.  The egg benedict that everyone raves about is just okay for because I don't like that they put the crossiant under the bed of egg and cubed rib eye because it made it extremely soggy. Remember to check in for your FREE banana nut muffin",

We came here for brunch after getting our asses drunk AF the previous morning. #HangoverFTW. It was 100+ degrees come 10:30am and we were waiting outside to be seated, luckily we didn't wait that long and managed to snag a seat at their patio (thank goodness their misters were on). The staff was amazing in accommodating our large party outside and they rocked taking all our orders and getting them out in a timely manner.  I ordered their fresh vegetable (vegetarian) omelette with egg whites sans cheese with a side of potatoes. The omelette was pretty good, although nothing terribly mind-blowing and it came with spinach and mushrooms. The house potatoes were not my favorite, but still eatable. It had way too much seasoning making it very salty.  The food was decent overall, would like to come and try their scrambles the next time I'm in Vegas. :) Can't go wrong with affordable mom and pop restaurants off the Strip.",

The menu was quite extensive with many options. Also must add that it is located a few miles off the Strip in a safe location in a small shopping center. The restaurant itself is nothing fancy, but if you're looking for delicious food served quickly at a reasonable price, look no further.",

Very helpful and attentive, especially considering she was carrying a baby around too!  Back to the food, best traditional brunch place I have been in the States. We tried the banana muffin, spinach/avocado/veg omelet, gravy biscuits, pork, and sausage. Excuse me that I don't remember the exact name for the plates.

I flipped through and saw this place called Egg & I and their other location Egg Works. It looked interesting and the reviews sounded good plus had coupon for one meal free with purchase of another meal. Cool..I will take my co-workers there. Big mistake! They know best known for banana nut muffin served warm with butter but it had this weird taste as if they used artificial sweetener or perhaps the blend wasn't right because it tasted like metal or whatever it just tasted awful. It was nice to give all 6 of us free banana nut muffin but my guys wouldn't touch it!   I ordered classic eggs Benedict, my fav breakfast choice. I was excited plus the potatoes versus hash browns. The potatoes had too much of that lawry seasoning...ugh. Then worse, my hollandaise sauce was the worst thing I have ever had! They didn't properly make the sauce and then to make it worse, the whole dish was slathered in it! I literally used a spoon to scoop out the sauce just so I could eat everything else which wasn't much better but I needed to eat. Would never come back even if I was paid to do so plus I read other reviews where this place was actually busy and needed to go early, well we were there Saturday morning around 8am and it was not busy at all!",

She claim she didn't have my contact info I had left with the employee I spoke with. Since then that employee has been delt with. I'm happy that she reached out to me. I passed on the info to my cousin and she apologized for the whole incident......I'm grateful to say she sent my cousin her purse holder. She said she could tell it was valuable and put it in a safe. She was a woman of her word and I thank her. I glad of the turn out, because the food was good and I would love to dine there again.  Now I will dine there and spread the word. Next time I'm there I would like to meet her and thank her personally. There are some good people in the world.",

It was easy to find and the staff was very welcoming and friendly.  Very professional and efficient. The restaurant was very clean and well cared for.  The food choices were all very tempting and our server, Karla, was very helpful, even recommending an egg breakfast for my husband that included everything he wanted for a better price than what he was going to order.  I had the Southwestern Cobb salad and it was delicious....very fresh and the chicken was hot off the grill! The banana muffin that came with my salad was yummy.  Lots of variety on the menu....but since I am not an egg lover I was glad there were plenty of choices that didn't focus on eggs.  We would highly recommend this place and will definitely come again on our next visit to Vegas.  Karla is the kind of server you love to have...she's friendly, efficient, knows the menu, is really helpful and gives you the perfect amount of attention while dining. Great start to our day all around!",

Of course in Vegas you'd think there'd be something special about the eggs... like a dinosaur-size egg over easy... but in the end the eggs are pretty standard eggs... nuttin' too special.  If you mess up eggs, you've got no business serving food.  My 5 stars are for the hash!  Something about that homemade beef hash makes it stand out over all others.",

My two scrambled eggs, which HAD to actually be four because they covered half the huge place, were browned and chewy. I ate the steak after scraping off the gravy.

    "text": "this place is great. i would give it five stars if they had a tofu scramble or some veggie options but i know vegas isn't big on their vegan.  the portions are enormous. no one in my group finished their food, and we all love to eat. the ranch potatoes are good but a touch salty after a while. the egg salad was very good, the seasonal pancakes were amazing... i had a chicken sandwich with onions and peppers and it was delicious.  the place itself is adorable; there are some really great pig-themed drawings in the lobby that i wish i had in my house! my favorite was \"swine on harvest moon\" closely seconded by \"tammy faye bacon.\"   the service was great- they have a happy egg/sad egg table alert system so you can put up your egg to signal you need something. brilliant! and the menus were little newspapers, which is really fun.  totally going to remember this place and come back!!",

I have been many times, tried many things (egg sandwiches, corn beef hash, pancakes, etc) and it is all good!!!!  I also love the banana nut muffin that comes with many of the dishes. It's huge and sooo goood. Feels like an extra dessert. You can save it for later.   Give this place a try.   Any of the locations will be good! I like this location because they have a big parking lot. Oh and I love the decorations/characters of the entire franchise. So cute!",

We had been in with coffee waiting for him to take our order which he eventually did but after two tables were seated in his area both black maybe 10 mins after us and both received their meals before us which was at least 10 mins before us. When he brought my wife's mine wasn't there it was another 7 mins to mine came then we had to ask for the toast and 5 mins later he brought us the wrong kind.  Food was so so nothing great but the service was terrible and I guess we were victims of racial discrimination!  The first table was 5 people and the second was two and they both had their meals at least 10 mins before us!",

It was super crowded, we waited 30 mins to be seated and that's 30 minutes of my life I will never get back. Finally after waiting in the super tiny, crowded waiting area (it was either that or freeze to death outside) we were finally seated. I ordered a \"fresh squeezed orange juice\" my boyfriend ordered an iced latte and we both took one sip and sent them back. They were so bitter. After a ridiculously long wait the food finally came and it was terrible. I picked at my pancakes because I was starving but the eggs were hard and tasteless. The potatoes were like the ones from the frozen section. They were not fresh. I definitely don't ever plan on ever visiting again or recommending this place to anyone. I could have had better quality food from a drive through fast food joint.",

The dish consisted of eggs over medium over a layer of sliced chicken fried steak on top of a layer of potatoes all smothered with a coat of gravy.   I love greasy and unhealthy foods in general but I am starting to think that my taste buds are slowly changing.  The meat was dry and salty.  I had to continually dip the chicken in the gravy to get some moisture and to mask the salt away.  The potatoes were even worse.  They were doused with a heavy coat of seasoning salt.   I considered wiping each piece of potato with my napkin so that they would be edible.  I drank a lot of water that day.  I do want to mention, however, that service was nice and my wife enjoyed her huevos rancheros.  Ohhhhh... Banana nut muffin was quite good.  It was moist but not very fluffy.    My new old man self suspects that something not too healthy was used to get it that moist.  Sometimes not knowing for sure about something like this is better.",

I had the chicken, mushroom & broccoli skillet but also tried the country fried steak.  The banana nut muffin that comes with most dishes is also quite very moist and tasty.  No alcohol so one ding for that, but otherwise, a very good place to get your grub on.",

I don't like nuts so did not have the banana nut muffin (wife loved it) and waitress said blueberry one is not homemade so beware - she was right. There are half portions to the large portions, and my wife had the half omelet.  Veggie skillet was great as well. If you need wait staff help, you flip a little egg stand on your table.",

Everyone who works there was terribly nice, and we loved the little egg sign that tells the staff if you need something. You must order the stuffed French toast!!  I'm not normally a French toast eater, but this is not normal French toast!  SO yummy, like the best sweet and hearty sandwich I've ever had - I could only get through half of it.  My friend had the eggs plus, which looked yummy, and a banana nut muffin that everyone raves about - it was awesome.  Their ranch potatoes are also amazing, like eating tiny square-shaped french fries. Everything is so well-priced.  We paid $26 including tip for both of us, and considering I had an orange juice, I'd say that's pretty great.",

The boyfriend's scramble which was supposed to be topped with a couple eggs looks like it had 4-5 eggs.  He was pretty happy with that.  My chicken fried steak was good, but I couldn't touch the potatoes which were covered in way too much of their salty seasoning...they looked like someone dumped a bottle of Lawry's on them as a joke.  Speaking of jokes, the lady at the register thought it was HILARIOUS when my boyfriend said the food was \"eggs-quisite\".  DUMB!!",

I wanted to run away when we pulled into the shopping center, located past that road where the palms hotel is. Its like a used car dealership wasteland on this street. That is how I found this place, while doing some car shopping all morning and finally getting so desperate for food we ventured down the road. Not somewhere you think you find a great breakfast place. Or so I thought.  You walk into what feels like a family style diner greeted by a cute older woman who reminded me of my own grandma. Always a plus.  Get seated and scope out the menu,  lots of great options for omelets. We loved Canadian bacon or what my boyfriend likes to call bacon from Canada, ordered that. Preferred the waffles over the pancakes. (Learned that from my first trip there.) Order two orders of skillet potatoes (one for me and one for Adam.) They are literally that good. Each bite is a perfectly seasoned little bite of french fry / hash brown combination. Fruit platter with your choice of three berries. Lots of orange juice because I'm a sucker for pulp and vitamin c to start out my day.   After 5 times here I've realized, it's really great for what it is. A alternative for some Denny's or Ihop because I'd rather support a local business owner. This place has breakfast down and I plan on eating here whenever I'm craving those skillet potatoes.

My husband told me that he used to eat here with his grandparents when they lived in Vegas. It's located in an older plaza and from the outside did not look busy.  We arrived around 9:00AM and it was pretty packed inside, but we were seated at a table right away.  I ordered the Sundance Special (veggie omelette with spinach, mushrooms, artichoke hearts folded with Swiss cheese and a special Works artichoke cheese filling, topped with Feta cheese and fresh tomatoes). I also got potatoes and a banana nut muffin.   Our server was really nice. The food was so good! Honestly, the best veggie omelet I've ever tried. The banana nut muffin was also a delicious treat and so moist.  My husband did good bringing me here to make up for the awful food we had the day before LOL. Thumbs up.  :)  I'd definitely come here again when we are in the area.  105/100 Reviews for 2016",

Only Tip is tell the waitress you want your muffins after the meal cause if not they bring them out first. All in all not a bad restaurant and we would come here again maybe earlier though. A party of 6 and well accommodating tables. Large portions and so much good you could share a plate! All pancakes sold separate from meals, most meals come with either toast or their signature banana nut muffin! Banana nut muffin is oh soo good especially hot!",

He gave us directions and this place did not disappoint.  Its about a 10 minute drive from the strip but well worth it.  The portions are large, the service is outstanding and the food is great!    Prior to arriving, I yelped it and saw all the great reviews.  We ordered the Banana nut muffin which was really good.  It was served warm with whipped butter.  Excellent start.  We ordered the ultimate skillet and a chile relleno omelet with a side of biscuit and gravy.  When the food came out I was amazed by the sheer size of the skillet.  It was was mound of food all served fresh and hot.  My chili relleno omelet was SOOO DELICIOUS.  It was topped off with melted cheese and a enchilada sauce with minced cilantro.  The omelet was one the best I've ever had.  The ranch potato's were crispy and seasoned well.  My biscuit and gravy was good but I was not really wowed by it.    Our service was great.  The kept our beverage cups full and checked on us without being annoying.  The decor is a little cheesy but it works.  There are TVs on every wall so you can watch the news or ESPN.    Definitely will be back the next time in Vegas.  Its a nice break from all hustle and bustle of the strip.",

In the four or five times that I've frequented this establishment, I've noticed several things:  1.  Many of the female servers are quite attractive and helpful.  2.  The male servers that I've had have all been invariably incompetent, rude and sometimes a combination of both.  3.  For the price, (Bouchon's $18 version is slightly better) the corned beef hash is the best I've had in any restaurant.  The first time I came here, I tried it, and I don't think I've ever ordered anything else.  Beyond that, the owner/manager lady provides a stalwart presence at the cash register with that unique mix of friendly/surly grandmotherliness that only American women in their 60's can truly evince.",

Everyone was more than pleased with their order; I had the philly cheese steak, great meat to veggies ratio, very tasty, and their fries are killer.

Looked up on Yelp and found this little gem.  It's around a 10minute drive from the Strip, without traffic of course.  I ordered the Crazy Chicken omelet with the muffin. They leave the whole carafe of coffee on your table, saving yourself from waving down a waiter(ess) every time you want a refill.  The omelet itself was very tasty, the muffin, while not as heavenly as some others claim, was indeed very moist and tasty and worth a try. The potato that came was what made my day. The fried squared shaped potato was crispy on the outside, but still mushy on the inside! Such a delight!  If I find myself in Vegas some other day, I'll definitely come back again!  Try to be here before 9am on the weekend, the waiting list was long by the time we arrived at 10am on the Saturday we visited.",

It's a Sunday morning so we came into it assuming we would be waiting at least 30+ minutes. Although it was packed we probably only waited between 15-20 minutes. For breakfast on a Sunday morning that's really not bad.  We got seated on the patio which is what we wanted at the time but honestly we froze to death. If you're eating breakfast before 11AM sit inside or wear like ten sweaters.  We both ordered omelettes. I had the mashed potato Omelette and my friend had the bacon and avocado omelette.  Huge, huge portions! And very tasty! I had half of my omelette left over to take home!  It's a pricier place to eat breakfast you're probably looking at between 11-15 dollars for breakfast and OJ but it is very much worth it!",

    "text": "Arrived worrying about too much salt and MSG (via previous Yelp reviews). But right away I knew I'd be disappointed when I learned that they didn't have real maple syrup for their pancakes. Its regular customer must be some one who likes the artificial sugar syrup they serve at cheap restaurants. It wasn't even an option for an additional charge.  To be fair, my kids didn't care their Mickey Mouse pancakes came with sugar syrup. And the prices for everything were reasonable. While I didn't find their eggs Benedict too salty (I am not salt sensitive), the MSG in the Hollindaise was palpable and the famous Diablo potatoes were \"meh\" (and I like spicy!). On the plus side, their banana nut muffins were delicious, as advertised.",

Servers are always busy and it can be hard to get their attention with a never-ending inflow of people so what you can do is turn your eye to your table stand. Flip from a black to a yellow egg as an indicator that you're ready and a server would be at your table in no time. I found it unique and utterly adorable.   After taking a while to eye the vast newspaper style menu, I got a huge portion of tender country fried chicken served with over easy eggs, home fries and their iconic banana nut muffin while mommy got the chicken, broccolli and mushroom skillet. It was the best thing that happened that morning.   A point to take note of; the skillet is blanketed with a layer of cheddar cheese (wink to the lactose intolerant). To my fellow mint-lovers, do not miss the caramel peppermint candies available at the cashier. Slip a couple more of em' in your pockets if you can.",

Browsed through yelp and found this cute joint. The good portions are HUGE and yummy. I also liked that they have the happy egg or sad egg card that you put on a stand to let wait staff know you need something instead of them constantly checking on you. I say if you're in the area or in Vegas with a car this would be a great breakfast stop. Also, if you check in you get free banana bread -- mhmmm.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for a day and needed a place to take the family of 7 to breakfast.  Checked Yelp and this place was rated #2 for the area.  So we drove over.  When we arrived, the restaurant was full and there were about 20 people waiting outside.  To me, that was a good sign.  We put in our name and waited only about 15 minutes to get seated.    We were immediately greeted by our server Kat and while we were looking at the huge breakfast menu, she was busy slinging our coffee and juices.  It is really hard to make a selection off of their menu.  Everything sounded really good.  Even Kat (the server) couldn't narrow it down to the \"best item.\"  She said the best she could do was a \"top 10.\"    We all ordered something different.  I had the Blackened Prime Rib Eggs Benedict.  It was really amazing.  The Hollandaise sauce tasted exactly how it was supposed to taste.  The Prime Rib could have been a little more blackened for my taste buds, but it was still very good.  Other members of my group had the Hawaiian breakfast with Portuguese Sausage, eggs and sticky rice.  Also ordered was the Chicken Fried Steak Skillet, the Blueberry Waffles, Blueberry Pancakes and your basic egg, meat and potato dish.  Everything was good.  Everyone at the table was raving at how good the food was and how they were all happy with their choices.  The banana nut muffins were an extra special treat.    One more thing.  The service was amazing.  Kat was great...and the manager even came out and checked on us.  Great service!  And, to top it all...all seven of us and were out the door in under an hour even though it was a packed house.    So if you are visiting Vegas and looking for a place to go, forget those expensive buffets and places on the strip and head over to this place.  I guarantee you that you won't be disappointed!",

The menu is a cute, reminiscent of a newspaper so it give you an old-timey diner feel of reading a paper in the morning. The little black and yellow egg sign was cute too, just flipping it let the server know that you needed their attention, so many eggs everywhere it was a bit on the cheesy  side. The extensive menu did not help my indecisiveness, everything is equally good and largely portioned. I loved the country style potatoes, the seasoning is perfect so I recommend getting that if you can as a side.  Don't forget to bookmark this place or the yolks on you!",

When we got there there were people standing outside to get in... the reviews we saw said they seem to get people in quickly.   Totally True, I thought it was going to take a long while, it may have been 15 mins.  This is a place we would go to again and again.",

It was a very filling meal! I think by ordering the spinach I was able to clear my plate. I also had a tea, which came with a plate of lemons and honey containers.   Our server Raul was amazing! He had us laughing and was on top of our orders! We had him split our table into 5 checks, and he did it with a smile. He made our first time visit here that much better! He also have us all free muffins as it was our first visit.  Plenty of parking and there is a large outside patio. The inside is decently large, cozy and homie feeling. Very nice :)  I recommend coming here if you want a filling and good meal. The menu is huge, there are so many options. You're bound to find something you'll enjoy.",

Because I'd never had it elsewhere, maybe I'm a little biased - but I know good food!  The second time I had the chili omelet. Uhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh delicious. They have a meat/no meat option, which is cool. And obviously I opted for the meat option. It was all cooked perfectly.  My favorite item has to be the potatoes though. Perfect little square-cut potatoes that are seasoned with what I can only describe as a mixture of the Red Robin's burger seasoning and tiny little kicks to your mouth. It's spicy but...not, if that makes sense? Probably not. You really just to go in and try.  Some plates come with what they call diabla sauce and it's delicious but beware - they charge $1 for extra.  Another plus: you get a choice of toast or muffins and I think last time I was there I counted six different bread options LOL. Plenty of variety! And the menu is insane. Trust me, it will be hard to choose.",

    "text": "How I'd never heard of Egg&I until last night, I'll never know. I love off-Strip, local establishments where I can get my grub on, and this is definitely on my list now.   I intended to get my butt up at 5 am and be at their door at 6 am when they opened, but my brain determined I needed sleep more than food and I ended up putting my name down at noon-thirty, at the height of brunch/lunch time. I was told the wait was about 15 minutes; I waited a solid 20 (which isn't bad when \"15 minutes\" usually serves as code for half-an-hour) and was promptly greeted by my wonderful server. I had my food about 10 minutes after I placed my order.  My late uncle was a gourmet chef, and my earliest, fondest memories of Vegas revolve around eating his cooking. Biscuits and gravy were on the usual menu when my family and I made our annual road trip out here, and I have purposely shied away from ever ordering it because nothing could ever come close.  But, for some reason, I ordered it anyway here. Was it as good as my Uncle Ray's?   Does the free show in front TI have anything to do with pirates anymore?  Exactly. But that said, I would probably order it again. I regret not remembering my server's name, but she's one of the best I've had in a LONG time, and as someone that waited tables and bartended her way through school, my standards of service are ridiculously high. She was awesome, and was warmer, more attentive and professional than any server I've had elsewhere in Vegas, even in those pretentious \"five-star\" restaurants you'll find in abundance in this city.  Keep in mind they're open from 6 am - 3 pm. I was told by a girl at the host desk that the best time to go was 6-8 and after 1:30.  Overall value?  Price: 3.5 Service: 5 Ambiance: 4  = 4.17. But Yelp! doesn't offer a decimal rating. So a solid four stars from me. Worth visiting at least once if you want a tasty meal in a casual atmosphere without the pretentious attitude.",

Both were amazing! The eggs benedict at Egg & I is one of my top favorite!! The Egg Crepe is similar to an omelet but the eggs are cooked crepe style. Both of our dishes came with seasoned potatoes, which were AWESOME!! They were so good that I bought a bottle of their seasoning. They have bottles of the potato seasoning and blackening dust for meats for $6 each.",

We came in around 10:45-11 and waited for about 15 minutes so I would say any later and you'll probably be waiting 30+ minutes..It started getting pretty busy right after we put our name down.   2. If you are waiting in line, check out their menu cause they have a LOT of choices.   3. Wear a sweater/sweatshirt - I know were in Vegas but the place was blasting the AC. Even our waitress had a sweatshirt on.   4. Order a banana bread muffin, its moist and fresh and a great snack. I ordered one after our meal because I was stuffed from my plate   5. If you know you can't eat a whole plate of food, get the HALF order. Of course our waitress told us AFTER we finished.   6. The pancakes were the best part of my meal - order them! Only complaint was that they served it with that fake syrup. (I'm from the East coast, I'm a little spoiled)  7. My sister didn't really care for the cinnamon toast french toast - they didn't look that great either  It was a solid breakfast for a lazy morning, I think next time I would try one of their egg-dishes since they are called Egg & I   YELP 365: 163/365",

I actually go by there a couple times a month just to pick up their famous banana muffins, which my son devours!  I've ordered their oatmeal, their scrambles, their wonderful blueberry pancakes that they make with multi-grain (or was it whole wheat?). I'm not sure if I ever ordered anything that wasn't good.  Their service has been great so far. They have that nifty system of turning your egg sign on your table if you need service. I'd have to say their wait staff has always been efficient and attentive.  We often frequent Egg Works, Cracked Egg, I'm not sure if it's all owned by the same company. Their menus are slightly different, some serve coffee cakes, some serve muffins. You can't really miss with either one, they are all delicious.  Highly recommend for your family-friendly casual breakfast/brunch. Beware like many great breakfast places, the weekends get pretty busy, especially Sunday during the church rush. Definitely worth it :)",

It was a crowded Sunday morning but we only waited about 10 mins.     We had the chicken enchilada omelette and the stuffed French toast.    Both were OMG!!    The omelette had grilled chicken, green chilies, enchilada sauce, cheese  and sour cream.    Came with crunchy potatoes.    Stuffed French toast was filled with sausage, eggs, cheese and topped with powdered sugar.     Unique combination and it all worked.    Waitress was very fast and super friendly!   Thanks for a great meal.",

    "text": "This was probably the best spot we hit on a recent trip to vegas.  It's always a good sign when a place is packed midweek.  We were sat immediately and there was no wait to receive drinks and menus.  Our waitress was Chance and quite honestly one of the best servers I've had in a long time. She knew her menu and was open to giving suggestions. She was also VERY attentive and upbeat in general. during a pretty good breakfast rush, mind you! Firstly, as I said before, it's busy. But you never have to flag down a waitress or ask when your order is coming. There's a little sign on the table which lets you flip between a happy egg and a frowny egg. If the frowny egg is showing, the waitress/waiter is supposed to help you right away. I never had to use this sign because the service was so prompt.  First thing I loved was the bottomless cup of coffee. You're given a full thermos pitcher of coffee all for your table and there's plenty of sugar (or substitutes) and cream at hand.  I usually ask for a recommendation on what to order when traveling and Chance was eager to help. She told me about the Chile Relleno Benedict and said that it's not normally on the menu (special days only) but that it really was a must try. Honestly, I'm not huge on chile relleno but hey she seemed enthusiastic and I went ahead and ordered it.  It was amazing. And it SHOULD be an everyday menu item. I'll go into both dishes and what was so awesome about them below.  Chile Relleno Benedict: Wow. The dish was amazing. Benedicts make just about anything better but this was no joke. REALLY well thought out and balanced. First thing I noticed was that the eggs were PERFECTLY poached. The whites were soft but not slimey or runny. There was zero cooked yoke. It was warm and ran smooth just the way god intended.  I don't know what was breaded in the dish but it was either the Chile itself or the thinly sliced (and tender as all hell) chicken breast. The breading was really what made the dish I think. It added just enough saltiness that I didn't need to add salt or pepper to my breakfast. I always add salt and pepper (unless I get chicken fried steak) and that was a pleasant surprise. The chile and the chicken were topped off with the poached eggs and hollandaise sauce. There were home fries on the side which also needed no seasoning beside what was already there but honestly I would have been ok just eating the chile relleno benedict. It was really that good.  My GF ordered the veggie pesto sandwich with Cajun fries. I didn't try the sandwich itself but she said the bread was very tender and the pesto was really tasty. I DID sneak a few fries however and loved them. Thinly cut shoestring style potatoes covered in seasoning. Another instance where salt was not necessary. Really they would have been fine without ketchup.  I fully intend on visiting this place every time I head to Las Vegas and can't say enough good things about it. Thank you Chance for the awesome recommendation and thank you Egg & I for turning out exceptional food and service at a great price!",

    "text": "I'll preface this review with the fact that I am NOT a breakfast person. I don't love anything about it. Except when I visit the Egg & I. And let me tell you ... it became a weekly event after a while.  I can't turn down fresh squeezed OJ. This restaurant has delicious OJ. You should try it at least once. I love their menu. They have interesting combinations, like chicken, pesto, and eggs, and delicious twists on common breakfast dishes, like French toast. I love the scrambles the most, and would  often get the veggie scramble sitting atop ranch potatoes. Slather that mound with hot sauce and call it a day. Expect an exhilerating food coma to follow. The portions are big. I also recommend trying their complimentary banana nut muffin at least once. I don't like muffins or bananas, seriously, but I like theirs. Be adventurous, don't order eggs and a side of bacon. Live it up a little...  Super awesome service. Expect to wait on the weekends for breakfast/brunch, but they have a quick turn-around and great waiters/waitresses. A nice perk to the crowded atmosphere is an egg on the table that you can flip when you require service. On a very busy day it's very helpful to the staff, and don't be afraid to use it! I've always had friendly, impeccable service here ... no complaints. I've brought every out-of-town guest here for breakfast, and we've always left happy. Stop in and give it a try!",

The menu consists of a variety of eggs benedict dishes, omelettes, hash, and other breakfast items.  Service is homey and the vibe is definitely casual here.  The menu comes out printed on newspaper stock so perhaps their items change frequently.  We started out with their signature banana nut muffin which accompanies many of their dishes.  Light, soft, fluffy, and not too sweet, the banana nut bread was a hit and a great starter.  Our entrees included a mish-mash of their popular dishes:  Prime Rib Benny (or Benedict) - the highlight dish entree was an Eggs Benedict version made up of prime rib.  It replaces the traditional muffin with a croissant and is definitely a large portion so was plenty to share.  Florentine Benedict - a version made with spinach and ham.  Pretty good.  Chicken Fried steak - I only had a few bites, but I liked it.  It's a calorie killer though.  Kay's Omelette - another signatuer omelette, it had plentiful cheese, ham, and egg.  Kinda plain and not sure why this is so popular.  You could make similar omelettes at home.  Brad's Chili - wasn't sure which chili to order and was recommended this one.  It came out lukewarm, had a bland flavor and was generally forgetabble.   Eggs & I is a decent brunch spot, but I wouldn't go out of my way to go here.  They take credit cards, including American Express.",

Seasoned potatoes are awesome!!! Banana muffin OH. MY. GOD. Delish! Atmosphere was great and friendly. Our waiter was great (don't remember her name which is probably good due to the fact she gave us two free muffins....don't want her getting in trouble, hehe. She was amazing though! Even tho I heard the muffin was good i settled for toast, and she brought me one anyway!

One server Erin came to our table shortly there after to take our order and answer any questions we had.  My wife doesn't eat regular sausage and we were very impressed with the vast ability to substitute. We were here for breakfast, but I peeked at the lunch menu and you can build your own burger with ground beef, chicken breast, turkey, or a vegetable patty.  I had the fiesta green chili skillet and it was amazing.  Perfectly spiced and filling.   My wife had a burrito and substituted turkey sausage and fruit.  We each got one of the banana bread muffins which I highly recommend. Erin was our server and she was very attentive and pleasant.  This was a nice way to start the day.  I highly recommend making this past of your Vegas stay.",

And their famed banana nut muffin was maybe too hyped up, so my expectations were not in line with what I actually tasted.  Not to say that it wasn't good. You do get a lot of food for the money though, considering you're in Vegas, so it's a steal. And the service was very friendly, like being in a diner where everyone knows your name. So if you're looking for a fix of good old fashioned, artery-clogging American breakfast, this would be a good option in Vegas if you don't want to break the bank in a casino establishment.",

    "text": "At a little before 7am on a Sunday morning, the place was almost deserted.  This was a little worrisome, but we soon realized that this said far more about the Vegas population than it did about the quality of the breakfast.  Here's the best recommendation I can give about the food: I came back for breakfast the next day!  And we would have come back the third morning except that we had to be on the road before they opened at 6am!  We got off to a good start.  When the waitress found out this was our first visit, she brought us a warm banana nut muffin to try.  It's a house special and well worth getting.  When you open up the newspaper-like menu, the first thing you'll notice is the words Habla Diablo in blazing red appearing in the descriptions of at least half the dishes.  My wife wanted the Spinach Benny, but was concerned about the Habla Diablo potatoes because the name sounded spicy and she's a self-proclaimed spice wimp.  The waitress explained that it wasn't spicy at all, that Habla Diablo is the owner's side company and he had just redone the menu to emphasize his products.  My wife went ahead with her spinach benny and I got the loco moco, with an extra side of the Habla Diablo potatoes.  (It turns out that the Habla Diablo seasoning is a lot like Lawry's Seasoned Salt.)  My wife really liked her spinach benny, but didn't care for the potatoes.  (But she's not a big fan of breakfast potatoes to begin with.)  I liked the potatoes and finished most of hers in addition to mine.  Plus the loco moco was the best I've had on the mainland!  The next day, I came back on my own, but with orders to bring back something good to my wife in the hotel.  This time I had the Biscuits & Gravy, which were great.  But, fair warning, they were pretty salty -- well within my tolerance, but if you are sensitive to salt, you might want to steer clear.   Then I picked out the California Crepe for my wife, which the waitress was happy to pack up for me to take back.  I asked to substitute some fruit for the Habla Diablo potatoes, and she packed up a huge container of fresh fruit.  My wife loved the California Crepe, except for one thing -- it was way too big for her to finish!",

There were many people waiting outside, so we were a little hesitant about wait time but getting sat took less than 10 minutes.  He ordered The Original Breakfast Burrito. It was very tasty and a good size. About 7\" long and 3\" diameter. The stuffing was tasty and just the right spice, the sauce on top was delicious.   I ordered the Works Veggie Benny. The vegetables were great, English muffins toasted well but not so much that they hurt your mouth while you're eating. Eggs were perfectly cooked (I am so crappy at cooking eggs that this always amazes me). My only complaint was that I wasn't super happy with the hollandaise which is 75% of why most people order Eggs Benedict (I think).   Both came with habla diablo seasoned potatoes which were very tasty. Both of us finished our plates.   Drinks: Soda and unsweetened iced tea.  Bill: $27",

Karla was excellent, she we barely awake and had issue ordering and she was patient and wonderful.   I even got muffins to go for the couple of days   Trust me when I say there nothing on this menu and isn't less than perfect.  I am in love w the piggy skillet, the strawberry French toast is great too !  Chicken enchilada for breakfast is out of this world.   The hardest thing about egg and is deciding what to order. ! But always get a banana nut muffin is a must have staple !!   Thanks for a great morning Karla !!",

Our waitress Liza was extremely attentive and a pleasure to have serve us. One of the runners asked if we needed anything and we asked for more tortillas. Then about 5 min later he came out with the tortillas and a loaf of banana bread as an apology for taking too long.  Which we thought was very nice even though it didn't take long at all.  We will definitely be eating here again. Thank you to our server and the staff!",

Like if they just take it one notch up it could be great. All of there food is mush there is no texture I got the California crepe and idk how they call that a crepe it was way too think but the filling inside was good. While my boyfriend got one of the burritos but he could only eat half because the inside was throwing him off. On the other hand the service is great and I like how they have a lot of different kinds of creamers. It's the little things that count. This time around I got the strawberry cream cheese French toast and my boyfriend got a scramble the one with jalapenos and chorizo I like his more than my own because they used the pre-made strawberry flavored cream cheese so it just tasted like fake strawberries but the strawberry compote that was also on it was delicious. His omelette was very tasted but the chorizo bits were so small I couldn't even taste it. Overall it's a good experience and a nice little cozy breakfast place that's close to home",

Turns out, we've eaten here before as well.  It's really good, portions are plenty from a guy who likes big portions.  I had the chicken fried steak breakfast and my wife had the stuffed French toast with sausage.  Telling the truth, I was really looking for something that came with pancakes because I like a big breakfast, this place really didn't have many options.  It didn't need it.  You get a mountain of little diced up potatoes that are nuggets of seasoned fried heaven, large main potions that pancakes would put you in food coma.  Coffee is really the only thing that I would say could be better.  Good, but not spectacular.",

Got to go last week and it was so good my mom wanted to eat there 2 days in a row! and my mom NEVER eats anywhere 2 days in a row.  highlights: giant portions, strong coffee, FAST SERVICE.  First day I ordered biscuits and gravy with potatoes and eggs. Was a little weirded out by the orange potatoes but when mixed with the gravy they were very good. The biscuits are freshly made and are amazing! Coffee was really good and strong here too.  I was very curious for the Cincy chili and got a side of that but I had to taste it and take it to go. It was AWESOME. Brought it home and ate it on a hot dog! AWESOME.  the service here was VERY fast and it was great but definitely hard for everywhere else we ate in Vegas to live up to.  lets see my other families food choices were all GIANT and everyone was really happy which is very unusual for us.  Second day I ordered the spam, rice and eggs. I think they called it Hawaiian special. Of course it was great. My niece tried the apple cinnamon pancakes but they were seriously big enough for 4 people to split. I think she finished 1 whole pancake. VERY fluffy and good.",

    "text": "Love this spot for a nice Sunday Brunch!  ...And I am obviously not the only one in town who feels the same way.  Its always nice to know that a place you love so much is appreciated by others, and thats the feeling you get as you pull into the Egg and I on Sahara. Immediately you will notice a group of people waiting patiently outside of the restaurant for the next available seat. When I go, being a smoker, I usually go out on the patio to enjoy the fresh air and a smoke with my coffee and book. The staff is so welcoming. I am a frequent visitor so they know where I would like to sit, escort me to a table of my choosing, provide an ashtray, and offer the heating lamp if it is cold outside. Always friendly, you are not just communicated with by your server, but others in the staff that notice your presence. Nobody walks around with blinders on. You feel as if they are there to enjoy your breakfast with you.   Speaking of the breakfast; it is the best in town! The wait is never long, and the food is always fresh and hot. Makes one wonder what kind of army is stacked away in the kitchen. Spinning out plate after plate of unique dishes that dont only taste great, but are piled high on your plate, makes me want to walk into the kitchen and give its staff a huge hug. There is something on the menu for everyone's taste, and, unlike many chain breakfast places who will remain unnamed, you actually get fresh ingredients, and flavor without frou frou toppings of berries and whip cream to try and doll it up. I find myself looking at others plates and wondering what they are having with delicious anticipation of trying it the next time. My signature dish is Brads Special, and I almost never stray from a favorite, but the fact that I feel safe to do so at The Egg and I says a lot.  A pleasant \"hello how are you\" greets you at the door, and a friendly \"Thank you, have a nice day\" assures a future visit. If The Egg and I added a few floors atop its building, and offered rooms like a Bed and Breakfast, you better believe there would never be an available occupancy.",

I just happened by this place on a Saturday morning.  There was a 15-20 minute wait for a table, which can be an annoyance, or it can be an excellent endorsement for patience.  My wife had a four-egg multi-cheese omelette, and tiny as she is, she ate every bit, washing it down with coffee (that was attentively refilled!).  It came with choice of potatoes and a super-delicious muffin.  I had a specialty omelette that was filled with spicy veggies and cheese.  When it came time to kick the spuds to the side, the waitress offered fruit, tomatoes, or fruit and tomatoes!  The fruit was chosen, fresh, sliced, and nicely arranged.  I had the coffee too, and the waitress was never stingy when more creamers were requested.  Such good service.  I can see why this place has people waiting for a seat.  This place has the best egg-dish menu I've ever seen.  The price of most dishes is in the $10.00 or less range.  They have plasma TV's strategically placed on walls, so you can watch sports if the conversation crashes.  It's all good. This is the best non-buffet breakfast I've had in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "Let's be honest here: the whole Vegas breakfast buffet phenomenon gets really old really fast.  Yes, it's all you can eat for $9.99, but how much can you really eat?  And how much do you want to eat every single morning?  Don't you want someone to bring you food instead of trying not to spill your bowl of oatmeal on a slow 80-year-old grandma in an \"I live to bingo\" sweater?  If you do, take a short drive down W. Sahara Ave to Egg and I.  You will not be disappointed.  Inconspicuously located in a nondescript strip mall, Egg and I provides a perfectly casual, hearty and homey breakfast without the pompousness and the hoopla of The Strip.  By now you're probably wondering what \"Egg\" looks like.  Well, Egg looks kind of like Humpty Dumpty, and \"I\" looks just like \"Egg.\"  Just look on their website.  Might as well call the whole place \"2 Eggs,\" although it would probably detract from the restaurant's country kitchen charm.    We came in around 9:30 am on Saturday morning, and the place was absolutely packed.  We got a table right away, but every party that came in after 9:45 had to wait a little.  We had just gotten into town, and I was glad they brought us a whole pot of coffee.  You'd better believe I took advantage of the proximity and the unlimited availability of good coffee.  Even the yellow cups with the company logo were cute enough to use at home.  We couldn't quite decide on what to order, and our waitress graciously waited, while offering valuable suggestions along the way.  The menu is extensive and the portions are huge, so....  Also, breakfast is the most important meal of the day, so you don't want to make this decision lightly.  There was nothing light about my breakfast, however.  The Ultimate Skillet is not for the weak...that much I know.  A generous layer of breakfast potatoes had a Cajun flavor to it.  Paprika and something else gave those potatoes a light crunch and a reddish hue - pretty and delicious.  The Ultimate Skillet also featured mounds of sausage, ham and bacon, mixed in with bell peppers, onions and cheese.  The skillet wouldn't be complete with 2 scrambled eggs on top.  WOW.    We also ordered one large pancake to share, but after getting through 3/4 of the skillet, I wasn't hankering for a pancake.  I did try it, and it was fluffy and sweet, but it was just too much.  I was ready to throw in the towel, which almost never happens to me.  On any other day, I can finish any breakfast, and have some of yours, too, but the Ultimate Skillet proved to be a bit much.  Order at your own risk.  That's a LOT of food for $9.95.  Great breakfast in a quaint setting?  I will be sure to make it my regular Vegas breakfast destination.",

    "text": "My in-laws came to visit for Father's Day weekend (2016) and on Saturday June the 18th my father-in-law wanted a worthy hefty breakfast badly. We all got halfway through our meals and almost needed to go boxes already so hefty indeed especially with the seasoned potatoes they serve with most of the meals. We decided to give Egg & I a try and we are in awe! MY father-in-law had the Blackened prime rib benny and he automatically fell in love. My husband had the Cordon bleu skillet as he is a huge cordon bleu fan and he now knows exactly where to go to have such a delicious breakfast. I had the Cabo breakfast burrito, the sauce that covered it went extremely well with the burrito. I am a HUGE fan of Banana muffins so of course I got one before our meals came, we all shared it and it came warm and SO soft. When we arrived it was full house WITH a couple families waiting in front of us. Not even 10 minutes and we were seated. Not even an hour and we were on our way out the door fed, bill paid and happy while it was STILL packed, fast service. Only one thing, you guys should get bigger Orange juice cups, it's about half the size of the water cups and it's good juice so it was gone in 2 mins.",

    "text": "I haven't been to an Egg & I/Egg Works since I was in Arizona back in '07.  I love this place!!   It's one of those bfast places where there are mugs on the table and the server brings you a giant pot of coffee and leaves it with you at your disposal.  There were different types of pre-packaged cream and sugars, including hot sauces, ketchup, and a little egg sign which you can flip over if you need servicing.  Not as ingenious as the button at Korean bbq places, but it works!  Most entrees come with a side of toast or homemade banana nut muffin.  I'm not a big fan of banana nut but my god, theirs is just divine. Spongey, soft, moist, slightly sweet and with just the perfect flavor of fresh banana flavor and a little hint of crunch from the nuts.  The nuts aren't bitter either, as some walnuts can be and it was just pure perfection.  BH and I went a little buckwild (as we always do) and we ordered three dishes: eggs benedict florentine, a half order of corned beef hash, and the stuffed french toast with eggs and bacon.  The benedict was awesome and was smothered in creamy hollandaise sauce.  The eggs were soft and runny but the English muffin was still crispy and chewy.  The stuffed french toast was pretty good.  BH gobbled up the entire plate whereas I had just a bite or two.  I thought there was too much egg and not enough bacon, but BH told me it was great with maple syrup.  I like sweet meats and breads, but I haven't gotten accustomed to sweet scrambled eggs yet, so I never tried it dipped in sticky sweet maple. Finally, the corned beef hash was very fresh and I could definitely tell it was homemade and not from a can.  The chunks of potato were creamy and starchy while the chunks of meat were flavorful, salty, and a little reminiscent of dog food (but in a good way).  The over easy egg on top made it even more delectable.  Finally, one of the best parts of the meal, besides the banana nut muffin, were their ranch potatoes.  They are roasted to a perfect crunch and seasoned with some sort of red powder - possibly paprika for a bit of smokiness?  They were so damn good, that even past my stuffing point, I kept stabbing at the potatoes so I could get every last bit in my mouth.  Needless to say, BH  and I were nearly bursting by the time we left Egg & I.  I call that a sign of good breakfast and a good start to a day.",

What SEPARATES the eggs here from other breakfast joints is the foods we tried were prepared with care and were NOT GREASY , YEAH success! and they offer many things that surprise you that are different that you won't see anyplace else also VERY REASONABLY PRICED .  No yoke we had the chile Relleno omelet  (a whole green chili stuffed with cheese inside your omelet covered with sauce and cheese) and the chorizo skillet eggs  , both were enough for two people each and both were tasty delish! I picked the house made banana muffin over the toast and it was a really GOOD real banana muffin not a mix .  This place cracks me up , they are GOOD eggs!",

Catherine's Scramble: chicken, mushrooms, spinach, feta and artichokes.  I was sold on all the ingredients and the dish was amazing and flavorful.  Bacon, avocado and cheese omelette: full of bacon flavor and packed with avocados.  Usually when I get avocado with my omelette it is served sparingly with just a few pieces on top.  They were not stingy with it and filled it completely.  Corned beef hash: the good stuff, not canned corn beef.  Eggs and toast were included.  All the dishes were served with a side of ranch potatoes, which is amazing in itself.  I would eat the potatoes alone!   Priced well with large portions.  I will definitely be back to try other dishes.     .",

Not crispy melts in your mouth kind.  Will not order this again.  Will go back but will try egg dishes next time we are in Las Vegas again",

The menu has so much to choose from.  My friend ordered the parfait cup with fruits, granola and yogurt.  She said it was quite tasty. I chose the plain French toast w/turkey sausage, maple syrup and apple compote. They were perfectly done. Our waiter was attentive and the noise level was not at all overwhelming.  I will definitely recommend and will come back again. Oh yes, and the banana nut muffin was every bit as good as others had mentioned. It comes warm and soft to the table. Worth the trip all by itself with a glass of juice.  I would definitely recommend to others and will go back either there or one of the other restaurants owned by same Chef in Summerlin.",

Had the ham and cheese omelette which was a very generous size and could be easily shared as it comes with a muffin or toast, and potatoes. Yum! My son had the chocolate chip pancakes. Need I say more? Sorry, don't remember what hubby had but I know it was good. Can't go wrong at this place. Prices reasonable considering the portion sizes are HUGE!",

Waited about 10 minutes and we were seated at a table with a waitress ready to take our order. Started with coffees and they gave a full thermos! A nice touch so we can pour our own refills. The table has a simple system to flip a sign if you need anything and the waitress comes right over. We each got the free muffins with the check in, and they are delicious! Moist, not too sweet, and great with coffee. We both ordered a skillet entree and they were great. Only critique being they come with a lot of sauce on top, so maybe ask for less or on the side. The GF's sauce was a salsa and it over powered the dish. Mine was more of a cream/cheese sauce, and I could've used a touch less. Other than that the meals were delicious, the service was awesome, and the atmosphere is great. They kindly filled up our water bottles so we'd stay hydrated while hiking. On our way out the line was still long, but they're efficient operation is worth the short wait!",

    "text": "After seeing and hearing so much great stuff about this place we decided to try it. We came in on a late Sunday morning for breakfast. We didn't know we should have called ahead to be placed on \"the list\". So our estimated wait time for amy seating for 2 was 45 minutes. We gave our info and waited for our turn to be seated.  We observed the hostess be informed several times there were multiple open tables for 2, 3, or 4 guests. Yet she didn't send messages to the waiting customers until she was told by multiple people several times about the open tables.  After we were seated our server was good. She gave us enough time to look at the menu and place our orders.  My husband had the chicken fried steak and I had a savory crepe (I don't know the name). Our food came out fairly quickly for how busy the place was. Husband said his food was great. Mine was okay. I was thinking the turkey was going to be cubed not shredded. The guacamole inside the crepe was good. The spicy potato cubes that came on the side were good.  Only real bummer about the service was that the bloody Mary I ordered never came out. Our server realized this about the time I was finishing my food.  Overall this was a cute fun place to go. Totally recommend calling to get on the list if you plan to visit on a weekend. Don't expect to be seated right away even when you get a text your table is ready",

I got the shredded corned beef hash with eggs.  WOW is all I can say. So good, exactly what I wanted.   For the price, the portions are large.  Total deal.  Hazelnut coffee was fabulous.    The menu is huge, so if eggs aren't your thing there is plenty of other things on the menu to pick.  That was probably the hardest thing for us - was to actually pick something off the huge menu.    Clearly this a locals place, it's off the strip in a strip mall.  We missed it when we were driving there.",

I wish I had tried the muffin, I looked around with envy as everyone around us had one!  My husband had the stuffed french toast, and absolutely loved the cook on it.

The menus are newspapers and the servers are friendly!  Food (4 Stars): I ordered the corned beef hash with over medium eggs and the banana nut muffin. I'm usually not a banana nut fan, but this muffin changed my mind. It was full of spice and flavor, you can definitely taste the banana. The corned beef hash was pretty good with the shredded style corned beef. The seasoned potatos were DELICIOUS and I wish I could've had more.  We ordered the Cinncinati 4 Way plate with onions. It is pretty much spaghetti pasta with chili and onions on top. Our group was intrgued by the ingredients so we ordered it. It was amazing!!! Who knew that chili and spaghetti pasta can go together so well?? Topped with cheese and onions, this is my dish!  We couldn't finish all of our food due to the large portions, so definitely come with an appetite. The food is still good after being reheated.  Service (4 Stars): Our cute server was friendly and humorous. She frequently checked up on us and refilled our cups, she even got us another table because ours was cramped.  Bottom line: Hungover? Hungry? Feeling like stuffinf your face? Egg ans I will satisfy it all.",

The Bloody Mary and coffee were both good! On our table we had huevos rancheros, the biscuits and gravy and the avocado bacon omelette--all were great. Portions were more than fair and the food was fresh and tasted delicious! We will definitely head back here on our next Vegas trip!",

Sometimes being on the strip is just too congested and I crave some sense of normalcy... and buffets are just too much food and too expensive.  Hence I visited the Egg & I.  And it was closed.  Computers Down. :(  When I was finally able to return I looked through my newspaper style menu and was torn between the biscuits and gravy or a omelet.  I tried the artichoke omelet and sub'd for some mushrooms.  I love the fetta cheese on top and the fresh tomatoes.  One thing that lacked... I couldn't taste the artichoke... and it could probably use more mushrooms.  It was a great idea however probably would taste better with bacon and mushrooms or ham or something to that effect... Something you can actually taste.  The potatoes were really good, home fries... and more of a fries taste since they had a TON of seasoning on it.  I would prefer less seasoning, and have a bottle to the side if you want more.  Servers were very nice, there was a line of people waiting to be seated.  It was a good experience, I think I like Blueberry Hill more, but I wouldn't be opposed to returning here again.",

Definitely tasted the chipotle sauce and they gave a generous amount of turkey. However, I felt that they gave a little too much of the chipotle hollandaise sauce, and I felt that the sauce was a bit watery, which made the English muffin more on the soggier end : / I also tried their Classic Benny, and the sauce was similar! Nonetheless, they give a lot of Hablo Diablo seasoned potatoes, which can be taken to go! HAHAH I also love their banana nut muffin, which is free if you check in! Shout out to our server, she hooked us up with four muffins without checking in! LOL Service was pretty good. There can be a bit of a wait on weekends. There is parking in the lot.",

The coffee and orange juice were good and fresh. The server was friendly and delivered my order fast. I can't believe that a restaurant that has been around for so long makes the most horrid Corn Beef Hash that I have ever seen!

Check in to get a complimentary banana nut muffin! We really liked it; it was moist and tasty. They seem to be really popular among locals so make sure you get a taste! Also, shout out to our waitress Karla; she was super attentive and friendly!  A couple tidbits: they have a dog friendly patio, they have an egg-shaped thing on each table that you can flip when you need something from the waiter which is really convenient, you pay your bill at the front of the restaurant, and they sell pre-packaged containers of their seasoning at the front.   Speaking of the seasoning, I ordered the works omelette ($11.99) which was delicious and meaty which is just the way I like it but the star of the show was BY FAR the potatoes. They're so flavorful, addicting, and just seasoned so well. They're cut into small pieces so they're crispy and there's a ton of flavor packed in every bite. I couldn't stop myself from eating them and I constantly found myself thinking, \"These are some damn good breakfast potatoes, probably the best I've ever had.\" Some people might not like how it's seasoned so much, but I loved it.  This is now my go-to breakfast place in Vegas. It's not on the strip and would require a drive but it's worth for those potatoes.",

Make sure to check into yelp for a free muffin that's baked fresh! They have a spacious indoor area which can get pretty noisy and an outdoor patio. The service I'm sure is great if you're a regular or a familiar face, but whatever otherwise. If you pick to eat outside, just keep in mind you probably won't get checked on too frequency (could be good or bad depending on you)",

    "text": "After several days of eating at what the California and Main Street casinos had to offer, it was a relief to find a place that can cater to healthier (mind you, I didn't say healthy) choices when eating out.  It's a little off the beaten path if you're driving back to LA like we were.  You're heading north for about 5 or 6 miles to get brunch at Egg & I.    It's worth it.  Plenty of parking and this place was hopping by the time we left.  It was a Monday morning, too.  Our hostess and waiter were over the top friendly and patient.  I think they were kind of bummed no one wanted to sit out in the patio which would have been too cool if it weren't so cool.  The menu is meant to look like a newspaper, which is cute.  Lots and lots of choices so don't come here if you're indecisive!    They cater to portion as well as nutrition.  You can choose sliced tomatoes or cottage cheese on the side if you don't want to indulge in their signature potatoes, which looked great but we didn't try.  Mom won't eat runny yolks so she had a half portion (2 egg) vegetable omelet with sliced tomatoes and a banana nut muffin.  I had 2 eggs over medium with 2 turkey sausages, sliced tomatoes and dry wheat toast.  Everything was pretty good.  The eggs were cooked just right and the sausages were small but tasty especially when cut up with the tomatoes.  I made it into a sort of mini sandwich using the toast.  Mom's omelet was pleasing to her taste but I thought it was a bit heavy on the vegetables so that you could barely taste any egg!  Prices are way reasonable too.  We'd def hit them up again if we come back to lose money in Sin City.",

I had been to an Egg Works a couple of times before so it was not a surprise when I found the Hawaiian section of the menu having ordered from there previously. Instead of the plate with rice and Spam like I had eaten in the past I went with loco moco. There are actually two kinds here. A traditional loco moco with brown gravy and their version with country gravy. I went traditional. It was delicious. A little heavy on the salt but it would seem wrong without that. But the beef was perfectly cooked to medium as I requested. The over easy eggs had just enough runny yolk to mix in. I think every bite I took had a bit of everything.  Plates here come with a little side so I got a banana nut muffin. Those are just too good to pass up. And my plate came with a slice of pineapple. I did not leave a crumb. It was all so good. I ate so fast that I had to wait for my waitress to come back with my check. She wasn't expecting me to eat so fast.  Honestly, though, I was not in a hurry to pay for breakfast. At $9.99 the loco moco is one of the cheaper menu items. I was actually kind of surprised at the prices here. You do get a good portion of quality food at The Egg and I, though. Worth it? From time to time, sure.",

My sister and I shared the bacon French toast and let me tell you, it was so yummy that we finished the half order before our entree arrived.  The warm French toast was accompanied with a bacon type butter and whipped cream.  I thought about the diet I was supposed to be on, but only for a nano second.  I ordered a breakfast sandwich on a brioche bun.  It was filled to the max with thinly sliced ham, egg, and American cheese with a side of potato.  Presentation was good, potatoes has their own spice on it and it was delish!!  My sandwich was a little dry so had to ask for some mayo.  My sister had the chili omelette and it also had a side of potatoes.  Her chili was good, and both orders had a large amount of food.  Overall her omelette was good and she also said that the potatoes was very good.  Overall food was good and prices reasonable.  Service from entering the restaurant to serving us to paying the bill was great.  Our waitress was attentive, professional, and checked in on us throughout our meal.  Would definitely come back when in Vegas.",

Lol)  TRY THE BANANA NUT MUFFIN!!! Its the lightest yet moist banana nut muffin.. I was so sold I bought the loaf $7.39 with tax for one ( I bought 4 lol for pasalubong (souvenirs .. ppl bring keychains I bring food ).  Use the free banana nut check coupon yelpers!!  THE MENU is ridiculous!  EGGSTRAVAGANZA (lol yup went there).. so many choices and you still have options to go lighter or low carb.  Want to go back to try their Hawaiian Menu (heard their Haole Loco Moco is the one to try)  Prime Rib Eggs Benny -  yummy diced cut prime rib (not chewy) well seasoned without being salty , I normally like hollandaise on the side but they forgot but I didnt mind as their hollandaise was really good.  Eggs cooked perfectly! Sauteed spinach went really well to balanced out all the richness .  The croissant was really good but got soggy fast!   Cornbeef Hash - was homemade but didnt have the extra to make it standout .  Recommend to get the chicken and chorizo hash instead.  THE POTATOES!!! - Habla Diablo seasoning which isn't spicy .. basically salt,  paprika, garlic seasoning <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhabladiablo.com%2Fproduct%2Fpotato-seasoning%2F&s=6b6ef8b4bd5134ab7b9b477bc8fb3cf22f09b04a287468aafc67e9562c4dbb44\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">habladiablo.com/product/...</a> SOOOO NICE AND CRUNCHY TOO !! So ONO!!!  Coffee was great- medium light (not bitter) they leave your a carafe at the table.  SERVICE - Excellent Manuela was great very friendly and kept checking on us.  Everyone working there were super friendly.",

For me at least, they were perfectly cooked and seasoned. Potatoes are my top food because they compliment any meal. They had a homemade salsa which had great flavor and best if all, I had a free banana muffin for checking in on yelp. The service was great. Holly was  super helpful and attentive to our table. Definately with the ten minute drive from the strip. They do have a little wait, but hang In there and you will definitely be pleased.",

We ordered 2 of the items that our waitress recommended. I was torn between getting the veggie Benny and the Mexican omelette. I decided to try the Mexican omelette and had a screwdriver. It was pretty yummy and the portions of food were huge! We also checked in and got a free banana nut muffin which was pretty yummy. No wonder this place has almost 5 stars.",

Lol instead of 4 egg omelette a you can request 2 eggs which is what I did with my Mexican Omelette. Soooooo smart!  Mexican omelette: 5/5 Really cheesy and good! Dollop of sour cream on top went good with the red enchilada sauce and jalapenos.   Island dish: 5/5 Hawaiian dish Portuguese Sausage link with two eggs (we got over easy) and scoops of rice. The flavor of the sausage was deliciously salty!  Banana Pancake: 5/5 Wow. The bananas were sweet and the pancakes FLUFFY! Damn good. I got a side of this and it was my perfect dessert.   Banana nut muffin: 5/5 FREE when you check-in on YELP!   Thank you for the delicious food and for the awesome service! 5 star everything!",

Anything too salty and i wont like the food) but this canadian bacon was perfect; not too salty. Eggs were nice and runny. Hollandaise sauce was flavorful. Fruit were far and few but I can't complain.   I checked into Foursquare and was treated to their banana nut bread/muffin. OMG it was sooo good.

Spots near Egg & I were full, but plenty spaces in the lot if you dont mind walking.  Service: The service was excellent! Our server was attentive and very nice. Although all our entrees did not come with the banana muffin, our server brought one for everybody! They even let us bring our Starbucks drinks in!   Food: The food was delicious. The banana muffin was light and fluffy. Super yummy! I also ordered the Chicken, Broccoli and Mushroom skillet (served with eggs, ranch potatoes, and cheese). It was also very good.

I really like he seasoning they use on them, and I think it makes it different than the same ol' potatoes you would get anywhere else.   This is very much like a diner that you would go to back home, and this is off the strip so the prices are reasonable too.   Will definitely return!",

The waitress was able to get his food to us so promptly, it definitely provided customer service that we were not expecting! Also just a tip, they have half orders on certain items - unless you're super hungry their food portions are humongous!",

My only complaint: they should make a real dairy product available on the table for coffee instead of your having to ask for it. They serve real butter, so why non-dairy creamer? Spock and I consider this \"illogical\". Still always 5 stars for me and I've been coming here since the 80's.",

    "text": "Seen this place so many times while driving and thought nothing of it.  Today was my first time inside for breakfast at 1:30pm.  So glad I finally stopped in!  All the reviews talk about their bannana nut muffin, but more on that later, first - the eggs...   I ordered the biscuits and gravy which comes with a side of 2 eggs (I chose scrambled) and a side of potatoes (the server allowed me to sub half of the potatoes for fresh fruit.  Everything on my large plate was done perfectly.  The eggs were warm, tasty, and not under or over done.  The biscuits were deliciously moist and puffy (best I've had in as long as i can remember) with a very nice sausage gravy.  The potatoes were original and had a nice texture but the seasoning was a bit much for my taste.  And the fresh fruit was very sweet and well, fresh!  I really don't have a single complaint about the food.  I'd go here regularly for breakfast if it were closer to my house.  For first time goers you get a banana nut muffin on the house.  I don't care if you aren't a big fan of banana nut muffins, I'm really not.  But just eat it!  You won't regret it.  I don't know what they put in this pastry (sprinkled crack maybe?) but it was amazing.  As far as  the employees go, they all seemed happy, smiling, and they were genuinely nice.  There was no wait for me although I heard i just missed a rush.  everyone from the hostess to the servers to the cook did everything just right in my opinion.  Prices are fair for breakfast.  My large plate with an iced tea came to eleven bucks and change.  More than what I'm used to paying for breakfast, but worthy for the quality of the feast, and I'd happily hand it over again.",

Good to know that when we took two friends to eat there on their recent visit, nothing has changed. Same huge menu; same great service; and same fantastic seasoned potatoes!  I had the bacon and avocado omelet, and my husband had the Cincy chili omelet, both with sides of potatoes (of course!). One of our friends ordered the Country Benny, and the other had an order of potatoes with a side of brown gravy. We all left pleased and sated, and my husband and I had leftovers as well!  Everything on the menu looks fantastic, but I suggest getting an egg dish (seeing how the name of the place is \"The Egg & I\"!) The \"Three Pigs\" and the mashed potato omelets are good bets, along with all the other items mentioned above. And definitely get the seasoned potatoes. Although my husband thinks they're overseasoned, I humbly disagree. To me, they're the best in town!",

First of all if you're the kind of person like me that can't decide on what to eat,you'll be in trouble, huge breakfast menu! The banana nut muffin is must when eating here, it's that good. I ordered the Cordon Bleu Skillet, which has their tasty seasoned potatoes lining the bottom of dish. It was a deceivingly filling and I was very Happy with my dish.  I can see why Egg & I is such a super popular place to eat no matter what time of the day. Excellent attentive friendly service with lots of parking makes this place a great choice.",

The prime rib was cut into little square chunks and was bland and dry to the taste. it didn't matter that it was covered and smothered in Hollindaise sauce and cheese either. Broke my heart :( lol. maybe I have to come in on a better day? It was quite  busy that Sunday. Waited about 25mins on the dot. they were very particular with the time which was great! They told me wait time was 25 they got me in, in 25. Kudos for the overall customer service, defiinitely! Extra star for that!",

    "text": "Tip: They let you call ahead for reservations as long as you have 6 or more in your party!  I ALWAYS end up eating here at least once every Vegas trip. The prices are reasonable and the portions are huge! The wait to get seated or to receive food is not long and all the waiters are pretty nice. Parking is never an issue since it's a big lot shared with other shops.   Note that for any entree that lists sides .. they let you swap out the sides! As in, you can change out what's listed there on the menu [took me a while to realize I could get fruit/salad/etc.]. I personally am a huge fan of their seasoned potatoes and omelettes.  Don't forget to check in in for a delicious banana nut muffin!",

    "text": "Quite possibly the saltiest eggs that have ever entered my mouth :(  The menu selection is overwhelmingly large with many different options but I opted for good ol traditional eggs benny. I'm not sure if they sprinkle their eggs each with individual cartons of salt...wouldn't be surprised cause everything was so salty. The hollandaise sauce also had an overbearing flavor and the ham was so. damn. SALTY. Everyone at my table was commenting on how salty the egg dishes were.  I really wanted to like this place because the servers were all so kind and attentive but my egg dish pretty much ruined it for me. The potatoes on the side however were prepared perfectly. Crispy and perfectly seasoned.   Nevertheless, I did enjoy the free banana nut muffin that came free with yelp check-in. Probably one of the best muffins I've ever had. Warm, toasty on the outside & moist on the inside. Mmmmm.  Had a small portion of friend's stuffed french toast which was pretty good. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing, but since this restaurant specializes in \"egg works\" I was not expecting to be let down by a classic eggs benny dish. I would give 5 stars for service and 3 for food.",

    "text": "Ok, imagine that you've just left South Orange County (Ladera Ranch to be specific) and you've made this great plan to beat the traffic in the Los Angeles area.  Part of the plan has you delaying breakfast until you get to Las Vegas, and the plan is working pretty well so far.  At Barstow you get out your phone and you begin to review the non casino options in Las Vegas when 'Egg and I' leaps out with these great reviews and a fantastic star rating.  Sold!  That's where we're going to go.  When we check-in on yelp we get a free Banana Nut Muffin, and things seem to be fantastic.  Our server is charismatic, checks in often, provides us with a pitcher of water (its something like 100 degrees outside and rising), and was efficient throughout the meal.  Our omelettes arrive in a timely fashion, and so what is their to complain about.    First, I like cheese, and so having cheese is always a good thing, and for you this may be a big plus, but there was so much cheese it was hard to taste anything else.  I had ordered the chile rellano omelette, and it arrived as advertised, but with just a ton of cheese.    Second, the potatoes looked to be cubed by a machine, frozen, de-frosted, and then lightly seasoned prior to arrival.  They were very disappointing.    Third, my expectations were way too high.  My fellow yelpers love this place, and so I was expecting this amazing breakfast that just didn't live up to my expectations.  In a nutshell, I'd probably go back, but with a whole different set of expectations, knowing that I'd ask for sliced tomatoes instead of the potatoes, and I'd probably not choose an omelette.  Be sure and check in, a free muffin is not a bad thing.",

They got it down here! Amazing customer service!  Of course, Vegas is extremely hot and we were in a rush to eat and leave, so we were flexible with our seating. Outside was fine, and that's where we ended up. The outside patio was hot due to the weather, but they had some machines that automatically blew out cold must which helped a little. OSCAR- (woot woot!) our server, was absolutely AMAZING and provided exceptional customer service, making out group feel very welcome. He was extremely knowledgeable and friendly, and gave us some great suggestions for breakfast and lunch. Our entire party was beyond satisfied with the service, friendliness, and quick arrival of our food. Oscar provided us with the best banana nut muffins, which were served warm with butter. I had the breakfast burger with a fried egg on top, a side of delicious seasoned fries. They also serve stuffed French toast, and you have the option of getting half country potatoes and fruit, instead of full order of one or the other. Food was delicious and we will definitely drop by the next time we visit the Strip. Hands down, this is one of the best breakfast places I have been to!",

The next time I come I need to make sure to get a box to go!  As for the breakfast plates, my boyfriend got the omelet and I got the usual potatoes ham and eggs. We also decided to get the \"short stack\" banana pancakes. Let me just tell you that when we asked just how big the short stacked pancakes were, the server made this hand gesture that indicated it was small so we went with that. Guys, the short stack was, STACKED. It was huge! It's bigger than the regular pancakes in Ihop and Denny's! Plus it had REAL bananas in them. Holy smokes!   We were IN LOVE with the potatoes! It had the best seasoning - a somewhat Cajun flavor? The ham was a large chunk and my boyfriend loved his omelet. This place is perfect! Would definitely come back for more!  10/10 would bang (the door) again",

I ordered the corned beef hash and what came wasn't your standard canned mushed beef stuff. There were real pieces of corned beef in this mixed with potatoes, onions, red, green peepers and topped with 2 eggs of your choice, which should always be over easy eggs with super sloppy running yolks. The flavors were spot on and the side of potatoes were nice.  The banana muffin that is served is awesome too.  It's probably microwaved before getting to your table but it's still very decent.  Prices are a little bit high like $10.95 for the hash and the wait can be long.  The annoying thing about this place is paying at the cashier!  When it's busy, the wait can be 10 minutes to pay your bill... minus a star for that.",

By the time we left nearing 10AM, there was a line out the door. Service was friendly and attentive. I was pretty disappointed with the food though. We ordered a veggie eggs benedict and a southwest (chicken/chorizo) hash. At first, the order for the eggs benedict came out wrong with canadian bacon and spinach vs. just all veggie. The waitress brought out extra banana nut muffins to apologize, which was a nice gesture especially since the best thing here was the banana nut muffin.  The hollandaise on the benedict was really watery and had a slight sweet taste to it. Overall, the benedict lacked flavor. On the other hand, the hash and the breakfast potatoes were extremely salty. We got the extremes here in terms of flavor (too salty and too bland). Overall, not bad, not great.",

On those hot summer Vegas days I see people waiting outside but I don't know... That is just not for me. When you want to go is before the weekend AM crowds have hit or on the off-hours. Then, walking in and getting a table is very easy.   Okay, now that the warnings have bee spelled out, let's get down to the restaurant. Inside, it is very Americana. Plus, the food is very Americana. Basically, what you see is what you get.   Ordering is easy. As the name of the restaurant suggests, it is eggs and things that go along with eggs. Simply as that. Make your choice and you are all good.   The staff is always nice and helpful is you have any questions. And, most of the times the other guest are nice though I have been here a few times when the restaurant was deluged with a rowdy or rude crew, however. But hey, this is Vega, what can you expect?   Eggs & I is attached to a large shared parking lot. I have never found parking to be a problem.   It is located on West Sahara, so finding it is easy.   Overall, very good restaurant. Fun and tasty place to eat.  Recommended!",

My mom had the sausage patties, eggs and potatoes. The potatoes had a bit too much seasoning salt for my taste, by everything else was amazing.  The service really took things up a notch. They have a stand on the table where you flip the egg over if you need service. Different servers stopped in and refilled our drink while we were eating. Our glasses never got less than half-empty.

Were were served by Thayrana who is getting married soon and was delightful. She gave us great and honest recos along with some complimentary banana nut muffins with her apologies when our food took a little bit longer than expected. Our most favorite dish was the pumpkin pancakes with chocolate chips! Highly recommend this place to all and apparently they have several locales as well!",

When i was finally seated, I was giving this big menu of items.  I ordered the southwest omelet & cup of coffee.  Once I received it, coffee was okay & the omelet was great.  Service was okay, but not great.  I guess because they were busy, it took longer for her to check on me especially to bring my check once I was done.  Overall the place has good food, but needs to work on service.",

It was served in a baking dish so I guess the restaurant feel compelled to fill it with sauce.  It was completely drenched in \"Hollandaise\" if you could even call it that.  It was creamy and yellow, yes.  But there was no butter taste, or lemon.  Moreover, the slice of ham on the benedict was so thick and strong flavored that it was the predominant flavor.    I ordered the HAM AND MUSHROOM SKILLET with TWO EGGS OVER EASY.  It's a baby skillet, with the bottom lined with the restaurant's ubiquitous Ranch Potatoes, mixed with diced ham, sliced mushrooms, topped with a handful of shredded cheese and topped with 2 eggs, any style.  It's all very salty, cheese, filling and pretty good actually.   FYI: the Ranch Potatoes are diced taters completely drenched in Lawry's seasoned salt and they use it anywhere potatoes might be needed.  The result is ..seasoned salt EVERYWHERE!  Stick with basics like pancakes and eggs and these skillet-y things.  Don't get anything where skill might be needed to cook it.",

Its beanless, sweet, smokey, & mouth watering delicious. I always have the 4-way, noodles, chili, cheese & onions. 5-way adds beans. I do not like kidney beans & dont like them forced into my chili. This dish is enormous & inexpensive. This dish is made with love, plain & simple. The entire staff is always welcoming. They know how to treat their regulars & irregulars.They have a prime rib benedict, health conscious items. When i eat there i am far from health conscious. i am down right unconscious & barbareick. They never laugh or stare when i have a couple entrees going at once. What can I say, options are hard cause there are so many good ones.",

We had the Banana Bread French Toast which was good, but had similar texture to the Banana Nut Muffin that came with it (should have gotten some other side dish). But don't get me wrong, both we're good. The muffin was served fresh from oven with steam coming out as you break it. We also got the avocado omelet with cheese and sour cream. This was good but what we really loved were the side of potatoes. Just the right amount of seasoning to keep you interested. Overall very good experience. Service was excellent.",

    "text": "Vegas. Two girls. Hungover. We had a long drive ahead but needed time to collect ourselves. In our dysfunctional state of mind, we decided we wanted brunch.  Off to Egg & I we went. The place turned out to be a local favorite. It was fairly packed, but we got seated right away. Extensive breakfast menu. Options! And loved how it was printed on newspaper!   Chicken Omelet (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=5jiBgyVg3dAhbE4X129pOw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdS...</a>): I can't remember its name, but I do remember that it was absolutely tasty! Chicken, cheese, avocado with sour cream on top. Moist chicken. Fluffy omelet. Yum!   Ranch Potatoes: Came with omelet. Addicting! Even though they were overly seasoned for my taste buds, I couldn't stop eating them.  Banana Nut Muffin (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=6JXT3ryRPelUwv5grDI67A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdS...</a>): Came with omelet. Gigantic homemade muffin. Chewy top. Soft inside with bits of banana and nuts. So good!  Eggs Florentine (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdSl5mo9dWC4clrQjEDGg?select=YvTvI5skrvIBBFC4W7TUVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/3kdS...</a>): I didn't try it. But judging by its looks, I would imagine it to be delicious!  Coffee: Great quality coffee. It was unlimited refill and I had the whole carafe to myself. They have their own line of coffee.   Huge portions!  We both packed half of our food to go. Great service! Friendly and attentive. And best of all, great prices! 2 breakfast entrees, 1 orange juice, 1 coffee, plus tax and tips all for $30! =D",

I had the pumpkin pancakes (which are not on the menu, so ask) which were so delicious that I didn't even need syrup.   My wife, who I love so much (just in case she reads this), is a finicky eater, and she wanted to come back the next day before we left (which we did). She got the skillet breakfast both times. Word to the wise, get a half order if you're not a big eater.  One last thing, went with friends so I tried the biscuit and gravy, stuffed french toast and two different skillet breakfasts. I would have been happy with any of these other orders.   Ok, I lied, this is the last thing, try the Habla Diablo verde on your food, it is very tasty. So much so, we bought a bottle to take with us.",

    "text": "We were in the area early in the AM and decided to get some breakfast and decided to try the EGG ASND I. We had never been. Breakfast is my fav meal of the day and I really like to get or make a seriously good one.  Wow, this one turned out to be great..  First, we had this great server... Thaynara... She was sweet, understanding, and smart! She has patience while we figured out what we wanted to eat, so many choices!  YOU HAVE TO SEND HER TO SEE MICKEY!!!!!!! Since we were 3, two of us decided to split the Works Veggie Benny... and Pumpkin Pancakes.. and the third party got the Chili Rellenos.  Everything was really good.. I always hesitate to get poached eggs since so many restaurants make them in advance and have them sitting in a water bath, so in the end either you get a medium to hard yolk or a watery mess.. these were perfect, the minute you cut into them the yolk spread everywhere, the spinach and avocado were raw not cooked to death and I just can't believe the potatoes.. They were spiced and hot and really good, and we had a  choice of potatoes or fruit and since we couldn't decided Thay suggested 1/2 and 1/2.. Perfect.  The pumpkin pancakes were moist (which I didn't expect, usually they are dry dry dry) but they were really good, like a good pumpkin cake (not pie)..  And the Rellenos were really good, not too much cheese (which I don't like) and he really enjoyed them. All in all a really good meal!  It's 3PM and I'm still not hungry.. Oh, and we tried the Banana Muffins.. we gobbled them up!  Even the coffee was OK..  Definitely, will be heading back for more!",

It was great.  Our food, however, was not. The server said our potatoes were fresh, but they didn't taste nor look fresh. They put wayyyy too much cheese on everything and it completely covered up the taste of everything else. So we decided to give it another try. Came back on a Saturday morning, had the banana nut muffin that tasted stale, again, way too much cheese and our food took forever! I don't know why I thought this place would use fresher ingredients... Definitely disappointing.",

Oh and they gave an extremely generous offering of french fries. yum yum!  *Fender Blender: Some type of egg and crepe contraction which was light fluffy and all around delicious. It came with an asian-inspired sauce which complimented the main course perfectly. Oh and the potatoes were spot-on!    *Florentine Omlette (Daily Special): Ironically the daily special was not special at all . Instead it was a complete epic fail in my party.

It was very good. In retrospect I would just get a skillet but I was starving and not thinking clearly with all the choices!   I went on a Saturday morning and even though it was crowded, it felt like the wait was fine. The staff is friendly and was obviously working very hard to be quick yet still friendly. I enjoyed this place.",

When we pulled in there was a line of people outside waiting. Despite the line we only waited 10-15 minutes to be seated. The menu was bigger than I thought. I had the chicken fried steak and eggs. I didn't take a picture of it normally because I was 3 or 4 bites deep before I realized I didn't take a picture. The portions were large and the food came out fast. The wifey said she loved the banana muffin. I didn't get it. I can't give an honest opinion about the muffin because I don't enjoy muffins. Back to the portions, they were so huge this chubby boy couldn't finish it. The potatoes were seasoned just right and not overly covered in seasoning. I am picky about my gravy and it compares well with my aunts gravy. This place is a no fluff breakfast joint. Highly recommended!",

The Banana Nut Muffin is so delish! They bring it out to you nice and warm! They also sell them in a loaf for $6.99 and I always buy a loaf home. And they wrap it in clear color papers that makes it look very nice and presentable. The Brad's Very Special is good. It comes with a side of potatoes and eggs that are scrambled together with spinach, mushroom, tomatoes, and cheese melt together.   I definitely recommend this place to anyone that visits Vegas.",

Egg works bennys are farrrrr more tastier and better than babystax. It has much better flavoring. The potatoes on the side is seasoned really well. Can even preach that their potatoes fries taste better than babystax potatoes fries. The price here is cheaper than babystax. The only downside is the pancakes. Their pancakes and banana nut muffin was not good at all.",

Oj was a must! Annnnd we got muffins for free for checking in! The orders were hugeeee and all the plates came with a side of home fries! My chicken fried skillet plate was amazing! Definitely not what I expected. The fried chicken was covered with gravy and then topped with two Sunnyside eggs. I thought the fried chicken would be too crunchy or crispy and wouldn't blend well with the home fries tucked underneath and especially for breakfast but I was worrying for now reason! The chicken was covered with the gravy making them soft and moist yet still a bit crispy! This plate is definitely a must try!!!! The pancakes were great, one order came with two large pancakes that were soft and moist! The omelette was awesome as well. The omelette was filled with tomatoes, mushrooms and spinach! If you're able to drive out from the strip stop by here for some bomb breakfast!",

This place is always packed though. They now take your name and text you when your table is ready though. Just be prepared for about a 15-25 min wait. It is very worth it though. I love the waffles. They don't need any syrup, because they are sweet on their own. I leave very satisfied everytime. We chose first available seating and had to sit outside today though. It was quite chilly. They need heaters in the winter/spring out there!",

He didn't even worry about asking how many because he had seen it was just the two of us. As we followed him to our seats he turned to make conversation with us asking how our day has been and was very nice and smiling the whole time! When we got to the table he pulled out my chair and then my boyfriends. His customer service was what I'd compare to fine dining service! Thank you so much Corey! Then we were sitting for less than a minute and our waitress Manuela was already over with two waters. She was very friendly when she greeted us and gave us the perfect amount of time to decide on our meal. We also were very interested In trying the banana nut muffin so she had that come out before our food! It was warm and soft! Definitely a must try. When our food came out Manuela came by to check on us and make sure everything was meeting our standards. I ordered the morning mountain breakfast and it was eggs, cheese, and ham over a croissant. My boyfriend ordered the biscuits and gravy which he was really pleased with! Everything was very good and Manuela was very attentive to us (even though it was obviously busy inside and out). She made sure our drinks were always full and we were doing good. I give it 5 stars not only for the service but the food as well. We will be back again!",

This place can do almost anything (and more) with eggs and their banana nut muffins are to die for. They warm it up for you and taste amazing with or without butter. Service is great! The staff is super friendly check in on you without hovering. There are so many delicious options on their menu and sadly I was only in LV for a few days but I would definitely go back just to eat here again!   Side note: I fell so in love with their muffins that I went back the day before my flight back home to get 3 to eat on the way back - AND THEY THREW IN A FOURTH MUFFIN FOR FREE!!",

I wasn't thoroughly impressed with this place, but let's be real, how yummy can anything healthy get? But I decided to give it another chance and decided to try one of their signature dishes. THE stuffed french toast: french toast stuffed with egg, sausage and cheese topped with powdered sugar. It's a heavenly mix of savory and sweet, especially dipped in maple syrup.  Most of their entrees come with their homemade potatoes. They're lightly fried to give a french fry crisp and cajun-flavored that makes it taste like Lay's BBQ chips!!  This place is better than the all time popular Hash House A-go-go!! It's as good as breakfast can get!!",

    "text": "Average greasy spoon that would make you not hungry, but not worth the trip from the strip.  Service: Excellent Food: Average to below average Price: Fair for what you get, but with added costs of having to uber it there and back, it isn't worth it.   Preliminary: We went on a Monday morning and there was no line and service was great. Other than that, the restaurant was lacking and not worth the trip from the strip. Just FYI, these Egg & I restaurants are independent from one another as I heard the staff tell another customer.  My wife and I went on a Monday morning. The reviews said their would be lines, but we encountered none.   We got a variety of food. She got coffee, pancakes, scrambled eggs, and turkey ham.  I got OJ, hot tea, biscuits and gravy, potatoes, and turkey sausage (they only have patties in turkey sausage).    She said her coffee was good, the eggs were as expected, but nothing spectacular, and she liked the turkey ham. The pancakes were not cooked all the way through. She ate about 1/3 before she got to the middle to discover the undercooking. The restaurant offered to toss them back on the griddle, but she declined as she wanted to eat my potatoes (which were very good).  They brought out a chocolate muffin to make up for it. It hasn't been eaten yet, but I suspect it's pretty decent.   As for my food, the potatoes were really good! Like really good.  Well seasoned and smaller and crispy, the way I prefer them to be. My wife liked them as well.  My turkey sausage was  undercooked and cold when served.  If you like hot tea like me, savor your first tea bag, because that's all you'll be getting for the $2.50 it costs to get hot tea. And perhaps it was my mistake for ordering biscuits and gravy; as a southern man, maybe my standards are too high. The meal was reminiscent of what you get at a Holiday Inn continental breakfast in the south. Seriously, no joke, and I feel bad about saying it like that, but it's True. The biscuits were hard and as if they were precooked and then microwaved when the dish was ordered. The gravy was ok, but nothing special.   Overall, with the cost of breakfast, plus the uber there and back, it would have been just as cheap to do the Bellagio buffet and gotten better food and more options.",

    "text": "Are you tired of waiting in lines that look like you're at Disney just to eat buffet food?  Then do I have an off the strip place that you'll will like.  My cousin told me about the Egg & I.  Boy am I glad that he did.  The food was really good.  There was a 10-15 minute wait but did not compare to those monstrous lines in the casino hotels.    After glancing through their newspaper styled menu, I decided to have a four egg omelette.  Which was more than delicious when it arrived.  Accompanying this wonderful omelette was their famous ranch potatoes.  These bad boys were orgasmic good.  They were seasoned with some spices that gave it a lil bit of a kick.  But if you aren't into spicy then I advise you put some ketchup on them to dull the fire.  All in all the meal was delicious.  The service was pretty good as well.  They have a system where there is a napkin holder and on top are two pictures of eggs.  If you need some assistance then you just flip the egg to yellow.  Now I may be butchering the explanation of this process but long story short the wait staff is very attentive and helpful.  So give it a shot if you are tired of long buffet lines.  It also gives you a chance to see the other parts of Vegas.",

I tried to order a mimosa which I was then told that even though it's on the menu they don't have them. Ashley took offense to that as well. It took a while to get our sodas, she never came back for refills. After a bit she came to take our order and didn't get that right either. My sister ordered a burger with a muffin as an appetizer,  the muffin never came. I ordered a pesto veggie sandwich (came out without pesto) but Ashley didn't know that because she never checked on our food once it cane out. My mom asked 3 people for mustard, by the time she got it her burger was cold. Overall less than happy with the experience. Cheers, hope yours is better than ours.",

So I got thought the extended diatribe on the phone clarifying and identify I understand the extra charges for a side of tomatoes, the cashier says 10 minutes. I get to the restaurant about 6 minutes later only to sit and wait another 20 or so, the price of which had never been disclosed to me. $11 per 4-egg omelet. I was a little shocked, but then my order was also wrong, they missed my extras and wanted to charge me even more for simple stuff like an ounce of tomatoes. I'm trying to grin and bare it, when the cashier dashes off without a word to get her manager, because she doesn't actually know the cost of said side of tomatoes. The manager comes out with a half -ass-ed apology and an offer to \"take care of me\" the NEXT time I choose to suffer through this establishment's shotty service. So now that I've arrived at my office a whole 3 minute drive away, My fruit cup was leaking all over the bag of food. Each meal was luke warm, the ranch potatoes nearly broke a tong of my plastic fork, which we received one less than requested. My crazy chicken  omelet, which is described as \"Loaded with julienned chicken breast, fresh mushrooms and guacamole. Topped with muenster cheese and sour cream.\" on the website, had flavorless dark meat chicken, and mushy old guacamole that was terrible. Don't trouble yourself with this establishment, food should be a delight, not a stressful experience.",

I forget which one I usually order, I think it's called the \"Collision\" or something?  It has mushrooms and bacon in it.  The Ranch Potatoes are like like Potato Chips, you can't help but pop one after the other, after the other, in your mouth.  But, it's not like I can finish it anyways, because of that damn freakin most delicious Banana Nut Muffin I have in the beginning.  Oh my gosh, slap a little butter on it, hell, slap a lot of butter on that warm muffin and it's freakin heaven.  I'll need to ask the next time I'm around if I can actually order some muffins to go.

My hubby and brother in law always get either the Mexican Omelette or the Francisco's Scramble. We love this place. It gets very busy during peak hours  so get there before 9am. But, it's a pretty big place and it has a huge patio. So, we never have a long wait. If you want a great breakfast head over here. This is also our favorite location.

With all the hype we found ourselves disappointed. You can tell Yelp has made this a popular choice, but we thought it was just mediocre. The only thing I can rave about is the banana bread French toast... bomb! The first time my meal came out the French toast was barely warm. I let our server, CeCe, know and asked her if it was possible to warm it up. Instead she offered to bring out a whole other fresh order. CeCe was absolutely great. I would give her 5 stars, but not the whole establishment. The pictures of the outside of the restaurant almost swayed me from going but decided to give it a shot. There are so many other restaurants in Vegas that have a nice ambience or view, but their food sucks. We decided we would rather have great food in a lesser desirable atmosphere, but didn't get that after all. Maybe it was an off morning for them, though we did go on a Monday morning at 9:30 and the place wasn't too packed. I would hate to see how they perform on a Sunday morning if this is how it is on a weekday morning.  I would give them another chance only for that banana bread French toast. Without it I would give them a 2 stars at most.",

They did a slight boo boo on my omelette but Carolina went and told her manager and in return they gave me a free banana loaf and carrot cake loaf  I would take that anytime. I would definitely come back here when traveling out this way and I would definitely recommend this place to everyone!!",

IMHO, nothing special. Got an egg white veggie omelet.  Pretty plain, though I saved it with ketchup!  Was going to get the stuffed  French Toast, but I love a good omelet.  Just okay here.  Home-style potatoes were good, though they tasted like they had been sitting in the warmer instead of freshly made. Not really large portions.  I did enjoy the banana nut muffin and got one to go.  A friend had huevos rancheros and he really liked it.  Would I go back?  I doubt it.  Too many places in Vegas that have better service and better food.  Maybe the lunch is better. Maybe if I were a meat eater.  Maybe it was just a bad day.  Oh well.  But for me, if you want a place that has better ambience, HUGE portions and a menu that is like a book, go to Hash Hash A Go-Go.",

I guess after seeing the 4 stars, made my eggspection higher. For the price I could just get any whole loaf of ordinary banana bread. It came out greasy and you just can't enjoy and finish the whole plate.  My friend ordered the pancakes and we agreed that it was the worst pancake we have ever tasted.  Well, it;s an egg place but considering it being a breakfast place, we eggspect better.  I look around and see people not finishing their plate, no wonder why.

My spouse has the collision which was a cross between a crepe and an omelette. We both ordered potatoes with our entre and a banana muffin. I had seen the muffin delivered to another table. The omelette was awesome the green chile had so much flavor. The collision my spouse had was very good. The banana muffin was the best banana bread or muffin I have ever had. I would go back just for the muffin. Carol Anne was a great server and kept checking with us and took care of us through the whole meal. I noticed on her name tag she had worked there for 4 years and it showed. She knew everything about the restaurant. I would highly recommend this place for breakfast or lunch.

The crepe was a party of flavor, and the good salsa on the side was a surprising accompaniment for a breakfast place  Though the real star was the people.

Our waitress was very friendly and attentive. When we told her that it was our first time at Egg & I, she said that all newcomers get a banana nut muffin on the house (even without a Yelp Check-in). The muffins were delicious - sweet and moist. The menu was pretty long and had a lot of options. We decided to try the Bacon and Sliced Avocado Omelette, which was good. It came with a side of potatoes, which had a crispy exterior. Though a bit salty, they were really tasty. We also enjoyed the Traditional Benny, which was an English muffin topped with Canadian Bacon and poached eggs. I liked the hollandaise sauce it came with. The portion sizes were good - we were able to split one dish for two people.  Will come back if I'm in the area again!",

It was so bad our waiter had comped our food. So needless to say, we were hesitant coming back here because had to catch our flight. We were pleasantly surprised to come and get seated right away. It was not very crowded and the service was quick!  Breakfast Burrito - This was pretty big and smothered with sauce. I personally do not like my burritos to have sauce on the outside soaking into the tortilla. The ingredients inside were not too bad though.   Oatmeal - I went super plain Jane because we had eaten really late the night before and I wasn't into something heavy. You can't really mess up oatmeal so this was fine.   Overall, it was a quick breakfast and the service was good.",

I watched it congeal before my second bite, at which point the flavor was so overwhelmingly bad that I had to stop.  I guess if all you want is scrambled eggs and coffee you'll be okay, but don't waste your time here. Even a Denny's or IHOP would be a better place to eat.  4.5 stars here. I just don't know.

    "text": "If you're of the mentality that the best food in Las Vegas only lives on the strip, you're going to miss a healthy dose of delicious, inexpensive food. The Egg & I is largely an antithesis to what \"Vegas\" stands for. It is low key, low on panache, and reasonably priced.  I've been here now a couple of times, all in the winter and early spring months, which means I'm always on the patio, because for me 70 + degrees is perfect patio weather. The inside does seem a little bit packed for my taste, regardless of what time they're open. On the weekends, you'd be hard pressed to find a time when it's not poppin here. But that's okay, I assure you it's worth the wait.  The menu is expansive. I'm talking, there is something for everyone. Hashes, Omelettes, Scrambles, Sweets, Benedict, even some rogue brunch items which are surprisingly good in their own right. But by and large, breakfast here is the way to go. Anything with their namesake, eggs, is an automatic winner. Portions are on the larger side, but not obscenely so. You're going to walk away full, but not sickly so, which is the perfect storm breakfast in my eyes. If you're a coffee fan like myself, it flows freely here and is pretty damn good. Overall, I really like this place and would recommend it for locals and tourists alike.  Other benefits include: parking situation is easy to navigate, food itself is reasonably priced.   *Takes all major credit cards, except American Express.",

Their food is generous in proportions & they offer \"healthier\" ways to have your meal prepared (like using cooking spray vs oil or substituting egg wholes for egg whites only).   All the times I've come here, the service here is great and the wait is never too long! When I came, I was worried that we were going to wait for a while because there were many people waiting but we got seated within 20 minutes.   I ordered a ham, cheese, avocado, spinach, & mushroom omelette with potatoes and a banana nut muffin. I love that they have Cholula as an option for hot sauce haha!   Tamara, my server, was great! I definitely recommend eating here for breakfast!   PS. When seated outside, if it is a hot day, they have the mist going outside so sitting outside did not feel uncomfortable or annoying at all.   Don't forget to check-in to get your free banana nut muffin!",

It gets pretty packed here all the time but it's definitely worth the wait if you are waiting awhile. The variety of different breakfast, brunch & lunch options are all amazing. I love getting the biscuits and gravy as a meal. They offer great health substitutes like turkey options versus your standard pork sausages. The turkey ham is delicious! I love it because it's not too salty. We tried the chicken fried steak & the chili relleno omelette before and it was delicious! They come with a generous amount of their amazing potatoes. If you order coffee, they leave a full pitcher of it for you on the table to refill when you need it. I definitely need to try other things on the menu and explore my taste buds.

A friend who resided in Sin City decided to take me and my girlfriends here after a long night & morning of partying/clubbing/gambling. I told him I want a place with bomb breakfast & local flavor. Egg & I delivered just that!   I had a slight hangover and the hustle & bustle of the busy atmosphere did not aid in it going away. However, I was cured after I had some OJ, Egg Crepe & superr delicious potatoes! I do not know what type of seasoning is doused over those cut up potatoes they servve but it sure did hit the spot! I even joked with our waitress asking if they sell the seasoning (which unfortunately, they don't). The portions are pretty huge so if you don't eat a whole lot like myself, think of sharing with a friend.  I couldn't let my food go to waste so I got a to-go box which definitely came in handy during the road trip back to Long Beach.",

    "text": "Thank you Yelp!  We were looking for a place to have a good breakfast before heading out on the road back to Phoenix.  We had been in Vegas for four nights and were looking for something other than the options around our hotel.  I found the Egg & I using my awesome Yelp iPhone app.  Everyone agreed to give it a shot and we were all singing praises to both Egg & I and to Yelp at the end of the meal.  The special of the day was the Prime Rib Skillet, Prime Rib over breakfast potatoes, cheese, and eggs any way you want em.  Two people at our table of six went for the special.  Other meals included a Brad's Scramble, two Chicken Fried Steak Skillets, and mine was the Kay's Omelette (Four egg spinach omelette stuffed with a blend of artichoke hearts, swiss cheese, parmesan, garlic and cream cheese. Topped with fresh tomatoes and feta cheese.)  Everyone was raving about their breakfast, except for one.  One friend does not like mushrooms and did not realize they were in her skillet.  She started to pick them out and when the waitress same to check on us, she noticed the pile of mushrooms and offered to have them remake the dish.  Very nice customer service.  My friend didn't want to wait, so she declined, but it was still very nice of the server to notice and offer a new dish.  The standout of the meal was the breakfast potatoes with their special seasoning.  These are the best breakfast potatoes that I have ever had, and I love breakfast potatoes!  The seasoning had a really good flavor and the potatoes were in the perfect bite-sized chunks.  There are plenty of great reviews for this place, so I don't need to go on and on.  Just one more final thought.  When I am coming home from a trip I always like to look back and think about what I learned during the trip.  On this trip, I learned a few things . . .  1 - Don't hold your new cell phone over a pint of Guinness, chances are it may fall in. 2 - Cash out at roulette once you have doubled your original bet.  Even if you just walk right back and put down the original bet again. 3 - Add the Egg & I to the \"must-have\" list anytime I'm in Vegas!",

Fried potatoes that come with many entrees are mediocre. Biscuits and Gravy are good. Mashed potato omelette is exactly what it sounds like. Ironically, I was expecting something different or creative. It was okay. Pancakes were really good. Service was great! Establishment is not that bad, but a little ronchy due to all the green...just weird.",

There are so many great sounding items on the menu deciding what to get can be difficult, but the good news is, you really can't go wrong with anything you choose. The wait staff is always really nice and accomodating. I almost always order the same thing the bacon, cheddar and avocado omlette with egg whites and sour cream.  I was introduced to these breakfast spots my aunt who lived in Vegas for over 20 years and for the most part the customers are all locals so if you're in town and wanna get away from the tourists, check out these breakfast spots.",

I guess b/c I had such a great experience with EGG WORKS their sister place I had put this place on such a high pedestal and they fell off... and no all the kings horses and all the kings men couldnt put this bk together again.   ENTREE: my bf got the franciscan scramble. sounded really good and he's a professional order-er. Its amazing to watch him work. Everything he orders always comes out spectacular and the best tasting dish at the table. not me.  I had a the tostada last time and I had really wanted the cobb salad but was torn. So this time cobb salad was my only request.  disguisting.   COBB: I love cobb salads. This was just plain GROSS. they probably gave me 3-4 lbs of ICEBURG LETTUCE. really? iceburg? gross.  the croutons were the 99 cent croutons with the green specks on it. They gave me 1/4 of an egg... at a a place with the word EGG in it.. i was very disappointed. You'd think theyere 'd be at least a full egg? maybe 2. no. on top of my salad was a lil bit of shredded cheese, and some deli sliced sandwich meat turkey and ham (not even cubes) and the box of sprouts sittong on top of my salad. i ordered blue cheese dressing, they brought me ranch. anything that could go wrong did. 2nd worst meal i've had in las vegas since I've lived here.   Maybe its my fault? my fault for ordering anything that wasnt scrambled so early in the morning. I take some responsibility in that I guess. my bf's omelet was delicious. the potatoes were good.. so was his banana nut muffin.. (while my bran muffin was gross) it was just the perfect yin/yang of good vs. evil... , er mavs vs the heat, the cowboys vs the 49ers, egg works vs egg & I... and yes good food vs. bad food.   The only reason I gave them 2stars was b/c of the bfs food was 4 stars cancelled out by my zero stars.. to equal 2. :)  Here's hoping you gleam something from my review... please do not order a salad at egg & I.",

Went once with my wife and I and sat outside and enjoyed one of their excellent scrambles and a delicious benedict, both of which we really enjoyed.    The second visit was this past weekend with my parents and brother and sister in law.  Food and service were both fantastic.  I had the chicken and chorizo breakfast burrito, while others enjoyed the cordon bleu skillet, a chorizo skillet, a french dip sandwich with cajun fries and an eggs benedict.  Everyone thoroughly enjoyed their food, which was brought very quickly given how packed the place was - talk about an efficient kitchen.  Our cups (water and coffee) never ran dry and the waiter struck the perfect balance between leaving us be to enjoy our meals and making sure we got what we need.

I am use to eating corned beef out of a can where the meat is more like ground beef compared to this place where the meat is shredded, and oh man that was awesome. So as you can read, I ordered the corned beef hash which does come with 2 eggs made whatever way you'd like, some pretty good, crispy, special seasoned cut potatoes, and a choice of a banana nut muffin or toast of choice. The waitress was nice enough to pass out free muffins for everyone, the muffin sounded good and everyone at other tables had them, but in actuallity it was only ok. I probably should have went for the toast, but looking at my friend's toast, I will say that they put a lot of butter on it, so if you don't want that shit, make sure to tell them, because I don't think they'll tell you. Oh also forgot to mention that the order also comes with two random slices of fruit.  I actually felt a tad overwhelmed, not by the meat, but the potatoes, while great, it was just so much starch to digest, but non the less, it was still satisfactory and the flavorings in each bite were awesome.   Service was awesome but paying at the end seemed to drag because we had to wait in line to pay at the register....but regardless, I would definitely go here for breakfast if I ever wake up in time during my Vegas trips.",

My only compliant is the gravy was a tad bit too salty for my tastebuds, and I love salty. ...other than that it was perfect. It was already buttered to perfection!  Attention to detail.

We came here on a whim and now it's on my list of must go to spots in Vegas. It's your typical breakfast joint... no more than a 20 min wait even when the  masses are outside the front entrance. There's a plethora of breakfast dishes... american style, mexican style and even islander style! Oh yes... LOCO MOCO. I know Aloha Kitchen is just right there... but when hubs wants Hawaiian and I want Mexican... well then, you gotta find some way to compromise. Egg & I did not fall short with their Loco Moco... it definitely hit the spot... and so did that side of spam!",

The CFS is excellent and rivals some of the places I go to.  Our waitress, Reina, is very friendly and took care of us. She even apologized to my friend about the football game loss last night. This shows she likes to interact with the customers. She also was attentive and came by to ask how things were or if we needed anything. The service in general is excellent as we always had a rotating staff to help with clearing the table.   I'll definitely be coming back to try other dishes.",

I had their breakfast sundae which is basically some yogurt with granola and fruit and it was just fine.

It's a really good family and brunch place.    I ordered an omelette and enjoyed it a lot.  The portions are generous here.  The best part of this place is the service.  Our server (older Hispanic lady) was very funny and recommended different things for us.  I was being picky and she let me.  Thanks, ma'am!  The roasted potatoes here are really good.  I like hashed browns a lot and never really like home potatoes, but for once the potatoes trumped the hashed browns.  They were crispy and lightly seasoned.  I tried the chocolate chip pumpkin pancakes and the tasted absolutely AMAZING!  I couldn't stop eating them even though I was full.  I also had a bite of someone's French toast sandwich, and oh my gosh, did that taste like heaven in my mouth!!!!!  If you're ok with a heart attack on a plate, this is it.  It was a huge portion of eggs, bacon, ham, and sausage goodness.  This was probably the tastiest thing on the menu, and I had only a bite.  Definitely something you can share if you're not too hungry.  Great service and good value for the dollar!  Egg & I, I will be back!",

I was visiting Vegas with family and actually craving pancakes, but I couldn't eat at a place called \"The Egg & I\" and not have eggs.  So I ordered a simple breakfast the Eggs Plus (over easy eggs, grits, toast, and bacon).  I had never seen such a perfectly cooked over easy egg, and it definitely tasted that way.  The white of the egg was so airy!  My mom was willing to share a bite of her eggs benedit, and they were soooo good!  I felt I had to commemorate the visit, so I bought my mom an \"Egg & I\" coffee mug.  :)  Oh, and the staff was very friendly.",

I felt that I got overdosed with the salt after I've finished only one third of the chicken fried steak. I had my egg scrambled, and the egg didn't taste good, seems like they put white pepper in it and I don't like white pepper. So I was done with the egg with only one bite.  My husband said the egg crepe was interesting enough that he liked it, while it was also too heavy for him as it's made with 4 eggs.  The meal was okay, could be better though. We can get better chicken fried steak (with the right saltiness) at the other diner in town, so probably won't order chicken fried steak ever again at Egg & I.   I think the best item of the meal was the banana nut muffin, which was only a side that came with the entree.  Our server was very nice though.  We don't know if we would come back again........just because we are not attracted to other menu items so much while we know we are not gonna order chicken fried steak here again.",

I've never had homefries that were so crispy before....they probably deep fry them.  But deep fried anything is great usually.    Service is great too.

Got hooked up on banana nut muffins with the check in. Deliciously moist and flavorful.   So when deciding to order my buddy and i couldnt decide between the chile relleno omlete and the a south west type of omlete.. so we decided to order both and split it. Ya i know l, totally adorable.  Must say the chile relleno is soooooo good. Definitely filling and hit all the right marks. Not many places can make a good chile relleno entre, alertos is the only place in oc, imo, but eggs and i got it right.  The south west type was also a good omlete. Definitely tasted the different components but it was not as awe strucking as the chile relleno omlete.  Other things ordered at the table was a \"1/2\" order of maple bacon french toast had a special type of syrup as well. This plate was a good addition to the overall meal.   The gf ordered a carrot cake french toast. She said it was ok in comparison to the chile relleno omlete *cough cough*. But i need to be hoenst besides loving chile rellenos.. i love carrot cake! It was moist, similar texture as the banan nut muffin and with bits of carrots enough for texture. Definitely a fan.   Besides great service with the food, out waitress was just as diligent with our questions in regards to this establishment's history.  Will be back next vegas trip and ill recommend it to everyone i talk to.",

I think it's probably a service size for at least two people.  Bottom line, check this place out. It's off the strip and two peoples breakfast with a pitcher of orange juice was under $30.

Oh, and the potatoes that came with it was nicely season and tasted fresh unlike some breakfast places, potatoes are soggy and no flavor. I would definitely go back whenever I'm in vegas.

I've been here many times growing up in Las Vegas, and about the only thing in Las Vegas that has stayed the same is: Egg & I.   It's just so consistent. You know what you're going to get and you know it's going to be good. Change is good, but in this case changing the already good thing they have going on would be a terrible idea.   The ONLY downside is the sometimes insane wait times for a table. But hey, we can't punish a restaurant too much for its own success can we?   I've had the eggs Benedict and the eggs here so much growing up I subconsciously judge every egg I have anywhere in the world based on the Egg & I's standard.   Give it a go!

From the outside, this place wasn't incredibly impressive but it was clean and well located. We only waited about 10 minutes, and when we were seated I was excited to see the menu was quite diverse. I went for a traditional bacon & cheese omelet with toast & potatoes and I was quite pleased. I am a total breakfast enthusiast and I believe anyone can cook breakfast, but not anyone can do it well. I will keep this place in mind for future Vegas trips.",

The gravy on the country fried steak was sooo good it makes you wanna slap your grandma...The banana pancakes were sweet, fluffy and delish, the omelette was pure deliciousness , ham, bacon, sausage, bell peppers, onions and tomato with lots of cheese in between and on the outside of the omelette, the sour cream added more bang to the already incredible omelette. Didnt try their famous stuffed french toast, but I am sure that whatever you order here will be so delicious. The potatoes on the side are meh, nothing to write home and tell your mother about...the coffee wasn't strong either, it was more on the watery side. The service was attentive, however, mid way through our meal the server left the check on the table. This is something my boyfriend and i always hate. Like bih!! You see all this food in front of me, fork in my mouth, does it look like im ready for the check!???!!!I get it you are packed up the a$$ but damn lemme get through at least 3/4 of my meal, before you come and make me feel rushed to leave!  Give this place a try, get off the strip and be a little adventurous. Don't be afraid of the crowds outside, we were seated within 25-30 mins of checking in. Make sure you check-in to get that delicious banana nut muffin pure deliciousness!",

Spinach, mushroom and artichoke make this omelette absolutely delicious, even for the carnivores out there.  Decor: The restaurant itself is located near a strip mall. The interior seems kind of dated, but it's a trivial concern as the food more than makes up for that.  Service: Alyssa was our server, and she was very professional and attentive. Our food came out in a timely manner, and right the first time. My water cup was never empty and my girlfriend's coffee was never low. Great service.",

When I tried to eat it, it was so tough that a knife couldn't even cut through it. I asked for another one and asked that it not be heated in a microwave. They claimed it wasn't. I don't understand how it was steaming hot and so tough and hard around the edges. Then, when I got their potato scramble, the cheese all over the top was hard and not the soft, melted type of cheese. So if you ate your potatoes, you could pick up a whole layer of cheese. Again, it was overcooked. It's too bad because the flavors were there in both the potatoes and the muffin. The biscuits and gravy were good.",

First off, their menu is huge but I suggest looking through the whole thing, especially if you can't decide on breakfast or lunch food. They have a huge variety of options including meat lovers and vegetarians. I also love how they have gluten free options for toast, waffles, pancakes, and French toast! It's an extra $2 charge but so worth it. If you don't have a severe allergy, you can turn any of the regular waffles or pancakes into GF (some of them have vanilla which contains a small amount). I ordered the bacon maple creme French toast and it was delectable. Also got the bacon & onion skillet which was amazing! Potatoes were cooked perfectly and everything combined tasted great. It was a little too salty for my liking but not even complaining. When I come back to Vegas I'll come back here for sure.",

    "text": "Edit [12/29]   I don't usually edit reviews, but I will make an exception in this case. After our original review, Caitlin the manager reached out directly and offered to compensate us should we try his resturant a second time. We were not able to take him up on his offer as we were heading out of town. That being said, it meant a lot that he recognized the issue and took steps to address it.  [Original post]  Unfortunately, we can't post a review based on the actual food. We were staying in Vegas for a couple of days and wanted to get away from the Strip for breakfast. Reviews for this place were great, so we thought why not.   We showed up, it was crowded and we thought that was a good sign. Asked the lady working up front how long the wait might be. She gave us an ugly, why are you bothering me look. Not sure what her deal was. She told us, \"at least 35 min, got it?\" I remarked to my wife that she wasn't the most friendly person we had met. After which, the lady's attitude became downright aggressive.   I get it that she was busy, that's a good thing. We were very polite and friendly until she came at us with a \"fu\" attitude. Hope the owners realize that one negative employee can kill the deal quick.",

This restaurant had both inside and outside seating, those who had outside seating had water mists to help keep cool during the heat. I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom and Spinach skillet. Its layered with cubed potatoes, next is chicken, then mushrooms followed by spinach, they melted Jack and cheddar cheese ontop and you got to pick how you like your two eggs which topped off the layers and your choice of toast or their banana nut bread. To drink we had a Michelada which was delicious as well. I would 10000% recommend this establishment to anyone who plans on visiting Vegas, totally worth the visit!",

The best part about this restaurant that you won't find anywhere else (usually) they have indicators on their tables that you can show if you need some service (a happy egg/or a sad egg) and their very prompt on service in that regard.  The food was good! Run of the mill spam and eggs for me-can't go wrong here! The eggs were perfect and the spam was on point with a little  on the side of pineapple!

You can opt out for egg whites instead, add veggies to anything. It was just refreshing to have those options on paper, I usually feel annoying when i ask for all those changes on my food.

The omelet is so large, my wife and I always split it and still have a hard time finishing. The muffins and potatoes accompanying the omelet are also really good. CAUTION/HAZARD/WARNING: When ordering the chili for your omelet, do not order the Cincy Chili unless you really like cinnamon. We made this mistake once and were spewing cinnamon from our ears for days. Don't get me wrong, I like cinnamon... in moderation... on buns... in apple pie... on desserts... in eggnog... but please, not in my eggs!  Another note: We have stopped at a few Egg & I's in other cities and they do not offer the Banana Nut Muffins and the Chili Omelets.",

My GF got the stuffed French toast which was good as well. Each dish was very generous. One order could easily be split between 2 people.   We were told afterwards that you could order half size portions for each order. Would've been nice to know that in the beginning.   Overall, staff and food quality was great. Other nice thing I liked was that you could pay the check at your table. They had a tablet payment machine on your table. So you can pay via credit card, apple pay, Samsung pay, or android pay.

Lets define it as two eggs (fried or poached), sliced bacon or sausages, sliced bread or toast with jam/jelly/butter, pancakes with syrup, cornflakes or other cereal, coffee/tea, orange/grapefruit juice. With that in mind if American Breakfast is what you desire, Egg & I can serve you one mean tummy fillin' meal.  When I was there I ordered a Bacon & Slices Avocado Omelette and some coffee to wash it down. The omelette was delicious, coffee was good, but I would have preferred a more traditional home fries.   I sat outside and my server who was a young lady was very good at her job. I got good food, great service and walked out happier and most likely heavier than when I walked in!",

    "text": "This was a very impressive breakfast restaurant!  I came here with 4 of my other friends while we were in Vegas and all of us had a positive experience.  Both the food and the service were \"egg-cellent.\"    Anyhow, I try to be a little bit pun-ny at times and this is one of them.  First off, the SERVICE was great.  We came in around noon time and the restaurant was mostly crowded but our group of 5 was seated as soon as we walked in the door.  We were greeted by the hostess with a big smile and much enthusiasm.  What's interesting is that their menu is in the form of a newspaper, which is very creative and something I've never seen before.  Our waitress, Amanda, was very energetic and did a wonderful job.  She was very helpful with her recommendations, very quick, and very genuinely friendly.  I love it when the people at a restaurant enjoy what they do.    As for the FOOD, my friends and I ordered different dishes but everyone enjoyed their meal.  I ordered a hawaiian dish that came with rice, eggs, and spam.  You could also have your choice of sausage.  Now, I know it sounds plain from the description but it was probably the best breakfast of those items I\"ve ever had.  Everything was prepared perfectly and also presented well.  I had two eggs that were made over-well, hot and juicy sausage that was perfectly seasoned and two mounds of perfectly scooped rice.  Also, before our dishes were served, we were given complimentary appetizers in the form of a banana nut muffin.  It was the best banana nut muffin I've ever tasted because it came out warm and seemed to be freshly made.  My other friends ordered the country fried chicken breast skillet as well as a turkey sandwich that they happily shared with me.  I got to try it and it was just as excellent tasting as my dish.  The portion sizes were generous and all of us were stuffed by the end of the meal.  What I found interesting was that they had a little sign in the shape of an egg that had two sides.  It was used to signal our waitress if we were in need of some help.  One side of the sign had a smiling egg and another had an egg with a sad face.  Apparently you are supposed to flip it to the sad facing egg side if you needed service.  Anyhow, the last part might not make sense until you actually go there...but it beats any breakfast place on the strip that I've been too!  Lastly, the PRICE is extremely affordable.  An entire meal for one person was about $9-$10 before tax and tip.  I sort of wish they had one in Orange County but I'll definitely come back here with friends the next time I visit vegas.",

First off, the location is really crappy looking.It almost made me want to find something near the hotel we were staying at. Second,  the food is not that great. It's just big slabs of cheese basically on the omelettes, and there was no flavor. Where's the flavor?! I had a bacon and avocado omelete. It had little bacon bits cooked into the egg, and it was hardly noticeable. The avocado was in a big chunk in the middle. Then it was covered in cheese and had some sour cream on top. Maybe strips of bacon would be better. Then maybe it could be tasted.  the potatoes are way too salty and taste weird. they definitely seemed like they were frozen. My husband was not impressed with his omelete neither.   With all the reviews we thought this place would be better. The atmosphere was drab, and the attitudes of the workers was somethin else. Even the manager seemed real fake.",

From start to finish the service and atmosphere were five star non pretentious par excellent or as they might say Eggs Cellent.   Our sever Lacey made excellent recommended dishes and her personal favorite. We shared two plates to get the best foodie experience we could in one trip. . Breakdown. The Mexican omelette was awesome. Plenty of distinct flavors and great size plate. Cheesy and little bit of a bite of spice  We had the home potatoes which were made to perfection with hot insides and crispy outside. This was accomplished by making the potatoes very small bites almost hash size.they offered all the condiments at our table with great hot sauces. The second dish wasn't my favorite but my friend loved which was the Stuffed French toast. All the ingredients we're good and the French toast itself was very good but for me it was too much in each Bite the flavors just were not distinct enough for me. We choose the fruit substitute on this plate and was surprised how much fresh fruit they gave on one plate.  Now the best part of this place. Reviews plenty. Write ups plenty as well. But.  The best part aside from the food was the people. Lacey was phenomenal came by like 10 times. Lino the other service person at our table was the best came by and verified with us like 10 times as well and that wasn't where it stopped. The other support staff also asked us a few times if we needed anything.  Hard to find that kind of service anywhere and they all did it with a smile.   Side note.  Coffee was left in carafe at table so no need to waive anyone down though you probably wouldn't need to with the service as good as it was here.  Last I highly recommend this place. The price was too good to be True for this food and service combo. Thanks Lacey and Lino and the whole staff there at Egg and I.

Food serve hot and they are very home-made.  Portion is good and they are not too greasy for my taste.  Their menu is printed on a newspaper, very creative and interesting.",

Being on a low carb diet, I opted out of the banana muffin and potatoes, but they both looked delicious. The wait for brunch was about 20 minutes for peak Saturday time, but so worth it. Our server, Liza was very personable and prompt with service. We got our meals hot, fresh and quick with the epitomy of service with a smile. Well off the strip so our meal for four of us was $55, which was what my husband I spent yesterday,  splitting a breakfast omelette yesterday at a breakfast spot on the strip.",

I mean, I was offered free breakfast at Wicked on my last day there and yet I decline because I MUST go here. The wait at time is long especially on the weekend but if you are willing to be seated in the patio, the wait time is cut in half. I couldn't have ask for a better service from all their staff.  Food: Waffle, Scramble Eggs, Omelets, Work Potato, etc etc etc You just can't go wrong with whatever you pick. Well, you might but I haven't. No matter what you order, make sure you try their work potato, it's like country potato but crunchier with more flavor.   Overall: Hate their parking lot, at times we have to park at the end of the plaza and walk over but it is so worth it.",

The banana nut muffin came with the meal and it was the best banana nut muffin I've ever had. It actually may be the best any muffin I've ever had. The staff was friendly with prompt/quick service with reasonable prices. The potatoes that come with most breakfast entrees were really good as well.",

A home town feel for breakfast to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Strip. The menu was on a newspaper style paper which was neat.   First the Banana Muffin came out and was moist and great!. I would want that muffin at the casino buffets. Then the food came out and it was huge. The potatoes were seasoned with some sort of lawry's seasoning flavor, pretty good, didn't need much ketchup, i didn't use any. The crepe was huge, it too up half teh dish, but was more like an omlet than a crepe. Still tasty and filling.   I like breakfast and I usually get a chicken fried steak for breakfast, but that crepe was definitely a head turner walking in to our seats... I'm sold on Eggs and I.",

    "text": "If you want some pretty awesome breakfast food with great portions and a friendly staff, then this spot is just for you.  I ordered the Prime Rib Benny and was more than satisfied at how generous the portion was along with how delicious it tasted!  Now I know a Prime Rib Benny isn't something that sounds all too familiar to anyone who hasn't been to this restaurant, so picture this:  juicy and flavorful pieces of blackened prime rib chopped up with poached eggs crowning an open faced buttery croissant, which is then drizzled with a rich and creamy hollandaise sauce.  It's like what traditional egg benedicts dream to be some day basically.  Regular eggs benedict is Carlton Banks, Prime Rib Benny is Will Smith.  You get the picture.  Besides the entree itself, my order of OJ was fresh squeezed and just right.  Their lemonade was great too, which is a definite plus in my book.  I also had a taste of their French fries and Portuguese sausage, which my cousins ordered and both were very tasty, too!  The fries were thin, crispy and flavorful.  While the Portuguese sausage was not overly oily and fatty and was cooked just right.  Service was verygood, as our waiter was attentive, friendly and always available.  They have this nifty little feature on your table where there's a sign of a sad face and on the other side of it, a sign of a happy face.  When you want your server's attention, you just flip the sign to show the sad face and you'll be helped right away.  I found this to be a very memorable and smart way of the restaurant going the extra mile to offer as much quality service to its patrons.",

    "text": "My sister and I had been pretty excited about coming here after reading all about it on Yelp.  It seemed to be really busy with lots of people waiting outside (on a Sunday afternoon), but we luckily only had to wait about 10 minutes before we were seated.    Our server was super nice.  She really helped elevate the entire experience.  When we asked for banana nut muffins to go with our entrees, she asked if it was our first time there.  We told her yes and she said the muffins were free for first timers!  Hope that's True and I'm not getting anyone in trouble by posting that info here.    I ordered the Eggs Benedict Florentine & it came with those little (obviously frozen) and highly seasoned potatoes.  Overall I enjoyed the dish, but there was so much Hollandaise sauce that the English muffin got pretty soggy and the ham was really quite bad.  It was cut in thick slices and was very rubbery.  It almost tasted canned or something.  I took the ham off and it was much better that way.  However, the whole thing was a runny, saucy mess.  The poached eggs were cooked perfectly though.  My sister unfortunately didn't enjoy her blueberry pancakes too much.  This might sound strange, but they were way too fluffy for both of us & just didn't taste that great.  We both loved the muffins though.  That very well may have been the best part of the whole meal.    Despite the rubbery ham, I'd definitely come back.  The service was excellent and I feel confident that we'll both be able to find other dishes on the menu that suit us better.  Plus.... those banana nut muffins!  You'd be a fool not to try one.",

I had the Taco Rancheros which was a flour torilla covered with scrambled eggs, seasoned ground beef, refried beans, cheese, sour cream and salsa. I put the fried potatoes on top of it and it was awesome!  My boyfriend had the Reuben Sandwich and he loved it.

We ordered the Chicken Fried Steak, Eggs Benedict Florentine, Ultimate Skillet, French Toast and of course the Banana Nut Muffin. The portions were huge and the food was tasty.

We asked the waitress for our toast she said your order doesn't come with toast we said we ordered toast she then looked all around our table and looked at us like we were hiding the toast in order to get free toast. She said I will go look for it . When it arrived it was at the end of our meal . The house potatoes are heavily seasoned with what I guess is season salt way to salty to enjoy . The carnitas were cold . It wasn't very good over all.",

They even have a little black egg you leave out when you don't need anything & you flip it to yellow so the waiters know when you need anything! I think that's a great concept & they should start something like that at all the restaraunts, ever. But anyhoo. I had 'the works.' 2 eggs, their country potatoes(they have a specific name, but it's escaping me right now), your choice of meat and toast. I opted for scrambled with cheese(my go-to), ham steak & cinnamon raisin toast. Everything was perfect! Wonderful after a long night of Vegas drinking. The prices are so affordable too. I will definitely be back, this place is great.",

They keep the bottomless coffee cup tradition going. To top it off, their eggs are all perfectly cooked! I got the hashbrown skillet, and it was fantastic. The potatoes were a little dry, but they had a nice seasoning. The prices are very reasonable, and the portion sizes are a bit on the large size.",

Fiesta skillet was perfect, great flavors, not too spicy w a lot of cheese, green chiles, & perfectly cooked eggs. All those raving about the banana walnut muffin were right, it is delicious, dark brown (molasses added?), moist and perfectly cooked. Almost glad my wife is allergic to walnuts so I could eat it all! Very large portions, we ate a little more than 1/2 of each of our meals & were more than full.  Way better than the casinos & a lot better value. Enjoy!!",

Unfortunately i wasn't very impressed.  There were a ton of people (as i expected) and my son and i only had to wait about 5 min., the entrance is horrible.  Seems like such a fire hazard to me....way to many people in and out and standing in the door way.    The seating was way too cramped for me.  But the waiter was right there and got our drinks right away.  Our food was brought out in great time.    Iam on a very strict diet, so i ordered whole wheat banana pancakes.  They were HUGE !!! but tasted like something i could have very well made at home.  My son had Mickey Mouse shaped pancakes with a fruit face and bacon mouth.  He loved that part but that was about it.  All in all it was 'ok'.....i may or may not go back....im reading about all the yummy stuff that my diet doesn't aloud perhaps on my next cheat day ill try again.",

So good the wife and I went two days in a row during a recent visit to Vegas.   4 Star Breakdown from two days:  WAIT TIME: 4* Day 1 : Long ( We were told 15min , and it ended up being over 30min wait.)  Day 2 : Quick ( seated in about 5- 10 min. )  Food: AMAZING!!!! 5*  Service: 4* ( They have clever yellow / black eggs as signs that you need help)  Day 1 : Had a server by the name of Amanda, who ROCKED!!! She was the perfect      host, and made the experience great. (she gets 5 *+ )  Day 2: Never got the servers name( skinny preggo chick), she never came buy often, and when she did, she would completely forget about stuff we asked for. The guy next to us sat there for a good 20min before she took his drink order, and even longer to get him his meal. I had asked for a refill of water, and she seemed to bring water to everyone around us, except for me. The she abruptly brought us our bill that we had not asked for , while we were still eating, and didn't even ask if we wanted anything else. Oh yeah I still hadn't gotten my water, so I asked her again and finally as we were getting up to leave, she brought water.   Overall, This is a MUST when I'm in Vegas.",

It sells every breakfast dish that has to do with eggs. We ordered Grandma's Biscuits & Gravy and Stuffed French Toast. Both tasted good and homemade.  Service was excellent (thanks Jessica!), portions are humongous, and price was reasonable.  Will definitely return if in the area again.",

It was really crowded but there was only a 10 minute wait.  We ordered the croissant sandwich, I had mines with turkey sausage and fruits and she had hers with bacon and potatoes.   Service was great, food came out fast. Casual dining, indoor/outdoor seating, private lot. meal for 2 cost around $26.   I'll be back for more.  Egg & I makes my breakfast in 702 list! If you're looking to get your morning fix, stop by Egg & I!   -Miss Yelp 2011",

    "text": "I would say this place was pretty good! We waited about 10 minutes for any service once seated at our table. The place was packed and it was 1 p.m. on a Monday!  The average breakfast is about 10 bucks and 3 more for coffee. I would say sharing is a must!!! The omelets were super cheesy but tasty. The Cajun potatoes are awkwardly addicting. At first bite they taste over seasoned with cajun powder but by the end of it you will wish you had more. The banana nut muffin comes with your entree or free check in on foursquare. It's definitely not the best muffin int he world like others claim, but it is tasty. However, eat it hot or it might taste dry. And eat it with the butter then its perfection. Overall with sharing, free extra muffin, and two iced coffees and tip it was 23 dollars. Don't know if I will be back as there is too many other places to try.",

And, oh, the food is really really good.  Prices a bit high but quality and portions are excellent.  My wife had the cheddar cheese omelet....it looked so pretty you almost didn't want to eat it.   Light, cheesy and oh so good.  Banana nut muffin equally good.  I had the piggy skillet....layered with potatos, ham, sausage, bacon and cheese, with a couple eggs on top.  Delicious.",

We recently visited Egg & I for breakfast with a group of six.  We arrived about 10:30 in the morning.  There was a considerable waiting line.  However, the hostess was very sweet and efficient. The estimated 20 minutes wait was actually more like 10 minutes.  Our waitress (sadly I didn't get her name) was incredible, attentive without being overbearing, quick and efficient.  Once our orders were taken, the food arrived fairly quickly, no mistakes or wrong items.  We pretty much all ordered something different.  I had the house made (not canned) corn beef hash and eggs.  Excellent.  Can't remember what everybody had but all raved about their food. Avoid the strip with it's lines and cheesy buffets and overpriced breakfasts and check this place out.  Just a short drive from the strip.  Mostly locals and a few visitors.  A gem!",

Having recently myself joined the customer service industry it is extremely Refreshing to see people that care about their employees. This place is highly recommended and I can see why. I ordered the works veggie Benny while there and it came out perfectly cooked as it should. The veggies looked fresh and the plates were extremely clean with ample size of food. I tend to like my eggs a little more on the medium done so I politely asked Paula if they could just put my plate in the microwave just to cook it a little bit because I didn't necessarily want a new order. In an attempt to maintain the perfect service that this place is known for, Paula listened intently to my concern and did something I did not expect she offered to have them prepare a new half Benedict which is what I had remaining versus simply warming up what I had. I was extremely touched by this. Thank you so much Paula for making my experience in Vegas a great one. She also agreed to take a photo of me while I was at the restaurant having my breakfast. She is truly a model of what great customer service should be and I applaud this lady for her natural caring skills. Bravo Paula and kuddos to you Eggs & I for not just great food in great portions but great staff as well. I will definitely be back!",

We were seated inside, and it was really bustling.  With our Yelp check-in, we each received a free banana nut muffin, which was REALLY tasty. I ordered the Vegetarian Benedict (with bacon) and my husband ordered the Biscuits and Gravy and Blueberry Pancakes. My Benedict was really, really good, but I will say their hollandaise is seriously lacking in lemon juice. It didn't seem like an authentic hollandaise at all, but it tasted good. They know how to poach an egg beautifully, which made up for the sauce. The breakfast potatoes that come with every entree are very flavorful and crispy. My husband really liked his biscuits & gravy (he said the biscuits were very light and fluffy), but the pancakes were a huge bust for both of us. They were way too dense - the texture was pretty awful. I'm assuming that's how all their pancake batter is, so I'd hard pass on pancakes there.  It was fun to venture off the Strip, but we'll probably stick with breakfast elsewhere in the future. HOWEVER, they offer an extremely generous military discount of 30%, which we appreciated. We didn't even ask for it, but when I opened my wallet, she noticed my military ID and offered it up.",

We got to the restaurant around 8:30 AM on a Sunday and didn't have to wait for a table. The place started filling up soon after and we looked to be the only non-locals there.  We ordered the Three Pigs Omelette and Works Veggie Benny to share. Both come with a huge helping of their Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. I love fried potatoes so I inhaled all of mine, which was a nice little accomplishment because the plates was huge and the potatoes took up half the plate! If you order an omelette, you also get a choice of toast or their famous homemade banana nut muffin. We read reviews and perused photos beforehand so of course we chose the muffin. You also get a free muffin with Yelp check-in so be sure to do so!  The banana nut muffins here are everything you could ever want in a muffin. Moist, fluffy, flavorful, and warm--they blow all other muffins I have ever had way out of the water. My mouth is watering as I write because they are THAT good.   The Three Pigs Omelette was stuffed with diced ham, bacon, and sausage and topped with cheddar and jack cheese. It was good but we should have ordered something more exciting. The menu here is extensive but our waitress kind of rushed us to order. I am guessing she's used to local patrons who order quickly. The Works Veggie Benny was incredibly satisfying. The hollandaise sauce was as egg-ceptional as the menu claims and the combination of the sauce with the fresh spinach, grilled tomatoes, sliced avocado, and perfectly poached eggs was spot-on!",

They have outdoor seating available so we opted to get a table on their outdoor patio. We were seated right away with no waiting time.   The menus offered a variety of breakfast options.  Upon first checking in on yelp, I got a free banana nut muffin offer. The waitress went ahead and honored my free muffin but she also brought one out for everyone one else to try since it was our first time there.   Dave and I ordered the country fried steak, 2 eggs and home fries. We also ordered a side of pancakes.   Overall food and service was good.  Check out the pics.  Nice little breakfast place.",

If not for the abundance of salt (way too much) it wouldn't have any taste. (Think Salty Cardboard) The biscuit and gravy looked great, again so salty, literally made it inedible.

We were first introduced to Egg & I a few years ago when we were just about to depart Las Vegas to head home to California. We saw the many positive reviews and were very impressed! This establishment has the homey feel with servers who are friendly to customers like family. The unfortunate thing is that sometimes there will be a long wait especially during rush breakfast/brunch hours.  Parking: Located in a huge parking lot with other establishments. I don't remember it to be very difficult at all.  We ordered the Santa Cruz Burrito that includes a side of the Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes ($11.75). We liked this burrito, but unfortunately at that time, it wasn't something we were in the mood for. I think we wanted something like a bacon burrito, which is what we will order next time. However, we thoroughly enjoyed the Eggworks Breakfast Sandwich with bacon ($10.99) that also included the Habla Diablo seasoned potatoes. This sandwich was exactly what we were craving! I think we would definitely want to order this again in the future. In addition, the Habla Diablo potatoes hit the spot... they were cut up into small squares and perfectly crunchy and spicy. I would want to get another side of these potatoes just because!",

The Crazy Chicken has shredded chicken, guacamole, mushrooms, and a ridiculous amount of Meunster cheese and sour cream. I could not finish it all. The chicken was under seasoned and guacamole tasteless... It was a cheese show for sure. Not that I have anything against cheese, but what should have been the star of the show was the under study in this dish.  The Island Favorite is all the Hawaiian goodies, Portuguese sausage, a Ham steak, pineapple, rice, and eggs served to order. The sausage seems to always be the barometer in these dishes as to being authentic and what brands of sausage are popular in Hawaii. The taste was consistent with this and also was grilled well and crispy.  I am not opposed to going back, but I won't be rushing.",

The parking lot had a lot of space, so finding a spot is nothing to worry about.   Upon entering, the place was EXTREMELY packed. We had to wait quite a bit, but this wasn't a problem at all. Although I do wish there were more chairs indoors so other people could sit down while waiting in the front area of the restaurant. After being seated we were given menus which were creatively in newspaper form, so it was like we were reading our morning newspaper while waiting for breakfast!   Everyone at the table ordered some freshly squeeze orange juice after being questioned by the waiter. In addition, I ordered a crepe and a strawberry french toast. The orange juice and crepe was nothing special, but the sauce definitely was delicious and spiced up the meal 1000%. However, THE BANANA MUFFIN was something else. It was soft, warm and delicious (probably the best part of the meal).   Overall the food and service was pretty good, this place is a very cute breakfast place and definitely worth a try!",

I ordered the veggie omelet with cheese on top and a side of potatoes, it was a delicious breakfast, portions are big, but quality of food tastes great.   The reason of my rating is service, may be was because it was at a busy hour, but everything took longer than usual, we were sitting for like 15 min when finally a waitress came to hour table, I had to ask for a fork 3 times (didn't have the usual silverware with a napkin when I arrived).   But other than that food is good! I would recommend this place for breakfast I think is worth the wait if you're not that hungry and have time.  Great for everyone!   -Spanish:  Si estas en busca de un tradicional desayuno americano, esta es una gran opcion para probar, pero si tienes mucha hambre fijate bien cuales son las horas ocupadas por que para una mesa podras esperar un buen rato, claro todo esto debido a que la comida tiene un gran sabor!   Mi orden fue un omelet vegetariano con queso arriba y una guarnicion de papas. Las porciones son bastas y el sabor delicioso.   La razon de mis 4 estrellas se debio al servicio de mi experiencia. Todo tardaba mucho desde que nos sentamos la mesera tomo 15 min para apenas a cercarse a preguntar que queriamos de beber, cuando por fin llego la comida, tuve que pedir 3 veces cubiertos ya que al llegar no estaban como normalmente los cubiertos envueltos en una servilleta, y la mesera olvidaba. Tal vez esto paso debido a que era una hora ocupada.   Pero en resumen la comida es buena, si recomiendo este lugar para desayuno! y como tip solamente pregunten que horas son las ocupadas, pero si tienes tiempo y tu apetito puede esperar entonces cualquier hora es buena!  Perfecto para toda la familia!",

Yeah you come this city hoping to escape into another reality, but it's nice to come down from the clouds once in a while.  The one thing I have to admire is there amazing variety of amazing egg selections. I Decided on going with their Chile Relleno Omelette, which was on the money, but their Banana Nut Muffin is THE thing to get.   Listen, if you feel like wondering off the strip for some good home eatin', why not here??",

She definitely needs to be retrained. Giving this review 5 stars in consideration of how embarrassed our server looked at that moment && because this is our favorite place in Vegas!",

I got the vegetable omelette, good amount of 4 eggs, had spinach, mushroom, bell pepper and probably onion.  Nothing fragrant that stood out, but it did the trick.  The meal came with plateful of mini squared potatoes.  At first glance, you can see all the seasoning and it taste over seasoned. My only gripe, was they had MSG sprinkled all over it.  I didn't realize it until my thirst level started to slowly creep up.  I took another close look and felt sick to my stomach.  Why, do you need MSG in fried potatoes? Why?  To end on a good note, I really enjoyed my slice of grapefruit and honeydew and opted not to order the muffin or toast.   I should have stuck with good old Blueberry Hills Family.",

(My son and BF always finish their plates though.)  They also have rice plates, 3 choices, Hawaiin style. YUM!  DRINkS: Mimosa is not unlimited. But soft drinks and coffee are. Also if you order juice, they'd give you a carafe.  PRICE: decent price. They accept Amex. Pay at the cashier once you receive your receipt.   RESTROOM: small but clean.   SPACE: big space, good for groups. They also have outdoor seating.  SERVICE: fast (once seated) and efficient friendly staff.",

Definitely get the homemade banana nut muffin-it's moist, not too sweet but sweet enough with the right amount of flavor between banana and nut. They offer this with most of their breakfast items. I ordered the veggie omelet with slices of avocado-delish! Bacon was crispy and done-I don't like wet partially done bacon. Coffee was ok, not great but not bad so it worked.   Service-ok. No smiles, just business as usual. And we sometimes had trouble getting the waitress to notice we needed more coffee and water. This is why I'm only giving this place four stars.",

I sent it back, and had the Works omelette which is loaded with bacon, ham, sausage, onions, tomatoes, green bell peppers, mushrooms, and cheddar and jack cheeses.

I had the biscuits with gravy with eggs and it was a decadent and savory dish...perfect to start the day.  I had a banana nut muffin, which was also good.  The menu is HUGE, so take your time in figuring out what appeals most...there's definitely something for everyone.",

Our waitress Carole Ann was so sweet and very attentive. She made us feel welcomed and comfortable right away. I would definitely recommend asking for Carole, she'll make your dining experience great. Thank you for the wonderful service and kindness Carole! We ordered the original breakfast burrito and pancakes both were soooo good! I added spinach to the breakfast burrito and it seriously looked like work of art when it came out, you could see the layers of bacon, cheese, eggs, spinach and potatoes. The salsa that came with the burrito was the best salsa I've had in a while and of course the Diablo potatoes are addicting. The pancakes were moist and fluffy. So much yummmm!",

The sunrise mountain, which was a croissant underneath scrambled eggs with bacon and cheese, didn't taste too spectacular either and can probably be easily duplicated at home. It looked better than it tasted.  The potatoes, on the other hand, were seasoned well and tasty. Probably the highlight of our dishes.

We were seated promptly by the hostess podium, strike 1, tell me who wants to sit where you can hear the conversations between the girls as they seat people.  The server was pleasant and why I give this a 2 Star rating but the food was mediocre. My waffle was cold and not crunchy, the butter couldn't melt on a cold waffle so I had to use syrup. The ham and eggs were cold too, overall, not impressed, strike 2.  My friend had the bacon, egg & potato skillet and was also disappointed bc it was too salty and warm, not hot, strike 3.  I'm out, not on our list when we return to Vegas, sad really because I had high hopes after reading the reviews.",

I have had better egg Benedict at Bill's cafe in our bay area, the prime rib was salty for me, but the stuffed french toast was very unique and tasty. Also the banana muffins are really good.

Highly recommend this place for breakfast - Very reasonable prices for quality & portions.  ($23-24 total for Eggs Benedict & Biscuits & Gravy)  The eggs benedict are our favorite here (totally smothered with Hollandaise).  FYI - They serve their \"Diablo Potatoes\", but change to Hash Browns or unseasoned potatoes if ordering for kids or watching sodium (The Diablo version appears to be just a ton of seasoned salt added.)  Excellent & friendly service!  NOTE:  Not a fan of giving up a cell number so they can text you when your table's ready.  We didn't - We're kinda paranoid about giving out any info as it can become part of a unsolicited marketing email spam.  (Not saying that's what they do, but we just don't do it.)",

The hash was mushy, the hot cocoa was definitely from a packet- not top quality. We were OK though with everything- staff was nice, etc. However, when my Mom ordered her hash she specifically asked for the egg whites to be cooked through in her eggs. When she got through some of the eggs, however, she raised a bite that had completely raw egg hanging from it- not just undercooked, but raw. When we informed the waiter he asked would she like a replacement or price adjustment, and she requested the latter. When we got the check, $2.25 had been reduced on the check. We went to talk to the manager, who then confirmed multiple times that they refunded the price of the two eggs on top (even though they were not ordered a la carte), and that was their policy- even though they served my Mom not food she just didn't want, but food that was unsafe. Incredibly disappointing seeing as I work in food service myself.",

Came on Monday, June 9th for breakfast and from the time we walked in to the time we walked out we had exceptional customer service by Gia the manager and our waitress, Carole Ann.   They were both very personable.  We we're seated promptly in the back next to the kitchen by Gia.  Carole Ann came by to acknowledge us but would be right back because she had to sing happy birthday at a table.  No biggie as we were on vacation and wasn't in a rush to go anywhere.    Gia came by and apologized but no need to apologize for the delay.  She came out with two banana muffins for us while we waited and took our drink orders and came out with it.  Those muffins were delicious.  Carole Ann came back and took our order.  I ordered the spam and egg over rice.  That came with a muffin or toast and since we already got the muffin I thought that was it.  But she offered me toast or another muffin to take home, but I declined.   My other half ordered a chorizo skillet.    The food and service was great and I would have def gone back but my intentions while I was in Vegas was to visit a different restaurant everyday.    They don't take American Express, not sure if it's just at this location.   Thank you Carole Ann for great customer service, keep it up and I hope you get to meet Mickey Mouse!!!",

Had the plain waffle in my meal and is was light and airy. The syrup is the exact amount of sweet, you not to sweet where it feels like you are drinking straight from the bottle but not so light you think it's a diabetic sugar supplement. The service was great! The only knock on this place is its a little cramped considered how popular it is and how many people are there.",

The wait wasn't as long as Hash House...it was only about 15 minute for an outside table. The menu is huge and appealing that none of us could make up our minds on what to order. Eventually we did, 2 friends got the eggs Benedict and pancakes, another got the steak and eggs with rice and I got the spinach and avocado omelet with fruits and I shared the strawberry creme french toast with a friend. The ambiance is like any ordinary breakfast joint with that \"home\" and \"granny's house\" feeling.   Everyone loved their foods, but it was so much that they couldn't finish it except for my friend who got the steak and eggs. I for one cold not even eat half of my food, regardless of how delicious it is....and I can eat a whole lot. I loved that my omelet was full of fresh huge slices of avocado and spinach inside my omelet. The fruits were fairly fresh and sweet. My whole plate cost me about $118 with tip so not bad considering I had a yummy Easter omelet, fruits and a huge delicious stack of french toast. Sadly, none of us took our food to go because we were on the road doing errands that day.   Next time I hit up Vegas, I'll be sure to come here for breakfast!",

The host and servers both gave us a warm welcome. My favorite part of the table set up was their egg signal at the top of their center piece. It was a photo of an egg that you could flip to indicate to servers that you needed something. No one waving your hand to try to get the servers attention, they got a system down!  Next, the food, I ordered corned beef hash and eggs, while my friend customized her scramble with chorizo plus biscuits and gravy.. The bf got some avocado omelette. All were delicious and the portions were huge! It looked like I barley made a dent in my food, but I was stuffed. The biscuits and gravy were probably some of the best I've had... And their banana nut muffins are worth a try for muffin fiends. Straight out of the oven to your table.  Good service, good food, and great company.. All for a reasonable price. I think this place is going to become a must stop for all my Vegas trips from now on! Thank you Egg & I!",

Me: Breakfast burrito sub turkey sausage for bacon (because I'm watching my waist line... *crickets*). Heaven.   Although everything we had was delicious, what really made a mark was the homemade salsa they served and the Hablo Diabla seasoning they use. So delicious and one of a kind. One of a kind is hard to find these days with so many restaurants out there in competition but these guys really do have something special.  Service was prompt and cheery.

The servers are always smiling and genuinely kind. They are constantly concerned about your food and if everything is tasting good.   FOOD: 3 - My disclaimer: I really only came here to eat eggs. I did not want any meat other than bacon. I strictly came here for really, really plain ol' breakfast food, and not anything else.  I got a really boring item called \"The Classic\", but I really wanted just eggs and bacon, so that's what I went with. My over easy eggs were cooked perfectly. I mean, they were absolutely perfect. Some cooks leave the yolk barely runny on the inside, but they are experts at eggs here..and I have no complaints.   The banana nut muffin was soft and moist, but I just didn't like the taste of it. I think I'm just picky, but the banana in the muffin tasted a little ripe. The potatoes were good, but they weren't great. The bacon was a little overcooked and a little too hard for me.   I totally forgot to check Yelp before ordering, but next time, I'll order a healthy omelet and see how that goes!!",

Upon arrival at 7am there was nobody there so make sure you come early if you don't want to wait. I checked in for the delicious free banana nut muffin. The menu was pretty big and after scoping for a minute I decided on the blackened prime rib benny. The benedict was perfectly constructed . Tender prime rib, poached eggs, and some gravy was served on a crossaint, the flavor was also on point! 30 minutes later I'm headed out the door! Mission breakfast accomplished.",

You MUST try this at least once although I'm sure it won't just be once! I also ordered the Stuffed French Toast and eliminated the meat. Before I can ask what are my other options Karla recommended veggies! Stuffed French toast with scrambled eggs, spinach and mushrooms. It also came with deliciously seasoned potatoes. I can't wait to go back to Vegas, so I can come back to this place for breakfast!   I'm saying good-bye to brunch at the buffets and saying hello to Egg & I! I found my Vegas breakfast spot!",

The manager was also hustling, checking how people were doing, and clearing tables. We had a Loco Moco that tasted as good as in Hawaii. The yummy banana nut muffins taste like something grandma made. The potatoes were crispy, not greasy, and well-seasoned. The eggs benedict had fresh spinach and the hollandaise was delicious. We'll definitely come back when we're in town.",

    "text": "This breakfast joint is a must have for anyone visiting Vegas. When I go on trips that involve Vegas, I've started planning the itinerary to let me go to Eggs & I for breakfast. It is a slight trek from the strip, but totally worth it.  For my most recent visit I got the Ensenada Burrito and my wife got the Banana Bread French Toast. The Ensenada Burrito was a recommendation from my server Amanda and I'm so glad I listened to her. The burrito was delicious. Tasty meat and eggs in the burrito and topped with a healthy amount of cheese. Plus, it came with a side of their potatoes (what they call habla diablo seasoned potatoes) which are some of my favorite breakfast potatoes. So good. My wife's french toast was sweet and delicious. The service was top notch. Amanda (our server) was cheerful and seemed genuinely excited to help us figure out what to eat.  Oh, and they have this black/yellow egg heads on each table to notify the staff if you need help (Black smiley face = you're ok, Yellow frowny face = need assistant). The staff watches this like hawks. Each time we flipped it, a staff member (not just your server) is right there to help. We were in a rush and needed the check... flipped it... 5 seconds later a staff member was there... 30 seconds later our server gave us our check. It was awesome.  Overall, I can't say enough about this place. It is one of the best breakfast places in Vegas (if not THE best). The wait is quick, the service is great, and the food is top notch.",

I ordered over easy, sourdough, medium rare and potatoes diablo.  Of course I had to have coffee as well. Coffee and water arrived first.  The coffee was in a hot pot with at least a quart of delicious coffee.  Water was reverse osmosis and highly drinkable. My steak was cooked to order, but cold.  The waitress rescued me and soon a nice hot steak and eggs order was in front of me. I enjoyed it for the duration of everything on the plate except I could not finish the potatoes! Assorted jellies included a rarity: mixed fruit.  Nice! Good Breakfast stop!",

We went on a Saturday and we got seated right away, no wait.  But as we left, there was a line and that was around 1:00pm. I love corn beef hash and so I had to try their corn beef hash.  It came with eggs and toast (can choose muffin instead of toast) and if you check in on yelp you get a free banana muffin.  Our waitress forgot ours but we didn't make a big deal about it.  Corn beef hash was shredded style and I thought it was below par.  Not the best corn beef.  The place reminded me of another Dennys. Dennys being better. The restaurant also sells merchandise and sauces at the entrance.",

It was about a 10 min. car trip from Caesars but TOTALLY WORTH IT! I had THE BEST Home fries ever! I dont know what seasoning they use, and would LOVE to find out, but they were amazing! My son had pancakes and they were so soft and fluffy! The coffee is left in a urn on your table so you don't have to wait for refills. They have french vanilla creamers too. The service was wonderful! The place is so cute and I can guarantee I WILL GO BACK on my next vacation to Vegas. It is well worth the trip! Great prices! Great service! Just downright YUMMY! LARGE Portions too! Be warned..you wont be hungry the rest of the day! Coffee is really good too and I DONT Drink folgers!",

This place is the best.  Since we were there during the week, there was no wait but busy.  The menu was so extensive my husband and I took at least 10-15 minutes just to read and decide.  We wanted EVERYTHING!  I went for the Piggy Skillet and was absolutely overwhelmed.  It was fabulous.  My husband and I were so pleased with the food and service, we made sure this was the last place we ate before leaving town.  And I took a banana nut muffin on the plane home. I wanted to buy a whole loaf but my husband gave me a dirty look.  I gained four pounds while I was in Vegas and I am sure three of them were courtesy of The Egg & I!",

    "text": "My wife and I found this place via Yelp and with the help of the turn by turn navigation, discovered the BEST breakfast we ever had!!  The banana nut muffin comes before the meal and it is SUPERB!!  Everything we ordered was FANTASTIC!!  The eggs (over-easy), the bacon, the link sausages, the pancakes, and of course the waffle (loaded with strawberries and whipped cream) could not get any better.  We visit Las Vegas at least 3 times a year and this time we were celebrating our 7th year anniversary.  We've done the hotel dining thing at most of the 4 & 5 star rated places and they don't even come close to being as good as the Egg & I.  We do have to thank Denny's for being so awful the morning before and that is what led us to the BEST BREAKFAST in fabulous Las Vegas.  Being from Hawaii, it was a pleasant surprise to see a \"hawaiian\" section in the menu.  A lot of Hawaii people visit the 9th island and we will definitely be telling our friends about this wonderful eatery on West Sahara.",

This was breakfast heaven. The wait staff was outstanding (ask for Sam if she's there), the service was prompt, the portions were plentiful, the price was appropriate for the size of the portions and the food was absolutely phenomenal. Get the banana nut muffin whether it's included or not. It was so good, it tasted like a dessert. To add butter or anything else to it would be a crime, it was perfect the way it was. My wife had waffles with strawberries and whipped cream. Typically, she does not eat large portion meals without sliding some of it across the table to me. She polished off the whole thing. I had some kind of special that came with four scrambled eggs mixed with bacon, spinach, mushrooms and loads of cheese and some kind of side of potatoes that was eye-rolling awesome. I've been on this planet for over half a century and I honestly don't remember the last time I had a breakfast that tasted this good from start to finish. According to Sam, everything on the menu can be modified or customized to taste and size. This place is almost a reason to go to Vegas if for no other reason. I highly recommend it.",

It was so hard to choose something from the menu...everything sounded so good! They have something for everyone. I had the the \"Egg-Ceptional Omelette\" with a side of country potatoes and my, was it exceptional! The omelet was loaded with sausage, diced ham, onions, tomatoes, sliced mushrooms, bacon, and cheese...and topped with sour cream. yummm! My husband had our usual...eggs benedict...and that was very delicious as well. The portions are huge! My husband eats like a beast...and I, like a man...and we still couldn't finish our food. Our waitress was very sweet and attentive. She came back periodically to tend to us with a huge smile on her face. Also, the food came out very fast!

They were packed but the wait for indoor seating for only a little over 5 minutes. They offer Hispanic style breakfast and their potatoes are AMAZING. My sister got the Mexican Omelette that came with 6 different kinds of fruits; grapefruit, watermelon, pineapple, orange, cantaloupe, and honeydew. They were all impressively fresh and sweet! I ordered the \"Works\" egg skillet with poached eggs (you can get eggs any way you like) and the portion is so large that I was only able to eat half of it. Make sure to go for their homemade banana muffins because these are the best I've had. I also received a free one at the time of this review from checking in on Yelp! BE WARE OF THE ZIOSK TABLETS on the table! I just clicked on a couple of things to check the options out and was unknowing charged $1.99 for game play. Mind you, I didn't even play the game! I am usually very careful and read all the fine prints and I can assure you that the price was not mentioned! I was under the impression that it was all free. I'm sure it's a problem for families as children gravitate to these tablets while waiting for the food. Other than that, service was fast and friendly!",

I didn't know if I should order the chili rellano omelet the Mexican... I went with .....  The chicken enchilada omelet was delish! I had reservations because I normally eat green enchilada sauce. This was smothered in a homemade enchilada sauce which was very good.  The potatoes surprised me too. I didn't expect to like them because there was no onion or bell pepper, just some red seasoning. But they were good also.   A variety of smuckers jellies ready for your toast and they even have a variety of flavored coffee creamers. My only complaint was that the carafe coffee is on the weak side. That's the reason they couldn't get that 5th star.    So I can not wait to go back and try something else.   Oh, did I mention the staff? They are great!! Very attentive and caring. They have the cutest way to signal that you need attention.  I'm not going to tell you.

The had 2 hosts, one was seating, one was just adding to the waitlist. The entrance area was extremely crowded due to many guests waited for their table. We were seated and our server immediately greeted us and asked for our beverage order. We ordered coffee, apple juice, waters and placed our order for the famous cinnamon roll. We received out drinks within few minutes. Our server asked if we were ready for our order and we were as we previously studied the menu. We ordered corn beef hash served with breakfast potatoes and 2 slices of wheat toast, blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon. Right after we were served the cinnamon roll and OMG, please order one if you like cinnamon rolls. The icing was melting into the dough which was so warm, fresh, and fluffy. We just looked at each other and agreed how delicious it was. The cinnamon roll was eaten quickly. We received our order about 8 minutes after. The Corn Beef Hash is served in a skillet with eggs on top and a generous portion fried breakfast potatoes that were well seasoned. The blueberry pancakes were nice and fluffy and my girl only was able to finish one of the two due to the size.  All the food was very delicious and the service was quick and friendly.  We will certainly return on our next LV visit.",

My husband didn't hear me order it so I thought I didn't so that is why I didn't ask the waitress.    Everything was very enjoyable and I will be back next time I am in Vegas. :)",

They do pride themselves on service and our waitress was a doll.   You get a free banana muffin with Yelp Check in. But the portions are so huge we didn't really need it - INSIDER TIP - after we were all done, the waitress told us you could get Half orders of almost anything. (wish we had known)  I had the corned beef hash, which was okay. My man had the chili relleno omelet (he loved it) and my friend had the huevos with carnitas, (and green sauce) - IT WAS OUTSTANDING)",

    "text": "Finally tried this place out after hearing from my friends that this is one of the best breakfast spots and I was underwhelmed. When you arrive you put your name on the list and they will text you when your table is ready which is nice if you wanna stand outside since the inside is super crowded. We went on a Wednesday morning around 10:30 AM and there was about a 20-minute wait. They have some benches inside to sit but that also serves as a storage unit so people were always asking us to move to get to the supplies under the benches which was kinda annoying.   Once we were seated we waited for about 10 minutes for our server. Another server noticed we were waiting and she kindly stepped in and took our drink order. Our actual server was not as friendly and did not seem apologetic for the wait and just asked us \"what do you want\" which was slightly off-putting...  For food, we ordered the Prime Rib Benedict which was too salty and the meat was way overcooked so we ended up not even eating the meat. We also ordered the corned beef which was just okay. The best part was the banana nut muffin so definitely try that out! The portions of the food were decent so if I go back I would order something else.",

Service was fast, waitresses were kind and quick. Husband ordered the hash skillet it was amazing, like, mouthgasm amazing. When it came to the table it didn't look like it was going to be that good, but wow. I ordered a chicken fried steak breakfast with over easy eggs, gravy was portioned well, not overly done, steak fried perfectly, not greasy, but crispy even with the layer of gravy. Their potatoes are pretty interesting diced/cubed with like a season salt, have a nice crunch to them. The portion sizes here are absurdly large, I think we could've easily shared one of these breakfasts plates and been satisfied. We both weren't able to finish either plate. They also come with a side of toast or a muffin. Only downside I'd say is the coffee price is a bit on the steep side, but they do leave you a jug, at your table so you don't need to flag someone down and you're supplied with all your needs at your table.",

They have a helpful little sign where you can flip it to yellow if you need assistance at your table - we never had to use it once.   The food was also amaaazing. I am a huge breakfast fan and have been to tons of breakfast places. They had the best chicken fried steak I've ever had, and there was so much of it I had the leftovers for lunch and was full all over again. Definitely worth the price. They give you so, so much food!

    "text": "My friends who frequent Las Vegas highly recommended this place to me! Thank you Maria M. and Dave O.!!  This breakfast joint is cute, welcoming and homey. It gets pretty packed during the weekends, especially with big parties, so be prepared to wait! But if anything, the food is worth the wait.  The selection of different types of dishes included dozens of omelettes done all kinds of ways, eggs benedict, eggs florentine, egg crepes, skillets, and i could go on and on because they also have sandwiches, french toast, and seriously I can go on..   I got the ham and mushrooms skillet with blue berry muffin. The muffin was moist and fresh! The skillet was their infamous ranch potatoes topped with ham and mushrooms with a layer of melted cheeses and two eggs done however you liked. Honestly, it looked super huge and I thought I would not finish it, but it was so good I annihilated that sucker!  My friend tried the ultimate skillet which had ham, bacon,  sausage and other goodies, but he said that it was waaaay too many things going on in one dish. So unless you like something super hearty and packed, try the ultimate skillet, if not, choose one or two ingredients to put into it.  Service was super friendly and kind. On the table there are these flip cards with a happy and sad face. Put up your happy face is your party is doing fine, but if you need anything put up the sad face and a server will attend to you quickly.  When I come back to vegas, this is a definite visit, especially after a big hangover!",

    "text": "AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME food!  A normal trip to Vegas for me and my girlfriend tends to be limited to the strip, but having driven out from San Diego, we decided to venture away from the concrete jungle for breakfast.  I looked on yelp, found this place and we started driving.  Here's all you need to know:  1. There were a lot of people waiting outside, and we almost just left.  For a two-top, we waited 20 minutes (which seemed more than reasonable for a Saturday morning). 2. The food came WICKED-FAST.  Like, 5 minutes MAX.  2 orders of eggs bene and a plate of pancakes.  CRAZY FAST. 3. I am an eggs benedict officianado, and theirs was MAGNIFICENT.  The eggs benedict was probably the best I've ever had, and the \"ranch-style\" potatoes that accompanied it were fantastic as well. 4. The prices were very reasonable.  100% Guaranteed that I will come back to this place next time I'm in Vegas.  RANDOM NOTE:  After picking up our pup from a doggy hotel near the airport, we considered driving way back to this place for breakfast one more time.  By PURE LUCK, we saw a sign for \"Egg Works\", stumbled in and discovered that it was the SAME COMPANY.  1 in a million chance and a very happy ending for our trip.  The food was equally as good as The Egg and I.",

The place is packed and there is always a wait, but 15 minutes of my time is fine by me as long as I am going to enjoy the food. If you know my reviewing you will see that service, and location are not heavy factors in my rating. I am a total foody, so what is most important is the taste, the quality, and selection of foods offered. What I ordered this time was the Bandito omelette, I enjoyed it. The last time I ordered the Chile relleno omelette, it was delicious! I liked it more than the Bandito. it came with a banana but muffin, which I finished even I told myself to fight the temptation. my kids ordered the strawberry stuffed French toast, I forget the name of it but it was stuffed with cream cheese and strawberries. they wanted to lick the plate. When we go to Vegas we won't have to think twice about it, we will be there.",

The best meal I have ever eaten was the breakfast I ate on my trip to Las Vegas t at The Egg and I on West Sahara. This is a locals eatery.  I ate the standard, eggs, sausage, bacon, toast, and hash browns. On the menu it is called \"Eggs - Plus\". I added the sausage a la carte. As I was eating, the taste of the meal brought a smile to my face.   The eggs were very good. Not greasy or salty. Very tasty.   The bacon was the best I ever had. Not too salty, not soggy, and not overcooked.   The turkey sausage was the best I ever had. Not greasy or salty. Tasty.   The hash browns were the best I have ever had. These were the square pieces of potato type of hash browns. Usually this type of hash browns is greasy, heavy, and dense. These were light, airy, and had some type of paprika seasoning.   The toast was the best I ever had. Light and fluffy whole wheat bread. Not dense.   The oj was great as well.  It is located about 10-15 minutes from South Las Vegas Boulevard. Well worth the trip!",

Luckily for us, the weather was nice and cool, so outside was just fine. You can also bring your pet with you on the outside, but you need to make sure it's well behaved. I ended up getting the eggs-taliano and a side of the chipotle hollandaise sauce. Both were very good. Since it was a little cooler outside, probably around mid 60s, I ordered some tea. It came with a couple wedges of lemon and honey. The hot water was in a thermos kettle which didn't pour that fast, so I look inside to see why and noticed that there was a bit of grime or something near the spout. Needless to say, I didn't drink the tea after that. Other than that, taste of the food and the service made up a little for that.",

She was very attentive And was there in a jiffy. I do love me some good service. I had the Santa a Cruz scramble which did not disappoint. For the big eaters it's big enough to split you can have your choice of Toast or their famous Banana Nut Muffin. By the way Yelp check in gets you a free Muffin. Love me some rewards. My Skillet was delicious. Very fresh with all the fixings. This place will definitely be in my Vegas rotation. Parking can be an issue it seems, but the area seems busy. Not to mention several out of town license plates which equates to people trying to get their directions straight. At any rate don't be denied. This place is worth the off the strip adventure.",

On top of that, no one tell us that we have to pay for hot water!  If I knew, I would've order hot tea instead of ice water... at least I got tea at the end!  Second, we tried their chili.....it was horrible!  We only had couple bites, I was kinda tired and busy taking care of the baby...otherwise I'll ask them to cancel the or exchange to something else, in the same time ask them to give me a tea bag for that $3.00 hot water cost!

We called ahead to see our wait time and they offered to put our name down, so by the time we arrived half an hour later, our tables was all ready for a group of 15 --perfect! Our server was also super sweet and constantly checked on us while even offering everyone in the table a free banana nut muffin. I did claim the Yelp check-in for the free muffin, but she was kind enough to just give everyone in our table one. What was even more wonderful was that one of our party members is allergic to nuts, so they gave her a blueberry muffin in replacement.  For food, I ordered the Chicken, Mushroom, and Spinach Skillet with sourdough toast ($10.25). I also shared with the boyfriend as he got the Stuffed French Toast ($9.75). When you're ordering here, I know your eyes are going to speak louder than your stomach, but I can guarantee that you'll be stuffed by the end of the meal. I highly recommend the Stuffed French Toast. It was the perfect blend of savory and sweet with a sausage, cheese and egg mixture folded between french toast. The syrup it comes with is lightly sweet and simply tastes amazing altogether. Of course, you'll end up a little sticky but it's worth the battle. Their potatoes are no ordinary potatoes either. They give you a plate full of potatoes covered with cajun seasoning --so delicious! Not to forget the skillet I ordered, because that was very tasty as well. They melted so much cheese over my potatoes, which was my favorite part. I only had 1/4 of the skillet and was too full to continue.  When paying, we always struggle with a huge group. They have you pay up front and were very patient to help us easily sort each order and pay efficiently. The service and food is seriously on par here, love it.",

The service staff offered a muffin upon our arrival, which was warm,moist, and very pleasing, but deterred us from ordering it again with our meal (the muffin is offered with every meal choice). The drinks were served in plastic cups that reminded me of those my mother used in the 70s. The food was delivered warm and filled the plate. The seasoned country potatoes were well cooked and plentiful. Our server was communicative and attentive. They offer an outside dining area which is not enclosed so nasty pigeons were walking about and patrons with their dogs were seating there also. Definitely has a local following, but nothing overtly special about Egg & I.",

    "text": "So I saw this place on Man VS. Food and I just had to come here when I was in Vegas. This place closed a little early (around 3pm) so make sure you get there before it closes. Eggg-citing! The decor inside is absolutely adorable. There's little dancing eggs everywhere, which was egg-cellent. (excuse the puns please) The people here are really nice and its nice being somewhere in Las Vegas where not everyone there is a tourist.   So I had the eggs florentine which was really good. My motto is the more fattening the better. The hollandaise sauce was creamy, buttery and probably loaded with saturated fat, which is completely fine with me. The eggs were poached just right, where it's firm on the outside but soft inside. The side of potatoes are really good too. This place is a must when visiting Las Vegas!",

I got to say that plate was very good. Well portioned, extra avocado was not a little but a lot;), service was ok. The only thing I dislike was I set outside on the patio and there are some ugly birds that come around to eat what you drop. Kind of a distraction from enjoying my breakfast.. Positive side was it is a lot quieter then inside. Also might not be a good idea if it hot out tho. My visit on the day was just right to sit out.",

Seriously, so good. Now I have to figure out how they made the potatoes so crispy! Definitely will visit on any future Vegas trips. The service was also top-notch.

The banana nut muffin comes with some of the meals, but if it doesn't order it. It comes to you very warm and moist and it was one of the best things I ever ate! I swear you not.   Anyways, enough of the muff fin because the food was good and service excellent. I ordered the stuffed french toast which included scramble eggs & ham stuffed between 2 thick toast. Man of man, it was alot of food cuz I think they used 4 eggs and then u top it off with syrup. They also had the alot of ranch potatoes that came with it. YUMMY!   My friend ordered the chicken fried steak skillet. I tasted some of it and it was delicious. The gravy that came with it was just really tasty. I was hearty and I would order it next time...=)   The service was great with a egg-sign on the table if you wanted a server to come by if you needed anything. You flip it and any of the server who sees it will come to you. NICE!   This was a great place for brunch and I will be back for the banana nut muffin alone!  A much better brunch place that Hash a go go.",

When driving into the strip mall I noticed the abundance of cars and line outside right away. We didn't have to wait too long, about 20 minutes and the staff was friendly, and the coffee was really good.... I don't know what they put in it, but it was waay better than the average coffee.   My boyfriend had the pancakes and they were fluffy and flavorful, I was somewhat disappointed in my artichoke frittata...The feta cheese was overpowering and seemed like an afterthought dumped on top and I ended up scraping most of it off. It was a daily special item, so it wasn't on the main menu. I would definitely go back next time I'm in Vegas and try one of the basic menu items such as pancakes or omelets, all of the other dishes being brought out looked great... they had good intentions with the frittata but it was less than desirable....  ** The banana muffin everyone writes about lived up to its expectations.",

    "text": "I hate to do it, but i need to knock this down just one star. Every time I'm here, while the service is great and friendly, the place is just packed and I find the breakfast to be lackluster, compared to Egg Works.  The seating is pretty crammed, even when you get there early. We're often bumped by servers and patrons as they're making their way to tables.  I also don't love how they *only* have those season-salty potatoes and not fresh hashbrowns. They have them, but only those frozen hashbrown patties. Meh. I like homestyle potatoes, but these really seem like they're dumped out of an Ore-Ida bag.  The last time we went, I asked for my poached eggs well in my eggs benedict and they came back *very* runny both times. I can handle a little runny, but these were like, runny to the point of being almost chilly inside the yolk.  It's a texture thing and it skeeves me. I know I'm not the only one.   They were really great when I sent it back the first time, but the second time, I felt like a total pain in the ass and was embarrassed having to ask them to redo it, even though it wasn't my fault. They were gracious and took it off our bill and the 2nd time they made it, the eggs were cooked well enough. (Yes, we tipped on the full cost of the bill.)   I also am not wild about how they completely drown their eggs benedict in hollandaise to the point you can't even see the bottom and the english muffin gets really soggy.   My boyfriend's blueberry pancakes weren't that awesome either.  Kind of spongey and flavorless.  For the hype this location gets, it wouldn't be my first choice. But I know it's popular and beloved, so if someone else wanted to go, I'd go, but otherwise, I'd recommend one of their other locations.",

Let me tell you that is one good muffin! This place is great for the price. One breakfast was 11. The food is enough to where you can share without having to get any additional items. Although the hash house is equally delicious, the price of this food compared to the hash house I would come back to egg and I before hash house. My only complaint I have is the size of the orange juice for the price. Your better off going to 711 and drinking an orange juice before you go to breakfast.",

The carnivore loves this place for breakfast!!!  The Carnivore had eggs, bacon, hash browns, and pancakes.  This is his preferred restaurant breakfast.  There were no weak points.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, the maple cured bacon was bacony delicious, of course.  Hash browns were in patty form, but tasted lovely, and the pancakes were of the sort that I just plain love.    This is honest food, cooked presumably with grease and butter, and is just plain good.    The menus look like they are styled a bit after a newspaper, which is new and lovely.  This establishment has something The carnivore has never seen before.  Each table has a device on it that shows an egg with a happy face, or an egg with a sad face.  One is yellow, the other is black, and this means that your server can tell at a glance whether you need her for anything.  Every restaurant should employ a similar device.    Amanda was our waitress.  Yes, the Carnivore still uses the words waitress and waiter.  He also will not apologize for this, or stop doing it.  In any case, Any case, Amanda was on point for our whole visit.  All questions were answered promptly, food came out superfast, drinks were topped off without any wait, and she had an infectious smile.  She either loves her job, or should move to Hollywood.  Mrs. Carnivore and I would be delighted to have her wait on is at any establishment.  This level of service is truly rare in today's world.",

The Sundance Special, a veggie omelet with thought behind it, was actually pretty yummy (artichoke, feta, spinach...great flavors), but the potatoes that come with were pretty yucky. Just cubed potatoes that are overly seasoned and taste previously frozen, not that fresh.  The tuna melt was the WORST I'VE HAD IN MY LIFE. SOOOOO BAD! The \"cheese\" looked like a non-melting version of Velveeta. I'm not sure it was real. I had to scrape it off; it was disgusting. Also the tuna salad part was the worst tuna salad ever. It was a mushy, wet, flavorless glob of mayonnaise mess. The Parmesan bread it comes on is super-salty. The matchstick fries it comes with don't taste that fresh and are overly spiced.  I picked the sandwich to pieces, and most pieces remained on my plate. I ate my partner's Sundance Special, because Vegas portion sizes allow for that. The server didn't even bother to ask how our food was, just slapped the check down and didn't comment that I had barely touched my plate.  The flavored coffee (hazelnut) is really gross. Bad idea to order it, but it tastes like the bad idea it is--overly sweet with its sweetness covering up that burnt taste that most diner coffee has.  This is the kind of place that automatically brings straws with water and gives you styrofoam for your leftovers.",

Totally unexpected. Karla was our server and she was friendly and attentive. She really made us feel at home! Karla didn't even blink when I asked for my free banana nut muffin with my Yelp check in. That banana nut muffin! You have to try it. Best I've had.

I think they put at least 1 entire fresh avacado or more inside of it. Im talking stuffed fat with fresh slices of avocado. If you have a love for avocado, you will love this  egg dish. Their banana nut muffins are scrumptious & worth the carbohydrates, fresh, warm& so flavorful. This breakfast was so good, I could seriously enjoy eating here a few times per week.",

We love going to local hole-in-the-wall breakfast places when traveling and this was the best we have ever had. This was due in no small part to the service. Roman is an excellent waiter who can anticipate guests needs. Awesome food did not hurt either! The potatoes are incredible! Looking forward to trying the banana nut muffins.",

Although, he had only been there a week (?) he was very friendly, helpful, and pleasant, all the qualities you would like when trying someplace new!  We visit 3 times a year, and will make the Egg & I, one of our standard stops.  Nice to see a place with no slot machines!",

She didn't was attentive and did not rush us. My boyfriend left his sunglasses at the table and when we went up to pay she brought them right up to him. This place is a must when your in town or looking for great food with a decent price.",

    "text": "Searching for a breakfast joint, we took these reviews to heart and checked out Egg & I.  We were ANYthing but disappointed.  The coffee/toast/butter aroma wafting throughout the restaurant was inviting in itself.  Our terrific server, Lindsey, volunteered I could have a 1/2 order of anything, as I was not up to 4 eggs.  I chose the chili rellenos omelette - PERFECT - and a 1/2 order was more than I could handle!  My husband had the bandit scramble - DELICIOUS.  Loved that a carafe of coffee was left on my table, so I could serve myself when I wanted more.  Loved that the cost was less than a hotel buffet -- and I didn't have to serve myself!  It is now our FAVE.",

Don ordered some sort of potato soup and a tuna salad sandwich. His meal was pretty good, especially the very hearty soup. However, my danish was very floppy and seemed kind of soggy. I could completely fold it taco style because it had no \"crisp\" to it at all (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fs3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com%2Fbphoto%2Fdk70gFzNfCOjgd3aN7N0_w%2Fl.jpg&s=e36cdc7251956cdea66e05a4339450c68a480290cbf4fef255cb9d5736baa4d3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">s3-media2.ak.yelpcdn.com...</a>). I'd normally give this place 4 stars, but I have to dock off a star because of the danish. I would think a danish would be pretty simple. Everywhere I go, they're all the same, but Egg & I managed to make a pretty bad one.",
