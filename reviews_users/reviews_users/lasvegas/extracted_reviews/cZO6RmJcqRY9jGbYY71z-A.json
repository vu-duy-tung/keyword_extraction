This was the first time there, we were a party of 4 and truly enjoyed everything. Mike and Laura are wonderful hosts. The staff was great. You must make this one of your stops when visiting and if you live here at least a once or twice a week. We are definitely coming back.",

The entertainment was a wonderful blast from the past, with super talented musicians and lead singer (sorry, I didn't get everyone's names, but since we will be moving to the area soon, we hope to get to know the whole gang). Chef Michael is a wonderful host, as is his wife, Chef Laura. And, as a special treat, Michael takes the stage croons old standards to our hearts content. You would think the place has been there forever -- the entire staff are as relaxed and lively as they would be if this was truly their mothers' house. Then the food! Oh, my, the food! My husband and I had a delicious lasagna. My cousins shared the awesome Frutti di Mare -- fruit of the sea, indeed. Another cousin enjoyed his Chicken Piccata and his wife said the Chicken Marbella was great. Two days later we went in at lunchtime for a milkshake. But when we got a look at the pizza being served at a neighboring table, we had to have one, too! Made with fresh and delicious ingredients, it goes down as the best pizza we've ever had. Can't wait to go back for more! Oh, and the shake was yummy, too! Don't miss this one folks! Tons of fun and fabulous food.",

My husband and I did not make a reservation (our fault) and walked into the restaurant on a Friday evening.  We entered into a live jazz dinner.  When we saw the tables were full, we slowly started backing towards the door to make our escape.  Laura (the owner) wasn't about to let a customer walk away hungry.  She waived us over and sat us out on the patio with a glass of wine.  She and her husband checked on us several times to make sure we were doing alright.  Once seated, we ordered the small family style portion of the baked rigatoni and the tiramisu.  Our entree could have easily fed 4 people.  Our server, Aunt Doris was very attentive and accommodating.  My Mother's House Italian Restaurant is a wonderful dining experience.  I recommend it for anyone who lives in Las Vegas or is visiting.",

She was knowledgeable, friendly and prompt.  3) Food was great. My wife had a chicken special (Franks Chicken) Wow, zesty spicy and just simply Delicious. I had the lasagna, also great. The finale was the cannoli; I eat this in every Italian restaurant that we visit and theirs was fantastic.   All the above will tell you that we will be regular guests at \"My Mother's House\".",

    "text": "UPDATE: I decided to change my star rating after reading the owner's comments to my review. Clearly, they don't need the business, at least not my business. She takes an interesting approach to customer reviews.  Let me start by saying that this place has the potential to be great. Very old Vegas, goomba kind of environment - not Italian, but rather East Coast American-Italian style. To start with, the owner, who answered the phone, wanted my credit card number to make a reservation. I declined (because I don't want my hand-written credit card number laying around) and I offered to bring him cash to place a reservation. The owner relented and made the reservation. Fifteen minutes later I was off the phone, but this was due to the friendliness of the owner. Always, it seems, the entertainer. I enjoyed the reservation chat once we got past the credit card issue.  Our food was quite good with the salad and garlic bread being excellent. Two of us loved our dishes and the others said theirs were ok. The entertainment is a plus, which might help explain the high prices. We were ok with that, as the entertainment was fun, although it was way too loud. So loud that we had to write our orders on the paper table covering to place it with our server and we could not have conversation until the band took a break.  Now comes the check. Again, prices are high, but we attributed that to a way to help pay for the entertainment - no problem. Soon, the server came back to our table and told us she had to amend our check because she forgot to add the entertainment fee! What? There was no mention of any entertainment fee when I made the reservation, there is no sign posted about this, and there is no info on the website about it. And after being open for a year, you 'forget' to add the entertainment fee. Expressing our dismay to the server went no where so we paid the bill and left.  To the owner, I hope that seemingly arbitrary, unannounced and surprising entertainment fee, as well as the extra loud music continues to work for you. For us, we won't be back. Regardless of how good the food might be or how fun the entertainment might be, the prices are too high considering the added entertainment fee and the music is way too loud.",

What I enjoyed about this restaurant is that it brought back memories of the old days of vintage Vegas. The host Michael Leonetti, who also does a fine job on those Loui Prima songs, greets all his guest. But that's not all, his recipes for his grandmother to his own are super good. Chef Michael cooks with his heart and the people love it. thanks for a great evening of Italian cuisine, great ambiance and entertainment.",

    "text": "Went here to celebrate the life of a friend who had passed and what a great experience!!  Upon arrival you could tell this place stood out. The decor and the greeting by the owner and his wife were unmatched in any dining experience I have had in Las Vegas. The live band was setting up and the place was getting busy around 5:30 pm.   After being seated we got to chat with the owner (who also serves as a stand up comedian/singer/greeter/waiter/etc). His wife was just as great and they as well as all the servers were spectacular. We started with a complementary antipasto and garlic bread. My wife and daughter ordered the house Cab, my Dad a beer, and his wife a moscato and away we went.  Upon hearing of the specialties from the owner I was set on the Frutti De Mar. It was huge--like 3 people to finish huge and leftovers. Mussels, clams, jumbo shrimp, and a lb of spaghetti in a rich gravy. Delish  My Dad and his wife had the ribeye. Marinated for 5 days and you could cut it with a butter knife.   My wife got the chicken marsala and loved it.   Food was all top notch, they brought cannolis home for dessert, i was too stuffed.   We were a party of 6 and a 14 month old. The atmosphere was fun. There was dancing, singing, laughs, and even our granddaughter had a blast which is not always the case. The lighting and music kept her entertained as it did for us.    Do yourself a favor and check this place out!!",

Meatballs were perfect.  With that also came Rigatoni bolognese and eggplant Parm all for under $40. We also ordered the Shrimp Cocktail and Lasagna (there were no bites left). Last but not least the owner Chef Mike was gracious and one of the best hosts you can ask for. I mentioned I heard the pizza was great. He told the kitchen to make a bunch of pies and brought it out for the whole restaurant. I did forget to mention he SINGS. And boy is he good.  What's even better his band was phenomenal.  They played all the Italian songs I grew up on.  End of this story is that I will be a regular.",

Aunt Cheryl was our server for the evening and she was delightful! Mike made sure to come say hi to us at our table. He informed us of the specials which we decided to order. Chicken Neapolitan with fried zucchini and a side of pasta. Delish! So tender the bone just fell out. My daughter ordered the orange roughy with a lemon caper sauce I believe was created in heaven. My mom had the linguine and meatballs. Another delish dish!  For dessert we had the one with cream puffs and the other, the limoncello (forgive me I forgot the names) But holy moly!... Incredible! The entire time we were enjoying these delightful morsels, we were being entertained by Mike and his band. Such talent and charisma! A glimpse of old Vegas lounges. So happy my daughter was able to experience it! Just before we were leaving, there was a large party that was also departing. I had flashbacks of my childhood being at my grandparents house when the whole family was there. They were all standing around having different conversations as they were saying their goodbyes. Truly a blessing to witness.",

I read reviews beforehand saying that once you walk in you feel like part of the family, and it was True! Cheryl was our waitress and was the sweetest woman. The owner came over and shook our hand and introduced himself. The salad was so simple but extremely delicious. I had the chicken piccata and it was excellent, my boyfriend had the lasagna and it was wonderful as well. They also give you generous pours of wine. They had a band there playing old rat pack songs and it seemed like a party in there and I loved it. At one point all the waiters started dancing with guests. It was a great experience. My boyfriend and I agreed that that's going to be our date night place! The only criticism I'd have was that at points it was a little too loud, we waited quite a bit for our food since it was so busy (although the entertainment kept us occupied), and the bread they give seemed old. Definitely going back though!",

Upon pulling up in the parking lot we noticed a man in a nice suit standing outside of the restaurant and we immediately thought we were under-dressed wearing a button up shirt with jeans but as we got closer the man welcomed us and introduced himself as Chef Michael (the owner) and escorted us in.  Once we were seated, the charismatic Chef Michael took the time to explain the different special offerings he had for the guests and made suggestions.  He informed the waitress of our desires and went off to mingle among the other guests.  We also were able to let ourselves off the hook as far as dress code as the diners were mostly casually dressed  The inside of the restaurant was cozy and we felt at ease.  There was a piano player offering music for extra ambiance and then came along a person with a snare drum to set up..then a base player and hey, all of a sudden you had a 60's cocktail lounge setting going and soon thereafter, Chef Michael gets up and asks if he can sing a song...I mean, it's his place, so sure - why not?  My wife and I were surprised on how fantastic he performed the song not only with a great voice but a ton of energy as he sang a song from My Fair Lady...  Now, I must say, my wife and I were the youngest in the place at this time of day (6:00 pmish) and despite being the youngins of the crowd, we were probably having the most fun out of everyone there!  It felt like you were at a place the Rat Pack would have hung out in.  The food was great as well with large portions and I blame Chef Michael for that second batch of garlic bread he had brought to us for not being able to finish my meal.  Overall, this place was the most enjoyable eating experience I have had in years.  I totally loved it and will be back!",

As we all know, these are sensitive times. A comment like that is never ok, especially in a workplace environment and the service industry! I was completely shocked!

I had lasagna (I always rate an Italian restaurant based on their Lasagna) and it didn't disappoint! Best lasagna ever! Thank you to everyone in the restaurant that made this an unforgettable evening!",

We were seated promptly upon arrival in a large U-shaped table, and was overwhelmed by all the visual stimulation from Christmas decorations/lights to a grand piano to an oversized rat pack wall art. Chef Mike greeted us and made us feel at home with his humor and hospitality. He was very comfortable in interacting with the kids in our party. He even offered a recliner/rocker to my youngest daughter who had just woken up from a nap. He was constantly engaged with the whole room cracking jokes and even sang part of a song or two. We ordered family style with several dishes to share including seafood combination with red and white sauce. I found the clams to be my favorite shellfish in this dish. I also recommend the chicken ala Sinatra which was also juicy and tasty. I also decided to try their Italian beer -'peroni! Crisp and refreshing. Their desserts were definitely a must try. The tiramisu was light and creamy, and their lemon dessert in a flute was absolutely refreshing and yummy. I would go back even just for their desserts. Our whole group had a great memorable dinner thanks to chef mike and his great staff. Hope to see you again chef mike!",

    "text": "OMG this place is awesome and I already have plans to come back! Went to dinner on a Wednesday night with my boss. From reading the reviews, I was nervous that this place may be inappropriate for a party of 2 since the food was family style- I was also nervous about the noise level since some previous reviewers commented on it being too loud.  I can tell you, I am SO glad I picked this place for my boss and I. We came in around 6:20pm during the first set and we were seated. There were breaks in between sets where you can converse with each other/the waiter/entertainers. During the set, all you will want to do is watch. Trust me- you can see the passion in the musicians eyes. It's just such a great experience that you rarely get nowadays. Immerse yourself in it. Anyone into music, good soul, excellent jazz, a lil swing, should come here and check it out.   Now the food-- again, I was nervous that this place wouldn't be appropriate for 2 due to large portion size-- however my boss and I shared a small family plate and it was exactly the amount of food I'd want (with a lil to take home- and trust me, you WILL want to take a little back home)! Portions are large but the small shareable platters are perfect for a party of 2-so don't let a small party or a date night detour you from this place! The food is spectacular- which I kind of expected from reading previous reviews. I have no clue what the reviews re: food being salty is about. I've had good Italian, bad Italian, and meh Italian- this is good Italian. I believe we stayed till about 8:45-9. This was a bit longer than I thought I'd be staying but we were having a good time listening to the entertainment. There were parties/people that left earlier between sets, so it is not mandated that you stay- however your table is reserved for the night. Noise level- I was literally sitting right in front and yes, it was loud, but not \"this sucks\" it's so loud. It's a \"this is so cool, these guys are legit performers\" loud. If you are coming here - come on and come for the experience!  To the people who complained about the entertainment fee... really?! I thought the fee was too low and put more money in the tip jar. Btw - There is no pressure to tip the entertainers. I believe I read a review saying that if you sat in the front, you felt like you had to tip... Well- I sat front and center and felt odd tipping when I did lol. You actually have to go out of your way and walk to the front, up to the stage, to tip the entertainers- so to anyone who may feel like you will be pressured to tip the entertainment-- fear not, though you really should cause the entertainment fee is too low. I'm guessing it's that low because anyone who hasn't gone there would be scared to even try it if the entertainment fee was more- who knows. Maybe it's because it's kinda a bit of a trek to get to?   Tip: it's in a sort of shopping plaza and my GPS sure had me going some weird way getting to the place (lots of side streets/residential)--however getting back home was super easy so maybe it was my gps.",

I'm Italian so I think I have a very good pallet for discerning excellent Italian food. This was five star all the way. The atmosphere was fun and I smiled so much my cheeks hurt when I left the place. There is no place else like it in town!

It is probably the best live show (Mike is a hell of a singer) and dinner I have ever had and I've been to Italy and Sicily over 20 times.  It's not cheap, but considering the great show (the band is awesome) and the food, it's a bargain.  It was our first visit but we will return.  Laura is one of the sweetest ladies I've had the pleasure of meeting here in Vegas and there are some sweet ladies here.  She meets you at the door and you are instantly treated as family.  They do not turn tables so you're invited to eat, drink and enjoy all evening.  If you're ever in Las Vegas do yourself a favor and get a reservation and treat yourself.  Laura, you and Mike are fantastic!  See you soon.",

I saw a commercial for this place and immediately checked yelp for info. All of the rave reviews were spot on. I was pretty lucky and got a reservation for the next night. This place fills up fast so make your reservations well in advance.  The owners came by several times to talk and check on us. They were super friendly and really make you feel like you're part of the family. They made suggestions and asked our opinion. They really work hard to make your visit special.  The family sized portions are huge. We ordered a small baked ziti and it probably could have fed 4 of us. My husband had the linguini with clams and loved it. All of the desserts looked fabulous! We all shared a tiramisu, St. Anthony's Cuppa and a lemoncello and all 3 were amazing.  If you're looking for an entertaining evening with good food be sure to check this place out. We will definitely be back again soon.",

The owners are very nice and honest, the live music is entertaining and of course the food was awesome! My son ate for free because all kids under 12 are free. Everything about the place was just fantastic! We ordered their signature dish which was the right choice! The portion was so much we had left overs for the next two days! If you're looking for a great restaurant with amazing food and make you feel at home, this place is perfect for you!",

    "text": "Wow! This place is incredible!  As you walk up, you are immediately greeted by Laura and we walked in and our table was waiting for us.  Definitely make reservations as it was full when we were there. This is part of what made it special.  It feels like you are at an event like a birthday or wedding.  You really do feel like you are with a big extended family.  The decoration helped really take you there, it just fit so well.  Cheryl, our waitress for the evening, came by and introduced herself and gave us a rundown of how things work.  She was so cool, she came and talked with us awhile later after the food service had slowed down.  Again, it felt like you were with family and talking to Aunt Cheryl.  This is not just a dinner out, this is an experience and event.  Then the food! It is the real deal, the bolognese sauce is incredible!  We had the ravioli with meatballs and sausages and couldn't have been more impressed with how great it was.  Then there is the entertainment, Chef Michael and the band blew the roof off the joint!!! There were other entertainers that were there and came up and sang as well and each one was so good.  During breaks Chef Michael came and greeted everyone there and we really felt welcome and like we belonged.  There was the $5 entertainment charge and our thought was that we got the best deal on entertainment you can get.  Overall, for what we got and the experience we had we felt this was an incredible value.  Even the day after we're talking about how we can't wait to get back!",

The only time My Wife and I had Italian food this good was when we traveled through out Italy for a month. The spaghetti and meatballs from this place is definitely a slice from Italy. Very fresh , not greasy, and all around perfect.  We also enjoyed the mussels linguine, clams with angel hair, and the Frutti di Mar. The atmosphere also resembles that of a mom and pops restaurant in some of the smaller cities we went to in Italy. Customer service is the best you can get. It definitely feels as if you are at your Mothers house :) I highly recommend this place !",

MMH is an experience. A great live band with the owner chef Mike singing from time to time all while entertaining every table without being annoying (That's not easy to do) Chef Mike brings the kids candy and makes them feel like family. The garlic bread is the star of the show as well as the Sausage and Meatballs. I am half Italian American and my family has long roots in Las Vegas and South Philly so we know food and entertainment. MMH is a gem and probably the best spot for a dinner party with friends. The lady who greets you at the door is warm and friendly, and as far as having to leave a Credit Card to make a reservation is news to me. We have been 3 times all by reservation and never had to leave a card. Keep up the great work and don't change a thing. Salute!!!",

A friend that lives in Sun City told me this was a new Italian restaurant that opened a short time ago and that it was open for late lunch. Since all good Italian restaurants that I know are only open for dinner, I decided to try this place.  I ordered Chicken Parmigiana and was told it was only available in family size. My wife wanted to order something else, but since the Chicken Parmigiana was only available family style she decided to order it too.I ordered wine and the owner Mike bragged about how much wine they served in each glass. The chicken was served over pasta. The chicken was overcooked and the sauce (gravy) tasted like it was right out of a can. It's hard to believe this place has a high rating in Yelp. It must be rated by the owners relatives. Makes me wonder how good Yelp ratings are. My assessment is that this is a Classe inferiore establishment. Check the decorations outside........",

We had the house made raviolis for two. The flavor was wonderful, and the portions were generous. ( the garlic bread never ran out! )The Service was friendly and timely, no long wait for food or beverages. Chef Michael came by to say hello and make sure we had everything we needed. We had a great time, in fact we came back about a week later with our adult daughter and her boyfriend, who happens to be gluten intolerant. They had pasta that was gluten free and he loved it too!

He and his wife Chef Laura made us feel very at home since the moment we walked in the door. They go from table to table greeting everyone and making everyone feel so welcome. Chef Mike also makes sure every kid gets ice cream! And he gave little pea a huge lollipop when he came over to say hello. This is, by far, one of the friendliest places we have ever been to. Food and service are amazing! Our server Dylan was so great! Get you some real Italian food and come here to enjoy a family-style meal one day! Children are welcome and very well loved.

    "text": "After seeing the reviews on Yelp, I was dying to try this place. It's not horribly far from home and I was craving some real Italian food.  The location is in the middle of a strip mall in Sun City, Summerlin, and it was packed, surprisingly so for a Wednesday night. I was glad we had reservations, otherwise we might easily have had to wait a long time for a table.   The restaurant isn't huge but you wouldn't know it from the noise level. The conversational din was pretty high, but could easily be attributed to the high age range of the customers. I've been told that hearing aids aren't a perfect solution for most people and I think the average age of the clientele was north of 70.  Our waitress, Angie, was a doll! She brought lots of free goodies to our table, which everyone gets - antipasto, garlic bread slices, bread sticks, and salad. None were epic but all were good.   Hubby ordered the steak, which comes with the claim that they don't give you a steak knife because it can be cut with a butter knife - and they weren't lying. I had a taste and it was tender and tasty, definitely an Italian marinade that's worth having. I wouldn't want that for every steak but yes, it was pretty damn good. Hubby did a good job finishing up every last bite of that steak and it was a good size.  I had to try their lasagna, made from the owner's mother's recipe. Initially, I liked it pretty well but then I realized that I wasn't a big fan of the lasagna itself but liked the outer parts where I could include the marinara from the serving plate. The actual lasagna wasn't made with marinara included and was a bit too heavy on ricotta for my tastes. If you love ricotta, you're going to love this lasagna! The portion was huge, and the leftovers were enough for two more meals at home.  We didn't order any of the family meals, which are served on platters. Any one of those would have given me leftovers for a week!  Now, about the band and the singing... There's good and bad about it. The good is that they're all dang good, and the owner has a great singing voice! You have to like the RatPack vibe or you'll hate this, but it would be hard not to be converted by them. The bad was the volume. It was so loud, I felt like my brain was melting. I have sensitive hearing but I felt like I might need hearing aids myself after sitting through a 3-singer session. The other 2 singers were good, one is a younger crooner who is the son of their amazing guitarist and the other was a visitor who they said is retired from a career at the Met. She sang all her songs in French, so I had no idea what she was singing.  They have their live music sessions on Wednesday, Friday, and Saturday. As much as I liked them, my hearing insists that our next visit is likely to be on a Tuesday or Thursday .   Overall, the food is pretty good, the staff is amazing, the music is loud but good, and we'll be returning before long.  Oh, and the owner (and Chef) is absolutely adorable and might stay and chat for a while, and expect a hug from him when you're leaving. He's definitely a people person and is charming as heck.",

So I watched the video of Chef Mike and told the wife that Chef Mike was very compassionate about Italian food and we should give it a try. After we walked in it was no doubt very welcoming. We sat down and our server took our beverage order. Chef Mike came over and asked if we ever been to his restaurant and after saying no he went over his recommendation. No doubt he makes you feel like family.... Now onto to the food it was out of this world!!!! All I can say is you will be back. The portions and the quality are no doubt the best I've had in a very long time....... Thank you Chef Mike and we ill be back with our four boys!!!!!",

My husband and I took our 17 year old son and his girlfriend because we Heard this place was amazing. My son was so impressed with the family pried,culture, and amazing food that it brought a tear to his eye. They treat you like family and gave us an experience that we will never forget!! This is definitely a place that we will continue to go to for years to come.",

    "text": "As a vacationer and first time visit to this establishment, I was not impressed. After reading the reviews their was several warnings and I thought not to judge to soon and give this place a try. The previous reviews held True and thus my experience fell short. However if you are an elderly couple or family visiting you may have a wonderful time.  But as a younger couple the interaction of the chef is off putting and found to be to obnoxious.  In response to Laura, you don't have to explain or defend your establishment. I only post reviews to give my opinion that way other yelp user can have the best experience! However I fell short on my review by not talking up your food.   So in a not so apologetic way... the food is supreme but bring a big appetite or make sure to have enough people to share the meal.  Each meal/ food option can feed 2-3. So you will get your money's worth.  And at the end of the meal you get a fancy gift bag with a few cookies.  And if your lucky enough the piano keys will be played loud enough to make you feel like Sinatra is right in your ear.",

From the moment we walked in, we felt like we were part of the family. There was live music (piano player) and the food was incredible. We started with the garlic bread and marinara, to die for! Then we had shrimp scampi and lasagna (best we've ever had!). Since it was our first time, they brought us a cannoli, again, simply delicious! We are already talking about when we will be back and who we have to bring with us. This spot is an absolute gem!!!",

We stumbled upon this place on Yelp, made reservations for myself, my daughter and the grandkids, ages 1, 11, 14 and 17. When you go inside the place is light blue decor and white table cloths. There is Sinatra memorabilia all over the walls, like at your grandma's house! The staff are amazing and accommodating and get you taken care of right away. Everything is family style, which is really fitting because when you are there, YOU ARE FAMILY! So, we are there hanging out when Chef Mike, the owner comes to the table and sees all the kids. He picks up his phone saying,'ring ring' and calls Santa, and he is told to give the kids suckers! Not little Lollypops, but giant woven suckers like at Disneyland! He talks to the kids and goes about his business. His wife comes to the table,she runs the floor, and asked to hold the 1 year old and takes him for a walk around the restaurant (she said all her kids are grown up and don't visit, lol) He loved her! Next, Kim takes our order, by the way, she is super awesome! So while we are sitting there Chef Mike goes up on this little stage with full band and starts singing. Now, he was a singer in Vegas way back in the day and has the most amazing stories he tells before each song, Franky, Deano, Sammy, he knew them all. AMAZING performance while you are eating, the best!!!!! The food is amazing AND you get a lot of it. Pasta, salad, meatballs, eggplant Parm, ravioli, and more! And you get a show. And not just a show, you become part of it. Mike took the girls on stage and they became his back up singers and dancers. Listen, kids these days have different tastes in music, but when the band played they felt the nostalgia and went nuts for it. My 17 year old granddaughter said, 'that's it, I'm. Moving in here and Chef Mike is now my new Grandfather', lol. Myself and the kids highly recommend you and your family come and spend an evening with Chef Mike, his wife and the whole staff. It will be an evening you will talk about for years. Thanks, Chef Mike!!!!",

It was awesome.   FOOD  The food tasted homemade and was homemade. While I've tasted better Italian food, the fact that this food was made from what was clearly a family recipe made it have that heartwarming home cooked feel.   SERVICE The owner, Chef Mike was ridiculously entertaining. He spent a large amount of time sharing great stories w/ the guests and was hilarious. The staff and owners were very generous as they handed out oversized lollipops to the children in the restaurant and went above and beyond.   PRICE The food was about $10-$15 higher per dish then typical mom and pop Italian restaurants, but holy smokes do you get the quantity to match the cost. The portions are GIGANTIC!  OVERALL This was a great experience for all of us and was great to visit.   COMING BACK? We WILL be back with our family and kiddos. :-)",

Everything is so fresh and you would swear you are eating at home. From the garlic bread with bolognese as an appetizer to the dessert at the end everything was delicious. The desserts are amazing I couldn't decide so we had two! My first time here but I found my new favorite Italian restaurant. Mike is the real deal, old school Vegas with the class and charm of another time. They make you feel at home as soon as you walk in. I live close but I would drive across town to eat here, it is just that good.",

He let us know that he makes the food himself fresh daily and lovingly went over all the ingredients he puts into it. Right after he was done talking with us he jumped on stage and sang us a song! It was great! Will definitely be back!",

    "text": "We arrived 45 min before closing and they still pleasantly sat us. Our waiter Uncle Sal was very attentive and kind. We started out with the crab cake appetizer. The crab cakes were delightful! They were not heavy with breading, nor greasy and they had the perfect amount of stuffing.Chef Mike and his wife were always making the rounds of their guests and checking in to make sure everything was to their satisfactory. They are very sweet, pleasant people. We asked Chef Mike what he recommended and he said the brisket. His words exactly,\"Brisket so tender, you could cut it with a spoon. You cant cut it with a spoon, then you dont pay for it.\" Well he got us curious, so my boyfriend ordered the brisket. I asked him what another favorite dish was and he said the orange roughy. Never had it and I'm always up to try new foods so I ordered it. They brought out homemade garlic bread sticks with their own bolognese sauce.  Yum! Chunks of garlic and great herb seasonings. The salad was perfectly tossed with the right amount of dressing. Very light and refreshing! Our main courses came out a little while after and wow! Chef Mike was right that brisket was so tender you could cut it with a spoon! It was heavenly!! The orange roughy(white fish) was so succulent and light. The sauce it came with was very good. It was the perfect pair! Shortly after we ordered dessert. Mama's homemade rice pudding. It was soooooo good! I was already stuffed from the main course but I wasn't going to let that go to waste so I found some way to eat all of it. Hahaha. No regrets! Chef Mike was so kind to even put it on the house for us. Overall the atmosphere the experience was fun and friendly. I recommend this place to anyone looking to get away from the Italian chain restaurant because this place makes you feel like your family and they truly care for there guests. Thank you again!!",

Would rate zero stars if I could. The owners response to my review shows how much they care about how bad the service was. The waiter spilled the sauce on my husband's silverware when he bought out the bread. Removed the silverware and never replaced it. They got his order wrong so the food came out late. We had to refill our own wine and ask for refills of soda. The staff didn't even notice that two of us barely touched the horrible fish. They need to advertise as a lounge act that serves food",

    "text": "What a nice surprise! Truly a hidden gem. I saw the owners on Fox 5 yesterday morning at the same time my husband was asking me where I wanted to go for my birthday. Sounded good, so he and I, along with another couple who are our dear friends, made the trek from Henderson. Excellent food, I guarantee the biggest portions you have ever had! Often you get a big plate but the food is \"meh\". Not here! Everyone starts out with a  beautiful salad, French service style. Simple, fresh and delicious. I had some of the best lasagne ever, one friend had the Fettuccine Alfredo. Excellent. Hubby ordered linguine and meatballs, good but the sauce had cooked a little too long, a little brown, slightly bitter. Which was odd because the lasagne sauce was a similar sauce but sweet and good. They certainly don't stint on the cheese - eveything was abondanza! Deserts all excellent, we each order a different one and then pass them around. Lemoncello dessert was \"roll your eyes back in your head\" great, excellent FRESH cheesecake, great canneloni and very good creme puff slathered in chocolate. We went on a Friday, and - who knew - it becomes a supperclub and show starring the chef who used to tour with the old Vegas greats, on Wed, Fri & Saturday. A 5-man live band - and the show just came with dinner. It was like going to a Italian wedding, lots of interactive stuff, especially showcasing any kids in the audience, making it memorable for everyone!  No more expensive than the Olive Garden, and if you haven't picked up on it yet: worlds apart! Great place to bring out of town guests or for a special occasion.  GO! You will LOVE it!",

The service was great and Chef Mike and our waitress treated us amazing all evening. The food was even better than the service and nothing disappointed. Very authentic and fresh. Every thing that was upsold met expectations and a few family style meals worked perfect for our party of 6. We got the Sea Food Special and the Ravioli and both were great.

The restaurant has a strolling violinist and guitar player who play for requests. We were seated next to a large group of young adults touring in a Shakespeare theater group. When the strolling musicians visited their table everyone sang and their voices were glorious. They sang the theme song from Cats in therefore part harmony. What a nice piece of free entertainment.  Our food was delicious, orange roughy piccata for me and brisket for my husband.  During dessert the musicians were at the table across from us on the other side and a woman at the table began singing an operetta piece. Voice of an angel. Wow. Ended the evening with complimentary tiramasu. Perfect, delicious, exciting date night for two.",

I had contacted Chefs Laura and Mike and spoken with Cheryl a couple of months in advance to set the date, and they were all so helpful and accommodating. From having the cake delivered and delivering the little flower arrangements beforehand to deciding what to do for the menu--they were all very patient and professional. There were twenty of us on the afternoon of the graduation, and we all enjoyed the our time there and happily left with our leftovers.

The ambiance and the lounge music is entertaining and quirky, and the staff was really nice. However we sat down at 6 PM and our food did not come until 8 PM. My husband and I split a plate of gnocchi. The portions were generous but the quality was absolutely appalling for the prices (we paid 47 dollars for 1 split plate, 2 sodas, and the 5 dollar entertainment fee). The tomato sauce they use for almost every dish is salty, poorly seasoned, and reminded us of canned chili. The meatballs and sausage were poorly seasoned and heavily overcooked. It was the worst meal I have ever had in a restaurant in my entire life, without exaggeration. I'm so sorry to disparage any family owned restaurant, I really hope things improve.",

The owners and staff were incredibly friendly and made you feel like you were at a friends/family's house for dinner. The food was beautifully presented and full of flavor. The music added an excellent vibe to the place and the decorations were fantastic ( ranging from throwback pictures, different colored lights dancing on the ceiling, record albums, and other classic memorabilia. ) Looking forward to coming back and bringing family and friends.",

The owner greeted us at the door and was interactive and entertaining (we got an acoustic guitar serenade) throughout our meal. The salad was delicious, the garlic bread - more like a toast - was garlicky and buttery and the house made ravioli and meatballs and sausage, made with house made marinara was exquisite with perfectly cooked pasta. Wine is priced well. The owner had us try the limoncello, so tart and creamy, and the coconut gelato, to die for! We will ask for double malt next time in our malteds ( we like to be hit hard with malt), but will definitely be back. Looking forward to the nights they have live music... the owner plays the drums! Excellent meal!!",

We sampled a few dishes as they have Family Style as well as per order but the per order is enough for 2 to share.... Meatballs melt in your mouth the sauce is scrumptious.  You will have left overs so ask for a little extra sauce to take home.  Live music Wednesdays, Fridays, and Saturdays.  Great home feel and atmosphere.",

From the menu to all the decor, he had a story for everything. We were there for the first time to celebrate my mother in laws birthday and once we told him that he brought a guitar, started singing and then came the complimentary cake. I tried a lot of different food and it was all so good. The pizza appetizer was delicious and probably the best pizza I've had. The desserts were really good too! I'm definitely gonna come back next time when they have the band there! They even gave us some to go cookies once they packed up all our leftovers. Also I forgot to mention the portions are huge so you should always have some leftovers.",

The food appears to be fairly authentic Italian fare. The lasagna and Chicken Marsala were excellent and are a fan favorite. The garlic bread will have you wanting to follow its roots to Italy- it's that tasty. The antipasto was also a nice touch that is included with your meal. There is piano music playing on the nights that the enchanting throwback to the oldies show isn't playing. The owner and staff provide exceptional service and will have you smiling from ear to ear before you leave. This place is a go in my book but don't forget to make reservations.",

    "text": "It is embarrassing to find a new restaurant, give it a rave review, tell friends how great it is, take them there, and then have a bad experience.   I was not going to update this review, thinking we would just not go back. But last night I met up with another Yelper, an Elite who said she couldn't wait to go after reading my review. After telling her about our last experience, she urged me to write an update. And then when I came here to do that and read the one written by Simone R., the feelings it evoked were so similar that I know it's the right thing to do.  We went last Saturday, wanting to see the show that Chef Michael had talked up incessantly during our first visit. For starts, we could not have a conversation with our friends, because it was so loud. If that were the only bit of unpleasantness, I wouldn't be giving this place two stars. But then we ordered our food.  First came the salad, along with the garlic bread. The salad was so incredibly salty that it was inedible. Our waitress, Aunt Cheryl or Cousin Cheryl (it's all family, and confusing), said she'd re-do it and make it herself. It was better.  Our friend ordered Mussels Marinara. The presentation was spectacular at first - served in a huge, covered ceramic tureen. But she had a hard time getting the contents out, and even after that, getting the mussels out of their shell, because she wasn't provided with a seafood fork. She got one after asking for it, but still struggled with getting the food onto the plate.  I ordered Chicken Marsala, which I had a tiny taste of when my husband had it last time. Too bad I didn't have a bigger taste. First, it seemed that the overly thick sauce was thickened by a huge amount of pieces of batter. But even worse, it, too, was so salty that I couldn't eat it. When I sent it back, the only thing that was different was that the cook had simply omitted the capers. Yes, I know that capers are salty. But I'm perfectly capable of distinguishing the salty capers from the rest, and it still was oversalted.  None of this would be enough for me to downgrade this place to two stars, nor is one bad experience. But the coup de grace was the attitude, and that's where Simone's review becomes relevant: When we first arrived we were received like royalty. But at the end of our sorry dinner, Michael, making the rounds in his incessantly loud and self-promotional way, came over to ask how things were. I told him about the salad, the mussels, and the fact that my meal had to be sent back. His response? A mere shrug, and he walked away without apology. He couldn't care less, and wasn't going to do a thing about it. He didn't offer to comp the dish, my glass of wine, or even offer a dessert for the table to share. Not a damn thing. I am reminded of a certain politician who is your best friend when you are praising him, but you're worthless if you're not. It's not about free food. It's about feeling like a valued customer, and we felt we were treated badly.  IMO, this is not the way to treat a customer who has not only given you an outstanding review, but who has returned with other people in tow. The lack of caring speaks volumes. When it's good, it's good. When it's not, you're SOL. The emperor has no clothes, and this is not a way to run a business. We will not be going back.",

    "text": "Went to My Mother's House a couple of weeks ago for the first time after hearing about the place and wanted to write a review. Making reservations was fairly easy, but that was the BEST part of the whole experience. If I could give a negative star rating, I would. As soon as we arrived and placed our drink order for 2 waters and 2 diet cokes, we were made to feel like we shouldn't be there if we are not drinking alcohol and watched the wait staff annouce to we assume the owner, that we were not drinking alchohol.  Our table was ignored and the time period in between a salad and entree was close to an hour and 10 minutes. When the entrees arrived and the calimari was a blackish/gray color and tasted pretty much as bad as it looked, I got up and walked out. Every entree looked and tasted like it was prepared with a microwave.  The brisket had packaged brown gravy smothered all over the meat that tasted like it had been cooked, frozen, thawed and reheated.  The chicken parm had the oddest taste to it that any of us could even explain. Nobody in our party of 4 ate their entrees, paid $130.00 for absolutely nothing, but we were just Happy to get out of there. 2 of the 4 people in the party were ill and could not leave their bathroom the next morning and had to stay home all day.  The atmosphere was so loud that you could not have a conversation with the person on the side of you, and we were on the opposite side of the room to where the entertainment was happening.  No earthly idea where the positive reviews come from, but I would never recommend this place to anyone and can see this showing up on aLas Vegas Dirty Dining episode in the near future.",

Best Italian dinner!!  Chef Michael is all-in-one.  He brings his talent of making delectable food, originally under the tutelage of his grandmother, to your table.  His lovely wife, Chef Laura, gives him full-support, love, admiration, and I would bet a good bit of tolerance.  Our server, Kris, was on point, guiding us through each course, able to answer every question with a smile on her face and genuine care for our dining pleasure.  Everyone was considered family.   The first course was Chef Michael's personality.  He loves what he creates.  He lives and breathes it.  He gets excited just telling you about what he is going to serve you.  It started with crunchy delicious garlic bread, flavorful salad, and the best ever melt-in-your-mouth meatballs.   We decided to share two entrees this evening.  We had Blue Crab from Maryland with Angel Hair pasta and Marinara sauce, as well as Sauteed Orange Roughy with Zucchini. Both excellent!  We went with a Pinot Noir from Oregon, \"Evolution\", even though we were eating seafood.  It was actually a good choice.  Not heavy and complimented the meal.  Soft warm cloths with a slice of lemon were provided for clean-up.  Needed it as we made a delicious mess. (We were provided plastic crab bibs to protect our clothing.  How did they know we would be so messy?) Dessert?  Of course!  We chose two of the three special desserts to share for the evening.  Limoncello - so fresh.  If you've ever had the martini, this is it frozen.  I'm not going to share it next time.  And the cream puffs with St. Anthony's chocolate.  The \"to die for\" dessert.  There are 3 little cream puffs topped with chocolate from Italy that is nothing like the over- sweetened, candy-like, chocolate we're used to here in the U.S.  So yummy. You may even get a serenade by Chef Michael!  If the weather is right, sit outside.  Beautiful setting.  \"Back in the day\" tunes play while you're lost in the harmony of flavors you're experiencing.  Live entertainment is provided on Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  I hear it's spectacular.  We've already got reservations for Friday night.  Looking forward to it!",

Chef Mike and his band were playing. We were greeted at the door with a very sweet woman who I believe is the owner's wife. She was very personable. Chef Mike was also very personable, walking around talking to every table. We ordered the frutti de mare and gnocchi and the portions were huge! All and all, we had such a great time. The music was awesome. We will definitely be back. It might be our regular spot.",

Our servers were so friendly and efficient and Chef Mike himself described all the dishes and made amazing recommendations. He was such a wonderful host and made our entire group feel right at home. He even sang a couple songs and entertained the entire room all night not just with his songs but his stories too. The food was simply delicious. We ordered family style which worked out great because we got to try a little bit of everything from their pizza, ravioli, their incredible seafood dish, the chicken piccata, and every single dessert on their menu which included the best tiramisu I've ever had, a wonderfully refreshing lemon dessert and a delicious cup with cream puffs covered in imported chocolate from Rome. We had a great time here and highly recommend them for a delicious and fun family dinner!",

The people of Sun City are a lucky bunch to have Mike and Laura in their neighborhood.  Oh, sorry, Mike and Laura are the owners, and the Chefs, oh and did I mention musicians too? By the end of the evening we nicknamed the gentleman Triple Threat.  First and foremost, be smart and make a reservation or there's a good chance you won't be dining here. It's a small and intimate place, with live music and some of the best Italian food I've had in a long time. They make a dish or two of each item per night and when they're out, that's that! They are so specific about their recipes and how things are prepared, I could see the passion as they spoke about it. Chef Mike explained in depth how the picatta is cooked, and how the chicken never actually touches the pan because he layers it in artichokes. By the way, it was one of the best picattas I've ever tasted. As soon as you sit down you're greeted with a complimentary house anti-pasta that's very delicious. And DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT skip dessert!  We didn't feel rushed out at all, and they welcomed us to stay and enjoy the live band.  I will without a doubt be returning as often as possible to this restaurant. The food is to die for and prices are more than reasonable. They truly make you feel like family, and considering the name, I think that's the point.",

I cannot say enough wonderful things about our experience- it is one we will all cherish for a long time.  A festive interior filled with Italian accoutrements and Christmas lights greeted us, along with a warm greeting from Chef Mike himself.  Wonderful servers kept our water glasses filled and our wine glasses fresh (with that nice Italian pour!) as we prepared for the FEAST!  A 7-course meal left us all so full yet it was so delicious none of us could stop eating.  Italian wedding soup, antipasto salad, amazing pastas, melt-in-your-mouth meatballs and Italian sausage... and then the traditional turkey and other Thanksgiving items...but let's not forget the delicious spumoni and to-die-for cannoli.  Wow.  I cannot wait to return to Vegas so I can enjoy another meal at My Mother's House, enjoy more delightful background piano music, hear tales from Chef Mike, and make this place part of our family's tradition.

From the warm greeting by Chef Mike to the complimentary garlic bread and meatballs we knew we were in for a special evening. Based on Mikes recommendation we started with the caprese salad and pizza as appetizers and both were superb. We then had frutti de mare which was a fabulous seafood dish along with chicken Sinatra and delicious gnocchi with home made meatballs and home made Italian sausage. Even though we were stuffed we had to try the deserts which were a deliciously refreshing limoncella, outstanding tiramisu, and a unique Roman chocolate cream puff like dish. Throughout the whole meal Mike continuously checked in with us to make sure we were enjoying ourselves and regaled us with stories about his family which were the inspiration fo opening his restaurant. This was truly a memorable evening and the next time we are in Summerlin we will definitely be back.",

    "text": "My wife and I went to \"My Mother's House\" for our date night because Yelp told us of a new restaurant. The restaurant used to be Mykonos and unfortunately they had to close down due to an accident in the family. Greek is hard to find in this town and Italian is a dime a dozen,  so you need to be good. With that being said, I tried to give this place a fair rating.  The staff was nice and courteous as well as the wife of the owner... It is a bit pricey for what it is seeing I can't imagine the rent would be more expensive as the prior restaurant,  so why would pasta dishes be so expensive? Approx 3-4 items were not available that night due to numerous excuses, but that could be overlooked too seeing it's a new restaurant. The owner was a bit over the top though and not in a good way. If I want a wise guys style restaurant, I'll go to Capo's. The owner/head chef apparently doesn't cook, but prepares all day and then comes back in the evening to schmooze all the retirees from Sun City. He tries too hard to be Vinny Bag O Donuts vs. Arty Buco. Seeing an owner come out and greet tables from the kitchen is more appropriate than trying to be an extra from Goodfellas. I've been to Naples Italy several times and this isn't what the food is like there.",

Just went back and I can definitely say My Mother's House is the must place to go to in Summerlin and I'll go as far and say in Las Vegas.  Any shortcomings that we saw last year are gone -- the food is top notch- large portions  - wait staff attentive and friendly- wine pours are double what you would expect- and the entertainment is Vegas Strip quality.  Michael is a natural on the floor greeting patrons, as well when he's on stage.  You need to go to see for yourself, but not too often please -- we want to make we can get reservations, ourselves, at least twice a month.",

    "text": "Pinch me, I must be dreaming! We wanted Italian food for dinner (it was National Spaghetti Day - 4 Jan) and we're pleasantly amazed by this restaurant. We were cordially  greeted by a few gents in matching striped red and gold shirts while walking up to the entrance, and thought nothing of it. Upon walking it, we were struck with surprise by how packed the restaurant was. My girlfriend and I thought that we surely weren't getting a table (we should have made reservations), but we TOTALLY lucked out and got a table because someone had cancelled. Laura (owner) sat us at \"The Family Table\" and made us feel just like family with her charming smile and personality.   Cousin Kris (our sever) was very attentive and professional. We ordered one of each of the specials, orange roughy with picatta sauce and \"The Spoon\" brisket with roast vegetables. Next thing you know... those guys in matching shirts from the parking lot took the stage! We had no idea there was entertainment!!! Chef Michael (owner) crooned us as his band accompanied with flair and pizzazz.   The roast was just as described, tender enough to slice with a soup spoon! The gravy that came with the roast was rich & delicious and the vegetables were cooked to perfection. The orange roughy with picatta was superb and light. While we were both completely full, we couldn't leave without dessert. Initially we were going to share ice cream and ended up also getting the St Anthony's Coppa (cream puffs smothered in semi sweet chocolate) and the Lemoncello.   We can't say enough about how magical the evening was. Michael, Laura and the rest of the staff really made us feel like we were family. The food was incredible and the music was classy and uplifting.",

    "text": "A lovely family-friendly gem with great Italian food, great service and entertainment!   We dined here as a large group a few days after Christmas and had a great experience.  The staff was super friendly to our young son and very tolerant of him running around which we very much appreciated.   We decided to order family style since there was a bunch of us and I think that was the right call. Everyone got salad which was basic but well-dressed, garlic bread and then the big family style platters came out. The food was made with care and all tasted good. No dish in particular sticks out in my mind as being over the top delicious but it was definitely good enough for me to say I'll come back and recommend this place to others. The Frutti Di Mare platter was quite impressive looking. Awesome for pics and bragging. Again food was tasty and served hot.   The Chef/owner stopped over and told us about his family and restaurant history and we appreciated the background info. We   My only gripe is that they sat us at a table that was far too small for the number of people we had. Our chairs were packed in so tight that we couldn't move and had to climb out of our chairs. We did have a reservation that we booked over a week in advance so I was a little disappointed to be so packed in. If we knew it would be that tight, we would have been happier split at 2 tables. So if you do book for a larger party of 12+, keep that in mind or perhaps arrive a few minutes early to ensure you are happy with the table.   Overall it was a good experience and we will return. Likely on a show night and with a smaller group so we can enjoy the entertainment they provide and try some different dishes.  Locals- go here for a date night or special occasion!   Tourists- if you have a rental car, it's a bit of drive from the Strip but worth it to see a cool neighborhood Vegas gem. There's also good views of the city from this area of town.",

The band was fantastic. Music from the 40's, 50's, and 60's/Ratpack/old Vegas lounge style.   I have never been to a place where you have the table all night. They don't turn the tables! So the atmosphere is relaxed and you are with the same people while you are there- more like you are at a show than a restaurant.  The wait staff were really hustling and attentive.   I got chicken marsala and it was the best I've ever had. And I've had it a lot! Husband got meatballs he said were delicious. All the meals came with salads and overall it was very inexpensive. I can't wait to bring my husbands Italian mother-she's going to love it!  Make sure to tip the band!",

    "text": "I was intrigued by the title of this restaurant so on a beautiful January evening a friend of mine dropped in. They are located in Summerlin Sun City. They are kind of hidden away but they do standout in the strip mall they are located in.  Little did I know that reservations are always expected but we arrived early enough that they were able to seat us. We were welcomed warmly and because the evening was so comfortable, we ate outside with a nice heat lamp to take the slight chill off. We had the whole patio to ourselves which was lovely!  Our server was super friendly, attentive and upbeat. She explained all we needed to know about the menu and the offered dishes. I wish I could remember her name but it escapes me! I think it is unique that each employee is referred to as a cousin, aunt, uncle etc. Makes you feel like they are one big happy family. It is encouraged to order family style and even though there were only two of us, we decided the try the chicken parmigiana with their house salad. We also enjoyed some antipasto which my friend just loved. We both ordered a glass of wine and their serving portions are very generous.  Our salads arrived promptly and when I took my first bite, all I could taste was salt. I thought at first maybe it was just the dressing but then I took another bite and again very salty. I am a little sensitive to salt as I don't add additional salt to my food. I asked my friend if she tasted it and she said yes and we both were wondering why so much salt in a salad. The greens themselves were fresh and tasty but the intense salt just ruined the salad for me. Next up was the Chicken Parmigiana. The presentation of the dish was really pretty and  the portions were very abundant! We both dove in and for me this dish was just ok. The chicken was a little on the dry side but the pasta and sauce were tasty. We both filled up quickly so I gave the leftovers to my friend to take home.  What makes this little place so fun is the evening entertainment. The owner Michael sings and makes everyone feel right at home. He made sure he came over to our table and introduced himself and was very personable which my friend and I appreciated. Although we were sitting outside, we could still hear the band and Michael. Everyone inside was having a great time.  I may bring my Mom back to this place as I think she would really appreciate the good time that this place brings along with the fantastic service!",

We found this place on Yelp and thought it sounded amazing.   -The environment would get this place 5 stars if that was all we wanted. The owners and staff were all amazing! Greeted right away, great music, fun atmosphere, friendly, interaction staff/owners had with the kids.. fun! Not your typical restaurant in a good way.  I wasn't aware of the entertainment fees for Friday's until we sat down and looked at menu- $5/ each guest- which wasn't bad given the entertainment, but I hadn't budgeted that piece when I estimated the cost of dinner/tip that night.   -The problem I had was I wasn't prepared for the cost or mediocre food. The dinners were huge- each individual plate could feed 2-3 of us which explains the $20-30 price per plate. No kids menu. They did have a family meal option, but we couldn't all agree on one item. The food wasn't bad, but it wasn't worth the cost. For four of us - me drinking water and no deserts (although they gave the kids suckers and a scoop of ice cream for free -looked like they did that for all the kids in the place) we spent over $200, but came home and ate our grocery store food. That could just be our personal taste though.   Overall, we had a good night and I wasn't angry nor did I want to complain when we left. But I don't think we'd pick it as somewhere we'd go again.",

They let us come in anyway and it was the best Italian we've ever had. I forgot what his name was but he was like an Italian grandpa. He was the SWEETEST man. He gave my daughter a sucker and told her that Santa was watching her through their cameras to make sure she ate ALL her food.

    "text": "We (my fiance and I) have visited this restaurant a total of four times now, even though it's only been open for a few months.   Our first visit was fantastic, with the exception they were out of soda. We ordered the polenta with meatballs and sausage and were assured by our server that it was more than enough to share. Sure enough, it was a huge portion size with plenty of meatballs and sausage, probably 3-4 of each. We were very pleased with the dish, and had enough for each of us to have leftovers the next day.  Chef Michael was out on the floor, greeting guests. We understand it's his restaurant and he wants his guests to feel welcome, but he was much too loud in such a small restaurant and overly boisterous. He yelled across the restaurant at other customers for trying to leave without saying goodbye. We left after eating and tried not to draw his attention to us, lest we be yelled at also.   Our second visit, about a week and a half later, was pretty disappointing. They were out of soda, the type of pasta I wanted, and when we asked for more of the bread, the waitress took our bread basket with two half eaten end pieces, put two more end pieces in it, and brought the same basket back. We almost left a Yelp review (would have been 3 stars), but decided against it, since it was a pretty new restaurant, they still have the kinks to work out.   Our third visit, we decided to order take out and split the polenta. When we got home, there was only one meatball and one sausage in the entire dish. For $19, we definitely expected more than one meatball and one sausage, especially when it's supposed to be family style with enough to share, and we had ordered this exact same dish before, and as previously stated, there were plenty of meatballs and sausage.   I was very upset and I called the restaurant. Laura, one of the owners, I believe, was very apologetic and understanding about the situation. She talked to the chef about it, and I overheard him defending it, saying he is always careful about only putting one meatball in every order. The menu explicitly says 'meatballS' plural, and when I order from an Italian restaurant, I definitely expect more than one meatball in my order, especially for $19.  Again, Laura was very nice about it, and insisted that she wanted to make the situation right, and to just let her know it was us the next time we order and she will do what she can to make us happy. She acted appropriately as an owner/manager, and if I was reviewing just her service, she definitely deserves 5 stars.   Since she had promised to make it right, two days later we called in another order of the polenta to split. Fifteen minutes later, I arrive at the restaurant by myself, which is packed as it is a Saturday night. I introduce myself to Laura, who remembers me. She gets Michael to come over, and tells me to tell him know what the problem was. As I begin to explain that I was a frequent customer and had been upset by our last visit, he straight up WALKS AWAY as I'm speaking to him. Literally mid-sentence, he just turns and walks out the patio door to the outdoor seating area, no excuses, no apologies. Laura looked at me and said, \"I guess we lost his attention.\"   It was indescribably rude and frankly, unacceptable for an employee, much less an owner. After he finished whatever he rudely walked off to do, he came back. When I explained how I had only received one meatball and sausage in our last order he said 'that's how it is!'    I replied that not only have we ordered it before and had multiple meatballs and sausages, the menu states the dish comes with multiple meatballs, and how can they justify a $19 entree that only has 2 pieces of meat that is supposed to be shared family style.  He cut me off and loudly announced that he'd give me 2 meatballs, scratch that, 3! And then walked off again. He didn't offer any apologies or consolation whatsoever, for either the dish or walking away in the middle of a conversation.   Apparently, Chef Michael is more interested in singing in the band and greeting old friends than he is in actually running a restaurant.   I hate leaving negative reviews, but you can tell by the length of this review that I was very very unhappy with our experiences at this restaurant. Again, the food is generally good, the service is hit or miss, but it is absolutely unacceptable for a business owner to walk away from someone trying to express their dissatisfaction with their meal, especially when they gave you the opportunity to fix it.   We will not be returning to this restaurant.",

The server lady was super nice and helpful and the owner/chef Mike came by the table several time to check and chat with us on this busy day. He even did a little entertainment for the kids plus free ice cream.. What more can we ask for...!   We have 4 adults and two kids and we ordered 3 family meals. The portions is huge... Plenty leftover for next  a couple days.  They even give us a little gift bag filled with Italian cookies to take home... I have nothing but greatest experience of this place.  And so happy it's just 5mis away from my house.  Highly recommend for summerlin friends if you just want a nice kids friendly place to hang out with live music .",

    "text": "This place is simply amazing. THE BEST BAKED ZITI I HAVE EVER HAD, bar none.  Mike and Laura are wonderful. Very affable and charming. The live music was a bit loud inside, but great listening from the patio. The decor was wonderful as well. I loved that they spent the time to liven up the patio.   Food: The antipasto provided was good. The carrots and celery were standouts, but the bell pepper and olives were a miss with up (although we are not whole olive people).  Now, about that garlic bread .... simply amazing, especially fresh out the oven. So garlicky. So good.   We got an order of the French Onion Soup, and it was really good. I've really only had better in France. Seriously. It was that good.  The salad was simple, but delicious. Just lettuce and onion with a house dressing. A great palate cleanser.  Mains: We shared a small family style baked ziti. IT WAS AMAZING. I visited a Italian grandmother in the Bronx one time, and she made me my first baked ziti. That was delicious. This was better. I would fill a bathtub with this ziti and dive in.  Amber got an order of chicken picatta. It was tasty. It was not my favorite, but she loved it. I can't wait to try the chicken marsala on my next visit. It is served with a side of linguini, with a marinara style sauce. The marinara is very tasty, but next time I would get the pasta dry so that I could add it to the picatta sauce.  For desert, we had chocolate shakes. They were great. They also give you little cookies on your way out, but our server gave us them early so we could eat them with the shakes. It was a great touch.  Service: Service was amazing. Except for one time having to ask a busser to get some water, our waitress was on it. She gave great recommendations, and Amber and I had a great wine with dinner for like the first time ever. She even had the kitchen delay our mains when we forgot to order our appetizer.  Honestly, other then the music volume (which was perfectly solved by us sitting on the patio), my only complaint of any kind was that Mike had a decent splash of cologne on. I think I am a bit sensitive to it, so it may have felt more then it really was, but I was glad I was outside :-)  Would give 10/10 if I could. I highly recommend this place! If you are on the fence about trying it, at the very least, go meet Mike and Laura. You will feel so welcome, you will sit down and try it.",

It started with the Smiles that we got when we walked in and didn't stop until we left. They started us with a Garlic Bread and a salad that was a perfect size for 4. We ordered the Fruitti de mare and a Shrimp Scampi also.  When we received the Fruitti da mare I thought that we were feeding the other table besides us to as it was truly enough for 6 to 8 People. The Shrimp Scampi was enough for 2 so with everything on the table we could have fed 10. The food could not have been any better as we all looked at each other and smiled. Linda and I are both Italian and we thought that the sauce was just like Moms. omg it was Great. Angela Loved her Shrimp Scampi and we also had a MALBEC wine which was very good too. For desert there was a Chocolate sensation that included a chocolate from Rome Italy & Teramisu & a Cheese cake that was delightful and Laura brought over a Lemacella Parfeit that was to die for. With Mike & Laura both stopping by the table to check on us and make sure that all was ok it made for a Great Evening of Food & a few laughs too. If you are in the Summerlin area and crave Italian this is a must STOP for dinner. Believe me we have found a Gem here in Vegas NW area and will be back numerous times I'm sure. Say hi to Mike & Laura and you will be glad you stopped there. When we left we were given each an Italian Cookie and WOW were they good. Remember it is  \"MY MOTHERS HOUSE\" in Summerlin. Buona Mangiata",

Family style food portions were very large and attractive, but unfortunately so salty that most of the flavors were lost in the Aunt Carmela's dish we ordered. Particularly liked the rigatoni and peppers. Live entertainment was talented and fun but MUCH too LOUD! This small restaurant does not need so much amplification of the band. Volume was so excessive that conversation was all but impossible during the music sets. Rounded off the evening with a nice slice of cheesecake and coffee. Will probably return, but will definitely try to get a table much farther away from the band!",

We were greeted by one of the owners who was beyond sweet and makes you feel like she has known you your entire life. Being from New York ourselves we just loved the whole feel of the place. Tables were close together but that made our experience nice because we enjoy meeting new people, the football game was on and we all started chatting. The food was amazing, the other owner (I'm sorry I'm terrible at remembering names) suggested something and I went for it. It was blue crab from Maryland and unlike most places they did not hold back on the seafood! There was so much I had to take it home! It was delicious and I enjoyed trying something I've never had before. Our waiter Dylan was very down to earth, friendly and professional. We will be requesting him next time we come.. which will be soon and often! I can't wait to bring my friend who is in love with frank sinatra she will absolutely love the experience. Telling everyone I know about this place! See you soon!",

He offered us any table in the restaurant and made us feel welcomed as he very enthusiastically described some of the specials not listed in the menu. If you're looking for a real Italian experience, look no further. The place is decked out in family heirlooms and memorbilia from the Rat Pack and former stars such as Sinatra and Louis Armstrong and they have a pianist playing all the classics.         The food is second to none. Right away you're introduced to garlic bread and Chef Mike's grandmother's bolognese sauce which is one of the best I've had and at the right price (complimentary!) We then had the braciole which my girlfriend said was the best Italian dish she's ever had. It was accompanied with a neopolitan salad which includes some kind of lemon-vinaigrette (my guess) that definitely impressed. Next was the Aunt Carmela. We had a large to share between 4 of us. Oh. My! Besides the fact that it looks and tastes like everything you dream of from an authentic Italian spot, there was so much that we ended up leaving with two separate to go boxes, and out of our half, my girlfriend and I both had lunch plans for the next day. We finished with St. Anthony's coppola which included chocolate from Rome and a homemade whipped cream which was to die for. Throughout the meal I had a glass of Chianti and a dessert wine which I forget the name of. Both of which were fantastic wines and complimented the meal perfectly.       I will definitely be coming back and be sure to bring all of my family and friends. Look no further, grab a reservation, and enjoy everything Chef Mike and his wife have to offer. You will not regret. Salute!",

The garlic bread was good dipping into the sauce that they provided I was totally shocked when I saw my order 1/2 order of fruit De Mer. It was huge massive amount of food I think I counted at least five large Blue Crabs.. muscles, clams, and shrimp linguine that came with it was very well cooked the flavor of the sauce is garlicky and goes great with the French bread I barely can get through 20% of the food before I gave up and ask for a to-go tray. I gave me the grade for the restaurant based on five criterias: price, quality,quantity, service, and taste( not necessarily in that order) this one for my first visit is a 5. The fruit De Mer was delicious and huge. Will be back to try other food on the menu.",

Turns out, the main performer was the owner mike and the person who greeted us at the door was his wife, Laura, the other owner. Also, on top of an AMAZING experience the food was to die for! Would definitely come back, especially because mike told us we should have our wedding there lol. Make sure you make a reservation though!",

We were welcomed with a smile and the owner sat us. It was like being at grandma's house. Chef Mike came to welcome us. Did I mention we were the only ones there and it was our 1st time. He told us his food specials and I was convinced to get the crab over linguine. We also ordered the lasagna and the meatballs over linguine. The dishes came with a simple refreshing salad and we got a complimentary garlic bread with their bolognese sauce. The dishes were big enough to share and they were so good, so flavorful and absolutely amazingly delicious. Delicious,  amazing and so so so so so flippin good!!!! The desserts were out of this world. We had the tiramisu, limoncello, and cheese cake with a bourbon peach sauce. Did I mention, amazingly delicious. Now, we were told since we took the last table we can stay for the entertainment and so we did. Wow, wow, wow!!! Chef Mike can cook, bake and sing. We danced and sang and had just a great time, all the while the waitress was checking up on us and refilling our water. My mom even danced with Mike's wife. We had such a great time!!",

    "text": "We had pre theater reservations at 5 PM and the restaurant was not very busy upon arrival. We were greeted by owners Laura and later by chef Michael as he made the rounds of the tables. The restaurant was sold out on this night with most of the people coming in at 6 PM to enjoy the music. The dining room is not very large and the tables are close together. The decor is very nice with many photos of entertainers and celebrities. The men's room even has some beautiful photos of Marilyn Monroe.  Dinner began with a complementary bread basket of garlic bread and  bowl of marinara sauce. A very hearty starter that can fill you up. Next was a family style salad of romaine lettuce dressed with lemon, olive oil, and onions. This was a very refreshing arrangement.  Our entrees were: The Chicken Piccata is made with sherry wine, lemon butter, Kalamata olives and artichoke hearts. The chicken was tender and the wine lemon mix was perfect. The amount of artichokes are way more than my wife prefers.   The amount of artichokes in the dish was overwhelming. When our server Franco came to check on us my wife commented on the amount of artichokes and he immediately suggested that dish be replaced. In a few minutes a replacement dish the Sinatra Chicken appeared and was well received.  Chicken Sinatra is a 12 oz breaded cutlet cooked to perfection. The breast was tender and juicy. The chicken was totally covered with roasted red peppers and served with zucchini. This is a great entree not found in many restaurants.   The dinner portions are large and include salad and pasta. We passed on the pasta since we were going to the theater.  This restaurant reminded me of the supper clubs back in the day in Chicago. Not conversation friendly while the band is playing but definitely a fun evening  The band was a four piece group plus the singer chef Michael. The band was well  versed in the old standards.  Overall, this is a fun place to enjoy good food and great entertainment. Our server Franco was on point helping us with the menu and checking on our satisfaction. We will be back  to experience dessert and the music.   We hope the locals continue to support this family owned an operated restaurant in Sun City Summerlin.",

Didn't try the Alfredo sauce but how hard is it to make a good sauce. Apparently harder than it is. I told the owner we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and they never even acknowledged it during the evening. If you're not going to acknowledge it or send out a special dessert then why ask if we are celebrating something special?? Won't be returning.",

    "text": "My friend and I stopped by here on a whim. We were in the mood for Italian but wanted to try something new, so I did a quick google search and found \"My Mothers...\" and it was really close to my house! Exited, we arrive around 630 pm. We had a little trouble finding the place because the GPS kept rerouting and it's tucked into a small shopping area.      Once we opened the door we were a little startled because we didn't expect the atmosphere, at first we thought we had come under dressed. We were approached by our hostess, one of the owners and they placed us at a table by the kitchen door. The place itself is rather small and they already had a good amount of people dining. There were two stages and lots of instruments. Which, we learned upon opening our menu its a $5 charge per person to be on the nights they perform, which of course was a night we were there. A Tuesday no less.     We decided to stay despite the extra $10 charge just to sit there and looking over a pricey menu. We were approached by the owner, a differnt one from before, and he was nice and shook our hands, which I enjoy because it definitely gives you a more welcomed feeling.     We ended up skipping a much wanted appetizer because the prices of the dinners were just so steep. Although we did enjoy their free basket of garlic bread and their dipping sauce, it was fabulous. We wanted more but you'd be charged.      My friend ended up ordered their Chicken Sinatra, $26.00. She also opted to have her side of pasta with alfredo sauce and not marinara. I decided on their Shrimp Scampi, $29.00.     While waiting for our food to arrive, the owner who had so nicely introduced himself to us earlier jumped on the mike and started singing. Which was fine.... it was just crazy loud. Being such a small space and loud music like that made it a little uncomfortable.     Our salad arrived first which I enjoyed but my friend did not because she got a big chunk of raw onion so it was off putting to her. Our food then arrived, in good time and our waitress was also very polite which I feel is nice to point out. I liked mine, the scampi, I just wish there was more body to the both it was sitting in. It was hard to get any of the actual scampi sauce on my linguine. My friend liked the chicken but did not enjoy their alfredo at all. I pointed out that it's prepared differently, with egg, and it's just not something she's used to. So I wouldn't say it was bad, it just wasn't her cup of tea if you will.      Overall, I'm not opposed to coming back but they won't be my first choice. The prices were just too high with quality of food and just a very loud restaurant.",

    "text": "I cannot express how amazing our experience was with this place.  First, let me just say that I was shocked to talk to Chef Mike when I called in to make my reservation. I had worked as a waitress for chain restaurants before, and I was very impressed that the owner of the restaurant was answering phones and taking reservations.   My husband and I are parents of three children. One is 6 months, one is 3 years, and one is 9. Going out to eat when we can is a real treat for us, but it's extraordinarily challenging. Naturally, I felt nervous about going into the restaurant with our energizer bunnies, but as soon as we walked in we were greeted and welcomed like we were family. They completely enchanted our children, even the baby, and there was not a single comment made about technology by either of the kids the whole two hours at dinner (the fact that we were able to eat out anywhere for two hours, still amazes me!). Our kids absolutely fell in love with the atmosphere and the staff, and because they enjoyed themselves so much, my husband and I were really able to enjoy ourselves too. It was a dinner I know the kids would reminisce about for years to come. It was truly magical!  The food is INCREDIBLE. Everything tasted home made, and even my picky eaters ate their weight in fine Italian Cuisine. We all left almost too full and with left overs to spare.   The entertainment and the music really tops the cake though! We were singing, dancing, and laughing the whole evening. The music is sensational and the atmosphere is fun and vibrant. If you are in the need of a pick me up, this is the place to go. It's not possible to be here and be down in the dumps.   We had to leave sooner than we would have liked because of the baby needing to get home to bed, but the two older kids spent the whole car ride home talking about how much fun they had and asking us when we could go back again. Aside from Lou's Diner, we have never been to a restaurant that had this kind of positive impact on our family. It was a marvelous experience and we are so very thankful!   I highly recommend this place to everyone I know",

Every single person in the staff greeted us and they were so welcoming.  That is the most important thing to me- but Chef Mike went completely above and beyond.  We had our 2 small daughters at the table. He came over, interacted with them, gave them treats, and made sure they were having the best time.    The band played so well.  We were moving to every song. In between appetizers and our dinner, we got up to dance.  It was seriously a blast.    Dinner was delicious.  We ordered crab cakes for the appetizer.  Linguine and Clams, sauteed shrimp, brisket, & gnocchi. Perfection.  Dessert here is out of this world.  We ordered ice cream for the kids,  tiramisu, and a cannoli.  Chef Mike had us try a few more desserts.  I wish he didn't, because I'm now addicted.  The limoncello is the best I ever had.    We will definitely be returning- not just for the food, but for the experience.  This is a place unlike any other in Las Vegas.",

From the moment I walked in the door until I left I felt like I was welcome! The live music was a nice bonus and it wasn't too loud as to be interruptive to table talk. My server, Sal, was by far the best server I have ever encountered but I must mention that the other servers were helpful and super nice as well. I had the most delicious lasagna with wine and I took home lots of lasagna (the serving size was huge)  and a cannoli for later. Go see Chef Mike and the whole gang at My Mother's House, you won't be disappointed!!!",

Hubby has an Italian background and is very picky with the sauce so when he says the sauce was delicious who am I to say he's wrong. We both ordered lasagna, and the portions are large and everything tasted fresh. For dessert we got Tiramisu which was equally as good as our meal. We didn't get to experience the full ambiance as we went when there wasn't any live music but it doesn't change how much we love this place. Laura was a delightful to be around, she was attentive to our wants and made us feel very welcome! If we lived in Vegas we would return! Definitely worth the drive and the price of our meal. Hats off to Laura and the chef!",

The family section of the menu has very generous portions at very reasonable prices and can easily feed 2 or 3 persons. There is a wide variety of Italian dishes and the owner has told us that he adheres to his mother's own recipes. Whatever they are doing, the dishes that we have tried all were excellent in taste and quality of the ingredients.  The lasagne is one of the best that I have ever had anywhere. The chicken parm was very good and had huge amounts of chicken in the dish. The shrimp scampi is not done in a baked style as many other places do, but it has huge prawns over a bed of linguine and it is outstanding.  If you possibly have room for dessert, try the Black Forrest Cake. It isn't your typical German style heavy cake with cherries, etc. It a fairly light cake made with mouse and chocolate shavings and it is wonderful. Not heavy or filling at all.  They only negative that I can relate is that it tends to be a bit on the noisy side. If you want to carry on a conversation with a larger table, it will be a challenge. Past restaurants at this location have failed and we hope that My Mother's is a huge success. If the first couple of weeks are any indication, they are going to be here for a long time. If you are considering going there, DO IT!",

This beautiful little gem has all the things you would want to find here in Las Vegas for great Italian food. We went in with two small toddlers (most places put you in the back to keep the other patrons away from whinny kids but these guys put us right up front and welcomed us with open arms.the kids loved it they treat us like family all the staff waiters waitresses and the entertainment were so fabulous.food is not the only thing that makes a restaurant great it's all about the experience, the staff, the taste, and the the general feel of the place and let me tell you this place is awesome. They have a wonderful old school band that plays music from way back. It's older generation style but makes you still wanna get up and dance!   I believe on the weekends is when they play, we went on a Saturday night and they played until closing time. The owner/operator/chef/singer are the most sincere people you will meet! I had the chefs special, orange roughy a beautiful lemon capered creamy sauce with grilled zucchini and a side of spaghetti with homemade marinara. My daughter had the Julius Caesar, which consisted of soft shell crab, yes flown in for his restaurant, shrimp and a ton of other seafood which was delicious there was so much she could not even eat the entire platter which was huge. When we walked in the owner, came to our table had one of the staff bring the Santa Claus phone for our children, and then they called Santa on the microphone and he told the kids he wanted them to have a special prize. Then the staff brought out to very very large lollipops for each of our children which made them very happy and us as well it's just such a beautiful place. Decor was quaint and just like its name, it felt like your mother's kitchen!! Highly recommend this place!!",

They also take the time to meet and greet you, making you feel like family from the time you walk in to the time you walk out. This is a small joint, very cozy, and kid friendly. Our 8mo old had a great time looking at all the lights and interacring with wait staff.   -The food is delicious, and the portions generous, even the \"individual\" dishes could be shared. We had the lasagna, ravioli, chx romano (bone-in!), and linguine alfredo. My favorites were the lasagna and ravioli. It was my father-in-laws birthday and they served up a complimentary canoli in celebration.   -LIVE MUSIC a few nights per week starting at 6pm. It was so fun and enjoyable for us. It IS loud....so if you don't like loud, dine in on a different night. Michael surprised us by singing a few tunes himself, which was very cool!   5 stars for this restaurant's authenticity, quality food and experience. We will be back!",

The food was fantastic. The service was impeccable. The show was a blast! We danced, we sang, and we had the best night out. We will be repeat customers at this place!!

This is by far the best Italian place i have been to in Las vegas  and believe me ive tried tons, mike and his wife absolutely wonderful people, so down to earth and friendly , engaged with our table , our children,  complimentary ice cream for our kids , c'mon what other place does this, NONE.  Chef mike is amazing and talented. lets talk about the food, amazing homemade and made with love kind  of food, the best ive tasted, caprese salad was on steroids lol,  every other place serves a piece of  mozarella and a tomato(flimsy)  this plate came out decked out , huge, delicious,  I was blown away.  8yrs here and we finally found our spot,  we have been looking for a place that reminds us of back home (queens and Brooklyn) to be exact and this is it. Amazing experience,  thank you.      p.s. anyone giving a 1 star on this place I  can guarantee dont know what True authentic Italian food tastes like, go back to olive garden.",

Maybe we went on an \"off night\" or maybe a different place entirely because I would give 1/2 a star if possible. We were told this is their \"slow season\" so maybe that was it?!?  The garlic bread tasted like it was straight from the frozen aisle at Smith's. The lasagne was $25 a slice so I was expecting something spectacular, large, and/or hearty; it was none of that.. it had 2, MAYBE 3 layers and I don't think there was even meat in it. The chicken piccata was very different from anything else we've ever had with artichokes and Kalamata Olives.   The real kicker was we were charged $5 each for \"entertainment\". Yes, there was a singer there but it's not like we were serenaded or even requested a song from him. (Note: I did see someone posted a photo of a note on their table of a $5 entertainment charge, but there was NOT on on our table or any other table when we went)   So here we are $90 later (we tipped 20% of course because it's not the servers fault); and vowing to never go back.",

My mother's House has officially done that for me. Traveling weekly across the country, this is a marked favorite. Chef Mike and my server, Cheryl provided a five star level of service. I started out with a glass of \"four bears\" Pinot noir. Followed by a serving of the house Neapolitan salad, and a main coarse of lasagna. The portion of lasagna is enough for two. I was check in with consistently by the staff, and chef mike himself when he was not cooking. All this, and I took home some dessert and have lunch for tomorrow. This place is a MUST for visitors looking for homemade Italian food. Until next time....",

Chef Michael met us outside, walked us in, handed us off to Cheryl our server for the evening. Cheryl introduced us to this hidden gem and its menu. Chef Michael came around to introduce the night's specials and give us a introduction to his favorites. Then the real treat began.  This is like a dinner club if the 60s/70s. You make a reservation, you come to eat and be entertained, best of all the table is your's for their evening. They do not turn over tables. You don't need to eat and scram. This was a new feeling, but one I can get accostomed to quickly.  The food! Wowza. The bread is scary good. I had the Maryland Blue crab with white sauce and linguine. My BFF had the slow cooked brisket the was spoon/fork tender.  The music was such a treat and to hear some favorite tunes from a previous era was heartwarming.   I will be going back.   Hint: make reservations. We were lucky as it was summer and it is not their busy season. In winter Cheryl tells us, there is no other way to get in.",

Siciliano an pizza was awesome.  They were able to accommodate halting the pizza to just pepperoni on one side and 1/2 half as iChicken Parmesan was great. Another dish with all meats and eggplant pharm was very good as well.   Make room for dessert.  Apps are big and must try. Will definitely come back with family.  Highly suggest bring a big group to share the big plates.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTELY A MUST TRY!   This is a cute and quaint restaurant hidden in Sun City. My husband & I dined here tonight & we were greeted immediately with smiling faces. Chef Mike sat us at a table for 2 which he jokingly called the \"Love Bird\" table. He immediately introduces himself, gives us a little background on his menu & the recipes. I had the linguine with meatballs. It was amazing. It's not your pasta sauce out of a jar. All ingredients are fresh & full of flavor. The portions are large enough for 2. He boasts about his grandmother's meatball recipe as it was well deserved.   My husband ordered the brisket which was the special tonight and it was excellent. You could cut it with a spoon. It came with a small bowl of pasta and I forgot to mention salad is included too. Salad was light & fresh.   We also ordered a small baked ziti to go for my son and he gave it 2 thumbs up, lol  My husband and I were very full and  had food to take home so we were not going to try any desserts but, Chef Mike treated us to a Lemoncello and it was the best I've ever had. It was actually the perfect dessert to share if you don't have much room in your tummy. It was a light dessert. It had the perfect amount of lemon zest and so creamy.   Franco was our server tonight & he was attentive, friendly, efficient & a very nice guy. Refills happened before we could ask and empty plates didn't sit in front of us for very long. He himself earns 5 stars.   I found the restaurant to feel more like home. I love that there is a Christmas Tree decorating the corner of this restaurant. Chef Mike informed us that his grandmother kept her Christmas Tree up year round. This restaurant feels more like a home. It's very festive as is the outdoor seating.   I can't say enough great things about this Ma & Pa place. I love to see small businesses flourish & I think they're doing everything right.   Oh...They have live music a few nights a week. I can't wait to come back.",

The best part was when chef Mike came to our table with his cool red telephone talking to Santa, my kids loved it! Then he gave them giant lollipops!! The food portions are LARGE!! We tried gnocchi, chicken Marsala and linguine Alfredo. Food was good, lots of sauce!  There is a $5 spilt charge, which is clearly stated on the menu. However next time I would just order a pasta to share! Pasta comes with house salad and chicken comes with salad and side of spaghetti. The garlic bread is to die for. Our server Sal was wonderful.  This was not one of their show days but there was live music with a gentleman playing guitar and singing. He had a great voice, was rocking some good Elton John and Eagles numbers. They charge an entertainment fee of $5 per person and this includes kids. We were charged $20 for 4 of us. I guess this was for the live music? I was under the impression that entertainment fee was only on show days Wednesday, Friday and Saturday.  Tiramisu is one the best, must try. Chef Mike was super sweet and got kids ice cream on the house. Overall, we had a great time.",

You are seated and immediately the warmth of a unique taste bud experience begins. The music from the live band starts, and Chef Michael entertains you like no other polished seasoned professional entertainer! I highly recommend My Mothers House......you will be back and back and back again!!!!!",

The service was second to none, particularly Franco who took care of our table.  The entire staff was attentive to all our needs even under the pressure of a full house. The food was amazing from the House Salad to their home made Tiramisu.   Saturday entertainment was like being at an old school Italian wedding.   Dinner and a show that included Frank Sinatra  That's life, Mel Torme Pennies from Heaven and so on.  I highly recommend the experience.",

Chef Mike met us at the door and enthusiastically greeted us and let us know we were in for a fun night. The band was great and Mike hit the notes.  Uncle Sal serves us and I found out he was from south philly. We had a lot in common. He was an engaging waiter who was attentive.  The food was excellent. Started with garlic bread and along with my spaghetti aioli was a simple but tasty  neopolitan Salad.   If you're looking for a quiet romantic dinner probably not your place but if you love music from a few yesterdays ago with laughs and good Italian food.  Make the trip.   The room is small so make reservations.  Lou and Ava Gardner.",

We sat down and Franco was just so attentive and kind. Then Chef Mike came out and he was fabulous. He had a phone that he brought out as he was taking with Santa for 2 of my kids. They absolutely loved him. He's just so kind. My 9 year old adored him. We found out he played with Sinatra-amazing stories. My 9 year old asked if we could listen to him in the car on Apple Music  be was so excited that he met someone famous. My older daughter came late and he was so nice to make another call to Santa-adorable.  Ok the food-just wow. You have to be the fritters di mare--it's chef mikes signature dish. So amazing. The platter of seafood was gorgeous. My kids enjoyed the chicken parm-said it was the best they've had. Ohhh I can't forget the salad and bread-delicious.  We ordered 3 desserts and all delicious as well-tiramisu, cheesecake and chocolate puff yummmmmm.  We found out he has entertainment...he performs himself, we came on Thursday and he had a great pianist, and one night he has violinists. We decided we definitely need to go on a night he performs-make sure you make a reservation. I think it will make for an amazing date night. Great food, wine and entertainment. Can't beat it. Old Vegas feel.  LOVE IT!!",

Chef Uncle Mike and his staff are so welcoming you feel like your part of the family.   We went on a Thursday so we got to experience a calm environment with the piano in the background and occasionally Chef Mike sang a song and specifically one directed towards my daughter's about being \"daddy's little girls\"...almost cried.   For food we ordered the Aunt Carmela which is one of the family style dishes. They described the dish to serve 3_4 but 8 could have easily consumed this dish with no leftovers. A Bolognese sauce topped linguine, Italian sausage, meatballs and a delicious eggplant parmesan. So delicious! We also had the Alfredo which had sweetness to the sauce, maybe made with a little ricotta cheese. Also good.   We had to have dessert since we were celebrating a birthday, so we ordered the tiramisu and the St. Anthony. Both were do rich and creamy definitely the best I've had for both desserts. They were so nice they even gave the kids complimentary ice cream, which was a good quality.   My family is already looking forward to our next visit. We plan on going on a Wednesday or Friday because they have entertainment that includes a rat pack style of music, dialogue and comedy that will be really fun.   Enjoy!!",

    "text": "Ordered the chicken parm ziti family style size small for my husband and I. We both had a good sized bowl with leftovers for a third adult. Great portion sizes for the price, I believe it was $32. Considering 1 dish at Olive Garden is a good $15, it's a great deal. We had it for dinner and can both eat it for lunch the next day too. The sauce was chunky, tasted very authentic and homemade. Nothing like the jarred sauces. Oh and they made it with lots and lots and lots of garlic. Even big chunks. That's neither good nor bad, just depends entirely on your taste. So be aware if you don't like garlic, maybe ask if they can do light garlic or something. I thought it was good but I can definitely see if some can see it as overwhelming.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the cheesecake is a bit steep. Granted, you CAN taste the quality of it and again, the homemade-ness of it, but it's just 1 average sized plain slice for $7. I was confused and saw some pictures on here that others posted of blueberry cheesecake so I thought it came with a fruit topping of some sort. My mistake, I should have asked beforehand. But still, $7 for a piece of cheesecake with no toppings or flavors is...eh, not worth it.   Great place, will be back and recommend!",

I'm not necessarily opposed to that, provided the card information is stored securely, which it's not. But moving on...we arrived for our 8:00 reservation and the live music was in full swing. Now, this place is tiny; maybe a dozen tables. If a mouse sneezed in one corner, you could hear it clear across the place. The music was over-the-top loud. Our party of four couldn't hold a conversation. We couldn't hear the server; she couldn't hear us. Not only did they play loudly, the saxophonist played into a mic! There are actually speakers 10 feet from the band. Thankfully, they stopped just after our salad course. Aside from the way-too-loud music, the decor is absolutely tacky. It doesn't read so much \"delightfully collected by grandma over the years\" as it does \"we're opening a restaurant tomorrow so let's run around to all the HomeGoods stores we can and buy any clearance item that loosely belongs in a restaurant.\" And then add in the laser light show from a nightclub...like, really?  Moving along...I was ready to overlook all of this for the authentic, home-cooked food they touted. The garlic bread was OK...crunchy and flavorful, with a slightly-too-greasy marinara sauce. Everything went downhill from there. The salad they serve with everything is sad. Just under-dressed lettuce.   And then the entrees came. Chicken marsala...the mushrooms were good. But the breading on the chicken was raw and mushy. Kind of like the cook dipped it but forgot to cook it before putting it on the plate. I asked the server if it was always prepared that way. She went to get 'Chef' Mike, who explained that is exactly how it is supposed to be prepared. In his arrogant way, he attempted to defend his misguided cooking process before finally offering something else. However, having tasted the other three entrees on the table, it was clear that my entree wasn't the problem, but that bad food is the only menu option here. (He did take it off the check, though I always prefer good food over crappy free food.) After all, he informed us that he's a 'very rich man' and isn't going to worry about a chicken.  The meatballs, a staple in Italian joint, had the consistency of wet, very fine mashed together sawdust. Weirdest texture ever for a meatball. Little flavor, too. The gnocchi was undercooked and gummy. And the cheese on the lasagna was rubbery, but not in a good ooey-gooey cheese way. All served with the same greasy, flavorless red sauce. None of us ate more than a third of our meals.  If this place were on Restaurant Impossible or Kitchen Nightmares, you can just tell that the owner would think everyone else is crazy and he's the only right one. Now, I don't like giving negative reviews to independent places, but there's just nothing good about this place. I sincerely hope they had an off night, but there's no way I'm going to put myself through another night at My Mother's Place to find out.  (And I'm 100% sure the owner will respond to this review with something like \"you could have just left.\")",

We have been looking for many years in Las Vegas for a place  that \"has\" it. We found it here.   The food is as close to what we know as authentic Italian cuisine from Phillie and New York. If you close your eyes you hear the rat pack and Sinatra singing to their family.   That's Mikey!! We brought our professional musician son and his girlfriend visiting from Portland and they put my son, Daniel Rossi on drum set, and he played with his band and killed it!  Everyone was having such a great evening. They brought down the house! My Mother's House is definitely our favorite place  and you need to make it yours because they deserve the support of our community to continue to make this a five star restaurant.  Great food, fun, and atmosphere. Love this place!!!",

    "text": "Came here last night for my parents 50th anniversary. We were a party of 10 (6 adults, 4 kids) in Vegas for vacation and was looking for an Italian restaurant to celebrate at.  Found My Mother's House on Yelp and had a great experience all around, from the reservations, to the entertainment (yes there is a $5 per person charge but it's written on the menu and our singer was great), to the greeting by Chef Mike, and great customer service by Aunt Cheryl and the staff.  We ordered family style and ordered about 7 dishes plus 3 desserts.  The absolute highlights were the Frutti di mare (in white sauce), linguine and clams, and the shrimp scampi.  The simple house salad was also amazing...even the non salad eaters at our table were asking for more.  For the desserts, the limoncello and Saint Anthony's culpa are not to be missed.  The only downside was the desserts aren't large enough to be shared and we didn't order enough for our table as the kids were all digging in even after the scoops of ice cream from Chef Mike! Overall was a great night!",

Well I have been more satisfied with a Marie Callenders microwave pasta dinner I bought in a rush at a gas station for $3...this food is mediocre at best and the cost is ABSOLUTELY insane for the lack of flavor and smallish portions. Also not too thrilled to find out the owner has a spotty past (i.e. felony rape conviction!?) I will never set foot in this craphole again and ESPECIALLY would not recommend your patronage if you are a female or have female children. It is a disgrace that he is even allowed to hold a business license no less be inter-mingling with women in a place of business....go waste your money at Olive Garden, at least their sub-par food is worth the price.",

    "text": "Pros: GREAT FOOD!! ... GREAT SERVICE!! ... GREAT ATMOSPHERE!!! Love the garlic bread and tomato dip appetizer!!!! Nice sized portions. Our food server (Angelina?) was terrific, enthusiastic, and cared that all the food was to our liking. Never had to ask for a drink refill, which is a pet peeve when I dine out!  Best to make reservations. Easy to park.  Michael and Laura are great hosts, and chances are, one or both will greet you at your table during the course of your stay!  Cons: 1) Between appetizers and main course, dinner choices are fairly pricey - before drinks. Expect to spend $40-$50+ per person + tip. 2) NO SOUP selection(s) on the dinner menu! 3) I like the live music and their selections - but unfortunately, they play WAY too loud for such a small venue. Having a conversation at your table while the band plays is totally impossible.  Summary: If you are looking for a small out-of-the-way place with a nice atmosphere to get great Italian food (fish too!) and service, and not have to constantly ask for drink refills, this is the place! On the other hand, if you want a nice quiet place to dine and converse with a date, go on Tues, Wed, and Thurs night, when there is no live music.",

    "text": "Lets start with the ultra tacky decor. This place has a nice patio area that could be made so nice to sit in, but the plastic plants and other decorations scattered everywhere inside and outside would make even your Italian Nona shake her head in disapproval.  The food is bland beyond belief, yet sometimes salty like crazy. The pasta overcooked to death, which is probably why the place is a senior citizen hub.  The meatballs were classic buffet or airplane food flavor. The marinara was bad bad bad. Of all the bad Italian food in existence in this town, this one should be rated somewhere at the very top of the \"bad\" list. However, I understand that the older clientele appreciates the tacky decor, the bland awful food and the overall atmosphere. They deserve to have a place of their own that caters to their likings, nothing wrong with that I guess. But if you are under 60, or had an actual Italian mother or grand mother who could cook, skip it. The owner seemed nice and friendly. He tried to replace the seafood pasta dish we sent back, but there was simply no time left (lunch break). He might be a very nice guy, but I would not give him the title of \"chef\" under any circumstances.",

The food, particularly my Fetichinni Alfredo, Garlic bread that never stopped coming and the pumpkin ice cream was fabulous! My husband had the Muscles and tried to eat it all but couldn't. There was plenty left over to take home. You definitely do not go home hungry. Not only is Chef Michael the Owner, he also entertains with his guitar and sings. He checks on you to be sure everything is perfect. His wait staff is wonderful and makes you feel like you really are at his Mother's House!  I can't say enough about this place. One thing is for sure, I will be telling everyone about it!",

From the presentation of specials to the countless stories that he shares about performing in Vegas' younger days. My wife and I are vegan and Mike was able to accommodate us with a delicious pasta and veggie plate. My 5 other family members (meat eaters) were served big beautiful plates of food to share. We all enjoyed the experience very much. We finished with a happy birthday dessert, again, beautiful served and brought with a sparkler! Thank you for welcoming us in and treating us to such a lovely dinner.",

Apparently the band only plays 2 nights per week; we just got lucky that we arrived on one of those nights because the music was outstanding. Now the food...it was outstanding. Our table had a mixture of seafood, polenta, and pasta - it was all very good. Also, did I mention that their bread and sauce was good? Well, it was outstanding!!! They had an excellent wine selection and the service was beyond expectations. I recommend this place to all local residents to include anyone visiting Las Vegas. The food is good 24/7, but if you can plan it, try to visit them on one of the live music nights. Recommend making reservations too because everyone knows this place rocks! Thanks for the wonderful experience...and thanks for your support to the military!",

    "text": "Went to My Mother's House a few weeks ago and had a wonderful time. Great food and entertainment. We made a reservation approximately one month in advance to take some very special friends for a fun evening. It was a disaster, very obvious they had over-booked for the evening. The first issue was we were seated at a table with wobbly folding chairs in the corner with a clear view of where the cooks were preparing meals and the main passage way for the waiters. We were then told by our waiter (Franco) that he did not want to \"rush\" us but, we needed to order prior to a large party's order was put in. To me that is clearly being rushed. We did place our order as requested. We were served an appetizer, drinks and three baskets of bread while a large party which was seated 45 minutes after us were served their meal while we continued to wait. When asking our waiter about our meal his response was \"I asked you to get your order in\". We had now been waiting 1 1/2 hour and no sign of meals. At that point we asked for our drink and appetizer check to leave. We were very disappointed and not to mention embarrassed because of wanting to treat our friends to a special evening. Our advice to the owners would be not to book patrons that they are unable to accommodate. Needless to say \"My Mother's House\" will be marked off our list to dine or recommend.",

Several dishes came family style.  The Eggplant and the Ravioli plate were our favorites, but everything was great.  Chef Mike even entertained us with a song.  We ended up closing the place down, because we were having so much fun.  Save room for dessert.  We didn't, but we ate it any way.  You leave stuffed with great food and memories of a good time.

I say that because there was no marinara sauce and VERY LITTLE sausage, but it was piled with cheese so at best it was nothing more then Mac n Cheese with a kick as for  the flavor, well there was none. It did come with a salad which was ok I guess there was nothing to it but chopped up lettuce with an onion, now when I say onion I don't mean chopped up onion, they literally took an onion n cut into quarters and put the entire quarter of an onion on top of the salad. Now if that's the Italian way then it's all good, Ehh! The garlic bred was good though. So all in all I paid $43.00 for some glorified Mac n Cheese and a very blah salad. It's safe to say I won't give them another chance. Thank you for your time",

    "text": "Five star atmosphere, entertainment and wonderful hosts but not sure what happened with food the night we were there.  Ordered Chicken Piccata, received a small piece of poached chicken breast and zucchini in an overly lemon sauce laden with Olives. Hello! What happened to the Capers? I returned the dish and decided to go with Chicken Marsala. This, too was nothing like I'd ever seen resembling the dish. I received an over cooked, tough heavily breaded chicken cutlet hardly with a sauce not resembling Marsala. I've never even seen Chicken Marsala with a heavily fried Chicken Cutlet. The cutlet could have been served with a variety of sauces vis-a-vis Cacciatore, Parmigiana. In fairness the salad greens they served...greens only, no tomatoes, but with a hint of red onion did have a delicious dressing. Three of the people at my table left their food and and said their dishes were mediocre. One of those customers was an  accredited chef. So I am not alone in my thoughts. I will return to the restaurant for the hospitality and entertainment but will eat sparingly. Our host did mention he had two new chefs. Perhaps they were having an off night!",

We got into one of the last tables and enjoyed live music during dinner. We felt that prices were very reasonable for how quality the food was and how HUGE the portions are. We split a pasta and salad and had more leftover. We also had desserts (it would be a crime if you didn't). We were welcomed with open arms and talked to throughout the whole meal, which made us feel like family. Our waitress Kris, was very kind and super knowledgeable about the menu. This place is a gem in the Vegas local community. It's nice to have dinner and entertainment without going near the strip or Fremont. The only downfall is that this place is way too close to my house; they're never going to see the end of me! Thank you so much! We will be back very soon.",

    "text": "Way overpriced for microwaved food!!!!!!!!! The desserts are not home made!!!!! My girlfriend and I were recommended this restaurant so we decided to go on our next visit to Vegas. After 5 minutes of sitting down, a busboy came by for water, and he did not look happy at all. The next time he came by we had a little conversation, and some more on the next few times he refilled our waters.  Every single pasta serving is microwaved, and so is the lasagna!!!! No wonder it was pretty awful. Tasted boiled. Wish I asked him before I ordered it. He told me he saw the cooks dropping food on the floor and still tossing it in the pan, trying to justify it saying that \"whatever dirt would get cleaned out by the frying oil\"!!! The pasta sides are absolutely disgusting, super overcooked and obviously microwaved. They have no clue what \"al dente\" means since they cook it in the morning or the day before and microwave it and quickly boil it before serving. Now to the very best part. The owner keeps bragging about his food, his rating etc. Obviously he does about his desserts too. I ordered a tiramisu and my girlfriend got a st Anthony's cup. They are all pre-made, the tiramisu comes in boxes and they cut it in the kitchen in tiny slivers, and st Anthony's cup and limoncello desserts are all bought in and just unwrapped and served!!! How can you lie about the best tiramisu and other desserts saying it's your grandma's recipe when it's bought in containers??????? I'd have been happier to just eat it and not being lied to since it's not that bad, but all that bragging and lying is totally unnecessary!!!  We also found out that another bus boy named a Eric and a couple other people make the salads (which are comped before your meal arrives) without washing their hands!!!! How sick is that??? Newsflash for you, so-called 4.8 rating restaurant , it's rule number 1 in food handling to instruct your employees to wash their hands every single time they handle food!!!!!!! Will never eat there again, wish we didn't listen to my aunt to go try this two-bit restaurant",

    "text": "The atmosphere here was great! Very personable and felt just like back east. The stories Chef Mike would tell reminded me of home. They have entertainment on Fri-Sun. I wish it weren't so loud though, was hard to have a conversation and for the waiter to hear what we were ordering. I would say it's cramped in there. The table next to us had their chairs touching ours and it was almost impossible to get out without everyone having to get up. The antipasto was amazing! The roasted red peppers had such a great flavor! I ordered a chocolate egg cream, which I used to get all time in NY so I was very excited to see it on the menu. It was lacking flavor. Definitely needed more chocolate, and was a little watered down. A few tweaks and it could be just as good as the diners back home! We had a large party with us and my parents were sold on the brisket, that they claimed was so tender you could cut it with a spoon, or it's on the house. It was in fact very tender. However, the brown gravy served with it was not great, and the canned green beans were too mushy. Also, I don't believe macaroni is a good choice to serve with this dish. The brown gravy and sauce don't go together. I had ordered the shrimp Alfredo. When it was brought to me the waiter had given me shrimp scampi. He apologized and said it would be out soon. I'm not even joking when I say that my Alfredo was in front of me in 2 minutes! Most people would be very happy for that, however that is too soon to put together a dish. The sauce was watery, and I'm not sure if it's because it was rushed or if that's how it's happy served. Was also lacking A LOT of flavor. Needed salt, and much more cheese. To be honest it tasted like jar sauce. My boyfriend had ordered the spaghetti and crab, which Chef Mike made it seem like it was angel hair with jumbo lump crab meat and crab sauce on top. When he came to our table to ask what we ordered he yelled back to the kitchen and told them to scoop extra crab on top, which we thought was very generous. Well.... when my boyfriend received his dish, it was not how we expected. Not like how he's used to getting back in Philly. There was a small crab on top and to my unbelievable shock, the 'jumbo lump crab' meat that was scooped on top, was imitation crab. Yes. Imitation crab. He thought it was pieces of rigatoni on top so he made me taste it (I'm a chef and food reviewer so I know my stuff very very well) I was floored that they would advertise spaghetti and crab, no less charge $30 something dollars for it, and not even give real crab?? Everything was lacking flavor, the people who work there were very nice, but food wise, it just wasn't for me. Another thing that we noticed, there was a family of Asians at a table eating, and Chef Mike kept saying how he was craving egg rolls and wonton soup, then sang a song about Chinese food to that family of Asians. I thought that was a little weird. There was also a mother and daughter that were reunited after 47 years after the mother had given her daughter up. He made a joke how the mom owes her 47 Christmas gifts. Little things like that I don't think are appropriate to say, even if you are joking around.",

You'll feel like you just walked into an authentic Italian restaurant (From New York). Big loud welcome from the owners. He greets many guests and enjoys having conversations with the tables. On certain days live music.   I recommend coming to this place with 3+ people. The portions are family style so for the price of each dish you might only end up with 1-2 entrees depending on the number of people. Dishes start from $25+. Don't let that scare you they are very generous with portion sizes. Garlic bread (AMAZING, don't eat too much before food) and antipasti salad served with most dishes as an appetizer. Overall it was a nice night out. However I would plan on coming with a larger party than 2 if we went again because of the portion sizes.   Ordered the chicken  Parmesan and linguine with a meat sauce. Chicken Parm was great and it was a large thick piece. The pasta is served under the chicken in a large bowl which we didn't know so I would have not got the meat sauce if I knew that was the case and would have rather tried their red sauce instead. Cannoli cream was too rich for me but if you love cannolis then you might enjoy this.",

They do not make their own pasta, but if you have ever made fresh pasta, you know how long that takes.  In restaurant terms, add 5 bucks to the price of the meal :-)  I had the chicken Marsala: great homemade sauce with nice beefy mushrooms, and THE MOST TENDER CHICKEN I have ever had in a Marsala.  I asked the chef for the secret and he gave it to me ...  I am not gonna share it.  Go and ask yourself :-)  Brilliant!  Meatballs?  Homemade and not simply hamburger rolled into a ball.  Clearly a family recipe developed over generations.  Sausage?  Don't get me started!  One small secret: he grinds fresh fennel into almost a powder do you don't get the annoying BANG of 2 bits of full fennel in one bite.  I loved the bolognese as well, some of the best I have ever had!  Once again, clearly a recipe that has been developed over generations.  When it comes to dessert, please ask for what is made in house, like the Tiramisu, or the lemoncello ice.  The Tiramisu was fantastic, but the lemoncello did not make it home somehow.  I could swear I watched her put it in the box for all the to-go food I got, but somehow it was not there when I got home.  So sad :-(  BEST PART?  They deliver!!!!!!  I think I might have an account with these guys by the end of it all :-)",

Chef Mike came to greet us at our table to tell us the night's special, who then gave my daughter a huge free lollipop and free garlic bread basket for coming in. The garlic bread was great and came with a bolognese dipping sauce that was fantastic! My wife ordered the chicken piccata and I had the linguine with clams. The main dishes were very good and they come in generous portions. 2 lbs of linguine and 1/2 lb of clams! I had enough to bring home for another meal. This place was so great that they made a bowl of penne for my daughter and gave her a bowl of ice cream, no charge! With such great service, we left a generous tip! This place is fantastic and makes you feel like family the moment you step in! My family will be back soon!",

Once we walked in we were amazed! The place was very nice, clean, and loved the decor. I recommend making a reservation because we went on a Saturday and all the tables were reserved, luckily we were there 2 hours before the reservation. We got some very great bread as an appetizer. Our waiter was soooo nice, really helped us as to it being our first time there. The family portions were huge! Great flavor we were able to feed 4 people with two plates of the family size (lots of leftovers). Great family owned restaurant, a must try!",

Upon sitting down we noticed the $5 per person fee to eat during entertainment, would have been nice to know that before.   The owner and his wife were incredibly friendly had hospitable, thats about as good as it got.  The music made any conversation impossible, the waiter seldom made rounds and after nearly an hour waiting for food, I was very let down.  Everything from the garlic bread to the chicken marsala tasted like salt with an overbearing garlic taste as well. My wife and our friends dishes had the same problems, it was bad enough where i wouldn't even take leftovers home.",

All were delicious, my only complaint was the chicken piccata could have used more lemon and perhaps capers, but that's just my personal preference. Desserts were delicious too.   Our whole table smiled, sang, laughed and danced the entire time. I can't say enough about how great this place is! Thanks Chef Mike!",

Classic Italian family cooking, great portions, and so tasty. And if you are lucky chef Michael will sing for you! We had the gnocchi with meatballs in the fabulous red sauce, the frutti di mare, and the lasagna. All were amazing. Also recommend the CMS red wine.  Come hungry and leave happy.",

The food was delicious especially the brisket and tempura cauliflower...loved everything about My Mother's House and will definitely recommend this place to others and will come back again, and again.

Michael, Laura and Cheryl were so personable and made my visit really special.  I ordered the Chicken Sinatra and it was delicious! The sauce was to die for with the garlic bread. I am now a big fan and will come back again and again. Thank you Michael, Laura and Cheryl!!!",

Lunch menus a bit small with just sandwiches except they did have rigatoni and meatballs for the special which my mom got. I got a meatball sandwich which came with some pasta. Both were excellent! The waitress was super friendly as soon as you step in here you feel like you're part of the family. The waitress told me that the owner sings and we just missed him singing. He came over to our table with his guitar and sang to my 93-year-old mom. That made my day! He's a great singer and  musician, that was so nice of him to do that. Super friendly guy that's the chef as well. I checked out the dinner menu and I really want to come back for dinner. It gets super busy at dinner time so you have to make a reservation. I'll be back for sure",

Many others have commended on the food and ambience so I'd like to say a word about an aspect that I believe detracts from a truly enjoyable evening. Specifically, the noise level. Overpowering noise from bands that can virtually blow you out of your seat. We were guests at a wedding related event last Saturday evening and had to contend with music so loud it was difficult to carry on a conversation with the person sitting across the table. We had heard that the restaurant was noisy but weren't prepared for what was essentially an orchestra in such a small room. Our understanding is that music is not featured every evening so if we return it will definitely be on a night that it is absent. Otherwise, MMH does not disappoint and is definitely worth a visit.",

They brought a small dish of antipasto. I mixed that with the salad they brought. The salad had lettuce and sweet white onions. When mixed with the antipasto the dressings mixed so well I could have just had that for dinner. The taste of the combined salads was past great. I had the aunt Carmela  dish with linguine. That dish had meatballs, sausage, and eggplant parmigiana to go with the linguine. The taste of each item in the dish was fantastic. This place will be one reason to get excited about returning to Vegas. Thank you to the entire staff.  On a side note. Very new restaurant I think you're going to need reservations within 30 days.
