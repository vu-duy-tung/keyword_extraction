When you ask for fresh stuff they tell you this is it until the next batch comes out which can be an hour or so. They do have a variety of selection the crabs are way too salty. The sushi rice was hard as a rock. They only thing they got right was the drinks. Not worth $46 for dinner. You are better off going to In and Out burger place.",

The variety of fish is not very impressive. There's no baked, broiled, or smoked fish. The salad bar is very sad. As far as fresh vegetables go, your salad choices are greens and tomatoes, and then the rest of the salad bar is just composed of candied fruits. I was expecting to see chopped cucumbers and sprouts and you know, a real salad bar with actual variety! Not everyone wants to fill up on only heavy dishes. Fresh salads would have been nice.  The seafood that they do have is delicious and the bean salads that they have are nice, but after serving two small plates of cold seafood, I felt bored and unsatisfied. I walked around the buffet a few times but nothing stood out to me. The variety of foods just does not look appealing. I left the buffet hungry. You know something is wrong when you leave a buffet hungry. For the expensive price tag, I would not return.",

    "text": "Dear Aria Buffet: YOU RUINED FATHER'S DAY FOR US.  I took my husband here for Father's Day because he wanted to try this place out - this buffet ruined our holiday, single handed. As an avid buffet adventurer, I have been to 90% of the buffets offered on the Strip - and, congratulations, you are by far the WORST one yet. Before you start defending your so-called gourmet delicacies, I'd like to say that I am not a buffet expert, a chef, or anyone who knows culinary art. However, I have eaten at a LOT of buffets, more than I care to count, mainly because I enjoy variety in my food and the endless possibilities, and I'd like to think that I have at least somewhat of an idea of what food is supposed to taste like. But, let me make my case:  1. The food..MEDIOCRE, at best. For a very expensive buffet ($50/person), it lacked everything that an expensive buffet had. Let me start with the selection - limited, bland, and everything was just all wrong.  ASIAN - they had vegetable dumplings, vegetable potstickers, vegetable everything (more on veggies later). There were only 2 choices of soup there, fried rice, chow mein, and crab legs. ITALIAN - spaghetti, some kind of veggies (again), veggie lasagna, a bowl of banana chips and a bowl of cranberries (WTF?).  CARVING STATION - meats were cold...they just sat there under a heat lamp, but once it hit your plate, it went cold quick.  TANDOORI - I'm sorry, I'm not Indian, but I swear the \"tandoori chicken\" looks/tasted exactly like baked chicken. Not sure why they even tried to pass that off as anything tandoori. The rest of the curry tasted like melted mustard. DELI - didn't even try this station, it just looked like a large collection of Lunchables meats and cheese.  FISH MARKET (seafood station) - The station was full of duplicate foods just too make it look like it was filled. Two buckets of crab legs, 2 buckets of crawfish, 2 buckets of mussels, and 1 bucket of oysters. The oysters looked like they were picked from the bottom of the reject buckets from other, better, buffets. The oysters were stale tasting, and they sat in a pile on the ice...the ones on top were warm and the ones on bottom were still frozen. Pretty sure they're not supposed to be like that at all - something about food regulations, I'm sure.  DESSERT - this is by far the only dessert station on the Strip that pales in comparison to the dessert bar at my local 9.99 Chinese buffet. The desserts aren't even made there - they came from a box, and all your \"chefs\" did was pull it out of the box and plop it on a plate. And seriously, who serves chocolate chip cookies and boxed pies? At a $50/person buffet? I expected this from the $9.99/person Chinese buffet down the street from my house, but not from YOU, fancy-hotel&buffet-on-the-strip. I was really, really disappointed.   2. Did I mention the customer service? The \"chef\" at the seafood station was rude and nasty. I was standing next to a young girl waiting for the prawns. She obviously didn't know ENglish because the chef asked what she wanted and she just pointed at the grill. He proceeded to YELL at her at least a half dozen times with things like \"WHAT?\" WHAT DO YOU WANT?\" \"YOU WANT ONE? TWO? WHAT DO YOU WANT???\" It got to the point that the girl hung her head down, shook her head and walked away. It was the worst type of customer service I had ever experienced. And this asshole of a chef just looked at me and asked me what I wanted, \"WHAT YOU WANT?\" and I just walked away. It was despicable. The second instance of poor customer service was when I had to ask for a water refill...TWICE. On a day where the facility was not even half full...there were empty tables around us. Why did I have to keep asking for water when we are literally 1 out of only 4 tables for you? Seriously.  To be quite frank, the food did not deserve the $110.00 I spent for my husband and I that day. What really made me bad was the poor customer service; I was embarrassed for the hotel more than anything. I work really hard for my money - and I don't mind paying a lot of money for good food (Bacchanal's price is even lower than this dump) - but seriously, the food did NOT justify the price. Furthermore, the customer service left a bad taste in my mouth. I have already started telling my friends, family, and co-workers not to waste their money on such a poor excuse of a \"buffet\" - you're better off sticking with your mom & pop Chinese buffet down the street - you'll get the same food, but you'll save $40/per person.",

    "text": "Very disappointing dinner. In a city known for its delicious, extravagant buffets, and in this brand new hotel, for $37, I expected much more.  We mostly went for the unlimited wine (chardonnay or merlot) and lobster. No line at 5PM and our party of 11 was seated right away. We were also made to go back to the line and pay a separate 18% gratuity charge when they realized we were all in the same group. Sure, we are served wine, and we probably would have left something anyway, but a forced gratuity for a BUFFET is just ridiculous in principle. That meant we had no intention to leave anything else.   Our waiter, who turned out to be awesome, started by bringing small carafes of whatever wine we wanted. He ended up bringing 4 or 4 at a time and just leaving them on the table. You definitely won't go thirsty here.   The food was not as much of a selection as most other buffets I've been to. Not many desserts and they weren't as good as other buffets. The rest of the food consisted of carved meats (including salmon), sushi, crab legs, peeled shrimp, some Asian stir fries, salad, pasta, and a few others. Nothing was spectacular enough for me to want to go back for more, and they seemed to be missing most of the basics. The crab legs were pre-cut in half, which I liked (I'm lazy).   Each person got 1/2 a lobster, which I really enjoyed. If you like lobster, crab legs, shrimp, and as much wine as your heart desires, this is the place to you. But the other food left us all disappointed for what we paid and for the expectations of this hotel.",

You have a lot of different genres of food, Asian, sea food, Mediterranean, Latino, American and steaks. The dessert area had gelato looking ice cream, a little more ice cream texture. They also had pastries and cheesecakes.   The kids ate everything and I left satisfied and full. Oh I can't forget this part - bottomless BEER, mimosas and Bloody Mary's for $12.99 so so so WORTH IT.",

    "text": "I am posting my review I wrote to the establishment.  I am not one to moan and complain about something but being in the industry I feel I need to give feedback about my buffet experience since Aria takes so much pride in it.  Granite the buffet was free, this was a horrible experience.  I am not complaining because I want anything free or I am trying to down your casino/buffet.  You have a wonderful casino, from gambling options to hotel, to awesome guest relations but your buffet needs improvement, a lot!  When I came into Vegas all I have been seeing on advertisement is how good your buffet is.  I don't have a really high standard for buffets but when I visited Wicked Spoon last year at the Cosmo, the bar went through the roof.  I never try to compare buffets but when one hits the fan such as your I want to notify your establishment.  I always wanted to check out Aria's buffet because how you acclaim that it is amazing, so I decided to give it a try.  To start me off, how you list your food options on the chalkboard is definitely creative but hard to digest.  Digest being the board sometimes is in the middle of the option food bar and trying to distinguish which item is which becomes a little tough especially when there is a line of people behind you and you don't want to hold them up.  The choices were not neaten and seemed a little trashy like a Home Buffet.  The food at best was par and the lady cutting the prime rib told me my piece of meat was med/rare when clearly it was medwell+.  I wasn't going to argue with her because there was a line behind me and I am easy going but that is the first time I didn't finish a piece of A1-Prime rib.  It was dry and not appealing.  Your Asian selection was definitely below par.  Half the food didn't taste fresh and the steam pork bun was super dry.  The only plus side was your seafood selection.  I mean it is hard to mess up cold seafood but it was the only and the best part of dinner.  The worst part of about the experience was the server Victoria.  She seems like a nice lady but if she was doing full service she would crash.  I don't know if she was overwhelmed or was behind but it is not that hard to grab a spoon or listen to a specific drink request which she both botched. My guest and I asked her for a spoon two separate times and she did not return with one.  She didn't get the drink request right and she barely came by to clear done items off the table.  I still left her a good tip because it was a free buffet but that left a sour taste in my mouth.  I served before and it is almost an insult that she fails at a buffet which is the easiest serving job in a world.  If someone was to ask me to recommend a buffet to them in Las Vegas I would not say yours until it improves.  dp",

    "text": "Really not impressed at all. After waiting twenty minutes for a table (when half of them were empty, apparently they were trying not to open that section or something?), we sat down and waited for drinks. Ten minutes later, after not having seen a waitress, we decided to get food and figured we would order drinks when we got back. After finishing my first plate, I got up and asked one of the hostesses if she could send a waiter/waitress over to get our drinks, as ourselves and the other three tables around us were still waiting on that.   She could have been polite. Instead, she literally told me that I was being impatient (no water or any other drinks after 20-25 minutes), and basically told me to sit down and be quiet, and that they'd get me drinks when they were ready to.   We should have left then, and asked for a refund. The manager did very little to help, though she did say she would have a talk with her staff and see what happened. We got our drinks more than a half hour after being seated at our table, and the food was mediocre at best. I also had an upset stomach that afternoon, and that was the only thing I'd eaten since the day before.   I only rated it two stars because the food was so-so, but it was pretty bland and after the entire experience, it was NOT worth it. I wouldn't go back, and the staff's rudeness has made certain that the Aria will not see another dollar our of my wallet.",

I really liked the way they cut them so it was easy to eat. They looked sliced for you so you didn't have to do the hard work and have to crack them which was awesome  :) tasted great with the melted butter.   I loved the curry chicken ! Really really good, flavor was perfect along with the Nann and Biryan rice   The dessert was good, lots of gelato flavors. Carrot cake was good :)  Overall was memorable enough  to want to return for my future visits to Vegas :) and also next time I will make sure to not have a stomach full of Fat Tuesday slurpy right before coming here lol I think I could have enjoyed it more lol",

    "text": "Giving this a 3 star rating, +1 because we won $1500 at the Aria.  Buffets are to get stuffed. And this does it well. Price was decent if you go prior to 330pm.  Personally I favored the seafood and the carvery. Tried the asian food, was probably worse than Panda-Express quality.   Also if you don't intend on drinking more than 2 beverages from the bottomless well, just go ahead and pass on that. Not worth the extra 12 bucks in my opinion.   NOTE: Took the monorail to get to the Aria. And it was quite the journey (not in a good way). The monorail says you have access to the Aria from the Bally's/Paris station... This is far from accessible. You have to walk all the way through Bally's casino floor to the front entrance where we were greeted with 120 degree heat and escalators that didn't work. Then up and across the street to the Bellagio, then all the way through the Bellagio casino floor to the opposite side to the tram that takes you to Crystals. Then through the Aria casino floor and finally to the Buffet. The walk was probably 4 times the time it took to take the monorail from LVH to Bally's.",

The stations were as follows:  seafood sushi breads/bagels w/ spreads salads cold cuts soup carving counter (ham, roast beef, chicken rope sausage, roast chicken, mashed potatoes, mixed vegetables) Indian w/freshly made naan Mexican pizza sauteed hot dishes Vegetarian cheese and salami Chinese pasta made to order dessert  Compared to other buffets in Vegas, this one for lunch was good. Yeah, and so most of them also strive to keep the guys on \"Deadliest Catch\" going for another season by serving the king crab legs, sliced in half, with drawn butter and lemon. Aria's were sweet and tasty!  The boiled prawns, on the other hand, were watery and devoid of flavor. The shrimp cocktails were awesome while the scallop and mussel ones were kinda rubbery.   Loved the ham but the roast beef was one of the TOUGHEST and least flavored pieces of meat I've ever tasted. Was I at Arby's?! They also had no visible condiments available like mustard, horseradish, au jus, etc  The Indian, Mexican, and Chinese food rocked and made up for the sad roast beef.  Desserts were hella great!  Would I come back? Mmm, YES, but it just wouldn't be my 1st, or 2nd choice!!!",

    "text": "Didnt take long to figure out what was going on here. The Aria is so unapologetically expensive coupled with the fact that it is actually laid-out to make money that you come to the buffet just looking for a good deal. The reason you will pick the buffet for breakfast is bc there is no coffee makers in the rooms, no place to buy a coffee besides starbucks, and the line for starbucks EVERY MORNING is about 25-45 min. It literally wraps around the outside of the store. If you do get your coffee here its about 2 bucks more then any other starbucks. So you go looking for the buffet bc you are almost going to spend that much picking up some drinks and a few light snacks.  The buffet will have a line but its a line for food, right? The staff is not cheerful, the waitress's were talking about personal business while deciding where to sit us. Thats never bothered me before but we stood there for awhile while they chatted. The server was SHOCKED that I would ask for coffee AND a coke?!  The Aria bills there buffet as being special \"a new kind of way to buffet\" or something? because they have international stations. THIS IS NOT NEW ARIA.  Some of the international offerings at breakfast are a huge station for dim sum, egg rolls, chinese food (same every morning) hummus, babaganoush, the cucumber sauce, flat bread - all average. Like the stuff you get at the olive bar at a grocery store, maybe even less flavorful. No one was really eating it.  There is enough breakfast options to leave you really happy the first day. But by the second day you will be trying to find something new. So like me, maybe you will try the beautiful salad bar. 3 different types of lettuce mixes, 3 choices of dressings, and a man to spin it in a bowl for you... Until you get to the topping choices, garbanzo beans? canned beets? The only thing I could find to put on my salad was carrots! No fresh cut veggies, no nuts, only blue cheese. It was so weird. The shrimp was good but the cocktail sauce was not fresh. The one mussel I got to try had an enormous barnacle inside so I passed on that. I did eat a lot of bagels and lox but I know a small part of the population are into smoked salmon for breakfast because I happen to be a chef.  Overall I used to be in charge of the buffet at a 4 star hotel in Texas and  our buffet was far better. Made to order omelets, some kind of roast with a sauce (they have roasted chicken with brown gravy that was dry), a bunch of different premade mixed salads with fresh veggies and marinades.   But again, if you dont come to the breakfast buffet you will spend as much or more at the Aria Cafe/room service/ or the hellacious starbucks with the 25 min line and spiked prices.   So enjoy the buffet!",

The sushi was maybe the best item and it was mostly California rolls. There is a large selection of ice cream, but the lady serving it acted like you were putting her out when you picked one.

Aria served a mix of Indian food, Chinese food, fresh sushi, steamed and cold crab legs, scallops, fish, pork shoulder, prime rib and carved ham and chicken.  Even the salads were better and prepared in front of you by chefs. After all that you can hit the dessert table and get Butterfinger ice cream. As you can imagine, I felt fat.",

Went to get am omelette, came back and ate and still no one had taken our order for drinks.  Asked several staff members for cream cheese and everyone answered the same thing.....\"can you go ask the guy behind the counter\"  when I finally found that guy he said they were out of cream cheese.  I just wanted a bagel with cream cheese and my coffee and couldnt get either at a buffet?????  Wow!!!  Asked to speak with the manager and she just apologized, but still my breakfast was ruined or at least not what I wanted.  Did not expect this.  I had been to this buffet before and had a way better experience.",

Salad bar is plentiful and there are numerous toppings. Other items I had were great too.

    "text": "Out of all the buffets that I've ever eaten at in Vegas, this one is the BEST one I've been to so far! They have a huge selection of lots of seafood. There is even a seafood bar that cooks made to order seafood dishes. There was a wait for that, so I never got to try anything there despite it being fairly early in the day. That was really odd to me. There were only three people waiting for the chef to finish cooking the specials. Only a few seafood tacos were out that didn't look that great. I wanted to try the fresh trout and a few other things. I feel like they were just being slow on purpose. Not cool!  My husband and  I came there for a late brunch. This is one of the more expensive buffets out there, but it's worth it! If you love shrimp, you'll love this place! I had some of the best honey walnut shrimp that I've ever had as well as some shrimp dish in a cilantro cream sauce. I've never had anything like it before. I wanted more, but it was all gone when I went back for more-:(  They have a large selection of seafood here like shrimp, crab, and other stuff. They also have sushi, pho, ramen, dim sum, and other types of Asian food. I think that they had pizza too. They had lots of different types of meats. I had some of the best stuffing and green bean casserole ever that day. They have a large selection of soup too. I did'n't try the chicken noodle soup, but my husband said it was good. They also have lots of different types of hummus and dips too. The dips I tried were all good.  There is also a large selection of veggies and some fresh fruit too. The desserts weren't good though. The gelato looked delicious, but it didn't taste good to me. I got the butter pecan and birthday cake one. I didn't finish it. I ate the watermelon and pineapple instead which weren't to sweet, but at least it was fresh and crispy. I guess it's not in season now. You must go here if you love seafood! Also, drinks are served to you at the table unlike other places. The servers are nice and attentive too.  The dining area is huge and clean. Try to go there after the lunch rush or before the dinner rush to avoid the crowds. Hardly anyone was there when we ate there at 2 p.m After eating, you can walk around the gorgeous shopping center that's an indoor mall that has lots of beautiful displays up as well as a few really cool looking restaurants inside. The casino is nice too and not that crowded, at least it wasn't when we were there.",

This last visit was all pastas and fillers, there were basically no meat dishes of any kind anywhere except the carving station and that was less than desirable by being fatty and overcooked with exception of some of the prime rib which depended on when you asked for it.  All the chinese were vegetable side dishes with exception of the chicken pot stickers. Sushi had no nigiri all cheap non meat rolls and was tryingto do poke bowls with warm tuna and scottish salmon. If you dont know what you're doing dont offer it This was not worth the task of going there let alone the $50+ they are charging for it!  This and Bellagio were both HUGE disappointments as they used to be our two favorite places.",

The Italian, Asian and Indian section are great also. I really liked the Asian and carving station the most. Don't forget the desert section where you can get a variety of delicious treats to finish off the meal. And may I add this is the first buffet that I came to that has popcorn.",

I spoke to the concierge desk and the person was really professional and nice and said that the buffet manager will get back to me ASAP.  It doesn't change the fact that everyone is sick right now.

The place is clean and service is always pretty good, but you have to ask for crab leg crackers. They don't automatically give them to you, which is kind of weird.

The seafood was amazing! Their alaskan crab was delicious. They had a great variety of mussels too. Their hacau and shumai in the Asian section was delicious! Not too soggy, and the shrimp and other meat were cooked beautifully. Definitely did not taste like buffet Chinese food.   DESSERT: Their gelato was so rich and creamy. The freezer spins around so you can see all the selections. I loved their cookies & cream. Highly recommend. Their macarons were amazing. The taste and quality of those were at least $2 a pop. I grabbed about 5-7 and each of the flavors had a rich taste. Definitely recommend the lemon and strawberry macaron.   DRINKS: They had a deal going on $20 for 2, unlimited drinks. We thought it was just unlimited mimosas...but NOPE! We got unlimited margaritas, beer, wine, everything! Such a steal.

As I was comped by M Life I went in the Players Club line. The hostess asked for my player's card and told me I was in the wrong line. I said I have a comp and you want me to stand in that line. Snappily she said yes. She said see this sign you don't have the right players card. You'll have to wait in that line. The wait was over 30 minutes and even though it was technically free I wouldn't go back. I prefer my local Asian Buffet at 1/4 of the price. The quality and service are much better. I ate at the Main Street Station Buffet the same week and it was less then half the price with very good quality and very good service. Buyer beware.",

Farmer market feels. 4 star.   * Location:  on the promenade level, by the pool area. Convenient to stop by here before or after hanging out at the pool. Far away from the casino... so you don't have to eat with cigarette smokes. 4 star.   * Meals: fresh.  There are plenty of choices from bagels, oatmeals,  salads to dim sum, roasted beef, omelet... There are a sort of pastries but not much of desert for breakfast.  Food quality is good but not very exciting nor inventive like Wicked Spoon or the Bellagio 's buffet.  4 star.   * Service: friendly waitress. 4 star.  Thus, it is averaged to 4 star based on my PALMS rating!    We did enjoy the seafood station with cocktail shrimps,  crawfish, crab legs, clams and muscles.  The sushi station is very simple with veggie rolls and spicy tuna rolls. Dim sum is good with 3 to 4 items (sumai, bun and congee). There is a Mediterranean and Indian food sections which are also very simple and generic.  We did not go here for lunch nor dinner so could not comment on the other meal selections.   We probably would come back if staying at the Aria since it is pretty good deal for the amount and variety of food.",

    "text": "When I was in Vegas last year, I checked out Aria's buffet to see what was on their menu. What I saw was something spectacularly presented. The price was out of my range at the time, but I had budgeted to attend for this year's visit. Unfortunately, the presentation wasn't nearly as good. What happened? Not only were the dishes plain, but there were crumbs and sauces spilled everywhere. Many of the nameplates above the food weren't there and some were mislabeled. I had to ask a few times to figure out what something was. Another disappointment was when I frequented the Chinese section's \"Dim Sum\" area, many of the bamboo steamers were empty. I checked about 5 times during the span of an hour, and they were out each time. What can make this worse was that a lady behind the dessert section, who was having a bad day, snapped at me for waiting for her to put the food out. At this point, Aria deserved a 1 star from me.  Fortunately, the dishes I sampled were outstanding. The chow fun and fried rice in the Chinese section were very authentic and had great \"wok-hay.\" This translates from Chinese as \"captured flavor by the high-heat from a seasoned wok.\" The tender roast beef was cooked perfectly with small sections of fat attached for flavor. One my favorite items I indulged were Italian large shrimps meant as a pasta topping. I just ate them by themselves. The shrimp was cleaned well, cooked to the right temperature, contained lots of meat, and smothered in a heavenly butter sauce. I had a good waitress and the few dishes I had made it worth coming. In the future, I will probably not return since there are other good buffets to try in Vegas for approximately the same price.",

We came on a weekday for dinner for my most recent birthday trip - and were able to take advantage of a BOGO we got from myVegas (great comp!) so dinner was only like $40 for 2 - total steal!   The variety they have at this buffet is unbelievable - they had crab legs and shrimp and prime rib and various cuts of meat - they have everything - and it was all DELICIOUS! We did get lucky though, I think we were there on a Wednesday and swung in around 7:30PM - and there was no wait and the Buffet was pretty empty - good for us cause we didn't have to wait to be seated or to get food. Their deserts are fabulous too - lots of items in bite size portions so you have the opportunity to try a lot. Even with the regular food, some of it is pre-portioned in cute containers so you can just try a little bit (think mini deep fryer baskets of fried chicken nuggets, mini iron skillets of pot roast, etc...). That being said - presentation is gorgeous as well.  We also love the fact that Aria is still a newer hotel/casino so the decor is modern and it's still very clean. We will absolutely be back :)",

In the case of \"The Buffet\" at Aria, it is the more humble laidback version. The light, bright, and open atmosphere of the buffet and simple, yet delicious dishes means The Buffet is a good choice when at the hotel, casino, or City Center. This isn't really a buffet to go out of your way for in Vegas, but is a nice option if you're already there.  It's only $21 for lunch. If you want all-you-can-drink wine, then try the $37 dinner. The good stuff (aka Gourmet with Lobster) is only served Friday and Saturday dinner. If you are used to Las Vegas buffets, then the pile of crab legs, small selection of sushi, meats, pastas, and salads will seem very familiar. Nothing really stood out or sucked. I liked the pasta with alfredo sauce for some reason and a simple salad. Maybe it was because we were towards the end of our stay. Of course, desserts are a highlight of any Vegas buffet and the same is True at Aria with little cakes, pastries, and ice cream.",

    "text": "Honestly, if it weren't for the free dinner buffet comps, I would never eat here.  In fact, if I paid, I'd probably ask for my money back only because their food is just so old, dry and nasty.  I mean, you would think that ARIA of all places would have a nice buffet, but they don't.  - Indian curries - all watery and spices, naan - old and stale - seafood - old and nasty crab legs - latin - super salty - salad bar - pathetic  - italian - dried up spaghetti noodles, super greasy pizza - desserts - not appetizing. old cookies.  only memorable item was their gelato, dinner roll, and the pepperoni on the pizza.   Again, it was free and I wanted to try it once. I'm not sure what's worse... The Buffet at ARIA or the Mirage Buffet.... they both suck.   I'd highly recommend Bayside Buffet (at Mandalay) over this garbage.  If money is not a problem, go to Bacchanal Buffet (at Caesar's) because it's worth every dollar!",

The lunch options were good, just mostly unappetizing. Dry glazed ham and watery mac and cheese for starters. Favorite part about our meal was probably their gelato, loved the watermelon and thai tea flavors although I wish they offered the option to be served in cones. Other than that the dessert selection was underwhelming - mostly cookies of sorts.",

    "text": "$36 for \"holiday buffet\"?  I asked the hostess what was special about it to warrant the higher price at 3pm.  She said it was bigger and better, more like brunch.  It's an ok buffet, loaded with lots of starchy carbs like breads, pizza, mashed potatoes; lots Of proteins like prime rib, salmon, shellfish, but strangely devoid of vegetables and a real and proper salad bar.  (Of note to vegetarians and vegans or those on a low carb regime.).  Salad was a pathetic little station with small bowls like you'd see at Carl's Junior - in fact Carl's may have a bigger selection at their salad bar.  There's no way you could build a salad meal here.  If you want only a side salad, you're in business.  Grilled vegetables were way across the room on a small dish perhaps 4\" in length at best, next to some cured olives at the \"Mediterranean\" station.  Somewhat pathetic.  A strange orphan station with salsa and guacamole plus sour cream were standing alone on one side of a small kiosk (with sushi and soups) without any appropriate foods that they might actually accompany nearby.... Huh?  Eggs Benedict didn't just have runny yolk, the whites were uncooked. Yuck!  Desserts looked pretty, but some looked a little shop worn (lemon squares), perhaps sitting in the case too long.  On the upside: Indian station,  chilaquilles, a couple of fine cheeses, gelato.  This was visually nice looking but in execution perhaps not the best Vegas buffet.",

The waitress made a special effort to write the birthday boy's name on the plate of desserts she brought, along with a candle, and a song with other employees. Because of the buffet setting, she had a hard time catching him when he wasn't up at the buffet, but she was persistent and that was so appreciated!

    "text": "On a whirlwind tour of buffets in Las Vegas, I came here this past weekend to try the brunch buffet on Saturday.  There was about a fifteen minute wait at about 11 a.m., which I thought was a little surprising.    After having gone to Bachannal for dinner the night before, I wasn't sure my stomach would be able to handle another buffet, but I often think of brunch the way some people think about desserts - it deserves its own stomach!  There's a lot of selection here.  For $30 per person (and an additional $12 for bottomless drinks), I'd say it's a decent deal for a Vegas buffet.  I skipped over most of the Asian food since it looked mostly like reheated frozen stuff and helped myself a lot of the other things.  There's too much to name, but let me hit some of the highlights:  amazing breakfast pizza, yummy pre-made waffles (with different fillings - try the banana), decent corned beef hash, your own made-to-order eggs benedict bar,  a variety of refreshing pre-made salads, an interesting assortment of Indian foods (including naan and curried veggies and meats), etc.  They also have a made-to-order eggs and omelette station.  The ham at the carving station was delicious - lean but tender and flavorful - they have prime rib too if that's your fancy.  In other words, there's something for everyone here!  There were some foods that weren't so great.  I felt like this was much more common in the dessert department.  For example, the donut that I had tasted crusty and dry, and a lot of their cakes tasted like they'd been sitting out for a while.  I probably wouldn't get an omelette again either - they're far too big and I don't like how they don't wrap the ingredients inside but instead intersperse them throughout the egg batter.  Service:  Can't compare to the service you get at Bachannal.  They seem understaffed here (even though the restaurant wasn't at full capacity), and you have to exert some energy to flag someone down.  Bottom line:  A decent option for a brunch buffet in Vegas.  I am realizing I forgot to try the gelato so next time...",

    "text": "This is for their weekend brunch buffet. Honestly, my review might have been about 3 stars maybe if it wasn't for the fact that I found a piece of HAIR in my food! It was a very short, kind of curly hair, which I'm pretty sure we all know what that would remind us of if we saw it in our food. YUCK!! It completely ruined my appetite and I wasn't able to eat any of the main entrees after that. I found it in my medium rare brisket, which I thought AT FIRST was really good, but after seeing that hair I could barely keep it down. The other food I was able to eat before I got the brisket was average. Nothing I'd go crazy for and tell my friends to pay $25. But I wasn't able to try out everything since I got the brisket in the beginning of my meal.  After a while I decided to try out the desserts. They all looked appetizing, as does most buffets with desserts, but they tasted average. Except for the strawberry shortcakes OMG heaven!! As far as from my experience, that is the only thing I'd go back there for to eat.  My friends and I were having trouble deciding on whether to go this buffet or Cosmopolitan's Wicked Spoon. But since we've already been to Wicked Spoon we decided to try this place.  And now I'm sad to say I would have much rather gone to Wicked Spoon than this. It may be a couple of dollars more expensive, but the quality and diversity of the food is definitely worth it.",

The Beef Steamship is a cheap excuse to serve dry, old beef instead of a simple prime rib. Crab legs are reboiled in heavily salted water to eliminate taste buds from sensing the rancid quality of the baby crab legs. I cant note a single thing at the buffet that was memorable or fantastic. Suck it up and pay $10 more for the Bacchanal buffet at Caesar's or pay $20 less at a lower quality buffet anywhere else on the strip to save money and receive the same quality of food.   The redeeming quality is the waitstaff and cashiers. Fantastic service trying to muddle the horrendous nature of the disgusting food...",

Everything was good but nothing was great. The major downfall was the dessert section which offered very little (s'mores popcorn, two types of cookies, and a few other items that I can't recall). The best part was the Mediterranean sections where the offered several types of hummus and pita chips. Compared to the MGM grand down the street, for a much more reasonable price, I felt a bit let down. I struggle to write anything less than 5 star for Aria because it's one of my favorite casinos to visit when in Las Vegas.

And since most of the hotel is under renovation (nightmare) and a lot of it's eateries arent set up yet, we went over to Aria because we are quite familar with it, staying at Vdara often throughout the year. Park MGM is connected to Aria via a long walkway or the CityCenter tram.   I've always wondered how the The Buffet was having walked by it many times. It was Sunday around 1pm and the lines were LONG. Thankfully my MLife (Gold) status was able to place us in an expedited line but we waited at least a good 15+ minutes or so before being seated for our party of 2. Once seated, you can relax and strategize how best to tackle the buffet. There were many different food options from seafood to pasta to dim sum and even spanish cooking. There was a prime rib/roast/sausage section where they cut your meat for you. There was a shellfish station that was very popular. I got a little bit of everything. I had some dimsum (har gow & siu mai) and sauteed green beans, all from the Asian section of the buffet. I got spanish rice and bacon. Random but great pairing I thought. Ha! I also got Mexican pinwheel crackers, pizza, naan bread, prime rib and bratwurst. Two plates were all I could about handle. I got a little bit of dessert but I was plenty full by then. Some bread pudding, caramel popcorn, macaroons and a slice of carrot cake.   All the food was decent. Nothing really stood out. As far as Vegas goes, The Buffet at Aria is about middle of the pack. It was good enough but not great like Bacchanal or Wynn Champagne Brunch. For what we paid, it wasnt bad. $34 per person. You can choose to eat what you like. Very many options. Service was decent. MLife membership pays... Got us in quicker. Way quicker.",

From start to finish, I was floored by the sheer number of options, beautiful playing, great service, and exquisite taste of everything. If you're in Vegas, this is an absolute must try!  It's no secret that buffets are often talked up but fail somewhat to deliver on taste and freshness. Let me tell you-- the Buffet at ARIA is unlike any other buffet you've ever been to. There is so much food, but somehow they manage to keep everything fresh and hot to the point where it feels like it was made just for you. Everything is organized into stations, so that makes making your way through everything a little more manageable and less overwhelming.   Again, everything I had was great, but here's the shortlist of my favorite things at the brunch buffet. The giant meatball!! It's in its own cute little serving bowl and is served on a bed of spaghetti and let me tell you-- it is to die for. Literally, it's the best meatball I've had in my life. If it wasn't so huge, I would have had another. Next up, the barbacoa at the Latin American station! The meat is incredibly tender and perfectly spiced. I had bits of this several times throughout my visit to the buffet. Their kielbasa!! Now I know what you're probably thinking-- kielbasa is really one of the best things on this buffet? YES. It's juicy beyond belief, and the smoky and savory flavor is unreal. My whole family ooh-ed and aah-ed over this one. They also have tons of fruit and veggies and I know that vegetarians would get along great here, but I was really feeling all the meats that day.   There's way more delicious food than I can fit in a review, but trust me-- you'll be so happy you ate here, so go!!",

Here are some highlights from their weekday brunch:  Kielbasa, prime rib, cowboy steak -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lhls4l&s=e0720410b2d818116178244e99573231cb2104257f55ad62211fc827e1bb9811\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lhls4l</a> Short rib, scallop potatoes, shrimp & grits -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lgi8pT&s=5c0d319b35941ef5f5c0a3c0a7a21a71a42cc418ae2b1d3ddf5e55728c7e1026\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lgi8pT</a> Apple Cider & Blood Orange Creamsicle Gelato -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2lf8ILB&s=a1f2255525091e946322d713eaa42668e43deb23afc2a70a69c5e36674abee69\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2lf8ILB</a>  As I said earlier, the food was good, but not too much to brag about which is like how it is any any other buffet.  I enjoyed the first plate I had from the carved meats station and also the short rib and and shrimp & grits were delicious.  And no complaints with their gelato selection, the apple cider and blood orange creamsicle gelato were refreshing and a great way to finish off my buffet session.  I think what turned me off was how they left a lot of signage out there that were incorrectly displayed for the food being served at the time.  I naively picked up some scallop potatoes when the sign said they were bone marrow.  I should've known better since scallops and bone marrow are completely distinguishable.  But there were a lot of displays where I would see Chicken & Waffles and they have just pancakes out.  That was pretty disappointing.  Another disappointing thing was how even though it was already close to lunchtime, they didn't have anything unique to offer.  I was really looking forward to trying stuff from their much-talked about tandoori oven, but it wasn't even fired up.  Overall, weekday brunch at the Aria Buffet was good and with the 2 for 1 coupon we had it made it a great deal.  Though I think for what they offer at $28.99 per person is a little bit lackluster.",

I wanted shrimp but didn't want to spend 10 minutes trying to find a few under a ton of muscles.  The rest of the food was good but it's far from the best buffet on the strip.  I would go somewhere else and spend your money.  I had to add to my review after visiting the desert bar.  I found them bland and generic.  I doubt they are made in-house.  Cheap bulk food.",

    "text": "This buffet has gone through a lot of adjustments over the last few years, but I love that the prices have stayed fairly consistent. In the beginning when Aria opened I really didn't like the dinner buffet very much, and there was a lot of competition on the strip for great buffets. But over the years it has definitely improved. My preference is the brunch, although I was sad that they no longer serve steamed crab legs on the brunch menu during the week. You can still get the cold ones, but the way they steam crab legs there is definitely not the same. Those steamed crabs are delicious. The freshly made naan bread is my absolute favorite thing about this buffet. If all I ever had to eat in life again was crab legs and naan bread I think I would be in heaven. In fact, I hope that's what they serve in heaven.   I do feel like service is a little hindered because there don't appear to be bussers for the tables like there used to be. Or maybe I was just imagining it before? but I could swear that the waiters didn't have it so tough. The waiters are always friendly and accommodating, but they are also trying to bus their own tables in between taking drink orders. I feel at times the customers are not getting paid attention to for simple things. So maybe management could bring back a busser for each section to help the waiters out? Either way, I definitely recommend this to anyone looking for a solid brunch or dinner!",

Came here at 2:30pm and paid the lunch price ($28.99 per person), although we ended up getting to sample the dinner dishes as well since dinner began at 3:00pm. That means I ate my weight in snow crab legs, as they are not offered at lunch and only come out around 3pm. Also opted for the $19.99 unlimited 2-for-1 drinks, which means my girlfriend and I paid $20 for both of us to drink as much as we liked. The drinks included are Blue Moon, Stella, Bud Light (possibly 1 other beer option), wine, champagne, and a selection of cocktails including a delicious rum punch and margaritas (in classic or watermelon lime).   Everything I sampled food-wise was great, especially the snow crab legs, beef barbacoa, curried veggies, and the kale power salad (I don't even like kale, and I was pleasantly surprised--I'm gonna need them to hit me with the recipe!). That said, there is also a decent selection of healthy options, mostly fresh seafood and a big salad bar. Highly recommend this buffet as a good value for money, especially if you eat as many snow crab legs as I did!   Minus 1 star because the dessert was just okay, but there was a huge variety (including gelato) and I didn't try everything.",

We paid, stood in line, while hosts were so slowly and painstakingly seating guests. When it's busy and the dining area is packed, I get it, there's going to be a wait. But why the eff am I waiting for over 15 minutes in a line when the whole place is empty?!?!?  Now since we got that out of the way, the food was just meh. Everything there was either sitting out for a while and tasted dry and rubbery. Even the damn butter you're supposed to dip your crab legs in tasted old and plasticky. I did not expect this kind of low quality food from such a decent hotel and casino. I'm glad that my wife and I were able to get a buy one get one free meal, or I would have been really pissed. the only thing that kept me happy was the all you can drink horchata... It was damn tasty and the only reason why I even gave this place two stars. Also, many of the food labels were either labeled incorrectly or missing entirely, so you couldn't even tell what you put on your plate. When you try and ask the staff, if they're even around, what you're putting on your plate, they're annoyed that you're even asking and hesitantly answers your question.  I'll just say this, spend a little extra or maybe even a little more time standing in a line and go to Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars. This place is just not up to par and not worth it for what you pay. Great Hotel, great Casino, horrible Buffet...",

The place was nice & clean.  A good selection of dishes to choose from.  My fave was the tandoori chicken, seasoned just right.  I was excited seeing Naan, but I thought it was made fresh to order, they were already made & ready to grab, they were just so so.  The small dishes (chips & spinach dip, truffle potatoes, etc) were a nice touch.  Asian food was super salty & I couldn't eat it, so that was a bummer.  The pho was what you'd expect from a buffet.  Mexican food was good.  A decent dessert collection, although everything was mislabeled.    I'm rereading this & wondering why I'm giving it a 4 star review when nothing really sticks out as being super great (except the tandoori chicken) & I think it's the environment that helped, plus a very attentive waitress :).  I would recommend this place, just not when you're craving Asian food.",

They had the basics covered, Asian, Italian, Mexican, American, and a good variety of desserts.   The servers were friendly and I see them moving quick trying to maintain their section. The prices are fair as well.   I do suggest playing those M Life app games that they offer for special deals and discounts. Its free to play and the points can be used towards real deals. My last visit to the buffet was free due to me buying a buffet voucher with points I earned playing through the app. So if you want to save a little, check that out.

I guess over 2,000 people with a three star can't be all wrong. I am quite concern that the Aria management haven't investigated. When I think of this buffet serving this slop. I can only imagine Mr. Aria sitting back in he's big nice chair not caring for his patrons. I believe the state or health department should be called out to investigate.  This is an absolute crime. You pay hundreds to stay here and then they add 39.00 dollars for resort fees. Next, they feed you crap.  Maybe, that's why they give you a complimentary meal during brunch. However, I was there last night for dinner. I really want to ask them for my money back. I write this review, with tears rolling down my face and a heavy heart. I am in total disbelief.   The carved station was extremely dirty. The sliced turkey was over cooked and hard as a rock. The soup and salad station was a mess. The salad bar had no presentation and the soup was cold as ever. The shrimp cocktail was soaking in dirty shrimp water. The snow crab was pencil thin. Horrible!! Just Horrible!! Horrible!!! The food was very nasty. The stations were filthy behind the cook/server. The lady serving the crabs removed her blue latex gloves and stuffed them and did not put on clean gloves. It's unbelievable! Unbelievable!! THE ARIA!!! WOW: (  F. Hess",

The small plates were okay I enjoyed the braised beef on Mash, but I was really just shocked at the overall low quality and undesirable dishes served.   There's little to zero chance I'd come back. The dessert section was cute but I don't really go to buffets for the desserts. I also appreciate that the bathroom was in side the restaurant.",

At $52 a head for a \"holiday dinner\" featuring ear-blasting pop music in an ambiance-less cafeteria setting after waiting in an interminable line, the least you should be able to expect is a non-angry hostess and accommodation of a request not to be seated directly next to the cattle line. Your money is better spent elsewhere.",

Their fresh fish deserves a 5 star for this alone.  I do agree with other Yelpers that the flavor is lacking. Many of the items are just blah.  Service was excellent.  Really great selection of desserts.  I did not eat any of their Asian items as they seemed very sad - and not that fresh.  Staff serving food seemed unhappy.  If seafood and great service are your thing, definitely check this out.  I had a hard time understanding the set up, there were so many different types of foods, everyone in a group would be happy. I think it is worth the value.",

We were here less than 6 months ago and the change is disappointing. This will be the last visit.  A good sign of a good buffet are the wait lines and crowd. The place was almost empty. Old food sitting out cold, wilted lettuce, everything dried out from sitting too long. We usually don't complain much but the last draw were the bad oysters. Two out of four oysters were bad.   If you still must visit, i would suggest going to the lunch. The selection does not change for lunch vs. dinner.",

They had a great variety of foods plenty of crab legs, mussels, sushi, pho, carved meats, fresh vegetables, pastas along with Indian and Mexican selections. The crab legs and mussels were delicious. I tried most of the seafood. Don't forget to leave some room for dessert because they were good as well.   The buffet was huge, modern, clean and comfortable and they had a restroom on site so you didn't need to leave the buffet looking for one. The staff was great and our server was so nice. We didn't have to wait at all to get in.  It's a little pricey but you it's worth it with just the crab legs alone are worth going! I think its better to go for a late lunch just before they switch over to dinner so you can get a little of both at the lunch rate. I will definitely return here next time I'm Vegas!",

We went on a Tuesday night, got in line a bit after 6 p.m. and there was just a short wait.  Everything looked clean and modern.  It wasn't overly busy either.    The only thing I actually enjoyed was the crab, asparagus (huge!) and the Texas shrimp grits were pretty as well.  Everything else I tried I did not enjoy and left on the plate after a bite or two.  The Tandoori chicken and the Paella were both awful.  The flavor was weird (for the lack of a better description).  As for the desert, the creme brulee was so-so, the cannoli was hard as a rock but at least the chocolate gelato was pretty good.  We received poor service as well.  Our table was left with dishes so when we went back to our table, we had to stack them on what little space we had.  The gal brought the wrong drink orders and we had to find her to get some after dinner coffee.    The only good thing was that we used BOGO, but that said, I wouldn't pay to dine here again when there are better buffets.",

I had the privilege of eating at a few buffets in the strip and I rather starve than come back here again. The crab legs come out every few minutes , so no one is fighting for them, there is enough to go around BUT they are unbearably salty. They even cut them for you before boiling so the salt gets absorbed and you are left parched, and when you drink what happens ? You get FULL right away ! Lol Smart people, also what pissed me off was the line is about an hour long ( we waited about 40 min) to be seated and guess what , we counted 14 open tables that no one was being sat at.  They use it as a marketing tool. Also smart but fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. Will never be returning to this buffet sorry Aria, good luck",

What really won me over was the picture of snow crabs.....I never expect too much when it comes to all you can eat crab places because they tend to serve them cold so you only eat so much but these were nice and hoot.   Starting off with the service, I had an amazing buffet hostess/server who cleared my dishes in a very timely manner. I drink a lot of liquids anytime I go out as well so was pleased to see that my server was very nice about all the refills I needed haha.....  The food here was pretty good for the buffet. They had food supposedly from everywhere but I only frequented the seafood and carving station. The Asian food was alright.....the Indian food was ok. I liked the Italian make your own pasta station but the chef was rude and wouldn't pay much attention to the requests I made. Sort of just shrugged them off and did what he wanted to do.... they had a great big selection of dessert as well  For the price they regularly charge I would say that the food itself is not really worth it...I had a discount that came along with my runners perks and don't have any other buffets to compare too but I heard the one at Caesars is really good! Anyway, good day!",

    "text": "Well this is my new favorite buffet...why? Lets see, what really matters about buffets? Firstly, price. At 29.99 its def not the cheapest around, but its also not as bad as Bellagio and a few others.  Secondly: quality. Best quality crab around at buffets, period. Easily better than Bellagio, with warm clarified butter along side, a glaring absence in the Bellagio crab presentation  easy. Plus (this is a secret!) they'll steam your crab legs if you ask!  The shrimp for shrimp cocktails are huge! Way plumper than I have seen at any other buffet  The prime rib was was perfect, braised short rib ragu was for tender, mashed potatos tasted real, rotisserie chicken was juicy, pizza was edible, even their attempt at indian food was pretty good.   Not to mention the dessert was much better than Bellagio.  They have REAL cheesecake and great carrot cake, plus some flambe banana thing that was amazing. 1 thing Bellagio has is rack of lamb (at least on fridays saturdays), but considering all this quality stuff and the price difference, The Buffet is definitely a better choice.  Oh and my waiter was great; fast and polite! P.S. I went to Aria on a thursday, not sure if they amp it up a bit with extra food and higher prices on weekends, most strip buffets seem to do that.",

You know you're in for a disappointment when you ask what the buffet is known for and the hostess says \"well we have crab legs\".  Errr...ok i hardly think that is something worth highlighting.  The crab legs were just ok.  A little too squishy and hard to get out of the shell.  The selection of the food was minimal.  Several cuts of meat, some mediteranean, create your own pasta, salads...really nothing spectacular.  The only dish my husband kept going back for was the spicy potatoes.

    "text": "I think the trick for this buffet is coming in at the right price.  Going in at the tail end of breakfast into lunch is the best, Thurs/Fri brunch would still be an acceptable price.  Anything beyond the $24.95 they charge for that, and it's not worth it.  That's mostly because the variety of food isn't nearly as impressive as the other big buffets - it's completely dwarfed by Studio B at the M Resort, and probably the Wynn and Bellagio buffets as well (but I've been to neither of those and can't say for sure).  We got in towards the tail end of breakfast.  For some reason, the switchover was extremely late, I don't think it started flipping until past noon.  That turned out to be a blessing, as some of their breakfast items were pretty nice - eggs benedict and omelette bar were my favorites.  The brisket at lunch was pretty dang good too.  Avoid most of the Asian food and especially the sushi, I remember those seeming like they were lifted right out of a $10 asian buffet.  Remember to save room for dessert, those were not bad.   The designers did a great job with the dining room - the lighter colors and big windows really help the airy atmosphere,  It's much nicer than the Wicked Spoon's totally enclosed, black and orange motif.  Service was fine for us, but part of that was probably because of our large group of 20.  All in all, wouldn't mind going again if we were staying in a nearby hotel, but depends on the timing, as mentioned.",

First of all, there are 7 people in my family but my 2 kids  already ate at a different restaurant so they weren't hungry. One was 4 and one was seven. So I only paid for 5 people. We got in line and all 5 of us got our food. The food was dry and didn't seem fresh.The pizza was totally dry. The taste was very awkward.  The worst part of all was when the African American manager forced us to pay  for the 7 year old kid who did not even eat a bite from that buffet. The kid only sat with us for goodness sakes!!!!! The manager and the security were so rude to us, they forced us to pay for  someone who did not even eat. They DECIEVED us!!!! Then we called one of the waitresses because they saw the girl did not even take a bite but guess what...SHE LIED and told the manager the little girl ate so we had to pay. They were acting as if I stole a biilion dollars from them. I will never go  there in my life anymore. The food is nothing but at least they need to respect the customers. The people working there are worst than the food. The manager was yelling at us in front of everyone for only  $35.They  said \"GET OUT,NEVER COME BACK!!!\" WE\"LL KICK YOU OUT FROM LAS VEGAS!!!\"How disrespectful is that...Its not fair beacuse the girl didnt even eat. So we just paid for her and left.",

We used to come to Vegas for the fabulous buffets , 99 cent shrimp cocktails, and the free drinks on the tables. Well at least the drinks are still \"theoretically free\"   haha. Now no one comes just for the buffets ,but rather the 5 star chefs restaurants located in the many ritzy hotels!   Ok every hotel has a buffet, some are really really big and others specialize in a few things like \"seafood\" or lobster .This buffet is not too big and offers a good selection of quality items. I don't need food from all over the world and a sample of every dish, however what i do want is quality dishes for what is put out. I found that the beef , prime rib, and the seafood (crab legs) were very good.  Aria even had an omelet bar for breakfast... a real plus!  I did try a little spanish rice and some pasta.... just for a taste and they were good too. I always have a little vegetables, salads, and various greens, and those were all quite exceptional. Now don't expect to get some fantastic service besides a few big  drinks, it is well worth the brunch price......champagne doesn't hurt either",

    "text": "I rate The Buffet at Aria 5 of 5 stars. As a frequent visitor to the Las Vegas Strip, my favorite hotel is the Aria at City Center. If you are looking for me, likely you will find me there. No, I'm not much into gambling, yes, I'm into the food, shows and things to see. The Buffet at Aria is my second favorite buffet behind The Buffet at Bellagio (which BTW, is a short tram ride from Aria). The Buffet at Aria is smaller than Bellagio with fewer choices, but (and it is a BIG BUT), the selections of food are great! They have exactly what I like to eat and I'm happy to eat everything they have. The merits of Aria's buffet are: a quick elevator ride from your room (rather than a 25 minute walk, ride, walk to Bellagio), shorter lines than Bellagio and quicker to fill your plate. So one strategy would be to do breakfast at Aria's buffet (a breakfast is a breakfast so no advantage to Bellagio buffet) then do dinner at one of Aria or Bellagio buffet. I highly recommend The Buffet at Aria!",

Some of the food was cold and some not that good.  But they have some items that was really good and the crab legs and shrimp is a good addition.  The drinks too a very long time to get to us.  We waited for about 5 minutes for a waiter to come over to get our drink order before we even went to get our food.  The drinks came when I was almost done with my first plate.  I hate not having something to drink while I eat.  But the facility is updated and looks nice.  Overall, it was what we expected.",

When my friends and I got to the Buffet line, at first I was bummed of how long the line was and that it might take forever to go through. But it went though pretty fast considering that there was 14 or 16 of us and they really accommodated us so we could seat together.   My Friends and I were there for brunch and they had great selection. There were Crab legs, sushi, lamb/ roast beef/ and another choice of meat, egg Benedict's, Mexican breakfast burritos, pizza, and alot of other food choice to get. Also their dessert was really good choices, the only dessert that I thought that was just okay was the Oreo cream dessert. I thought the way that they made the oreo dessert could of been better but there were alot of other choices of dessert that I was able to eat.   Now with the service was wonderful. The line to get though the paying and getting seated was really fast especially since there was 14 or 16 of us to be seated in the same area. The Cost of the type of food and choice was amazing. The totally that everyone paid was $30.30 per person; that included the tax and also tip ( you could get alcohol but it will cost a bit more). So I thought that was great, especially since we arrived there around 1ish and left around 3 pm. SO we were consuming food for roughly 2 hours and we got well over our moneys worth of food.  I would recommend this buffet to people that wants there money worth of good food.  YOu really can not pass up a buffet style food for $30.30 (inculding tax and tip), especially for the quality of the food.  The only thing that I dont know about this restruant if it is good for kids....just because there wasn't any kids with us and am not sure if there are a lot of selection of food for kids.",

It's all cold! How can a hotel that has so much money be an epic fail on their buffet? Don't get me wrong I love Aria but jesus christ all mighty. Use some of that money to teach some 101 of basic customer service to your employees for god sake. People don't want to spend a pretty penny on crap food and crap service. Oh and to top it off, my gf got FOOD POISONING. No wonder they offered a buy one get one free buffet. Do yourself a favor and go eat at the Wynn.",

There is some good food, and most of it is okay, but not really worth the long wait and the price they charge.  Also, the layout is really odd, with all of the food around the outer perimeter of the seating area.  Depending on where you sit, you may have to walk a long way to see it all.  I guess that's one way to burn off the calories.   Also, there are no self-serve drinks.  That may be okay for a place that isn't very crowded, but with the number of people they pump through these buffets, it doesn't cut it.",

There was an exceptional variety of food items from various cuisines around the world, including a whole steamed Red Snapper in the Chinese section.  I have never seen this offered before in any Las Vegas buffet.  The price was very reasonable at $36.95, which included unlimited wine and a whole steamed Maine Lobster for two people. (This offer is only available Friday-Sunday).  I must admit, however, that our lobster was overcooked and rubbery, except for the claw which was delicious.  But I give them credit for trying...  The dessert selection was also very good.  I especially liked the flan, which was light and refreshing.  Our attendant was very efficient at clearing away the used plates and replenishing our beverages.  I also liked the ambiance of this restaurant.  It's modern and upscale, with plenty of room to move around.",

I had brunch at The Buffet twice during my stay.  The space is clean and well-kept and the layout is much more straightforward than many other buffets on The Strip.  The selection, though, is relatively underwhelming compared to almost all other buffets I have been to (the lone exception being the smaller scale Cafe Lago in Caesar's Palace).  The taste of the food is about average--definitely a step above Wynn (the worst of the buffets I have visited) but not quite as good as Bellagio and Paris.  I would note, however, that the Eggs Benedict were a major disappointment, and I can't figure out how their \"only Tandoor Oven in a Las Vegas buffet\" comes into play.  Service was about par for the course--meaning too few servers trying to staff too many tables.",

The cool part was that for every two people, we get to share a maine lobster. The lobster was GOOD! However, the KING CRAB LEGS, were NOT. It was sooooo salty!! I even dipped it in butter to take away the saltiness, but I gave up after ONE plate. C'mon...I usually plates and plates of this!   Not only was the king crab legs salty, their weren't many choices for other types of food. I love all types of mash potatoes, and you can't really go wrong with that. However, their mash potatoes were still uncooked and also LOOKED uncooked. UGH. The only good thing about this place were their desserts.   For close to $40 including tip, I would NOT return here.",

However, they have apparently renovated and this buffet is like half the size, with less choices and not as fancy. My wife and I had a 2-for-1 coupon so it was worth it - but I wouldn't pay full price. As far as items: Italian section was poor, it was spaghetti and meatballs and chicken marsala and antipasta. Carving board was quite good with four different types of meat - mostly beef. sushi was eh. Mussels were great, escpecially new zealand mussels. Most everything was average. Deserts were OK. Waitress service was very good, always filled our drink. I would probably give 3 1/2 stars but cant. At 2-for-1 I like this place but not at full price.",

Aria Buffet is indeed overpriced, but it is good to come here right before 11am during the weekday to eat lunch for breakfast prices cause the breakfast price (~17) is too expensive for just breakfast food and the crabs and sushi comes out at 11am.   The Good:   Modern Chic Design and clean interiors.  The sushi (salmon/tuna nigiri) and several rolls are actually decent quality for a buffet.   The crabs are served cold, but you can hand your plate of crabs to a server behind the counter and they will steam it for you.  Garlic Naan Bread and curry dishes over jasmine rice is very good. Cuts of meats - Prime Rib, Pork Belly have always been good.  Desserts - Very good even though the selection may be small, I usually end up taking 3-4 cakes) Coffee is also quite good.  The line is usually shorter than most Buffets.   The Bad: Way too Expensive for Lunch, Dinners and Weekend Brunch.   Cashiers have always been quite rude.   Selection is small and there are no unique entrees.",

The one standout was their brisket; but alas, I just found out that it has been eliminated.  Also note that although lunch PRICING starts at 11am, they don't put out any beef until 1pm. So enjoy your sausage in the meantime :( I actually only ever came here to have the brisket.  My advice: For the same price, head to Bellagio, or Wynn. For $10 more, and infinitely better quality and selection, go to Caesar's Palace. I think the line there (and lack of line at Aria) speaks for itself.  Want to eat at Bellagio, but don't want to stand in the long line? MLife and Hyatt are partners. Since MLife stays also count as Hyatt stays, 5 stays at MLife hotels (including the cheap Excalibur) will earn you Platinum status with Hyatt. Platinum status at Hyatt can be matched to Gold status with MLife! Stand in the short buffet line! (Just don't do it at Aria!)",

    "text": "So when we moved here we were told for the best ayce buffet that had crab legs would be either Caesars palace or Aria. We ate at Caesars first because it had better reviews. It was out of this world amazing. Then a few weeks later we tried the Aria. It was awful in comparison. Not even close. The selection is limited, crab legs were over done and tiny, sushi was so old looking, salad bar was just tired and weak looking. Didn't even bother. Meat carving station looked great but I tried the turkey and it had a weird flavor. My husband had the prime rib and it was dry. When it came time for dessert they are smaller which is fine so we usually each get 3. I got 3 and my husband got 3 different ones. My daughter opted for the Gelato. All of our deserts were gross!! Just a waste of calories and waste of time for whomever is preparing them. Just so disappointing because they looked really good. The best one was the key lime pie tart thing but everything else was not good at all. Service was decent. Nothing too much to report on that. We spent a lot of money here and were very disappointed because we wanted to love it so much!!! Our daughters name is even Aria! I don't know if it was just an off day for the kitchen or we came at an off time (around 4:15) but I would pay around few bucks extra and go to Ceasers Palace anyday.",

    "text": "If the Aria buffet was located somewhere on it's own, I would probably rate it higher but with all the buffets located on the strip it comes in just average. The high price and the whole lining up for an hour even though it's empty inside is a bit of downer! I went early, around 4pm and didn't expect to be stuck in a 30 person queue for so long and to my dismay it was less than a third full when I got seated so I'm not sure what the holdup is for ? Make it look busy to passer by's ?  The food is pretty good though, crab legs were plentiful and there were plenty of hot seafood choices like boiled clams, fish and chips and jambalaya. They had an authentic tandoor oven which they were making fresh naan and tandoori chicken which was great, the chicken well marinated, moist and having the smokey oven scent. The roasts were nicely done and they even had slider burgers which were a nice touch.  The Chinese selection is a little bit small but decent, the satay chicken skewers were popular and the peanut sauce was nicely done. There were the usual fares of pizza, pastas and cold meats which I didn't indulge in.  Like most buffets, there was a large selection of desserts but the thing that stands out at the Aria buffet was the large selection of sorbet. Heaps of flavours to choose from stored in a rotating freezer which was pretty cool.  Service was great and efficient from the waiter but the fact that my waiter moved to a different section halfway through my meal made it hard to justify my tip as the second waiter had less to do by the time he took over with my table.  Would I come here again when in Vegas? Probably not - I think the new buffet at Caesars has this place well beat and Bellagio and Wynn probably rank higher than this one.",

    "text": "My family and I visited The Buffet at Aria on Labor Day for lunch. Due to it being a holiday weekend, they upped the prices to ~$40 per person. For the price, the food selections were sparse and plain.   The \"Indian\" section consisted of some naan and 3-4 different types of curries. The dishes lacked even a hint of the spicy fragrances that Indian dishes are known for. The \"Chinese\" section had some steaming baskets filled with \"dimsum,\" but the wrappers and dough were all mushy and unappealing.   The meat carving area offered a large variety of meats, including turkey, beef, and barbeque brisket. The brisket was dry and tasteless, even though we were there at just past 11AM. I shudder to think of what it tasted like at noon. Although we were there for lunch, they had a lot of breakfast options left, including cereal (Why?? I'm not paying $40 for cereal), bagels, waffles, french toast, and a custom omelet counter.   The desserts were lackluster and unimaginative. They had typical desserts you'd find in any normal buffet outside of Las Vegas, like chocolate cupcakes and plain cheesecake.   Service was mediocre, too. Our server took away my mom's bowl of soup that was still over halfway full without asking if she was done with it, and it took 3 requests until she brought us 2 (for the 4 of us) crab crackers. She was pretty much absent through much of the meal and we always had empty plates piled up on our table.   The only redeeming qualities at the buffet would be its beautiful natural lighting, the not-overly-salted crab legs, and the lack of lines. With all of the spectacular buffets and restaurants competing on The Strip, The Buffet at Aria really needs to step up its game.",

    "text": "I will give 3.5 stars if I can.   My boyfriend and I came here for Lunch on a weekday. There was a small line outside at the entrance but the line moved fairly fast. We were in line for less than 10 min. Upon seating, our Server Linda came to the table right away and took our drink orders. Unlike other buffets in town, if you are drinking any soft drinks, water, juice, coffee, they are already included in the price. For alcohol, there is an extra $12.99 which is also a good deal for all-you-can-drink beer and wine.   They have different stations at the buffet area for different cuisines, anything from Italian, French, American, Mexican,Asian, to seafood and desert. We started from the Beef Brisket, they give you a huge piece (good for the gentleman) and it is so tender and juicy. The fat and the lean meat are at a perfect ratio. One thing I was surprised that they didn't have is lamp chop, hopefully they can add that onto the menu soon.   Their salad bar is very extensive. A friendly staff is behind the counter and mix your salad right there for you with the fresh ingredients of your choice, and salad dressing of your choice of course. I am very impressed by this because you know it is not some old salad they premade and let it sit there overnight.   As for the Asian station, one thing I am not so satisfied is the sushi they offer. It is very simple cucumber roll and sushi with no-real-fish stuffing. But they do have sashimi and shrimp ceviche in a small cup to make it up :-) The Chinese food they offer is ok I will say, I had congee which is yummy and delicious but the dim sum is a little bit too dry. I dont think they made it themselves, probably from the box.   Seafood is my personal favourite, they have snow crab legs, clams, mussles (both on ice and in soup). I love it!   Last but not the least they have a great desert bar! 7 different kinds of icecream and all kind of different sweets! Perfect for the ones who have sweet tooth.   I heard they have wider and better selections for the weekend gourmet dinner. We will come back and check it out!",

There was very little in the way of food presentation and the large block lettering above the different stations labeling the type of food to be found there was very cafeteria like. Still, it did make everything easy to find. I did like the fact that they had a lot of ethnic offerings even though most were pretty bland. The food tasted like it had been sitting out for a while but that is to be expected at a buffet (can you tell I'm not a fan?). The service was decent but again my expectations were low. One thing I found extremely odd was that they didn't have fresh utensils available along with the clean plates.  I probably would not come here again based on the food but I gave them an extra star since the price if you have a players card is very reasonable. They also offer a $12.99 add on for unlimited alcoholic beverages. That's a great value though we did not partake on this visit.",

    "text": "Note of advice.. Do not come here if you've gone to the bacchanal buffet recently. I don't really think it was even worth the 31.99.   Coming here I was super excited to try the crab legs. The best part was that they had some that were warm. One thing I did love  were the shrimp in little cocktail glasses. Adorable. They were pretty darn good but overall I would not come back to this buffet just for that factor.  I wouldn't even call it a buffet. It has about half as many options as bellagio, wicked spoon, and bacchanal. The Latin section had maybe four options. Rice, green chile verde, asada burritos and these weird quesadilla things.   All the food was hard and disappointing. You could tell that it had been sitting under the lamps for way too long. The scallop potatoes were dry, not creamy and cold. The BBQ brisket slider was dry, the BBQ sauce disappeared into the bun and had hardly any meat. The mash potatoes were lacking something. Maybe salt? The max and cheese was good but def nothing special. I could whip something up similar in my own kitchen for my toddler.  The prime rib was very good though. Not too fatty and it was cooked just the way I enjoy it.. Medium rare. I actually went back for seconds. Another item that I thought was cool, was a pick your salad and they toss/make it for you. I liked that. I haven't seen that at other buffets. But honestly that was the only special item.   The desserts were blah, nothing special yet again except one item.. The lemon bars! Yum. Got to get the cope for those. The carrot cake was dry, had no raisins and had a pineapple salsa on the me plate that didn't pair well at all with it.   Overall a little disappointing but on a happy note they have unlimited drinks for 12.99. You can mix and change it up from sangria to white wint to beer to special drinks. That's a good deal and something to keep in mind.",

The split crab legs were a big draw but the sushi was spot on, fresh, delicious and beautifully displayed. I liked the salads esp the potato and crisp coleslaw. Garlic nan with tandoori chicken for lunch, where do you find that? 5-6 flavors of soft cookies, peanut butter blondies and over the top chocolate brownies. Gelato or sorbet to cleanse your palate.. I've never found a group of Yelpers more off target then in these reviews. They serve lunch till 4PM, that really worked for me. Give this place a try, I doubt you'll be disappointed.",

There's the standard fare here - snow crab legs, prime rib, omelette bar, ice creams, etc, but there was nothing that stood out to me and said \"I want to come here\". The waitress refilled drinks reasonably quickly and plates were removed faster enough as well. But...don't think I'll be coming back anytime soon.",

First the aria is a beautiful property so we thought the buffet would be awesome as well. We wanted to do a fine dining restaurant but the lines were long and some you needed a reservation. We should of looked at the lay out before we paid. Let's start at the meat station, they were carving hot dogs rolled in some sort of dough that. The salads at the salad station wasn't cold and the fish market had crayfish on Ice that wasn't seasoned. The only good thing about the crayfish was the chef cooking them for us and adding some more seasonings. I had to wait sometime because when I asked the cook he said let me get the chef. Didn't understand that when I saw him cooking fish on the grill already. But all in all it was probably better the chef cooked them anyway because I didn't see anyone washing there hands. The chef was very pleasing and paid close attention to our needs. Chef T was the high point of our experience there. Thanks a bunch. The desserts were the best thing they had going. By passed the Asian and Italian so I can't say much about those areas. Highly disappointed and would not return.",

    "text": "The entrance to the The Buffet at Aria sets the tone with clean space and minimal decor. Upon entering, patrons realize it's not just any buffet they are entering, but THE Buffet. Like a moth to the light, I was immediately drawn to the immecable presentation of the restaurant, the use of an unexpected yet friendly hue of orange, and the whole flow and functionality of the buffet line concept. Stations were distinctly set apart to separate genres of food, such as Indian, American, Asian, etc. The newness of the buffet is comforting. Unfortunately, I got the overall impression that the food did not quite compare to the decor and vibe of the restaurant. Not that there was anything faulty with the food, but it simply did not leave a lasting impression as one would expect from The Buffet at Aria. I liked the customer service and friendliness provided at the salad bar, where the server individually prepared my salad order with a kind and genuine smile. In terms of food, I quite enjoyed the raspberry sorbet and the chamomile tea, things I can easily get my hands on outside of an overpriced buffet environment. I can't say that this tarnishes my experience of buffets in Vegas, but it does make me wonder what the hype is all about. I'd rather dish the same amount of money, if not more, at a high-end restaurant where I'm paying for higher quality food and a more personal and enjoyable atmosphere. Just my two cents.",

It was pretty decent food, but i was expecting there to be more variety and selections due to the cost. 23 bucks for lunch!  I'm a huge dessert fan and I'm pretty picky with the desserts I eat. I would have to say, hands down, this buffet's desserts are pretty dam awesome. I was told the chef is pretty well known, and now I can see why. 5 stars for the desserts.  If you love desserts, fast service, and good food, this place is a must.   PS. The lighting in this place is pretty nice as well, the environment is fresh and comforting, and there's windows everywhere; if you're a windows person =)",

I was just severely underwhelmed by this buffet over and over again as I walked through the line SEARCHING for the reason I was paying $22 for lunch.  I usually can makeup for crap food in the desert area, but they kept giving me NOTHING.  Flan, was TERRIBLE...how do you eff up Flan?  Bananas Foster...  Syrupy Banana-y mess... Finally we tried the espresso shot...okay that was maybe 2 and half stars instead of zero.  I would never chance going back to this disaster and if you know what's good for you, bring a clif bar and keep your ass at the the tables.  At least then you have a chance of keeping your $20 bucks instead of immediately flushing it down the drain.  OH and I almost forgot...service WAS terrible!",

Buffets are a challenge with my \"Las Vegas Bootcamp\" eating regime. This one had several good choices. Fish/shellfish/steak/chicken/turkey/lamb -- every protein imaginable plus some standout vegetable options (broccolini, mixed veggies and more) and sauces galore. A bit spendier than the average buffet, but this is Aria and it was worth it.  I didn't even eat much and found it well worth the price tag. My husband tried the Indian food and really enjoyed it as well.   Side note: The decaf tea and coffee was also better than I've had at buffets.  Awesome service too.",

I love Aria buffet and after eating here at least a good dozen times, I can honestly recommend it to everybody. Unlike a lot of the buffets, here, it has a feeling of airiness. It's bright, inviting, and has a view of the Aria pools (which may or may not be good news).  When I'm getting down and stuffing my mouth, I don't want to feel claustrophobic or think the ceilings are about to cave in.  Every time I go it's packed, which is a good sign because food is constantly being replaced and made. I love the crab legs and if I had my way, I would be there all day.   The downside is that it's pricey for the amount of food available. Good thing MGM resorts always have those free buffet vouchers available! A good thing to remember is to check for promo codes online before you book at their properties. They let you eat at most of their buffets regardless of location. Aww yeah.",

The food quality was decent, but not amazing. The desserts were pretty, but not delicious. But nothing stood out as exemplary.   The seafood was okay, the carver slightly above average. Slabs of bacon, if that sort of thing appeals to you.   Personally, I'll stick with the Chinese dim sum mini-steamers and tikka masala.",

    "text": "Firstly, let me begin this review by stating how I judged this establishment. I looked at it as a buffet, meaning that you can't expect stellar service and world-class dishes but at the same time it's at Aria, meaning you would expect a little more than your average $8-all-you-can-eat extravaganza. That said, going off of these rough judging \"guidelines\", I have to say that The Buffet at Aria fell a little short of what I expected.   Now, let's start the actual review with the pricing. So we get there expecting to pay roughly $30 a head for lunch ($23-$25 +taxes). The lady asks how many of us is it and then begins ringing the first person up and it's like almost $50. Cool. There is an option to add unlimited alcoholic drinks for $12.99 so I figure she took it upon herself to imagine that we wanted that option and that once the taxes were added, that was the total. I just thought I would confirm that that's where the price came from before I paid. Nope, that wasn't the case. She explained that the base price was more because it was Chinese New Year and that there was an extra charge because there were eight of us at a table. We said ok, well we don't need to pay extra to be at one long table after paying extra for the New Year , we can just have two tables of four next to one another (the restaurant was not very busy at all). Nope, not an option. She explained that we would either be at a table of eight or be on opposite sides of the restaurant (she did all but say deliberately). Ok ma'am, you wanna play it like that, take the extra dollars and sit us together. It should be noted that we got to The Buffet after a wonderful morning at the hotel's spa which was well worth the considerable amount of money spent. That said, we had no problem spending roughly $50 a head for a buffet after the money spent at the spa but it was the principal that we took issue with.   Nevertheless, we were starved and once we got seated at our banquet table for eight, we went straight for the food. I started at the carving station which probably wasn't my greatest move given my feelings towards the staff from my encounter with the lady on the register. The man at the carving station acted like he had been there for two days straight without food or water - he was so notably unpleasant. That was the last bad encounter that I had with staff as the wait staff were all nice.   Ok, so about the food. As for the selection, there seemed to be no stone left unturned. There was cuisine from all corners of the globe with an assortment of dishes at each station. I really don't think there is any way to try them all, even though I would have liked to. Notable finds were the chicken in the Chinese section, the waffles, the pizza and of course the desserts. The salad bar was also extremely extensive all on its own. I would say that the quality of the food was pretty good in general. There were a few things that were a little lackluster like the American/ comfort food section (which is disappointing because I love that so much) but on average I would say the food was a good for buffet food.   One positive that is worth mentioning is the physical space. It is very bright, airy and spacious. I would say it surpasses other buffets in this area because it had a much better layout and therefore atmosphere than others that I've been to. A lot of time there are people bumping into one another and the place itself just feels like a jambalaya of people and food scents but this was not like that at all. I would go as far as to say that the physical space and atmosphere was the best part of the experience for me.   Overall, it was ok for what it was. I would suggest it if you're with a large group of people who all have different tastes and you happen to be at Aria, but I wouldn't go out of my way as I understand that most of the hotels have a buffet. If you're at Aria with a smaller group, I'd suggest trying one of their other restaurants as I know the hotel has better food offerings.",

When you think 5 star buffet, you should expect a grand spread, but I was disappointed  Ate here for breakfast and was not very impressed.  I would expect a much higher quality level of food from a 5 star resort such as the Aria.  Given how good Vegas buffets are in general, this was a bit of a disappointment.  Lunch was a bit better.  They had crab legs and steamed them for me to heat them up.  Also, they had a tandoor oven and were making fresh Naan, which was really nice.  The carved meats were dry and tough, so that wasn't too good.  Most of the food was pretty bland and easily forgotten.  Service was average.  The server was nice, but was not very attentive.",

However although the food is great, today we were greeted by the worst service ever and it felt like we were being discriminated against. We were here for brunch and got waitered by Flor de Maria, we have had her as a waitresss before and she was great but today it seemed like either she was having a bad day or whatever that when we kept asking for more drinks, she kept on looking at our time on the receipt and throwing the drinks basically. Will never be back at the Aria buffet, not matter how great the food is the service is what makes a place. Today was not an enjoyable experience.",

If you want mushy tasteless food, this is your spot.... They have an obscene amount of crab legs, so I think they use that to lure people in and pretty much don't give a crap about anything else.  And good luck trying to get someone to bring you a drink. Bottom line, avoid this place... even the coffee was terrible.  If you are looking for a real vegas buffet, head to the bellagio, it might be pricier but worth it. Gross.",

First of all, it's full price for a 4 year old, so they already robbed you there. Food quality is awful. Prime Rib was chewy, crab leg is too salty, and the rest of the food was barely interesting. What drove down the experience is our server Linda, accusing our nanny for drinking a glass of Orange juice and decided to call their manager on us. Can you imagine how rude and embarrassing that is coming from a server and they are suppose to represent a brand image of Aria Hotel? We had just spent $250 worth of brunch and they're going to lose that entire business over a glass of $.10 cents worth of orange juice.   Manager did come over and apologize but it's way too late to fix things.   Completely unprofessional! FAIL!!! Will never ever return!",

    "text": "After a late night, and not much sleep we all decided that a good breakfast was in order. So we walked over toThe Buffet at the beautiful Aria Resort and Casino which was right across from our hotel the Vdara.   I noticed many of the reviews listed are for the dinner buffet, keep in mind this review is for the breakfast buffet.   The moment we arrived, i noticed quite a long lineup which lead me to believe two things, either its a very good buffet and its super busy, or the service was going to be bad. Well has it turned out (luckily) it was the first point. We waited for about 15mins before we were seated, not bad at all. You have to pay first before you can enter and the cost was 15.95! I was stunned, that is an amazing price for the breakfast experience I was about to have.   The Buffet is an open concept and bright space. The decor was very \" vegas\" in that it was chic and the consistent elements from outside the hotel were carried inside. Since the Aria itself is quite new in Vegas it was very modern and this translated to the decor inside. The tables were spaced out well, so that i didn't have others staring at my plate to see what I got. :)   The service was excellent. The lady that served our table was very attentive, friendly, and made some great suggestions on what to get.   The buffet itself was laid out quite well. You had lots of room to maneuver around to get to the food you want. But with this place, trust me you will want everything.   The food was fresh, you had your standard fare of eggs, bacon, potatoes etc, but you also had many unique dishes. Too many to list here.. The omelets are amazing...the Portuguese sausage..yum...they also had some chinese items in the buffet..the cakes..the fruit..you name it..it was amazing.   If your in Vegas and want a great breakfast buffet..you gotta try this place...forget the Bellagio breakfast buffet..its over hyped..food not as fresh.overpriced...but that is for another review..;)",

I will come back whenever I'm in Vegas from now on. We had multiple people tell us that Aria's buffet didn't compare to others on the strip (namely Bellagio) so we went to see for ourselves and we were not impressed. The buffet at Aria blew all others out of the water! We actually opted to eat here twice during our stay because we were so happy with it. No obnoxious lines, friendly staff who kept the drinks coming and our table clean. We mainly filled up on crab, seafood & the meat carving station but everything we tried was great. Very fresh and very tasty. The dessert bar was impressive with some very unique and delicious gelato flavors to try. I can't wait to come back and bring my mom because she will be blown away. Much love to the buffet at Aria, you guys are the bomb!!",

In fact, for the price you pay, I'd rather go to \"those\" kinda buffets for half the price....at least, you're not expecting much.  I went for brunch. And maybe, I'm an idiot but, they should serve BRUNCH. All the brunch I really saw was the breakfast foods, eggs benedict, and mimosas.  The Chinese food was HORRIBLE. Might as well go to Panda Express but, the difference is Panda's beef broccoli tastes good. The broccoli wasn't fully cooked and the beef was cooked too much....practically fried.  Sushi sucked. Although what can you really expect from buffet sushi, right.  Pizza sucked. I'd rather have those frozen pizzas you make at home!  Even the desert bar wasn't too crackin'...I mean, you have all the flavors of ice cream/yogurt/whatevs BUT, CHOCOLATE. Ughhh, fail. You gotta have chocolate...it's a staple!

There was sushi, endless shrimp and crab legs, muscles, clams, crawfish, oysters...all delicious. There was an olive, meat, and cheese area. Thought I died and went to heaven. I was able to try out some Mediteranian food which I'd never had before. The list goes on and on.  Our waitress was quick to replenish drinks and wisk away dirty plates. She was also very good natured which can make or break any dining experience.  The dessert portion was meh but I'm not a huge dessert person.   We had a 2 for 1 coupon which helped keep costs down. We ended up paying just under $20 each. It is a costly buffet but well worth it. I'm dreaming about the day we can go back.",

They have a stations featuring a selection of cuisines, all done well, Asian, Italian, Indian, Latin, etc.  Some really surprisingly good choices were things like the mushroom polenta, the Brussels sprouts with bacon, and the cured salami.    I then like the focus in on the seafood, which they have a nice variety of here.  They were grilling up mahi mahi and swordfish so I got both of these, excellent.  Also had plenty of NZ green mussels, and the crab legs - which are pre-split for you, saving a lot of work.    Save room for dessert!  A huge dessert selection, loved the raspberry panna cotta and the flan the most.  Also, the have a good selection of gelato.

The staff is very friendly but when it gets busy they ignore you a bit.  Unlike what a previous review said you start off with king crab legs/shrimp now (I went a day before and the crab/shrimp were at the end)... the shrimp is what I expect it to be for paying $30 and the crab is just alright.  Ask them to steam the crab!!! Important! It tastes much better + the butter.  There's sushi... avoid the nigiri (or rice + very little sashimi).  The fish isnt really what I expected.  Some of the sushi is alright.  I really liked the spider rolls.  There is a carvery station with turkey, flank steak, and prime rib (depending on the hour/day) they mix it up.  An Indian section with goat/curry/hummus/etc.  Then there is an Asian section where you can get won-ton noodles upon request (not too bad but I could get one near my house for 5 bucks).  They have a good asian carvery (One night was good peking duck and the next day was cantonese BBQ Pork).    There isnt really much of a fruit selection.  Then there's the dessert section.  The best part, honestly.  TRY THE CARROT CAKE! It's pretty good, not too sweet and well presented.  The Gelato and Macaroons are pretty good too!  Overall, it's a decent place.  Not amazing or anything and a little pricey.",

    "text": "There's no doubt that other than gambling, you can't leave Vegas without having a buffet. However, the heydeys of Vegas are long gone with the cheap AND delicious buffets. Now everything is classed up and they come with a hefty price tag. This includes the buffet at Aria. For $56 for a dinner buffet, I have to say it was most expensive and disappointing buffet I've been to in Vegas. The place looks like they have a lot of variety but half of it are not what I would crave for at a buffet. I ended up mostly getting stuff from the Asian cuisine but even that was lacking. The dumplings/ dim sum looked like they have been picked through. The shrimp pad thai didn't have much flavor to it. I didn't try it but the the tandoori chicken was overcooked according to my friends. The best one was probably the mac n cheese drenched in truffle oil. Comes in a little iron cast dish, which could be a meal in itself. But overall, it was not worth the money. I would have rather eaten at McDs instead if only we weren't starving.",

Ages 3 and below are free, every age above that pays the same price. Otherwise, I'm so happy that we payed the pretty penny to be able to eat here for dinner. The complementary lobster was amazing and all the adults had complementary merlot as well.   I personally enjoyed the freshly made naan (Indian sort of \"tortilla\"), the American side dishes including gluten-free baby carrots and roasted asparagus, and the Margarita pizza. Lastly, their dessert selection with their cakes aren't like most buffets I've been to - the presentation was gorgeous for each cake or pie. On top of that, the buffet in general had a wide selection of international foods which I really enjoyed. One thing though - fix up your sushi selection for us sushi lovers, please :) I only had one piece of a california roll and even that didn't even really suffice. I was a little disappointed but everything else made up for it!  In all, 4 stars because that price to pay if you're only 18 years of age such as myself isn't fully worth it. I had a great time though! Our server was so nice, and not to mention the moist towels which were aloe infused and reusable was a very nice touch.",

With that, I surmise that its open floor-plan buffet dining room is aptly designed, resembling a mid-sized Silicon Valley tech company cafeteria or a strip mall's Todai.  This is not a compliment.  The food here mirrors the aesthetic; nothing stands out.  Everything is rigidly assembled without any artful flair similar to lesser off-strip buffets.  The seafood and meat selections here are dry, while the salad bar is just average.  This is made exponentially worse by the fact that the buffet items are limited.    The stand-out section, however, is their dessert bar and gelato.  Though half of the pickings here are highly flawed to inedible, the other half may satisfy your sweet tooth to some extent.    Though I have only been here twice, I must say that the wait and bus staff are friendly -- but, unfortunately, understaffed to be fully attentive.",

On Friday and Saturday nights they offer lobster for two and unlimited wine with your dinner so ASK about it if they don't offer it to you.   Food:  There are some stations like the meat carving station, pasta station, and the dessert station that I should just stay away from they ALWAYS have good stuff happening there. You can have any kinda pasta made which is a delicious carb nightmare. The desserts always seem so fancy but they also have an ice cream and gelato bar! That with homemade cookies or either bread pudding and cobbler hits it home.   Service: This is hit and miss. Sometimes you can be seated in an area where the waitress is cool and attentive. There are other times when you have to go on a search and rescue mission just to get a drink refill.   I will keep coming here because I have yet to have a bad experience.

The fresh naan was excellent, and the chicken curry could use a little more kick. I did like the pork belly. The waffles and red velvet pancakes were fine. For $29, I was happy with the experience. The server was prompt with drinks, but we sometimes had to bus our own plates because they were so busy. Prime rib looked good but I was already full.

I had experienced other Vegas Buffets at this point and was so excited to see what the Aria had to offer. The buffet unfortunately did not match what i was expecting. They Hotel and casino are so nice! It seems so upscale and the buffet just wasn't. Our service wasn't Either. Our plates were never cleared from our table, we had to ask for refills, and our server was not overly pleasant. Don't get me wrong, there were a lot of things we really enjoyed. The buffet offered a lot of options from all over the world. The food just wasn't great. It was standard buffet quality food. If i sound crazy i apologize. I know that its a buffet, but the Aria is anything but standard. So why would their buffet be? My wife didn't seem to \"love\" anything. She had two disappointing plates with loads of wasted food. I tried sampling as much as i could to get the most of my experience and really was underwhelmed by everything, Besides the desserts of course. We both really enjoyed all of the desserts we tried. We left satisfied with our meal because of how great the desserts were. I think if i were to come back to the Aria's buffet it would be for dinner, hoping that they do a better dinner than they do lunch. But with all that Vegas has to offer i most likely wont return because I will be more inclined to try somewhere new.",

The only reason I gave 2 stars because our waiter was pretty nice and fun to talk to.  However, the guy at the door where you pay was a jerk. We got the bottomless deal from a lady cashier at the door. But she forgot to give us wrist bands( they can't serve us drinks without the wrist bands). When I waited at the table, our waitress informed us about the wrist bands. Then I went to the front again to ask for 2 wrist bands with the receipt in my hands. The lady cashier was gone at the time, and it was that jerk who was on duty. So I showed him the receipts, and told him what happened. He looked at the receipt and said: I can only give you one wrist band, you have to bring the other party to the front to get his. I told him we started eating 30 mins ago and didn't even get any drinks, and now you want me to bring the other party to the front when you guys forgot to give them to us in the first place?! His answer to me was hey I didn't sell the ticket to you, it was not my problem.   Umm I thought in Vegas is all about service. I understand it was you didn't sell me the ticket and it wasn't your fault, but you work here. You supposed to solve the problem, not make it worse just because it wasn't your fault. I probably would made my company to come to the front to get the wrist band had he said anything other than what was said to us.   I am a business owner myself, and I know if my employees ever make such comments, he or she will be the first one to let go when the annual evaluation comes up. It is not about making the mistakes, it's about the mentality/attitude after the mistake occurs.   To sum up, 2 things will not make me to come back. 1, the food quality does not worth the price, even with the crab legs and lobsters(you can get better quality seafood at Costco with the same price  you pay here, and steaks/lamb rack as well, or just go try Bacchanal at Caesar). Noted, I said food quality. The restaurant made me feel messy and unclean. I guess it was the presentation of the food, and the quality of the seafood and meat. The table at the seafood section appeared to be very dirty and messy. Compare to all other buffets in Vegas, I think they did a bad job at presentation and clean up. The soup is always luke warm, or may be because I was placed at the further end of the table and I walk slow. Who knows?  The Asian food section looks super greasy and unappetizing because they let the food sit there forever without stirring it over. 2, the service really left a bad taste in my mouth.  I regret I didn't get the name of the guy at the front, but I was there on 11/24 somewhere from 6pm-8pm. The older Asian lady at the cashier was very nice, and the jerk might be the the one that was taking over her shift.",

    "text": "My wife and I searched quite a while to find the buffet where we would eat during our short, recent stay in Las Vegas. We decided on the Aria.  Several reviews and sites state that on Sunday, the Aria offers a champagne brunch. This is partially True. When you arrive, you pay the $30.99 plus tax for the buffet. After seated, you are offered the \"opportunity\" to add the champagne - $16.99 plus tax for unlimited. So if expecting a champagne buffet, this one will set you back $48 plus tax and tip.  We arrived at 2:15 and asked FOR A SEAT NEAR A WINDOW WITH A POOL VIEW.  The food was average. The prime rib was good. The shrimp was victim to sitting too long at room temp - mushy. The paella was simply dreadful. I took 3 bites - all 3 included shells from crab. Definitely skip this! The gelato was decent - however, the oreo-type cookie I also had was quite tasteless, although it looked like it should be great.  Then came the worst part of the experience. After being there 30 minutes or so, the blinds were lowered so there was no longer a view outside. We asked it be raised as we specifically asked for a table with an outside view. It was raised a couple of feet. A few minutes later, it was again lowered to the sill. I asked for a manager. She \"explained\" someone complained that they were bothered by the sun. I asked that it be raised to just above eye level so we could enjoy our view. The manager declined. She told us we could move. ???????????? Why not ask the guests that came in after we did, and who do not want an outside view to move????????   ok - so we moved so we could continue to enjoy the outside view. While finishing our dessert, we were brought our bill and asked to pay at that time for our champagne. No - we could not finish our dessert first, we needed to produce our credit card and pay-up.  I am convinced this was age-discrimination on the part of the manager. She felt we, as seniors, should \"go quietly into the night\". That was quite apparent during our conversation and her \"talking down\" to us.  Well - guess what - that's not going to happen. I will do whatever I can to share our unpleasant experience with the Aria.  (Note that we stayed at the Aria in July - 2 months prior to this visit. We had a terrific experience at that time.)  There are many buffet options in Las Vegas. My strong suggestion is to find one elsewhere.  *********************************************************************** I have subsequently been in contact with the Aria regarding this visit.  That conversation was professional and fair.  I will revisit the buffet upon our return and hope the feedback has led to changes - particularly with the manager we dealt with.",

I had brunch/lunch here and it was mediocre at best. It was about $40 a person because there's a 18% gratuity charge for parties over 6 or 8 (I can't remember). If you wanted to do bottomless mimosas/wine/champagne, then that's an additional $16.99 from what I can remember.   Although the buffet itself has a wide variety of cuisines, the selection felt a bit limited and repetitive.   The wonton soup here is good! The wontons it self are delicious, and they don't skimp on the filling like regular buffets, however the broth itself was FAR TOOO SALTY. I felt like I was just gulping down spoonfuls of salt...so I just finished the wontons and left it at that.   I also really enjoyed the pizza, because the crust was thin, and the cheese to dough ratio was perfect. However, everything else didn't really stand out.   The best part of this buffet would probably have to be its desserts section. There is a rotating gelato/ice cream thing and my friends and I were so mesmerized by it. And the pistachio, carmel macchiato, and citrus flavors were sooooo good. I also liked that they had Thai Tea in cute little bottles and specialty juices like strawberry lemonade and pom juice.   Other than that, there's really nothing exceptional about this buffet. I have no point of reference to compare it to the other buffets in Vegas, but from what my friends who were there told me, they preferred the Wicked Spoon over this.",

This buffet separates their food into sections, there's a dessert bar, seafood section, Asian food section, American food section, strictly meat cut section, and more! They had a \"crest your own pho soup\" station that I thought was really cute. Their dumpling station was fully stocked and I could see them rotating each batch every several minutes to ensure the food was still soft instead of hard/ unflavorful. The best part - CRAB LEGS, they always had a fresh batch out and I went for thirds! This buffet clearly keeps their food rotating and ensuring they're serving good food for the customers. The best buffet I have ever been to by far. You get discounts for being a local in Las Vegas or having an 'M Life' card.",

At one point I thought I was lost and somehow ended up at one of the Station Casino buffets.  Good things: Lots of crab legs- served hot & cold. They also had mussels, clams, and shrimp as well.  The types of food they offered were: Diner- American far, Salad, Seafood, Mediterranean, Italian, Asian,  a carving station and dessert. Honestly not one dish stood out. The prime rib was dry and tough, the beef rib was pretty much pure fat, the asian food was just sad.  I would probably eat here again maybe for lunch when the price isn't as steep. But for dinner I would rather go next door to Wicked Spoon or drive down the street to Bacchanal.",

Best way to fill up your belly and your drinking needs!   Make sure you go with an empty tummy. The buffet line has a huge spread-- seafood, sushi, prime rib, pasta, pizza...and more. I have a sweet tooth so the their dessert section made me very happy--gelato, bananas foster, cheesecake and cream cakes...lets just say I was in heaven :)   Initially the service was really slow. It took us a good 10 minutes to pay and to be seated. They only had a few hostesses working with a line of 50+. I felt really bad for our server who was basically waiting on half of the tables in the whole restaurant. But it was amazing to see how she memorized all the drinks that the table next to us ordered (let's just say they were a very demanding group).   The food was fresh and very tasty. I would definitely go back on my next visit to Vegas!",

The presentation for the chicken and waffles was beautiful. There was a little fry basket lined with paper and it had mini waffles and chicken tenders/nuggets inside. Perfectly portioned and cute to boot. Did I mention the dessert station?  Minus a star for some food looking like it needed to be stirred. Also the person who is responsible for writing the food names on the signs needs an English class desperately.  Maybe it was purposeful, but I don't think so.",

After looking at everything they had to offer and seeing all of the seafood they had out I thought id get a plate of crab legs. I watched the chef bring them out and put them on the steam plate that they had so I knew they were fresh. During the day I felt fine and had nothing else to eat or drink (just bottled water). Fast forward to 8 p.m. when I knew I had FOOD POISONING and was getting sick on my hotel bathroom floor. After being up all night now I have to catch my flight back home. First thing I did when I landed was go to the ER for SEVERE FOOD POISONING where I had been overnight. It has now been 3 days and am on medications trying to get rid of whatever I picked up from this buffet.",

I looked it up on their website and saw that tonight was 'gourmet dinner' night. I wanted to know more of what that was so I decided to call and ask what exactly consists of this 'gourmet dinner'. The woman on the phone told me it's the best buffet with the best prime rib and huge king crab legs. We were sold. We live on the opposite side of town so it took us about 30 min to get there. Get to the buffet around 5:30 and it's pretty empty. There was a large party in front of us of about 9 and they were busy getting their table ready. Meanwhile the hostess was just standing there. She could have sat my party of 3 while they were getting their table ready. So we finally get seated and go to get our food. First, there was no prime rib. Half of the food there is Indian themed, and to top it off. There was NO KING CRAB LEGS. They were snow crabs!! They were seriously so small that it was almost a joke. This buffet cost us about $140 for 3. I was furious. We drove 30 minutes for KING crab legs that they specified they had, and they didn't. So we get back to the table and we're waiting for the waitress to come and take our drink order. And we're waiting, and waiting. About 15 min later she comes by to take our drink order. I was so fed up I looked at my parents and I said stop eating. This isn't worth $40 a person. So I asked the waitress for the manager. Which took her a good while to track her down. The manager comes over and I tell her this buffet is not worth the money and you guys are Falsely advertising KING crab legs when they are in fact snow crabs. I told her we wanted our money back. She didn't even hesitate. She just said sure follow me. By her not hesitating to give us a refund makes me wonder how many other people complained. She must have been used to it. We should have known by how empty the buffet was. We were obviously mad, and starving at this point. So we get our car that we valeted and we're told we had to pay $13 for parking! We weren't even in there for 30 min and had to pay. They should have had a sign out saying this is how much parking is. Overall this buffet is horrible. If you're looking for a good buffet, bacchanal is where it's at. For $20 more a person at least you know you're getting your money's worth.",

The quality of the food was great and well seasoned, unlike the typical unseasoned buffet food other hotels offer. Their sea food is what really sold me as well as the huge dessert corner which includes creme brulee, gelato with multiple flavors, cheesecake, and other desserts. The service was good, other than having to ask the waiter for water three times. You get what you pay for.",

Had I known that the flavor would be bland across the board I wouldve just stuck with crab legs and dessert... those were the only things that I was actually excited about. Everything else could have been served at a Golden Corral and I wouldn't have known the difference. Bland...and/or dry... and/or folks trying to be clever with cooking foods that are better left keeping it simple.  The turkey wasn't too horrible... but it wasn't good enough that I felt the need to try the other meats they had to offer..which wasn't much if I recall correctly. The mashed potatoes were bland. I had been craving pots mashed, too... so that really got me down. They had some fancy macaroni that just didn't do it for me. Perhaps I'm too country for Aria's buffet... but come on... what's a buffet without good ol' macaroni and cheese?! If you want crab legs mid week...swing through here.. if you don't mind dropping about $40. We had a comp for a BOGO free dinner buffet (MyVegas game on Facebook) so that's what got us in...but I think that after leaving there...we will not be returning.",

    "text": "First time eating here and it was, sadly, a let down. The Buffet at ARIA has two solid things going for it. The price is quite attractive at $39.99 per person (not sure if that includes sodas as I've weaned myself off them lately and stuck with water). The other plus is the environment. It's simply a nice place to be.   The cons include the actual food and the hour wait. The pho wasn't very good. The \"steak\" was dry. The fish was way too salty. The pork buns were sad. The sushi rolls were like the ones you get at a local grocery store made by Bob or Bill. Nothing was very good.   I kept wanting to convince myself the food tastes better than it is. After walking around for an hour I wanted it to be better. Truly I did but... it isn't. To be fair, the Indian dishes were quite acceptable.   Overall, they're trying to do too many things - Chinese, Mexican, American, Japanese, Indian, Vietnamese... and so on. The end result is nothing is excellent and nothing made me want to take more than a couple bites. On the surface this place looks like amazing value but my recommendation is to skip the Vegas buffet dinner. Get yourself a nice delicious entree at a great restaurant.   Other notes: we walked from a different hotel so not sure how parking works if you're staying away from the main strip. I didn't try the Mexican food nor the desserts.",

When you are younger and can burn tons of calories by simply chewing a gum for fifteen minutes, then the \"volume\" may be more attractive to you. But when you are older and must run 5 miles to burn a couple of hundreds of measly calories, it becomes all about quality! Basically if you are going to take on more calories, it better be worth it!  With that said, Aria's buffet is one of the better ones I have been to in Vegas. You have your typical choices of Italian, Chinese, American etc. dishes, but the quality is somewhat better.

    "text": "Aria.  Yes, the Aria buffet is by far at the top of any Best Seafood Buffets in Vegas list.  If you go for any regular week-day lunch (around 26 dollars + tax) you will be delighted by the variety of seafood available, including good quality crab legs, craw fish, shrimps, high-quality & gourmet-style fish tacos, and several good fish dishes.  Moreover, the price of this Vegas all-you-can-eat is reasonable, especially considering the quality of most dishes served.    As per the actual food served, Aria tends to be a 'gourmet' buffet and not for everybody's palate. If all you care about is average hot-dogs, burgers and average Macaroni & Cheese, Aria may not be for you.  Not everybody has worldly taste-buds, not everybody wants to taste a variety of interesting, higher-end dishes from all over the world. For example, they serve the best Pho (Vietnamese soup) of any Vegas buffet and the best, most authentic pasta of any buffets I ate at in Vegas.  They also serve excellent Indian curries and great naan breads.  But not everybody appreciates 'Pho' and not everybody is even aware of what authentic Italian pasta dishes are like or taste like (but I am, and I can't stomach some of the garbage that's served at some buffets, as if the pasta came out of a can).  Moreover, health-conscious eaters will find plenty of great options.  What makes Aria one of the best 5 buffets in Vegas  if not the very best  is that the flavors and the texture of the wide range of dishes they serve is of high quality (for a buffet).  Aria Buffet Review: Ambiance. You'll find it outstanding, if you like modern, bright and airy!  It can be very busy, though. The whole resort is beautiful, huge, airy and modern.  aria buffet review vegasThe buffet is beautifully designed, winner of several 'eco-friendly' awards; what you would expect if you went to a high-end, beautiful, huge restaurant, which happens to serve all-you-can-eat dishes.  You will love the space, the huge glass walls overlooking onto the Aria's fabulous, eco-friendly pool and Jacuzzi areas, you will appreciate the brand new modern decor. You will never wait for a table to clear here, unless they close several sections.",

They had a ton of choices at the meat carving station including brisket.  They offer different types of food I haven't seen at other buffets.  That gave us a chance to try new foods we wouldn't have tried otherwise.  I also enjoyed the desserts in comparison to other buffets.  I would recommend this buffet!

Let me start by saying there was nothing really wrong with my experience here but seeing as Aria is considered one of the nicer hotels and casinos to stay at, I expected their buffet to be on the same level as some of the other dining options located in the hotel. It unfortunately was not! Ended up coming right as the lunch and dinner menu was changing hoping to get a little of both worlds but didn't really see much of a difference in what was being served!  The buffet itself is very nice and clean but really just lacked variety. A good example was the Asian section. There were noodles and rice and soups and a few appitizers but there were no protein choices! Normally thered be chicken or beef or some sort of seafood but there was literally nothing to choose from.  Just thinking about each section is racking my brain trying to write about it but for as many passes as I made, it saddens me that I spent $45 to ultimately eat stuff that I could have eaten at any buffet in vegas for half the price.  Honestly what came to mind as I was walking through each area was...  \"This reminds me of a fancy Home Town Buffet\" And for that to come to mind at an establishment like Aria says a lot! I know buffets are a thing in Vegas and competition is fierce but just based off of what I experienced here, I'm gonna have to stick to what I know is good and go to where I usually go which is Wicked Spoon! Now that's a top notch buffet that will never disappoint!",

There were Asian noodles thou which were pretty good. The salad bar was a little boring. No sushi. There was salmon and that was pretty good too.   My favorite was the Mediterranean section. They had a lot of curry options to choose from. They had a good selection of ice cream with an option of the cutest small waffle cone.   Overall it's not super expensive for what they give.

The Hawaiian poke bowl is the best I have had, including while in Hawaii.  Clams, 2 kinds of mussels, shrimp and crab legs were plentiful.  There were no raw oysters, which is ok.

My personal favorites being the seafood of course (snow crab over all others by far) and then the carving station which had amazing beef ribs and pork belly. The service was superb. Drinks were okay, the lemonade was great. Asian far was lacking in flavor imo but the Mexican food was good. Overall I'm happy with the experience. Would probably not recommend if you aren't going to either having seafood or the carving station though as it likely won't be worth the $40 price tag.",

There was mac and cheese next to scrambled eggs, they had stuff out for the Asian soups but the soups had plastic wrap over them, etc. Everything was just okay. I'm thinking my $30 would have been better spent somewhere else. The best thing I ate here was the kielbasa and IPA sausage (bratwurst infused with IPA and cheese).   Also the hostess stand/cashier area was the worst. There were separate lines for M Life rewards members and the general public. There was a dedicated line for tier pearl and above. We stood in that M Life line since we have the platinum membership, and it was shorter. The line did NOT move. People walking into the general line after us were able to pay and get sat before us. Also they didn't even check to see if you had an M Life card at all. Why have separate lines? What's worse, even after we paid, we still had to wait. We watched while even more new patrons arrived, paid and got sat before us again. Now we know. Just get in the line that moves the fastest.  2 stars because our server was pleasant and attentive, and they had a lot vegetarian/vegan options for my husband.",

But the food was not fresh, the service was poor and there was nothing to eat. I won't come back. I hope you don't come again. Parsley and Onions are black and dry. I never knew Las Vegas had such a bad buffet.n",

    "text": "This is so hard - I want this place to be amazing but it keeps falling short.   We'll start with the welcome - or lack thereof.  We visited for Breakfast on Sunday morning where you pay a premium.  The dining room was maybe 1/4 full.  We charged the 2 breakfast's to our room at the Bellagio, which was extremely uneventful.  Quick with little conversation or acknowledgement.    Then we wait in a line with 1 person in front of us.  And we wait. And wait.  Looking at all the empty tables and a couple bussers who appeared to be taking there time cleaning off the tables where people had just left.  I could tell only one section was open.  There was a lady standing near us who seemed oblivious to the fact a line was growing on both sides (Premium and non-premium guests).  The guy in front of us finally had it, jumped over the rope to ask the lady less then 10 feet away when we could get seated.  She snapped (and I mean snapped) at him in a few minutes.  Another person asked - and again with very pissy attitude - came back with \"we're short handed - just wait\".  WOW!  Never seen someone so rude.  Put everyone in line in a fowl mood after witnessing that.  We almost asked for our money back to go somewhere else.   Finally though - we were seated.    Now our server was incredible!  She was moving with the sense of purpose and doing her best to accomplish what needed to be done to serve her guests.  Total 180 from before.  I had a diet coke (I'm not a coffee drinker so get my caffeine from other sources) and she brought a small pitcher knowing that they were busy and shorthanded so refills may not come as quickly as needed.  Good job.  Now onto the food.  It was OK.  But honestly - couldn't tell the difference between a normal breakfast and brunch.  There honestly was nothing special.    Overall, a disappointing experience compared to other MGM properties.",

My husband and I eat fish but there was hardly any fish to speak of. I had expected grilled fish that they would make for you, but no one was at the counter the whole time we were there and there wasn't any such choices either. There was however, a really sorry looking poke bar which was a mess and totally grossed me out. With no condiments in sight, I gladly gave this a miss.  Asian food - Lots of meat, one shrimp option per the noodle soup which was actually pretty tasty after I spiced it up. Italian - no gluten or dairy free options on the pizza's but there was thankfully gluten free pasta. I don't think I've ever been to a buffet (as expensive as this - $134 for two people with tip) and eaten fish and chips and pizza. Indian food - 4 very messy and sorry looking curries with no seafood options. No thank you - I wouldn't eat that garbage if you paid me! Mexican - chips weren't refilled, there was again no seafood options and no tacos in sight. Other than the great desserts (none of which were gluten and dairy free, so my husband couldn't have anything), this buffet was a total cluster. Aria should be ashamed of themselves. Do yourselves a favor, and go elsewhere like Mandalay Bay or the Wynn. Or save your money and go shopping instead!",

We went for Mother's Day and there was nobody in line to pay. However, in spite of the fact that half the tables were available, we still waited 20 minutes to be seated and another 30 to be served anything to drink. The food was good but waiting for tables that were already empty??? We went again the next day and had the same experience. Many tables available yet there was a line of people waiting for at least 30 minutes to be seated. This makes no sense when it is a buffet.",

I'd say the strength is on their desserts, so many to choose from and all so beautiful sometimes you can find a macaron bar 2. Gelato flavors are abundant; this was always a must do  3.

This buffet is pretty big and has a wide variety of foods (Asian, Mediterranean, Carvery, Mexican, Italian, etc.). There is also a tiny section categorized as a Children's Table.   The Carvery section has lamb chops!! Other buffets at this price usually just have 2-3 types of meat to offer. They sometimes only give you 2 pieces at a time though, depending on how busy they are.  They have a large section for their seafood - sushi, baked seafood, shrimp, mussels, etc. The crab legs taste amazing and the cold crab legs are usually already broken in half so it's easy to get the meat. Unfortunately, the crawfish wasn't that good and didn't taste fresh. I have yet to find a buffet in Vegas that has quality oysters - this buffet is a hit or miss with their oysters. Tonight, it was a miss.  If you're going to make your own pho, definitely take advantage of the extra toppings that they have right next to it. The broth is very bland.  Lastly, desserts. My favorites are the creme brulee, flan, fruity pebble rice krispies, and the ice cream. They also have mochi ice cream too! I wish I wasn't so full already so I could have tried more desserts.",

I ended up at the Aria for lunch as a consolation prize.   There was no wait, and all of the staff were extremely helpful and friendly, including the checkout counter and the waitresses. They even let me in to look around before I committed to eating there.   My big draw was the fresh seafood. I went straight for the streamed crab legs, only to find them overcooked and flavorless. They had tools to crack the shells, but no crab forks meaning my hands got absolutely filthy.   The chilled blue crabs were better, but were extremely difficult to eat because they didn't offer crab forks. The cocktail shrimp were just ok, nothing special.   The rest of the food at the buffet was varying levels of mediocre, and the price was steep. I'd skip this place and go somewhere else.",

Interesting you might wonder if some left over food were being recycled and made into some other dishes... like steak, you will find at another corner, steak salad, but those meat were stale...  The Spanish rice and chili Verde were okay.  I am sorry to say all these but that was what I have seen.  We ordered ice water and sprite, and there was a weird chemical taste in them....  For the dessert, nothing much appealing that makes you want for a second round. No real great desserts, not even macaroons... sad, even the most simple cookies that I wanted to give a last chance were hard and tasted like they had been out for a while... seriously  I don't usually write review, but this is just too disappointing to see in a big hotel...

The rum punch and cranberry spritzer was pretty good!  We both enjoyed the food selection here.  They may not have the vast variety as other popular buffets, but I liked that what they did offer was well executed.  My favorite was the Indian chicken curry and naan bread.  The build your own pho was pretty good too.  We'll definitely come back!",

Everything seemed so close together it was hard to maneuver around other guest.   I did however like their Curry Chicken and my husband said the lamb chops were delicious. They offer a bottomless drink (Wine/beer/cocktails) menu for additional $16.99.  For the price of the buffet the M casino offers their wine and beer with the price.   If I was asked to come here again I would probably say no, not a huge selection of choices. I will say the server we had was extremely helpful and pleasant to talk to.",

Once we were seated a gentleman took our drink order right away and was very attentive and would offer refills with a few minutes of finishing your drink.   The food: Theres SO many choices here! mexican, fish market, asian (sushi, build your own pho, etc), indian, italian, a salad bar, soul food (fried chicken, mac and cheese) various meats and an array of desserts (key lime, gelato, caramel popcorn, popcorn with chocolate drizzling, etc). The food was pretty good and fresh, although not great. I was mostly impressed at the variety of foods offered.",

I said, \"nope just me\". Then the staff member repeatedly said \"solo? by yourself?\" shheeezuz... that was kind of embarrassing. THEN the staff member who walked me to my table did the same thing! \"just for one? one? by youself?\"..... guess I should look into an escort next time! haha jk  So please tell your staff: don't assume & treat others as you would like to be treated. =)",

It's a nice solid buffet that has something for everyone, including high-value items like sushi and crab legs during lunch and dinner. Of course you're going to be disappointed and find it overpriced if you come here and just eat pizza and salad.   My one complaint is that they're either not staffed correctly or for some other reason they make people stand around waiting for a table while half the tables in the places are sitting empty. That said, the last four times I went we didn't have to wait at all, but it was pretty early on weekdays.",

Crab legs, carved meats, dim sum, an entire dessert corner... this buffet has every delicious food you could possibly desire. I don't understand these mediocre reviews at all; this buffet boasts quality & quantity! I also appreciated the huge seating area & space between tables - I can't stand the hectic, cramped, run-to-get-another-plate ambiance of the typical buffet. Aria's buffet was certainly busy but fortunately didn't feel like it.  One thing... I didn't notice much of a menu change from lunch to dinner. I recommend skipping the inflated evening price by arriving before 3:30p. Service was on the slow side & you kind of need to seriously flag down a waiter for a drink refill. Overall though it was a very yummy experience without the stereotypical buffet atmosphere.",

Food - 0/5  We did the typical routine, walking around getting a little of each to try so we know which one to come back for seconds. On the outside, all foods look very picture perfect, but boy were we wrong.  The food tasted like the chefs had extra salt laying around so they decided to add a few extra table spoons to each dish. I finished 2 glasses of coke before I could finish what was on my plate. After \"the sample\" dish, we bolted for the desert and didn't bother coming back for seconds.   Desert was just ok. Nothing exceptional.  Service - 5/5  Our server was great. Bring our second glass of drink right when we finish our first one. That's attention to detail. Keep up the good work.   In summary, we were disappointed even when the dinner was free. Could you imagine if we paid $80 for 2 people?",

Even though I was here on a Monday, service was a bit slow and one of the meat cutter guys seemed so unhappy to be working. The food itself was alright. I had everything from their hummus and pita chips, to their crab legs, their chorizo breakfast burrito and their cinammon bun. Their hashbrowns were surprisingly great! Crispy and not too oily. Their fruit salad (banana and strawberry) was kinda bland. They had a few kinds of meats, cheeses, an omelette station, some crazy giant three layer pancake and a good handful of flavors of ice cream to end your meal. They also had dumplings, oysters, crayfish and pizza. Good range of foods, alright tasting but service lacked. Would be nice to see a smile or two in there and for sure my drink guy around so that my glass wouldn't be sitting there empty for a long time.

Everything here is good and I love that there are so many options, so it doesn't matter if you're a carnivore/vegetarian/vegan/gluten free. It's very clean and the staff works hard to make sure everyone is happy. I love the $12.99 bottomless drinks! The mimosas, rum punch, and sangria are to die for.

Kids loved turkey with stuffing, however typical of any Vegas buffet restaurant their Sushi was subpar at best, what ever the reason restaurant continue to use cheap non sushi rice and without any additional sushi  seasoning, no flavor.  They should pay few extra dollars to purchase prime sushi rice grain, rice makes the sushi not Neta aka topping.  Other than that I liked the layout of buffet item cluster by meal type.

However, they were very prompt in having us pay and seating us. Price was on the steep side it was $65 altogether for lunch and bottomless drinks. Gratuity of 20% is included for large groups.   We had a group of nine and we all did the bottomless mimosas, wine & beer in addition to the buffet. Wait staff will only bring you refills for one type of drink at a time. You can double fist the same type of drink but they will make you finish your glass to switch over to another type of drink.  The mimosas were extremely fizzy and carbonated thus hard to drink fast and really filling. Don't have too many mimosas if you're trying to get your $35 out of eating at the buffet! My friends did not enjoy the Bloody Mary. Most of us stuck to beer and drank about 4-6 drinks to get a value out of the bottomless. I tried one of the champagne vodka cocktails and that was pretty good too. Overall this is a great spot for large groups to all find what they like to eat and also get some day drinking in.",

For what it's worth, the food did taste REALLY good (get the turkey breast!!) but for the price, I don't think the options were worth it. There was a variety, sure, but in each section it was only a small amount of foods.  The service was pretty poor and they hardly came around to check on us even though the place was nearly empty.",

    "text": "It's a nice, bright place inside the ARIA hotel. We ate there a few times during our stay in Vegas and were mostly satisfied with the food.   The prices aren't low (but what IS cheap in Vegas :D?) - $20 for breakfast, $30 for lunch and $35 for dinner buffet. And if you like to get drunk in the morning, for bottomless alcoholic beverages you must add another $13. The staff is really good in managing guest, as there is always a lot of people there, but lines are up to 10 minutes at most. Breakfast selection is great - a lot of eggs in different forms (the omelet guy is a wizard, I tell you!), pizza, asian rolls, toast, sausages, cereals, skillets, make-your-own-salad station and many many other things. Even crab legs and other seafood, I never knew people eat that for breakfast. Everything was warm and tasty. Dinner there was a bit worse. I imagine it's a mix of breakfast and lunch food. It was good but nothing special. I tried some meats and different kinds of fish and there always was something slightly wrong with it. But the pasta guy is awesome (i think it's the same person that makes omelets!). His dishes are simply wonderful, especially with Alfredo sauce. Mmm. There is also a corner with beautifully made desserts and pastries. I tried a few and they were good, but nothing above average. However, I simply adored the Peanut Butter Gellato. I have eaten it every single day after breakfast or dinner or both :).   All in all, I would recommend this place for breakfast, especially with the family, as I imagine even the most choosy kid will find something to eat there. As for dinner or lunch, I suppose there is a lot of better places to try, even in the ARIA alone.",

International food selection okay although the wide array is not as much as The Vikings in my home country (PH) which is our favorite. Loved their desserts, chowders and pastas. The fruit shakes we got were also quite good and our very friendly and warm server (a Filipina compatriot) was prompt to offer and refill our drinks. She even cheerfully took our photos.  In my country, seafood is plentiful and can be found really fresh, so I detected a hint of lack of freshness in the crab legs which is still understandable. But am amazed at the quantity available. And many I saw actually were very happy with them. People had to queue for the crab legs because of so many wanting to get them over and over again.  Saw a long line outside wanting to come in. Grateful we didn't have to wait in line as our host made a reservation. 44sh degrees celsius outside so thumbs up too for their powerful a/c.  The lone star I did not give is on account of the guy behind the Japanese selection.  But still this sumptuous dinner made our day complete after the Grand Canyon tour we had earlier that day.",

But for $20 for breakfast and $24 for lunch it is a good value. What did I like? They will toss your salad and it is good choices. This won me over. The smoked salmon (lox) was pretty good quality. The fresh fruit was decent. The roasted beets for lunch were delicious. I left happy and not stuffed. Perfect. And I didn't hate it, like I usually do at Mandalay Bay. Well done, Aria.",

I am not sure who designed the lay out in how the food should be organized but it makes no sense. Fellow Yelper Yvonne R. was right about how certain foods are found in random areas. You would think the signs that denote the type of foods there are would help. If you were asked, \"Where did you get that?\" some items will leave you kinda giving abstract directions in an unknown city.   I did notice they have steam crab legs or fresh ones. I am wary to eat the seafood. I had the nigiri and the fish wasn't very fresh. I have to make note I did enjoy the brisket but it's weird because it looks like sauced ribs at the carving table. Do not be confused like me, then again I don't really eat red meat that often. There was not really a wait. I came here on a Friday around lunch time right after arriving into Las Vegas. The place is clean though and the restroom of course is outside the buffet.",

The Buffet at Aria was fun, exciting, enjoyable & honestly quite impressive.  I'm subtracting 1 star because there was a large group of us eating there (about 12 adults, plus I think 3 kids), & they said they'd have to charge an extra $100 bucks to seat us together. My cousin voluntarily paid - through the nose. Never in my life had I heard of an extra $100 charge to seat a big group together. Maybe that's Aria's version of 'Welcome to Vegas'. I'm not sure the place was full, but yeah.  Apart from the annoying $100 charge & the \"the buffet\" logo with its awful kerning (sorry), there really was nothing to complain about. Vegas really does have amazing chefs, & a bunch of them are at Aria. The place has a young, modern feel to it; the food selection was diverse (there was pizza amongst all the sushi & lobster -- or was that crawfish? no idea, hehe); the seafood was fresh & clean but flavorful; the desserts were adventurous & artistic. It was expensive (can't remember how much, exactly), but it's worth the $ if you're a foodie, or eating there for the experience.",

One dinner I had there included ahi tuna steaks that were cooked to perfection.... something that would have been very expensive in a high end restaurant and so amazingly good.  Could not believe something like this was served at a buffet and how good it was.  I love how they put the individual servings in cute little containers.  Also, their dessert station is off the hook - everything I have tried was nothing short of amazing - oh, and they have a gelato station with probably 15-20 different flavors to try.

Server takes sooo long to bring drinks and refills, she also takes long to pick up plates.   The food is not great. The dim sum soggy, the bbq pork bun quickly turns cold and hard.   The Italian station only consist of meatballs in tomato sauce and boiled noodles on the side, very bland. The chicken parmigiana is dry and salty. Looks good but doesn't taste good.  The sushi/seafood bar, typical crab legs, crawfish, clams, and oysters. Clams and oysters not cleaned very well, sandy. The crab legs and crawfish bland no seasonings at all. Even the butter didn't taste like butter. There were only three different kind of rolls not a lot of variety and not very good. Very chewy.  Carving station is usually my favorite!!!! But nope. They had a cart of fresh prime rib, when the guest in front of me asked if he can get the meat that came out fresh and was sitting in the cart, the chef said no. He said they were not going to serve it until about 5:30pm and the time was about 4pm then. The prime rib left on the carving station was well done about two carvings left and we had to take it. I asked if I may have a piece that was medium rare but the chef acted like he couldn't hear me.   Salad bar is the usual and last but not least I had high expectations for their dessert bar. Disgusting. Creme brulee salty. Cookies were hard as rocks. Everything tastes so dry. The only thing good they've got going is probably the gelato which I didn't even bother to try by then.  First and last time. The hype is not real. Food is not worth $41.99 per person. Oh and my party waited until 5:30pm still no beef bone but they finally put out a new slab of meat. Wow... Not so fancy after all.",

The wait to eat on new years eve was not terrible. Maybe 30-45 min. We went around brunch time and the service was better than many people gave them credit for.  The food selection seemed very limited compared to the wynn and bellagio.  But that wasn't even what I was most disappointed with,  the food quality lacked majorly in flavor.  I think the only meat worth eating there was their kilbasa sausage. Pork was over cooked and skin was hard to even cut with their huge bulky dull knife, tri tip was very over done, and their chorizo sausage had no spice.  They had an Italian section which I expected to have all sorts of pastas, instead there was maybe 4 kinds of pizza and spaghetti.    I do not believe I will be coming back.",

I was so disappointed after ponying up $50 a person for their \"holiday special\" buffet, granted this was after Christmas and before NYE so I don't know why they had a surcharge. In any case I think this buffet was geared for international folks from Asia because most of the lines were for the seafood only.  The line was so long, I didn't bother.  The bad- the Mexican food like the Pork verde looked amazing but it tasted like death.  The taquitos and guac too bad and so so sad.  Dessert- the only thing redeeming was the gelato but the small cakes and desserts had about zero flavor.  Salad bar- oh it looked so good, the pre-made salads again were flavorless yet overdressed.  Save your money and go to Wicked Spoon in Cosmo or something better than this mess.",

    "text": "Honestly, coming in here, I did not know what to expect.  I have not really heard much about the buffet at Aria.  Some people have said it was good, and others have condemned the place.  I have to say that Aria gets a B+ in my book.  Considering that the night before, I had eaten at the Bellagio buffet, and was utterly disappointed at the selection, the freshness, and hoards of people trying to load up on food in the already, cramped space.  I was in complete disarray of how horrible Bellagio was this time, compared to the last time I went there.  From a large walkway to accommodate lots of people searching for what they want to pile on their plates, to the modern decor, the Aria buffet was definitely a breath of fresh air.  Of course getting in for free does help quite a bit, thanks to myVegas.    There is a lot of selection to choose from.  Some of the food is already pre-portioned, allowing ease for people to just grab what they desire.  They have types of cuisine which are typical at any buffet.  The dessert selection is also a delight, which features gelato, cakes, pastries, and an assortment of tarts.    I would recommend the Aria buffet considering the fact that maybe Bellagio has peaked, and they do not care about quality of food anymore.",

We decided to try out The Buffet at ARIA despite the mediocre reviews because, for the cost, you can really get your money's worth. At $35 a person (on a weekday) it isn't hard to eat enough crab and carved meat to leave satisfied. The same can't always be said for the $60 buffets. If that had been it, I would probably have left a four-star review.  Unfortunately, in the hour and a half that we were there, we were not waited on once. Thirty minutes in we sought out the hostess who sat us, and she brought us both drinks and assured us that she would send a waiter our way. Six plates and those same two drinks later, we left without ever seeing someone.  It was unfortunate because up until then we have had nothing but amazing service from all of the staff at ARIA.",

The entrees/selections were OK - price was $38.99 per person on a Saturday night, which comes with unlimited wine & a lobster for two, plus endless supply of food from the buffet.  Some notable items on the buffet were the sushi bar, tandoori chicken, freshly baked naan, grilled salmon, and king crab legs. We made our own dipping sauce using butter, pepper, salt, and lemons.  It was delicious and a great experience here.",

So many buffets to choose from, and at a comparable price ($40) to Como's (Wicked Spoon) and Encore's -- this one pales in comparison.   - The line to get in seems to always be really long, except at random hours that aren't usually when people eat - We went after reading all about the crab, but this is where we were most disappointed (and entire Yelp Star off) for the crab (snow, king):  they served it cut in half (length wise) which means you're getting little shards of meat, not those heavenly huge chunks you can get when you crack it yourself. They also serve it cold (read: it's completely frozen) and steamed (limp, soggy, gross) - Huge selection, so if your goal is to stuff your face you're all set and you'll be in heaven -- but if your goal is to taste really well-done versions of international foods-- then this is not your place  - Sushi/sashimi are terrible",

That meant the quality didn't give me the wow factor to continue to fill this belly.  Advice. Pay the extra 20 to eat at Bachannal buffet at Ceasars Palace.",

What I like most about The Buffet - on than the great food - is it's been very consistent. I've noticed many of the buffets in Vegas are good and then decline. For example, I used to love the buffet at Mirage, but it's become a mediocre meal.  Aria's buffet offers a good mix of cuisines. Pretty much anything you eat here is at least decent, if not great. The seafood is fresh, and that's my favorite part of the buffet. The crab legs, clams, etc. are delicious, always. Make sure you save room for dessert because The Buffet has one of the best dessert bars in town.",

There's nothing really good (except the flan) and there's nothing really bad. It has all the standard stations that you'd expect from a Vegas buffet, just without the premier foods.   I got my money's worth from eating endless snow crab that was already cut in half so it was time efficient! They have normal crab claws, but it takes too much time to open it. If you're one of those people who say \" but there's more meat in the claws\" think again. Although you might be right, you can eat the crab meat a lot faster from the ones that are already cut open than taking time to open the crab claws. Thus resulting in more meat!   The service here seemed to have died.. I remember having great service last year with constant refills and check ups. Now you have to chase down someone just for more napkins..   Despite the fall in service and quality of food, I would probably come back again just for the crab and the flan.   P.s. I've had Caesars, Bellagio's and this buffet all in one stay, and the flan is the best here! It's a must have compares to others.",

I came here during the Memorial Day weekend and there was a premium price ($38.99) for lunch. After tax and tip, we were $100 in ($50.00 per person). It's slightly cheaper on non busy time (non holiday) so I guess you get more value then.  The food was just okay. The Flan tasted like it was bad (I never spit out food but this was my first time). The egg Benedict was cold and didn't taste very pleasing. The selection is small, and you don't really see this before you get in. We were very hungry and jumped at the first thing that didn't have a very long line--now I can see why. There is better out there (eg. we will be going to Caesar's for better buffet tomorrow and their price is comparable to this but with much better food.  We only liked the sausage and Mexican rice. Their sweets section is largely good. But the other food was just bad. I'm giving this three stars because it could have been worse. I know buffets aren't supposed to have the best quality (usually quantity over quality), but it was just average. I wouldn't come here again because I didn't feel like I got anywhere near even 20% value of what I paid.",

The desserts are okay if you like them American-style.  What stood out the most were the dumplings. There was plenty of stuffing inside! You don't get that often, since they usually try to minimize the stuffing to keep costs down.  The sticky rice was also good.  Bottom line is, if you're okay with just snow crab legs but want the best meat, go to Le Village Buffet in Paris. If you want to have a variety of crab legs, curry, and Asian food, it is better to go here.  Keep in mind that lines can form, and it can take a while until the servers take your drink orders.",

Asian dishes were really salty and in the Latin section it had onion and cilantro and the onions were chopped in huge chunks like the chef just didn't give a shit. Soda was so flat it just tasted like sugar water and the waitress was nice but the service was so slow because the server was overworked. You would expect much more from a such nice hotel but they serve you with subpar prison cafeteria food that costs $45 a person. A couple of positive things about this buffet was the location and short line.",

    "text": "The Buffet at the ARIA is not too shabby. I admit, compared to the numerous buffets in Las Vegas, the Buffet doesn't stand out, however, there are a definitely things that one will love about this buffet.  Now this review was during Saturday Brunch on Valentine's Day/President's Day weekend. The regular brunch price is $29.99 per person but they decided to increase the price to $35.99 due to the holiday weekend. This was sneaky on their part to raise prices just for the weekend, but I realized $5 wasn't a big deal in Vegas (especially when you have a $50 room credit). It's also convenient for those staying at the ARIA. The line was nonexistent at 9:30a but grew after we left. Still, the line was not ridiculously long.  The Buffet is modern as you would expect walking into the ARIA. There are windows all around so it's quite bright. The decor & furniture also help make the entire restaurant bright. The waiter service was just okay. My orange juice order was forgotten but plates were removed at a reasonable amount of time. I do love that they give you a large pitcher of coffee instead of having to flag the waiter down for a refill.  Overall, they have a good selection of foods. You can find Chinese, Indian, Korean, American, Mexican, Italian, French, and even Filipino food here. Their Asian foods were probably my favorite as they had Filipino longanisa (sausage) and their kimchi fried rice was delicious! They also have a legit tandoori oven to bake the naan. I really appreciate the gluten free options but I did find those dishes to be a bit bland. Most will appreciate that their snow crab legs are already cut in half. Although this saves the mess and time, I definitely feel more satisfied cracking open a crab leg myself. I also think that this dries out the crab meat. Speaking of dry, I found that a lot of their dishes were a bit dry possibly due to overcooking. Their desserts are quite good. I especially loved their revolving gelato machine. Other desserts one should try are their pecan pie and flan.  The Buffet at the ARIA met my expectation and was decent enough with the room credit. I do wish that some of their dishes were more flavorful and less dry. I don't see myself going out of my way to eat at this particular buffet though.",

The selections are vast, foods from different cultures, but really they don't have much flavor. Overall their customer service while purchasing and ordering needs major improvements as well. What made my experience here even more horrible was that I tripped on something that was left on their ground. It was a food item. I fell, twisting my ankle and hurting my lower back. Some nice people sitting and having dinner tried helping me. A waiter gave me a chair and called the manager. The manager came and quickly but all she cared about was the area and called for the incident reporters to come and take pictures and she just asked me for my ID. I asked for an ice pack, and she said no. She just stood there and waited for the pictures to be taken. I was asked to write a report about what happened and they kept taking pictures. During this time, not one individual cared about what I was feeling and the pain I was in. Finally, I got upset and asked for ice again and it was given. We waited over an hour for the paramedics to come and access my situation. Luckly, nothing was broken. I had minor muscle strains. But, the way this was handled was extremely unprofessional and lacking major customer service. The manager did not even come by to see how I was doing. They gave me a refund on the meal, which I didn't even eat. All in all, I had a better opinion about Aria and this definitely changed my perspective of them. The was not the first but will definitely be the last time I go there...",

The food selection is much more expansive, the pricing - fairly reasonable, and the layout, no longer a cluster#4k (although some sections still have retarded elevation changes). I recently tried the weekend brunch buffet for about $30 per person. They've decoupled the price of food and alcohol to make the buffet seem more economically priced compared to other high end buffets like Bacchanal over at Caesars. I'd still say that Caesar's buffet is still the better of the two, but Aria's at least will not leave you disappointed. There's some standout food items like the dim sum tray and the indian food selection. One sore spot for the buffet would be the lack of fruit choices for brunch- watermelon, cantaloupe, and honeydew shouldn't be the only fruit choices at a high end buffet.   If you have an Mlife players club card (Pearl and above) you can utilize the buffet line pass. Overall, a nice option, if you are trapped within City Center.",

So, oh so many options...from the split crab legs to the mini pizzas...freshly carved brisket to the freshly made pasta selections...let's just say the best thing about the buffet is that no matter how much food you think you have on a plate, there will be someone that will have more.  I mostly gravitated towards to the seafood but some of my other faves were on the dessert section...the mini triple chocolate cake pops and mocha flavored cupcakes were stand outs for me. They also had several varieties of pies and several flavors of ice cream/gelato available.  Drink service was decent too. Left the waitress a fiver since she was nice and pleasant.",

Service needs improvement - drinks and check-in intervals took a very long time. I'll give this place 3-3.5/5 stars.   The highlight of the buffet was the scallop and angus beef dish (the sides, which includes the wasabi flavoured mashed potato was yummy too!). Several chefs were designated at separate stations of the buffet, you can request for them to cook you their specialty.   With the hotel facilities and rooms being so new and nice, I was expecting better food variety at the buffet.  Since I stayed here while I was in Vegas, it would've been nice if the buffet had better variety so we can escape the blazing heat outside haha.",

The meat carving station was pretty good but the placement is awful - people that were just trying to get some pancakes and other breakfast items were constantly crossing paths with us. The dim sum/Asian area was not good. Cute concept (that every other buffet is doing these days) but the food was dry and overcooked.

Our own experience started out horribly and didn't improve much. We noticed two lines. Regular and an MLife member/sky suite line. It was about 5:30 pm and restaurant was half full. We were staying at the Aria and have M-Life membership, though the lowest level. We got into the MLife line and waited there probably about 20 minutes. Neither lines were really moving much, though the other line had gotten longer. Then an employees comes out and asks for our card and then rudely points us and several other guests to the other line. We should of made a fuss as we had waited so long, but as it was early dinner for us we just moved lines and waited approximately 20 more minutes.  We bought the unlimited cocktails but as we feel waiter staff should earn their tips, and not just be automatically given an arbitrary percentage, we chose to tip in cash versus charging our room. Not sure if this was a mistake or not but our waiter was definitely slow in bringing refills. We did though leave a nice tip as he did take plates away rather quickly. Many of the chefs along the various stations were pretty rude as well. With the exception of the make your own pasta station, he was quite pleasant and it was by far the best food at the buffet.  The food. Well, it was pretty awful. We maybe didnt do enough research ourselves. But we were let down. We saw many pictures of bone marrow and pork belly and lamb etc. no such dishes were served. The prime rib was not good, usually a buffet staple. The latin foods were quite bland. Asian felt like frozen dumplings that they just reheated. There were some dishes that just didnt seem to be replenished frequently. Especially the thai tea. There was really nothing spectacular there.  And many of the labels were either missing or simply wrong. This was simply unacceptable for such a high priced buffet. Please if you are on the fence, stay away from this place. It is definitely not worth the time nor money.",

This is what I look forward to the most and is what is shown in all of Aria's advertisements for the buffet. Next, the Asian food was dry or had a funky taste to it. The only food I enjoyed was fried chicken and mashed potatoes. Things also seem to have gone downhill on presentation. During my previous visits, everything was put together like a miniature work of art. Not so impressed this time.  For a $28.99 brunch we expect a lot more.

They had ham, turkey, sausage and 2 cheap cuts of beef.  The beef that I got was a little dried out.  The sushi section was just 2 trays of laughable and dried out sushi rolls.  I guess to make up for it, they have a fresh poke station.  The Indian section was actually decent but the curries was a tad too spicy.  The Mexican and Italian stations had food that was all dried up and just looked like it should have been thrown away.  The desserts were more fresh and the gelato wheel is cool to look at but the flavors weren't all that appealing to me.  I did chose the watermelon lime vegan sorbet and it was very refreshing.   Oh and the crab legs were so skinny with little bits of meat, the clams and mussels were rubbery... just wasn't the best food.

Few breakfast options available but but lunch entres, which should have just been set out, look like it been sitting since yesterday. We got our money back and left without eating",

    "text": "Great buffet that made up for the smaller size with quality of offerings.  Everything we tried was awesome.  It seems like since they offer less they were able to pay more careful attention to seasoning and doneness of their offerings.  The details matter sometimes, and they get it right here.   They offer an Indian cuisine section which was a nice change, and I am always a sucker for a pasta bar where you create your own pasta dish.  Their carved meats were seasoned perfectly.   Service was great as they brought out carafes of our chosen beverages so we never had to worry about asking for a refill.  The desserts were great also.  Creme brulee was awesome, and they even gave us a couple fresh ones with the crispy top!",

This is by far the best buffet I have ever set eyes on. But wait, it gets better... The variety is one thing but the freshness really seals the deal for me. Highly recommended for breakfast or brunch.",

I wouldn't say that it's a great place to dine, as there are so many other great buffet's at the same price point on the Las Vegas strip. But as I said it's convenient for hotel guests.  I waited at the carving line for sometime before someone came to assist me and many items were gone and it seemed to take a while for someone to bring out more. I can say that the waiting staff is very friendly and attentive. To reiterate, I'm not saying not to eat here but don't make a trip to aria just for the buffet.",

This brunch buffet was a special one for Chinese New Year. It cost $5 more, but it was worth it! -Line was long but they move as fast as there are tables.  -No problems- nice buffet, but nothing so so great that is blew my socks off.  - The decor is nice. Modern and comfy to sit in. Wynn beats them on decor because of the flowers etc, but still very good to sit down and enjoy your food. - Service was fine! Waitress was polite and no judgement on how much you ate. She even told us to get dessert before we left! - They had Shu Mai and Pork Buns which made me really happy for the New Year Brunch, so I dont know if these are on the menu all the time for brunch. Stir fry flat white noodles which is hard to get on a buffet made me really happy! They had peeled and de-veined cold shrimp + Purple Rice Sushi!!!! These foods right here gave it 4 stars!  - Their Mac and & Cheese tickled my fancy. Some of the best I had. Pizza didnt taste that great, and the fried chicken was getting cold because it was sitting out for awhile. Didnt bother me or anything, but these 2 were my least favorite.",

    "text": "We arrived early one morning to stay at our hotel at Vdara and Aria is just literally next door.  From our hotel, you can either walk outside and use the sidewalk or to avoid the hot temperatures you can use the Tram (air conditioned every step of the way).  We were hungry and decided to stop by for brunch.  Personally, brunch gives you more bang for your buck.  The price can seem steep but they have a huge display of food from just about every country for lunch and made to order omelets and breakfast items in case you wanted both lunch and dinner.  We paid $28.99 per person.  Breakfast is $20.99 and Dinner is $38.99 during the week.  Prices increase during the weekend and during the holidays.  They also offer an unlimited drink option for $19.99 for 2 people.  This covers a selection of mixed drinks and sodas.  As far as service goes, the lines are a little long and if you plan to eat during the normal times then you can expect a wait so try to arrive early.  We waited in line for about 20-25 minutes.  Their service was great.  For each section you're assigned a server and ours was very attentive.  I tried just about every item from each country and all tasted pretty good.  I was a little disappointed about the crab legs (I'm extremely picky about my seafood) but they were bland and dry.  Great place for all you can eat with a wide selection of items.  I rated this place 4 stars only because of the over cooked seafood.  Service was pleasant, great establishment in a hip hotel.",

The wait was 1.5 hours which would have been fine if they actually used all of the tables. We saw at least 12 tables open that weren't even being used. Managers just walked around not helping clean tables. Once we finally got to the front of the line to pay, Teresita had an attitude when ringing us up. She didn't listen to us when we told her we were using our myVEGAS rewards and then got rude when she messed up. She was also talking to a coworker and ignoring us the whole time. The bartender had an attitude problem and asked us for our receipt when we were only on our second drink, then tells us our waiter should be getting our drinks... they never asked us once if we wanted anything from the bar. Seems like they didn't even want us here. Waste of time and money. Would never recommend this place.",

    "text": "There were a few good items, but was mostly forgettable. I'd rank Aria's offering in the Vegas buffet lineup somewhere in the middle.  Let's start with some good points.  As silly as it might sound, the horchata was my favorite thing! It's rich and creamy a perfect touch of cinnamon. No es authentico pero es muy sabroso!  The pan roast was delicous, with fat pieces of seafood. The prime rib was seasoned and cooked to perfection. All. You. Can. Eat. Prime. Rib.   Finally, their caramel cream puffs were a great way to cap off the glorious assault on my bowels.  Now, onto the not-so-good points...  Imagine if #saltbae had severe Alzheimer's and kept forgetting whether or not he seasoned his food. That's how I imagine the person who made the paella. It was so salty that when I put it in my mouth, it made me wince and spit it out.  Besides the prime rib, most of the other meats were very dry. The slice of beef on the steak salad was particularly dry; borrowing a Gordon Ramsay retort, it was like eating Gandhi's flip flop!  The \"ethnic\" foods were poorly done, with little regard to authenticity. Also, Stevie Wonder seems to be in charge of labeling the food. Many things were labeled totally wrong. For example, I saw carne asada and tortillas labeled as Indian curry. Wrong labeling might not be a big deal to most people, but some rely on them due to dietary restrictions.  Service was good and very attentive. Unfortunately, considering that there are numerous better buffets along the strip, I can't recommend Aria's.",

It was absolutely terrible! We went on Friday evening 6/28/2019. Because we were so excited, upon our arrival I happily greeted the person at the cashiers counter with a very happy hello. She didn't smile, she didn't reply, and she didn't say hello or a how are you? Instead.....and almost instantly she just gave of the price for out meal. I even said to her, \"not even a hello?\" Still nothing. We paid and got seated. We sat at our table for nearly 25 minutes without a single word or drink orders being taken. I even asked the person who sat us, and probably sat a dozen more tables around us if she could get our server. She replied by saying she is on her way. I asked another server for service, she told us she wasn't our server....and we continued to wait. Tired of waiting and hungry, we went to get our food. We returned and still no drinks and no server. It wasn't until towards the end of our first round that finally someone showed up. By this time the experience was completely destroyed. For some reason the food experience was also not the best, as the pictures we saw online about the buffet did not match what they were serving. The sushi offered was terrible, or nearly nonexistent. I do not recommend anyone spend this kind of money for a buffet, not to mention the cost of parking, etc. please do not waste your time.",

Building a spectacular eating establishment with unique architecture and good food is much easier than providing great customer service.  My ARIA brunch buffet started rough. The cashier and hostess were not friendly. They seemed put off that I would even ask questions.  The buffet has almost endless choices of Asian, Italian, American, Mexican and even German cuisine. (Sausages)  I tried some new selections. Taro Buns. Not a fan but I'm sure some diners love them. The sauce was good.  Try their smoothies and fresh fruit. Healthy and delicious.  In the end, I had a decent brunch. But, the customer service was well below average for what everyone deserves and pays for in a five-star resort hotel.  I probably won't come back because there are so many excellent choices in Las Vegas.  Recommendation: go somewhere else.",

    "text": "I have eaten at many buffets in Vegas, and hardly ever feel that I get my money's worth when dining at them. I prefer quality of food over quantity, and you usually don't get that at a buffet.  Let's start with the positives of my experience at Aria's Buffet. The service was friendly and finished plates were immediately cleaned off the table to make room for more. The stations of food were constantly refilled and kept clean as well. I came here for the Sunday brunch, and I really like that they limit the total number of people dining at a time. There is always a long line at any omelet station, however that was not the case here. Although the dining area looked full, there were never more than a few people at each section to get food.  Sadly, my group had so much consistent food waste that you could probably feed a homeless camp. Most of the food looked quite appetizing but it was barely edible/enjoyable.   I was really excited to see that pho was an option. You fill your bowl with glass noodles, meat and the steaming hot soup base. However, because the meat and noodles were apparently frozen cold to begin with, the soup instantly turned cold. Nothing is worse than cold pho.  The fried chicken, well all of the chicken dishes that I tried were very dry and had no seasoning on it. The crab legs were oddly overly salted and did not taste fresh at all. The pizza and omelet were probably my favorite dishes from the buffet, but why would I need to go to a buffet for items such as those?  I love staying at ARIA when I'm in Vegas, but I won't be back to this buffet any time soon.",

    "text": "We stayed at a nearby hotel and was looking for buffet options around the general vicinity. Never been to the Aria's buffet, so decided to give this place a try. On this trip, my in-law wanted to come, and we had no real option of leaving the kids at home, so we took them. Aria's buffet is $43 as of this date, and the plus was that kids under 12 eat free. Super huge bonus because my girls don't eat much.  I was surprised at the mediocre ratings of this buffet. I know Bacchanal is top dog, but I think people have to get that out of their heads that there are other great options as well. Unlike some buffets that are on the casino level, this one is on the mezzanine, which is probably the reason the seating area is massive. We came on a Sunday night at around 7:30pm and was immediately seated.  Looking around, I could already see the myriad of foods ready to be eaten. The things that stood out for me? Prime rib, lamb chops, mango sausage, poke bowl, and pho. And of course, the crab feast.  The prime rib and lamb were cooked nicely, if anything, they could have been a touch rarer and it would have been perfect. Poke bowl was fresh and they had this salmon dish that was awesome. And for those so inclined...bone marrow. Not me.  The highlight was dessert! A rotating selection of really good gelato. I recommend the mango coconut - holy crap, it was one of the best tasting ice creams I've ever had. Another must try was their ube cookie. My wife thought about wrapping up a few \"to go\" but the fat gods might punish us later said the husband.  Service was great - plates cleared quickly and drinks refilled. Even coffee was offered, which is a rarity for buffets.  With their pricing and selection, I think this place is a great Vegas buffet value.",

Salty steamed crab legs that were steamed in small portions, so if 3 adults fill up their plates, you gotta wait till the next patch is steamed up...,so they can add more SALT in the steaming process is my guess.  Crab claws had no salt in them, which is better for me  Very salty and fatty beef and pork meats... it would of been nice if the meat stations were labeled.   Mini pho bowls where the broth was saltier than needed  Spicy Indian food, even for me.  Overall, this was one of the \"saltiest\" buffet I've eaten at.   Waitress was 5 STARS and Awesome!  Wait time in the line to get in was an hour. Seem like an eternity with everyone watching the hotel guests go in first. Was this buffet worth the 1 hr wait time? NO. Only worth it if you have BOGO.   Waitstaff working the crab seafood stations were just rude and tolerable. Every question was answered \"rudely\" with a condescending \"tone\". Not one time, but every time with a \"sneer laughter\".  Unacceptable. Don't like your job?? Look elsewhere if you don't like dealing with the public in a professional manner.  Overall experience is it's barely a 3 STARS buffet despite everything",

Let me use Marie Kondo's 'KonMari' method to describe the food here. Grab a dish, eat it, and if it sparks joy, then eat it again. If it doesn't spark job, thank it and move on. Literally nothing sparked joy, I didn't reach for seconds with any dish. The only two things that made me want to reach for seconds were the Truffled Potatoes Gratin, the Kielbasa, and the Chicken Jalapeno Mango Sausage.  After I downed my disappointing meal, I joked around with my friend that I could see Herringbone across the way. Just there, mocking me, because I know 100% that I could've had such a better meal for the same price.  Aria, get it together with your buffet. You are a prized hotel on the Strip, but this buffet just made your reputation look sad. Bring in some creativity and amp up your food presentations, then it might spark joy for all future diners.",

I prefer the crab over at Wynn, though, because it is split and easier to eat. At Aria, that isn't the case. Also, the shrimp at Aria has full shell and has to be peeled more. Desert selection at the buffet was pretty good as was the spread of East Asian food.",

When we got the bottomless drink option, the waiter was very good about asking if we wanted refills whenever the glass got low.  We came here three times for lunch during our weekend stay, and each time was great. Compared to other places we've eaten (Wynn Buffet, Spice, and Bacchanal), the crab legs were the best by far. They're always very fresh, constantly replenished and not once did they event run low! There are also plenty of mussels, clams, etc. The only thing I didn't like about the selection was the lack of good sushi (there were only 3 or 4 different kinds, and none looked very appetizing) and fruit variety (melons + pineapple).

    "text": "The thing to do in Vegas (besides gambling/drinking/clubbing) is eating buffets! My friends have been telling me that this place is one of the better buffets in Vegas so I knew I had to give this place a try.  I came here for Brunch on a Saturday..when I got here there was a line, but it moved pretty fast and we didn't wait too long even though there was a group of 12 of us. The price was about $32 and plus gratuity was about $41 bucks for each of us. Some of my friends chose to get bottomless champagne /mamosas....their total came out to be about $50.   The buffet like everything else about Aria is very pretty. I noticed the dessert area first and it was sooo pretty. Probably the prettiest dessert bar that I have seen in any Vegas buffet. The selection of the food was good...not too big not too small. Its all about quality over quantity here. Everything that I got was good for the most part...this is probably one of the better buffets that I have been to in Vegas. My favorite part here is the dessert of course. So good and yummy.",

Very modern and extremely clean. - The service, although slow at first, was great once it picked up. Clean plates were taken and drinks were always refilled (sometimes with a little extra umph in there :) - Very spacious, no trouble walking around in between stations.  The Bad: - The selection of great food is minimal compared to other buffets - Only very few items actually  stick out, and out of those, only 1 or 2 are actually good  There's really not much else to say about this buffet. I honestly wasn't overly impressed compared to other buffets.",

The only things I did like about this buffet were the choice of deli meats, and the quality of their flan. But those two alone would not get me to step foot in this buffet again.",

One of us couldn't eat Gluten, so the blackboard menus at each station showing the gluten free items was a nice touch. However, she said there weren't any special gluten-free dishes, all were what you could eat almost anywhere - except the pizza.   For my other friend and myself the sushi and fish dishes were good, but not outstanding. I thought the Chicken Parmesan to be very good, we both loved the baby beets and lamb with mint jelly.  Desserts were ok, the pistachio ice cream was a hit with all three of us. With tax and tip the cost for all 3 was just shy of $150. We decided that was a bit steep - perhaps brunch or a weekday dinner if we were in the neighborhood. For this cost I'd rather be at the Wynn.  Bottom line: just acceptable",

We have been to many buffets in Vegas and I would say this is one of the worst. The so called \"King crab\" is not that at all. Service is mediocre, very unorganized! I make better food blindfolded! I don't recommend this at all, all around is was terrible food!",

The bottomless drinks were also pretty fantastic - I've had sangria and a mimosa, my husband had a bloody mary and a beer - and both food and drinks were relatively inexpensive. Last but not least: the dessert selection was fabulous. I still relive the caramel flan...  The biggest problem with this buffet was that it took some time to get in: long line at the door even though it appeared half empty inside.  Other than that, highly recommend: it's worth your time and money.",

The Buffet at the Aria delivers on this element with random abandon, but the total tragedy of taste and inconsistency that is delivered with some items prepared almost perfectly and some contemptuously under-prepared is truly heart breaking for any buffet loving foodie.  The buffet area and dining areas are kept impeccably clean, the staff were friendly, and swept in when necessary without becoming a nuisance. The dining area hosts numerous seating arrangements with different views and a fantastic modern design. It's very unfortunate that the price to value is underwhelming against them with respect to the amount of preparation variance in the buffet items.",

I was lined up to redeem my myvegas reward for myself, however I had another person at my party who was in a different line. As soon as I walked up she barked \"How many people in your party\" in a bored yet aggravated tone, as if I was inconveniencing her. Wanting to sit with my friend but not wanting to be charged for two buffets, I started to explain: \"Well, I am redeeming a reward from Myvegas but...\"  That's when she cut me off by saying \"NO, I asked you HOW MANY PEOPLE IN YOUR PARTY?\".  I was speechless for a second then decided to reply lest I incur more of her wrath. \"OK, I have two\". She quickly rang me up for two buffets although I could see my friend across the other line already paying for hers. Then she asked \"How are you paying?\" like some angry robot. I replied that i am using a Myvegas reward - this is True. She then asked me \"NO, how are you paying for the difference\"? \"Well, I am NOT paying for the difference. There are two people in my party but I am paying for myself only. I was trying to tell you.\" She just looked at me like I had bananas coming out of my ears, then said \" You know you can redeem both rewards here\" and proceeded to ring up the meal silently (but still with attitude) handing me the folio with my receipt.  That's nice lady but that's not what's happening. If you didn't cut me off mid-sentence,  you'd know what's going on.   So, this unfortunately ruined the lunch for me. It's very disappointing considering the reputation of Aria as a 4-star resort. This was my 3rd time coming here and I had always had good experiences and good meals. My server was great and attentive and everything she should be. But due to this poor service with this cashier, I don't think I would be back.",

Not as tasty as you would expect from an expensive buffet on the strip. Also the service is lacking. We came in for Friday night dinner. Everyone we encountered was super nice, however  the problem was getting someone to attend to us. We were on our second plate of food before someone came to our table to ask what we'd like to drink. After that, we had a pile of dirty dishes on the side of our table. And didn't get a refill on my drink until halfway done with dessert. I completely understand if the situation was because of being under staffed, but with the food and service leaving something to be desired, I don't see us returning here.",

I don't know what happen to the restaurant that day, but the food experience is a total disappointment. Although there are big variety of food to choose, but the food quality is very low. Frist, everything tastes so salty, except for the sweets or deserts. If you have high blood pressure, heart problem or kidney problem, please don't eat there. There a tons of sodium just in one piece of meat or vegetable. In additional, there are sands on the seafood occasially. My partner and I both experienced dizziness or headaches after eating the buffet. I almost feel like I am getting a stroke or infection from the raw seafood. The dinner costs $38 per person and it is a lot worse than an average Buffett in my city in California only cost $15. Speehless, sad, and disappointed. Great waiter, employees and customer service tho, that's why 2 stars instead of 0.",

Sighs~  Food quality is average. Choices are okay. Didn't really WOW me with the price they charge.  Food display is kind of spread out so no long wait line to get the food. However, putting the food inside the heavy pot... not too convenience. First, the lid is way too heavy & hot. Also, you have to put down your plate first then open the lid to get the food?? With the lid on, you can't really see what's inside. Not an ideal way to display the food.   Service is bad. Each server is taking care too many tables. Hard to get the server to refill the drink.   Not too impressed with the dinning experience.",

Everything from the staff to the food was amazing from beginning to end. The staff was friendly and was always providing top notch service. We never had a dirty dish on our table and always had our beverages filled to the top. I also appreciated  how Chef Kreg asked how we were enjoying our meal. The little things like that help enhance your experience and make you feel valued.  The food was absolutely phenomenal! I almost wish I didn't get full so fast so I could try more. My favorite part was the endless amount of fresh seafood. They never ran low on anything and every item I picked seemed like it was in the ocean the day before. I also would like to rave about the lamb chops. I am picky with lamb, so it says a lot if they got my approval with that one. It was cooked to perfection along with their other meat choices. I had the prime rib as well and wish I had saved room for the cowboy steak. I didn't have it, but my friend said it was her favorite.  My favorite dessert was the pistachio gelato. I have this odd obsession with pistachios so I when I saw it in the gelato form, I had to indulge. It was the perfect way to end my perfect dinner.  The best way I could describe this experience is it truly is fine dining cuisine in a buffet setting. Kudos to Chef Kreg, our server Kelly, and the rest of the staff. Keep up the good work, guys! I'll be back soon!",

Great asian selections, some new things like the mediterranean side, then the good home cooked meals like fried chicken and shrimp & grits.  The carving station is also good, but they only gave one slice at a time you have to keep going back.

They had a wide variety of items.   Here at Aria, I didn't see that. Their selection seemed limited and whatever was there, was rather basic and lacked in flavor. They literally had like two to three kinds of sushi, how disappointing. A lot of their food didn't have the flavor that hooked me.  The service was also not up to par. Our waitress/server lagged in cleaning up our used plates, etc. It was a really busy night so I understood how she must've had many tables, but I took note that she kept going to two specific tables more often than ours. We literally had to call her over because we had so many dirty dishes piled up. It was really disappointing. I'm not sure I'd recommend this buffet to anyone and I'm sad to say so.  UPDATE: Not sure what my sister ate there but she's been throwing up all night since we had dinner.",

Since we were hungry and a little hungover from the night before, anything that looks appetizing was good.  I basically stuck around the section with all the crab legs. Now you know what I eat the most. Lol. They were fresh as it was packed around ice. The beauty of these crab legs wasn't about its size, but how they're already cut in half for you to easily consume. Delicious!   Other items I've tried was the roasted beef (not prime rib), roasted chicken, smoked salmon,  spicy tuna sushi roll, broccoli, pepperoni pizza, their dim sum sieu mais (dumping), the tossed green Cesar Salad, and finally their fresh fruits.  I don't know why they call their beef \"roasted beef\" rather than using the fancy prime rib. Maybe it was a different area of the cow? But that huge roasted slab of meat did look wonderful.  But I think they should have let the meat absorb the marinated flavor a bit longer since it wasn't too flavorful in the mid cut.   Believe it or not, aside from the crab legs, I probably enjoyed the salad and the fresh fruits the most. It look so fresh that I had to indulge. Yep, I need my greens and vitamin C.   It kind of sounds like I'm an oinker for eating so much which I actually am, but really I only took a small proportion of everything to try out. Yes, I was stuffed from the variety.  The buffet is well kept and very clean. I wouldn't worry too much about getting food poisoning since they deal with huge volumes. So the probability of something getting spoiled is rare.  Again, the food is mediocre. But come and enjoy anyways. For us, nothing beats a free comp meal.  Haha.",

    "text": "I was staying at Aria with some friends and we had some resort credit to use, so of course, we opted for staying in our hotel for BUFFET :D Only 20ish dollars for the weekend brunch, not bad, not bad at all. We also came a little bit before dinner, so we could pay the brunch price and get both brunch AND dinner foods. Gotta love beating the system :)  Immediately, the buffet pleased me. Why, you ask? There was no line! I'm so used to waiting in huge lines whenever I eat at the buffets in Vegas (especially Paris&Bellagio, those buffets ALWAYS have at least a 45 minute wait). We were seated pretty quickly, even though we were a large group, and we were immediately chowing down. For the weekend brunch, they had a good amount of food items. Snow crab legs, sushi, eggs benedict, caprese salad, sliced bacon, pancakes, breakfast burritos... I could go on forever. Most of the food was decent, but nothing really blew me out of the water. Once the menu changed to dinner, there were king crab legs, lobster ravioli, freshly baked naan, prime rib, refried beans, etc etc. Some of the food was delicious and some was just meh. The refried beans were INCREDIBLY salty to the point where I couldn't eat anymore after the first bite. I was also pretty disappointed with the king crab legs. I LOVE crab and I've had king crab legs at a buffet before (the wynn) but these didn't taste as good; they tasted exactly the same as the snow crab legs, which was really disappointing.  This buffet really shined in the dessert area. All of the desserts looked beautiful and I was really happy with their spread; plenty of cakes, cookies, and even a serving station for gelato. I tried the nutella cake (DELICIOUS), pot de creme (freaking amazing!!!), and of course, the creme brulee. Everything I tried from the dessert bar was orgasmic-tasting. I thoroughly enjoyed it.  As for the service, ours was pretty decent. There were portions of time where they wouldn't come and plates would be stacking, but we always had liquid to drink and I was pretty content.  Overall, it's a decent buffet. Food is average & the desserts are GREAT. The price is definitely better than some of the other buffets in Vegas, but I think if you want some quality food, I'd go for the Wynn or Bellagio buffets. Otherwise, I feel like this buffet is still undiscovered, so you are bound to not have to wait too long to get your buffet on :) 3.5 stars!",

Only has a few types of sushi, salmon & shrimp sushi, some rolls, no sashimi, the rice was soooo hard. Dessert didn't have much choices too, worst creme brulee I've never had. Overall, the buffet doesn't worth $36 and will never go back again. So disappointed on such a high end hotel would have such a bad buffet.",

    "text": "all i have to say about the buffet here is BLECH...it's not SO bad that it gets only 1 star, but it's far inferior to buffets i've tried elsewhere in vegas (i.e. bellagio)...especially for the price...for roughly $35/person, it's money better spent elsewhere...and actually, now that i think about it, yuck, i would not eat here again  like most vegas buffets, they had an assortment of cuisines, but nothing really stood out...they had king crab legs, prime rib, steak, turkey and sushi stations...sure it SOUNDS good, but don't let your eyes and ears trick you...everything tasted a little off, i feel like nothing was fresh! and i would DEFINITELY avoid the sushi and i'm pretty sure the shrimp was the thaw and serve kind...also, each person get's HALF a lobster with their meal...but again, didn't taste that fresh and they don't clean them very well so it wasn't a very appetizing presentation...and when i mean not clean them very well, lobster poo was still all up in there...i know for some folks out there, they just eat that sh*t up, but for me, no thanks because seriously, do you serve kobe beef with a side of poo, no!  so overall review, either their food had been sitting out for awhile, or it was thaw and serve...blech blech blech...i mean, for it to be in the ARIA hotel and have TROPICANA quality buffet, i would totally skip  desserts were AWFUL...the selection was limited and again, nothing tasted quite right...i would go with the creme brulee, i mean seriously, you have to be tastebudless to get that classic dessert wrong  not to sound like a lush, but the only saving grace is the fact they had unlimited wine included in the $35...i'm sure it's boxed wine, but compared to the tasteless slop they were serving, the wine tasted like rainbows  oh, FYI, after dinner (and for the rest of the night) i had the worst heartburn/stomach ache...i'm convinced it was the lobster!",

    "text": "When choosing a buffet in Las Vegas Strip, there is a balance of food quality, variety, cost and ridiculous lines. Both Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal Buffets get a lot of press, but they also are more expensive and also have long lines. I am vegetarian so a variety of exotic meats are not a high priority for me, so that was also a reason I am not partial to those buffets as well. I thought Aria had a variety of choices for the Sunday Brunch when i visited. I enjoyed that they had a number of asian dishes including Chinese and a couple Indian dished that were respectable quality. The omelets were pretty bland, but the deserts were fantastic. Gelato and pies were amazing. The service is very friendly, lines were a bit long. Food quality varies based on what you are looking for, but I would call it above average among popular buffets on the strip.",

    "text": "We decided to check out City Center, now that grand opening is over and the crowds would have thinned out by now. Overall the City Center is kind of futuristic and had a industrial/modern theme to it. I felt like I was in some futuristic movie like \"Logan's run\". ha ha. We had dinner at the Buffet on a Sunday night. No line to get in, so we were seated right away. Below average busy and it felt touristy. Food was good and bad, some stuff was good, some stuff was bad. If you got the right combination of choices, you may be pleased, but you needed to try a little of everything to find out what you like, then by that time your stomach is saying, \"What the hec is going on?\" Crab was good, Sushi was dry and tasteless (for tourists) and don't touch the Raw, dry salmon, get the root word here, SALMON-ella. Salad bar, boring, Meats? undercooked, Indian, OK, Pizza? The same junk like other buffets, how could this be at a nice fancy place? The pasta, chesses, grilled veggies, again boring and some where dry. Chinese food? a few acceptable items, but mostly bland and nothing special. Bread, cheese, this that...nothing great. Desserts looked impressive, but none being noteworthy. Please get rid of that fancy curved plate! It's not functional in a buffet setting and some of the corners were chipped. There are other reviews here beaming about the dessert, but surely we didn't see what was so special about it. Service was barely acceptable. A dessert fork would have been nice since you only get a single fork the entire meal. I used my teaspoon. We noticed some people got up to get some dessert and when they returned to their seat the table was cleared and new customers sitting it their place. So the seating system needs some practice. I had to ask for a drink refill and the bussing of the tables were good and bad. Also when a patron is eating crab legs, maybe offer a extra plate for the shells? I don't know, but we probably won't return....no we are locals and know better, we won't return, unless by some unseen set of events. City Center Buffet at Aria, good for tourists I guess.",

For being such an amazing hotel, they sure are stingy. The waitress forgot to give one of our friends a lobster and when we brought it to her attention she insisted that she had brought out the right amount. She argued and gave us attitude for a good 5 minutes before finally giving in. The selection was MINIMAL and honestly there was just a lot of empty space. Not only was it bad food, it was OVER PRICED! I would definitely skip this place when at Aria",

First stop  ..the centrally located Seafood island. We got a sampling of crab legs, oysters on the half shell, yellowtail sushi etc. The crab was mushy, I also got a few bad oysters (mushy too), the sushi was passable.  Next we hit the rest of the lines offerings.  Skipping most to try a few items I normally like. Tried the obligatory Prime Rib, which was fine, but certainly not as good as a stand alone Prime Rib restaurant. Tandoori chicken was next.  The chicken was ok, but very dry. I then got a few slices of deli salami.  All were overly chewy and had a funny taste. At that point I went on to some melon , all of which were totally unripe and tasted like cardboard.  I finally went to the desert station and got a small sampling of baked goods. They were ok, but I have to say I was disappointed that they had no ice cream to complement the Bananas Foster. In all fairness they told me the machine was broken.  All in all, I would say the meal was mediocre.   The meal was barely passable, however we will not be making a return trip. My wife made the same comments to me. If you want a truly good buffet, try The Bachanal at Caesars Palace. It was NOT worth the price of admission.",

Waitress was attentive to remove empty plates and even kept our water and ice tea full (There is no drink self-service).  I liked the food.  There was a good variety, and it didn't seem to be a bunch of low-rent/cheap items.  The items were fresh, and the carver station meats were moist.

    "text": "I LOVE Aria as a hotel and casino. So this pains to me to give their buffet such a low rating, but I was really disappointed with their post-renovation offerings...  Food: The crab legs were good and the prime rib decent but there was a real lack of selection! The entire Mediterranean section was basically hummus. And there were a lot of things that repeated. The desserts LOOKED good but were for the most part uninspiring. The gelato was delicious (and fun to look at as its display case rotated) but was too soft probably due to the case opening and closing too many times.  Service: Service was excellent and we had the friendliest waitress ever. Kudos to her!  So all in all, I can't recommend the Aria buffet. It's a shame as the hotel is great and one of our favorites. Is it that hard to make a better buffet to match the rest of the hotel, especially when they're charging more than Bellagio? Skip this and take the monorail to Bellagio for a more satisfying experience.  Tip: If you MUST eat here, lunch/dinner swaps out around 3:30pm so come a little before that and pay the lunch price ($22.99 on M-F) but get the dinner selections saving you about $11 per person ($17 on Friday!). Just make sure you don't cut it too close on time as the line can get pretty long, especially on weekends. (If you have a pearl or higher Mlife card, you can go to the VIP line.)",

    "text": "The buffet was our least favorite of restaurants on site. I never find any buffet food up to standard as it's just a place to gorge yourself. This was pretty much the same. We wanted to try it because everyone says the buffets in Vegas are the best. The hot foods were mediocre-good, but the desserts were really tasty. Whomever is making those desserts can do with a raise because I went back for seconds.  The tandoori chicken at the Indian station sat too long and was dry. The curry was good. Everyone goes mental for pre-cracked crab legs, I never really understood that. They feel as if they are getting one-up on the man if they shove 40 crab legs down their throat. The cioppino was being stored at a very dangerous temperature. I had one sip and realized it wouldn't be wise to continue eating it. The asian station was a step-up mainly because it was busy so the food was being made fresh. The carvery was good as well, the roast chicken was juicy and tasty. The sushi wasn't bad although it wasn't freshly rolled and the choices were limited. Who doesn't love cured meats and cheeses, can't go wrong at the italian station.",

However after I moved, I was ignored until I was halfway through desert (right before I left).  In general, I kind of like it this way.  I always hate having servers constantly asking you questions over and over when your mouth is full of food and you are trying to eat in peace. However they broke my #1 rule of rules.  One rule to rule them all! Keep my cup full.  Since we are not permitted to fill our own cups like we are at some buffets, this left me rather thirsty for most of the meal, which sucks.  To be fair though, the server did recognize the issue after 30 minutes or so and apologized profusely for forgetting me. It was probably my fault anyways, messing up her groove by requesting a move to another table.  BTW, buffet decor, great! I love the modern, artsy feel to the place.  Plenty of good food and presentation was good. Didn't see any stations go near empty.  I gave it a 4/5. It was an honest mistake in my opinion and other than that blunder, I was satisfied.  PS: this isn't a 5 diamond establishment. Some reviewers want to pretend and rate it like it is. :-/.",

Variety was pretty good at both, but I thought on the whole the food at Aria was much better for just about everything. I tried a lot of different flavors, Mediterranean, Latin, Tandoori, Italian, Asian. Everything was really tasty here. Their Fish Market had some really outstanding whitefish.   The only thing I came away a bit disappointed with was the Asian. I was really looking forward to this, but they came up short here. Generally bland dim sum, rice and stir fry. They need to do a little work on this part of the world, but even so, I think I'd go back for lunch.",

The Chinese station had the best General Tso's chicken I've ever had. This place also has an Indian station, which I haven't seen at others. And the hot bbq sauce at the carving station is good enough to pour all over everything on your plate. The server was prompt with refills, and the desserts are yummy while looking so pretty (usually you only get one or the other).",

We came here on a Saturday at around 1:30 pm and the line was already quite long.  It took us about 45 minutes before we got seated.    WHAT I LOVE: I love that this place is so bright!  It wakes me up from my groggy mornings in Vegas haha!  Also, they have some YUMMY select breakfast foods which I haven't seen anywhere else.  They serve breakfast burritos which are delicious!  And *drum roll please*, HASH BROWNS!  I love me some hash browns!  Not only that, but I indulged like crazy on the crab legs.  Mountains of crab legs on my plate, dipped with melted butter and lemon...yum!  My mouth is watering already.  Service here is also amazing.  Our waitress kept coming by with refills and was just on top of everything!  WHY ONLY 4 STARS: Well, although Aria had endless crab legs for me to indulge on and some delicious breakfast items, I still felt that the variety of food offered here did not compare to say the Wynn or the Cosmopolitan.  We also came here thinking that our lunch buffet was going to be $20 from the yelp reviews, but it turned out to be around $34 each =(  OVERALL: I may come back if I come back to stay at the Aria.  I sure do love great service, crab legs & breakfast food :)",

The regular line up to get in was PACKED, so if it wasn't for the line pass we had, it would've been bye bye to the buffet.  Been here before last year and it seems the quality has gone down. The food was okay, but there really wasn't anything to write home about. They have your standard stuff that can be found in other buffets like shrimps, prime rib, roasted chicken, etc etc. They also have the king crab legs which seem to be the main attraction as I saw many people just having piles and piles of them on their plates. I didn't try the king crab legs as I'm not fond of them in general. I found many of the food to be kinda dry and so I have to put a lot of sauce on them to taste better.  The best part I found was the dessert. They have different kinds of dessert from creme brulee to creampuffs to different flavors of ice cream, as well as brownies, banana fosters, and cookies. I tried the creme brulee and cookies and they're pretty good. Better than the main stuff honestly.  Pop and juice are included in the price, so try to take advantage of that.  Not worth the $30-something for lunch, but ok for the regular $20-something.",

Each time I visited the dim sum area the steamers were near empty and what was inside did not look appetizing.   The sushi was hard from being out too long, again an issue with replenishment.  The salad bar was fresh and offered a great variety. Although I didn't indulge on the baked potato bar, it looked good.  The Carvery left a bit to be desired. The prime rib lacked flavor and was too rare for most.  Again I was scraping what was left in the pan on any of the hot items.  The dessert bar offered some really delicious treats.  I'm willing to cut them some slack due to the Holiday and the size of the crowd.  Hence the 3 stars....",

In other buffets on the trip such as the Mirage, you pay $30 with unlimited drinks. But with the Aria buffet, you have to pay around $40 without drinks. Plus, you would have to wait a long time for the servers to come refilling your drinks. You also have to pay extra tips for those servers. In the Mirage buffet, you can avoid this uncomfortable and inconvenient thing. Overall, it's not worth the money.",

The crab legs, though, were cut/sliced, so you never got big pieces. I guess it was nice not to have to crack it, but it was not very fulfilling to just eat slivers of crab. The shrimp were big, and the cocktail sauce was good.   The rest of it was just ok...the eggs benedict were nice, but the hash browns were soggy and the sushi was mostly rice.

There were a few stations with about 5 foods at each station.  The Asian stop had some decent gyoza, a leak cake, some dumplings, and other fare that looked like low quality take out.  The seafood stand was the highlight with king crab legs that were already sliced in half.  You could easily just pull out the meat.  There were four different types of sushi which were okay and the rest of the fish was overcooked and low quality.  There was a salad buffet, Mediterranean, Latin, and American section.  One star for the crab legs and another for the servers who were very friendly.  Nothing else was really all that impressive.  I definitely wouldn't go back.",

If I had paid full price for this buffet, I'd have been pissed.  The $25 extra we paid was really not even worth it.  Hot breakfast items were lukewarm at best and the dishes honestly just weren't that great.  The husband did enjoy the sushi portion of the buffet and I enjoyed the made to order omelet station.  Other than that, though...not a fan.",

Prime rib was fantastic and surprisingly lean (the cut i got at least) Shrimp/Mussels and sushi selection was below avg. service also below avg.",

Aria, who's the marketing genius behind your buffet.?   drop the joke portion of lobster and double your buffet selection.    even the \"taste\" of the food items is average.  CLOSING rationalize this...   you're competing against MANY other buffets and you want to stand out how.??",

The station for omelette's was closed, the rest of the options were old and bland.  I almost asked for a refund because the food items were not appealing and I couldn't eat it if you paid me to, but I thought I'd get my money's worth with dessert... To no ones surprise, dessert was just as bad as brunch, if not worse.  The service was also way below par for a resort such as the Aria.  Seeing most of the other reviews in here, I doubt I just went in on an \"off day\" . Quality dining establishments do not have off days.  This place needs to be on the show restaurant impossible, it lacks in every department.",

The buffet seemed to have 50% salad items. There's about over 10 kinds of salads and not enough variety for other things. I guess the best way to get your money's worth is loading up with the crabs. The sushi is buffet quality,( not the greatest)  rice was a little hard but I am very much fond of the dessert counter. Lots to choose from, but the best one would the banana cream pie.   TIP* I guess in any buffets here Vegas come a little early and beat the crowd. Preferably around 5:30- 7pm. Who likes to wait in line when you're starving right?",

It was $28 a person plus an additional $6 for all you can drink mimosas.  I had a voucher for $20 off for staying at an MGM hotel so the price was definitely worth it.  Food was your standard Las Vegas brunch fare.  Crab legs, shrimp, breakfast foods, Asian dishes, made to order omelets, and a carving station.  The eggs benedict was a hit and miss for me.  The first batch had perfectly poached eggs, while the other batch I had was a bit overcooked.  Could have been the result of sitting out under a heat lamp.  The top round was mediocre.  I enjoyed the french toast with white chocolate creme anglaise.  The only dessert I tried was the strawberry cheesecake which I found to be okay.  The all you can drink mimosas were great.  My waitress kept filling my glass, and although it was some cheap champagne, who cares.  It got me feeling good at 11 in the morning so it fulfilled its purpose.  Even without a $20 off voucher like I had, I would say this buffet is still worth the price.",

You got your standard omelette line, fresh fruit, oatmeal, scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, French toast, pancakes, etc.  All that good stuff.  Nothing really stood out for me, EXCEPT for the desserts.  The DESSERTS are another topic.  All their desserts come from Jean Philippe (downstairs), so you know it's got to be good.  The Oreo cream cake, and the raspberry cheesecake are delish!  They also have the gelato out during breakfast, which made me happy :)  Gonna have to check this place out for dinner, since everyone's ravin' bout them crab legs!!!

    "text": "This review compares the Buffet at Aria vs. Bacchanal. Both are excellent. Bacchanal has an edge because it is bigger (with a higher price tag, even for dinner). But Aria is no slouch. We had dinner at the Bacchanal and brunch at the Aria (breakfast ends at 9am, brunch is from 9am-3pm and costs $4 more). Delicious seafood, meats, Asian fare, salads and desserts. Frankly, I don't understand the low reviews. Don't listen to them! My kids (ages 12 and 10) and my husband were completely satisfied. The coffee was awesome! We also enjoyed the smooth R&B, 80s and 90s music selection (and sang constantly while eating). Our server, Alicia, was excellent. She was very attentive and brought fresh drinks and cleared our table without delay. In contrast, our server at the Bacchanal was subpar and seemed overwhelmed. At the Bacchanal, our plates stacked up to the point that it was getting embarrassing, and our server was no where in sight. (I did mention I have growing boys who eat a lot, right?) Give Aria a try! We're so glad we picked Aria over the Wynn.",

The buffet offered selections from hand tossed salads, various types of breads and cheeses, fresh seafood, and different types of meat cooked in every way possible. It's really hard to describe the whole dining experience in detail because of the overwhelming choices at this buffet but one thing I can say is that Aria did not spare on the quality of ingredients.  Highlights of the Meal: Diner- Mac and Cheese with Truffles and the Grilled Cheese with Tomato Bisque Seafood- Alaskan King Crab Legs Poultry: BBQ Braised Pork  Dessert: Lemon Bar and the Gelato!  Quite pricey compared to usual buffets at $45 per person for dinner but the two complementary meals for hotel guests make the bill a bit more reasonable.   Also, if you're planning to come here for dinner I suggest you wait until around 6pm so that the leftovers from the lunch menu are already replaced by freshly cooked ones. My family and I went around 4:30pm so the sushi and seafood looked like they were out for a while. Besides that, the food was delicious and the service excellent, so I give the restaurant 4 stars for giving us a great family dining experience.",

So I surreptitiously spit it out.  I said \"it has no shrimp in it!\"  So onto the next one...that must be a mistake of course. Har gow #2....what....?!!  I spit it out....less surreptitiously. This time I poked at it and tried to assess what was going on. It tasted like shrimp and seafood...but not completely like shrimp and it seemed mealy. Well these two must have been overcooked I surmised. Onto #3.....gag. What? This time I dissected this thing and the only thing I could think is that they have mashed up shrimp with fish cake or fish ball? #4 was the same...I couldn't even go to #5. By the way, the har gow was not disappearing off the buffett like last time. Aria, you definitely saved money by preparing it this way...please don't call it har gow!  The seafood saves this buffet though. We chowed down on snow crab legs which were surprisingly tasty for as small as they were...not too salty and seemingly fresh. We also feasted on well prepared shrimp, clams and mussels. They even have crawfish or \"mudbugs\" like they say down in Louisiana. We splurged on the all you can drink package for 13 bucks....quite a deal but it does take a little while to get your beverages.   While I still think they have one of the better seafood selections, not sure I would return knowing that they cheapened the har gow.",

Their pizza is very good (and this is coming from a former NYC-area resident). They have some sushi (but not made in front of you like at Bellagio) and other international options that are only so-so.  Service is slow to get refills and clear away plates. They do have a nice pasta station, but like so many on the strip, be ready for a ton of oil in the pan.  For the price on a weekend, I wouldn't choose this over some other places. But among MGM, it's still one of the better ones.",

The shrimp on ice, tasted a little funky, not sure if it was off, or just ...I don't know, but not good.  Omelet, was just ok, but they didn't have a huge selection of fillings for the omelet like at the other higher end hotels.    Very little fresh fruit.  Chinese food portion was totally lame, over cooked, soggy.  Wait staff, was slow as well.  Oh, one thing that was very good, was the dessert section.  It looked great, and tasted great as well.  Another thing that was amazing was their sugar free chocolate cookie, amazing.    Overall, if I were to spend $24 on a breakfast buffet, I'd go over to Bellagio or Paris.",

I think the factor that makes it not as great as the Wynn buffet or the Bellagio buffet is that their food is not 'top of the line.'

BUT. there is so much stuff... they had eggs benedict, eggs florentine, crispy duck, oysters, wonton soup, shu mai, sushi, pineapples, watermelon, fried rice, prime rib, lamb, chorizo burritos, waffles, french toast... there was nothing i felt like they were missing.  However, they desperately need to train their waiters/waitresses... We were waiting forever for drinks, we were brought different drinks (after she had placed them on a different table and realized that WE ordered it)... really really horrible.

Before deciding on staying we asked the very friendly cashier if we could \"view\" the buffet. They kindly obliged. We skimmed our way down the buffet, crab legs, shrimp, prime rib, pizza, chinese food and oooo dessert! They had us with the crab legs and dessert =)   They have all the basic offering of most buffets but I felt that they had a pretty nice variety of meats at their carving stations- Prime Rib, Ham, Chicken, Turkey, Lamb and I think Bison? A good variety and it definitely silenced my hunger. A couple of my favorites were the sauteed red snapper, the szechwan beef and dessert bar! Great selection for desserts ranging from fluffy pink marshmallows, chocolate dipped strawberries, brownie pudding, key lime pie, nutella tarts and assorted cookies.   Overall a good experience! Our server was friendly, kept our drinks full and didn't leave us with piled plates on our table. The food while not excellent was good and I felt offered a pretty good variety and quality.   With SO many great restaurants in Vegas it's hard to say I'll definitely be back, but I'm not against it.",

When you walk in, it feesl too Cold.  Entire hotel and food court uses the Energy efficient lighting, that looks like florescent lights, which bring out the cold feeling. And majority of the flooring either a tile or stone finish.  Super modernized, but I think I am used to warmth of carpeted flooring.   Generally, food is Super salty.  Prime rib was Salty, Oyster was not so fresh, over all food quality is somewhat equal to Hometown Buffet quality.  I think, they should charge around $15 for it.    I think Mirage buffet down the street  is about 5 times better for the price that is similar to Aria Buffet.   Would I go there again... Humm, probably not for the food.",

    "text": "I'm sorry, tried this place and I just can't get myself to have liked it completely. Call me a bit spoiled because I'm madly inlove with wicked spoon and the buffet at the Wynn/Encore with their wiiiiide selections. First of all it was way over priced for the food they had out for dinner. The buffet at the Aria reminds me of a hometown buffet back home. The food didn't look as fresh and appetizing. Seafood selection was poor and the sushi was just bleh. When you pay $100 you make the best of it. Thumbs up for the gelato only because I'm a huge gelato fan oh and their selection of meats & cheeses. Other than that you're way better off going next door to the Cosmo at wicked spoon where there's a huge selection of EVERYTHING. Not only fresh, but piping hot like it has just been made, and there's absolutely everything you would want in a buffet plus MORE. So dissapointed in the buffet at the aria. Presentations were horrible, food looked like it has been out for a long time, and it's just over priced when there wasn't much variety. Smh.",

They said the increased price was because it was \"brunch\" pricing, even though it was a weekday.  What the hell!!!  We left & ate a brkfst at a neighboring hotel's buffet",

They had an omelet bar that made them to order, a crepe station but really that was it for breakfast. Rest was seafood, pizza, Mexican food, some dim sum items, salad bar, meat carving station, carb station (mashed potatoes, Mac n cheese, etc) and of course the dessert bar. No raw oysters just a breaded oyster that looked unappetizing so I passed. The crab legs were tasty and not a bad price for ayce crab legs. Our waitress was great too.",

    "text": "On the same trip as my previous review for the Bellagio buffet, we also had more complimentary buffet tickets for any MGM resort so we chose Aria. We decided to go here twice. Once for dinner and once for breakfast. Both times, we had a little bit of a wait to get in. Even with our Elite member line. We had to pay a little bit extra outside of our buffet tickets, for tax for the dinner but not for the breakfast. Once we sat down, a server came over to us and took our drink order. That was different then our experience at the Bellagio. They had a much better spread in general at the Aria buffet. More of a variety and better quality food. Their dessert bar was far better as well. We weren't sure how much to tip, since all they do is bring you your drinks and we only got water. We decided not to tip when we checked in because it's hard to tip before you actually get the service. That is, however, an option. It takes a while to fill your plate because there is so much walking around to do and choosing what kind of food you are going to commit to. I chose a variety and I tried to veer on the healthy side. I would definitely recommend this experience over the Bellagio buffet, I would skip breakfast and go to dinner. Breakfast did not have many options it was more like a lunch. Very similar to the dinner experience.",

The cashier was extremely rude, refused to process our credit card, and indicated we wait at the back of the other line. Honest mistakes are not accomodated..Once we paid, it took another 10 minutes to be seated in a half empty restaurant. This wasn't Saturday night, but Tuesday at 3 PM.

The meat selection is great -- I loved the crab legs and had some of the most tender lamb I've ever tasted.  Our wait was short; there was no line. We were seated quickly and given our drinks (you get them two at a time, which is nice -- less waiting for a refill).  My only criticism was I feel like the vegetable selection could have been better, but honestly, I was enjoying the food too much to really care at the time.  Also, if you are using MyVegas, be aware of blackout dates and holidays. I didn't consider that the Friday before Father's Day would be not only blocked out, but higher priced.  My only regret is that I didn't get to try more.",

But he was super rude and insisted that wad his table. (We had a good table which closed to the food). He ignored us and kept talking to the waitress Yassica on ordering his drinks. We were arguing with him and were about to get the manager involved. Yassica then checked the receipt on the table, which has our name on it, and informed thr dbag that that wasnt his table. He then said \"Oops\" and walked away.   We came here for the food, not to be insulted by other customers there.  In addition, the selection of the food is very limited. It is one of the worst buffet i ever had in Las Vegas. I WILL NEVER come back here again!  FYI, you will find Pho in the italian food section. WTF?",

First of all, when I got to the buffet at 3:30pm Wednesday Hardly anyone were there it took at least 10 minutes before the hostess even look at our party and acknowledge us with no smiles on their faces. Then I ask them if it is possible to seat our party of 6 in a booth because my 4 yrs toddler is super active. The answer was just nope we don't have enough servers for booth you have to seat at a table. Seriously the tables are right next to the booth why can the server turn the other way to serve the customers. Again answer was short with a cold stares nope we don't have enough servers. Now our server came over and we ask her to give us some wet naps for the seafood later and response is nope we don't have that. How about Fanta for drink. Nope. How about some paper napkins then. Nope. Amazing service right! At least you can say I apologize but we currently don't provide them etc. Not just no for everything. We told her we are not very satisfied with her reply and she just says Oh pretty soon you won't have to see me no more I am going home?!?! Finally we are getting our food and my son was moving around the table and one of his shoe came loose and fell under the table. Another hostess immediately came over and yell at us. Yes people she was yelling you need to put his shoe back on it's a health hazard. Wow I was steaming at this point but I still managed to ask her politely May I speak to your manager. Rely was simply they are busy you have to wait. We didn't bother with all these horrible service any longer and we left without tipping. Yes this is the first time ever I didn't tip in Vegas. Now I know why MGM Resorts lay off all these people",

I, personally came for the seafood and it didn't disappoint. The crab legs were on point and kept coming out fresh batch after fresh batch...their salads were perfectly seasoned and the meats were cooked to perfection. A very good surprise was seeing the bone marrow dish. I'm not exaggerating when I say my husband must have had a dozen of them. The crisp bread that comes with it was perfect.

Ended up spending $90 for two people at the breakfast buffet. There was really nothing special. Basic items offered. I miss the chorizo and egg burrito they use to serve. They could have at least decorated for this special holiday.   Best part was the omelet. I would probably choose a different place if I was willing to walk.",

There is tremendous variety of meats ( the fried chicken is awesome...crispy and spicy) salads, Indian...good nan, crab legs - pre split so you can eat lots and lots, shrimp, etc etc. there is Chinese dumplings and rices, some meat and veg and sushi. Of course there is lots of dessert - the sugar free strawberry sorbet is excellent.   Staff was friendly and the entire surroundings were very clean. We are not buffet people, but felt that when in Vegas....do a buffet. We were not disappointed. Great value for the money and very competently and tasty food.",

(maybe I could be a morning person?)  After taking care of hotel stuff, we headed over to the buffet at 10am.  There was a long line of folks waiting to get in, all curious to see what Vegas' newest buffet has to offer. Breakfast buffet is priced at $14.95 (lunch is $30 and starts at 11am)  Despite having an ambiance of a modern day cafeteria, Aria wins extra points for: omelette station made to order, great selection of charcuterie and cheeses, fruit filled crepes (sadly, already pre-made) and a carving station (yes, breakfast!)  Since we timed it right, lunch items were being put out fresh. Mountains of crab legs and shrimp that will tease the eyes and satisfy your taste buds! Definitely the sweetest crab legs I've had in a while. It was nice to see the chef making fresh naan with a traditional oven right in front of you. The Chinese food selection is dismal, the sushi limited and the dessert choices weren't as plentiful as the Wynn Buffet. But the flan has a really pretty presentation and the cream puff with the raspberry sauce perfect.   Contrary to other yelper's experiences, service was prompt and our server worked hard -- he literally had sweat beads on his forehead from running around.  Aria buffet is a must try especially if you pay the breakfast price and stay for lunch!",

Your rooms, your other restaurants, your customer service...everything was up to par until I decided to try your Buffet.  Can I say, major sad face?  My tummy was very disappointed!  Came in for dinner on Sunday and expecting a WOW experience since the price tag was ~$39.  This was NOT worth it.  I thought a buffet was all about dining debauchery with vast selections of food bound to please the most discriminating palate.  I did not find one item I went back for a second helping.  Food was served on the warm side.  The selections were so limited I memorized what THE BUFFET had:  Chinese:  veggie chow mein (so bland), mongolian beef-ish item, spare rib, siu mai and pork bun.  A few cold chinese-ish salads.  (Seriously?? that's all you can come up with?)  Italian:  2 pasta dishes, a pasta bar, and 3 types of pizza.  WTH?  Indian:  Naan, paneer, bland and spice-less tandoori chicken, chicken curry.  Carving station:  Salmon, beef/pork ribs, lamb, prime rib  Chilled Seafood:  King Crab, jumbo shrimp.    The only 2 things that I gave a star for was the desserts and the prime rib.  The food here was very bland, few choices, and way to expensive.  If you're paying close to $40 for a buffet, may I suggest:  Wicked Spoon or Wynn's buffet.   Come to think of it, I'm beginning to feel very upset now...how a buffet can be so bad in a 5 star hotel. ARGH!",

    "text": "I think I went to this buffet like three times in a span of a week while my parents visited, all during lunch because you really can't beat their prices while on the strip for a decent buffet.   We came here specifically for the seafood, it's probably a hit or miss with it though. There are times when I found the crab meat to be super salty, not sure why but then the next day it was just fine so I don't know who it is that's adding the salt, but stop it!   The rest of the food is alright, nothing too spectacular to note. They have a decent selection of dessert but I'll probably only stick to the gelato as the rest of it isn't THAT great at least to me.   So really if you love seafood and don't want to venture down to the M for their weekend seafood buffet, then the one here is just as good! Might cost a bit more, but it's all the time so can't really complain and considering it's on the strip too? I think it came out to $27 per person with tax and maybe tip? I forgot if that was including tip or not but definitely tax. So really it's not a bad price at all.   The service is pretty consistent, it's not bad but if they're slammed it's going to take a bit for you to get their attention. I, for one, drink a lot of water when I'm eating so I usually ask for two or three glasses so I know I'll have something before they get back to our table when it's busy.   I like it overall and will be coming back with family for seafood again.",

And while waiting in the regular line, patrons told us that if we are M life pearl card holders, we needn't wait in the regular line, we can join the \"express line\" instead. Which turned out to be a mistake.   As soon as we switched the line, all we saw was the people standing in the regular line moving along and being seated. Meanwhile M life pearl or higher members just stood there browsing through our phones, or debating whether or not if we're gonna continue the wait. Just right before we were ready to leave, we were finally seated.   To be fair, they do have better food quality than \"wicked spoon.\" And for those looking for crab legs, unpeeled shrimps, or crawfish? This is the right spot! The dessert selections here were a bit underwhelming, and quite truthfully, generic. They served typical buffet style cakes and desserts, even the gelato were quite blend (other than the overpowering sweetness, of course.) And at $46 each person for brunch (tax, tips included,) I thought they can try a little harder.  I honestly cannot fathom why they were holding the M life members while letting regular line people in continuously, wouldn't it be fair to rotate? Overall, I'd say it's your typical Vegas style brunch buffet.",

We ended up eating at the Aria buffet for lunch the day we landed in Vegas, with anticipation to eat at the Bellagio buffet the following day. I was blow away by the selection at Aria. On any given day you can find, at least five types of dim-sum, fried rice, lo mein,  general tso chicken, assortment of sushi, piles of snow crab legs (already split for convenience), steamed crawfish, assortment of pizzas, Indian food, Israeli type mezze, a carving station, and finally a selection of comfort food.   We were pleasantly overwhelmed with all the options, considering it was only lunch. Quite a few items are still a bit bland and will need salt, but that is typical with a buffet and hoping to satisfy many palettes. I think the lunch buffet was around $26 (plus tax/tip), which I made up for with just the crab legs I ate. I kept flocking to the chicken shumai dim sum and shrimp dumplings. The curry chicken and tabouleh were also surprisingly good, but these items won't always be available. I completely over looked the soups, but I was informed there was also lobster bisque.   My only complaint is that the cashier wanted 18% gratuity for our party of 8 to sit together, which perhaps we should have just paid. I thoroughly enjoyed my meal at Aria buffet, which had a shorter line and was miles better than Bellagio's rendering. Eat here, especially if you're hungover.",

About 10 people already waiting in line, which isn't terrible because Vegas buffers usually have a long wait to check in to get seated. About a 10 min wait in line to check in and pay. Got seated next to the jacuzzi facing the pool. The buffet had so many options! I started in the Asian cuisine (which is the first station on the left next to the desserts) my eyes were bigger than my stomach! Pad Thai, rice in a cooker for self serving, pho with all the toppings you can add. Omelet station, pizza station, Charcuterie, multiple cheeses, middle eastern food with homemade naan bread, tahziki, mexican food with pozole! Prime rib, Mac and cheese, sliders, bagels and pastries, sushi, crab legs, salad bar, waffles with whip cream and fruit compote toppings. (Waffles were amazing, kept coming back for more), fresh squeezed watermelon juice, and more!! The desserts were amazing. The muffins were the same ones they sell at the fancy bakery in the casino. Tons of gelato options! Our server was great! Attentive and friendly. Removed used plates quickly to give us more room to get more food. Overall a great experience, can't wait to come back!",

The or meat is pretty good. The other selections just are not that great and lack a little flavor. I do give 3 stars just for the service",

    "text": "Should have looked here, instead of some of the ratings of the top buffets in Vegas. It's 2 stars to me. Value wise, it's not that expensive, and if truth be told you get what you pay for.   1) They have Mongolian, although the ingredients (vegetables, pineapple, water chestnuts etc) didn't look that fresh. The dish was just ok. 2) No shrimp, no crab, no seafood to speak of. Mussels in cream sauce, wouldn't prepare me some without it.  3) The rest of the buffet was nothing special.  Without wheels to take bus to eat here, was a waste of time. I'd rather spend a little more for better food. Will try Wynn tomorrow and report.",

Well when I went I got absolutely no discount, the cashier that helped me was extremely rude and told me I was lucky he gave me any discount on my kids which I had to pay for 1 of the 2 that were aged between 5-12. The buffet was amazing and I paid $60 anyways because I didn't want to disappoint my kids but there customer service here is absolutely horrible. Even the server we had never tended to our table, we had no drinks the whole time there and dirty plates on our table the majority of the time. Bad customer service by there staff was just absolutely horrible. I wouldn't recommend this place to no one",

A lot of places have seafood specials for Friday night or during dinner. I thought the 3 options for king, snow, and rock crabs were awesome. Fully enjoyed the carving station too.  Now with that said, everything else is meh. Especially the Asian section. I would rate all that 3 stars, but overall we had a good time and the staff was very nice.   Tip - Avoid shift change at 3pm.

Our server also came around pretty frequently to check on us, which is a plus!   I thoroughly enjoyed this one and I think everyone should give it a try. It can be expensive though... I want to say it's $45+ per person. But you can get comped out or use rewards for discounts.",

It took us about an hour to get to our turn and another 10 mins to finally get a table. Suffice to say, this placed was jam packed!  Service : Excellent! From the lady who took us to our tables, to the cleaning staff, everyone was spot on with their duties, and despite the mad rush continued to be cheerful about it!  Food : A total contrast from the previous day's experience at Wynn! Variety on offer was plentiful and every dish we tried was perfectly seasoned and oh so sumptuous! Special nods to their Shrimp n Grits, Pork Belly, Mango Jalapeno Sausage, Creme Brulee and Customized Poke Bowls  End thoughts : This was arguably one of the better buffets we've had in Vegas and should certainly be on your list.",

There were a lot of people here so I knew the food was going to be really good. To take the cake, they had one for two bottomless drinks for 19.99. I thought this meant that my husband I would have to pay $19.99 a piece, it turns out that we paid 19.99 for both of us to drink endlessly! We were so excited we gave the waitress a high five.  They had so many different types of food from all across the world! It was overwhelming and I could not figure out where I wanted to start. Everything was simply amazing.  They even have a pass where you can pay $60 and eat here all day. It is totally worth it. Also, I forgot to mention the drinks were really good and strong. This is my first time here. You would definitely be back.",

Lots of variety, I appreciated the organization efforts as far as type of cuisines and having a lot of the smaller plates their own little bowls and saucers is so nice to just grab and go. We showed up about 10:30 AM, just in time for brunch and was able to be seated. We left around 1130 AM and that's when the lines started to pick up. Tons of desserts, ice cream bar and fruit parfaits; things like that. They had shrimp and grits, definitely recommend. Skip the pizza and go for the meat plates instead. We didn't get to try the meatball but they were huge. Loved the little jars of different juices to try. They have omelettes, waffles the usual ordering stands. Don't be afraid to make multiple trips. Only complaint is how people were as far as lines and cutting or reaching over you while you're trying to plate your own food. But overall we would like to come back if we stay at Aria again.",

    "text": "Wife and I were very disappointed in the buffet at Aria. With such an incredible property we were expecting much much more, not to mention the $92 we spent! We had dinner on a thursday evening. There was no line at about 7:30, which is actually a bad sign (meaning not busy so not popular, we should've ran!). I have been to Bacchanal multiple times and there is always about an hour wait, for a reason.   Well the buffet at Aria was awful! We went for the crab, as the hostess on the phone said they had king crab that night, but turns out there is only king crab on weekends. The snow crab they had was the dinkiest tiniest puniest crab I have ever seen in my life! Several others in line were questioning and mentioning how tiny these crab legs were. Seriously go see for yourself the legs are absolutely minuscule I didn't even know they could be purchased in that tiny size. I asked the server behind the counter why the legs are so small he said \"ask my boss, he changed them a few months ago to these small ones.\" It was hardly worth cracking these legs as there is no meat in them.   Everything else we tried was very average. Indian food was bland. Pasta station was cheap. Asian and mexican foods were not good. My tiny cut of brisket was dry and unappetizing. Poke bowl was ok. What a joke. I was embarrassed to have taken my wife here. Do yourself a favor and steer clear from Aria, go to bacchanal or just stay home.",

She had piles of dishes to take back but that didn't stop her from making sure our drinks were filled and our old plates were taken away promptly. I was thoroughly impressed and I hope to see her there again when I return.   Now to the establishment. I loved it. There was a good selection of food and it was all hot and delicious. I especially enjoyed the crab legs and shrimp! The Lamb was my other favorite. The desert bar was amazing, so much to choose from. Due to a medical condition I haven't been able to be out like this in roughly 5 years so this was a real treat and one of those little victories. I had just gotten Married on this day and we chose to have dinner at this place and it was worth it. Thank you.   LUZ, YOU ROCK GIRL! KEEP IT UP!",

There were four of us so we tried just about everything but unfortunately most of the food fell below average.

We wanted extra napkins or different drinks and flagged down someone else and the lady said you guys are not my table. Please wait for your server. Like what???? You can't fulfill a simple request like getting more napkins? I think it's ridiculous that a server can not help a large table if it's not her assigned table.

Alaskan king crab by itself is enough to make me happy.  Then I saw the line! What??!!! Nonexistent??!! Then I got like a local discount! Let's just say it was significantly lower at a rate almost buy one get one free.  Literally waited at most 5 min! I was like OMG I found a new seafood place even if it's on the strip! Until I saw the quality of the king crab. Tiny, dry, salty, and they don't even open the crab leg for you! If you never ate Alaskan king you would know it's a pain to de-shell.  Nothing else really stand out as everything else you can get easily in any Buffett.  Plus no oysters????? Ohh the interior looks like late 80's mall cafeteria with glass cylinders that I'm assuming is attempting to pass for chandelier but cheapens the whole ambience.  Also the view of the pool might be nice if the back of the pool bar didn't cover up most of the pool.  So when you look out of the window it looks like storage shed.  Dungeoness crab was really good, and the service was pretty good for Buffett, so that's where the 2 stars come from.",

    "text": "I had not been to Las Vegas for a few years. In general, I thought I was over casino buffets. My overall thought was there is a wide selection of food at a very good but not exceptional quality. Either the Buffet at ARIA has significantly upped its game since my last Las Vegas trip or I just missed it in previous trips. Maybe, the other buffets in Las Vegas have significantly improved to. In the past, I have tried the Wicked Spoon at Cosmopolitan, The Buffet at the Bellagio, and The Buffet at the Wynn. They were all great and Wynn was my favorite. I was surprised that The Buffet at Aria was the best casino buffet experience I have had to date in Las Vegas.  I went for a weekday brunch. For $28.99, it was a steal. My rating is based on the quality and value of the weekday brunch. I cannot speak to dinner or the weekend buffet. My friend went earlier in the year and highly recommended it. As such, I expected it to be good but not be blown away. I was highly impressed with the quality of the food. The poke bowl section was amazing. The fish was very fresh and the selection of toppings was great. The poke bowl by itself is almost enough to justify the price. I also loved the fish tacos. They were delicious. I also liked the little pho bowls. I am normally picky about my pho but the Buffet surprisingly had a solid one. The Asian themed food was very good overall. In terms of the other food, seafood was solid in general. The cut meats were good. I did not care for the fried chicken. It was a bit dry. There was also an Italian bar. Although I was too full to eat too much of it, I did try one of the big meatballs and liked it. In terms of dessert, it was ok. Nothing below me away but I did enjoy the selection of gelato.",

    "text": "When one thinks of Las Vegas, a classic all-you-can-eat buffet comes to mind. This buffet takes it to the next level. It's seriously what dreams are made of. Every single station that I chose to indulge was delicious. There was an unbelievable amount of food choices, crazy amounts of desserts, and every single carb-and-baked-good you can imagine. We were smart and arrived at 10:40, so we got the breakfast prices and experienced both the brunch and lunch menu.  Here's a tip: some stations looked just 'alright.' Your experience can alter depending on the food you choose. I wouldn't even look at the Asian food station, but their pizza station was the bomb (truffle mushroom and goat cheese pizza? Yes please).  By the way, this place had the best fried chicken I've ever eaten.  Definitely consider this buffet if you're looking for a huge and delicious meal when in Vegas.",

Lunch price of $28 is reasonable for Aria, the Lounge Burger or Five-50 would have cost about as much. The Buffet did not stand out as anything spectacular, not as good as Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal. Service was below average, and I was disappointed that I was seated in the furthest section from the buffet (despite the place being 80% empty), I guess you have to be a VIP to get good service and sit closer.",

The amount of seafood offered from crab legs to crawfish made it a hit to me. The \"limitless cheers\" add on to my brunch was a perfect compliment. You weren't limited to only mimosas, you had Bellini's, Bloody Mary's, rum & coke and a vodka option all included and you were allowed to switch back and forth at your leisure. Pretty awesome if you ask me.  The place was clean, the hostess and staff were friendly and timely.",

It's very bright, with absolutely a galore of bright natural light throughout the whole dining area, if you come during lunch. When I was there, there were plenty of seats, the service was good, with drinks and requests coming in consistently and our requests were made appropriately, although it took a while to actually flag someone down. But overall, little to complain about in service.   The food selection is rather limited when compared to the bounty of the Bacchanal feast. However, no matter what you get, it's all very delicious. The food quality is probably on a higher standard than the one that we got on ill-advised trip to Caesar's Palace; we actually enjoyed even the salad. The standard fare was included, with brisket, prime rib, sausages, desserts, Chinese/Latino/French/Japanese/Mediterranean fare all included. However, I actually enjoyed everything that I ate here and I don't really have much to say in regards to things that you should avoid. I would say that this is a safe buffet - you can come and not be disappointed b/c there is plenty to enjoy and you would like whatever you picked up. Unless you know that you probably wouldn't like it. Then don't blame the buffet - blame yourself.   TL;DR - smaller, higher quality buffet with deliciousness in every bite.",

The only guy that was happy to serve me was the guy at the carving station,  African American gentlemen. Can't remember his name.  Waitress asked us what we wanted to drink.  Doesn't grab us silverware. I had to ask for it. She then says, \"Oh! It's suppose to be set already\".  She didn't refill our drinks.  The food was okay at best.  They had \"portuguese sausages\", I asked the carver is it Chorizo or Linguica? He said to me,  \"the first one\". Lol. It was not as spicy as I expected. It was okay, edible. The only thing I liked was pleased with was the mash potatoes had garlic in them.  I ate the mash & tried everything.  It was all cold & old sitting out.  The chicken pot stickers were awfully bland.  The desserts were pretty good but the Asian man serving gelato was a prick. He had something up his butt. He sees me waiting behind the girl he was serving.  I let her go since she was there before me,  I thought.  She left,  he doesn't acknowledge me.

Yes, expensive but it's Vegas so if you are already dropping $100 an hour on slot machines, then you deserve a good dinner buffet! For 3 people it cost me around $140. Saturday afternoon, no wait, no line, no problem! As soon as we were seated, we went straight for the food! The Buffet has an array of foods from around the world and a chef at every station. I got a little but of everything and I loved it! My favorite though, being a seafood foodie, were the crab legs! They were steamed to perfection! Absolutely amazing! Highly recommend those. You should just grab a plate specifically only for crab legs. They do have a salad bar and a dessert bar! The new York cheesecake was really good and the Gelato tasted so fresh! Yum! Drinks are expensive so if you must get one then get one but other than that I would just stick with fountain drinks or water! It's included with your meal. Enjoy!",

Finally when we were able to flag her down and get her attention she couldn't be nice and said that we had been at the buffet for too long (1 hour and 45 mins) and that she would be no longer serving us and that we needed to leave. Well that did away with the minimal 15% tip I was going to leave. I normally visit this buffet because the food is so good. It was very disappointing that we were treated like that.

Nothing that I personally was wowed about, except for them having stone crab legs, because I love those! Also, the watermelon juice they had was yummy too!",

The great thing is that even with all their options, everything was still full of flavor and held to a higher standard for a buffet. This is definitely a great buffet option for lunch!",

    "text": "Came twice, once for breakfast and once for dinner.  Both experiences surpassed my expectations.  Both visits were busy, but being an mlife Pearl helped make the wait a bit shorter than the standard line.  Not by much, but a little bit.  Both visits the cashiers were the friendliest for an elite-categorized property. Not exuberant but not dull.  Waitress on both visits were outstanding.  Linda was ours at breakfast, and Frances at dinner.  Both had numerous tables but ensured to spend time at each table, whether it was checking in, clearing dishes, or refilling drinks.  The food was very fresh, had lots of selections, and felt spacious compared to the stations at places like Bellagio or Bacchanal (Caesars Palace).  If they have it during your breakfast, the red velvet pancakes are a must try!  For dinner, of course the carving station and crab legs are worth the multiple trips.  Dessert items are very unique like Bellagio, but Aria's does have a gelato carousel with what I counted as 8 different flavors (some were duplicate like strawberry and French vanilla).  One concern I had was the labeling at the stations.  There were many that were not accurate or switched with other items, and some had missing tags altogether.  The staff at the stations were what drops the rating.  There was one gentleman, who had nothing in his hands, walking from the seafood section to behind the tandoori oven pathway.  He accidentally stepped on my foot, but took no notice, and kept going about his business.  At the carving station, the lady looked extremely irate, did huff a few times (unsure if at patrons or not), but did make me more careful to what I asked for.  As a result I did not try all the items I wanted.  At the pizza section, I watched a kid grab with his hands, and the two guys behind the station I overheard talking about how dumb the tourists are and how inconsiderate international tourist children are.  At the salad station there were two older Latina ladies that were cackling and joking around with each other.  While I did enjoy seeing them having fun, I did try to ask a question which took me 3 tries to get their attention as they were deep in their conversation.  They were helpful in answering my questions at least.  Overall, if you don't mind service at the stations, this would be a 5-Star buffet.  Overall service and quality is far superior to other buffets and you get way more than what you pay for as long as you do it right.  If service at the stations matters to you, be very careful with what you do and don't listen in to others so much or you may find yourself with a negative outlook on the overall service that the Buffet at Aria gives.",

If I were just rating the food I'd give them 4 to 4.5 stars.  It was the rest of what gives them 2 stars. My seat was COVERED with food. I'm not exaggerating (check out the pic). It took about 15 minutes before we got any water. I know that it's a buffet, but at $42...you'd think they could staff it better and clean the place up. It was disgusting.",

For a 5 star hotel, the buffet is INCREDIBLY understaffed. Even as we waited in line for over 2 hours, one particular table that we saw did not get cleared for over 30 minutes. After we paid, I could see that the back of the restaurant was empty. As we were being seated, my suspicions were correct, there were so many tables that were empty that just haven't been cleared yet which is ridiculous considering how long the line is. Our waitress only sporadically picked up our plates and that was because she was also busy clearing tables, a job that should be reserved for other people. The item labels, especially for desserts, did not match either. For such a fancy hotel as Aria, I'm shocked that they couldn't even fully staff their restaurant.",

Unfortunately this has happened twice. 2 buffers per night is just too much, opt for credit if you have a choice. The buffet serves the same food every single time, even year to year it hasn't changed. If I was paying the rates they posted during the holidays ($40+ per person plus tax and tip on the low end) I would be incredibly disappointed. Free is one thing: it's really quantity over quality with this buffet. The staff is great and it's pretty clean, but as far as selection and variety, not so great. I'd rather pay more for better options.",

No problem. After an hour in line got through, still just over an hour to close and we aren't slow eaters so we thought nbd. Imagine our disappointment when we saw the almost empty sushi bar, the only dessert left was cookies and gelato. The pasta station had one type of pasta left. Out of meats at the carving station. You name it. I mean I get it. They close in an hour but as I'm sitting here at 845, they're still admitting people and still charging full price. I get casinos make money but buffets are typically where you can go at least eat off your losses. Tonight this was just another loss. If this is how they will be operating now, don't waste your time. Save the money for Bacchanal.",

I even called ahead to make sure they would have the crab legs there on a wednesday - since they were the only one we could find that had those this early (this was a party of 7 coming to LV specifically for a buffet run) and I was ASSURED that there would be crab legs there at 11AM.  Here's the excerpt from their OWN website:  \"Fresh seafood, unlimited crab legs*, fish and chips, paella and more  *Snow Crab, Dungeness and Crab Claw. Snow Crab served daily starting at 11:00 AM (brunch) & 3:00 PM (dinner)..\"  The snow crab and crab legs never materialized. I asked one of the staff where they were, and was told they only served them during dinner. I pointed out that it said on their website AND I called a few days before to confirm that they served crab legs there on WEDNESDAY - and was told that they only had the claws (which were grainy and not meaty at all).   Total bait and switch experience. 7 people were very unhappy with the experience.",

When I found out that the buffet offered crab, I couldn't resist!  Good thing we stayed right next door at The Cosmopolitan as it is just walking distance to Aria. It was $40/person for dinner, which was kinda pricey but being that there was crab & prime rib, it should be worth it.  Glad we went. The buffet wasn't as diverse as Bachannal at Caesars but the prime rib and crab were delicious!!!! They had snow crab legs, stone crab claws, as well as king crab legs!!!! I loved how they were served cracked and sliced in half for easy access to the succulent crab meat. So good!!!!!!!  Make sure you try the prime rib as the serve it bone-in which gives such a great rich flavor to the meat and makes it very moist. One thing that was very unexpected was the pork & shrimp shumai dumplings from the dim sum area. THESE WERE THE BEST SHUMAI DUMPLINGS I'VE EVER HAD!!!!!!!!! SO MOIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!  Verdict:  I would pay a visit everytime I go to Vegas. I was so surprised that I enjoyed as I don't usually eat at buffets. Our server was so nice and hospitable. She had such a great personality and was so funny!!!! Thanks Mary Ann for the laughs and superb service!!!!",

While you may pay a luxurious price for this buffet your experience will not be one of luxury. The servers are dressed like farm hands. The maitre d or perhaps I should say the herder is dressed in a busboy outfit.  As for the design of the facility, think one step up from a lunchroom in a school cafeteria. This  is essentially a harshly lit box that charges a lot of money for poor service.",

If I want to pay $50 for buffet, I'll rather go buffet at Caesar's or Cosmopolitan. I've been here before during lunch and the only difference at dinner is that they added prime rib and oyster.  This is a $30 buffet at best. Food 4 stars and price 2 stars.",

It was convenient and right there at her hotel though. I rarely buffet and went to Bacchanal a few days before this, but found it was good for $22.  Best things was the snow crab was quality and just as good as the Bacchanal was. The carving station had a roast pork and a beef brisket that were tender and flavorful.  A few of the dumplings from the Asian section was pretty good. I've never seen Indian station at a buffet before, but this had a decent chicken curry. Nice charcuterie selection, the ceviche and my white anchovy/boquerones salad was good. There were a few misses, but minor like the pork belly steam bun was really dried out, I didn't like the satay chicken stick and one of my sushi pieces had crunchy rice.    Dessert wise, the buttscotch budino was really good. I had a few cookies and brownies and whoopie pies that were good as well, but that was the standout item.   Service was alright. Our drinks were refilled for the most part in good time. We weren't in a hurry and were distracted talking anyways.   It's not the largest buffet and gets overshadowed by Cosmo's Wicket Spoon next door, but I thought it was pretty solid. Nothing was really bad, which I can't even say for my experience at WS so if you're staying here at the Aria, I don't think it's a bad idea to try it out.",

    "text": "With all of the buffets on the Strip, there isn't a lack of destinations to choose from.  However, considering how much I like Aria, I figured that their buffet would have to be on my list of spots to check out.  After all, if their buffet can match the hotel, then it must be pretty decent right?  So, after checking out their menu and being decently satisfied, some of my friends and I ended up coming on a Thursday night to give them a shot.    After paying and making our way in, I already started to get an ominous feeling though.  Now, I don't know about you...but I generally get worried when I start having doubts before I even make it to my seat.  Why so worried?  Well, although the spaciousness of the dining area might have had something to do with it, the buffet seemed pretty empty to me.  Though I didn't expect it to be a madhouse like how it is at some Asian buffets, I figured there would at least be a steady stream of people shuttling back and forth between the food and their tables.  In this case, not so much.   Refreshing as it was to be able to reach for the serving utensil without someone right on my ass waiting for me to finish, it made me wonder if all those missing people knew something I didn't.    Like most Vegas buffets, they have a decent variety of selections to cover just about every diner that should pass through the place.  From the usual buffet staples to Asian selections to Mexican food, they cover a lot of territory.  The question isn't so much what you want, but what is worth eating - like your choices, the quality varies as well.  For the most part, the food is fine - nothing terrible, but nothing that drives you back up there for seconds or thirds.  The Mexican food was pretty bad, though I like the chips and guacamole/salsa bar.  Then again, at a Vegas buffet, that's probably not the sort of thing you want to be chasing.    Among the few things that were of note, I thought that the prime rib was better than average for a buffet.  The seasoning on the outside was pretty good, and it was still juicy and tender.  The star though, if you're a fan, is the fresh crab legs they have.  Haven't seen all of the buffets in Vegas, but it's one of the few that I recall seeing crab legs at, and it's certainly the best that comes to mind.  They were very fresh and tasted great, and it's always handy when they slice it all the way through so it's easier to pick the meat out.  Hassle free crab legs?  Sign me up please!  All in all, the buffet isn't terrible, and it's definitely worth checking out if you like crab legs.  Just that in Vegas, with so many other choices (relatively) close, you're probably better off heading over to Cosmopolitan or Wynn.",

Overall it's a good buffet place considering the price is fair and the selections are good. I will return to this buffet in the future!",

Again, it has several stations for different cuisines - asian (dim sum, noodles, rice, etc.) meats (sausage, ham), omelets (make your own), desserts (cookies, cakes, ice cream), bread, seafood (crab legs), pizza.  I'm pretty sure I've left out a bunch of other goodies, but my suggestion to you is to go to Bacchanal if you want to try the best buffet in Vegas.",

It's not dry like other buffets and seasoned quite well, which is impressive. They have a make it yourself pasta section where you choose the noodles, sauce and meat. I don't eat the mexican and chinese food sections since I detest chinese food and I eat mexican food in San Jose on a daily basis.

The Buffet carries the theme. Due new on the strip no huge, stomach rumbling lines at dinner. Nope walk right in on weekday visit and weekend visit. If you are a supersize me kinda of diner well this will not be the place for you.  Here the buffett doesnot carry the huge selection of the Bellagio, not even close. But what it has here is well done and for the most part tasty. There is an Indian station that one night had tikka massala chicken and another fish jalfrazie and would you beleive a naan oven right in front. Roast Beef, Lamb, Turkey, Pork. A smattering of pastas. A fish or two. Weekend as with hotel rooms and buffets means higher prices. Aria does it different in that they offer each person paying the Friday and Saturday ransom gets table service of a lobster tail plus a glass or your choice red or white.   The tail is not your New England crustacean but more like Naw 'leans crayfish.   Aria gets good marks for trying.  The deserts, though small in  variety compared to the massive sweets of say, the Bellagio's, is actually better tasting and visually more appealing.  Super sized? Nope. Fine dining? Nope. But less feeding frenzy and a good attempt at raising the buffet bar.",

The service was really poor from the check-in to the server (who only showed up once the whole time).  To top it off the food was poor even by buffet standard, especially the sushi.

    "text": "Went there over the weekend for dinner as this was a new buffet in LV.   They adverstised unlimited wine and half of a Maine lobster tail to be included along with your $36.95 entrance fee.    The decor was more like a high school cafeteria.  Quite a let down for such a high end casino.  The service at the table was alright, but the waittress appeared overwhelmed at times.  Thus, service was intermittent.  The service at the stations, especially grilled meats, was horrendous.  The server was condensing and obnoxious.  We were afterall paying for the food (actually too much!)... just serve it over already.    The food selection was quite skimpy. Quality of the grill meat was satisfactory.  Otherwise, there was nothing else worth checking out, except for the sweets.  The lobster, small as it was, was tasty, but missing one of its claws.  We had two lobsters at our table and they were each missing a claw.  Someone at our table thought that the missing claws most likely ended up in the lobster ravioli's they were serving that night.  The red wine was mediocre but the white wine was decent.    I would recommend going to the Bellagio buffet instead eventhough that has also diminished in quality over the years.  You get more bang for your buck, nicer service, and better decor.",

Panda Express has better selection and better tasting food than the Asian food they have laying out in this buffet. Italian food section-they only have fettuccine alfredo that looked like no one has touched. They also have 2-3 diff kind of pizza. Poor guy behind the make your own pasta station looked like he's begging people to make him cook for you. His station looked so plain that you won't even really notice him there. Dessert area, from what most of the reviews I've read..I really thought they would have a lot of selection! Wrong! I guess comparing it to the Wynn buffet...The Buffet at Aria is nothing!   Maybe the only good thing they have here is that they serve Indian food which you don't normally see in buffets. Also, they have good size shrimp cocktails.   The Buffet at Aria...never again. Sorry.",

The food was disappointing. Had the crab claws- was ok - I felt that they sat there for awhile and it wasn't refilled enough. Had the shrimp cocktail - two big shrimps in a small shot glass- pretty presentation and good since the size of shrimp was big. Everything else was cold. We went on to dessert and was not impressed. I had the flan and it was ok. Our waitress was just ok- we had to wait awhile to get drinks. Btw, you pay at first and then get seated. The cashier asked if we wanted unlimited alcohol for $12.99 and based on what I saw I declined. When we we were seated, they had more details about the drinks unbeknownst to me so I wanted to order that. The waitress said because I didn't order at beginning, it would cost an extra $1- what's up with that? Not like the buffet was cheap. By the time she came around, I was full and didn't want to order any drinks. Would not go back again. Go to Ceasar's buffet, more expensive but totally worth it!",

They seem to offer a nice greasy variety for breakfast and for lunch it was random. We must have walked several rounds around the buffet trying to figure out what we should eat not because we were overwhelmed with the selection but because I couldn't figure what to eat with some of the selections they offered. Their mixed salads were extremely soggy and flavorless so there goes my excuse for attempting to eat healthy. I think I would give their dinner buffet a try next time but skipping out on their brunch since the selection was not too impressive during our experience.",

But it would have cost almost $80 for two of us on a Friday night - that would not have been worth it.  Service was good - waitress greeted us with a smile and was usually pretty available - or her counterpart was. Never wanted for beverages.  For the size of their buffet area, the selection is somewhat small. It's really best to walk through the whole thing first to determine what you want for dinner.   Good sushi, decent desserts - but not too much stands out there. My brother loved this place - preferred it over Bellagio. I disagree.",

Honestly, if you're coming to Vegas on vacation, I think it's smarter to just go to Caesars Palace. It might cost a little more but I'm sure you'll get better food and better service. I do not recommend this place!!",

Everyone seemed to go for the crab legs but they had so little meat in them, you'd need to grab a dozen just to have a decent sized portion. The sushi was awful (they only had 3 selections of rolls and the only difference being the spice on top), the \"fresh\" bread was dried out and stale, and they didn't seem to restock on anything until it was all gone (meaning that it took them a while to bring out more). The pesto pasta was good, but it was the only pasta available besides some kind of Chinese noodle pasta. The pizza was also good but unless you get a slice right as they brought it out, it would get cold really fast (the heating plates didn't seem to work very well).  Its like they randomly selected a bunch of different food and hoped it was diverse enough to attract more people.   I had 4 glasses of soda but it only equaled to about 2 glasses because they stuffed so much ice in it.  If you're going to spend a lot on a meal, its probably better to go to a nice restaurant instead of taking a chance on a buffet.",

    "text": "I've eaten at many a buffet in Las Vegas but not necessarily a lot of the higher-end buffets such as Bellagio's.  Mostly this is due to the high cost of eating there when I would rather spend that money on a single entree at a regular restaurant.  Last night I had the pleasure of attending the pre-opening of Aria with all meals and casino play comp'd.  We had the choice of either the cafe or the buffet.  Since there was a huge line to the cafe, we chose to head upstairs and see what was offered.  The buffet is very attractive physically with different levels to the seating area as you move through the room.  The serving area surrounds the room, starting with salad and seafood and moving through the typical, yet sophisticated buffet faire.  It ends with the dessert area which is less substantial than many buffets but did have some good treats.  The food ranges from crab legs and shrimp to veal bollanaise (at least on this particular night), from hummus to asian noodles.  Again, much of the same stuff I've found at the Palms buffet or Wynn's.  Compared to Wynn's buffet, the Aria does not compare in choice for dinner or selection in desserts.  The food was of high quality at Aria but not worth the $30 after taxes it will cost for a dinner here.  Perhaps after the grand opening the selections will change.  There are some issues with people lining up for the seafood when they may not realize you don't have to wait to move around the rest of the room; a bottleneck that almost ends up having people lining up near the entryway.  I would probably come here again only if the meal was comp'd.  If I were a guest at the Aria this would be a good choice for a buffet as there is nothing else within walking distance from the casino (perhaps Bellagio but I've never eaten there) that would be any better, but maybe the walk will build up an appetite that any food can resolve.",

First of all, they don't have a wide variety of foods at all compared to some of the other better Vegas buffets... All of the food is categorized, which made it easy to find everything, but there wasn't a big selection in each category. I found the foods I tried to be OK, but nothing amazing. I had the Indian, Mexican, Japanese, and \"American\" foods (sweet potatoes, casserole), but nothing really stood out. The dim sum was dried out, and the Indian food wasn't very authentic tasting. Some of the foods weren't even hot, just warm. The desserts were pretty good, but the \"gelato\" was really just regular ice cream that you can buy in the supermarket. The worst part was the service... our server brought us each one drink and when we immediately finished them (they give you TINY glasses!!) she avoided eye contact and rushed by us many times, until I literally had to grab her sleeve to ask for another drink. She seemed annoyed that I was asking for a refill. They also didn't come by often enough to take our plates, which is a given at a buffet! We paid $45 each (with taxes and tip) which did not seem worth it... the taste and quality just did not measure up. I don't know how this buffet stays in business.  I agree with the others who have said that Aria is a 5 star resort and this buffet is very disappointing. It is NOT what you'd expect after spending time in the rest of Aria. My husband and I also had high hopes for this buffet, and it failed us! The buffet at Caesar's was amazing.. there's no comparison.",

Seems that we were in the wrong line to pay (prior to being seated) and were barked at by a staff member to stay behind the sign. Once seated, had to wait for about 15 mins before a drink order was taken. Waitress really nice and working at full pace, but clearly not enough staff on. Food was fine and a number of different types - Italian, Carvery, Chinese, Indian, Mexican etc. some staff serving meals -- pasta and Carvery sections were very grumpy indeed. Overall, a very mediocre experience.",

    "text": "This buffet is neither worth $42+ in quality nor quality. There are many buffets on the strip that offer greater quality and selection at cheaper prices. Most of the food looks artistic enough, but the taste seldom matches up. The fresh crab legs, stewed oxtails, pork carnitas and linzer tarts are good, but the pizza, sushi, \"beignets\", \"dim sum\" and antipasti, are not items I would willingly pay for anywhere else. I also don't think I should be paying $40 for three different variations of scrambled eggs with cheese. (And if I was, the eggs could, at the very least, not be overcooked.)  The pros of eating at Aria though, consist of (1.) the pre-sliced/cracked crab legs, (2.) the modern, clean ambiance, (3.) the ease in which the buffet can accommodate a party of 16+, and (4.) the lack of lines.",

We got there fairly early for dinner and I was excited for a free yummy meal.....major disappointment. The pizza looked like it had sat out all day and when they finally put out a fresh one, the crust was limp and not cooked through. The brisket was dry and all the food I tried was under seasoned. Ate at the bellagio buffet the night before an hour before closing and was worried the food would not be fresh...not the case...the best buffet food I've ever had....skip Aria and hit up Bellagio instead. You won't regret it.",

I'm normally way too cheap to pay $38 for a dinner buffet, but my friend offered to pay 1/2 my bill, and buy us a bottle of wine on his work tab. How could I refuse?  You know what? I *would* have paid $38, and I would have been happy about it. The ambiance in the room is excellent - light and bright, but not aggressively so. My friend and I spent a good 2 hours there and could have easily spent more.  Service was top-notch and a bottle of bubbly cost us about $35 - not a bad deal in Vegas. And the food? Oh, the food. Everything I tasted was delicious, and the desserts were divine, and perfectly portion-sized. I'll be back. Oh yes, Buffet at Aria - I'll be back.",

Just tonight tho, there is this lady without her name tag at the front desk yell at me and my family simply because we did not wait at the \"proper place\" while we are waiting to be seated. She yelled at us telling us to stand behind the line because there is only one exit AS THE SIGN said. ( I feel offended cuz she said it in the way as it we CAN'T READ) However, what she did not know is that The main reason we stand outside the line is that whenever we came here after paying the meal at the front desk, they always asked us to stand in front of the line so ppl behind us can pay their bill.  Even if she don't want us to stand over there, she should NOT yell at us !!   There are a group of well dress family in front of us stand at exactly same place as where we were and she didn't say anything.  Idk if she just have a bad day or she is racist or what ... SHE SHOULD NOT YELL AT THE CUSTOMERS!   I THOUGHT ARIA VALUE CUSTOMER SERVICES AND I AM DISAPPOINTED!",

Came here with some friends for dinner.  Only about a 5 minute wait so our timing was good.  There was a long line by the time we left 2 hours later.  Dining area was clean and well lit.  Service was efficient.  I imagined there would be plenty of food stations here similar to Rio's World Carnivale Buffet.  My imagination was incorrect because the selection was not too plentiful.  Still as long as the quality of the food was great, I would be more than happy.  Quality was 3.5 stars in my opinion.  Everything from the crab legs to the ribs to the veggies to the desserts are worth trying.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I hate it when a restaurant doesn't meet my expectations!  Oh well.  I would give them another go in the future.  I won't be expecting as much so there is a good chance this review will be updated some day.",

    "text": "We have been to the Aria Buffet many times over the past 8 or 9 years, but I was a bit complacent sharing reviews on Yelp! until recently.  During our most recent stay, Jan 8-13, 2017, we decided the late morning was a great fit for the plans we'd made on 2 days.  We were greeted warmly at the front check-in and our servers were wonderfully attentive on both on both occasions, this trip AND previously.    I am a big fan of hot tea, and it's the caffeine I just really must have to get my day off to a great start.  I know hot tea is a pain for a server because there is a separate pot of water, tea bags, etc. On both visits, our servers NEVER let my hot tea pot become empty!  Both were ahead of my requests when I'd finish a pot of tea, and had a new hot water and tea bag ready to serve.  This may sound very minimal, but to me, it's HUGE.  In some restaurants, this is not the case and I am lucky to see another pot of tea; but at the Aria,  my tea never ran dry. Thank you for feeding my caffeine needs!  The buffet was lovely.  I don't go to a buffet to eat a ton of food; I go to get a 'little of this' and 'a little of that' and Aria buffet has such a great selection of lovely fresh prepared foods from all over the world, so my little of this and that became a world food event.  For me, it's about QUALITY and SELECTION, not the quantity of food I can eat to just stuff myself for the day ahead.  My favorite thing on the buffet at Aria is the butternut squash bisque.  It is to die for!  Rich, creamy and the taste....INCREDIBLE!  Most people don't eat soup at a buffet; in my opinion, the butternut squash is an absolute MUST TRY for everyone. It is excellent.  The 'beef steamship' is really tasty.  Craved fresh and the taste is amazing.  While the buffet has an enormous selection, as I said, I just want a little of this and that, so I could not try everything.  My husband had the Chili Verde and said it was the best he'd ever had, anywhere, ever.  We've been all over the world, and he's a real taste-master when it comes to Chili Verde, so for him to give it that review, it must be great. If you are into Chili Verde, this one is a must to try.  I tried a few items from the Asian style buffet and everything was tasty and served hot. The Shu Mai was delicious and worth each bite.  The pork buns were great, too, as was the rice, but the rice not quite as sticky as Chinese rice.    The station with foods of India was nice, but I don't go for that curry flavor too often, so that one I skipped, though it smelled and looked delicious.  The seafood station featured mounds piled high of fresh shrimp and crab legs!  Beautifully displayed and great tasting.   The fresh green beans were excellent and cooked  to perfection.  I've made eggs Benedict at home for my hubby, but never had tried it until Buffet at Aria.  I loved it!!!  Cooked to perfection!  There were so many other choices at other stations, but as I said, I just could not eat that much and I know I missed a lot of great tasting foods.  The dessert station is ridiculous!!!  So many choices, all of them amazing.  I know my daughter loves the gellato bar.  I saw it, but just could not fit in another bite.  There is a lovely layered chocolate mousse bar which I found absolutely delicious and the perfect ending to my meal.  Here's a tip that is for everyone.  If you want to just linger over coffee/tea and you know you just don't want to chow-down and rush off, we find it good to give a nice gratuity to your server at a buffet PRIOR to eating.  This practice has always served us well at any buffet.  Many times customers overlook the server, which I think is very wrong.  We tip our server when our drinks arrive and then explain that we will be there to enjoy our coffee and talk a bit, providing there are not lines of people waiting to be seated.  Our servers have ALWAYS been delighted and also accommodate us in every possible way.  Sure, you go to Vegas to have fun and win, right?  Well, we see winning over a very busy server to be a big win.  It makes the server's day better and it's a nice enjoyable time for us.  I know the mindset of some is 'well, I am serving myself so why tip?'  That thinking is WRONG.  The servers are there refilling your drinks, taking empty plates and making your experience the best it can be.  A meal is an event; part of your Vegas experience!  Tip your server well AHEAD of when you leave and you will enjoy a lovely, unhurried meal.  Trust me, if there are 2 in your party, a $20 pre-meal tip will go further than you can imagine.  Try it and you'll see what I mean.  When there are more in your party, that amount should be more.  Yes, it's like a 50% gratuity, but it's totally worth it.  We will be back ARIA BUFFET!  We had a great time and great service!  GREAT FOOD, TOO! Thanks so much.",

Their 'Latin' section had a wonderful single serving huevos rancheros. In the center part they had a single serving eggs benedict. I was really impressed by the pancakes because they had huge pancakes and would cut you a piece of your choosing. Plenty of fresh fruit toppings.  As it was breakfast, I did not have anything from their seafood collection. So I cannot comment on the freshness but it was a very impressive spread.   4 stars for breakfast.

Worst of all is the misrepresentation of \"Bottomless Beverages\" that is advertised.  This adds $20.00 to your bill if you are dumb enough (like most of our party) to not see in the tiniest of print: \"includes endless offerings of the following beverages\".  Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Strawberry Spritzer, Rum Punch.  All cheap fruity cocktails.  Very limited beer and wine labels.  The Cabernet was disgusting.  Service was mediocre as our \"server\" who was guaranteed at least an 18% tip for only bringing beverages, hardly cleared our table of dirty plates. That's it!  All in all, this came to $83.00 a head.  We left hungry, so disappointed and totally ripped off.  Stay away from the Aria Buffet!!!",

They were kind enough to bring out some old, slimy sorbet that was probably from the bottom of an old container. Even some kettle corn would be an option, but nothing. I've heard several people complain about the lack of milk/butter free items available. Time to make a change for the better Aria, your buffet is one of the best so make it even better!",

We went for lunch on our way back to LA from Utah and this place DID NOT DISAPPOINT! Located in the swank and upper crust Aria Hotel, The Buffet is modern and decadent with several dishes from Indian, Japanese, American, Thai, Mexican, Italian...am I leaving something out?! They had a carving table with beef, pork, chicken...unicorn! Fresh crab with hot, succulent chunks of meat, barrels of fresh clams, sushi galore, a gelato station, to die for bread pudding, blondies... I wanna go back like...now!!!!! 36 bucks gets you entry into this wonder place of tasty delights and non alcoholic drinks! An additional 16.99 gets you unlimited Bloody Mary's and Mimosas etc. This buffet is worth EVERY FREAKIN PENNY. I wanted to eat, find a spot to nap and then eat some more. Beef so tender...it melts in your mouth. Seaweed salad so vibrant and seaweedy...one of the best I've ever had. There was no way I could sample EVERYTHING. Waitstaff is very attentive and nice, food was refreshed often. Bathrooms were clean!!!!!! I could go on and on about this spot like a schoolgirl crush but just know I will be back in Vegas to be here. Beautiful hotel, beautiful scenery...u gotta check it out! Forget the gambling...Aria's Buffet is the spot!",

But had a good cut of the prime rib with creamed horseradish and au jus, and a lil bit of mashed potatoes.  That was good.  Also had chicken liver that I ate on a bun, added hard boiled eggs and thinly sliced red onions. For dessert had some gelato, cookie, brownie, butterscotch on a shot glass  - sorry  I am sooo full right now I don't want to get up to check on the name.  Food coma.

    "text": "2014 YELP 365 CHALLENGE - 84/365  For me, this was probably the best buffet I have ever been to. A little pricey but you get what you pay for. And what you get are RIDICULOUS options for your evening of buffeting and phenomenal customer service. We came in for a late dinner on Saturday night and were pleasantly surprised. First off, the decor and ambiance is modern and sleek, with a touch of home-cooked feel throughout. For example, the plates at each station were in fun home-cooked/already used looking pans and plates which made it feel as if you were grabbing some food from your mom's pots and pans back at home. The place didn't feel or look snooty or too fancy at all. One of the best parts of our experience here was the customer service. Our server was so attentive, clearing plates AS SOON as we were done and bringing us refills when we were half done with our current drinks. And our section was completely packed too! We were very impressed. The food was delicious. Macaroni and cheese was one of my top eats of the night! I went back for seconds and thirds for sure. Same with the mozzarella/spinach pizza. WOW, I've never had pizza that good at a buffet before. I thoroughly enjoyed the Indian cuisine. The chicken Masala was as good as I've had it at an Indian restaurant, but the naan was a little dry and tasteless. The Chow Fun was delicious, and the chicken potstickers were good too. On my last round, I realized that they had a sandwich bar that I completely missed with delicious looking options. The dessert bar was AMAZING! They had delicious gelato/icecream that was to die for! The red velvet whoopie was good! I got a pudding pie of some sort that was the best thing I had from the desserts. Overall, It was a great experience, and I'm already making plans to come back with friends when we are in Vegas again!",

    "text": "Came here for dinner twice and lunch once.  We had used MyVegas buy one get one free coupons so it was a pretty awesome deal for us.  But if I were to pay $35 for dinner or $22 for lunch I would have been extremely disappointed.    First dinner was on a Monday night.  Awesome thing is they had raw oysters on the half shell (love raw oysters).  The buffet however was dead.  This meant the turnover for the food wasn't that great.  The seafood stews had shriveled up shrimps and clams from sitting out too long.  Even the cheese tasted bad like it's been there since lunch.  The piece of blue cheese I had was hard for a soft cheese.  Dried up!  So I stuck to an oyster and crab leg dinner this night.  I had also tried the corn on the cob but the corn was so extremely mushy and gross with the caked on mayo I couldn't eat it.    We came again for dinner and I guess because it was a Thursday before Xmas week there were a lot more people at the buffet which meant the food was a lot fresher.  The crab, crawfish, mussels and seafood stews were really good.  But no oysters.  That was a disappointment.  I asked the seafood chef and was told oysters are only served on weekends but any leftovers are served Monday nights.    The Aria dinner buffet is I think $1-2 more than the Bellagio buffet.  If that's the case, Bellagio is much much better.  Fresh food and tastier.  I will complete a review on that buffet as well.    When we came for lunch the menu looked identical to the dinner menu.  We came during CES week so turnover was high and everything was fresh.  With the same buffet menu for lunch and dinner (incl crab legs) lunch is obv better value.    Before you eat just see how busy the buffet is first.  Higher turnover means fresher food.",

    "text": "I think a review of 3 for a ok is about right.    The prime rib was pretty good vs other places I've tried.  I didn't try their other carved meats like their chicken, brisket, ham etc however they all looked delicious.  The mac and cheese and other sides were amazing.  Reason i only give it a 3 is because for a buffet to get anything higher i think the food should not taste like \"buffet\" food.   Especially when your dropping 40 to 50 bucks including tax and tip.   Some buffets do this.   Aria doesn't.   I think for less money you could go to any of the lower end hotels and still get the same buffet and same food.  Aside from the carved meat station and the seafood (crab legs and peeled shrimp) everything else wasn't even good it was average at best.   Mexican food stale.  Asian food stale and horrible.   The rest were standard things like fried chicken breasts potato wedges etc.  If your gonna come here go straight to the carved meats (rotisserie chicken, prime rib, brisket, etc).  Otherwise if your looking for the same quality but save some money go to planet hollywood or anywhere else its cheaper.  I still think rio buffet was one if the best I've had.",

The unlimited alcohol add on is $19.99 for 2 people which I thought was a steal. It includes mimosas, margaritas, rum punch, bloody marys, cranberry spritzers, champagne, beer and wine. The buffet itself was $28.99. The food was just okay. I really wish there were more breakfast options, but what they did have was good. I got a made to order omelet and had sausage, chicken & waffles, and shrimp & grits to satisfy my breakfast cravings. They had both regular and spicy crab legs, both of which were good. After two mimosas, two watermelon lime margaritas, and a Blue Moon, things got a bit fuzzy. We definitely got our money's worth on the drinks... not so much on the food.

We ate there every day while staying at Aria from 17-23 December 2013 due to a promotion where they provided a $68 buffet voucher per night.  The food variety is relatively small to other places but the quality is top notch.  The wait staff is second to none. They were super attentive and friendly and collectively made the best service experience I've ever had in Vegas.  So here's the bad part. Two days in to our voucher deal they nearly doubled the price per person for the buffet. They called it \"Holiday Brunch\" or something like that. Nothing changed (food or service) except for the price which went up $20 dollars per person. The \"free\" buffet deal turned out to be anything but. The place wasn't even more crowded than usual.  I understand Vegas exists to vacuum the cash out of your bank account but the gimmick pulled by Aria's management over the buffet price amounted to cheating their customers.   Don't treat your customers like complete suckers and they may just return with their business. It's no wonder MGM resorts posts billions in losses on a regular basis.",

I've eaten at most of the buffets on the Strip and think this is one of the better ones in terms of food quality and restaurant ambiance (for a Vegas buffet).   I went there about 30 minutes before their weekend brunch was over so there were no lineups to contend with and I could also sample some of their dinner items when they switched over. The food selection was not as extensive as the aforementioned buffet. However, what was there I would say was fairly high quality and authentic.  Even though it was during the switchover period, most of the food were still fresh-tasting.  Only a small handful seems like they were sitting for some time.   Some memorable items included the French toast with a creamy berry filling, prime rib cooked just right, nice sized tiger shrimp, moist baked salmon,  Chicago style pizza, grilled swordfish, and their yummy desserts.    I'll be placing this on my buffets to revisit list :-)",

    "text": "On my last trip to Vegas, I had the pleasure of dining at both Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon, so my bar for excessively expensive buffets was set pretty high.  Before last night, I had never left a buffet hungry.  The quality of the food is the reason for my rating.  Not one single dish was worth a second taste.  It was more on par with Golden Corral than a high end Vegas buffet.  My specific issues:  -The king crab legs were still partially frozen.  Any thick part was a solid crabsicle. -The snow crab legs must have been salted after they were cut open.  It was like eating a salt lick. -The crawfish were completely unseasoned - just boiled.  Do you know what unseasoned crawfish taste like?  Mud!  That's why southerners Cajun them up! -The paella, one of my favorite dishes, was a complete disaster.  It was both overcooked AND cold, they didn't rinse the clams ahead of time so there was a sandy grit to it, and I'm fairly certain the rice was dyed yellow with food coloring, because there was zero taste of saffron. -The lamb was very dry -The grilled prawns were burnt. This was not just a one-off mistake, I waited for 2 other batches to be taken by others before actually taking one myself, and it was exactly as rubbery as I had feared. -The sushi rice was very old and dry -The dim sum, while edible, was a far cry from authentic  I would say the dessert station is the best feature of this buffet, but it's nothing special.  All the desserts are adequate, but nothing I couldn't make myself and certainly nothing memorable or worth the extravagant price charged.  The only redeeming factor was the service.  My waitress refilled my drinks with the speed and stealth of a ninja, and the bus staff was also very prompt in removing used plates.  I wish I could have taken my $43 back from the register and given it to them.  Bottom line - if you want high end buffet and want to pay a lot for it, both Bacchanal and Wicked Spoon are orders of magnitude better than Aria.  If you want a low quality feed trough, the food here is right but the price is not.",

Lots of hot items, pizzas, carving meats, some ok pasta dishes including butternut ravioli and veggie lasagna.  Fair meatballs and broccoli Rabe. They had a middle Eastern bar, including hummus and baba gannoush. The Chinese food was worse than Chinese takeout at home.  Dumplings looked mushy. Desserts were the best items.  Bananas foster, gourmet cupcakes, pecan pie, flan.....all high quality. Cookies, muffins, pastries as well So, if you are in the mood for a great big salad and great desserts, give it a try.

To be fair, it wasn't garbage whatsoever.  Descent upscale buffet with better than average ingredients.  The selection didn't seem as varied or plenty as Bellagio's or The Mirage's buffet though.  The dining area is well decorated...nice and contemporary --- in line with the rest of the Resort's styling.  One really weird thing I have to mention! While eating at a banquette seat, you WILL feel a rattling vibration as you dine which I'm guessing comes from the CityCenter tram.  Terrible design flaw.  We could actually see the surface of the wine in our glasses shiver like the way in the first Jurassic Park film when the terrified kids helplessly watched the water in the plastic cup moving when the T-Rex was stomping towards them.  Other notes: Aria comp'd half our bill (thanks Players Club) and we went when they were serving unlimited red wine and lobster tail (only available Friday & Saturday for Dinner).  Best thing there aside from the lobster tail is the lobster stuffed ravioli. Mmmm.",

That said, we had bottomless wine (of which I only drank a sip because of the heavy caloric intake*) and a 1 lb steamed lobster.  My cousins loaded up on all sorts of fancy meats (think, prime rib, steak, king crab, snow crab) and swore that the prime rib was the best they've had. I, however, had my life changed by one thing that night: the creme brulee.   I devoured six of those suckers. Best creme brulee of my life!

If not, you might be disappointed just because of the competition from other buffets.  * \"this doesn't make sense\" , you're probably thinking. why are you complaining about calories at a buffet?

Actually the more I think about it, I would probably give this 4 stars even without myvegas but  I would never pay full price for this buffet .Its missing a couple of things to put it to that elite, lets gain 40lbs for the night, level.  I went here starving after golf. So I tried a lot of things!  I loved  the prime rib and cut crab legs! I enjoyed the chicken at the carving station as well.  The sushi selections were awful. The Italian station had some great meats and I loved the mushrooms. The mahi-mahi was very good. Loved the sauce it was in. I cant stand most Indian food so I avoided that area as I didn't want to curry myself away in a bag. The Asian noodles were decent. The service was very attentive. Drinks always filled and plates quickly grabbed. Overall I would definitely come again and will probably waste more time on facebook building up to another free meal!!",

The food was delicious. The only thing I had that I didn't think was good was the mac & cheese, although if I had put sold on it myself it would've been tasty. My favorite things I ate were the short rib and mashed potatoes, scalloped trouble potatoes, beef pho, cheesecake dessert, creme brulee, and naan. Husband's favorite things were the crab legs, cowboy steak, short rib and mashed potatoes, and for desserts the fruit tart and creme brulee.   We went at lunch FYI On a Tuesday just after Noon.",

Except for the omelette station, the food didn't appeal at all. Of particular disappointment were the crab legs. They were small and had very little meat. A 3rd rate buffet. When did a Vegas buffet go bad? Aria, a part of MGM Resorts, was surprisingly bad on our short trip to Vegas.",

    "text": "Tried to go here for lunch on a Monday and the lines were very long and ridiculously slow. Now long lines due to demand are totally fine...however, at least a THIRD of the tables inside were completely empty. I was in the \"VIP\" line and they probably took only 3 groups of customers in a staggering 20 (yes, TWENTY) min period. Can't even imagine how slow the normal line was. Lots of people bailed after waiting 15+mins and I can't blame them, I did the same thing. It was a classic \"this is why people hate MGM\" moment.  Now I can only guess at what reason there could be for leaving people waiting outside when a third of the restaurant is empty. My main guess is that the buffet simply didn't have enough servers to serve drinks. This brings to mind a simple solution - either hire more servers OR get one of those automated drink machines so you can get by with less servers. The Bellagio has almost similar demand, but their lines go by much faster, very possibly due to their long-time use of the automated drink machines. Something needs to change though as this isn't the first time there's been an unnecessarily long line in front of the Aria Buffet.  So pay for more people or pay for more machines. Simple as that. Or don't pay and get a bad reputation, along with a loss of people who actually want to pay $$$ to eat at your buffet. Gee maybe you might actually make more money by packing in paying customers by spending just a few more $ on people or machines?  Two stars instead of just one star because the food here is really good - provided you have two hours to kill to make it through the line.",

We had a late show to see Bruno Mars and this is the closest buffet to our hotel. We arrived before 6PM and it was not crowded at all on a Tuesday nite.   I skipped the carving section. Had a bite of Hubbys prime rib and it tasted flavorless to me. I skipped the Latino and Mediterranean sections but tried the Indian section and found the food tasty.   The sushi rice were sticky and mushy. Blah. Crab legs were good and plenty of it. The have crackers but the shells are soft and don't crack open, making getting out the crab meat difficult.   Hubby tried the Asian noodles. The soup didn't taste good to me. I went for the salad which was very good with topping options and 5-6 dressings.   Our wait staff was hard working and very good with refilling his coffee and soda. I skipped the desserts and was too full to try any of his selections.",

You download the game, play, earn points, purchase whatever comp you want with your rewards, use it before the time expires and stop by the Mlife rewards desk in the casino before redeeming your coupon. It's that easy!  Ok -- on to the Buffet. It wasn't crowded when we arrived so there was no line. The Buffet has a huge selection of upscale international food such as Hummus, tandoori chicken , pho, oyster bar, sushi , salad pizzas, carving station, pokey. The desserts were amazing and everything is made fresh, on-site st the Aria . We had a wonderful time. Definitely worth the price, at about $45.00 with the  reward coupon (normally, it's about $80.00).Very  good food and beautiful setting.",

We came here solely because we had a 2 for 1 coupon from Mlife and decided we should try it.  We arrived at 11:30 am and the Line was pretty long but moved at a decent pace. We probably waited about 30 mins.   The service honestly was terrible. We waited about 20 mins for our drink and our plates took forever to clear. Basically we were stacking plates as we ate. We had one server who took care of 8 different groups who seemed overwhelmed. Our drinks weren't filled and the tables around us weren't cleared for 30 mins after different parties left hence maybe why the lines were so long.   The food was okay. For the Asian section the shrimp dumpling was mushy, the pork Bao buns were falling apart in the steamer and  the only dim sum that was decent was the potstickers. They advertise dim sum on their menu but only have 4 types. Lol. The tonkatsu ramen was amazing though. The carving station was good. The steak tender and moist and the sausages weren't dry. The taco station was subpar, meat a lil dry and tAcos required more toppings that usual to be satisfying. The gumbo dish was amazing and so was the clams that was placed next to it. Overall food was probably a 3.5 out of 5. The best thing about all dishes was that they were seasoned perfectly.   Also remember to read the signs. Had no ideas they had made to order oysters!",

I know there are some cheaper buffets out there, but trust me, it's worth it. You're in Vegas, so pay the extra money and don't waste your time at a cheap buffet that will just leave you disappointed. This buffet has everything you could want out of a Vegas buffet, such as crab legs, oysters, prime rib, etc. There's also lots of variety with Asian, Mexican, Italian foods and more. I thought all the food was very well cooked, with lots of flavor. The quality here really is high, and you can tell they actually care about the food they're putting out, which can be neglected sometimes at buffets. Overall, would definitely recommend this place if you love good Vegas buffets!",

No we don't if we are paying for dinner to have it ready on time I mean that is the main reason  people come to this buffet is for the crab so make sure to have that out on time.  We come for the crab not bad and rude service from the staff. We were not the only ones asking about it by the way They have a horrible selection for desserts it's all aimed towards children.

They offered seafood on weekday which is what attracted us to go here.  Big disappointment, save your money!  You pay for parking on top of that they offer no validation for eating there which only makes it worse.    Presentation of food is great but doesn't match up with taste.  Food that needed to be hot were cold to warm at best.  Cheesecake tasted like spoiled watered down cheese.  Sushi was extremely terrible and felt like they went to 7 Eleven and bought up their week old inventory and put it on a tray.  Crab legs that were supposedly hot were cold / warm and surprisingly people ate it as bad as it was.  Guess they just wanted to make their monies worth...   I brought a large party with me of about 13 people with me and they all had the same reaction.  We were celebrating a birthday and this ruined it for us.

The highlight of this buffet was the poke bar, and even though you had to ask for the stuff, the fish was at least somewhat fresh. Didnt care too much for the other stuff here, but I've had worse.",

Asian was the worst!!Mediterranean, the crab and the  clams were ok.    Menudo: The worst of the worst... I don't think they know how to cook menudo properly. It was stinky like a poop!  Pho: it was horrible and super salty like they didn't add enough water to the soup base or something....  Pork bun: the only thing I tasted was old pork fat and something weird taste from the bun... I'm not sure if that's coming from the old flour or something they are using to stream has the smell and transfered to the bun while streaming..  Egg rolls & shrimp dumpling: tasteless and unpleasant shrimp smell  Chow mein: tasteless   I don't understand how it is possible for the executive chef to approve that kind of food to be served to their customer who pays quite a bit of money.  The reasons I have two stars are because of the service and the desserts. I'll give 4.5 for the service and the desserts and 0 for the savory food. I think they have pretty good pastry chef. Don't waste your money and go somewhere else unless you are looking for a dessert buffet.",

The food options were great - there were bowls of pho and Chinese noodles (although first round soup was cold but they warmed it up later), very spicy pad thai, CRAB legs, dim sum, Indian food, Mexican food as well as a variety of meats, sushi, thai teas, smoothies, and clams.  The food quality was good as well.  The pho, although cold was really tasty. Since we crossed over into lunch, they added some sliders and some fried chicken to go with the waffles. They also had gelato and an assorted variety of desserts.    Overall a very good buffet. Only downside is parking is not validated and costs $7!",

This is so not the case with The Buffet at ARIA. Everything and I do mean everything was top notch.  Our hotel stay at the Aria gave us access to the The Buffet daily during our stay. I'm thinking, I have dinner plans, why would I come to an AYCE buffet? Our first day was a travel day and we had no dinner plans. We decided to hit up the The Buffet at ARIA.   We walk up to the register and ask for a table, no reservation needed. Once we're settled and place our drink order, now its on. I walk around the entire facility and scan each station very carefully. My wife starts making a salad. That's great. I come back with a hunk of prime rib with a dash of horseradish as well as a kielbasa link.  That's it. (For the first plate)  My wife pushes her salad to the side. Ooooh! That looks good, can I taste? Sure! What's that, I tell her horseradish and she dips in. Now she's abandoned the salad and ran over to the carving station.   After the meats, we hit up the crab legs. I don't like to get too crazy with crab legs, its a lot of work for little yield. They were pretty good regardless. There are many great items, from the Tandoori Chicken to the Italian station, The Buffet at ARIA has dinner down pat.  I was so full, I skipped breakfast the next day! The following day? Back to The Buffet at ARIA but this time for Breakfast. Fresh Salmon and cream cheese is how I started this buffet. Next, they make a Huuuuuuuuuuge pancake that is cooked perfectly. They cut off a square and serve it to the guests. Pretty ingenuous Aria. Then I had Eggs Benedict, a yogurt parfait and some coffee. I'm feeling pretty good! My wife had an egg white omelet with a bunch of healthy stuff mixed in. We both left stuffed but more importantly, the food being served was high quality. I didn't see any brown gravy with the skin on it. Everything was fresh and tasted great.   The Buffet at ARIA, very impressed with both breakfast and lunch. Highly recommended",

In general, I thought it tasted better than your average Vegas buffet.  I especially enjoyed everything from their carvery section and their whole steamed crab legs.  With the buy one get one free coupon, The Buffet at Aria is a great value and I would recommend it!  To get a free buffet pass or a 2-for-1 coupon, you need to earn points in the MyVegas app which is by MGM.  You earn gold chips for playing their games.  Once you get enough gold chips, you can use them for discounts and freebies at the MGM properties.  You need to be an Aria hotel guest to redeem anything that's completely free.  But, the 2-for-1 coupon is good for anyone to use.  Yes, even if you're not staying at Aria, you can still use the 2-for-1 coupon There are some restrictions and blackout dates so make sure you read the fineprint.  So once you redeem it, you have to go to the Total Rewards booth to get your coupon.  By the way, why does everyone name their buffet, The Buffet. - The Buffet at Wynn - The Buffet at Bellagio - The Buffet at Stratosphere  Anyways, I came for their weekday dinner which was $38 a person. With the coupon, it comes out to $19 a person, which makes it a great deal  When you pay, they give you a menu which shows you add-ons you can get - Unlimited alcohol for $19.99 - 3lb Lobster for $55 - Fish of the Day for $35 - Or a dozen oysters for $26  I don't understand why someone would come to a buffet and fill their stomach with food you have to pay extra for, but it's here if you are craving them.  - 18% automatic gratuity for 8 or more - There's a nice restroom inside the buffet - And stay away from the asian food",

Perfect for two people trying to enjoy some bottomless drinks during brunch. They bring you drinks as soon as you ask and the portions are large per cup! The wait was short and we were seated right away. Our waitress took our drink orders as soon as we sat down and we had our coffee and mimosas right away!    The options at the Buffet were ENDLESS.

We got there around 6pm or 7pm, and there was a very short line, so we didn't have to wait too long.  I think the food looked better than it really was.  I wish they had a bigger selection of hot seafood.  The hot crab legs were a popular item and there was always a line for it.  I got pasta made from the pasta bar with pomodoro sauce, but it did not taste like any pomodoro sauce I've ever had, but it still may be the best thing I ate here.  I tried eating the chilled Dungeness crab, but it was still partially frozen; my fingers were getting really cold.  The Asian food selection was disappointing.   The hot and sour soup was salty, the potstickers had a weird aftertaste, and the fried rice was mushy.  There wasn't any item that excited me.  But at least our waiter was wonderful.",

Dont get me wrong I love children, but I also like well behaved children. Not when their parents leave them to run around the restaurant and touching food with their hands at the buffet. The servers did a horrible job of keeping this place clean. It was hard for us to find a table to sit because the tables were not clean and filled with plates that needed to be carted away. The food was just ok. My favorite station was the Indian cuisine. There chicken marsala, jasmine rice, curry chick peas and naan were the star for me. The seafood station left much to be desired. It was almost as if these were the crab legs that lost the battle. They looked hungry and as if they were suffering. Most of the food at the Asian station needed to be refilled. There was a build your own soup station. I really wanted some fruit but after seeing kids touch the fruit and put it back there was little to be desired. This could have been a bad night but it actually seemed to be a regular theme here and for that reason I dont see myself returning.",

Restaurant felt like a cheap cafeteria. Service wasn't great. We were left without drinks for a long time. Our silverware was taken away from us so we had to hunt for more silverware.  They served king crab legs that were almost frozen and hard to get open with no wet naps.  You'd think for $45 they'd at least provide wet naps. I'll never go back there again and would never recommend this buffet. For $45 you're better off going to a nice restaurant ordering a nice meal instead of a bunch of mediocre food that wasn't really worth the calories.  Update: I changed my review from 1 star to 3 star. I called the manager after our experience and they customer service from the manager was excellent. She said we definitely shouldn't have been left without water nor silverware and understood our frustration.",

Should have left when I got a closer look and thought it was closed but with food left on this long winding station.  The food was OK and it was hot and well marked. Just seemed like a ghost town so I sat by a window near the only other human life forms there. It was fun watching a man pull the crab meat from the claws and put them on a plate for her. Turns out she had really nice nails and he was just a gentleman.  Since I had paid a lot for lunch.... I lingered at the desert station and did find some excellent hot deserts.  Honestly.... This is the most inhospitable and unwelcoming resort in Vegas. I can afford to stay anywhere so just checked out and into a suite at the MGM Grand. Better view and guaranteed vibe.  I did love the futuristic convention center but was stopped by guards for taking photos.",

Aria is also much cheaper than Wicked Spoon, so it's the buffet I like to go to when I do not want to splurge.   The atmosphere is very clean and open, with plenty of comfortable seating. The servers were so wonderful the past two times I have been there, always filling up beverages and having the greatest attitude while dealing with so many people at once. You also never feel rushed to finish your food and leave, the service is so great. The sangria (red and white) is so good here, I still have dreams about it.   The food is solid quality and they have many vegetarian options (compared the Buffet at Bellagio, which had slim pickings for vegetarians). They had tofu marsala, miso soup, and your traditional breakfast items, like pancakes, waffles, and potatoes. Also, the man who works in the dessert section was so personable and knowledgable, it's so nice interacting with people who have such a great attitude.   I just really love everything about this buffet. The drinks are yummy, the food is solid, and the service is fantastic. The Buffet at Aria will always be my go-to buffet when I don't want to splurge at Wicked Spoon.",

The breakfast buffet offered a lot with the options of fresh eggs, already cooked eggs, bacon, waffles, etc. The Asian station at the buffet had dim sum available along with some rice and beef with broccoli. The Italian station provided you with a variety of pizza and the carving station had chicken and steak available. While I felt this was to accommodate the international visitors, I wasn't sure whether the food was kept out until the buffet served at night and was just re-steamed.   I wasn't crazy about the buffet for breakfast or for dinner. The French toast sticks were very hard and some of the breakfast potatoes Weren't cooked all the way through. The coffee, however, was very smooth and tasted amazing.   although I'd like to give this place a 5 star, I can't because of the lack of variety in their food and the quality of some of their food. The carving station had steaks but we're either cooked medium rare or overly cooked to where it was just chewy. The pizza at the Italian station looked very dry and hard and the asian station looked like the food was re heated from the morning.   I would go to another hotel or an outside restaurant for your meals and save yourself the $25/person at the buffet.",

They even have the options of hot and cold, where you get the traditional seafood cold on ice or cooked in awesome sauces, still warm. Either way, both are fresh and delicious.   They had a lot of different stations: -meat carving station with selections of chicken, prime rib, and sausage -a make your own taco and nacho station with choice of cheese, sour cream, pico de gallo, guacamole, salsa roja, salsa verde, etc -Asian station with fried rice, soups, dim sum, general tsao's chicken, and more -cheese station with crackers and meats -small sushi station  I think the best part of the buffet was the dessert. They have a spinning gelato bar, with flavors like coffee, vanilla, peanut butter, Thai tea, and more. The cookies, brownies, cannolis, whoopie pies, and cake pops...everything was good!   Service wasn't an issue for our group. Our waitress was very friendly and attentive to when we needed more drinks or to clear our plates when we were done.   Will definitely come back just for the seafood and dessert!",

The hotel has increased the prices for the holiday time but not bothered to spend an extra penny to make sure there are enough people to cater to the crowd that is expected around the holiday time. There are only 2 staff people at the front while over 200 people are in line. Also, apparently one of the queues is for line pass only and they probably have a tiny sign somewhere that says so ( which you will most likely miss) when there is huge crowd. We stood in the other line for 40 minutes without knowing it was for line pass only and now got transferred to this other huge line that is never ending. If you care to increase the prices for the buffet, make sure you also go the extra mile to make sure everything is running smoothly with enough staff members to assist.",

    "text": "We decided to try the buffet at Aria, since we had seen some sites online that have stated that it has been pretty good lately. We were pleasantly surprised that it lived up to what the sites were saying with some caveats. Everything was well prepared and there were a lot of items that were good, unlike most of the other places around where there is a large variety of items but each is mediocre. On the other hand, if you want variety, there are limited options, compared to places like Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace.  The buffet here is more seafood focused and the warm snow crab legs here were very good, better than the other places we've been to including Bacchanal, Wynn and Bellagio. The cold crab legs were less flavorful, so we ended up sticking with the warm snow crab legs. The prime rib was also very good, again on par or better than the other places we've tried. Other good items included the sliders, and all the desserts we tried were very good. The desserts are larger than the typical offerings elsewhere. They also had a gelato section, which was also very good.   While the spicy tuna hand roll was good, the sushi section was limited compared to other places. There was a small Chinese section with several steamed bun/dim sum options, but we didn't sample these. In addition, they also had a pho section, which we also skipped since we've had disappointing results elsewhere. There was a section on Indian food, including a tandoori oven which made tandoori chicken for dinner. We tried a piece of this, as it was interesting to have this option. Alas, while it looked like tandoori chicken, it was missing much of the flavor in authentic tandoori chicken.  As an interesting aside, they score the warm snow crab legs in the middle which makes it very easy to crack in half without any crab eating tools, then you can pull the crab meat out very easily.  All in all, if you go in knowing that the options will be a bit more limited than some place like Bacchanal, then you will be pleasantly surprised at how many items are actually very delicious, with the seafood, prime rib and desserts all being very strong. This has become my wife's favorite buffet in Las Vegas, with Wynn and Bacchanal to follow in that order, though we understand that things may change in the future.",

The Buffet, along with the rest of Aria, seem immaculate. We've stayed at the Aria before and was impress with the rooms. So it would seem logical that the food was equally impressive. When I took a quick look around, the presentation of the food looked nice.  However looks can be very deceiving. I tried the orange glazed ham. It was dry with no hint of orange. The grilled vegetables were also over done. The clam chowder was ok but nothing a can of Campbell's soup cant replace. I tried the Mexican clams. It was underwhelming and the taste did not go well together. Got a couple of warm crab legs but the meat on it was rather dry. Since we came in the late afternoon we were also able to sample the dinner menu. I was actually looking forward to the King Snow Crab legs but they were equally disappointing.  The only good thing I can say about this place is that the gelato was pretty good.   The service was a bit of a disappointment as well. Since our regular waitress couldn't be found for a good 10 minutes, I flagged down 2 passing servers asking them for the tool to crack open the crab legs. They hardly acknowledged me and as they were walking away one waiter says to the other \"Why me?\" before hesitantly coming back to get me what I needed.   Definitely would not be back here. Living up to its name, this is THE BUFFET to avoid.",

We came on a Friday night and it was rather slow (that should have been a hint) so the wait wasn't long.  The selections were subpar, a lot of the dishes weren't even marked so you had to take a guess at what some of them were.  The paella had a lot of broken shells bits from the clams & crab, the crab legs were cold and there were only scraps of it left in the pans but the biggest disappointment was that there was no prime rib!  The carving station had something called \"cowboy beef\" which turned out to be a dried tough roast.  The rest of the selections were also dry and looked over cooked like it was sitting under the heating lamp all day.  For the price I would have expected to have prime rib which they have served in the past.  What gives Aria? The only saving grace was our waitress that brought the drinks, she was so nice and fast thus the two stars.  Overall I would say don't waste your money, go to the Wynn or Caesars for a good buffet.

    "text": "Everything was delightful. My only complaint was that we dined on a Friday morning (August 29th) for Brunch, and they had already upped the price for the 'holiday' - Labor Day was Monday, September 1st.  $39 for a Brunch is a bit steep, considering most buffets on the Strip charge this much for a Dinner. But once we sat down to eat, I comforted myself with the fact that I would soon be indulging in delightful delicacies for brekky.  Which is exactly what I did. Orange juice and coffee flowed forth on a constantly refilled basis and we had a view of the pool area and greenery which was beautiful. My first course consisted of bagels with butter and cream cheese, croissants and smoked salmon. I moved on to the eggs, bacon, sausages, carnitas (yes, for breakfast), then I dived head first into the dessert section of the brunch offerings. Waffles with bowls of freshly whipped cream, caramel flan, chocolate and vanilla gelato, chocolate and almond croissants. I bellied up to the buffet one last time for another piece of smoked salmon but they had already taken it away to prepare for the lunch items which starts at 11am.  My heart screamed No but my stomach said Yes, I've had enough. Dazed and confused, I finally made my way back to our table with a look on my face of utter satisfaction...sugar, fat, protein and caffeine induced food coma.   I also saw congee and all manner of accompaniments, dim sum, lo-mein, egg rolls, fish, a whole table dedicated to Mexican food, Italian section of pizza and pasta and I was so sad I couldn't eat another thing.   This restaurant is supremely clean, inviting, modern, neat and organized, and being inside the Aria hotel made it even more spectacular. The line was not too long even for a Friday. Since we stayed at the Aria, coming down from our room to have breakfast was a wonderful treat, instead of hiking it halfway down the Strip without so much as a drop of coffee and a parched feeling upon arrival. This was a breeze, convenient and delicious. Thanks Aria Buffet! I felt like I won the jackpot. This has become my favorite buffet on the Strip for breakfast / brunch!",

My slice of prime rib was blue which is not my preference. The ribs were good though as were the deserts I tried except the flan which tasted like egg and the creme brulee which was sloppy.

It was bright, and open, and very appealing.    The server was polite when taking drink orders and clearing plates.  The selection was very impressive.  Curries, sushi, pizza, meats, and LOTS of seafood.  The quality of the food was standard buffet quality, except for the seafood.  I really didn't care for any of it.  The mahi mahi was cold...not even lukewarm, but cold.  The New Zealand mussels were chewy, and the seafood jambalaya was REALLY fishy.  I was very impressed with the fact that they have so many gluten free options.  Everything is well labeled, so there really isn't much guesswork.  My favorites of the night were the salad, the risotto, all the food at the Tandoori station (curries, etc), the chicken pot stickers, and the mac n cheese. Now, I have to tell you..the pasta was WAY overcooked and it was kind of mushy, but that's how I like my \"comfort food\" style mac n cheese.  I actually went back for seconds.    The desert station was huge, and beautiful.  I only had room for a bite or two of cheesecake but that was good too.  I probably would not go back, because I hear that its a fairly expensive buffet, and I'm cheap.  But if you have $30-$50, the quality of the food is pretty standard.",

Nothing worth mentioning here.    * Service - Ordinary  Our server was prompt, friendly and attentive.     * Food Quantity / Quality / Presentation - Somewhat Encouraging (it's a buffet!)  I don't know should I write a review of buffet food or tell you how the food was at this buffet?  Ok I'll do both...  Buffet food: Ambitious!  They are innovative and are trying to do cool things!  Exotic(ish) entrees appear throughout the sectioned-off buffet and new ideas seem to be welcome here as they have small bites and cool combinations available.  For example...  A charcuterie section was a good try.  Tillamook cheddar and cheap lunchmeat slices made it a miss.    Small bites glasses full of various salads was a cool idea.  I tried Thai beef and it was just ok.  (A piece of cheap roast-beef lunchmeat in a glass with some dressing and greens.)  Stunning (looking) desserts will please the eye but disappoint the taste buds (IMHO.)   The food if it were not a buffet:  No good!  For the novelty of a buffet, variety and quantity, this place is your spot.  For good food you need to find another dining experience elsewhere.    * What I'll remember  - The Mecca of glistening desserts - I SO WISH my mouth's experience matched my eyes'!  What I can't wait to forget  The dried out brisket.  The sawdust rice.  The decaying Shu Mai.  The velveeta Mac and cheese.",

The place was very nice with some background music that wasn't too loud.  There was plenty of room to maneuver around.   The presentation of the food in general didn't seem very appetizing.  We came at noon and I expected that the food would be \"fresh\".  Much of the food I got and tried was dried out, either sitting out for a while or over cooked.  For example, General Tsao's Chicken, chicken parmesan sliders, the Grilled Cobia, the country fried steak, the hash Browns,  sweet honey roasted chicken, pork at the taco bar, chicken & jalapeno sausage, and even the meatballs.  I didn't try other stuff because it didn't look very appetizing, especially the food in the Asian section.  The stuff just seemed like it was just slopped there.  The best things I had were the spring mix salad with thousand island dressing and the clam chowder.  The cold snow crab legs were fine because they were cut in half;  why can't the cut the boiled snow crab legs.  Also, the cold peel and eat shrimp was also fine.    The service was just so-so.  You have to pretty much ask for everything because when your drinks run down from tiny glasses, they do not automatically refill them, not once.  I saw quite a few of the workers gathered together just shooting the breeze.  The atmosphere was decent and I liked that there are bathrooms inside the buffet so you wash your hands after eating the shrimp and crab.    I don't eat desserts too often and was told it was just okay.  Just average, nothing special and not much to chose from.  There were quite a few flavor sod ice cream to chose from from their rotating wheel.  I was very disappointed with my food and service experience.",

I redeemed a few MyVegas vouchers for my friend and I.  Buy 1 get one free buffet, and two unlimited beverage passes.  I DO recommend the buffet, I do not recommend the additional $12.99 beverage pass, unless maybe you're going with options like beer, or sangria...options I didn't try during my brunch.  I guess I'll start with that part of the experience.  My friend and I tried a bloody mary - when I asked what the difference was between the two kinds, it was just one was spicier than the other, and they ARE pre-mixed, so nothing special.  We weren't thrilled with them so we got the mimosas...which weren't any better.  The orange juice seemed \"fresh\" with a tad of pulp, but not sure about the rest...it wasn't light or bubbly or anything.  As for the food... we stopped in for brunch.  There weren't a whole lot of breakfast options, but what they had was good...as for the rest, they had EVERYTHING! Italian, seafood, sushi, salad bar, asian, you name it!!! And I can't say enough NICE things about the dessert options, along with a tasty gelato section which had flavors like peanut butter pretzel, and cinnamon toast crunch.  I will say, if you're in a bit of a hurry...and have the drink pass, you do have a 3 hour time limit.  We didn't plan on having a 3 hour brunch anyway, but the service was a bit slow on the beverages so I'd keep that in mind if that was an option you were considering.  Overall, the Aria is wonderful...the buffet is as well, lots of options and very clean!",

Tips are the driving force in the industry right? Well that should have been the motivation but there seemed like none, right off, not friendly, then she was acting like we were a burden on her. Hey working a buffet service industry is tough but if that's what you choose to do then wouldn't you be a little bit engaged with the people you service? Ok that's minus one star.  Next the food seemed to get saltier as the night went on. We got crab legs few at a time at various times and they started to get saltier. Are they leaving all the legs in a salt bath and not take them out at a set time? The tandoori chicken used to be really good where I'd go there and have a plate of chicken. This time is was dry. The lamb stew was flavorful but lamb was dry as can be. Also swordfish, don't get me started. It should have been let go and swam free to save a life not kill it and then kill it again with over cooked fish. Hargow dumplings, mind you I grew up eating them so I'm very particular and know plenty about them since I grew up helping my mom make them, so these were very bad. Like I refuse to swallow bad. The texture just was off and skin was tough. Ok enough with bad there was a lot good as well so I'd give the positive 3 stars based on desert, good curry, great prime rib, tasty ham that wasn't a salt lick.",

The layout seems smaller and more compact than at some buffets which means I think they slightly less variety of food options, but what they do offer was top notch. The carving station BBQ pork shoulder was excellent and the brisket was good as well but a little fatty. I really enjoyed the Mexican fajita bar, with the barbacoa being one of the most tasty buffet meats I've enjoyed in quite a while. If you enjoy like I do you'll like their seafood station. They feature king and snow crab legs which are served hot and cold and were tasty and fresh without being stringy. One older guy who was sucking down crab legs when we arrived and still going strong as we left so he apparently approved of them. The chilled shrimp cocktail shrimp were tasty and the scampi had one of the largest shrimp I've seen anywhere. The desserts were tasty and featured an enjoyable pecan pie and large ice cream selection among other items.  This buffet is a little lacking in selection compared to some others but I enjoyed everything and will return. I'd say this is a 4 star buffet if you like seafood and 3 starts if you're not a fan. With the 2 for 1 special through My Vegas this was an even better deal!",

The crab was meh, the prime rib was meh.   I should have stuck to the rack of lamb, hidden away on the carving line, as it was very nicely prepared. Desserts were decent.  Definitely not a buffet worthy of a $43 price tag; quality really warranted paying no more than $20-$25.",

The waiters will come around to take drink orders and clear plates as you finish eating. The buffet is about $28/person and an extra $16.99 for all you can drink, however the wait staff didn't check our receipts and a lot of people who didn't purchase the drink package were able to order alcohol drinks so maybe skip the extra $16.99. There is also an entire dessert section that had options from chocolate cake and cheesecake to flan and cannolis. My favorite part was the make your own pho section.",

    "text": "Yup a solid three star. Definitely an above average buffet but nothing about it jumps out and says I AM THE END OF HUNGER FOR YOU'RE ENTIRE STAY IN VEGAS! ALL OTHER BUFFETS KNEEL BEFORE ME! PREPARE YOUR PIE-HOLE FOR PIE!  The glasses for drinks are laughably small, i think the coffee mugs hold more liquid. Drink service was a bit on the sorry side as well. Here's an idea maybe if we increase the capacity of the glasses our guests would shut up less about refills! Yeah how bout that! Also heard something about the 'bottomless drinks' being limited to three, didnt cash in on that offer so i cant really verify.  So everything was your average buffet experience. You got Europeans who just love to cut in line or stand in the middle of the damn place or walk and suddenly stop causing you to dodge them or risk bumping them with loaded plates. You got chinese tourists with every square inch of their plate filled with snow crab legs. You got staff looking miserable as they refresh the station that's been refreshed a mere 15 min ago. And the busers who some way some how mange to balance a tray full of your BS while putting up with your BS. Tip these people well...  Meal highlighs include anything cooked in the tandoor. The tandoori chicken was a bit under-seasoned but the tandoor gave it much more flavor. The nan is semi made to order, if you'd like a fresh one someone at hte station would be able to reheat a premade one and even garlic that SOB up for you.   The garlic asparagus in the Italian section as well as the garlic green beans by the dinner section were quite enjoyable and cooked perfectly. Lots of freshness and garlic. Side note, i spent a few years eating in military messing facilities which are set up like buffets but considerably crappier and loads more depressing, unless it's an Air Force chow hall. Due to this, when ever is see fresh veggies that arent part of the salad bar i get all giddy and usually grab a hefty portion.   The dessert section was a bit of a hit or miss for me. The Panna cotta was quite enjoyable where as the red velvet whoopie pies were just bombed out and depleted. The gelato wasnt too bad but there were way too many chunks of ice that added to the texture.   I would go back if they had some kind of special promotion going on but wouldn't go out of my way to get some.   Yelp 100 - 044 of 100",

All you can eat gourmet food including sushi, turkey, crab legs, Indian food, stir fry, assorted meats and cheeses, dim sum and so on.  The list seems endless. All amazing food, with great spices and flavors. To accompany the great food, they offer bottomless drinks for $12.  Well worth it, if you ask me. White and red sangrias were flowing to our table.  As if that wasn't enough for you, they have an assortment of Gelato. I had to roll out of the buffet into the casino.  If you need a great buffet to hit up while gambling in Vegas, go to the Aria!",

    "text": "Vegas buffets tend to be all pretty similar.  Mass produced, widely varied, heat lamped foods that satiate your every food craving but rarely leaves you thinking you had a fine dining experience.  Back in the day, when buffets were $9.95, all of that was fine.  But now, a family of 4 will easily leave a buffet out more than a C-note even if you don't order a beer or glass of wine with your meal.   Aria is on the expensive side even by Vegas standards.   Better selection than most.  Appreciated the Indian food options and healthy portions of pre-cut crab legs that I didn't see at other buffets.  Their sushi was also pretty good but a bit annoying that there was far more sushi rice than fish.  All in all, I'd give the Aria 4 stars as far as buffets go so far as the food is concerned.  However, I feel compelled to ding them a star for their lack of a child rate.  They wanted the same $24.95 (+tax and tip) for my 7-year old daughter's lunch who had all of 1/2 a slice of pizza and a cheerio as they wanted for my wife and I .   I didn't figure that out til after we'd paid for our meal.  Beware future family travelers to Vegas.",

The waitress tried to get us drunk by putting 3/4 champagne in our mimosas...it's not bad, but I'd like to also taste the orange juice.  Food included Asian, Mexican, breakfast and roast beef with the works. There were no tags or signs, since they hand write it on the glass covers...hope you can read their writing.   And as for the dessert? 3 kinds of oatmeal cookies, chocolate whoopie (tasteless) pie, flan, and ice cream. I read the desserts were amazing.........where have people been comparing these to, hometown buffet? They were, at most, subpar.  Not worth the $40+ per person + $6 drink.",

I waited far too long for them to ring me up because of computer issues -- shutting down, rebooting. I feel like there has to be a more efficient way. Then, no one seemed interested in seating me. Two women were chatting in a very intense -- and loud -- conversation while two other workers were trying to get their attention. It was awkward and definitely unprofessional on their part.  The buffet has such variety that it's overwhelming. How about I have some Latin with a side of Chinese and Mediterranean, then feast some more on Italian. I guess I liked the variety, but nothing really stood out.   A few highlights were the guacamole: chunky avocado and tomatoes with some kick. I was expecting it to taste store bought, but it's definitely made from scratch. The tabbouleh was also very good, and I was surprised they even had Korean kimbap rolls.  The desserts were the best part. I indulged in the coffee ice cream (scooped by someone via a giant ice cream wheel), cheesecake and red velvet whoopie pie. It was far too much but all really good. I liked that all of their offerings were mini-sized rather than a full-sized cooke or dessert shot.  The service was also better than I expected. Whenever I left for more food, my plate was gone by the time I came back. And even though I ordered just a water to drink, it was always refilled before the glass emptied.",

They have a big selection of food from different cultures, however, the quality is just not great.  Most of the food I can only give 70/100.  Such as the sushi and sashimi were not refresh at all and not even in good presentation.  Nothing really attracted me except they have a nice salad bar.  Well salad is simple right, just different raw ingredients to be put together.  So I did a simple salad and added a piece of roasted chicken. My husband didn't even feel like eating most of the food.   Comparing to bellagio and Cesar Palace, they have much better presentations and food quality than Aria but I thought Aria is a high-end hotel as well.

All the food was bland, basic buffet food with little flavor or anything special. the ONLY draw would be the crab legs, but those are tiny, the meat is SO hard to get out and its like a zoo at feeding time when they come out, you basically have to fight to get them. not worth it.  A saturday brunch for the 2 of us would have cost $73. Save your money and go somewhere else. Everywhere else we ate in vegas was fantastic but I regret coming here even when it was free.",

For the past 5 years as a resident of Vegas, I've tried nearly all of the buffets in town, including during the holidays.  Dinner tonight, 12/22/15, was priced at $48.99 a person for the holidays. Not a single entree dish was palatable. From lamb to pork belly, poutine to pho, every dish was lukewarm. All the meats were tough & the dishes were flavorless. I don't eat shellfish, but my mil does. She didn't eat some on her plate because she said it tasted off.  Service was spotty - I was consistently out of water & I piled our dirty plates on an empty table because they didn't come by often.  Bathroom in buffet was horrendous. Overflowing trash, empty soap dispenser, sanitary bin in stall so stuffed that the lid couldn't shut, no paper seat liners & a terrible smell was the icing on the cake.  If you want to pay Wynn prices for low tier Stations level food, spotty service and unkempt restrooms,  dine at Aria. Otherwise, stay away from this whitewashed sepulcher and save your money.",

The place was not too clean either which can be expected of buffets but this is Vegas! Atleast that should of been clean! With so many buffets out there I'd go elsewhere.

Best place we ate during our 4 day stay in Vegas. And by the way, use Uber or Lyft everywhere you go, its way better than paying for a taxi or to park, the traffic on the strip is horrible.",

Much like any other buffet, the options are endless, there were quite a few highlights and quite a few disappointments. That is the way of a buffet.  FATTY TIPS: 1. Save ~$7 by going in at 2:45 PM for a mid-day brunch/dinner and continue eating into the afternoon as they bring out the crab and other dinner specific offerings 2. Wear leggings or vv loose pants  TRY THIS: - Crawfish/mussels/clams from fisherman's stew - Steamed snow crab  - Salmon - Blue cheese salad dressing - California rolls - Oatmeal raisin cookie (v crispy) - Chocolate drizzled caramel corn   DISGUSTING, do yourself a favor and skip this: - guacamole - \"paella\" (my friend says \"but put it in quotes, because THAT isn't paella\") - lamb (my other friend says, \"if you enjoy eating your wildlife raw, get this\") - white chocolate mousse \"cake pop\" - pistachio gelato (so artificial) - butter pecan gelato  PS. Desserts are one of my favorite parts of Vegas buffers. Although the cakes were very pretty, they were all quite underwhelming (I tried 6). I wish the cake servings were even smaller, like bite size or something, so that I could try more. And also if you must indulge yourself at the gelato wheel, try the Cinnamon Toast Crunch gelato.",

    "text": "What a disappointment that it's located in a five star resort and Aria is egoistic enough to call it \"The Buffet\" with capital B! Especially considering they charged almost double ($38.99 for just breakfast) for Easter weekend but woefully lack the quality to warrant that price, they seriously need to get their shit together.   It makes me furious that the scrambled eggs at their diner station is MADE OF EGG POWDER. Sure, there's an omelet station nearby so you probably wouldn't be getting your eggs from there anyway, but just the sheer fact that they had the nerve to put an atrocity even a self-respecting $15 buffet won't commit on display really makes me question how they think they deserve their \"exclusively excessive\" slogan. The yogurt they serve is also some genuinely low-quality sugary crap, that I had to spit it out after tasting just one spoonful.   As for their claim to serving \"world wide cuisine\"... it's not wrong, if a small selection of pizza counts as Italian, some lo mien in carry out paper cartons and fried rice that looks like it's been fried for 2 weeks counts as Asian, and half cooked plantains caramelized in syrup instead of brown sugar (which tastes disgusting, btw) plus a taco bar counts as Latin.   The only thing that might help the Buffet justify its price tag is how they serve large shrimps, but even those are hidden beneath piles and piles of mussels and are quite a hassle to dig out. The crab legs that basically blow up in your face in all of their advertisements are nowhere to be seen. Are you saving those for your holiday dinner?",

    "text": "They claim to have king crab legs.  Not exactly.  What they have is cold king crab legs that have been frozen and defrosted cut in half and served cold.  The Buffett is far smaller than what you would expect from a Buffett and the pricing for what is offered is pricey for just okay food.   Don't come here thinking your going to find mounds of snow crab, what they have out is a wok size portion of over steamed crab legs, and bits of claws.  I forgot to mention that is there \"gourmet dinner\" for Friday night.  What was priced nicely is the 2 for 1 all you can drink bar for $19.99.  That gave you an offering of a couple different beers, champagne bellinis, Bloody Mary, and a rum punch, there might have been something else offered but don't quote me. We opted for the rum punch and they were pretty tasty.  Our server who was covering breaks was amazing (Herbie, I think was his name) but the server who came back from her break needed a day off or a nap.  I'd recommend if you want all you can eat crab legs, travel to California and visit Pala Casino and get a real Buffett experience for about the same money you would spend here.",

I also really liked the cold crab legs and cocktail shrimp - sweet and tastes of the ocean. Also, plenty of desserts to choose from - my favorites were the coconut ice cream, the canole, and most definitely the creme brulee!!  The worst items were the pizza and fried mozzarella - the pizza was super oily/greasy, and the mozzarella was cold and hard.   Service was nice - plenty of drink refills and taking away of plates. I'd recommend this place, but would like to try other buffets before returning.",

    "text": "I have to keep this review in perspective, because after eating at a bunch of Michael Mina restaurants and different cuisines on this trip, the food at Aria's Buffet just pales in comparison.   The first thing I didn't like about the buffet was that even though they list menu items on a touch-screen outside the restaurant, the list is not a clear reflection of what they serve that day. We were drawn in by the promise of dumplings, shumai, and other dim sum goodies, but when we went in, all they had were veggie dumplings, sesame balls and pork baos. I struggled with the sesame ball because even though they were bite-sized, they were really tough.   Another interesting station was their noodle bar which allows you to do your own noodle combination of pho, ramen or soba noodles. I got excited because a bowl of tonkatsu ramen sounded like it would hit the spot. But it didn't. The lady behind the counter misheard me and gave me soba noodles instead. The broth was really salty. The pork pieces were decent, but I've had better. There was just a lot of flavor missing besides salt. My fiance went back to get noodles but this time with the proper ramen noodles and it wasn't bad, but we were still disappointed with the salty broth which we fixed a bit ourselves by adding water to it.   The bad items: taquitos, empanadas, veggie dumpling  The good items: beef sliders, naan and the dips in the Greek/Mediterranean section.  There's definitely a variety at this buffet, but I've had better. For example, last year I went to Wicked Spoon and even though the food wasn't that great, it was still better than the food at The Buffet at ARIA.",

    "text": "How times have changed. I was given $100 food credit so my parents and I went here for dinner tonight.  My expectations of this place from last time were average so I was hoping that it was gonna be better. Far from it.  I was hoping to have a decent dinner experience since my last buffet trip at Bacchanal last year was really disappointing.  Where do I begin? Almost all the food I tried tonight really missed their mark. Cold crab legs were salty. Hot ones were ok when my parents brought some but when I went they were barely warm then became cold real quick. Sushi was terrible. Korean short ribs were burnt and had lots of fat on it. Pork ribs had decent flavor but was tough to eat. Pizza was awful and I usually don't have any problems with buffet pizza but the pepperoni slice was off. The only thing I tried from the Asian section was the sesame seed balls with red bean inside and those were tough to eat.  The only decent things I had here tonight were the shrimp and grits and mac & cheese.  But what gets me is the lack of variety in some of the sections. Mediterranean, Italian and Indian sections were poor with selections.  The saving point was the dessert. The rotating ice cream flavors tonight were a huge letdown. Not all the containers were used and some were repeats like vanilla. Dessert section was poor as well.  Service was not that great since our server took a while to get our drinks. And they still use the same tiny glasses.  Overall this trip was a letdown. Doubt I'll eat here again even if it's comped.",

Basically saying, \"I'm not coming back for a while, so I brought you two.\"  The quality of the food is actually really good, but the line to get in, even at 8pm on a Wednesday night, and the price you pay to get snubbed by servers is not worth it.   Pro Tip: if you go here and want to eat the crab, ask for utensils when you order your drinks. If you don't, you will be stuck trying to crack open crab legs with a fork and knife, and since you won't ever see your server again, you won't have another opportunity to get them.",

    "text": "Since I live in Nevada and have had 5days/week access to pretty decent buffets for a long time, buffets generally don't excite me anymore.  This trip however was with a first timer friend and we went for a mid week lunch.   There were expectingly no line at all at the cashier, very friendly, helpful ladies. There were a buy one get one bottomless drink offer going on so we took advantage of that plus I had a 2 for 1 voucher for the buffet as well. So price wise it was unbeatable for us at least.  What I loved the most about the Buffet? It felt spacious and the pool view and extra light was a bonus. The food variety was acceptable. Enough options that anyone can find at least few favorites to go back to. Mine was the mushroom cheese pizza and dolma. The Mediterranean section in general was my favorite.   Just had an issues with our server, it felt like he was deliberately avoiding to notice us! Had to flag him down every time we needed something. Before we leave asked for a beer refill and he rather aggressively ordered me to show him my receipt. He took it and came back with my beer (that was my 3rd glass, not that it matters) . And told me again with a very aggressive tone that this is your last drink you can't get anymore! We were done anyways and were almost about to leave but I asked why is that? And he told  me \"there is a 2 hour limit no more drinks!\"  It's not a big deal I'm sure he was having a bad day or something, and I calmly told him first of all if I want more drinks I will get more drinks and second, we were there for exactly 1 hour 10 minutes! So this was a little bit odd.   Bottomline this was a solid 3.5 star experience. To be honest , I would rather go to wicked spoon next door at Cosmo or buffet at Wynn if I have to pay the full price. But if you happen to score a deal, by all means give it a try and I'm sure my experience with our server was just a one time hiccup.",

And I enjoyed the poke bowl. Things I personally didn't care for were the steamed crab legs which were dry (I got them right after they were cooked) and the papaya salad had no real flavor. A number of items we tried really had little flavor. Many items were not labeled correctly and some others were not labeled at all. Under the sign for menudo was a Thai noodle dish. I think there were lobster sandwiches but was not sure as there was no sign and no one to ask. It is a shame as this was our go-to splurge buffet.",

There's mini sub-sections for Chinese food, Indian food, Italian food, and so forth.  They have your standard fare of snow crab legs, Alaskan crab legs, king crab legs, prime ribs, pasta bars, salad bars, fancy desserts, et cetera.  I like how they have sugar-free items and gluten-free items so if you're on a strict diet, you won't be misled.

Since no food is worth waiting 3 Hours for, we immediately called the buffet at Aria and were told that there was less than a 15 minute wait time. We drove from Caesar's Palace to Aria and directly headed to the buffet.   Pros: 1) Our waitress was super nice. There was no high chair for Ian, so she kept on looking and informing us every couple of minutes that she was still looking. She finally managed to nab a high chair and bring it to us.

    "text": "We all know that the Aria's buffet when they first opened left much to be desired. It was almost Palace Stationesque in terms a food, quality and variety.  I am happy to say since the revamp, the quality has improved. I think that they took a look a whats up the road at the Bacchanal and decide to copy the quality vs quantity theory.   We came here on a Friday night at 6. I expected the line to be insane because of the Zarkana crowd but nope, not a single person in line so there was really no need to break out the M-Life balla status card.  Updates from the previous experience:  They now offer 2 carving stations with various cuts of meat. Much improved prime rib and briskets from the last time.   Indian/ Middle-east station Fresh Naan! I didn't come here for Indian curry but it was on point with most Indian lunch buffet's that surround the strip.   Asian Lots of dim sum selections but note, again I didn't come here for that however I did grab a set of char Siu Bao and shumai. They were decent but a little dried out since they were in the steamer racks for a while.   Kalbi (Korean Short Ribs) were decent BUT.. Beware of bone fragments!! The meat was not cleaned well when it was cut. I ended up finding several fragments stuck on the meat.   The is a dark horse for 3rd best buffet in town (behind Bacchanal for dinner and the Bellagio for brunch).",

    "text": "Came to Vegas and wanted to go to at least one buffet just for the experience. Came to the wrong one....  The service was good, the restaurant was very nice in appearance, and the hygiene was excellent.  The price tag was quite frightful, $78 for 2. They charge extra during \"holiday\" season =December. The \"holiday\" extra charge is for having holiday items which means they have pumpkin gelato and cheesecake...seriously.  We went for brunch.  Meats were flavorless, seafood plain, waffles and crepes dry, eggs nice and creamy, yogurt was yummy, the Indian food was worth returning for, chinese looked very unappealing and tasted generic, the majority of dessert were muffins, croissants, donuts, but they had gelato- best coffee ice cream I've had, and 4 cake options- carrot was dry but the vanilla cupcake was delightful.  Yes I sampled pretty much everything. For that price I was going to make sure I at least gained 10 lbs by the time I waddled out.  In summary, hefty price, not that many options, nothing to really rave about, charge extra for holidays.  It's vegas, there are a lot of options, prices, and sizes when it comes to buffets. Do your homework and decide what's worth your money.",

Found out Aria puts out crab legs for lunch which sold us.  Why pay $40-50 when you can pay $25 instead.  We got there at 2:30 and the menu didn't change when they had dinner switch over so we saved some money by going a little early.  The prime rib was excellent as well. The shrimp and grits was the surprise hit with me.  If looking for a nice buffet I recommend Aria but I also hear there are a couple other good ones as well.  The only thing I would say that should be better is the desserts.  They all look great but just wasn't super impressed with that section.  But let's be honest I come for the main dishes not the dessert and Aria didn't disappoint.",

Damn you Inflation!!!!   5 STARS...if you come in Monday through Friday before 11AM and get the $17 price 4 STARS...if you come in Thur-Fri after 11AM and pay the $25 price  3 STARS...if you come in on Sat or Sun and pay the $33 price...FUC it! Walk over next door to Wicked Spoon for $29.    Sadly...the SD, LA and Seattle Yelp Springbreakers came in on...Saturday! :(  2 years ago it was Alaskan King crab legs...Snow crab now, which are are smaller but just as good.  The tasty prime rib was better than Wicked Spoon's, which doesn't have crab legs. $6 for All-You-Can-Drink champagne, Mimosas, and bloody Mary...did I really spend $39 on Brunch? Guess so!  The service was slow at times with drink refills...I wanna get my Mimosa on! But after 2 hours of eating and Mimosa-ing I was pleasantly buzzed in the end... :D  Moral of the Story? Get your hungover butt down here before 11AM Monday - Friday...otherwise just sleep in and walk over next door to the Wicked Spoon at the Cosmopolitan...unless you just can't live without those pre-cut tasty crab legs...life is full of difficult decisions!",

I think we made a good choice listening to Matt R.   I had alot of hot snow crab legs(these are prob the most biggest snow crab legs I've seen/eaten. So sweet in flavor. I also had the peel and eat shrimp/cold king crab legs (pre-split), ehh. Didn't really care for the cold stuff. I did get my fix on the hot snow crab legs.   Got a piece naan put curry chicken on top it. The fresh tandori lamb just came out of the clay pot, that was all the Indian I had and it was delicious. I also had the prime rib, had great flavor. They had this huge, i mean huge piece of beef (possible a leg of beef). Salmon was also good. Sushi, ehh. Not good, but eatable. Dessert was good. All sorts of sweets.  They'll have something you like. Both of us for dinner=80 bucks. The wait staff was good. Overall worth a visit. If this doesn't convince you to go, think of all you can eat snow crab lags for 40 a person.",

Out of the six buffets I've been to on this trip, I'd be embarrassed if I was the manager or owner. I pulled the manager aside to compliment our waiter, and included in a calm tone how I was not pleased with my visit. Instead of asking why I was displeased, he instead wanted to tell me how he was friends with the waiter. Read my other Vegas buffet reviews.  I'm generous and usually very pleased.  I come here for the shows and buffets. Aria was no better than Main Street Station in Fremont, but three times the price.",

There werent a lot of choices. What was out on the floor wasnt that great.   It wasnt all bad. The dessert was super delish and the presentation was out of a 5 star restaurant. And the staff for the most was very attentive and super nice. And we found the Naan to be superb!   Price point was alright. Except for their fancy Dinner on Thur-Sun. About $46 bucks gets you lobster for two and unlimited wine. They can keep their wine and lobster should have been thrown back into the sea. Bc it looked small, over cooked, and just downright tasteless. I didnt have it as I feared for Poseidon's wrath for eating too much of his sea family already throughout our stay. Sorry little shrimpies but you are too yummy.   But we came for the food. The food was blah at best. So sad for a hotel that screams \"opulence, i has it\" as you walk through the front doors!",

    "text": "Came here on a Saturday night with a group of friends for dinner at around 6:15 pm (by the time we left at 8:00 pm a long line had formed an the entrance of the buffet). Different stations included: salad station, seafood station (hot steamed crab legs, crab claws, raw oysters, crab fish, various sushi, paella, mussels fra diablo, seared salmon, iced cooked shrimp), Asian station (3 varieties of steamed dumplings, beef in garlic ginger sauce, chicken in some sauce as well), various breads and pastas, various cheeses and meats, pizza, and some other stations that I have forgotten. Upon looking around at all of the options I made a dive for the steamed crab legs and the iced crab claws. The steamed crab legs were delicious and salted just right and the iced crab claws were delicious as well. Besides attacking the crab legs and claws (which constituted the majority of my meal) I also tried the osso bucco, which was delicious and resulted in me coming back for seconds. I also had the mussels and clams from the paella, which were cooked well and a couple of pieces of sushi (nothing to wow at).     For dessert I had the creme brulee, which was perfect. Creamy custard with a crunchy torched sugar topping. Caramel macchiato and chocolate gelato with caramel syrup, Oreo cookies, and banana flambe. The flan was good too, but a little too sweet for my taste. The black Forrest chocolate cake was good, the sweetness of the chocolate cake was contrasted with the thin raspberry jelly on top of the cake. I also tried the smores as well as the caramel popcorn which tasted fresh.     Our waiter here was very attentive, friendly, and nice. She also brought everyone 2 glasses of water or soda (depending upon what they ordered) as the glasses are 8 oz, not 16 oz. she was also very quick to refill the drinks when they were close to being empty and was very quick to take away the dirty plates as well.     Caesars buffet, which I also tried, does have a lot more options than Aria, especially when it came to the gelato variety as well as the amount of various stations, but for a $20 difference ($40 at aria vs $60 at Caesars) I would go to Aria as I love my hot steamed crab legs more than I like the iced ones.",

    "text": "I just left the Buffet at Aria, and rather than playing poker or boozing it up, I am in my room sick. Not because I ate too much, because I honestly have never eaten so little at a buffet before. I am in my room because the food at the Buffet at Aria is so bad that it made me sick.  For starters they sat me at a table under a light that kept going out so I had to change tables. I should have known right then that I was in trouble.   I started out at the Asian section for some dim sum. The shrimp dumplings and chicken and pork shu-mai wasn't bad, but the bao was hard as a rock. For those of you who may not know what bao is, it's a steamed bun with chicken or pork instead. The steamed bun is supposed to be soft but these were so hard I didn't even attempt to eat it.  Then it was on to the carving station for some ham. I loves me some ham, but this ham was drier than my napkin. Two bites and I was done with that. I did have some garlic mashed potatoes which were actually very good. Hands down the best thing on the entire buffet.  Over to the Mediterranean  section where they were making fresh naan. Certainly they couldn't screw that up? Wrong. One bite and I was done. It was salty as hell and tasted like that made it with soy sauce, and a lot of it. The falafel was old, stale and tasteless.  Over to the Italian station for some pasta that didn't suck. They also had some decent salami and meats in the antipasto section.  Now time for the main course, CRAB LEGS!! Good size crab legs with decent amounts of meat, but they were old and the shells were impossible to navigate. Made it almost impossible to get to the meat. After a few minutes I stopped trying.  Walked around and checked out some other stuff. The pizza looked decent, but I had pizza in Five50 the day before so I wasn't really into pizza again. There was a sushi section, but it didn't look fresh or appealing at all so I decided to pass.  The one redeeming part was the dessert area. They had gelato which was actually quite good. The other desserts looked good as well, but my stomach was starting to not be happy because of how bad everything else was.  The waitress asked me if everything was okay. I told her the food was not good, she said sorry and walked away. That's good for your tip. And speaking of tips, they had a sign at the front suggesting you tip18%. Seriously? 18% at a Buffet where they just bring you a drink and clear your plates? I usually tip 20% at restaurants, but buffets get 10% tops. Less if I tell you the food sucks and you just walk away.  BTW, did I mention they charge $35 for this atrocity?!?! Wow.   Quite possibly the worst meal I have ever had in Las Vegas...EVER! Avoid this place. There are too many good places to eat to even consider this place as an option.",

The reason for the one star: lots of different cuisine from Asian to Italian, Indian, American and Hispanic and the carving section was the only edible side I can take. The downside is the Asian selection when I was checking them doesn't look good at all. Same with the rest of the cuisine. The sushi selection was very limited. The seafood section is also not a good sight to see. Totally not worth  the money you are  paying. The waitress serving us with drinks was also very rude and condescending. I was thinking of giving her a tip but I decided not to because of how she treated us.",

    "text": "Short:  Slow... slow... slow.... S...L...O...W.... Oh, and did I mention slow?    Full:  We decided to try this buffet since so many people hyped it up to be something it really wasn't. But we stayed at Aria so we though might as well right? We came on a Saturday night and got the two maine lobsters (which weren't great and big at all, more like prawns) and unlimited wine. We paid around $37 per person and I don't feel like it was anything special. The waitress was nice, but very slow even though the place wasn't even packed. It was amazing how slow they were and it was pretty stupid since another waitress passing by could not serve us, she had to hunt down our waitress to refer our request to her. Even for just a simple refill. Talk about inefficient and slow!   The food wasn't really unique or tasty, nothing really stood out. I would go to the Belagio buffet for better stuff and seafood. There were however a good selection of meats (prime rib, ny steak, lamb, etc). The thing that turned me off was the food manager who was throwing an absolute piss fit. Yea, sure the table was messy, but he was yelling at the chef right in front of the customers in line. Talk about total humiliation and making yourself look like a jerk. When you're pissed it shows and people tend to avoid pissed off people or think differently about them.   End:   Overall, I wasn't impress and I didn't get sick. I just felt like I didn't really get my money's worth. No more next time.",

The pricing is not bad, it's like regular buffet's in the bay area which makes it affordable for people. Lots to choose from, and they have crab legs and prime rib for the price they charge. They also offer unlimited mimosa's, it is Vegas...  4 stars, because if it wasnt for the prime rib and crab and shrimp, it would be just like a regular buffet you see anywhere, only in Vegas.  BUT, i would come back or maybe try other buffet's in Vegas.",

We even had the bottomless drink special!! I looked at the drink menu and its more like the bottom barrel list of drinks. If your a bud light person go for it!! Even though they serve them in small glasses! You get a choice between bloody mary's or mimosa for mixed drinks and wine that is chardeney and other few wine choices. For $44 a person you would think a Huge selection of food! Not so much. The Food out of 10 would give a 6 just because even though they are skimpy looking and I mean skimpy and all are over cooked you do get endless crab legs. For the Prime Rib the guy barely wanted to give you a slice! Over all experience we were not impressed please save your money. Thank goodness we got the buy one get one free because it was seriously not worth the money!",

    "text": "So far, Aria is the latest five-star hotel in Las Vegas. However their buffet didn't taste like a five-star. I was so expected and was proven wrong on the Christmas Holiday dinner ($39.99+Tax).  Its buffet is on the 2nd floor (which is hard to find) and there's no restroom near by the buffet. You need to walk to the Viva Elvis theater for it (which is hard to find too). The line was long, but since it's on the 25th, we were ready to wait.  We came in at a large group of 12 and we understand it may be hard to find a table for 12 at a busy time like this, so we decided to split our group into 2 six-people groups and hope it would be easier. The hostess took the first six-people group and then gave us a four people seat! WTH?! When we asked she insisted that she just asked for four people to come in while we actually asked for six, and claimed \"there is no other seat available at this time\" while we can clearly see some other tables for two or four available for combining them and making it six. She even insisted two of us should go back to the front cashier and start all over again. How frustrating it is for staying in the line 2 hrs and cannot get seated in? I immediately asked for speaking to the manager. He responsed very quick and politely provided resolutions, trying to resolve the seating problem. We ended up getting another two seat table separated from the table of four. Although it's not the best solution, I think I could accept that partly because the manager's attitude is nice, but mainly because I was so hungry and exhausted standing in the line. Let me have my food rather than the seating crap.  Originally I assume the Holiday dinner should have lots of selections; however Aria let me down because they only have few selection - Chinese, Italian and Indian. They served crab lag and shrimp cocktail, which is good because I paid more than $40 bucks and expect to see those. They served lamb, which is great because not every buffet served it. But the mint was a bit odd. I would hope it was like the jelly, not the green-looking sauce. As for Chinese dish, it looks like the all-you-can-eat Samwoo (place that sells roast ducks, BBQ porks, shumais etc.) with much less choices. I was not very impressed.  Their dessert looks gorgeous partly because of the glass plate they use. The Yule log is great, while another weird dessert with an tiny oreo on the top tastes like a weird combination of chocolate syrup and Robitussin. They have gelato but I am not a big fan. Not too much fruit to choose.   Overall this buffet is so overpriced especially for its dinner. Not too many food choices here. If you come in with a large group, be prepared because hostesses don't seem to know how to handle large group seatings. If you choose to stay at Aria and wanna have a buffet, do yourself a favor by walking to Bellagio.",

Despite the horrific reviews for The Buffet at Aria, our group had to test out this new buffet for ourselves.  We walked in with virtually little to no expectations and were pleasantly surprised.  Because it was lunch (about $18) on a Monday, the buffet was not crowded, and we were seated prompty.  Everything was spic and span clean, and service was very friendly and welcoming.  The food choices, although not as plentiful as, say, the buffets at Wynn or Bellago, were not bad at all.  And the desserts were especially appealing in presentation and the majority also in taste.  Having visited various buffets on the Las Vegas strip, I really think this one is getting a lot more flak than it deserves.  Nice atmosphere, good service and food, reasonably priced.  Solid four stars in my book.",

I spent a good chunk of time exploring City Center last week, and I hoped to cap off an amazing personal tour by enjoying a buffet that was going to set the bar and contend with the Wynn buffet.  The Aria hotel and casino as a whole, with so much beauty and attention to detail from floor to ceiling, left me captivated and wide-eyed... kinda like watching Avatar in 3D for the first time.   And then came the buffet... ugh...booooooooring.  The wall finishes were tacky and makes you dizzy/nauseous... not good for a meal.  The layout is confusing, with the shrimp located all the way across the dining area from the crab?  How does that make sense?  Trying to control the crowds to make up for the fact the walkway has so little space???  I haven't even gotten to the food yet.  Came between the brunch and dinner to save $.  The food was subpar for what the place advertises.  Prime rib is quality as long as you get the new batch, anorexic king crab legs and pretty plump shrimp.  The breakfast items include a variety of sausages which weren't so tasty.  Sushi (Salmon Nigiri) and Chilean Sea Bass (aka ugly Patagonian Tootfish) came out for dinner.  The only thing that really stands out is that they had a fresh naan & curry food area... something that sounds like a rip-off at a buffet however.  Here's hoping that this buffet is actually secretly still under construction like other parts of City Center....  ahem nudge AHEM!",

I wish there were better words that I could use to describe the home feeling and attention to detail she puts forth in her work. I had to get up and ask for change and personally called her over to tip her, wanted to be sure she received the tip. Kelly, thank you for sharing a little bit about yourself and you really made an impact and difference at Aria for me. You're the reason I WILL be staying at this hotel next time and will be sure to ask to be seated at your tables. Thank you Aria for having employees like Kelly, Yesenia, Ruby and Geraldine the manager. Wish I could give more stars to this rating.

The ham was so moist and tender, and the bacon was crisp. I loved the smoked fish section...three different kinds in addition to anchovies. Delicious!   There were about 5 different flavors of cream cheese. Many buffets just serve those little prepackaged Philly cream cheese containers. I had the cream cheese with chives on my bagel with smoked salmon and capers. Wonderful.   They had a section of pizza...even a breakfast pizza with breakfast sausage and egg. I didn't eat the pizza, but it looked like it was a popular option with many guests.   There was an omelet station and a good selection of fruit. The orange juice did not taste fresh-squeezed, but the coffee was tasty.   We also enjoyed the selection of coffee cakes and muffins. Good stuff.   We'll definitely go back.",

The pasta station was a nice touch, and I enjoyed the shrimp and bacon Alfredo dish the chef whipped up for me, and I definitely enjoyed the cinnamon bread pudding.   They had two types of crab legs- cold king crab, which was already split, and hot snow crab, which was not. I had the snow crab, but with one major issue- no crab crackers! You had to hunt down your server I get them, and by the time I did, the crab was cold. Le sads... The crab was very good, I just wish I had been able to eat it when it was hot.

    "text": "Good price for the money. Definitely a 1 time thing. We did the Friday lunch buffet - which was $25 per person. It was a good mix of sea food, BBQ, and throw in some decent selection for Asian dishes. There was a pizza station, Italian pastas, creo, plenty a salad stations, lots of baked breads etc. I am honestly not a buffet person but once in a while I can test my gluttonous tendencies. So I gave this a shot.   I didn't go near BBQ because I was not ready for a meat fest at 12:30pm in the Vegas heat. But it looked good and I saw quite a decent sized peeps feasting on all the proteins. So it was mostly sea food for me. Mussels (including New Zealand), shrimp, crab legs, crawfish. I took a sampling of the 3 different kinds of Chinese dumplings they were serving. Not bad. Some sea food jambalaya, and as I approached the Mexican table - I could only manage to pick 2 tiny pieces of carnitas.   3 pots of Indian dishes did not look worth trying at all. And sushi was absolutely run of the mill looking. Since we have been spellbound by \"Yama Sushi\" off the strip - I would have killed myself if I went near sushi of any kind. Yama sushi is the best sushi in Vegas.   Coming back to aria. The desserts were super fabulous. And had it not been the decent sea food and the good selection of deserts - I would have given 2 stars. These 2 things are all worth the 25 bucks well spent and I didn't eat a single portion of food till the next day.   Don't fill up yourself with alcohol. Instead have a good scoop of rum raisin ice cream and don't forget the raspberry chocolate moose pop on the stick. I had 3 and they were to die for!! This was my 1st buffet in Vegas and I am glad I tried. Somehow - I will pick all you can eat sushi at Yama over anything else. But for anyone who likes Vegas style buffets, for the price tag - this definitely is a good option (again - depending on how much you can chew and store in your tummy!!) have fun!",

While there was a nice selection from various ethnic tastes (but no Indian, African, or Scandinavian tastes), none of the food was delicious.   It's hard to mess up pig, right? Yet the applewood smoked bacon was tasteless. The ham was tasteless. The pork belly was the only part of the pig that had a bit of flavor. I tried the beef. Sigh. Repeat of the tasteless palette.  The omelette was good. The potatoes were raw. (They cut your individual pancake from a 1'1/2\" foot pancake.) The fruit was in season. I started to go for Dim Sum, but began to feel full off of my tastes.  The service was slow, but saving the tasteless brunch with the milk, water, and juice selections.",

    "text": "My husband and I stayed at Aria over 4th of July weekend and were super excited to try the buffet. Unfortunately we were dissapointed! The food was subpar and to some the selection may have been great, but for us it was strange and not appetizing. I tried the salad bar, which was OK, but the toppings were weird. The mac and cheese tasted like it was made from canned cheese, the pizza was decent and pretty much what I filled up on. The pasta tasted cheap and unflavorful. They had mexican and asian food that didn't look good at all. My husband loaded up on the crab legs that he said were good but the crawfish he didn't enjoy. He also had a slice of prime rib that he said was 'meh'.  The dessert selection and taste were dissapointing as well. We were thankful that we paid the lunch price of $25.99 per person and not the Holiday dinner price of $43.99. Definitely not worth that and barely worth the price we paid! Will be skipping this buffet our next visit to Vegas and will resort to Bellagio or Ceasar's.",

    "text": "We went here for brunch on a Sunday and were pleased with their options and cleanliness. Some of our favorites included the red velvet stuffed pancakes, the steamed crab legs with hot butter, the eggs Benedict station, the chocolate chip with walnut cookies (kind of tastes like the Double Tree cookies.. Mmm so good), and the gelato.   They do not have an overwhelming amount of options, and the presentation is okay. Personally I think other buffets like the Wicked Spoon at Cosmo has cuter presentation for some of their dishes, and they might have a few more options. However, still not a bad deal. Prices are average for a \"nice\" vegas buffet. $24.95 for breakfast Monday-Friday. No breakfast buffet options on the weekends, just brunch for $29.95. Not sure how much lunch or dinner runs; I've been here twice and both times were weekend brunches. Much better than the overpriced Bacchanal buffet at Cesar's, not as overpriced as Wynn (but also less options), and not as cute as Wicked Spoon. But as long as there are steamed crab legs with hot butter, I'm there",

From what I read the crab is open faced on weekends but this was a Thursday and it wasn't worth the effort. The dipping butter was either some sort of cheap imitation or rancid. I mentioned it to the waitress but all she did was take it away. Looking at other tables near us, they weren't dipping their crab either. The carving station had a decent selection but both items I got were cold. The beer brat had a great flavor, though. I won't waste your time or mine commenting on the other dishes. A couple of them were ok, but I really expected more from a high class place like the Aria.",

He was a man of few words but he was on top of anything we needed. Our drinks never went past half empty before we had a fresh one waiting for us. We even had a short period of time where Sonny had to take a small break so another lady replaced him and we definitely did notice the difference in our waiting service which was not a good change. In all honesty if it wasn't for Sonny I would have gave a 4 star but he really did make this experience a 5 star. If your ever at The Buffet at ARIA which we highly recommend be sure to ask for Sonny!!",

    "text": "If I could review this place on the desserts alone it would be a hands-down 5-stars buffet, but desserts can only carry you so far.  And don't get me wrong, its not that the rest of the buffet isn't good, its just that the entrees are hit or miss, some great, but some are pretty mediocre and those waste valuable stomach real estate that you'll miss come dessert time.  Here's a few pointers from this buffet expert: 1. Potstickers are great, rest of the Asian hot dishes can be skipped. 2. Sushi is good, somehow the smoked salmon next to it isn't. 3. Carving station: the ham and turkey are the big winners, ro.ast beef leaves a lot to be desired 4. Skip the Mexican section, surprisingly bland. 5. NO PIZZA IF YOU ARE PAST PUBERTY! Except you may take a slice of the green pizza with the egg to satisfy your curiosity. 6. Crab legs are conveniently pre-cut, so its okay to load up on them since you won't be wasting time trying to crack them. 7. Salads are for chicks. 8. The desserts are served in tiny portions, that can only mean they intend for you to try as many of them as possible!",

    "text": "Came on a Friday night and this place was pretty empty. Should have been a first sign that maybe we should have gone somewhere else. However, for $42.99/person on a weeknight and $37.99 on a weekday, this is one of the more reasonably priced buffets in Vegas.   Before I get anything, I like to take a lap around the place to see what options I have to not overeat a particular type of food. This buffet offers so much variety as it doesn't just specialize in one cuisine. There are separate sections for all types of international cuisines. Having said that though, with experience I have noticed that when a restaurant tries to do so much the food ends up being mediocre but never anything great. And the buffet at the ARIA did just that.   Here are some notable things I had throughout the meal.  -There was a pho station, which was pretty unique. I don't see those often in buffets. -In the back corner, there was a carving station for meat that was nicely sitting under a heat lamp. It kept the meat was nice and tender. -The Italian section was definitely lacking as was the Japanese sushi section. The pasta was dry and overcooked and there were literally three sushi rolls in the Japanese section, a cucumber roll being one of them. Would definitely skip over this. -They have crab legs here! Most of them were pretty meatless but hey they're still pretty expensive so its totally worth it.  -Everything came in small bowls already so it was perfectly portioned controlled so you could leave room in your stomach for everything else! -The dessert section was probably the best thing here. They have beautiful displayed desserts and a rotating gelato stand. So many different flavors to choose from!  Another gripe I have is that you have to pay for parking in the ARIA. When most hotels offer free parking for customers who want to go to the casino or eat at one of the many restaurants in their hotel, this is not an appealing way to attract customers.   Overall, a pretty average Vegas buffet with quality and pricing. I think they are trying to do too much. As much as they are giving customers variety, they are giving up on quality. Definitely come for the crab legs and gelato.",

This is the only buffet in town that has crab legs for lunch. Come after 1pm for the huge beef steamship and Portugese sausage. It doesn't come with beer and wine like some other buffets at this price.  Salad bar is good, with predressed salads that make it more easier for me to eat some greens. Lots of meats at the carving station. Comfort foods like mac and cheese are actually edible. Asian section has some dim sum that's decent. But the crab is the draw here. The cold ones are better, the warm ones are more dry. Get some crab and a bowl of clam chowder. Get some crab meat and put in your chowdah. Eat with a side of fresh naan bread. It's good. Or do what gf does and get a half and half bowl. Half clam chowder and half lemongrass soup.  Just wish the glasses were bigger for my iced tea and they gave paper napkins instead. The paper ones that come with the drinks are so small, and cloth napkins don't really do much on crab hands. Good thing they have a bathroom inside the buffet.",

    "text": "As we concluded our epic Vegas weekend celebration, we had our last dinner at The Buffet, located inside the state-of-the-art and magnificent Aria hotel/casino.  The restaurant is located on the 2nd floor and brilliantly withholds the contemporary theme of the hotel itself.  Upon arrival in the late afternoon, we were greeted by the absence of the line of people in front, but with a warm joyful welcome of the energetic restaurant host.  The pricing is actually excellent compared to any other buffets within the proximity of the strip. (Less than $40/person, depending on lunch or dinner and the day of the week)  The layout of the buffet is nice and simple.  The beginning of the linear path starts off with seafood and sushi, and as you work your way down, there are vast food selections yielding cuisine of different ethnic cultures.  ~ The crab legs were freshly chilled and sliced in half for easy access to the succulent crab meat.  The cocktail shrimp had a great texture, not too firm and not too tender. The sushi quality and selection were good but not amazing.   ~ I also enjoyed the worldly choices of entrees:  The chicken curry was well-prepared and simmered in a rich plethora of exotic herbs.  It complemented the soft and toasty naan bread, immediately making it one of my favorite dishes.  I also enjoyed the tender slice of prime rib, which was rich in flavor.  The selections of the Chinese and Italian dishes were also delicious and enjoyable. ~The assortment of desserts made a great impression the end of our little feast.  Some of the cakes were a little too sweet (such as the Snickers cake), while others were at its optimum level of sweetness.  The macaroons served to please the taste buds with the correct level of coconutiness.  The gelato was also rich, irresistible, and kept calling for our attention even when our stomachs were filled of the hot savory food from right before. The choco-chip cookies were scrumptious... We took some on the way out =]  Overall, this buffet should linger among the top of your Vegas buffet list due to the astounding value and enjoyable food quality.  Look forward to it!",

My friend and I happened to get there at brunch and that couldn't have been better timing! FIRST of all, this place was immaculate. Everything was really clean, which I love, obviously. I love food, but I'm not really a buffet person because they have kind of a grimy vibe to me. Aria was completely different.   So brunch consisted of an omelette station, fresh biscuits and gravy, eggs, bacon, sausage etc. DO not skip the waffles they are HEAVENLY. I was determined to do a buffet right this time and try everything but I stuffed myself with three or four of those babies. They also have crablegs for DAYS which I also went back to a few times. I've never eaten so much crab on my life. It tasted so fresh. Another thing I never do is eat sushi at a buffet but given the clean environment I went for it. Delicious! They did not disappoint. They also have Chinese food which was absolutely fantastic and not super greasy. They had these huge cuts of BBQ'd pork, tri-tip, all different cuts and flavors of meat and they're steaming hot and savory. I still salivate at the thought hah. Another thing I really liked is that they have some Indian curries and chickpea marsala that was incredible. The dessert bar is to die for. They have many desserts to chose from and they are all delightful.   Food lovers unite. This place is definitely worth it.",

I would have thought that the creators of this buffet would take a lesson from places like Bellagio and Wynn, but they obviously were sleeping during class.

The upside is that I think they spent all the time and effort on the dessert section.  The dessert offerings were plated individually and they were beautiful!  They also tasted good.  My favorites were the Nutella cake and the caramel flan.  Ice cream, cookies, biscotti, and brownies were also offered.  Our server was very attentive and nice.  I cannot say the same for the people manning the different food areas.  No one could tell me what veggie was in the chicken curry (I figured out it was spinach).    We went for lunch, and it was $20 per person.  I wouldn't come back here unless they revamped their offerings.",

I took off two stars for the horrible service my group of eight had to deal with. Sure, the person ordering drinks has a thick Chinese accent that may be difficult to understand but that should be no justification for the waitress being completely rude. It takes time for a large group to consider what drinks it wants to order. A waitress should NEVER sarcastically comment, \"Thanks for the long break.\" We are not imbeciles, we understand a sarcastic comment when we hear one even though everyone at the table is speaking Chinese. Not only that, she was rude the entire time we were under her care. In fact, we didn't even get the iced tea that someone in our group had ordered.  Sadly enough, someone in our group got sick right after eating at the Aria Buffet. I'm not going to push all the blame onto the buffet but when the first thing that any of us had eaten was at the buffet, I really don't know what to think. I didn't get sick so I'm not going to complain about not being able to give zero stars.  Aria, I love you and your amazing rooms but I'm utterly disappointed with this buffet.

Then came Saturday and was super excited to check this buffet out because of how Aria portrayed itself, and the pricing being $35/person(approx?), we were hoping the best of the best. If anyone of you have seen Aria, you know what I'm talking about. You enter into the casino and it's extremely modern, just the way I like it and the atmosphere is like none other casino.   Anywho, back to the The Buffet @ Aria. We were greeted and seated really quickly with no line on a saturday(which was something I found really odd). They offered us each 1/2 a lobster(why not a full?) and I was a bit disappointed in that, but the taste of the lobster was AAA quality! It was really sweet and cooked perfectly(at least mine was)...  THE FOOD: King crab legs and Alaskan king crab legs were a bit too much on the salty side. Taste was really plain and I was a bit disappointed to say that I HAVE HAD BETTER AT THE RIO AT RENO.. RENO? yea, RENO!!! The roast beef was delish and as well as garlic steamed clams+mussels. I believe these are the only things that were actually good IMO.  The GOOD: Free Chardonnay/Merlot Wine (unlimited refills) on the weekends!  The BAD: 1/2 a lobster? SERIOUSLY? Only good thing mentioned has been mentioned..  OVERALL: Not the crappiest buffet I ever been to, but definitely not the best. Better than average so I give it a 3.75 stars!  WOULD I COME BACK? NOPE. I'm sure I like MGM's buffet better... SAD, I know.",

This buffet has a great selection of different cuisine (American, Asian, Mexican, Greek). The service is exceptional and the extra $7 is well worth the \"all you can drink champagne and mimosas\"  because they really do mean \"all you can drink\" Ive stayed for hours and they just keep pouring as long as you are in the hours of the brunch buffet. If you love crab legs this place is what you have been waiting for. They are all cracked and ready to be eaten, their selection is random but well thought out and their desserts are fabulous. Definitely a good way to get your day started :)",

My highlights worth noting: - An omelette station where you add whatever your heart desired however as most buffet omelette chefs fresh out of culinary school, my eggs were overdone. -Oh, the carving station, surprising the turkey breast was juicy and moist that caught me off guard, but the beef top round was tough and dry like shoe leather. -Sushi - no raw stuff wtf...for 30 just sushi rolls...again wtf. -Snow crab legs - pretty good once you squeeze a little acid and dip it in warm butter, it's so money that I had a second helping and opted out of dessert.  My overall opinion, it's just blah!",

What really blew me away was the quality of the desserts.  I'm usually not impressed with the desserts at buffets because they typically have no flavor.  These were the best desserts I've had at a buffet.  I also read that the desserts were supplied by Jean Philippe, same guy who has the patisserie in the Aria lobby area.  So that's probably why they were so good.  Great selection of seafood. Lobster was nice too, including selection of lobster ravioli and lobster sandwiches on Sunday night.  We will return.",

I only got ONE (not fully loaded) plate and THAT WAS IT for the night.  I had to fill my stomach with their chicken noodle soup since there was nothing worth eating.  The quality and presentation of the food was way below average.  I would put them in the Circus Circus category yet I paid almost $40 per person?!?!?!  And the person who served/cut the salmon kept screaming at me asking me to get the salmon and when I said, \"no thanks\", he kept asking why not? and kept selling how WONDERFUL the salmon was.. well.. if it was that good, then why did it looked SO DRIED and no one was in line for it.  It made the whole experience cheap.  Like he was a street vendor trying to sell me food.. omg..  They had a 1/2 lobster per person but the meat on the lobster was really tough to eat.  It was totally overcooked.  And the unlimited wine... sorry, but I was there for the FOOD~  what good does the wine do if the food sucks.",

    "text": "This buffet was an incredible ripoff. The prices are the norm for a Las Vegas buffet but the food was reminiscent of something you'd find in Hometown. I found that the problem was they tried to cover too much ground. There was mexican, asian, seafood, pizza, etc but only a small tiny section of each.   Mexican: I think I saw 4 things in their section. Enchiladas and Mexican rice were what I remembered.   Asian: Decently sized but incredibly random. They had a platter of kimchi with chilled tofu/cucumber salad on one side and purposely cold chicken noodles on the other.  A few steps down from the asian section were cut up chunks of cheese and deli meat placed on a carving board.   Pizza: I never bother with buffet pizza but my boyfriend said it was really bad.   Seafood: Cocktail Shrimp and Crab Legs period.   Dessert: I picked up a cookie labeled chocolate chip only to find that it had nuts in it. Disappointed look for me but imagine if someone with a nut allergy had picked that one up. But even besides that, the cookies were pretty gross. I'd have to say i've tasted better from the bakeries at Ralph's or Safeway. Those actually semi-taste home-made but these tasted like they came from cardboard or out of a factory.",

Price/food combo is pretty good!  top choices: -King Crab Legs -Chicken Curry with fresh Garlic Naan -Dessert Bar: french macaroons, Creme Brulee, etc just to name a few.   *tip - some of the crab legs were salty, so instead of getting all bloated from eating just a handfull of salty king crab legs dunk the meat in some water to get some of the salt off and suddenly the meat becomes incredibly sweet - NOM NOM NOM !  If you're a fan of lobster the buffet does come with an order of maine lobster (1 order per 2 people) also you're dinner comes with house wine (white or red) though my friends that got the wine said it was pretty rank :(  All the other food wasn't bad just not memorable. However, there's no long wait for dinner which is a plus! My only gripe was that at dinner we could not find our waitress to take our drink order. And our cups went empty w/o her returning to check on us a few times.",

    "text": "2.5 stars?  NO WAY!!!  Last week, on a random trip to Vegas, the BF and I stopped by Aria to check it out.  After scoping out the interior and playing at the tables/slots for a bit (they have the COOLEST slot machines!), we decided that we should probably eat.  Neither of us were very hungry, so we didn't want to check out a steakhouse or anything... In fact, we didn't even want to check out a buffet.  So why we ended up at The Buffet, I've no idea.  What matters is, we did.  At 9:30pm on a Monday night, the place was pretty dead.  Apparently, last seating is at 10pm, so we weren't surprised by the near-empty restaurant.  But whatever.  We weren't in the mood for anything special anyway.  The cashier at the front was lame.  She wasn't rude, but she was totally disinterested.  Then again, 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night, her blah attitude was understandable.  But the hostess and the servers?  Super nice and friendly!  All throughout the meal, they were very attentive, refilling our every glass, even going so far as to bring me a box of tissues (I couldn't stop sneezing for some reason).  The servers behind the buffet were just as friendly, taking care to explain all the various dishes they had out and making their recommendations.  Again, 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night, we didn't expect excellent food choices.  To be fair, the food choices were mediocre.  There was an Asian section (most of it was just whatevers), an Indian section (I didn't try it, but the BF thought it was pretty stellar), an Italian section (I didn't bother), a full-service pasta station, a seafood station (I didn't go near here, but I assume they had crab, bc I saw people eating crab legs), a meat carving station, a kebab station, yadda yadda.  Admittedly, the \"choices\" were plentiful.  However, not everything was available.  For example, they were out of kebabs for the night.  Completely understandable.  I got myself a giant hunk of prime rib.  I debated on the turkey and the lamb, but thought better of it and stuff to my beef.  They had everything to go with it (mint jelly, horseradish, blah blah blah), and all the yummy sides.  The salad bar was pretty decent, too.  Here's the thing.  It's a typical buffet.  BUT!!!  The QUALITY is amazing!  Everything was SO FRESH!!!  Again, I have to note that it was 30 minutes before closing on a Monday night.  How fresh could the food be?  I was sure it had been lying around all night, and the \"cooks\" probably didn't even bother to put their hearts and souls into the food.  However, everything was crisp, cold, hot, fresh, etc.  I don't normally like buffets because the food tastes old, but The Buffet had food that practically tasted made-to-order!  As if that wasn't satisfying enough...  THE DESSERT.  I only recently became a fan of desserts.  Even with my newfound appreciation for the sweet concoctions, however, I can't exactly say that I love to gorge on desserts after every meal.  I'm more of a \"few bites\" type of gal.  Well... The Buffet's dessert selection was SO AMAZING.  Everything was plated so beautifully on modern frosted glass plates, each bit of dessert complimented by some sort of accent \"side.\"  After a second of browsing, the BF and I decided... We had to try EVERYTHING.  Yep.  Key lime pie with a homemade marshmallow stick - I don't even LIKE key lime pie, but this was great!  Not too tart, not too sweet... and the marshmallow stick was AWESOME!  Strawberry Shortcake - Hands down MY FAVORITE.  The marscapone cream was so light and perfect, and the cake itself was FANTASMO!  Nutella Cake - I expected this one to be weird, but it was a great mix of hazelnut chocolate and coffee.  Holy cow.  I think this one had some sort of orange marmalade looking thing on the side.  Bananas Foster - This was the only thing I was MEH about.  I thought it was good, but much too sweet.  Creme Brulee - I've NEVER had a creme brulee at a buffet and thought it tasty.  This was PERFECT!  The consistency wasn't all super-curdled.  It was light and not too yolk-y.  I don't remember what this was paired with.  Cream Puffs - Cream puffs at buffets are usually gross.  THESE WERE NOT.  Little puffs of HEAVEN, dude!  There were a bunch of other desserts, like rice crispies (totally good!), cookies (a great variety), bread pudding (steaming!), and whatnot.  Each plated dessert came with some sort of pairing.  I can't remember which dessert it was, but there was one with some pineapple marmalade sort of thing, and that was GOOOOOOOOOOOOD.  They also have a gelato bar.  Anyway.  Seriously.  Five stars just for the dessert alone.  FAN TAS TIC!  I swear, I'm going back again and again and again and again.",

I thought the food was pretty good and all very fresh.  If you're a huge dessert fan, they have a great selection of very tasty desserts including a beautiful array of cookies.  I mostly stuck with the crab legs.  Worth checking out and the price is rather reasonable.",

    "text": "You would think being one of the newest resorts in Las Vegas, and smack in the middle of all the action, that The Buffet at Aria would be top notch.  Any but!  I went with a group of 4 on a Wednesday at 12 noon.  There was a 30 minute wait.  No big deal for a quality buffet.  Once we got our table, the service was prompt and good.  This is why I gave it at least 2 stars.  If the service was poor, I would have given none (1).  So why the poor rating? THE FOOD!  They pride themselves on all you can eat crab legs.  And they had both hot and cold to select from.  I tried both.  Both were very dry and little on the meat.  The legs are cut length wise down the middle, so you get one really thin side of meat to eat, which takes a lot of work to get a small dry and flaky reward.  They have several stations to sample different parts of styles; Asian, Mediterranean, American, Mexican and a couple others.  The Asian sucked.  Noodles were bland and the Korean ribs fat and greasy.  The Prime rib (which was actually Ribeye roast, not Prime) was dark throughout.  There is a cold cut section which was tasty, but all the cheeses next to it were cubed.  So if you wanted to make a little sandwich, you were out of luck.  I tried a pepperoni pizza bagel and waited until a fresh one came out of the oven.  When I got back to my table to eat, it was soggy in the middle, disgusting.  I tried a few other things and overall wasn't impressed.  The dessert section had a lot of variety and I sampled several items.  All were pretty good, except for a lollipop cake.  It was gross.  All four of us had high hopes for this buffet.  The Aria hotel is super nice and has an upscale look inside and out.  So to pay $35 and for this meal was a huge let down.  I'm not trying to be overly critical, just accurate.  Trying the one at Caesar's next... I hear it is amazing.  Hopefully I will remember to post a review",

We stayed at Aria for opening night and received dining credit... since we were walking by the buffet a few minutes before they switched to dinner prices, we made a quick decision to eat here.  Big mistake!   The buffet stations had more plates and bread than actual food items to choose from!  It looks like an (upscale) high school cafeteria!  After taking a plate and walking from one end to the other and back, I still didn't have anything on my plate!  I finally decided to try the mashed potatoes and turkey since nothing else looked that great.  We thought maybe we were on the overlap of lunch and dinner so decided to wait an extra hour before leaving to see if they put anything else out!  The only thing that changed was the chicken curry to shrimp curry! Bottom line... I wouldn't go back. Even with a free dining credit it wasn't worth it!  Note: Most of the uploaded pictures are of desserts... probably because it's the only part of the buffet they actually put an effort into with variety and presentation.",

The food was replenished pretty quick when items were running low, but some of the items lacked flavor. While it was a good meal I wouldn't necessarily make a point of returning to this buffet out of all the other delicious ones in Vegas.",

    "text": "BF and I came here with his parents on Thursday (after Christmas) night. It was holiday pricing, so $46.99 per person. We decided to try this buffet because we each redeemed 2 comps from myVEGAS, otherwise we would not have paid to go. We waited about 45 minutes to be seated.   The selection was small compared to other buffets. BF and I mainly ate the prime rib (decent), tenderloin (dry), and king crab legs (decent). There was a gelato wheel among a variety of desserts. The pistachio gelato and flan were good!  The buffet was spacious, but due to the small selection and the price, we will probably not come back.",

In both cases we were prepared for a long line but we only waited no longer than 10 minutes to pay and be seated. The cost was $35 and well worth it. They had a great selection to choose from. Everything looked great and tasted fresh. I really enjoyed the crab legs, clams in garlic butter sauce, pancakes, turkey (which was very moist), kielbasa, fried plantain, coffee gelato, panna cotta, and carrot cake. The thing we liked most was that the seating area was open and had natural light from the windows facing the pool area. The staff was also very courteous and friendly. Previous to eating here our favorite buffet was at Paris but this has now become our top choice.",

There were planty of empty tables but not enough personnel to seat you. 3rd surprise, food was ok, but not good enough for the cost. The crab legs were half frozen. Not sure if i had crab legs or crab leg ice. In conclusion, will not come back again.",

    "text": "John, I am right with you on this one.   First off the Pros:  Bottomless wine, lobster(although limited to half a lobster/ person), clean, wait service was real good, and the desserts.   Cons:  Food was par at best, bland and greasy, a bit pricy for the food that was served.   Straight forward, the food was ok.. nothing special although they had crab legs, lamb, and prime rib. There were both pretty dry and I'm not usually the biggest fan of au jus. I had a plate and a half of random foods and nothing that especially peaked my interest including their crab legs. So I decided to go straight to dessert, I mean truthfully no one can screw up anything with sugar in it right? Because of my huge sweet tooth, the desserts definitely hit the spot after a standard meal.   The banana foster was yummy, some chocolate cake was also really good, I also got some of the ice cream or gelato (don't seem to remember), and a number of their cookies. If what you need is dessert, than this place will indeed suffice.   I would rather make the drive to M resort where prices are cheap and food is better than Aria and the desserts are also bomb!  Or the Wynn/Bellagio buffet. Spring the extra cash wouldn't be much in this case as we paid about 35 a pop at Aria.",

Seafood: King crab legs were a bit salty depending if you got them at the bottom of the bowl or at the top. I loved the way they had them prepared. They are split in half so you don't have to be picking at it. Makes it efficient. The quality of crab legs are pretty good. Yes, they may be slightly on the frozen side, but it also means you wont go home with a sick stomach.  Meats: Yum! Lamb galore and the prime rib was juicy too. There is also chicken enchiladas... the sauce is yummy, but then again, I like it mild.  I saved my stomach for dessert. I tried almost everything in the dessert isle (except for their mint cake)... the colour was a bit scary. It was well worth it. I hear their desserts are catered by Jean Philipe... don't quote me on it. They are so tasty... I particularly liked the cream puff... it has custard and fresh cream (not the cheap stuff) sandwiched in the centre. I went back for more...",

They dont put out large portions. So its being constantly changed. Although I only had 3 crab legs the chef didn't give me the eye when I asked could he steam them please LOL  It wasnt a lot of variety, but enough of everything. Ur not over or underwhelmed by the selections. My friend thought the dessert plates were the coolest thing ever. And the desserts themselves were really good. And u can tell they put a lot of tlc into these mini desserts they were all good.   They weren't that good about refilling drinks or removing used plates, but everything I ate was good.

It was way easier to decide on what to eat since there was less to chose from!  We got seated by the window overlooking the pool so the view was great!  I like the open and bright design of the buffet!!  The only thing bad thing is that we had to walk pretty far to get our food.  When you are carrying a full plate and a bowl of soup, its not so fun to walk back!!  I was walking kinda slow and kept looking down at my plate, hoping that the soup wasn't going to spill over.  I felt like i was a contestant on a game show...you know.. bring as much food back as fast as you can without dropping anything... lol    They have naan, which i didn't get to try because its only served for dinner.  Hopefully next time.   Their lunch is a great value at only $24 on Saturday.  If you go elsewhere, you are looking to spend around the same price if not more on quality food.  Why not eat at Aria for all you can eat!?   PS. Their mango gelato is amazing!!",

Every dish I tried was solid, and the dessert selection and presentation was incredible. Best Creme Brulee I've ever had. The space is nice too, really light, airy, and clean-feeling (as opposed to the somewhat dank, farm-like environment one typically experiences in a buffet). Anyway, highly recommend! :)",

Serving King Crab and Roast Beef (usually reserved for a dinner buffet) isn't what makes it special.  They have (or had then) one of the top 10 Chocolatiers in the world.    Usually at a buffet the dessert island looks like it was set up through a production line process.  Not this place.  EVERYTHING looked awesome, and (what I tried) tasted even better than it looked.  My wife had a chocolate shooter and exclaimed \"this is so good that they should require a prescription for it.\"  We had to limit ourselves because something that damn tasty cannot be good for you.  I am not normally a dessert person but it was phenomenal.    Due to the fact that too much sugar is not healthy. I usually (if ever) do not eat dessert, and if I do it wouldn't be more than 1 dessert servings at any one meal. It was so good I had 2 & 1/2 servings (I had to taste to see if it was as delicious as it looked [and it was]).  It has been nearly a year since I was there, but I am looking forward to my next visit at the end of May so that I can once again enjoy my self imposed dessert limit (2 next time).  It's a good thing that I don't live in Vegas or I'd be needing to go on a diet in no time.",

The food was sub par and the variety was limited. The best thing on the menu were crap legs and sushi, and that is not saying much. There was also a beef section with prime rib and beef fajitas, an Indian section, a pizza section and a Chinese food section. I use the word section very lightly because these sections had maybe 3-4 different items tops. But the taste and quality was crap! The sushi was rubbery (and the tuna was black, something I have never seen). I went with 4 other people and everybody felt like they just got ripped off. Even I will generally stuff myself at a buffet to get the proper value, but I wasn't interested.   It might be worth mentioning that one of the people I went with got the squirts later on that night, but it may be hard to pin that on the restaurant. But the image that it provides is the right one.  I would recommend going to the buffet at the M resort. It has better quality, more items and is a few bucks cheaper.  Overall AVOID this place like it's a roach stand in Mexico City!!

I would never give up pizza on my own.) The line was long (a good sign, right!) and the tables were full, so we paid and waited. While waiting, we realized that despite the fact we had NOT ordered their endless drinks, they had added a gratuity to our bill. There were only two of us, and all we wanted was sodas (which we thought would be self-serve.)  No, they have servers to bring you drinks. Why? It's a buffet. Seriously, I can carry my own drink over to my table. I understand if you had ordered alcohol, but they should have a section for people that order the drink-add on option. This appears to be an excuse to add gratuity to every bill despite making it appear like something you can choose to do.  The food was okay -- I particularly liked the steamed crab legs, but the pizza was sort of ... zinc-y. I don't know how to describe that better -- it had a weird metal taste. all in all, the Monte Carlo was a better choice for us. The asian dishes at the Monte Carlo were better too.",

    "text": "Since I spent my last trip in Vegas staying at the Aria, I figured I might as well check out their buffet for dinner one night.  Overall, there is not much to say- it was a good buffet, but for Vegas it seemed pretty standard and was nothing special (note: I did go on a Monday night and have heard that weekends might be better).  For the most part, the food I had was good.  I spent most of my time downing roast beef, shrimp, and snow crab legs.  I also tried a variety of pastas, pizzas and other dishes.  But again, although all of it was good and tasty, none of it was special enough to say it was really amazing.    On the service side of things, the wait staff was a little slow at first, but as the meal went on it seemed to pick up a bit, so I'm not sure there's really anything to complain about.  In essence, the Aria buffet was simply unremarkable.  I don't really have anything bad to say, but I don't really have anything good to say either.  In Vegas, I would expect better.",

This may sound like a lot of dishes but really there's only two or three dishes per style. They do prepare the dishes well but there's just not enough choices. Their desserts however offers more choices than the cooked foods combined.",

We literally fasted from breakfast so we could have an early dinner at the Buffet - Husband and I both ended up with the worst (*crab smelling*) upset stomach ever.  The crab/shrimp were previously frozen, very watery, bland and - BAD. The only thing the husband and I both ate (and a small quantity) and both are 100% certain we got sick from. We eat a LOT of seafood and know some serious quality when we find it.  I'm not saying that the seafood at this buffet is always bad - but this was enough the first time so we wont be back and advise others to think twice before eating here.  Cant remember anything else about this buffet apart from the fact we got the sh*ts!",

Things were fresh, and there were people there to serve you up with whatever it was that you needed.  Their red and white wine selections that came with the meal were simple, and once again, nothing jumped out at me.  The only thing I enjoyed was the lamb...  The only thing I do remember jumping out at me were the little cups filled with an oreo chocolate cream/mousse kind of thing.  I'd prepare a tub full of it and consume face-first if I could...  We should have went to the Bellagio's buffet...  =(",

The meat (which I judge really hard on, considering my background) was tender, VERY TENDER. It was easy to cut, and easy to choose. I had NO complaining.  They make the kind of pasta you want. The drinks (soda, raspberry tea, etc) are for FREE (well, with your meal, but free refills!. I know it sounds silly but there ARE places where they don't give you that option)  They had king crab, asian food, salad, etc etc. I thought they made the asian food non-salty though, which was a plus for me.   They just have so much to offer! We sat there for 3 hrs and ate so much. I was truly satisfied. Oh, and if you must know, the bathrooms are clean!!!  The staff was extra extra nice. You can do the valet parking at arias and just provide tips.   OH! and a BIG bonus for me was that they actually SCOOP the icecream FOR ME!! :] This ain't some lame icecream either...it tasted homemade. Oh, and their flan was delish. I went back to my hotel, SATISFIED. Now I wish I could go back :[",

The omlet was meh and while the wait staff was fantastic the food servers/cooks were not remotely friendly or helpful. Perhaps because I am not a meat eater I did not find many things to eat to but my dining companion who is a meat eater also found the food to be sub par at best. Perhaps there are better meals throughout the day but a breakfast buffet should at the very least be tasty particularly at the price point.",

Everything was fresh and beautiful.  Yes the crab was great, but so were the clams, salmon (perfectly cooked), tandoori chicken, naan, and the absolutely perfect desserts. There's this macaroon bar thing that I could live on. And the chocolate things on a stick? OMG.  The only thing I didn't finish (I took SMALL portions, and I'm still stuffed) was the pizza. Kind on soggy. I didn't try the deli, Italian, Asian stations. Only salad, seafood, Indian, pizza, and dessert (did I mention the macaroons?!?). If you play myVegas, there's a bogo deal. Oh and spend the extra 12.99 for the bottomless drinks. They have an ample amount of alcohol and worth the money. We had the dinner buffet tonight (Monday) and it was 34.99 per person plus the drinks. Happy eating!",

There were a couple things that were \"meh\", like the WAAAAY over cooked saffron risotto , the tepid fish and chips, and some dried out dim sum. However on all of those the flavor was good, especially the risotto, but they were just sitting out too long. The mushroom polenta was mind blowing, and the dessert were phenomenal...really everything else was amazing. Also by pre-dishing most the stuff you waste less food and get to try more dishes. I will most definitely be going back!",

While I don't think the food is fantastic there are a few things about it that keep me coming back.  The first thing I really appreciate is the fresh fruit on the Salad Bar.  I also love their Crab Legs.  They use King Crab instead of tiny Snow Crab like many other Buffets these days.  I also like the fact that their Crab Legs are served warm with drawn Butter instead of Cold with Cocktail Sauce!  If I am going to a Buffet the main thing I like to eat are Crab Legs and Shrimp.  The Prime Rib was fine but not great.  The other thing I love about the Aria Buffet is the desserts!  I guess Jean Philippe make their desserts and they are fantastic!!!  I love French Macarons!!!  Probably one of my favorite desserts.  They also always have Gelato and other great desserts as well.",

For them to not just \"put it out there\" makes them look stingy.   Bone-in prime rib: They won't serve you the cut near the bone or even the the rib itself until after a certain time, like 6 or 7 pm. What's that about?!  Sashimi: I think they had this, or at least it was on display, but it was hard to figure out how to get it.   Even though you pay the difference for the gourmet dinner, it doesn't seem like they want to provide the gourmet food. But at the same time, you can't exactly say that they didn't either.",

The food looks great, but has no real taste.  I had a $75 food credit at the Aria, so my wife and I used it for this. Not worth it.  If I paid real money, would have given it 1 star.  Oh! Also two plates I picked up in the clean dishes pile had food residue on them. Yech. Had to get an extra napkin because I put my hand in something squishy and yellow under my plate.

You would think a nice hotel like Aria would try to up their game for buffets to compete with every other hotel but no, they just bank on people coming here because it's convenient. While the food wasn't bad---it just wasn't anything special. Nor was it very good. The buffet selection is just okay--but most things that they made were either over/under seasoned, over cooked, sitting out for too long, etc. LOL  That being said though, our waitress was extremely friendly and nice and accommodated our dozens of drink orders and consistently always cleaned up our table. She was a big win for me.",

We had kind of a terrible experience because we were short on time and stupidly chose to eat there despite that, so by the time we paid and were seated, we had 30 minutes before our Cirque du Soleil show. I mean, yeah we're idiots.  However, the quality of food was overall really excellent (and not in a \"for a buffet\" sort of way - it was just really fresh). I sampled food from the Asian section (rivaled Chinese restaurant quality except for the fried rice), almost all of the seafood (wow - so much good seafood, prepared well, and super fresh, unlike other buffets I've eaten at), a little Indian food (the Dal Lentils were as good as my favorite Indian restaurant at home, but the basmati rice and Chicken Curry were only average), and just a bit of the salad bar (I grabbed one wedge salad).  I know, I know, you're wondering how I managed to try so much in so short a period of time, but when I've spent $90 on a meal for my husband and me, I want it to count.  The desserts were really good and plentiful - I tried the key lime pie, which was really good, and stole three macarons (WE HAD TO GO I'M SORRY I'LL NEVER DO IT AGAIN). I ate them the following day, and they were pretty good, albeit a little stale.  My only complaint was the extreme lack of service. Our server came by once, maybe twice right before we left, so we were thirsty most of the 30 mins we were there. Because we were there pretty early, it wasn't particularly busy, so I was quite dismayed that we were basically ignored.  But I'd go back, if for no other reason than to eat there like a normal person who has all the time in the world.",

But we're talking about a good dozen of tables were filled at the time. But that's understandable because that's super early for dinner anyways. I have to say it's not a bad thing cause we haven't had a meal all day so we were hungry and no line up. That's already a bonus.   The food was kinda meh even when I was super hungry. That was surprising to me. I don't know if I had high hopes or something or did it really not stand out for me. What threw me off was the shrimps. It said peeled shrimps. So, of course you expect them to be peeled already and ready to be eaten. That wasn't the case. There were still shells on them and it look like the chef just put a cut down the middle so it would make it easier to peel off the shells. Which I thought was funny. The shrimps were kinda small too. Variety of food was alright. Enough for us to choose from or sample from. The dessert is always my favourite and I love how they have a variety of gelato to choose from.   Service was kinda meh. Our server may have been a bit old and had some hearing problems or something cause we had to repeat ourselves over and over again. Oh and we found a rotten lemon in our drink. Don't think it was the servers fault considering the lemon looked fine on the outside till you looked inside the lemon.   I don't think this buffet would be one I would recommend to others when they are in Vegas considering there are more on the strip to try out. But if you are lazy and you live in this hotel then sure give this place a try. My friends did say their prime ribs were really good. My piece was just slightly chewy for my liking.",

Exceptionally well-presented and prepaid, the mix runs from bean burritos to pizza to prime rib and a sushi selection rivaling any good restaurant.   The desserts are very good and handled by a cut-above of staffers. We spaced and timed our consuming to go back for several plates, shared a few things just to try them and had two hours of careful sampling. The big portions went to carved prime rib and the sushi, but not all at once. Tip big; if you're half-smart, the casino will give it back and for our staffers, well-deserved.  Oh? You didn't look for incentive programs to eat here on a two-for-one or comp? That one's on YOU. Cut the cost to at least half and you've scored bragging rights.   Las Vegas fare runs from damn awful to sublime, so how you eat is on you: bad nutrition is plentiful; cheap chow and sloppy consumers are plentiful outside, so why not dress a bit nicer and enjoy the Aria's Crystal area? Vegas top name places offer wonderful dinners ad lunches that run from $16 hamburgers to $35 chicken. Forgetpizza anywhere but Chicago, that's a given. It's a getaway: get away from eating the same stuff that you went on vacation to escape.  Leave the goddamn kids at HOME; this is Vegas and intended for adults, and the Strip outside willgladly eat stupid tourists without a second thought. Avoid most of the food out there. I recommend the Buffet as an overview of cuisine... all well done.",

For those who have eaten here in the past, Let's me tell you The Buffet at Aria has undergone a huge overhaul of its old buffet and it now looks better and fresher than before to try and compete with Wicked Spoon and most of all The Bacchanal Buffet. From what I read online, they spent nearly 3.5 millions to makeover their old buffet.  Here's a Full Steady HD Tour of the Newly Renovated  \"The Buffet\" at Aria that I recorded over the past weekend. or just go on youtube and type \" Newly Renovated Buffet at Aria.\"  or click on the YouTube link below to watch my video that I recorded of the buffet  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtYpILdqTXyI&s=d10162348c518958623ea16ed0365bf878508893e71e28db282d3bc607e93094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=tYpI...</a>  The video was recorded during the dinner rush.   It costs 40 bucks for dinner.   This is the only buffet I believe to have Alaskan King Crab legs on the Strip. Even Bacchanal Buffet at Caesars Palace doesn't have King Crab Legs. They have a varieties of Sushi rolls to choose from. They even serve jumbo shrimp that I don't see at other buffets on the strip.  They even have a cool rotating Ice Cream Bar.  Overall, I have to say this Newly Renovated Buffet is definitely up to par with Wicked Spoon and Bacchanal Buffet.  Like I said above, If you guys want to see how the newly renovated buffet looks like I have recorded a HD video of the newly makeover Buffet at Aria:  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3DtYpILdqTXyI&s=d10162348c518958623ea16ed0365bf878508893e71e28db282d3bc607e93094\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=tYpI...</a>",

Some of the plates were empty most of the time even though I got up about five times and went and walked around.   I thought the service for the ladies that got us drinks was pretty nice and she was quick about it! But food wise I would say go somewhere else and it is not worth it to eat here!

    "text": "I usually come to The Buffet at Aria when I have a free buffet voucher or the 2 for 1 buffet price. I believe MyVegas still has the free lunch buffet from Mon-Fri (most other places it's til Thursday). Decor is great, place is clean, selection is not bad. They have gelato/ice cream for dessert! So I usually skip the line if any with my Gold Players Card (you can skip most buffet lines with Pearl and up). Because I don't feel like paying full price, I've never come here on a Friday night or a weekend. I've read that they have lobster on the menu then? Not sure. I always start with the prime rib, grab maybe some turkey, and get some soup. Afterwards I go around for my second round and get crab legs with melted butter, take a look at their Latin foods, and Asian foods. In the middle area they usually have something sort of fancy looking, so I get some of that. The Pho noodles and soup isn't great, but if you add sauces you can alter the taste a bit. Dessert selection is not bad, and as I mentioned earlier, you can get gelato or ice cream. I haven't been to every single buffet on the strip, but my order goes something like the following based on taste/price/variety: 1) Rio Seafood buffet (I think they just combined the 2 buffets now, but have 2 different price options, not MGM) Unlimited New Zealand lobster tail at dinner. 2) Wicked Spoon (Cosmo, not MGM) 3) Bellagio 4) Bacchanal (Caesar's Palace, not MGM) 5) Le Village (Paris, not MGM) 6) Aria 7) The Mirage 8) Planet Hollywood (Not MGM) 9) Mandalay Bay 10) Harrah's 11) The Excalibur 12) MGM (From here on down, it's not worth your money to go) 13) Luxor  14) Monte Carlo (The only place I didn't feel full when I left)  I've also been to the buffet at \"M\", but you would need to drive to get there or take a cab/uber. That one is ranked up there with Bellagio. I'm just going to list that in all of my reviews for each buffet.",

From the time we paid at the cashier to the time they opened the rope to let 2 groups in was 25 minutes. We even saw the VIP line being forced to wait and there were a few arguments with the staff asking why is there a wait at a self serve buffet that is basically empty! It makes no sense for an expensive buffet.  Also there are no steamed crab legs at lunch and they'll wait 20 mins into dinner to put out a small bowl which you better time right if you want to get some. The waitresses are hit or miss as they are obviously understaffed. There's a lot better choices in Vegas. Skip the aggravation of the Aria buffet.",

We declined the inexpensive addition of all you drink alcohol with our dinner. We wanna survive and remember this trip!  We were expecting more for how popular the Aria buffet lines are during the weekends, (we came on a Thursday).   The crabs that were warm weren't cut in half, the ones that were cut in half very obviously were just barely thawed.  I was very excited to see they had one of my favorite sushi rolls, which has cream cheese and isn't that common.  The nacho cheese sauce they had gets dry and hard really fast.  Not a good selection of premade salads. I thought I saw a picture of kale salad on Yelp, but I must have been mistaken. That definitely wasn't here.  Their jalapeno sausage was just ok, more of shock taste than actually yummy.  My boyfriend liked the rib eye, though a bit fatty.  They had this cool mini cup with colorful miscellaneous vegetables in a veggie dip. Except.... the veggie dip wasn't really a dip, it was a thin liquid consistency. Yuck.  The pork dumplings and fried rice were alright.  The desserts were ok, but nothing special compared to other buffets. I liked the oreo whoopie pie the most.  Servers were pretty attentive about our waters.  Kind of done with Vegas buffets.",

I'm not very particular especially with buffets, but I was not very impressed for $42 a person.    The sushi was nothing impressive the rice was a little dry the rolls weren't wrapped nicely.  They had spicy tuna roll and I think some sort of Philly roll.  I didn't even want to touch the salmon sashimi they had out.  Not sure if it even was salmon sushi.  Could have been cold smoked salmon.    I thought oh I'm headed to the Prime Rib since you can't go wrong there.  I assumed there would be prime rib.  There was no prime rib.  Not sure what beef I got.  It tasted okay.   The snow crabs were the star of the show.  If it wasn't for the snow crabs I would have been upset.  They were easy to snap open and remove the crab meat, weren't too salty and tasted delish!  King crab was meh.  They split it open for you so it's easy to access but it dried out the meat and it wasn't tasty at all.    I tried three of their mini dishes.  I tried some braised beef over mash and it was super salty.   I then tried their clams and most of the clams were dried out sitting under the heat lamp.  And I tried the salmon.  That one was pretty good.  Not as dry as I thought it would be.   I was so confused about their asian noodles.  They had pho noodles and ramen noodles.  The noodles were without their broth in a small bowl.  There were two broths but one was all the way in the back and looked like it was hard to access.  I thought oh well maybe it isn't pho and there is just one broth for both noodles.  That was not the case.  I accidentally poured pho broth in my ramen noodles.    I had some of their dim sum items.  They were pretty decent but about the quality of any other cheap Chinese buffet anywhere.    Our favorite dessert at our local casino buffets are the creme brulee.  They had it here and we were so excited.  My son got his and said, \"where's the brulee?\".  There was no candied sugar on top.  It still tasted good but come on now!    The best part about this buffet was that kids 5-12 were free.  If it had just been my husband and I eating here I think I might have flipped out.  But since our family of five ate for less than $100.  I was okay with it.    This made me appreciate my local casino buffet so much more!  I might update that review soon.",

Also, all dishes look not good and fresh. Our kids are very hungry. Therefore, we gave it a try. After we sit inside, we feel their waitress must be have a very bad day because they look like you own them million dollars and very mad. Also, some of dishes did not look very fresh. We can spend $25 in local casino buffets and get better service with similar dishes but more fresh. Next time, we rather pay a little more to go Caesars Palace Buffet.

Unfortunately, the food itself just tasted very mediocre. I tried the pasta, the poke bowl, the sushi, the Indian food, the dim sum, desserts, and the meats. Only the meat section was satisfying - the roast beef, the steak, and the jalapeno chicken sausage.   I would say out of all the buffets, this was probably the least tastiest.

    "text": "I came here over Super Bowl 50 weekend eager to try it out because I just had the Bellagio Buffett the day prior.   The dinner experience at The Buffett at Aria left me wanting more. It costs more $ to eat here than it does at the Bellagio, but the Aria offers a smaller collection of food and dessert. I enjoyed the King Crab legs and the Prime Rib here but the sushi, chinese and dessert sections were lackluster. I saw a whole aisle of Chinese dim sum steamers but was disappointed to find that they were all filled with buns and some yucky potstickers, no other dim sum. The sushi rice was also really dry too. There were not a lot of patrons eating at 3pm on Sunday, but the servers were very slow in taking away used plates and refilling drinks.    I like that the buffet space is very spacious and the interior looks beautiful. Unfortunately, I rather go back to the Buffet at Bellagio or Bacchanal Buffet because they offer much more in terms of selection at a comparable cost.   REMEMBER to present your MLIFE card to get Tier Credits for your buffet purchase!",

B/c we were still on east coast time, we arrived at 7:30am and we pretty much had the buffet to ourselves.  The buffet offers an international menu and gigantic spread of food.    They have Chinese, Japanese, Italian, Mexican, and American.    Highlights: -Red velvet pancakes -Carrot cake pancakes cinnamon buns -Eggs benedict -Egg Tacos -Corn bread -Southern biscuits -Corn beef hash -Dim sum - pork buns, sticky rice wrapped in leaf, dumplings -Fried rice with eggs and chinese sausage  -Thai ice tea -Chilled seafood - crab legs, shrimp, crawfish - huge selection of desserts including mochi and gelato  I don't do buffets typically, but was amazed by the assortment and diversity of food and good quality.  If you stay in the Aria, the Brunch buffet is worth it.",

    "text": "I have nothing good to say about this buffet experience.  First of all they have 3 lines: general public, M Life rewards, and one for people whole get in line on their room tablet. We stood in line in Mlife rewards line bc we are members. I did not have my card with me, we waited 30 min in that line only to be told we had to have the card and that they couldn't just input my number. GET YOUR CARD. so then we got out of line and used our tablet so we could get in tablet line. Tablet said \"no wait\" and we just saw there were no people in the line earlier. We get down to tablet line and there's at least 5 people in the line now and it's moving just as slow as others. I tell hostess about what tablet said and she said \"sorry\" There were tons of EMPTY dirty tables with nobody cleaning them off. The buffet itself was mediocre unless you're a huge seafood eaters, and even then it wasn't that great. Wasn't not worth the $$$$ that you pay to eat at this hotel. Aria need stop get more hostess help and staff help to move the lines and help people know what to do/which lines to go and what you need. And to be such an automated hotel and not be able to input the card # without the card is ridiculous.  Skip this buffet.",

    "text": "I've only eaten at a handful of buffets in Vegas, but the Buffet at Aria is my absolute favorite. The team at Aria excels here at creating a buffet full of international flavors. The food is nicely varied, well-made, and totally worth the price.   From sushi and Asian dishes, to Mexican favorites and seafood, you really can sample food offerings from across the globe. Your typical American faire is here too, with sandwiches, cheeseburgers, etc. But why eat that when you can have crab legs?! They have a plentiful fruit selection, and a great dessert area complete with ice cream by the scoop.   I left this buffet feeling completely satisfied, and would come back in a heartbeat. I would point out that the line can be a drag, especially when you can see large sections of tables available. We got in line and were maybe 40 people back, and it seemed to take about 30 minutes. So come early, and be patient :)  I'm also a fan of the simple decor here, and the layout. Its multilevel, which is more interesting and deflects the sound better than one big room with table after table. There are also huge windows nearby that look to the pool, which gives the buffet welcome ambient light.   Pace yourself, and don't just choose the first thing you see, there's so much here to love!",

The first time we went was on Christmas Eve and we only waited about 10 minutes in line, but the next time we waited about 20 minutes, which wasn't bad at all. Since my last visit at Easter, they have upgraded a lot of their food selections including a made to order omelet station, red velvet crepe station, and a seafood station with oysters Rockefeller and seafood boil. Other highlights for me were the goat cheese and mushroom pizza, the tonkatsu ramen, fried chicken and waffles, and menudo (my boyfriend said it was really good!). We ate at several buffets during this trip and Aria had one of the best prime ribs we tasted! I was disappointed that they didn't have mochi like during Easter, but they did have some great apple cider sorbet and delicious Black Forest cake. I'm also happy to share that during both of our visits we had great service and all of the servers seemed to work together to clear our plates, refill drinks and make sure we had everything we needed during our meal. If you're a Vegas buffet fan, make sure that Aria is on your list!",

We were seated quickly, but unfortunately right below an air conditioning vent which froze me and cooled the food. .   Our server Kyle brought drinks while we got food. He kept our dirty plates cleared and our glasses full. He had many tables to care for.   Lots of fresh salad items--pears, goat cheese, roasted pumpkin, beets, wheat berries, melons, several dressings, etc.   My favorite entree was the pot roast with mashed potatoes and carrots; it was cooked perfectly with lots of flavor. The masala and chicken curry with basmati rice were also delicious with naan bread, hummus and cucumber sauce (I can't spell the correct name).   Creamed corn was a good side.   My husband loved the tomato bisque soup, prime rib, crab legs and steamed clams with melted butter, Brussels sprouts, rotisserie chicken and sushi.   The chicken taquitos and cheese lasagna were bland.   They had a nice selections of desserts, including gluten free and sugar free pies, cakes, gelato, cookies, flan, pudding, cannoli, etc.   We probably won't eat here again as the M resort south of the strip has a better, less expensive buffet.",

Needless to say, the buffet is always the best time in Vegas, so we tried Aria. We absolutely loved their selection as well as their BOGO endless drink special they had that night! Both my dad and I were able to enjoy some yummy drinks while we gorged on the food that the buffet had to offer. I personally enjoyed their poke station and the gelato! Everything was great, however they did not have fried shrimp which disappointed my parents. When my mother asked about the fried shrimp the head chef came out and said they don't make that, however they instead made her a custom shrimp and butter noodle dish. It was delicious and she was happy that they went above and beyond for something as small as shrimp. It's the little things that they did to make us comfortable which will keep us coming back. Thanks Aria! :)",

First, if you're not the  member you have wait over 1h, that is fine with me when all the tables are occupied, but almost have the tables were empty, nobody was cleaning them. Second, there is time limit 2h, and we saw a waitress  who was pushing some couple to move due to 2h limit. I've never seen something like that in other buffets. Again, almost half the tables around us were empty. Third, we have to wait around 20min so the waitress brings us the drinks. Fourth, we saw some lady who dropped  the spoon on the floor and I believe she put it back to the food section. Fifth, the food was average. The only positive thing is that during dinner time kids eat free.",

I was with a Carlos Sr who believes in second chances so we went to the Aria again, mostly thanks to Myvegas video game comps hahahhaha. Man oh Man was I happy to check this place out.  Everything was delicious.  And after the Bellagio disaster I was sooooo happy to eat a quality meal. Chinese food was on point, ate 2 plates of it.  Vietnamese soup was amazing had 2 bowls.  BBQ was really good.  Brisket was great.  The chef even cooked me 3 plain oysters because I ain't the biggest fan of Oysters Rockefeller.   Crab legs were very good for being cooked (I like chilled on ice better).  The deserts were great.  Hand scooped Ice cream.  Very nice touch.  Bellagio is soft serve ice cream, yuck. Aria great job, I will be back.  And Myvegas game players.  Save your comps you would spend on Bellagio and spend them at Aria instead.  P.S kids are FREE for dinner.   Thank you Aria.",

The fee was $22.99  for two hours of unlimited food. If you wanted unlimited mimosas, bloody marys, and champagne for extra $16.99 extra, though.   Honestly, it was worth every penny.  I think you need to go on an empty stomach in order to enjoy everything lol.  It's so amazing how they have multiple sections for different foods all over the world. Some of the sections are Mediterranean, Asian, Latin and Italian. They also have seafood, desserts....honestly, anything you can think of they had it.   The craziest thing I saw that made me label them the king of buffets was that they had two specific items one was corn- Mexican style with mayo and cheese. I honestly never seen a buffet have something so specific and authentic. Another was red velvet pancakes- with nutella.   What I also like about the buffet that it is very spacious and you never had to wait to get anything!   Our server was also very sweet and attentive.   I would never think of going to any other buffet in Las Vegas besides this one.",

Similar to what other Yelpers say, the highlight of the place is their King Crab legs. If you're a super seafood fan, then you'll definitely have a food coma out of this place. But other than that, they do have various selections of different cuisines (Meats, Asian, Mediterranean, American, Italian, etc). They're all pretty good.  As for drinks, I really liked the watermelon lime juice and Thai tea (they're dispensed near the meat area). Both tasted really yummy and the watermelon juice was super refreshing.

The prime rib was much better. Note some of you may not like the rare cut of beef. The dry rub ribs were great. I didn't try pork, chicken, sausage as Ibwas indulging in seafood.  Pho broth very sweet. Should be simpler and allows consumer to add hosin. Also basil wasn't available and had to ask for it.  Positive  Seafood was awsome. Shrimp were not the small tasteless peel your own variety. They were cleaned and more like U20. The cold Mussles , clams, and snow crab legs were very good. The hot varied was even better. Never tasted misled like this before. It was great. Also on the plus I only came across 1 clam with a broken shell and another barely opened. RRMEMBER don't eat those, especially ones which haven't opened. This is a sign the mollusk was bad.  They have Indian food and fresh naan. The shrimp and grits was fantastic. I would have preferred halibut over salmon in the fish tacos but they were good as well. I can imagine how good it could have been with Copper River Salmon.  Bottomless drinks were good and plentiful I recommend the Rum Punch.  The selection of desserts was excellent.  Desserts were more plentiful with greater variety and quality than Rio of years ago.   All in all a very good buffet. The one I hold in highest is at the M. I'll get a review of that out shortly.",

    "text": "Ahhhhhh the famous Las Vegas buffet.....yeah doesn't exist here for me! I have had umpteen and I mean umpteen Las Vegas buffets at probably every hotel on the strip and the one at the Aria is truly forgettable.   My first grouse....the long line...we waited for close to 45 minutes to get into the buffet and when we got inside....there were empty tables everywhere!! The ladies that were checking people in and collecting the money were painfully slow and were too busy talking on their cell phones. Plus inside the area is pretty disappointing...come on Aria spruce it up!!  My second grouse....food labeling....it is terrible! They have food sections and in a particular food section there will be a plaque telling you all the dishes that are available there. The problem is sometimes I don't know what dish is what....how about putting the label in front of the particular dish!!! Ain't that a brilliant idea!! Example....I picked up a type of salad thinking it was a potato salad....nope turned out it was tuna salad....now if they had just put the label in front of each dish...would have made my life much easier!   Also I am not vegetarian but I noticed that the labeling made it very hard to tell, which dish was vegetarian or not. Example, it says vegetable fried rice....but its full of pork and beef...fabulous Aria!! You just ruined some poor vegetarian's day!!  My third grouse....food taste...overall not impressed. Yes I know its a buffet and I should not expect Michelin star rated food and to be honest I am not. But I do expect there to be flavor in the dishes and for them to taste different! I tried almost everything they had there and the best thing was the \"vegetable fried rice\" and the Parmesan bread....all of which I don't need to pay $25 bucks for!  My last grouse....variety....Las Vegas buffets are famous for their lavish spreads and variety in food. I felt a distinct lack of \"lavishness\" here. If you are going to do less than you had better make sure that the quality of the food is high. Unfortunately, Aria fails in both the variety and the taste department!  The servers were nice and the dessert bar was decent...but that's about it. So if you're looking for a Vegas buffet, don't come here, save your time, money and energy and walk yourself over to the Bellagio or Wynn yes it costs more but at least you leave feeling full, satisfied and happy!",

I also visited several buffets while on a recent trip, so... I'll give you my worthless feedback.  I tried the lunch buffet at Caesars, Cosmo, Aria, and M Resort.  This was, by far, the worst buffet I've ever visited.  Every dish was overcooked.  The steak was impossible to cut.  Bland flavors.  They did have Indian food... which was ok, but man... I couldn't get out of here fast enough.  Even the desserts were crappy... which is usually pretty hard to mess up.  If you're staying at Aria and they offer you a free pass... skip it.  Would I go back?  They couldn't pay me to eat here. Ok, they could... but still.",

    "text": "My husband and I are staying in Las Vegas for the week at NY NY and we were so excited to come here, as we usually frequent this buffet every time we visit and are never disappointed. However, today caused me to never come back here again. We arrived around 4:30p today and we're promptly seated by our friendly host. Our waiter was friendly and very quick with our drink order. I come here strictly for the cold crab legs and the carrot cake. The carrot cake here is to die for and it comes with a small serving of a pineapple puree that is just divine. I walk by the dessert bar to get a view of the lovely carrot cakes and what do you know? It's been replaced by a disgusting Black Forest cake. I say it's disgusting because I tried it and it has some type of cherry jam in it that is reminiscent of cough syrup. YUCK! Ok, I'll move on to the crab legs and I'll feel better. Welp, no cold crab legs, just shrimp and muscles. I'm just striking out left and right at this place. I walk around the seafood bar and find steamed crab legs. I guess this will do, they look good. I sit down with my husband and begin cracking open and eating the crab legs and OMG! it's like someone just dumped salt all over them. They're completely inedible! We wasted money on this buffet and there is nothing I want to eat. It's so disappointing. I try the beef steamship and it's cold and hard. I give the beef brisket on mashed potatoes a try and it tastes the way cat food smells! C'mon, Aria! What happened? You used to be so good! You won't be getting my money anymore, or any recommendations.",

We went on a Friday night with my boyfriend, and I think it was about $42 per person. This includes bottomless wine, and a complimentary lobster tail for two.   The food was amazinig! Everything was fresh and the meats,fish, pasta, chicken, and some other entrees were cooked to order. The sushi selection was amazing, and the grilled salmon was like butter in my mouth! Ahhhhh I wish I there was something comparable in Los Angeles!  Filet mignon, New York steak, roasted lamb, and grilled chicken....oh my....my mouth waters at the recollection. Dessert selection is truly endless! They carry the tasiest cakes, pies, chocolate mousse, and ice cream any sweet-toothed person can enjoy.   By the end of the night, I was tipsy, full, and happy. I cannot wait to go back!  If you are in Las Vegas, you MUST do The Buffet at Aria. No questions asked!",

    "text": "There are buffets in Las Vegas much better than this...I'll start by advising you to go somewhere else.  There are \"international\" stations to choose from for different dining options. I tried their pepperoni and veggie pizzas, which were very bland. I also wanted to try the Middle Eastern/Mediterranean food, as I am Chaldean, but was sadly disappointed. The hummus was too \"rough\" and the tabbouleh was more brown than green. I tried a curry chicken dish which was pretty good, but ran out quickly and was never put out again in the time I was there. I had the same experience with the mac and cheese...which was delicious. It's the best thing I had there. They have a lot of desserts to choose from. I tried the mini mint cupcake and a mini gummy bear strawberry cupcake, not only are they cute, they were good too. My husband tried the cinnamon bread pudding and loved it, he said its the best thing he had there.   The flow pattern was odd, which made it confusing for everyone walking around. There was no order, just people aimlessly walking up to stations and in your way the entire time. Granted, I understand it's Vegas and it's busy, but other buffets I've been to had a decent flow of the restaurant allowing people to take want they wanted, walk past what they didn't, and keep the line moving. People had no direction and were all over the place.    There is a long line at all times, but the wait isn't worth what you're getting. Our \"waitress\" Danielle brought us water and coke then disappeared for about 20 minutes. We watched her serve and attend tables that came after us, but even after being flagged several times, she wouldn't come to us. My husband asked another server named Samantha to start taking care of us and our experience got a little bit better after that. Overall, I wouldn't recommend it.",

For this amount of money the food should be hot by the time one returns to their table but it's between barely warm and room temperature.

I tried pretty much all cuisines at their lunch buffet. EVERY SINGLE ITEM IS TERRIBLE!! including desserts (except those cake lollipops). I like the concept where you pre pay for your buffet and drinks (we can include unlimited drinks for extra charge). For table of 6, 4 of us bought unlimited (other two were already hungover from last night). They checked our ids again at the table (I get that since two of us didn't buy they want to make sure they are not minors). They take ENOUGH time to come to the table and take drinks order (I think we had 4 almost non-alcoholic drinks (more mixers and sugar and very less alcohol) each out of 2hrs). The 1st waitress shift was over after an hour and the 2nd waitress came and checked our ids again (I get that too) and she said \"the previous waitress told me, only 3 of you on your table bought unlimited and she is checking how much time we'd left to get drinks\". I told her \"please go to the buffet frond desk, check how many of us bought and add the 20 min time you are wasting to our table for drinks\". She was like \"oh no, I trust you\"!!  Service is Awful, food is awful, drinks are awful Period!!",

The carving station offered a brisket that could have only been prepared by a rookie since it had no smoke ring and was as tough as a rubber sole.

I went to the cashier and told her I'm only paying for myself. She charged me for 3 ppl. Ok accidents happen I worked retail I know the game. She had trouble cancelling it. Had me waiting 20 minutes while she tried to cancel it. Finally called a manager to come fix it. She had no idea how to fix it either.   While I was eating she came up and said she had to call the supervisor who was off site cuz he/she the only one who knows how to fix it. Weird. You'd think the manager would know how to cancel a transaction. The manager kept me updated about how things are going but I got the feeling shr just wanted to get rid of  me. My feelings turned out to be True.   She finally waz able to cancel it told me to sign the void and left. No offer of any compensation no coupon for  free meal just a thank you and go. And I was stuck with a $145 hold on my account from the whole weekend till Tuesday the next week.  Now if only I could get ahold of the corporate office I still have the managers card.",

Regularly brunch is $29.99 but during the holidays its $34.99 and they don't even offer any holiday-ish items.... The Aria is a nice hotel and the buffet was clean and loads of options.

First of all, it was very expensive comparing with other buffet restaurants at 5-star hotels in town and their \"holiday buffet\" courses was not even 1/100 at other places.  Food was not fresh at all.  It is very salted and stale.  Food counters were not cleaned, neat, or organized at all.  Looked very dirty.  Their seafood section looked like food was dropping on the floor and being putting it back on the counter to continue serving customers.  Never eat noodle soup there.  It was very salty and spicy and didn't taste close to what it called \"pho.\"  Desserts were not good either.  Rum raisin ice cream tasted like drinking rum directly from the bottle.  Strawberry ice cream had no taste of strawberries.   So disgusting of the food here.  My boyfriend took a dump immediately after the meal.  I should have complained it to the hotel.  Never dine here ever again.",

    "text": "We probably should've read the reviews first, but the diversity of Asian food attracted me to this buffet, so we went on a whim. Unfortunately, the quality (of both the Asian and non-Asian food) was not that good. They do have a lot of different options, but for the price, I expect higher quality food in addition to the variety. Most of their entrees were forgettable. A few things make it 3 stars vs 2.  The good:  + The crab was good, but steamed crab is pretty common at this type of buffets.  + The made-to-order pasta. My husband liked the (red) sauce and the sun dried tomatoes. + The french toast was tasty. Fluffy and with the right amount of sweet and syrup - not overpowering. + The sesame balls! Cute sized, good texture and taste. + The nachos. Not really paying for an all-you-can-eat nacho bar though.  The meh: - Oily stir fry. I liked that they used wood ear mushrooms, but it was too greasy to enjoy. - The leaf-wrapped rice & chicken. While a unique offering, it tasted bland.  - The Indian food. Back home, we can get all-you-can-eat Indian buffets for $12 that taste better, so I didn't bother filling up on stuff that wasn't at least equal. - Non-distinct seafood dishes. It seemed like they put out two different clam/mussel entrees to look like they offered more, but in reality, the sauces didn't taste that much different. - Not that many interesting vegetarian dishes. All I can remember is a broccoli and cheese dish. Maybe some snap peas too. - Unsatisfying desserts. Neither my husband or I wanted to finish the ice cream. We tried a couple other things (flan, cookies, cannoli) but nothing did it for us. (I was excited about the flan too!) It sucks to spend a lot of money and leave still wanting to buy something else.  Everything else was forgettable. Sure, it filled us up, but I left feeling unsatisfied. For the price, I would prefer to eat somewhere else with higher quality and more creativity.",

Aria has many great options, sadly the Buffet at Aria is no longer one. The food is mass produced and has little attention to detail. Desserts taste as if they might be the day over left overs from the higher quality options onsite. If you are looking for a much better option- walk across the street to the Cosmo with Wicked Spoon. Aria could learn a lot from their buffet.",

    "text": "The boyfriend and I were here last week. I would rate this a 6/10 honestly, in comparison to the Bacchanal at Caesars and Wynn buffet. To begin with, when I called them to check for vegetarian options they told me they had plenty, with a dedicated tandoori section. Umm, not really :/ the tandoori section (which was just alright, nothing special Indian food) has a rice pilaf, couple curried and overcooked chicken tandoori. Other vegetarian dishes included quinoa salad, Asian soup, made to order veggie pasta, bread and cheese selection, Mac and cheese and salad and corn on Cobb. So, not worth the $28. If you enjoy sea food and meats in general, then maybe this place would be 7/10. The problem wasn't only the selection of food, but also the taste. It wasn't upto the Vegas standards, not bad just not good. Their dessert section was the saving grace. Lots of good desserts and our favorites were key lime pie, the chocolate cake, carrot cake, ice creams and the star was the pomegranate meringue which was absolutely yum!!! They also had tea, coffee or sodas and juices included in the price and you could add unlimited alcoholic drinks at $15 or something. Lastly, the staff was nice and courteous and i, by chance, met the chef, who was so sweet and polite.",

The dessert baked treats and the gelato wheel was a highlight. Very clean eating / serving areas. Probably won't come back for a brunch.",

Even at original price, I think this buffet is still worth the money.  As every Asian does, I get my fill off the expensive things during their lunch/dinner \"menu\". They have things like prime rib, king crab legs, and gelato. King crab legs are my go to. I grab a plate full of lemons. Create a king crab leg mountain on another. And just plop right back at my table to make my lemon/salt/pepper concoction. (The salt and pepper shakers can be opened from the bottom to make things easier on you)  I came here with my boyfriend and another couple. My friend really LOVED their flan. He says its the absolute best he's ever had. My personal favorite dessert from here would be the chocolate gelato. Every chocolate lover's dream! Nom. Haha.   Parking is easy to find in the structures. Service can be a bit iffy. Some servers are nicer than others and will serve you with a smile while others give off an attitude or kinda bitchy vibe. But that comes with all restaurants, so I let that slide.   Overall, this is a buffet I always find myself coming back to. 4/5 would come back (:",

The Lobster Bisque must have been mislabeled, as there wasn't any lobster, it was just bisque.  My lobster Mac and cheese was also missing lobster, and was cold.  On the plus side, the prime rib had good flavor, as did the peanut butter and pretzel gelato....so there's that.  All in all, I would definitely not recommend the Aria Buffet.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to try out Aria's the buffet with my MyVegas 2-for-1 reward.  Cost: 38$ for lunch When: Monday (1:05 PM)  Cons: long line wait (1 hour wait, so started eating at 2PM) and bad service originally (our server Mary Ann messed up drink orders, showed up only twice the entire time we were there (but we spotted her chatting with other servers on the side), etc. Other waitress rudely told us she won't help us because \"it's not my section\" when I asked if she could get us something to drink after we waited 16 minutes from first being seated).  Pro: cool food setup (gelato dessert rotating wheel and stone oven cooked tortilla), new server (Yugasov?) extremely hard working, decent variety of food, AMAZING tastes (nothing was overpoweringly seasoned or sauced, etc. It tasted like restaurant quality cuisine), and aesthetically pleasing layout.  Bathroom layout and cleanliness: 3.5 out of 5.  Overall: think it's worth a trip on a less busy day (use MyVegas or discounts). As other reviewers say, it's no Bacchanal Buffet, but it's still a delicious visit. So 7 out of 10 for me (due to wait and initial service).",

I forgot when they reopened this buffet, but it sure did taste much better this time around.   First off, HOT crab legs for lunch???? I'm so there!!! No other place have I seen warm crab legs for lunch... not to mention even having crab legs for lunch!! I had a plateful and they were sweet and juicy... drenched in butter, I happily set myself up for a heart attack, lol. The beer battered fish was also very good! The amount of food is not as numerous as other buffets... but the food they had was good. I also had clam chowder - very tasty and creamy. The curry from the Mediterranean station with the basmati rice was delicious.  The prime rib was well cooked (other places it was medium rare) and very tender and tasty. The thing I did not like was the BBQ pork bun... I'm Vietnamese and we are big on dim sum... and this did not hit the spot. It tasted weird to me. They also had har gow (shrimp dumplings)... average tasting. Dessert selection was a bit dismal compared to other buffets...not a big selection and nothing really stood out. They do have waffle cones for your ice cream!  Lunch was $22. A good deal actually since it includes seafood!! I left at 2:30pm, dinner starts at 3pm and did not see a line really... maybe because today is Tuesday?   In the end, a BIG improvement over the old buffet here... for the price, it's a pretty good deal, especially if you want more seafood stuff during lunch! But if you are looking for the vast selection at some other places, it's not really here. Service was good and my drink was always filled.",

French toast sticks were cold and the smell of seafood that early in the morning can be nauseating.   Wish it was better. Finished the meal with a scoop of gelato that was delicious!

There was about 15 shrimps left and I asked for more, and the lady working in that section told me there was no more because it is 9:15 ish and they would be closing soon. I was so disappointed since I am pregnant and shrimp is probably the safest while expecting. I literally cried because I spent almost 100 dollars only for shrimp, and a piece of carrot cake.

The desserts are incredible, the pancakes were so good, they had fried chicken and waffles, tons of salads and fruit, so much fresh seafood, Mexican station, Italian station, omelet station, carving station, sushi station, dumplings, egg rolls, pho bowls, cereal, muffins, bagels, you name it they have it!

Meats were like rubber and the Italian section looked like it had been there for hours untouched. The mac and cheese had a skin over it and the Asian section had a weird smell. Dinner rolls were like 5 day old hockey pucks. The service was terrible and when we asked for a manager the server told us the manager was \"tied up\" and we really needed to talk to the chef because he is the one who cooks the food. We went up to the cashier area and finally a manager met us with the chef. The manager was rude, nasty and when we explained our concerns she ripped the check out of my hand and rudely told the cashier to refund our money. Then, the chef implied we were crazy because he stated \" we were the only ones today to complain about his food\". After we received our refund, the manager said \"have a good night and please leave\".  So we were asked to leave because we did not like the buffet. Save yourself the agony and go to the buffet at Caesars Palace. We ended up going there the next night and fell in love. It is twice the size and $54.99 per person and WELL worth it!!!! Aria needs to listen to its' guests and reviews. Their ego is too big to accept they need to improve!!!!",

    "text": "Well my wife decided that we would try the buffet while staying at the Aria hotel and having dined at their restaurant the Pub the night before and enjoying the food.  Absolutely the worst buffet I have ever been to. Not even sure where to begin. I am not even sure if a real Chef is running this place! To start it off they did not have any Prime Rib the entire time I was there. Mind you we came for dinner at 8 pm and they are open until11-12 I believe. The person carving the meats said some would be coming out, but none was forthcoming and I checked many times. Very limited selection of food. Most of it looked like it had been sitting out for a while. They did have crab legs, only problem was they were placed out in a small wok sized pan that only contained enough for maybe 4-5 people and then they were gone again. There was one lady throwing a few in a pot of water next to the display counter but the pot was too small and there was no way she could keep with the demand. I have never seen anything like this.   I mainly came for the prime rib and some mashed potatoes. With no prime rib I did try the mashed potatoes, no gravy anywhere to be found, with some beef something that they were serving up. The potatoes were very bland and dry.  The beef was Ok, nothing to write home about. After passing the various stations and seeing nothing that looked appetizing, and a very limited selection at that, I decided that maybe this meal can be salvaged with some excellent desert. WRONG!!! Even they were tasteless.    Save your money and go elsewhere. We had room service the first night here and it was excellent, including the desserts we ordered.  Maybe stick with that out of convenience.",

As usual we pay for breakfast price (10:40) and get to eat bf and lunch ..$20 per person and child 4 yr. and under eat free. I don't really like it here, they don't have much selection.  The Chinese sucks, Indian is blah, sandwiches were alright. The only good thing is hot crab legs!! Their Dessert is really good... Flan is one of the best, my favorite is square coconut macaroon to die for..hehe.. I still think Bacchanal buffet is my #1 pick",

    "text": "Weekday morning breakfast buffets for $17.99 is not too shabby!    Keep in mind to go around 10:30AM so you can hit the breakfast as well as the lunch items.  If you decide to go earlier, you may end up running out of things to eat.  For me, I love variety so that was a huge bonus.  The lunch items come out at 11:00AM so everything was freshly prepared and hot.  Tips: -Go for the warm/hot snow crab legs (much better than the cold ones) -Clam chowder was great and you can put in some freshly cooked clams from another section of the buffet too.  They're in a big pot. -They have congee that you can add preserved eggs and bbq pork -Fresh naan bread made in front of you -The dessert section is big and have a variety of sugarless items -Loved the gelato and sorbets -Washrooms are located inside the restaurant, -less walking",

Most of the food items were mislabled (they were in front of the wrong item or signs leftover from breakfast, like french toast, when it obviously wasn't french toast or didn't have any labels at all - they had some generic sign that said something like EFT-1 (or something similar). So, there were a lot of items that we weren't sure what they were. The quality of the food was decent. It wasn't a buffet that I would go back to or tell people that they need to eat there.   Our server (I think her name was Linda) was awesome.",

I love red velvet cupcakes but they didn't have any. Just red velvet macaroons. Salad bar was blah. But let's face it you don't win friends with salad.  The dim sum selections were OK for the most part. Clearly not as good as a dedicated Asian restaurant but not awful like a $10 Asian buffet either.   So overall I sum this place up as being OK at everything. Nothing sucked really bad but nothing was amazingly awesome either.",

Indian was divine, brunch was fantastic & the best carrot cake I've had in many years. Everything had a little pizazz and I loved the cheeses and fresh fruits. Great selection for vegetarians as well. Yummy desserts, lovely ambience and moderately priced. You can spend more elsewhere for less satisfying food.  The only reason I didn't 5 star this establishment is the service is a bit poor. The workers don't really want to be there but to be fair, who does? Our server, Sonny walked up to us and said, \"What do you want to drink?\" That's it and when I asked for our table to be cleaned because there was syrup on it, he dropped two beverage napkins over it and said it's good. And that was that. We never saw him again, even to get a spoon. Had to steal it from another table. Other than that I would revisit this buffet. Definitely one of the better ones on the strip.",

There was sushi (which was warm, literally melting and not fresh), mussels and later crab legs, but literally no fish, like salmon or whatever. Also several dishes ran out, naan bread and pizza, no chicken in sight. My total impression was that the staff was overwhelmed and couldn't keep up. Some were nice and polite, like the lady at the deserts counter, but overall not great. Deserts were wonderful and delicious, that I must admit.  I wish someone had told us we could check in from the room. Or at least have check in stations like the Bacchanal. If we hadn't waited a ridiculous amount of time, we might have enjoyed it more.",

Italian included pizza which was basic  I found the sushi/sashimi/poke bowls to be a good option but again nothing special  My favorite item was the carved turkey breast (lean and flavorful with the gravy) There was a carving station with a variety of meats (beef, pork, turkey breast, deep fried chicken, whole chicken) pancakes ( carrot cake, regular and red velvet flavor)   The pancake was super sweet, moist and delicious (but definitely filling and should be treated like a dessert)  Dessert was delicious! From the ice cream to the pastries... so many varieties. mmmm. save room because it's a sweet treat!  I enjoyed the cake pop - it was moist with a chocolate nutty coating.

I know that it is important to eat healthy, but this place will make anyone excited.   Aria has the most convenient buffet out of all of the Vegas buffets I have tried. I have experienced wicked spoon, buchanel, the venetian buffet, flamingo buffet and Bellagio buffet. None of these are convenient although the food can have better selections than aria. Aria has many desserts of high quality: creme Brulee, muffins, Gelato, macaroons, pie, cobblers and Panna cotta. The food is of highest quality: crab legs, sirloin, prime rib, oysters, clams, rib eye steak and sushi.    There are booths all around the place. Waiters and waitresses are friendly and give you the best service money can buy. The good thing is that I'm telling you that this place is heaven on earth, but there are also some bad things like any place. However, the bad things are not so bad. The price range for each person is 30-45$ unless on Saturdays and Sundays. This could include holidays being on the 100$ range. The food can be hit or miss on lunch, but dinner has all the good stuff.    If you are wondering where to eat, aria buffet, buchannel and Bellagio buffet are my favorite. Hope this helps!",

We went to this buffet on 3 separate occasions for breakfast or lunch and had pretty much the same experience every time: lines were too long, servers were indifferent, drinks were too weak. It was pretty convenient though as we stayed at Aria. I suggest you look at some other breakfast/lunch options even within Aria (the crepe place was pretty amazing). Overall I won't recommend this place.",

    "text": "All of the MGM resorts buffets nowadays tastes well mediocre to horrible. As this buffet may look super appetizing it does not taste as great as it did when it first opened years ago. The buffet has a more limited selection versus other buffets but that means there should be more quality integrated into the food but they failed to do that. This place is all looks no flavor for a robbery of $35   Plate 1:  - \"cowboy\" steak / the carver asked me how i wanted the steak and I said medium and gave me a dry piece of shit cardboard oh and they just pile 4 different meats in one cutting board so yeah I'm that's mildly gross.  - mac n cheese / tasted okay as in edible  - mini burger slider / dry like the desert outside  Plate 2: - self grab Thai tea / the best thing I've had here and that's sad  - rotisserie chicken / tastes almost like Costco's which is great and it wasn't dry  - shrimp fried rice / felt like I stuck my tongue in the ocean .... so much salt  Plate 3:  - pepperoni pizza / nothing special but decent  - spinach dip w chips / my favorite thing here food wise as there is an even ratio of chips and dip but such a cheap food to create.  Plate 4:  - prime rib / not bad but pretty small to a point you won't notice it compared to the other meats ( i guess they don't want you to find it because it's the most expensive meat there )  - iced crab legs / decent but very small and not super meaty  ( THEY MAKE THE EXPENSIVE FOOD SEEM LOWKEY) Plate 5 desert:  - banana fosters / so sweet that you can't taste the bananas  After that I left feeling well upset that this place is housed with various fine dining options yet I couldn't at least eat one thing that tastes super great. If you want a modern buffet experience with great taste I recommend the M resort's buffet !!  ( 2 stars for the interior design of the buffet because it's very appealing and simple )",

If you're looking for quality of food for the price you pay, this might not be the best place to go. It's about $50 for a weekend dinner and the food was OK and I don't think I would be coming back. I think we should've spent slightly more and went to Wicked Spoon.   Also, a couple of people from the wedding party weren't able to join us for dinner because they got sick but the host still got charged for the missing people. What a rip off.

The seating hostess seemed a bit overwhelmed and unorganized.  Once seated, our server met us right away, was very pleasant and took our drink order and invited us to the buffet. The room was very spacious , attractive and comfortable. Many selections in all areas but those tending to the stations seemed not to be able to keep up with the dishes..many serving trays were depleted and unclean...all of the Asian dishes were so salty that we couldn't eat them...pho, chicken gumbo, shumai, Asian noodles/pancit...terrible!  Even with these observations being corrected, the price of this buffet is too high; as well, you're gonna pay $7.50 an hour to park after having your vehicle inspected by security...not worth the hassle.",

    "text": "More like 3.5 stars. $40 + tax for a \"gourmet dinner\" buffet. Pretty typical rate for a Vegas buffet.   The buffet at Aria does come with a serving of lobster and bottomless wine (between chardonnay or merlot). Yes, the Vegas drunkenness continues through dinner! Anyway, we came right around 4pm which was the start time for their gourmet dinner and there wasn't really a line. Didn't really fill up until about 6pm. Yes, I ate for over two hours and I'm damn proud of it.  The lobster seemed overcooked and tough. It was too dry which made it pretty tough to chew. Oh well. Not bad still. Prime rib was amazing. Perfectly executed.. Great outer layer of spice and nice and bloody...just how I like it. There was also a lamb roast that was also really great. It was really tender and had just the right amount seasoning on it. Crab legs were fine. Very fresh and easy to pick off its shell. The lemons suck though. You'd be lucky to get 5 drops out of them (I need my lemons!). They also had Indian dishes like Tandoori chicken and various curries, but I didn't really try it. Pizza and pasta bar, etc. etc. Nothing special. Not too many other options.   Dessert was okay. They didn't have creme brulee :( The gelato was nice. Mixed berry was my fave. Banana creme was probably the best cake there. Other than that, nothing else worth mentioning for the dessert.  Service was decent. I think our original server was pretty good at checking in for taking plates off our table and refilling our wine. The whole plates thing got annoying though because I wanted a plate to keep my crab shells on there. Oh well. Lastly, I think after her shift was done, the person who replaced her didn't really check in with us. I guess I just ate for too long and they got tired of us lol  Overall, I'd probably still choose Bellagio over Aria. More options, better desserts, and better lemons lol. If I do come back to Aria, I'd make sure to ask my server if they could give more servings of lobster!",

The food spread was quite diverse with the sections being divided into several types including sweets, Chinese, Mediterranean, Indian, Carvery. However, the quality of the food was quite disappointing. The Chinese dumplings, soups tasted like it was heated from packaged products. The potatoes and sausages seemed quite oily and salty. Even the Mediterranean and indian food was pretty bland considering the typical spices that go into them. For 20 bucks, I think it is ok but certainly didn't impress me at all.",

For $30+ (Brunch on Saturday) I would rather grab something smaller, not AYCE or hit another buffet. Vegas has too much to offer to settle on this place ... unless you're too drunk to scurry elsewhere, then you're screwed.  The scarce highlights include:  - The company - if you bring good company, apparently, you can spend HOURS in this place picking at food and sucking up all the champagne your body can handle.   - The Service - For the most part, the cashiers and servers were friendly.   - Breakfast Pizza - it has sunny-side up eggs on it!  - Mint Whoopie Pie - I only picked it up because it was the most attractive thing I saw on the food line. The center cream stuff was good. I didn't eat the rest if it.",

I think that the standouts of it for me were the beef brisket and the already cracked crab legs although I wish the latter would have been served warm and not cold.  What I was disappointed in was that there was no traditional salad bar.  In its place was an area with many different pre-made salads.  The desserts were good as well although one of my companions had a hair in his butterfinger gelato.  The bottom line for me is that I would probably not come back here in the future.  The food was solid but I believe that I can do much better for the price we paid on the strip.",

Large square layout of food in ultra modern setting with spacious seating.  Our server was good about keeping up with our large party but I'm stunned they would not put the coffee pot down on the table. Guess to much waste is take on it.  Either way she was pretty good about it.   Starts on one side with an impressive array of pastries, cookies and pies and every other baked good known to man.  Followed by a Asian display of various items I normally don't eat for breakfast.  Then you move around and stage 3 is blintzes and crepes and various cold cuts.   You make the turn and it's your standard breakfast fare with eggs, bacon, sausage.  Keep going Pizza 4 types including an egg breakfast pizza.  And on to pancakes and waffles. OH WAIT Mexican Station, with breakfast burriottos etc.    OK not full yet omelets station and carving station with giant fresh sausage and ham.  throw in some free range chicken being carved right there as well.  Undaunted and want more how about bagels various crazy type creme cheeses and spreads followed by a large fruit display along with country biscuits and gravy YUM!  GOD HELP ME I'm about to burst.   I know I know all buffets are like this.  Well maybe so, but place was laid out nicely food was hot and fresh and tasty and service very good. For $15.00 how can you go wrong especially since a coffee and one pastry at the take out coffee shop costs about $9.00.  I don't understand the negative reviews at all. remember you are reviewing this as a buffet not comparing a $16.00 breakfast extravaganza against Smith & Wolenskis.  Your reviews need to reflect the type of business and compare it against other similar types.   If comparing to Buffets well Top Shelf folks. A definite repeat",

The clams were good and the dim sum was excellent but other brunch items were standard.  Our server gave us attitude at first but eventually came around after we made it clear that we noticed his negative behavior. Overall it was a decent brunch, but given the plethora of brunch options in Vegas.  Next time i will pass.",

Of course since it's breakfast, there won't be as much selection as the dinner menu so that is understandable. For the price, you can't beat it. Everything tasted pretty good from the savory foods to the dessert. Nothing really stood out, but I think you get your moneys worth.  The customer service was friendly and nice.  The environment was modern looking, a bit plain, but not bad.  I would want to come back and try the dinner menu. Hopefully it will be just as good if not better than their breakfast menu =]",

As for the food:  They have an Indian, Chinese and Mexican sections  *No raw oysters. They only had some grilled and they were meh *Crab legs were good *Everything else is meh *Display was very boring *Fresh naan is good *Sushi was very bad, rice was hard, it hardly had any fish *They also have a Poke station but I didn't bother *Paella was very salty *Prime rib and steak were hard and lacked flavor *Pho was actually not bad, just noodles but the soup was nice and sweet  For Desserts, they had gelato, carrot cake, pumpkin pie, berry tart, caramel puff and lots of cookies and pop corn. So basically a lot of the cheaper options.  Overall, not impressed and would not return.",

We really only had 45 mins till closing to gather our food, but that was plenty of time for me.  I would give more stars but they had no gluten free items, besides a cookie I saw in the dessert section. They did however had a bunch of vegetarian options, which I was surprised since most buffets cater to the 'meat and seafood' eaters. What I did find was really good and I went back up for seconds. I also found every desert that could be GF minus the chocolate cake and red velvet cookie. And for the dessert, I don't recommend that strawberry cheesecake they had, it had the consistency of a pineapple upside down cake as the 'strawberry' glaze on top. Unless you like the 'fake strawberry' topping I'm sure you'll love it.   Food was good, wish we had more time to eat. Note that the pricing is outrageous to eat.. but you're in ARIA so the name goes with the price tag, I suppose ??!",

First I tried to make a reservation from the room but no luck. I let the person in the reservation line about this and she was going to bring me in but I would have to pay full price. Um, no. I was then told to get in the line next to where I was (they all held some sort of cards). I stayed in that line which was long. I got to the front when I was then told that I was in the wrong line so had to go to this insanely long line. If we were told to go there first, at least we would have been 1/2 way through by this time, but the line only got longer.  I did talk to the  manager who came when we were at the front of that extremely long line. She only said that I had been in the wrong line. Um, obviously I knew that by this time.  She eventually comped us drinks but an apology would have been okay to start with.  Once in, the food was D E L I C I O U S !!!! There was no issue with the food.  Service: A bit slow and we had to wave our person down a couple of times.   BTW, not that we paid for our drinks, but we did learn that they no longer have the Pay $13 for all you can drink for 2 people. It's now per person. Keep that in mind when deciding on this.  So, food good, service, meh!",

This place was massive and had different types of food from Chinese, Japanese, italiana and of course American.   I was disappointed they didn't have a lot of sushi options, but they did have an option for a poki bowl and that satisfied my craving for sushi. I was craving for Asian food that night so I mostly just stuck with that option.  I thought the food was great. My GF didn't think the crab legs were all that .  She said they weren't a good size.  Desert was also good. They had ice cream and different assortment of cakes.   It was a happy visit and will certainly return again.",

Can't complain since it was free but I was disappointed compared to the last time I ate here. Upon checking in, I asked for a window seat since I spotted many empty seats by the window and the mean lady named, Hope had a cow. She was acting as if I asked for her paycheck or something. She said no and quickly started putting reserved sign on all the tables by the window...Rude!!!!  Food is ok but I got tired of eating same thing every single day. They don't change their menu. I hoped to see some lamb dishes, fish and fried chicken but none of these items were there.",

I used a 2-for-1 offer from myVEGAS so we only paid $42 for the two of us, excluding tip.   Pros:   - Seafood! They had chilled crab legs, mussels, clams, and peeled shrimp, but the best part was that they also served steamed crab legs! Yup, that's right, you don't have to ask them to steam them for you. It's already been done :) My personal favorites were also their steamed mussels and steamed clams! Both dishes were perfectly cooked and their accompanying sauces were HEAVENLY. (The clams were in a white, butter/garlic sauce, and as for the mussels, well, I quite honestly am not sure, but it was pretty darn good.) They also had a poke bar, which I did not try, but it looked like their fish was pretty fresh.   - Meat! Well, at least according to my boyfriend, the self-proclaimed king of meat. He made multiple trips to the carving station for their brisket, which he would not stop raving for hours after our meal. Their beef ribs were also cooked perfectly, with the meat falling off the bone. He did note that a couple of their meat dishes were overseasoned.   Cons:  - Selection was pretty limited. It's not a huge buffet. I mainly stuck to eating the same few dishes, since the rest of the buffet didn't appeal too much to me. Besides seafood and meat, there was Asian cuisine (pho, tonkatsu ramen, dim sum, etc.), a salad bar, desserts, classic American food, Mediterranean food (basically just some dips), and Indian food.  - I likely wouldn't pay full price to eat at this buffet. Unless they had more quality dishes and fewer average ones, I'd return only if I had a discount offer again.",

In addition there were grilled vegetables pastas potatoes as well as a variety of difference cuisines such as Chinese Italian and East Indian foods.

I also like the more modern looking interior. Everything at the meat carving station was well seasoned and the meat was very moist, not dry at all. The scalloped potatoes and short rib were also so good.   Of course the star is all the seafood and it didn't disappoint. The poke bar, king crab, snow crab, and stone crab were all excellent although the shrimp cocktail and oysters Rockefeller weren't my favorite. One small complaint is that at the Bellagio, the crab legs are sliced open so it's exceedingly easy to just indulge in crab, but here you need to crack it open yourself.  The desserts were also very good. Plenty of options and all of them that I tried (7!!) were done well.   Service is also friendly and, for the most part, prompt. Nothing that I had tasted bad - overall, very pleased!",

The person managing this buffet should be FIRED!!!  That's not fair that the buffet doesn't make an effort to seat customers in a timely manner. There was so much variation in the food as well. Some of the food was not kept at a safe temperature as my food when I brought it back to my table was cold. The majority of the food items that I got were too salty. I liked the variety of ethnic food, but the wait for the buffet was unacceptable especially if there were such an abundance of open tables. Who wants to wait in line during their vacation? I certainly don't.",

    "text": "Always been a fan of buffets, but instead of the major ones such as Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal, went for one off the beaten path. That's where I ended up at Aria.  It was brunch for father's day so it was slightly more expensive then normal ($38.99 / person) but drinks were included (non-acloholic of course). No line when we got there around 3 PM, so don't expect the same wait as the bigger vegas buffets (unless the timing as just off). The waitress was very nice, but seemed understaffed since it took 10 min for her to get to us and get our first drink orders in. She quickly learned to bring us double of drinks so she doesn't have to run back and forth everytime.  The food selection was fairly extensive (even though it doesn't seem it from a first glance). Easily 100+ menu items with every kind of sauce, guac, topping, you can think of. The meats were all very delicious (special shoutout to the BBQ brisket, prime rib was good, and rotissere chicken was surprising). Standard comfort foods were good (mashed potates and mac and cheese), grilled veggies were a nice surprise. Indian and Mexican food was ok, probably your average indian buffet level / average mexican joint. Seafood was good as well (mussels, clams), though they ran out of gumbo for a demerit. Asian food wasn't that appetizing.  Desserts were the highlight, each of them were delicious and I had to stop myself from going back for more. Definitely wouldn't mind coming back if I was in the area, but wouldn't go out of the way.",

    "text": "Unfortunately we were quite disappointed with our experience with the Aria buffet, not because of the wait (we are M life members so our wait was less than a few minutes as we got to skip the lines, which admittedly were quite long), not because of the food (we thought there were plenty of good options), but because of the service. Not sure why, maybe because you actually give gratuity before you're seated so it's a done deal, but the service was absolutely horrendous. Like so bad that all the delicious crab legs in the world couldn't convince me to come here again (ok maybe they could, but I would need to be specifically craving crab legs)!  So why did we think the service was terrible? Well, our drink orders were not taken for a good 15 minutes, our waiter actually never cleaned our plates until I personally had to find another waiter and ask for them to clear plates, and when I ordered soft drinks a second time around after we had been sitting for less than 1.5 hours, the waiter said we have been there for more than 2 hours so he cannot give us any drinks. I had to convince him that we had been there for less than 2 hours (which is easy to do since you have the check with a timestamp on it, but I shouldn't need to do that), deal with his attitude, for just a glass of water. It was just annoying when we are trying to enjoy a long lunch. If I had been there for more than 2 hours then yes I could've understood where he is coming from, but i wasn't aware that the buffet came with a side of attitude.  As to the food, there are plenty of options here. The underrated section is the Italian one where they have bone marrow and a delicious lamb dish, that I personally thought was the best food item they had in the entire buffet. As other reviewers noted, the lines for the crab legs can get quite long, so beware. The dessert area looks like it had plenty of food, but nothing was that impressive.  Overall, crab legs. Bad service. But tons of food and variety, so if there's not a long line (or you're an M life member and can skip the lines) and you want to eat a variety of food and you think the cost is worth it, give it a try. Just beware that your plates may never be cleaned, you may never get a server to come to your table, and you may be told you can't get a drink because you've exceeded their 2 hour limit even though you obviously have not (again, good thing you can prove this to the server very easily with the check, but why do you even have to deal with this when the server has never once stopped by your table after the initial drink orders and you want another soft drink).",

Our original plan was to check out the Bacchanal Buffet Buffet in Caesar's but one of my coworkers recommended this place because while it doesn't have as many choices (there are still tons to choose from), its more affordable compared to Bacchanal Buffet.   I came here with the parents on a Saturday morning around 9am. Surprisingly, there was already a line formed. If you want to avoid any lines, you probably have to come earlier.  Inside, the place is extremely clean and well put together. We were kindly shown to a table by the windows so we got an excellent view of the outside pool area with the palm trees.  Now, onto the food! After you get a table and walk over to the buffet area, you will be shocked by the choices of dishes available. They include Asian, Mexican, steak, seafood, breakfast food, Spanish food and even a gelato station. If you're into fresh seafood, they have these amazing clams and mussels as well as crab legs and really fresh cocktail shrimp.  The service here is excellent as well. We came around the holiday time so we got the $39.99 holiday brunch per person. For the experience of a Vegas brunch buffet, this was definitely worth every penny!",

We were staying in the Vdara and decided to walk over to the Aria's The Buffet one night. We were both extremely hesitant to try another buffet and I was almost nauseated waiting in line for crab expecting the worst after our other buffet experience (it was dry and had no flavor). We were very pleased.  The food was fresh and amazing even down to the minutes before closing. The arrangement of the food was also much easier to access and the variety was great (Indian, Chinese, Italian, Japanese, etc). The meat section and even poke bowl sections were great. The desserts were good but I will admit the only thing at the Bacchanal that was great were the desserts. There was even a pasta station but we were too stuffed to try it.  We enjoyed the food so much we actually returned for brunch which was amazing as well. The French roasts and omelette station was great.",

Since our weekend was full of trying new things with familiar faces, we all decided to try it out. The wait went by fairly quickly; we came around 12:30pm with a group of 4 and were seated within 15 minutes of when we arrived in line. The place itself is pretty open; it seems updated, but has a fairly simple design.   Service was pretty great. Our drinks were never empty and our plates were cleared quickly. As for the food, I thought the variety was pretty exceptional. They had tons of seafood (mostly cold, which I wasn't a super fan of)-- crawfish, 2 different types of mussels, crab legs, sushi, smoked salmon, smoked cod, and a bunch of cooked fish. The crawfish was pretty gross but the other cold seafood dishes were decent. I preferred the cooked fish dishes. There was a bread section, a carving section, Mediterranean, Asian (dim sum), charcuterie, Italian, Indian, breakfast foods, salad bar, seafood station, and dessert station (I may be missing a couple here). My favorite part of this buffet was the made-to-order eggs benedict station! You can choose a traditional benedict, a smoked salmon benedict, or a snow crab benedict-- it definitely makes a difference when made fresh! The creme de la creme was the dessert section! I was so full by this time that I was only able to get a scoop of the mint chip gelato from the rotating ice cream display, but the other desserts looked on point.   I thought the price was well worth it here. This is one of the few buffets in Vegas I wouldn't mind revisiting!",

The setting is beautiful, with a view of the pool complex and a lot of natural light. I love the trend towards using natural light that is in the newer Vegas properties.   Both of my experiences have been with the lunch selections. I love that for an extra ten dollars, you can add on bottomless Mimosas or Blood Marys. This is a bargain and the servers keep your glasses full. Services is great here.  The food is high quality and I although I felt like it had a smaller selection that other similar buffets (Wynn/Bellagio), I still found plenty to enjoy. Aria, like other high end buffets, has crab leg already cracked. As far as I am concerned, this is the only way to eat crab legs. I don't like fighting with my food! My boyfriend's mom found plenty of vegetarian options that she enjoyed.    My only complaint is the that the shrimp cocktail comes in little cups of two. At most buffets, this is my favorite item and I can eat a bunch. Granted, you can technically take as many cups as you want, but it seems that the demand is higher than they can keep up with. The presentation is nice in the cups, but they should just put it on a platter and let people help themselves.  This is a great buffet in a beautiful hotel and I'm looking forward to my next visit!",

Anyway, it's a Saturday night and we got there at about 6pm.  i expected to have about a 30 min or so wait but there was no wait.  The place was about 3/4 full.  They had a good assortment of dishes including Alaskan king crab, snow crab, salmon sushi, smoked salmon, rolls, Indian food (garlic naan, vegetable curry, etc.), chinese food, soup, prime rib, lamb, pizza, etc.  The dessert section was excellent.  I loved the flan, gelato, cookies, etc.  I think the quality was good because there was a good number of people eating so they were turning over the food pretty quickly.  At the same time, it wasn't so packed that you had to wait a long time or other people would take all of the good stuff as soon as it comes out.  In short, it was great.  Each person gets 1/2 of a lobster and the size and quality was pretty good for that as well.  I liked this experience more than the Wynn or Bellagio which are the 2 other notable comps.",

    "text": "You know the buffet is doing an awful job when it's customers leave hungry.  I went to the omelette station and ordered a vegetable omelette with fresh eggs. I noticed Leopold put egg beaters in there, so I told him that I wanted fresh eggs. He gave me the stink eye and said \"it's the same\". I said I didn't want egg beaters, so he dumped it out and put some vegetables in the pan again, but this time he didn't let it cook, resulting in a very runny omelette. Also the eggs were undercooked, salmonella anyone?  I think we had a server, but it could have been the abominable snowman cause I never saw them. We didn't have spoons to stir our coffee with, so made do with the handles of our knives.  I was really not impressed with the selection of food, the ones that I did try were disgusting. I thought, I'll just have a bagel. It was a brick!  My wife and I had only taken a few bites and decided to leave and go somewhere else to eat.  The only reason I'm giving this place two stars is because I complained to the manager on the way out and she was genuinely concerned about the experience and refunded our money.",

    "text": "***For the lunch buffet only***  With good reason, I'm not usually much of a fan of Vegas buffets.  However, it was lunchtime, the gf and I were hungry, we had a $100 resort credit to use, and the ARIA is an upscale casino-resort.  So we figured the Buffet at ARIA would be a safe bet.  Unlike most other casinos, the Buffet at ARIA is not located just off or even near the casino floor.  Instead, it's on the second floor/Promenade level with several of the casino's fine dining restaurants.  The dining room is smaller than other buffets, yet open, well-lit by natural light coming in from floor to ceiling windows, airy, but with a weird, almost IKEA design aesthetic.  I could be very wrong about that last comment, but it was what came to mind when I entered the restaurant.    The Buffet at ARIA offered culinary representation from many of the more popular international cuisines. The buffet's major draw seemed to be the Snow Crab legs as evidenced by the crowd of diners that were picking over the crab leg offerings like vultures over a rotting carcass.  Sadly, the crab legs were spindly, with little meat, and mealy for what little meat was present.  The selection of sushi rolls also failed to inspire much faith in the kitchen as the rice lacked moisture and the fillings were largely flavorless, relying on wasabi and soy sauce to provide the entire flavor profile.  Despite these and several other misses, all was not lost on the buffet.  The Indian chicken curry was actually one of the best tasting chicken curries that I've ever had.  It seemed to possess with all of the hoped for Indian spice and didn't taste \"dumbed down\" for Western palates.  The Chili Verde was a successful offering as the chunks of pork were nicely tender and bathing in a flavorful roasted green chili and tomatillo stew.  The lunch buffet with tax for two was $53.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't quite up to the price tag.  Fortunately, even though the food was largely lackluster, service was spot on.  Our water glasses were filled with frequency and dirty plates never lingered on our table for more than a minute or two.    In the end, I only give the Buffet at ARIA 2 stars for food and value received, but added 1 star for the solid service.  Next time, I'll just stick to the Bellagio buffet or skip buffets altogether.",

    "text": "One of the better tasting buffets that I have tried in my lifetime. They had a pretty good selection of food and desserts. If you see a dessert you like before you even started eating, just grab it!! I saw delicious looking creme brulee and by the time I went back after I finished my food, there were no more :(  I don't usually eat crab legs, but since I payed so much for the buffet I thought I might as well give it a shot. I liked how they had the legs cut open already so it was easy to pick the meat out with a fork. The meat was sweet and tender :) it was delicious with some lemon juice and butter! I'm glad I gave it a chance.  Had to pay around $36 for the Holiday Dinner price since I came here on Thanksgiving. Pricey. But way more worth it the Cafe Vettro located in Aria also.   I think the server for my table sucked. She brought us our drinks and everyone else at my table had a straw for their drink except for me. I asked her kindly for a straw and she handed me a straw that was in a Coke.... she handed it to me while it was still dripping with Coke and I just looked really disgusted as I grabbed it. She probably realized she shouldn't have done that after she saw my face and she quickly grabbed it away from me again. I don't know what she was thinking.",

We came down for breakfast and around 930 and even though there was practically no line we stood around waiting to be seated for nearly ten minutes.  From there came the strange and sadly disappointing selection of food. The eggs were top notch but past that is was all downhill. At 930 in the morning I'm not sure why there is more ethnic selections than breakfast food.   The two stars come purely off service alone once we were actually seated. Perhaps it's better at dinner but as a whole, we were highly disappointed and will not be back.",

All shrimps was in shells and with legs, the crab legs was so soft you could not open it with carb crackers, The taste was good though. The dessert choice was great, but it wasn't too tasty for me.

None of other hotels were still charging holiday pricing so I'm not entirely sure why they charged a premium price and nothing really extra was offered in terms of food variety.  The selection of food was underwhelming. carving station had rotisserie chicken, prime rib and sausages, all overcooked and dry, italian section only offered pizza, Indian section offered vegetarian and meat options but lamb and chicken curries had no meat in them. I was expecting better seafood but all they had was cocktail shrimp, mussels and crab. The snow crab legs were tiny and overly salty.  Dessert options were also very limited (I've seen more variety at much cheaper buffets). While they did have some premium variety over normal buffets - duck confit salad, oysters rockefeller, peking duck, lamb, I wouldn't pay extra for the buffet at the Aria just for these options.  Lastly, the buffet was very understaffed, I was there for over an hour and saw my waiter twice. I had to wait 1/2 hour for soda and couldn't stand the wait for coffee. The buffet at the Aria clearly doesn't live up to the Hotel's rep. I advise shopping around, a lot of the other hotels have buffets with much more variety and better quality for a lower price.",

    "text": "We stayed at the ARIA for a national meeting and my coworkers and I decided to have the brunch buffet at this place and we all walked out so happy with our decision. They had so much choices from ordering a poke bowl, making your own omelet, meditterenean, pizza, seafood with legit crab legs, salad bar, asian, breakfast food, everything! The dessert station was so good too wherein they had alot of mini pastries that are so good. They have gelatos that are really good as well and so many flavors! The staff were just so inviting and accommodating. The utensils were complete and your plate and drinks get refilled so often. There are also a variety of drinks found in the buffet area such as horchata, strawberry lime drink, etc. You have to get it though and pour in a shot glass size glass. They are so good!! There is a long line however so plan to arrive early. This is where I would retract a star and because the corn I had was dry probably because of the light that was over it. The $30 is SO WORTH IT and very affordable for this kind of buffet. Come with an empty stomach and you will be so glad you went here. It is conveniently located inside the hotel.",

    "text": "I was between giving this 3 or 4 starts, and settled on 4, just because I LOVE DESSERTS. That being said, here's the low-down.  Food: +Excellent variety of foods. You got your pizzas (I wanted to try the Margherita pizza, but no room!), your Indian foods (tandoori chicken and curry and basmati rice and such), your Chinese foods(which I think were done quite well! I guiltily enjoyed my chow fun and friend rice, even knowing how cheaply filling they were), little noodle cups(the green tea soba noodles with peanut chicken was my fave), sushi(not an awesome selection, but it's there), sliced and carved meats, king and snow crab legs already sliced in their shell(though they were just average), a selection of cold meats and cheeses, etc... +DESSERTS. I have an insatiable sweet tooth, so this really was the cherry on the cake for me. The chocolate-covered puff cereal/marshmallow clusters were simple and delicious, the creme brulee wasn't fancy but I still loved me some runny custard, and the Grand Marnier creme puff was beautifully decorated and awesomely edible, every part. What else...they had bananas foster, fancy schmancy whoopie pies, blondies, cobblers, cheesecakes...soooo many options! +Free red wine? I think I heard that right. It was offered to me, but I declined, so I can't say much about that.  Service: -Not great. Sat there for a little while after we were seated, and no one came so we just went to get our food. We were probably halfway through our first plates when we finally got our waters.  Other: +/- They automatically bring lobster to your table, even if you don't ask for it. Good if you like lobster(it's nothing exceptional, though. I found it to be dry, but not terrible), bad if you're already full by that time or not a lobster fan and then you feel sorry letting lobster go to waste. - Plan to get there a little early if you think you'll be hungry. This is not a walk-up-and-get-your-food buffet. There is a line, and you wait to be seated. They will also seat people who are behind you in line if they have tables for parties of that size. - $40 a person. In this case, buffet != cheap eats. I think the variety of food offered made it worth the price, but just be aware of this going in.  Overall: Expensive but probably justifiably so. Service not great. Variety was awesome, but quality of food varied. Not all great, but there were some gems in there, and if you're a foodie, it's pretty fun to try everything and find some delicious stuff.",

If I eat at a buffet in Vegas, I usually go to to the buffet at Wynn, which is excellent. The prime rib at the Aria was more like a Sunday night roast, and the rest of the entrees were marginal at best. I thought the food and service was so bad that I would not  eat there again even if they offered it for free. Maybe that's the reason they included the free buffet as part of the vacation package!

    "text": "If Aria, a 5-star hotel, is going to offer a buffet, you'd expect it to be spectacular or at least up to par. Bellagio has it, so why not Aria, right? I  came here with my family yesterday--truly DISAPPOINTED! My mom took a bite of the cold cut meat and spat it out because it had a foul taste and smell to it. I saw the meat, but didn't get it because they looked like they had been sitting there for a good while. I was going to try granola with yogurt, but it had a film on the yogurt as if it had been sitting there for a VERY LONG TIME. My first round barely filled the plate because nothing looked really fresh. I am not a picky eater or a harsh food critic, but I am not going to eat something that looks like it had been sitting there from last night. The tomato salad looked like it had been sitting there for a good while, too. Management is obviously the problem and ARIA NEEDS TO TAKE NOTE OF THIS! WHAT IS THIS PLACE TRYING TO DO? GIVE US FOOD POISONING??? C'mon!!! If your buffet selection is not great, at least make sure that your food is fresh. I was at the curry section yesterday and they didnt even bother to empty out the old curry. Instead, they just threw more fresh ones on top. The old ones on the bottom will only turn bad, it's not going to make it more fresh with the fresh ones on top. The only best section of the buffet was the dessert section. Even though options were not many, at least they looked decently fresh.",

    "text": "For another city this restaurant might get a higher rating, but compared to other buffets in Las Vegas, the Buffet at the Aria doesn't match up. Especially compared to the Bellagio next door that has the same price for lunch and dinner, the Bellagio wins without doubt.  The main reason I went was for the oysters on the half shell, but beware: the oysters were unfresh, dessicated,  and had such a strong fishy taste that I was unable to swallow them. Also they looked as if no one had touched them on the ice which made them the more unfresh. The sushi was palatable though I suspect the Aria does not hire a real sashimi chef with the sashimi being unevenly cut.   The prime rib and the flank steak were good, although they were not seasoned particularly well to meet the standard already set by the Bellagio. As the newcomer on the block, the Aria does not make a case for itself; the Bellagio does a better job and has much more selection for the same cost. The Aria buffet resembles a cafeteria and the interior is somewhat claustrophobic.  The saving grace of this buffet is the beautiful presentation of its desserts, this could make it worth it if you are a dessert fan, although the selection is definitely less varied than that at the Bellagio.   All in all, the Aria was digestible (apart from the oysters), but it cannot compete in the competitive buffet scene of Las Vegas.",

I walked into the buffet and it was beautiful, especially where they sat us facing the pool and garden area. The silverware, glasses and the dessert plate where those of a gourmet restaurant. The shrimp where excellent and the crab legs where just ok. I got there for lunch at 3.30 and dinner started at 4.00, so i took my time to see what new food they would put out. The only thing that changed were the crab legs went from snow crab to king crab. The snow crab were much tastier as the king crab legs were very small and dried out. As i searched for food they had nothing much to choose from.The salad bar was very limited but the desserts were very nice. The service was very good. Lunch was 20.00 and if your into eating alot of real good firm shrimp it's worth it, but i will never return.",

I'm a red wine snob, so tried both red and white and opted for the Chardonnay, as the Malbec served was weaker in flavor. The lobster came quickly was served hot, tender and moist. The salads were fantastic... watermelon with jicama, tomatoes with figs, marinated mushrooms with garlic & peppers, and a medley of olives, cornichons, garlic & rosemary. Nice sushi selection for apps, but basic rolls, nothing unusual. Massive amts of crab legs with fresh lemon and drawn butter. The Asian green bean and beef entree was seasoned well and veggies crisp and flavorful. The lobster ravioli was delicious and very  gourmet. The tandoori chicken, naan and curry were great! The roasted veggies had pitty-pans (baby squash) which are pretty pricey at the market.The lamb was overcooked for my taste and difficult to get a rare slice. All in all very well done with minimal disappointments. Not  a huge selection for dessert, but all we tried was light and tasty. Service was ok... seemed understaffed for as pricey as it is! Nice fresh and light decor and very clean. Not your standard buffet fare, so important to go with an open mind willingness to try! I would definitely go again!",

It was \"gourmet dinner\" night which was $38.99 so my friend I decided to go back downstairs and gamble a little and come right before they did their lunch-dinner swap(lunch=19.99).  Upon entering you see the seafood selection and got giddy. it loooked Amazing: oysters, raw clams HUGE shrimp(wynn doesn't even serve shrimp at lunch anymore) crablegs etc.  Walked around and saw prime rib,   Leg of lamb and all tht good stuff. I figured heck, this is just the normal lunch, I should wait till they change it up for gourmet dinner. So from 3:45-4:30 I made a huge mistake, selfish I guess.. I only had me a plate of seafood thinking by the time I was done everything woul be swapped. So while I waited I realized that everyhing here only looks nice, and looks can be decieving. The oysters and clams were unfresh and had that very unpleasant seafood taste, the sashimi was sliced paper thin( unlike bellagio generous portions). Things started to go downhill from there. I got up to get a slice of prime rib and wth! They took it away and replaced it with 2 turkeys, the leg of lamb was gone and replaced by skirt steak. Reallly really overcooked and tough skirt steak. ( even though he said he was giving me the more rare piece).  I walked around the buffet to see what else had changed from normal lunch to \" gourmet dinner\" and was suprised to see that everything pretty much stayed the same. I need to stop my rant now, i'm still at Aria but figured i should do my yelping duties and warn others of this overyhyped, overpriced buffet. I mean, $19.99 isn't bad but don't spend almost $40 for dinner. you're pretty much getting the same food you would have gotten at MGM at double the price :( if you want buffet  go to Wynn or Bellagio. Or you can get yourself a pretty decent dinner at a nice restaurant elsewhere.",

We had to wait in line for 75 minutes and the restaurant was only 3/4 full with some sections closed off at 3:30 pm.  I noticed that our waitress had to cover 2 big sections and she's not even fit physically (250 lbs +).  I'm nothing against overweight waitresses but she moved really slow and didn't even notice that our glasses were empty for half an hour or so.  Moving on to the food, the only thing worth eating is their brisket and rack of lamb.  Their prime rib is too dry and the king crab is nothing special.  I don't care about the Indian and Mexican food because they're so cheap to eat elsewhere.  This is probably the worst $33 we've spent on any buffet.  If you're thinking about trying this buffet, please don't waste your money.  Just go to Wynn buffet for LUNCH and you'll be glad you listen to me.  Finally, we went to Wynn for lunch the next day and their lunch was way bigger than Aria dinner buffet at only $25.   Wynn had more cheeses than just 3 cheap selection of cheeses at Aria.  Wynn had parmegiano reggiano cheeses (expensive), more gourmet salad selections, more italian station, better sushi and way better dessert and gelato.  Even our kids didn't like Aria gelatos.  Their selection is poor and taste awkward.  If you go to Wynn, don't forget to try their bread pudding with anglaise sauce next to it...it's the best I've ever had.  Their gelato taste like real gelato and not some cheap ice cream.  I'm glad we came back to Wynn and after so many years trying Wynn, it never disappoint us.  I will never come back to Aria, for less money I'd rather eat at Paris Buffet who has better prime rib.",

Very good table service: beverage were kept filled and dishes removed from the table very promptly. A few floor spills were quickly cleaned up. Dinner selections were varied, definitely upscale, looked good, and tasted good. They had an especially large seafood area and plenty of steamed clams. The prime rib, a critical item in my judgment of a buffet, was excellent. As with many strip buffets, there's a strong emphasis on international foods and seafood. Overall, I was impressed with dinner. Prices are competitive with other \"high end\" strip buffets and I consider it among the better strip buffets for dinner. Unfortunately, MGM's absurd, new parking charges void my return here in the future.",

The food was excellent!  Usually at buffets the seafood (especially crab legs) are dry but this was great!  You have to take into consideration at a buffet you're paying for at least 3 meals, dessert & multiple drinks per person so $50 + tip is great!  They had a great selection (however personal preference, I wish there was more Indian food). The carrot cake pancakes were awesome!  I've been to multiple buffets in town & would 100% recommend Aria!",

Service- attentive waitresses  Food- a lot of breakfast type foods like make your own omelette, 6 types of sausages, eggs, waffles, toasts, benedicts,  etc.  There was this beef and cheese with tortillas that was pretty good and there was long crab legs that was yummy too. The sushi roll was was actually pretty good, but the sashimi didn't look fresh. There was also a Asian food section that had broccoli/ cauliflower mix, stir fried assorted veggies, kung pow beef. I really liked their pizza section especially  the cheese pizza, pepperoni pizza, and veggie pizza. I didn't like the ham one because it was dry. They had a lot of nice looking desserts, but only the raspberry cheesecake stood out. The gelatos were kind of watered down.  Bill- $51 per person with no champagne  The whole restaurant was rumbling and we thought it was earthquake, but it was just the train that links the hotels together. I wouldn't mind eating here again.",

Buffet options were great- I especially loved the garlic naan and the chow fun.

I came here on Dec. 26th for Lunch ($30 per person).  The Buffet is on the second floor.  It was quiet difficult to find .. only because I wasn't aware that it was on the second floor.    The line for The Buffet was long; however, luckily my family of 17 had VIP access to the buffet.  To get seated for 17 individuals appeared very difficult, especially for one hostess.  We even told them that splitting the group would be fine with us.  The Food was good.  I especially loved the burrito!.  There was variety, especially in the Chinese food and Meat!.  The Shrimp and the Shu Mai is so FRESH! I really liked the food, but they lacked Pasta and did not have a large selection of sushi.  However, the dessert selection was amazing!! There was a large selection of pastries, ice cream, and cakes!  The Coconut Ice cream is A MUST to eat!  The service was good, except one hostess that was really rude.  So -1 star for her.  While we were getting seated, they placed our group to the side.  Throughout the whole time she was complaining to all the other hostess right in front of us saying, \"They are not suppose to be here\", \"We should never do a group of 17\", \"What are they doing...\", etc. as she rolled her eyes at us.  There were so many tables, that we honestly could not understand what the problem was.  However, one member in our group had a talk with her, in which she instantly started to treat us well.  High corporate power for the hotel can instantly change a person's service.     Overall, the food was good.. but for a new hotel .. I expected better.",

    "text": "While in Vegas, you have a finite number of meals to enjoy. This is one I wish I had back.   I heard good things about the nearby Bellagii buffet, but there was an hour wait. I decided to take the tram to the beautiful new Aria to check out the buffet. The fact that there was no wait with a half empty restaurant should have been a warning sign.  The only thing about this meal that alluded to the fact that I was in a fine hotel was the unnecessarily heavy silverware and glass stemware for the water. After that, everything else was largely unimpressive. From the food to service, this could be a run of the mill buffet anywhere. It certainly does not fit the image that Aria is trying to convey.   King crab legs - how could you go wrong? They were chilled and had an unappealing smell to them. The shrimp were set in a glass with what looked to be cocktail sauce, but it only tasted like ketchup. The buffet is long but rather boring.   I'm chewing through valuable phone battery with this review, but if it keeps someone from spending $40 on a boring, sub par buffet, it's worth it.   This has to be up there with one of most disappointing Vegas meals.   Even if this meal had been comped, I would have still felt ripped off.   Had it been reasonably priced for what it is, it may have received two stars. I've had other mediocre buffets, but it was nowhere near the cost of this, hence the one star rating.   Time  to wash this sorry crab leg smell off my hands.   Never again.",

They ended up splitting us up almost across the buffet since we didn't want to pay an extra 18%. I can see maybe like the next table over or even across the section but whatever, they had their rules.   I must say that the spread was one of the biggest I've seen. They literally had food from all over the world! French, Mediterranean, Italian, Chinese, Mexican... They had a salad area with different types of leaves and tons of toppings. A seafood bar with crab legs, ceviche, and oysters. But the best part of any buffet, the desserts! And boy was it pretty! They had this ice cream wheel, yes I know let me explain! Think wheel of fortune but with flavors. Pick your flavor and the lady scooping will spin the wheel until it comes to your ice cream. They also had mini cupcakes, whoppie pies, cake pops, and the regular stuff like cakes and cookies.   I wouldnt say that the food was out of this world. Frankly a lot of it just tasted like mass produced buffet food would. But the variety, cleanliness, and pleasant drink staff makes me want to come back.   Two adult dinners came out to be about $85. If you want to add bottomless beer its and extra $12.",

Maybe the creme brulee, but their dessert selection was horrible. No macarons.. For $35, no macarons? Really? Bread pudding looked dry, I heard the gelato was no good.   Initially they had nigiri in their sushi section, but when I went for seconds, they only had California rolls and other cheap rolls. Their prime rib was good. They had naan and vegetable masala; both were good, but I can eat that stuff at an Indian buffet for like 8 bucks. Didn't have much variety at the Mexican, Italian, or Asian stations.   I was really excited to try this buffet since it's at one of the top hotels/casino in Vegas, but I was very let down. Also, their service is horrible. I never once got a refill on my ice tea, couldn't even find the waitress to ask.  Oh, we also had a huge party like at least 40 people or so. So the person organizing it had spoken to them previously and we had a reservation for 6pm and they would only give us 2 hours to eat and charged us 20% gratuity. Then they totally forgot about the reservation, so the whole crowd of us just stood outside for a good 30 minutes for them to clear up tables for us. Um, thanks. And 20% gratuity? It's a buffet!  15% or 18%, I can understand. And as I've mentioned before, their service sucked.   Not impressed at all. M resort and Wynn are way better. I haven't been to the Belagio in awhile, so I can't compare that.   Go elsewhere, it's really not worth $35.",

PROS: +Better quality prime rib than most buffets that advertise \"Prime Rib\".   +Pretty good King Crab (not the twice frozen junk at Bellagio where you are biting into a king crab popsicle)  +Fresh salmon nigiri (rice under it was cold and hard so I had no problem turning it into sashimi)  +Excellent coffee  +Good service  CONS:  -Some items they just didn't rotate out. Not that I'd eat pizza at a \"higher-end\" buffet but having the same pizza with the cold hard cheese sitting there for almost 2 hours didn't present well (The pizza at Bachannal buffet is REALLY good, however).  -Desserts.  From the small selection that they had, it seemed like anything that looked good was made in a way to appeal to a small amount of people. Either \"Gluten Free\" or \"Sugar Free\"...but I just want it to taste good...that's why I came here in the first place...don't need sweetener substitutes that make this thing less than it could be.   Also, I'm tired of buffets putting out cupcakes to fill an entire area of the desert section ( I'm looking at you, Planet Hollywood!). I love cupcakes, but if you've ever had a buffet cupcake, you'll know it wasn't made that day or even the day before. It's not moist and it's just a mistake to put on your plate. Well, the whole top row here was cupcakes.   The ice cream \"wheel of flavors\" didn't come near to the quality they have at Bachannal which is really top notch...another dessert disappointment.   On the other hand the croissants were good as were the macaroons.  Overall I'd come back and pay $23 (lunch) for dinner food. Prime rib and king crab, you can't go wrong.",

Selection is minimal and not up to par with what the Aria seems to be attempting for quality. The only other buffet we ate in Vegas was at the Bellagio and that really did it in for the Aria. I do have to say the staff and servers were all very friendly, just so disappointed with the quality and standard and even minimal buffet selection.",

    "text": "I'm really quite picky, someone who doesn't mind paying for great food, and generally not a fan of buffets as quantity usually trumps quality. I am also not the type of person that can eat enough to make the price of a buffet worth while.  Despite this, my husband and I ate at the Aria buffet when we stayed with them a few years ago and it has been the only time I've felt like the food was worth the price of admission, so to speak. I returned to the Aria again, in fact I'm still here, and I visited the buffet again today for lunch around 2pm (they close for lunch at 3pm although they were still seating people around that time). I do not know why it has such a low rating, but I can only assume that the negative comments are the result of circumstances that are the exception rather than the rule.   The restaurant is very clean, the rest rooms were also clean. If you eat here when there's a 1/2 hour wait or more, I'm sure you will find things a bit less put together simply because of volume and the nature of a buffet. Our server, whose name I regretfully forget, was wonderful and attentive even at the end of her shift.  She even offered to make me a cherry coke and it was perfect.  Everything was available, it was all fresh and tasted quite good. Crab legs were refilled often and continued to be filled until we left around 3pm even though they are supposed to be turning over for dinner. The fresh fruit is also great quality and delicious right now. They continue to have a nice selection of deserts and the creme brulee was good, perhaps not quite as delicate as a gourmet pastry chef might prepare it but the flavor was lovely.  No, they do not have the biggest selection I've ever seen, but bigger selections don't necessarily mean better. There's something for everyone here and I know I'd rather have them focus on quality over quantity.    Prices vary depending on time of day (breakfast/lunch vs dinner) and day of the week (mon-thurs vs fri-sun).  The best price available will be for breakfast/lunch mon-thurs, but you can earn 2 for 1 buffet vouchers by playing MGM's My Vegas apps and earning loyalty points towards rewards such as this one. You can also redeem these points for a single free buffet. So, I heartily recommend this buffet and I look forward to going back for dinner before we leave.",

    "text": "Yelp 100 Challenge 14' * 11/100  I'll go down on an avalanche with this one and say that seafood and exotic food - mediteranean & indian - lovers, you will love this place. Baba Ghanoush, lamb curry, king crab legs, mussels, clams etc. are scattered along the recently renovated buffet area and you have the whole left portion of the aisle for dessert. This is where I come in.  Over the years, I've trained myself two disciplines at the buffet 1) eat a small portion of everything 2) get cookies and flan for appetizers, salad for first main course and the carbs for second main! I mean it's not all the time we go to a buffet so number 2 happens more often than I'd want it to. What I'm trying to say is, you do not want to miss out on dessert at the strip buffets, aria is no exception.  On top of getting fancy with the food names, aria offers a good round of high quality sweets for comparatively less than what you'd pay for it you got them individually outside. I wasn't too crazy about the salads though, and the fact that there was a lonely toaster by the bread area.  Mommy thought it was an artistic touch - take it from someone who loves being in the kitchen. Papa stuck to getting some crab legs in every round. I got cookies for appetizers, he got crabs. We're almost always this way.   Thankfully, I'm bent on keeping my cookie cravings to 2013. Next trip here, I may actually try the salad. Mmm actually, let me give this place a 3.6, pretty much because I kept wishing they had more variety of sushi - maybe salmon, sweet egg etc. Next one to try is the Paris buffet but that's probably set for later this year.",

The two things that are worth mentioning are their crab legs and their breakfast pancakes. Their crab legs are served hot and very fresh. I love the Buffet at Aria.",

Some of the food wasn't stellar, but some really was outstanding. I found the best tandoori chicken ever, fresh from the oven, moist and flavorful. Fresh, chewy naan was an unusual thing to see on a buffet and very welcome. Great prime rib and au jus. Great seafood. Soooo many choices!   Lovely desserts; we found the less spectacular-looking things tasted better than many of the beautifully composed desserts. I loved the gelato.

    "text": "When I first walked in, I had to wait a few minutes to sit down. I'm sure it was not because it was full but because the lack of efficiency of the staff set up. They either didn't have enough hosts or they don't have a good system.  The place is very nice, I love the atmosphere and the low tones lighting blends really well with the natural light coming in from the windows, obviously this was in the day time, I came at 9AM to get some breakfast.   Host was nice and greeted me with a smile, and she asked how I was doing and seemed pretty sincere when she asked me. She sat me at the table and just told me that I can go ahead and help myself, which makes sense... its a buffet.  As soon as I go to the main area looking for eggs, I asked one of the cooks that serve food in the islands, where I could find the eggs and seemed a little bothered that I asked him.  He did tell me that if I wanted an omelette it was in one direction but if I wanted just eggs hey were in the opposite direction. But he said it in a way like if I was supposed to know.  I got my food and sat at the table. The server came asking if I needed anything and she was very nice and smiling all the time. She actually made up for the cool that made me feel bad for asking where the food was at.  She looked stressed out but regardless she managed to keep a smile. Her name is Alicia. Kudos to her.  Now let's talk about the food, the meat and potatoes of a restaurant.  First of all I'm pretty health conscious and always want to make sure to ask a fee questions about he food.  So I grabbed a bowl of oatmeal, I added raisins and a banana to slice it up and put it in my oatmeal along with eggs.  First if all, I'm sure the eggs were not cracked there, it was probably egg batter, they didn't look like fresh cracked eggs at all. I asked the waitress if they had coconut or almond milk which they didn't. I don't like to consume too many dairy products, and specially cow milk.  Then I asked if the orange juice they had was fresh squeezed and she said that it was all from concentrate.   So as far as the quality of the food, it was about a 3 star. Of course I only had a small sample of the variety if food thy have available, but just by those 2 things I already know that the quality of food is not in the top of their priority list.  So here's what I say about my first visit here:  Atmosphere - 5 Stars Staff Service - 4 Stars Food Quality - 3 Stars Variety of Food - 4 1/2 stars.",

Overall, the food quality was pretty good, but for the price ($23-$28), it is a bit pricey.  The staff was pretty decent - the waiters were pretty prompt with refilling your drinks. The dining room looks out to the pool. Depending on who's swimming out there, could be a nice view, or it could cause you to lose your appetite. ;)",

    "text": "For awhile now I have been combing through all of the reviews on here about the Aria buffet and a I finally decided on my next trip to Vegas regardless of all the mediocre and negative reviews,  I would give them a chance.  I am a huge advocate for good customer service and I had read several reviews on here that rated this buffet poor in customer service.  I told the person I had the buffet with to keep in mind that this place is not known for their customer service so don't expect much.  I highly recommend giving this buffet a try. Our server was oustanding.. Her name is Catalina.  She greeted us with a smile, brought drinks and refills very quickly.  She cleared down our dirty plates in a timely fashion. She offered coffee at the end of the meal. She gave top notch service from beginning to end.         Now for the food review,  we came specifically to eat breakfast since the place we regularly used to enjoy breakfast,  the M resort,  no longer serves breakfast as a buffet. The food was great.  They offer bacon like all places, but also turkey bacon which you don't usually see.  What I had, I enjoyed.  I had an egg white omelet with mushrooms and cheese, bacon, hash browns and some French Toast sticks. By the time I finished my plate, the buffet turned over for lunch.  They had a lot of appetizing dishes. I look forward to my next visit.",

    "text": "Buffets can be horrifying, but this one kind of categorized itself to limit inundating the senses.  At 23.95, it is probably a bargain because of the seafood appetizers, which are featured first.   You can't be shy here.  There was a mountain of crab legs, but I did my best to pry out my own hill, and get to work with the drawn butter, and jumbo shrimp.  Good thing, because this was seriously the best part of the meal.  There was a spinach salad to accompany the crab, which I followed with a good chicken curry and garlic naan.  My carnivorous boyfriend did serious damage with a slab of prime rib, and had creamed spinach as a side dish.  Pizzas, mexican food, and Chinese food were also features, which could be good for kids. I did enjoy the miniature salads in shot glasses, tomato and mozerella, and greens.  They were a great variation on the usual.  The tiny deserts were also appreciated, since we could try several, and enjoyed the creme brulee.  Cookies rounded off the meal. The ambience needs tuning.  I appreciate mid-century modern, and while it is sophisticated modern minimalism in the shopping, and casino areas of Aria, it does take on a done to death cafeteria patina in the buffet. All-in-all, worth the money, but not memorable.",

Although the place is very clean and there are a lot of stations, it just did not impress me.  Things are not really labeled well (off the actual spot or not labeled at all) and some of the offerings are less than spectacular (dry white rice with crappy soy - not Kikkoman, lackluster breakfast pastries).  Our server was super nice and entertained my need for many beverages, but I just didn't feel like this lived-up to the $19 price tag for me.  There were some Mexican and Mediterranean offerings that also seemed really odd for 7 in the morning (curried cauliflower? full chips and salsa bar?)  I ended up just eating a bunch of the Asian stuff (shrimp dumplings, potstickrets, fried rice, noodles, rice)  and calling it a day.  I really had hoped they would have had miso soup on that table or more than like 3 dry cereals .  Where is the shrimp and grits or biscuits and gravy??  Why don't you put a juice bar out and get rid of all the salad - this was not brunch time or a weekend, but they acted like it was.  Skip this and head for a real breakfast or spring for the Bacchanal at Bellagio.",

Nice atmosphere, very open and well arranged room. Service except for one time was very good. Done plates were taken promptly and drinks were refilled before they could get empty. There is a tandoori oven and the desserts are from the Jean Phillippe Patisserie(sp?) in Aria. Food for the most part is well above average.

    "text": "I'm not sure I agree with John H's logic.  He moved it all the way down to 1 star because of badly made sushi rice?  Out of the 30 or whatever courses they served, 1 hard rice ball and he freaks out...  I'd have to say that's a bit harsh.    Anyway, I was quite happy about the food here, having eaten buffets the day before too (seems like a vegas ritual for me).  I had the Wynn buffet before, and it was almost 10 bucks more and didn't have the king crab legs with less selection (slightly, and lunch).    My visit was for lunch on the weekend, and it wasn't too crowded, but it was full.  The wait wasn't too bad though.  They have it all, or most of what I would want in a buffet.  King crab legs (no snow crab!), coctail shrimp (I think it's only half cooked for max crispness, and when I told my coworker he said it's ceviche style but it was still coctail shrimp), prime rib was very tender and you can choose between well done or med rare.  I tried the lamb too but the guy sliced a end cut for me and I hate well done meats (except for pork of course).  The tomato bisque was good, the chinese congee was very tasty, even the apple crepe was good.  The dessert is awesome because they are all served on individual plates, and taste pretty decent.  The icecream was great though.  It was very creamy and tasty.    It was I think 24 a person on a weekend, so the price was excellent for what you get, and the server was very friendly.  I think the decor is ok, as the bankers really started to save money on the decorations, but it wasn't terrible.  But you can see cheap touches if you look closely.    My only complaint was it was missing lobster, but I guess you get that for dinner, and you pay more too.  But that's nitpicking.  It's pretty good for what you pay for in a buffet.  After this it feels like the 40 dollar (or 30 dollar for lunch) ones are really overcharging people.",

My mister's iPhone had run out of juice, so I didn't know what rating this place was getting...so I tried it without and bias.  They were serving brunch and the price wasn't too bad, $23, but you can add $5 for bottomless champagne/mimosa...of course I added the bubbly.  The place was spacious and well lit since it had huge windows with views of the pool area.  They had a lot of food choices, but I always judge the buffet based on the seafood selection.  Here's the breakdown:  GOOD:  -touch screen menus in the front (cool factor) -king crab legs (which you can request them to steam them for you...a must!)  -oysters -shrimps (cocktail style and chinese style (fried with skin on) -lamb chops -gelato -macarons -strawberries (sweet just like it was freshly picked from the Oxnard farm)  OKAY -prime rib was decent, nothing to die for -champagne was ok, didn't really pair well with the OJ, or maybe the OJ wasn't freshly squeezed.  -crepes, eggs benedict, omelette station  UGLY -Although our waitress was nice, she was slow to come around to get our drink order and get check on us. -Sauces were located in wierd spots, gravy was next to the asian food. -limited sushi selection  Overall, the buffet wasn't bad for the price, but I've had better.",

Salad bar great, mozzarella balls, sun dried tomates, marinated bell peppers, salami, cheeses, pizzas, great lasagna, sauteed mushrooms, tandoori chicken, lamb curry, the carvings section, great sweet brisket, perfectly seasoned prime rib, Portuguese sausage, thai fusion tapas style dishes, anchovies salad, scallop salad, steamed mussels and clams, crawfish, shrimp, steamed crabs legs not the cold frozen shit some buffets serve.

My overall opinion for the variety of food offered was hopeful at first, but disappointed as I walked around to scope things out. It does have your customary dessert area, asian area, mexican area, salad area, a tandoor area, and carving area. At one point I saw Area 51, but that was the only thing out of this world here unfortunately!  The food itself missed many marks as it was to the point where I only had 1 plate and refused to go back for anything further..I tried a vegetable egg roll, pineapple sausage,  and orange chicken from the Asian station. I did find the egg roll to be cooked quite well and not too crispy like it was swimming in a day pool of grease. The orange chicken was hit or miss piece to piece. I had some that were soft and flavorful and a majority that well were more geared towards being a jawbreaker than a delight of the orient.  My highlight of the meal was the prime rib from the carving station, but that didn't totally \"meat\" the mark (pardon the pun)..The gentleman who manned the station was very pleasant and did seem to take to me being respectful as a rarity which made me wonder how people are normally..I give kudos to him and certainly people deserve to be treated as equals..THAT could be a whole other review in itself..The prime rib itself was very tender, BUT it did lack quite a bit of flavor..I drenched it in au jus, but still some bold flavor would've been appreciated  Another notable was the peel and eat shrimp and steamed snow crab..The shrimp itself was a high point and I did enjoy that the crab was cut in half so that you could just essentially skin the crab for the meat vs. getting carpal tunnel cracking all day..I probably could've eaten much more of that and from looking around it did seem like these were a crowd pleaser of patrons above anything else.  I have to say in closing this was a let down for me as there are clearly better and well accepted buffets in Vegas (seems like a dying breed of what once was), but I really hope that Aria takes notice and conducts a serious revamp of things in the near future..The staff was warm and inviting which is a saving grace, but an empty dining room during the pre Zarkana hours does kind of paint a very disturbing picture right?",

We noticed that service was quite slow because there were a lot of empty tables but it was taking forever for people to get seated. The ladies at the front desk kept calling customers up to pay when the line to be seated was already extra long. it took us about 20 minutes to get to the pay desk, then about another 25 to get a table. the girl who was looking for a table for our party was disgustingly rude. She clearly did not like her job. She kept giving customers attitude, was very snappy, and kept rolling her eyes. Once we were finally seated, we went to get our food and the selection is not that great. I must say though that if you like seafood, i'm sure you'll like it - but if you're looking for a wide selection of food - do not come here.  no one ever came to give us re-fills and no one came to clear our plates. it was a pig pen on our table.   never coming back to this buffet again.",

Chinese food was bad,  seafood was ok,  meat station was good as were the desserts.  Three stars all the way.    Brunch was better.  Busier so the food seemed fresher with the quicker turnover.  Coffee was good and pastries were as well. Meat station was good again.  I'd say  3-1/2 stars for brunch.  Overall not the best buffet.  Both caesars and wynn are better,  but if you are staying at Aria,  it would be a decent choice for breakfast or Brunch.",

They had so many great stations -- Asian, Indian, Seafood, Mediterranean, Meat Carving, Desserts, etc.  The meat station was amazing -- I was so impressed that the prime rib had a perfect medium rare on it, the leg of lamb was nice and tender with a great mint flavor, the dim sums were steamed perfectly, the snow crab and king crab was delicious, and even the sushi was amazing!  And the desserts -- omg the desserts were so amazing.  They even have gelato that they were hand scooping that was AMAZING.  And they have $12.99 all you can drink (beers, wines, champagnes, etc.)!  Cannot wait to come back here again for SURE!",

I'm a vegetarian with smarter intentions, only went here because my family wanted to go. One of the worst things about this buffet is the temperature of the food that no one is monitoring. The Pho was lukewarm according to my brother and probably not vegetarian due to beefstock or something similar. No vegetarian sushi here, in fact not much to eat at all if you are vegetarian. The food wasn't very fresh, probably a lot of leftovers from the previous day(s).   One positive thing is they did have 5 different types of hummus. That's not something you see every day.",

    "text": "On a whim, I searched for \"gluten-free Vegas buffet\" and found only one with great reviews -- this one. So I made a beeline there while at Bally's for a conference. Lucky for me, I ran into a concierge who was waiting for a chef to show someone around who had celiac. I wound up getting a full tour of the buffet and learned what was safe to eat -- which was a surprising amount. Things I would not have thought of were made gluten-free, like corn fritters and tiramisu (made with a combination of almond and tapioca flour -- I need to learn how to make this!!!).   The pho station also worked when you chose veggie miso broth and soba (buckwheat noodles). They also have gluten-free pizza and pasta cooked to order if you want, but I overstuffed myself on crab legs, tacos, veggies, carving station meats, pho, and lots of tiramisu :)  My server was very nice and as soon as some wayward crab fell off my plate (no cracking utensils readily available, so it was bound to happen), someone stopped by to clean it up. I think it helped that I was in town just before March Madness and St. Patrick's Day, so not as many people around Vegas in general. Made for a more sane experience.  The only thing that tasted off were the fish tacos -- seems like they had been sitting around for a while and tasted fishy and cold. I didn't get sick from anything I ate, however, so I was a happy camper. Props to the chef for thinking of us gluten-free folks!",

We went a bit late (8 or 9PM) and had to wait in line for a short amount of time. There was a wide variety of selection from the salad bar to homestyle food to mediterranean to seafood/sushi and different asian cuisines. I loved the fried rice, sushi, salad bar and pizza. All were high quality and I didn't run into anything that was not well prepared.   Saturday morning we came back for brunch. In addition to the food, we also ordered the 12.99 bottomless beverages. Those drinks were strong and the waitress made sure to keep our glass full!! The salad bar, pizza and asian dishes/sea food remained but most of the other stations from the night before had been replaces with more \"breakfast style\" food. There were traditional items like pancakes and french toasts and also some more ethnic cuisines as well. As with dinner, all of the items were well prepared and tasted well.   I would return to the Aria buffet.",

At that price, you kind of feel like you really have to eat a ton to get your money's worth.   I will say the seafood selection was abundant, including both King and snow crab legs, several types of fish and shellfish, and dishes like pallella.   Everything I tried was very good, and our server, Louis, worked harder than I've ever seen a buffet server work.   At $50 a person, I might try a few other places before coming back - but if we were in the mood for seafood, we'd probably come back here.   Tip: if you're seeing the show at Aria, it's literally immediately next door so it's very convenient to eat here before a show.",

Having been here before, I went straight to the \"fish market\" section - snow crab legs, cold king crab legs, black mussels & even New Zealand ones, clams, jumbo stone crab claws, etc. Definitely my favorite section.   Other areas of this buffet include Latin, carvery, sweets, tandoor, thai/Chinese (which served dim sum), and salad station.   The service was on par as well. Our drinks were never left completely empty, and our plates were picked up without any hesitation.   The other station that I LOVED was the dessert station. There were endless opportunities there. I kind of went back & forth between food & dessert...just cause why the hell not?   Among the guests, I could tell that the seafood station was a favorite...but there are so many options, you really can't go wrong with this place. Soup? Salad? Provolone Cheese with Bread? Mussels Diablo? Clams with creamy lemon sauce? Chana Masala with ACTUAL naan made in a tandoor? 15+ types of ice cream & gelato? Classic corn on the cob & a carving station?   ...how much more can I question before I find myself back in this establishment? I guess we will have to find out ;)",

    "text": "Disappointing, lacking and a miss for the Aria. let me start with the Chinese new year celebration going on they swapped a portion of the buffer to accomodated traditional chinese dishes and belive me seen the fried chicken feet doesnt add to the atmosphere. in general disappointment was due to the lack of unique items, the buffer is very standard something that you would see in any small time hotel buffet.  The seafood waerent fresh and very chewy meaning they sat there for a long time and most likely was cooked froozen (which is a kill for mussles and clams). The only bright light and star was the meat station, the cownoy steak was done very well and so were the sausages. service was very good, kind and fast. they are priced ok i guess $40 for a buffet is standard but they have to raise the bar...",

The curse is, then we end up blowing dolla dolla bills & creating these ridiculous lists like, \"try all the buffets on the strip\" or \"must cross out every day club before we're too old and saggy to be out day clubbing.\"  So now to my predicament. Yes, i saw the 3 yelp star warning practically on its knees pulling me away from entering the Aria buffet line. But our friend wanted crab legs and we were staying next door at Vdara.  See that? Convenience won.   Never. Will. I. Ever. Not. Listen. To. Fellow. Yelpers. Again.  Food was beyond saving. If Chef Ramsay saw this, he would've said it's so bad, insects prefer to starve.   That's all I got left to say.",

Aside from that, I liked the buffet at the ARIA because it wasn't your \"over the top, super decadent, 100 desserts and counting, let's eat here for 5 hours so we can try everything\" buffet.  It is a decent sized buffet, with enough variety that you don't get overwhelmed, coffee is good, and it's not super expensive. It wasn't cheap, but it wasn't like 50 dollars a person either.  The only thing I didn't like was that the line was really long and took forever to move. But, I guess that just makes people more hungry.",

The few pieces we did get tasted funky so we went for the shrimp which also tasted funky. Most of the meat was dry or over salted. The only saving Grace was the lamb. Anything with lamb was good.

We came during the end of brunch, around 2:50 so we paid the brunch price but also got dinner as well! The carving station is amazing. The potbelly alone I could have devoured all day long. The crab legs are a must. Even down to the desserts, everything was presented well. It's perfect for the price. Not too expensive at all especially for what you get. The small portions are perfect, allowing you to try a little of everything. Of course some foods you're going to like over others, but all in all, i'd give it a 5!",

I had iced tea and it was good quality.   The food, sadly, did not live up to my expectations. This isn't exactly the cheapest buffet so I expect pretty tasty food.   The two best things here were the ribs and the quinoa salad. Everything else was pretty bland. The salmon dishes were dry and the poke station had mostly tasteless fish and fixings.   Most of the food here is very heavy. Lots of heavy cream and butter and I don't really like that in ALL my dishes.   The dessert was subpar as well. The creme brulee had \"burnt sugar\" that was soft and not hard like it's supposed to be. The ice cream looked tempting but was mostly flavorless as well.   I really don't recommend this buffet. We went to the buffet at Bellagio the next day and had much better food. This rating would be lower if it wasn't for our awesome waitress.",

The food had some pretty good flavors, but there were some things that were lacking- like the brisket.  Deserts were a weak spot, but still better than what we'd experienced at another buffet earlier. We had a BOGO for the dinner, so it was affordable for us, but I can't promise I'd come back if we didn't have a deal.

OMG, they had two kinds of chow mein!  Why???  Fried rice so dry, a gailan veg dish and some assortment of dimsum.  No meat selection.   A big disappointment.  I didn't finish eating what I had that I went to their Fish Market station to get the Poke bowl.  I stood there waiting for a good 5-7 minutes for help.  Two guys inside were too busy talking and finally asked what I wanted.  Told him the tuna/salmon poke bowl.  Poor customer service they were too busy chatting and laughing inside their station.  Also I went around to get grilled veg, I asked for asparagus and lady handed me two stalks, I asked for two more extra asparagus.  She gave me the eye!!!!  Why?   I thought I'm at a buffet, why are the servers at almost all stationed had an attitude?   On the other hand, our waiter was nice and lively always checking if we need mOre drink.

    "text": "Vegas is known for their buffets and the selections they have, and this was the first time trying the ARIA buffet. Definite pros and cons to it.  [[HOW TO GET MORE FOR YOUR MONEY? 1. Get the Bottomless Beverage Pass (unlimited alcoholic beverages) using the MyVEGAS app which is free to download and available on Apple or Android devices, go 1 hour before Lunch, so you can get two buffets in one (Breakfast & Lunch!), get a refill on your final Alcoholic beverage and take it to-go!]]  The buffet is about $40 a person. The reason why I chose to eat here is because I was able to buy a Bottomless Beverage Pass (unlimited alcoholic beverages) from the MyVEGAS app! If you don't have it, download it, it will save you a lot of money, and the rewards are FREE! The bottomless beverage pass is normally $20. If I didn't get the Beverage pass I definitely would not buy one, I don't think I drank enough - 1 margarita (very sweet because it's premixed), 1 glass of wine (chardonnay or cabernet are all they offer), and 2 mimosas.  The buffet itself does have a good selection between different cuisines: Chinese, Middle East, Mexican, Japanese and American. They also had a Carvery, Salad, and Dessert section. I got fortunate and went during breakfast just before they transitioned to lunch, but I didn't really grab anything 'breakfast'. I did notice they made their waffles fresh, had a great selection of breakfast items (hash browns, eggs, eggs benedict, lox, bagels, sausage, bacon, cereal, French toast and more.)   The selection of food though is very unique and less generic which is something that I enjoyed, you can tell that there is a great selection of items, they didn't just have the basic items you'd find at a cheap buffet, which is what I liked.   Foods that I absolutely LOVED: the mashed potatoes (omg, SO GOOD), pot roast (delicious), grilled veggies (wonderful once you add a little salt), menudo (I got seconds thats how good it was), creme brulee (creamy and cool), strawberry-lime-raspberry sorbet (tangy and refreshing).   Foods that were MEH: pork belly (found at carvery station), pho (didn't like the broth and the noodles were not fresh) and sushi (huge disappointment).  Service here my group got lucky. We got whom we believed to be the best server, Mary Ann. She was friendly, bubbly and you can tell she loved her job. She came by our table plenty of times to ask how we were and also definitely was not shy about asking if we wanted more alcohol (LOL double bonus). She bussed tables like a major pro filling up a server tray to the top (bravo). There was a table next to us where they seemed to be regulars because she talked to them and genuinely seemed to care about how their visit was and how they were doing since the last time she saw them. I work as an Operations Manager in the Food & Beverage industry and my friends, two of them are Servers and one a Bartender/Server and honestly, Mary Ann amazed us all. She is an asset for sure and definitely made our trip wonderful, 5-Stars Mary Ann, you were absolutely incredible! When I come back, I definitely would ask to sit in her section because her service and hospitality was just incredibly welcoming and wonderful!",

I only went for the crab legs which they were serving three kinds of . . Alaskan king crab, Jonah's crab claws as snow crab!! This Buffet had many different options to pick from  .they even had a fresh squeezed lemonade that was amazing!! I decided to check out this buffet for the crab legs and seafood since the Rio is no longer serving crab! I will definitely return here again on my next trip",

    "text": "Sushi, and bacon, and crab legs - oh my!  I'm not the biggest breakfast person, nor do I enjoy massively produced food, so I was a little bummed when our group chose the Buffet at Aria for Sunday brunch ($40).  I'm so glad I was out numbered, because this was easily the best meal of our trip. Aria does it right with food stations featuring items from across the globe - Chinese, American, Japanese, Italian, and Mediterranean.   This buffet does not limit itself to just brunch, they go above and beyond with carving stations, omelette making stations, and loads of specialty pizzas! My favorite part? The desert bar! I even tried to stuff a few rice krispies in my pockets, but I guess that's frowned upon.   There is a server dedicated to each table, who will refill your water, coffee, and clear plates. Sadly, the $40 fee does not cover alcohol, but they did have some pretty tasty juices on the brunch menu - champagne flasks anyone?",

I lived in Vegas and worked on the strip for 5 years. I now go back back often to visit friends. I've tried just about every main Buffet on the strip. For the price, I feel you do not get near as many options as other \"high end\" buffets.   The good: if you like crab legs or some international foods, then you may be happy.  The bad: several of the desserts were hard/stale. Not a lot of options in general compared.",

Luckily, we got to try both the brunch menu and the dinner menu since it starts from 3pm-10pm and normally cost $39.99 per person. They do offer an all day buffet for $60 with unlimited access and a separate line to skip the rush.   They offer a variety of different type of dishes. It is separated by fish market, sweets, salad bar, Asian, pizza, Mediterranean, Latin, tandoori, Italian, and carvery, and diner. It has a little of everything to satisfied your food cravings (check photos). Everything we had was surprisingly good and flavorful. The best thing I liked the most and was unique is the pastrami style pork belly! We also murder their crab legs! Going back for plates after plates. They precut them so it's easier to break open and pull out the meat in one piece. The creme brulee is also a hit! We were so full at the end but wanting to eat more of it.   I just want to shootout to our waitress Susan for providing excellent service. She was very nice and friendly and made sure our dishes were taking away in a timely matter. She also checked on us periodically to refill our drinks and it was busy! We had pre-tip at the register but ended up tipping more because of her! Thank you Susan!",

I never been to this buffet before so I was excited to check it out. We came at around 1100 and they still had some breakfast stuff and slightly transitioning to lunch. The selection was a lot smaller than I expected. I like the seafood section as they were fresh. Definitely like the poke section. The brisket was also pretty good but kind of bland. My sister stated 'everything could have been better, there was just something missing in everything' and I agreed. The dessert section was kind of disappointing as well, nothing looks super appealing and it was just ok. I only like the macaroon.  Some of the signs didn't correlate with the food so that was a little annoying. Another thing that was annoying was how long it took for the naab bread to be ready. I was excited to get naan bread but they weren't even finish prepping by the time I finished so I couldn't even get to try it.  The price was ok as well.",

By the time I realized it was the wrong place I was too hungry to search for the right place which I think was in @cosmopolitan_lv. The first plate was bomb. The second plate, not so much. The pancakes tasted as good as the first but everything else was a bit dry the second time. You may think I'm being funny with this one but the water was so good.

    "text": "I was here just last weekend on a Friday.  I think this place is pretty mediocre in terms of value for the price ($45 per adult).  Some pros and cons below:  pros:  1) kids eat free so this is definitely a great value if your kids have good appetite for things like prime rib, seafood, etc. 2) the carving station has some nice cuts of prime rib, pork belly (much leaner than I expected!), turkey, roast chicken, etc. 3) asparagus and various non-spicy peppers were tasty at the carving station as well.  cons:  1) the salad bar I felt was fairly weak and did not provide a good selection of healthy options. Half the options were literally drowning in dressing so I couldn't get the portions I wanted. 2) cooked fish was almost non-existent.  There was a salmon (in hollandaise sauce?) that was provided, but it was drowning in sauce for a one bite portion of meat. 3) most of the items are provided in preset dishes.  I know this is common in Vegas buffets and some are fans, some aren't.  I prefer to portion out what I want as I don't like to waste food in case I'm not a fan of the item. 4) The cooked Chinese veggies were drowning in soy sauce so I was not interested in these.  Overall, it's OK for Vegas buffet standards, but there are far better values in LA for AYCE.  I was here for a social occasion.",

We decided to check out the buffet in Aria, since no one has ever talked about this place before (LOL).   Wait: 15 minutes max. How great! Interior: I like the clean, simple look. Definitely felt more subtle than other flashier buffets. Service: the lady who helped us was super duper...slow. No offense, but we had so much plates on our tables that we needed to clear, and she only came 2 times throughout our dining experience.   Selection: standard stuff! Meats, Asian, Indian, Italian, seafood, soups, salad, and desserts.   +1 grilled vegetables!  +1 there's a poke bar!  +1 Desserts were pretty diverse! Gelato was mediocre quality, but the smaller pastries were good.   Overall, everything I tried was average. Nothing was below expectation (besides service), but nothing stood out either.

For my palette, I wasn't left with much to choose from. I had scrambled eggs which was okay, bacon too greasy/salty, sausage okay, ham great, pork excellent and yummy. Did not like the dessert selections at all and was so disappointed. So after spending $39.59 ($30.99 plus taxes and 18% tip) I dont think I got my money's worth. I'm full mainly from drinking three glasses of orange juice, a cup of coffee and a glass of water.  I was really thirsty. Other diners look to be having a ball and partaking in a lot of the choices I didn't care about.  My server was great.",

It might be also because i was really hungry that everything tasted good but there are a few outstanding features about this place. The seafood section had customizable poke bowls. The tuna and salmon were fresh enough and they got all the popular toppings and that already drew me in. I guess shrimp is a big deal for people (based on the other reviews). I thought it was fine for lunch. The other fantastic sector they have was the carvings (meat) section. Getting fatty portion of the brisket with Texas steak while drowning it in the ad jus... (drool).  Last but not least to round everything out; the sweets. I love the creme brulee with the multiple selections of gelato.  You really don't need much else than those places; all the other selections were ok but those 3 sectors makes the place worth for lunch.",

    "text": "If you want an experienced review, then i'll be straight with you and I wont BS you, and by \"experienced\" I don't mean on Yelp, I mean in terms of my experience with multiple vegas buffets. I know you'll find a lot of reviews for this buffet saying that it was a great buffet and that it was amazing but those people have probably NOT had the buffets at Caesars (Bacchanal) or the Wynn buffet or etc. because those are far better in quality and overall food selection. The buffet here at Aria is okay. The selection of food was very underwhelming, not very many choices. The size of the buffet is fairly small as well. The seating area is pretty large but the buffet itself is kinda small. Aria is one of the newer and nicer hotel/casinos on the strip and you would expect the buffet to be superb but it's really not. The selection of sushi was very limited to like 2 or 3 kinds and I'm not even a big sushi person. The meat section was terrible. The prime rib looked almost rare, which is gross and especially at a buffet. The beef ribs were also seemingly undercooked. This buffet is less than decent. If you're in vegas then chances are that you're visiting and hitting up a buffet is almost on everyones \"to do list\". Buffets are pretty expensive and honestly just spend the extra money and go to the Bacchanal at Caesars, it's totally worth it trust me. And to top it all off, my 14 year old sister got major food poisoning after eating here. My friends came with us as well and they were both vomiting after eating there also. We only came here because the line at Caesars was too long and we figured that Aria would have a good buffet given the stature of Aria but it was very disappointing. I know that the management reads these reviews so if you're looking for ways to improve your buffet then you need to add more items that are at the other top tier buffets and teach your waiters about customer service. Our waitress walked by our table at least 3 to 4 times before coming to our table to clean up, and that was after I had to ask for her. I spent more than $200 bucks here for 4 people and it was definitely not worth it. Don't come here, pay a little more and go to Caesars.",

We got there pretty early so we were seated right away and the server was very polite.  (Btw, the server told us that Saturday afternoons are the busiest.) The are lots of food options and if you have special dietary needs, ex. Gluten-free, there are some options for you. If you get an omelet made for you at the omelet station, it will be big so you might want to share so they you have room for the other delicious food.   We are definitely coming here again!",

We returned a year later, and it was less memorable but still good. Three years on, this place has gone way downhill. We were here for the \"holiday buffet.\" Just about everything we ate was crusty, congealed, and flavorless, and the price is higher than the far superior Wynn buffet. It was clear that dishes, especially desserts, had been refrigerated and set back out. The pho broth was barely even lukewarm. Every pastry we sampled had soft, soggy crust (poor technique, storage, or not fresh), and the cake part of the carrot cake was so dry it was developing its own toast-like crust. Very poor labeling of dishes. What was labeled shrimp and grits was actually chorizo or some kind of ground meat with grits. Some dishes were unlabeled. We were very disappointed because we're staying in the City Center area, and Aria is convenient. The Thai tea and the service weren't bad. But we'll need to see an \"Under New Management\" sign before coming back.",

Probably the fixed price $37 per person (not cheap but affordable in vegas) as we got burned by an mediocre restaurant the night before @ $120+ per person.  It is basically a combination of savorless cafeteria food, calorie galore dish that satisfy no other intent than stuffing yourself as much as you can to make your $ worth it. But no it's not good. Service is below acceptable. And atmosphere is a mix of a jail cafeteria (of what In think a jail cafeteria is), a economy waiting lounge in a train station,  or a feeding troff for people with scooters",

I asked for a refill on my water about two times before finally receiving one fifteen minutes later. Food was okay, not bad at all, but not worth the price.  Desert bar was typical. Gelato, creme brulee, etc. Tasted yummy, but they have those selections in almost every buffet.  I love staying at the Aria, but I probably won't ever eat here again.

    "text": "It was Saturday morning and I was browsing the little booklet you get behind the headrest on the taxi and noticed this ad for a buffet at Aria.   It showed a picture of Alaskan King Crab and shows breakfast for $15, lunch for $20 and dinner for $28.    So we take a taxi to the hotel and by the time we get there, it was late morning.  Low and behold they charged us $25 each for BRUNCH.  We didn't think much about it until after I sat down and started eating.  I then remembered that they advertised Alaskan King Crab and that was one of the main reasons why I wanted to eat here.  When I approached the buffet line, they had SNOW CRAB LEGS-which is a anorexic, cheap version and very different.  I looked at the receipt and noticed that we not only were overcharged, but they Falsely advertised their shit.  Not only did they charge us MORE for brunch than breakfast, even lunch, but they didn't have what they advertised at all.  I approached the manager and her response was that the Alaskan King Crab is for dinner only.  Look at the ad I uploaded and you tell me if it says that.  HELL NO.  I asked her to show me where the fuck it says that the crab is \"during dinner only\".  She said, \"Oh, I'll talk to marketing about that\".  Are you freaking kidding me?  I'm not falling for that BS line.  Not only that, but why is her brunch prices higher than lunch?  She couldn't answer.  She then said, \"Well, let me check with the chefs in the back and see if we have any Alaskan King Crab.  Uh...that's great, but I'm actually DONE eating and it's more about the issue more than anything now.  She brought me a plate of the crab legs, but I wasn't into it anymore.  I didn't like how she tried to pull the sheets over my eyes and mislead me, along with all the other people that didn't bother speaking up.  As a compromise, she refunded me 1 meal ($25).  I was satisfied, but wonder how many other people caught this.    The food was good, not spectacular.  One of my favorites was the thick-cut smoked bacon.  The pre-made breakfast burrito was yummy as well.  Oh...the absolute BEST thing they had was (drum roll) the COFFEE!  OMG...it was the absolute best coffee I've ever had in Vegas.  Starbucks/Peets can't touch this stuff.  The only other time I had coffee like this was in Portland Oregon in a coffee house there.  Aria has good breakfast if you pay $15 (as advertised), but certainly not $25 they tried to scam me on.",

So if you're going to a Vegas buffet just for crab, I would come here. However they did not have a good selection of sushi, actually the sushi didn't look fresh at all and I did not eat any of it. The Asian food section served the worst pad thai I've ever eaten, and the dim sum wasn't that great either. I did like the carving station because the lamb was extremely good and they actually had mint jelly which surprised me because a lot of buffets do not serve lamb let alone provide mint jelly. But as I mentioned before if you just want to eat king crab then you should go to this buffet because it is $20 cheaper then Caesar's Palace, but if you want more variety this is not the place to go.",

They have a few different meats at the carving station. They are serving things in their own little cooking containers. Just like the Bacchanal. They even use the same tyoe of music. Yet the food quality and service isn't as good as the Bacchanal.  My wife had a bagel that was hard. Our waitress went on break so our table stopped being served. When I went to get ice cream the server gave it to me. Then remembered he was supposed to be wearing rubber gloves. It didn't replace my ice cream that he used his fingers to help serve, he just went on to the next person.   The price is not impressive either. We paid $32 each today for brunch. Yesterday we paid the same at the Bacchanal for lunch.   My recommendation,  if you don't feel like walking or waiting this buffet is fine. If you don't mind waiting or walking then go to Ceasars.",

I went on a saturday and the dinner cost like $46 after tax and tip.   The layout and design of the restaurant give it a high class vibe. The general food and quality was very similar to Bellagio with more of a focus on Indian food. They have fresh made naan which was quite delicious.  Theres the standard crab legs and shrimp, but for some reason the weekend I went it had unpeeled shrimp and the crab legs were smaller then I remembered seeing before. They also gave half a lobster to each guest after you sat down, but you were not allowed to have refills on the lobster. Lobster was very delicious.  I mainly enjoyed the carved meats. They had a lot of options such as brisket, prime rib, pork ribs, beef ribs, skirt steak, mahi mahi, etc. I of which we very good. The chinese food and sushi was okay, but not real memorable. I didnt try the pastas, they had a pasta station, but didnt use it.  The desert area is sorta hit or miss. I didnt like it, but I know others who have liked it. Its more of a crap shoot on whether or not the stuff they had was the stuff you liked. I love cheesecake and creme brulee, but they didnt really have anything like that. The cheesecake they had was not something I would consider to be a cheesecake.  I would go back again, but I think I would rather go to Bellagio buffet.",

Crawfish was lackluster. Come on where's the Cajun seasoning? Oysters during dinner were a decent value. Besides that everything else is disappointing. Chinese...boring. General Tso's Chicken tastes weird. BBQ Pork buns were not authentic. Pretty crappy Chinese fare actually. Italian? Forget about it...crappy pizza and vegetable lasagna. Indian.... Meh you get better Indian food at a local Indian buffet. Fried chicken? Over fried and probably double fried since they were hard as a rock and not juicy and tender. Mexican? Another meh... Prime Rib was decent. Having lived in the Midwest. Definitely not in the very good category. Not to bad though. I was highly unimpressed with this place. Everything was average to below average. Crab legs, oysters, and shrimp were the only positives. Even the clams and mussels didn't taste that great.  Dessert...wow was I disappointed. Cheesecake was lame. Their Gelato was pretty good.   For lunch $25.99 on the strip. It was ok value. Otherwise save yourself the trouble and go elsewhere.",

There was no wait which should have been a huge sign to me that this buffet wasn't going to be all that good. But I gave it a try and it will be my last visit.  The staff and service people are really nice.  But, the food is nothing special for the amount of money.  Don't get me wrong..the food compares well to less expensive buffets in the area.

The dining area is open and sunny bright that you can see the garden from the floor to ceiling windows.  Wide selection of food - sushi bar, salad bar, Italian, Asian, Indian, meat, desserts, etc., has something for everyone. The snow crab legs are my favorite - fresh and nicely prepared, absolutely delicious!!! The chicken noodle soup is heart warming but not too greasy. The beef brisk is mouth-watering juicy, and the gelato is yummy.  Worth the price, strongly recommended!",

My first experience was great and I would have recommended Aria to friends/family despite their lack of variety. However, during my second visit we did NOT experience items that were served during my first dining experience:  -soft-shelled crab (although a bit salty) -raw oysters -lobster tails (big ones)  There were at least 4 other people who I heard asking \"Where are the lobsters?\" including myself. The answer: \"I THINK it is served on Saturday.\" I mean WTF kind of an answer is that. I don't remember the price we paid but it was probably AT MOST a $4 difference. We paid $36 on Friday.  Summary: To all of you hoping to have lobster tails, go on Saturday. And expect disappointment on any other days.....",

OK, know it's only their second day in operation, but how can you screw up bacon and eggs? My wife and I were shown our table, and immediately went to get our food. The food area was quite long, but not a great selection. Usually I walk and look at the food and figure out the few things that look best so I can fit them onto my plate, but here, it was a struggle to find enough things appealing enough to eat. Their eggs benedict looked very weird; the eggs were freakishly white. Hard to find just regular breakfast fare. There were two omelet stations with many people waiting at each ( you know a buffet is bad when people opt for the 'ol standby omelet) I got in line behind Mr. Picky who had to have a special egg white only omelet with veeeery light Cheddar cheese and was also behind some punk kid who was eating off his plate in line. Idiot. The chef manning the station seemed overwhelmed by the special order so I moved on. A huge slice of ham (not bad), some Chinese egg concoction and a slice of pizza later I went back to eat. Started eating and no server yet. Half way through and still no server. Finally when I was almost done, a server asked if I wanted anything to drink. I barely chocked out, \"orange juice\". Finally, when I was on my second to last bite, my drink came, all six ounces of it. I asked for two more.  For 15 bucks, this should have been much better. I have gotten just a good breakfast at Terribles for half the price. Also, since this place should be one of the elite, what I found totally tacky was at each of the foods, instead of having a nice plaque with what the food is, it was written on the sneeze windows with grease pencil. Totally lame. Not sure if we would go back to eat here even if comped. Perhaps their lunch and dinners are better.",

    "text": "We ate here last week, it was very average.  And average doesn't cut it.  I go back to what I usually say about LV strip buffets... some people aren't going to agree... but... if you're thinking about eating at one...head to the Bellagio, and EAT THERE.  Aria buffet is OK.  But we had dinner on a Sat Nite which was about $40 per person with tax & tip (YES you still tip at the LV buffets) and was NOT worth it.  We don't drink, so the unlimited wine didn't come into play.  The lobster was downright bad, tasteless and dry.  Crab legs were fresh, decent enough...some poeple were just eating those and nothing else.  We had the displeasure of butting heads with the seedier element of Vegas right there in the crab line.  Some hill-billy woman was holding things up, just standing there with no one in front of her.  We politely asked if she was in fact in line - and she got all bent out of shape.  You know the type - fat with the K-Mart shorts exposing legs no one should see, clumps of greasy dirt-blond strands for hair and big, dull neo-biker tattoos on her arms.  How these people get in places like the Aria, who knows.  The buffet probably needs the business.  Anyway...  I gave Buffet at Aria 3 stars for its OK quality.  Plus, the people who work there DO work hard.  I won't  deny them that.  I say that, despite the fact that the cashier was, well, sort of abrasive we felt and the hostesses didn't really seem to have it together.  People were being seated from 2 lines (not the VIP line) and there seemed to be no order to it.  People were getting upset.  It's really more like 2 1/2 stars but I'll give 3 in recognition of the seemingly nice, hard-working serving staff.  But, I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "After eating at the Buffet at Aria, I feel like it was probably the worst bet I made all weekend.   The only good thing about it was our waitress who constantly brought us drinks, sometimes even when they were extra. This was one of the only positive of the night. It's bad when the best thing about a $35.99 (+18% gratuity for parties over 8 + tax) is their Indian Naan and watery hummus.   At the start of the experience, we had to deal with the cashiers who had no idea what they were doing, with the hostess telling us to go to 1 register then the other rudely telling us we were going to the wrong one and that they needed to keep us together so we don't confuse the cashiers (even though we were the only ones in line). Another weird situation was after charging you the 18% mandatory gratuity, they hand you the cash, $12 and some change, and make you hand it to your server. Step 1, pay with credit card, step 2, receive cash, step 3, tip server.   Once we sat, we realized there is not easy access to the rest of the buffet because we were sat in one of these stage like sections of the place, with only one exit to our pod. We were sat pretty close to the old oysters and crab legs, but the line and traffic that it came with was not worth the proximity.   Our group pretty much came to the consensus that for that price, we'd rather eat at the Wynn or the Bellagio, or maybe go to Rio for the cheaper version. The Buffet at Aria, however, was not worth the time or money.   If i had to give it a price, I'd say it belongs around the $15.99 price range for both the food quality as well as the overall decor and service. While our waitress was happy and attentive, it could not save the glaring problems that this buffet faces. I would probably give a few stars leniency for service only, as it was opening week/weekend, however, food quality should not be that bad. It's not like the cooks are learning to cook on the job.

We enjoyed the personal attention we got from the service staff especially as my mom was feeling very sick and weak. They allowed my parents to sit with us and have free drinks even though they didn't pay for the buffet, and turned a blind eye when we forced my mom to eat a little shrimp and dessert.

Furthermore, the selection was terrible.  I will never go back.   We also talked to the manager and politely gave him our opinion about the food.  We asked him if he's tried other buffets such as the Wynn or Bellagio, to which he replied,\"I've actually never tried any of those buffets.\"  I'm very surprised that the manager of this buffet is not going out there and sizing up the competition or even just seeing what a Vegas buffet is like.

The food was many, but too much, clean bars, but the food wasn't very good. I;m not sure maybe cause I'm southern and Vegas taste is different, but the yogurt was sour and not good, maybe it was bad....the sausages were quite a feel to choose from, but all of them also tasted a bit sour and not like your usual mouthwatering ones...only the breakfast sausage was good, the bagles and cream chz were good, everything else wasn;t very tasty or satisfying. Thats all I can say....the service was okay as well, our waitress was ice, but the hosts, bar service, and cashiers sure didn;t seem off in a good feel. But they had a good diverse mix of food I suppose.",

A line started at around noon, but we got there by 11am so it was quick to get in. Service was attentive, except when the BF wanted his 5th bloody mary. Overall it's a decent buffet, and I actually sort of like how the seating arrangement is almost cafetaria-like.",

    "text": "Talk about foreshadowing: anytime you see a short or empty buffet line in Las Vegas, you should beware. The buffet at Aria was average. It was unimpressive for what i thought would be a buffet equal to that of other 5-star hotels like Bellagio or Wynn.   In terms of variety, I felt the aria buffet tried to accomplish that by offering a number of different international cuisines such as indian, chinese, japanese, etc. However, i still felt that WITHIN each cuisine, there just wasn't much. For example, sure they had japanese food, but specifically they only had 3 types of rolls and some nigiri. No other types of sashimi, no unique rolls, no tempura, etc etc.  In terms of seafood, they had the usual king crab legs, shrimp scampi, and oysters, but it wasn't any different from what you would find in any other decent buffet.  In terms of how they serve you the food, it's a little strange: they have their food on smallerl serving plates. While this may give an impression that the dishes are more fresh and replenished more frequently, this also causes an inconvenience to the customer when dishes are constantly running out and staff members have to refill it. This means customers waste more time waiting for their food than eating it.  On a more positive note, the service was excellent. This is strange just because no one really notices the service or remembers their waiter in a buffet, but mine was so good that i certainly did remember. She was always refilling our drinks, asking if we needed anything, and never late in clearing our used plates.   Overall, if you had a choice of buffets at Las Vegas, I would still opt for Bellagio or Wynn. The price at Aria is similar to that of other upscale hotel buffets (~40 for dinner) and simply doesnt satisfy in terms of variety or taste.",

Thanks to my husband's inability to wait 5 minutes once he's hungry and our friends who would rather spend their cash on beverages, rather than food.  So Aria's buffet was our Friday night dinner.  With unlimited wine and a lobster for every two people, $36 sounded like a pretty good deal.  Unfortunately, since we never made it back to our hotel room the night before, I was not at my best for eating.  The buffet had just about everything.  Multiple carving stations that included lamb, turkey, New York steak, pork tenderloin, and prime rib.  I had none of that, so I can't comment other than to say my companions were pleased.  Seafood options included crab legs, shrimp and oysters among other things.    The \"free\" lobster was a mess.  Our order was lost, so there was a long delay, and it was NOT worth the wait.  It was so overcooked, it was like chewing on a piece of rubber.  Minus two stars alone for the senseless slaughter of crustaceans.  If you can't prepare it well enough to at least be edible, don't bother offering it!",

Out drinks weren't refilled as the poor waitresses was running around trying to take too many tables on.   Food: It is allright. You obviously can't compare it to the Bellagio or the Wynn but it's decent. The garlic naan was SO GOOD! It has to be good since it was actually made in those cool stone clay pans and made fresh right on the spot. The shrimp is very large and fresh. The crab labs weren't bad.   Dessert: Ok well you know it has to be good since it was designed by Pastry Champion Jean-Philippe Maury. I literally tried everything! Not too sweet and not too decadent.   I really only came here cuz I had food credit from Aria. I guess it's not bad for the price. I believe it was around $27.00 for dinner per person",

So... if there was a \"0\" star option, I would've picked that and still commented that there needs to be a negative star rating.   This was hands down the worst buffet experience ever. I cant believe they even got away with labeling this a buffet, especially in such an upper scale hotel.   First off, they advertise themselves as being the Crab Leg central of Las Vegas. If by \"crab leg,\" they mean \"cold small crab fingers/slivers,\" then yes, this is your place.   Second, the rest of the buffet was mismatched, random and clearly lacking in any menu planning whatsoever.  You would have a carving station with lamb (no prime rib on the Sunday Brunch Menu, go figure), then next to it, you would have enchiladas, then scrambled eggs. Nothing made sense.   The decor was lack luster, sterile and looked like a hospital cafeteria. This place makes Hometown Buffet look like the Four Seasons.   The only thing good about this place was.... well. yea. nothing. I want my money back.",

A staff member escorted us to the table and politely asked us to watch our step on the stairs. Our server was fantastic. She kept up with husband's refills and she took away our plates promptly. I enjoyed the food selection. I love Indian food so I was happy to see Indian dishes and naan in particular. There were Chinese dishes as well which did not have much or any msg. I finished off the dinner with a sugar-free cheese cake which I enjoyed.  The regular price for dinner is $29.95 which is the same as the Bellagio dinner buffet. I really enjoyed the ambiance and service at the Aria buffet and the food is great. In comparison, the Bellagio dinner buffet has a greater variety of foods but definitely not as lovely of an atmosphere as Aria. I would go back to Aria for the dinner buffet.",

Giving a 3 star rating is kind of a stretch but it wasn't 2 star bad so there you go.   Came in for the lunch buffet my last day in vegas, a bit sad to go and a heck of a lot sadder I couldnt hit up several more buffets but girls gotta party and full stomachs + clubbing dress dont really mix. For $25 per, this place wasnt so bad, with food ranging from japanese, mexican, italian.. etc. Im assuming one has been to a buffet before.   Things to skip: -sushi rolls .. with very little emphasis on the sushi part.. actually, scratch that.. no sushi in sight, just a couple of rice rolled in seaweed with vegetable stuffings. blaaaand. dry. stuck together. disgusting -ceviche .. smelly little cups of \"seafood\" and vegetables in vinegar -kimchi .. next to the chinese food section, the only korean thing there. disappointing. bland. and just plain wrong -some type of nacho .. cheese, beef, salsa.. sitting on top of some corn chips which by the way turned soggy by the time I scooped some up  Things to try: -omelets .. they make them on the spot for you so you really can't go wrong -waffles .. hated the other breakfast items but the waffles were perfect!! -roast meats .. selection of beef, turkey, pork. I got the roast beef with aju and horseradish which was the best thing there -dessert .. at first glance, I thought they had a huge selection but there were maybe 6 cakes and the rest were cookies and danish. Loved the apple pie, banana cream pie, and strawberry cheesecake  -gelato .. the lemon sorbet!!  Things that were eh: -crab legs .. it wasn't bad.. it wasn't good.. it was just meh -chinese food ..  -soups  Overall, the place wasn't horrible but wish i'd gone to the buffet at the bellagio or mandalay bay. Should've just stuck around for the dinner at another buffet anyway since the drive back took 7 freaking hours due to serious traffic!!

We are a family of 5 including a newborn, it started off that after we paid we waited until two hostesses decided to let us in and didn't acknowledge us at no given time while we were waiting to be seated. (We were the only ones in line) Hope who ended us seating us lead us to a table for four and wanted me to put my baby and stroller in the walkway!!! We asked to be seated at the next table over which seated 6 and she refused to do so. We didn't want to make a scene so we just made it work, but ended up blocking another guest sitting next to us. During our whole time eating the table that we wanted stayed empty. Why couldn't we sit there??? Oh yeah it was 5 of us and the table was for 6!!!!!! We will NEVER visit them again.",

Our server told us that we could get the crab legs steamed, which I don't think everyone knew.  But definitely get them steam - they taste so much better.  After the lobster and about 8 plates of crab legs, i couldn't remember anything else they had at this buffet.  Does it matter?",

While the buffet was clean, nicely decorated, and the personnel were all fast and friendly, the food did not live up to my expectations.  LUNCH DISHES: The best items were the beef brisket and the snow crab legs. I found that the rest of the stations were satisfactory but not good enough to go back for seconds.  DESSERT:In my opinion the gelato was the best dessert and I liked that they had a large variety of flavors to choose from. The other desserts that I tried (cheesecake, cake pops, cupcakes, and some cream-like dessert in a shot glass) were not that impressive.",

In contrast Aria buffet cost $27 which I thought had decent food. I enjoyed the snow crab and king crab which obviously tasted frozen. But what do you expect, Las Vegas is not Maine. The fish - halibut and salmon tasted overcooked and dry. I enjoyed the lamb which my friend claimed to taste too gamey for him. My friend also had an under cooked chicken, pink in the center, yuck! But the desserts were a delicious heaven, so many choices. If only I had more room. I recommend starting with the desserts!",

Flor (our waitress) was AWESOME! She was very friendly and kept the champagne coming. I liked that they had Indian food on the buffet. You don't see that often. We did have to wait, but not long. I will say that most of the desserts looked better than they actually tasted. I liked that the crab legs were already cracked for you. It made it way easier to eat. I would recommend this buffet!",

What I liked most was that it wasn't overly busy. You got to enjoy your meal without having to fight through crowds each time through the line. The food is still refreshed regularly so that you're always ensured warm and fresh food each time.   Best part of this buffet is the dessert - no question. So many options and they're all sugar-coma inducing goodness.  If you're looking for a melee style buffet, go elsewhere. But if you're looking for a change of pace, you'll like it here.",

Here there is lighter fare, which is a positive or negative depending on your perspective. While Bellagio has great food, I feel like the Michelin man weighed down by ankle weights when I am finished there. At Aria, I was nice and full but I didn't feel disgusting afterward.   And here the variety is better. It hit all the requisite stations, but it did so in different ways than at traditional buffets.   Two downsides, though: The signage for the food was poor, leaving you to guess what some items were; and the price at 3:30pm was just about $50, including tax/tip.   I recommend, but not for those having to pay for a family.",

    "text": "My brother and I came here for a Thursday \"holiday\" meal on 12/24/09 with dinner pricing at $27-ish+tax+tip and a half an hour wait. The menu looked promising and we had moderate expectations given that this was a new hotel of the MGM Mirage group that would likely have some experience with pushing food at buffets - but we were sadly, sadly disappointed.  THE BAD:  First off, there the buffet line and stations are very utilitarian and remind you of a cafeteria - not a whole lot of good interior design went into designing this space and they wanted to seat us literally a yard away from the the entrance/exit with no barriers between the oncoming traffic. We requested another table and they were kind enough to oblige us.  However, getting to the food - there were long lines for the \"seafood\" section - in which case only shrimp and crab legs were served. Just as we were approaching to serve ourselves - the trays were refilled with literally ROCK HARD FROZEN seafood - inedible, crusty with ice crystals. Even once you let it defrost - it was waterlogged, soggy, mushy and tasteless.   There were two or three carving stations. One with an Indian-style (tandoori?) tri tip or a flatter-style steak where they'd carve you a single small strip and expect you to go on your merry way. The prime rib was cooked beyond well-done. The asian dishes were sub-par as well (wonton soup - the won tons were doughy, undercooked, and the kind with the super thick wrappers that you know no real establishment that caters to the Chinese would serve)  THE GOOD:  My highlight of the night was taking the tikka masala sauce (and passing on the dry sinewy chicken that soaking in it) and mixing it into bowls of basmati rice... mmm so good!!!! This literally saved my meal and stopped me from good-flavor-starvation. But definitely not what I should've paid for. The flank steak was wonderful with the garlicy/oniony topping. Desserts had a nice selection, gelato was passable, and pastries were what you'd expect them to be.",

For $48 dollars each, you get unlimited food, wine, and they also serve lobster tail. But after being seated, we realized there was a lack of staff, and we were getting pretty thirsty. We flag down a person who looks to be ranked higher, and explain that we'd like our server so we can get some soda or water, or wine even.  Finally, I take my receipt and I go to walk to the front to complain, because according to my receipt, I have been sitting here for 20 mins with no drink, no \"hi i'm so and so\" no nothing.  As i'm about to instigate, I notice a lady with what looks to be our drinks on her tray. So I went back and didn't complain. We got our drinks and then we went to get our plates for the buffet.  Everything looked really really good - presentation gets an A to A+ for the most part, however the 20 min wait for drinks should have been our first indication...  I placed a few items on my plate: tamale, white Indian rice, tandoori chicken, asparagus, potatoes, pineapple and cantaloupe, a slice of steak meat, and some pita bread.  All of it tasted either bland, bad, nasty, awful, or worse.  Round 2: pita bread, indian white rice, curry vegetables on top.  I want my $48 dollars back. I should have kept walking past the waitress lady and complained like I was doing, but I backed out because I didn't want to be the asshole in my group who complained.  Well, realize you need \"bad guys\" sometimes, who will point the finger and hold others accountable: This place took over 20mins to get us soda, and their food was so bad we all almost had to get McDonalds or something to cover up the nasty food we just ate.   Never again. NEVER NEVER NEVER.",

The crab legs were thawing out and were soggy. The lobster was rubbery. Curry chicken dry. Everything else tasted salty or bland.   Service: there was unlimited wine and despite ordering the wine when we sat down, we were halfway through our meal before we were served the first round, The dirty plates were not cleared from our table and were stacked up high before they came by (we were with a party of 8).   Seating: Our table and chairs were constantly vibrating and shaking. When we asked what was causing the vibrations, we were told that it had something to do with the air conditioning system below. The constant vibration along with the horrible food made all of us feel like we were sea sick.   STAY AWAY! ! !",

However i had to write this one during our stay at the SKY SUITES in ARIA, met a group of college friends for reunion, first thing we were force to pay a 18 -20% gratuity up front for party of 8 or more. The cost per person was about $36 Saturday lunch plus tips $6 ($42) and there was no line, i know why now. Food was mediocore at best, a step above circus cirucs of what i remembered. The snow crabl legs were 2nd tiered quality and size. We are paying for 1st tier pricing. The rest of the selection was average at best. Turly a bad experience and this was my 3rd and final time going to this place. Service was good but of course 20% for a buffet.

Perhaps my favorite thing there was the creme strawberries and bananas. I'm sure they laced it with coke. There is no other explanation to pay $50 so I can get in to eat strawberries and bananas.   The staff are friendly and wholesome. I say check out your choices of buffets before deciding to eat here, but you're staying in the hotel, this to me is clearly the most convenient choice.",

Unfortunately, 1/2 of the food I got, I did not like. I normally love breakfast sausage, but the sausage here was really dry. The cocktail shrimp was soggy, the hashbrown was really really dry and flavorless, and so was this bread that had sun-dried tomatoes on it.  The food that was good were the egg benedict, prime rib, and crab legs, and the desserts. So you should just ignore everything and just stick with those three and have dessert.   The desserts that I had were chocolate cake, flan, and creme puff. They were all really good, but I think I like the chocolate cake the best. My boyfriend liked the flan and he also got himself oreo ice cream with m&ms, which was really good too.  I wouldn't mind coming back here, because some of the food here are really good, you just need to know what to stay away from....",

We ate here on a weekday and not a weekend (where they have lobster) and my oh my was it ever disappointing.  $30 for a weeknight buffet, knowing what I know now, we would have went to M buffet or even RIO for half off local special.  BUT now we know, and knowing is half the battle (G.I. JOE!). You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA.   SUSTENANCE: Food was okay.  The problem was the selection, not a very large buffet. The night we went they had 2 slabs of meat , prime rib and beef brisket at the carving station.  The Prime Rib was a little dry and not as good as other buffets that serve that cut.  The brisket was a bit better and was very tender and delicious. They had a plethora of salads, i enjoyed the spicy shrimp and the orzo salad, not too bland and good flavor.  Crab legs were chilled and pre-sliced leaving you to do little work to get that oh so succulent crab meat.   TIP: You can have them steam your crab legs if you ask!  They had the typical fare for the rest of the buffet and though the selection wasn't that large to begin with you can tell they were at least TRYING to be a good buffet. There was a trio of Indian fare (chicken in curry and an eggplant dish were pretty decent), some Italian selections (pasta station w/ choice of 3 sauces - pomodoro, alfredo, and i forget the 3rd), Mexican station (gauc, shredded beef, umm I couldn't find tortilla shells), and a Chinese area (typical Chinese food - chow mein, orange chicken, etc).  Dessert was good.   Cinnamon bread pudding, red velvet whoopee pies, and carrot cake with a strawberry sauce were my fav's.   but still...  You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA.   AMBIANCE: Modern decor with bright colors and tiles on the wall.  A little plain and one person in our group even mentioned that it felt like we were eating at a hospital cafeteria. We all agreed.  You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA.   For $30, I would rather walk across the bridge to cosmopolitan and eat at Wicked Spoon Buffet for $5 more.  If you want to eat here just to \"try it cause you've tried all other buffets\" (the reason we ate here) then by all means go right ahead, but If you trust your fellow yelpers...skip this one. You'd expect a lot more from a place like ARIA.",

There was not that many choices for food and it was kind of disappointing since I thought Aria would have more for their buffet for some reason. They do however have iced and steamed crab legs so I was all for that. I suggest not getting anything from the Asian section but that might just be cause I live where there is dim sum every two buildings but it was very dry to me. Dessert section did not have a huge variety and for me it was overly sweet but the appearance was pretty. Everything else was pretty mediocre but the service was great and they were all very friendly and efficient! They had very few people working but they were all very attentive and made sure we had drinks and anything else we needed.",

    "text": "I went for brunch on a Friday morning around 11am.  The line was super small and it only took us about 10-15 minutes to be seated.  We were a large group of 11 and they had no issues.  We also ordered the unlimited champagne with our brunch price.  The atmosphere in the place was very nice and open.  I liked how they really separated the buffet area from the tables.  This allowed for better movement.  After reading these reviews I was surprised to have the nicest waitress.  She was so kind and constantly checked up on us to make sure we had enough champagne.  She was such a sweetheart.  I wish I knew her name.  The champagne was good, and one friend got the bloody Mary and she seemed to enjoy it.  The food selection was much better than I thought it would be.  To start off they had crab legs, which I didn't think they would for a Friday brunch.  They were a good size and very delicious.  They also had bagels made to order where you could get smoked salmon along with some other spreads.  They had a carving station that had ham and brisket.  Some of my favorite dishes were the lentil curry, carrot ginger soup, pad tai, and spicy shrimp cups.  The desert selection was also very nice.  I'm not much of a dessert person but they had lots of gelato, cookies, bananas foster, cakes, and anything you could think of.  I was really happy with their ethnic food selection as well.    Overall I would definitely returns because of the reasonable price, great service, and quality of food.",

    "text": "Starting with the hotel decor, this place is amazing.  You get two choices a) Buffet with coffee, tea, soda or juice, or b) Buffet with champagne or bloody marys. Obviously choice b is a bit more money but worth it.   There's food for everyone... salad, sushi, crab legs, pizza, breakfast, meats, Chinese... you name it, they have it. On top of that, they change what they offer depending on time.   The eggs benedict were delicious, so were the waffles. Sushi was good, fresh. Pizza was ok, but it usually is in all places you have them as a buffet, under a heating lamp.   One thing I fell in love with was the dessert section. I only had the flan, and the coffee shooter, could not eat anything else after seeing so much food, but there's so many of them and so beautifully decorated and presented. If you are a dessert person, do leave room for these, my friends and I all chose different desserts from each other and agreed this was the best part of the meal.   Staff is very friendly and attentive, always a good thing.   So, all you can eat, drinks, good service and, at a beautiful hotel = must try it!",

Both members of our party were ill for the remainder of the trip and stayed in their hotel rooms. When we called early  the next morning to ask if others had become ill we were told nobody had called and they served over 2,000 people and there was no way we became ill from eating there. We don't know if others called after we did. But seemed odd that the \"manager\" could be sure that we did not get sick from eating there. He told me to call security and file a report. I asked him what good that would do my wife and he said he did not know but that was what we needed to do. No apology, no empathy. Keep in mind we paid $75 (per couple) for this meal and one would expect better than this.  As a result we will never set foot in another MGM property again. The situation was handled poorly.",

I can't wait for the Ivy League players to get into the mix.  Anyway, back to food: as with many buffets, you have to know what to select and what to avoid. Unfortunately some of the most appealing-on-paper choices are also the worst here: the crab legs, the Asian station, and the tandoori oven cooked naan bread should be avoided at all costs. What I personally liked the most were some of least popular options: the grilled vegetables, the quinoa and tabouli salads. The prime rib and steamed clams in a tomato base were also good.  My wife got the surf & turf which was cold lobster paired with a quality rib eye in a bernaise sauce. However, the majority of things we tried here were just not up to snuff. The service was very friendly & efficient, and we never had to wait long for anything.  Definitely not worth the money, but the variety of options, pleasant setting and service make it a good option if you are staying here and want to eat ASAP.",

The foods were quite mediocre.  They have alot cutbacks for their brunch.  King Crabs are gone, snow crabs instead (Like Wynn).  FYI, King Crab only available on weekend dinner so I have been told. The quality of the crab is....crap.  Soggy and soft.  Lack of flavors.  Rest of the foods were non remarkable.  The presentations weren't good so did the taste of food.   Dry steaks, dry salads. Horrible Asian stations and their Italian station didn't look too good either.  Their desserts are one of their best tasting station to save this review from having 1* only.  I like their cheese cakes and apple pie but rest of them are just ...blah.  Save of your money and go somewhere else.  If you are on comp.

The way it is set up is very nice and easy to wander around along with being attractive, but I won't be going back, not for the price and the selection.

It became very frustrating dining experience.  Food was hit and miss, it wasn't great but was not the worst. Some of the food tasted like it's been sitting there for hours. Salmon was good though. Other than that, some of the items never got refilled so we didn't have the chance to try it.   To be honest, this is the kind of service and food from aria. I do expect more from aria. As for now, we do NOT recommend this buffet to anyone we know.",

The presentation, flavor and portions are the BEST!!   - lunch had no line.  - service - efficient, friendly   - variety of buffet menus including different ethnic dishes: Indian, Japanese, Chinese, American, Italian, etc  BAD:  - watery salty crab legs. Not Alaskan  - rubbery sushi  - saw a server putting things into his mouth when he thought no one was looking. very gross.  NEUTRAL:  - atmosphere matches the rest of the hotel - modern and hip, but looks a bit sterile, like a cafeteria.  Would I go back? yes, if i wanna stuff myself with the best desserts in town. Heck, $22 is worth it just for the desserts!!!",

    "text": "We ate at the Aria buffet since we were staying in the hotel (the other buffet we were going to try had a ridiculously long line).  There was no line at Aria.    The price over thanksgiving weekend was inflated (I do not recommend dining at a buffet over holiday weekends as the prices of most buffets are over-inflated and definitely not worth the price increase)  The food is comparably \"fresher\" than other buffets but the selection is very limited.   The buffet boasts the only tandoor oven at a Vegas buffet. I found the naan to have a biscuit like quality which is not to my liking. The tandoori chicken however was very juicy and succulent. Taste somewhat lacking though.   The other standout was the crab legs (fortunately served hot - I hate cold crab legs).   Seafood - slightly above par in all respects The pasta and salad selection was surprisingly decent.   Carvery - standard selection - preparation slightly below par Dessert selection - below par in all aspects.  Asian food - below par in all aspects.   You should go to this buffet if you hate waiting in lines and if they are charging their standard price.",

Really, they're kinda in a hidden type area of the Aria, so maybe they're hiding out and when someone stumbles upon it they think, oh well, I don't know where I am anyway so let's just go in!  I love me a buffet, so going out to Vegas is exciting because it's like buffet country.  I barely picked up anything in my graze of the stations.  Nothing really looked that appetizing.  It's definitely a smallish buffet, but I'd still think quality over quantity for the mola you're shelling out.    The only good thing was the dessert bar.  I always enjoy a soft chocolate chip cookie and brownie.  So that kinda made things better, but not really.  If you stumble upon this place and you haven't eaten in days and you're starving it would be fine.  If you have the time to meander to anther... I'd pick that option!",

After our meal, we asked one of the other waitress, Ruby(who had a kind smile), to get us the manager.  The managers name was Geraldine and she was respectful and was kind as well. We told her that we just had an amazing experience ate the Aria Buffet and our waitress, Kelly, was a really pleasant waitress. Kelly, aside from doing her duties, is such a gem to the restaurant. Her personality is exceptional and went past my expectations as a customer. In a short period of time, Kelly had built a rapport with us and made us feel extra comfortable. We exchanged small talks and we found out that aside from her working full time, she fosters kids,feeds the homeless and cooks for them on top of her medical challenges.  I hope that one day, she would get some type of help doing what she's doing or get some type of appraisal for her work ethic. She's a perfect example of a dream employee who leaves her personal challenges outside of work and perform very well at work till the last second of her shift. I am planning on coming back because of Yesenia, Geraldine, Ruby and KELLY. Thank you for the great experience, I wish that every restaurant worker had you guys' attitude and smile each day at work. And thank you for the amazing gelato!!",

The carving was chickens 3 kinds, rib eye, roast beef and prime rib.   The experience was great and I can't understand the complaints about price. This is a classy buffet with top notch good foods!

You're not pinned down to mimosas. You can order anything off of the list! Rum punch is delicious.  I love that they have steamed crab legs + clarified butter.   I like that they have lots of things I want to try a little bit of, but...  I don't like that there's nothing (besides crab legs, of course) that I just think is amazing and want to keep eating more of that single item. Nothing stands out.  Their dessert area, while plentiful, still falls short of the gorgeous, decadent desserts that Wicked Spoon offers.   And in the neutral zone: staff. Very hit or miss. Some of the line staff is wonderful and kind, while others give you rude looks if you try to get their attention. Same thing with your dedicated server; sometimes there, sometimes not.  Out of all the buffets I've been to, Aria still ranks in my top 5, mostly due to steamed crab legs and the great deal on drinks!",

By this time we were already angry.  So many tables and sections were not being used despite the very long line behind us.  We couldn't figure out what they were waiting for.  For at least 20+ minutes they just stopped seating anyone.  Dinner started at 3 so what's the problem??   We had a 2 for 1 or we would have just walked away.  Many people left so they lost a lot of business.  Some were staying there and they weren't happy either.

    "text": "Solid 3.5 rounding up to 4.  I used a MyVegas Bogo voucher for lunch at this buffet, so for $22.99 for two people you can't complain! We missed breakfast time's cutoff by just a few mins, so if you show up just before 11am you can get in for a few bucks cheaper ($19.99) and stay for the lunch items.  We came on a Monday so no line to pay or get seated. The buffet was already busy but there were still lots of tables available.  First plate: Saw the dim sum first, so got a sui mai and two har gow. Sui mai was a little dense, but the har gow was pretty good. The shrimp inside very plump. Got a piece of proscuitto and some mini mozzerella balls, both were good. There was a bowl of olives (and I love olives) but they were all too hard.  Then I turned and saw all this seafood! Snow crab legs were cut open for easy eating. The leg sections were actually pretty sweet. The body sections were more bland and watery. Peel and eat shrimp small but nice and plump. Green lipped mussels and smaller black mussels (green ones were better), and some crawfish (bland).  2nd plate: I didn't realize they had warm crab, crawfish, and other shellfish just on the other side, so I got those as well. I actually preferred the cold crab legs bc the warm ones were dried out. Same with the crawfish. They had green mussels in a lemongrass broth that was pretty good.  Then there were the standard CA roll type sushi. Not bad. The only one that had fish in it was the Philly roll.  On the other side of this island they have soups that they serve in Le Creuset cookware--fancy! I tried the clam chowder. Tasted good, but the problem is the pots don't heat up the soup as well as the traditional soup pots they use in buffets.  3rd plate: This was what I was waiting for at this buffet. The Indian food! The naan was really good; thin and chewy at the \"point\", and soft and fluffy at the \"crust\". The curries were pretty good but I could have liked them a bit more spicy. The chicken was my favorite. The basmati rice was nice and firm. I hate mushy rice. I'd pass on the dolmades and falafel. Dolmades was mushy, and falafel was too hard and dry.  4th plate: Finally I get to the carving station! The Portuguese sausage was my favorite. Probably all time favorite sausage, ever. It has a nice texture, with thin casing, and not too salty. The pork belly was very soft, but the skin was not crunchy. I didn't try the beef, but it was a huge hunk of beef and they called it a beef steamship.  I thought I needed some salad, so over to the salad bar. My favorite was the persimmon and pomegranate salad. I always thought I hated persimmon, so I decided to try it again. It's good! It's like a cross between an apple and melon. My mom used to force me to eat over ripened persimmon when I was a child and I guess that's why I thought I hated it. Still to this day I cannot eat over ripped fruit. This persimmon had a nice light crunch to it.  They also have small sandwiches, and I chose the grilled veggie one. I love eggplant. It had grilled eggplant, avocado, and caramelized onion. I just ate the insides with the Portuguese sausage and it was a great match.  5th plate: Now I'm about to explode. A slice of white pizza with spinach, where I added sun dried tomatoes and proscuitto. So good! The pizza wasn't even hot but the crust was crunchy! How do they do it? Even with all the oil and cheese, and even the very first bite that is usually the softest, soggiest part of a pizza was crunchy.  And had to get another piece of naan and some more salad. Love me some naan bread.  6th plate: Dessert I'm not a huge sweets person, so I really appreciate when places have creme brulee, panna cotta, and similar bc they aren't too sweet. No creme brulee, but they did have panna cotta. I didn't like the berry topping, but the custard was good. Bf said the cheesecake was a lot richer than usually but still good (too rich to finish though), and the mint chocolate ice cream was as you would expect. They have a ton of ice cream flavors, but no soft serve and no cones.  Overall, food was pretty good. Staff kept the place really clean. Food was always coming out. Our server was like a ghost. Everytime we came back to our table, our glasses were refilled and our plates were taken away. Def will return when I get another BOGO voucher.",

It was not that well done but OK.  It's cut funny and is hard to get out of shell and they didn't have the traditional tools to use so you just kind of have up on it.  There is a variety of cuisines like Mexican, Indian, Chinese, Japanese, etc.  A nice dessert selection and carving area with all kinds of meat.  Again, nothing I would go back to but not bad.",

This was our last stop before hitting the road and heading back to LA. The buffet has lots of options and I made sure to try a bit of everything during lunch hour.   Only thing I was disappointed with are the Egg Rolls, they're terrible! I loved the seafood. However, they don't have a sushi selection. I saw one type of sushi and it looked like california rolls. It actaully looks like their menu changes periodically, so I won't comment on what I ate.   Their waiter did a great job waiting on us. Kept our drinks filled, which was quite important for a group of hungover guys.   I thought the lunch buffet price was decent, considering how much I ate. I definitely ate more than what I paid for.

So the $20 for the buffet is pretty reasonable for the \"neighborhood\".  The breakfast buffet has the usual barnyard massacre meat items, most of which were pretty good. There are also lighter fruit/vegetable selections, cereals, etc., but you're in Vegas so live it up a little.  What a lot of people don't get about a buffet is that not all items have to be good and not all items you have to like. The worst buffet reviews are variations of, \"The buffet had 115 items but I'm giving it two stars because the potato salad sucked!\" Hmmm... So a buffet with 115 items of which you hated one item sucks? How is that worse than going to a regular restaurant where you order one item and have to roll the dice on that one item?  Anyways... This is a solid breakfast option in the Aria / City Center area.",

    "text": "Having been dragged to yet another buffet, I was pleasantly surprised. The quality of the food at The Buffet at ARIA seems much improved (perhaps in inverse proportion to the food at the Buffet at Bellagio?). And, with the LOCALS DISCOUNT, the price of the Gourmet Dinner (Fridays through Sundays, 3 p.m. - 10 p.m.) was only $30, rather than $43.  When I ate there last Sunday night, the baked salmon entree was delicious. Could-have-been-served-to-you-in-an-actual-ARIA-restaurant-and-you-would-have-been-happy delicious. I was also happy to fill up on a tasty multi-colored beet salad, still-snappy green beans, and various other practically-healthy vegetable dishes.  I thought the desserts could have been better: the sugar free panna cotta was lacking, at the very least, sugar, and the cannolis, though properly made with lemon and without chocolate chips, needed more ricotta and less unidentifiable whipped ricotta substitute.  He of the highly unrefined palate (i.e., my other half) disagreed: he was absolutely delighted with his rice crispy treats and caramel corn.  Given that this IS a Las Vegas buffet, with the requisite hordes, I recommend arriving early or late to avoid the lines at the cashier and sitting along the outside windows to avoid the general fray.",

I thought some of the other delicious items were the blueberry blintz, the side of mashed potatoes & gravy, and general so's chicken & fried rice. The dessert selections were delicious as well, especially the panna cotta!  The services was spot on during the time we were eating. We got drink refills in a timely manner, our plates were cleared off our table while we got up to get another plate, and for what we received, we thought the buffet was very fairly priced.  Although the line to get in was long, we thought it was worth the wait. This has by far been the best buffets I've been to in Las Vegas!",

We waited for almost 2 hrs for the brunch, when it was our turn brunch hour had ended and automatically we were charged with dinner price ( which starts at 3 pm). We did not mind to pay dinner price hoping that the buffet would include king crab legs as some reviews had mentioned. Dinner buffet at Aria was disappointing, overpriced, very noisy as the music was loud. The seafood (shrimp, snow crab legs) were salty. There were no king crab legs. The poke station did not have tuna, nor salmon, it only had octopus. No raw oyster, just oyster rockefeller which was good but we were given only 2 oysters per visit. The pho/noodle station was ok, the broth could have been hotter. Overall, the aria buffet is inferior comparing to the buffet at Caesars in terms of quality, selection, space, atmosphere, will not recommend this buffet to anyone. The server was nice that is the reason for 3 stars rating",

Luckily, ARIA exceeded expectations!  There was such a better variety with my favorite part being the dim sum and Asian selections.  There was also a lot of delicious seafood options, deli, standard breakfast, among other sections. The low point were the desserts, which were a bit stale and flavorless.

While heading back to the strip, we found out that Wicked Spoon was also closed between 2:30 - 5 pm and we passed on spending $60 each for Bacchanal. Instead we found ourselves back at Aria and decided to give the Buffet at Aria a try.  We missed the lunch cut-off at 3 pm by 20 minutes, so we paid the dinner price at $37.99 per head. The buffet's food area is not as comprehensive as Bacchanal, but still offered plenty of selection for indulging. If looking from left to right, they have Sweets, Asian, Italian, Pizza, Mediterranean, Tandoori, Latin, Carvery, and Diner. Two islands in the middle of it all have the Fish Market and Salad. I was pleasantly surprised with the seafood variety available: steamed crab legs, peelable shrimp, clams, mussels, seared ahi tuna, cooked salmon, seafood paella, sushi, and more. I was also pleasantly surprised that they have Coke Zero available from their offerings of Coke drink products!  Other than the seafood, I filled up on prime rib (so yummy with fresh horseradish too!), creamed corn, mac and cheese, and spinach dip. If you stop by the Salad area, they have fresh fruit juice and thai tea ready for dispensing. At the end of the meal, I was slightly disappointed with their desserts. While I enjoyed the oreo whoopie pie, tiramisu cup, cookies and Merlyn Monroe popcorn (white chocolate drizzled popcorn), their gelato and ice cream flavors were just okay. I usually like to end with a fruit sorbet, but they only had coconut and mandarin yuzu. Coconut - I'm allergic to, and mandarin yuzu - super tart. BF got the cherry cola and pistachio and loved the pistachio one so much - definitely get the pistachio if you can!  No discounts for Mlife members, but show your Mlife card to rack up points.",

The staff at the entrance claimed to have oysters, but sure enough they were not the raw ones we expected. We had two baked oysters, and they were not cleaned properly and had so much sand inside. What was worse was they stopped providing more oysters after we took two. Same thing with the Jonah crab legs -- they just stopped bringing out more and pretend nothing happens.   Our waitress, on the other hand, did not make the experience better. We paid $19.99 for the all you can drink and ordered two cocktails. Okay, she took my order first doubting that I would like Bloody Mary, then 15 minutes later, she brought back THREE drinks. She explained that she understands that we will be drinking a lot very fast, so she brought an additional one in advance. Hm...not sure I really liked having the third cocktail with melted ice by the time I got to it, not to mention my desire wanting to try a different drink instead of having the same one twice.   The food in general was mediocre. For $47.99, we expected a better experience. Service was very minimal. Based on the (lack of) service, it almost seemed like the waiters had not been receiving proper tips for a long time and didn't expect to receive any. Not sure who to blame for this. We were at Wicked Spoon the same morning for brunch and had a much better time there.",

    "text": "I am not a fan of buffets in general. Typically there are lots of starchy items and many dishes are over salted. But, if you know the game, they can be very good. The Buffet at Aria is big but was at total capacity when we got into the line. We were still in line for more than an hour.  There was several different stations and many of them had a \"made to order\" window. The Italian window made fresh pasta dishes with shrimp or chicken. The Asian window had Mongolian bbq. The carving station had tri-tip, chicken, turkey, ham, and a couple of sausage choices. Then there was the seafood. Everything I tried was excellent with one exception. The paella was over salted.  The desert section was outstanding. The gelato and the chocolate mousse on peanut butter wafers that were also covered in chocolate were amazing.  Some odd stuff here. Spoons were an issue. There were no spoons on the table nor by the gelato. So to get a spoon, you had to go to the far side of the buffet to the far side of the salad section to a small basket of spoons. To get this information, we asked a server about spoons. She told us to ask our server to get them for us. Our server the told us about the basket of spoons. Being a very busy establishment, it took a bit. So our gelato was halfway melted by the time we got spoons to eat it.",

    "text": "Second Only to the Wynn and I Ate at ALL of the Main Buffets During My Stay  Ok I slept mainly at the Aria hotel but this does not affect my review of their Buffet. I five starred the hotel also as it deserves it!  The Buffet was dynamite, food was hot and selection endless, as well as quality of Aria Buffet food very high. Behind the steam tables MANY smiling faces! And quality protien foods meaning not 1001 ways to serve useless carbs as Bellagio seemed to do.  the chef was funny and enocuraged me to take some scones in my purse!  He said \"everyone else does!\"  ENJOY!  I am a high stakes player so next time I will bring a bigger purse!!!  Compared to all the other buffets, except the Wynn and Mirage-this was the brightest, easiest to attend and \"happy\" buffet in Vegas. Food was also HOT when it is supposed to be hot (Bellagio was cold and useless with the added insult of very pricey!) The selection at the Aria was also wonderful and recipes from every type of country featured you could think of.  I see some reviews rail the \"staff.\" This is somewhat True but I did not focus on the staff--mainly the food, quality, variety and thoughtfulness put into their buffet. It is five star. I do agree their staff could all smile more...but their jobs probably very hard. I do agree Mirage Buffet was also dynamite AND EVERY person I walked into THANKED us for our business and let us know we were truly appreciated! And they were sincerely smiling. That stunned me.  If Aria could just get their staff to \"fake it\" or maybe pay them a LITTLE more to SMILE--it would be six star. Also keep in mind what just happened down the street. Many people were impacted by that. More so the locals that serve us and this may be heavy on their mind.",

I would recommend this buffet for meat eaters since there was a variety of choices to choose from. For a vegetarian? Only if you have a resort credit and vegans, forget about it.  The service was great. One of the best I've experienced at a buffet.  The waiters were nice and quick with drink orders and table clean up.",

    "text": "My group of three came here for the weekend brunch.  It wasn't super crowded when we got there which kind of worried me.  But since the dining room looked remarkably pretty for a buffet, I decided to hold off judgement until after I taste the food.  First thing I noticed...crab legs.  Pre-cut crab legs!  Less fuss, more yummy!  Points for that for sure!  I initially lined up for an omelette but the line got super long.  So I bypassed it and went with a meat theme. I tried the prime rib, bbq brisket, turkey, and roast pork, all fresh cut for me on demand.  In general, the meat was the star of this brunch today...something I did not expect for a weekend brunch meal.  I did eventually get the omelette later in the meal and it was worth the wait.  I liked how most or all of the buffet items were prepared gluten-free which is a very proud thing to boast.  However, in my attempt to avoid tummy filling carbs, I looked past the different unique flavored cream cheeses and bagels, pancakes, waffles, and wrapped fruit blintzes.  Even the eggs benedict looked tempting as well.  One thing that baffled me were the Asian hot dishes...like noodles and stir fried beef.  I wasn't sure how they fit in with the brunch theme...I didn't see sushi/sashimi which I would had gladly tried.  The price point of $35 in comparison to the regular weekday breakfast/lunch is quite steep.  My companions did try the bottomless bloody marys and were very satisfied with it but they weren't \"wowed\" by it.  All in all, 3.5 STARS for a pretty room with decent, but not great food selections near the Aria pool.",

    "text": "After having experienced the Carnival World Buffet disaster the night before, we were a tad bit leary of buffets.......BUT, we had these complimentary passes to any MGM resort buffet, the Aria being one of them, so we could not pass up a \"freebie.\"  Four of us ate an $80 meal for free.  That's good enough for me.  I was a bit leary also because I had read others' reviews, and I wasn't so sure it was going to be anything decent.  The Rio's World buffet was decent enough (for what I wanted), but there was just so much other BS that it was pretty unenjoyable for us.  Here, at the Aria buffet, we were pleasantly surprised.  I pretty much got cold foods like various kinds of ceviche, sushi, Thai salads, cold, poached whitefish, salmon spread.  The ceviches, in particular, were quite tasty, if not spicy, but I really enjoyed them all.  I didn't participate in their halved, ready to eat crab legs.  I had enough the night before.  I also couldn't muster up the desire to eat hot foods, then ultimately stuffing myself......so I didn't.  Plus, I had to save room for Jean Phillipe's pastries.....oh, hell YAH !!!  That was a MUST.  Unfortunately, for me, a pastry snob and baker in my own right, they were good, but they were NOT amazing.  Sorry, but they weren't.  I tasted the banana caramel cake, and it was just banana cake.  Couldn't taste caramel.  The apple rum raisin pie was overpowered by the rum flavored raisins......wasn't a fan.  The bread pudding was my favorite, that, I definitely liked.  I also tasted their strawberry gelato.......quite delicious and packing a strong strawberry punch.  The chocolate brownie was laced with too many walnuts......a turn-off for me.  The pecan bar was decent, but the cappuccino dollop didn't work with it.  Here's the other thing.......downstairs from the buffet is an actual shop of Jean Phillipe's pastries, and THOSE will dazzle your eyes.  THOSE were amazing to look at, and while I didn't get to try any (too full !!!), I would like to think they were better than was presented upstairs at the buffet.  I'd like to know why ALL of those items were not offered at the buffet.  That was a bit disappointing to me.  That being said, all too many times we have all discovered the oh so great looking food item LOOKS better than it tastes, so while I know to beware of the \"looks can be deceiving\" reality, I just don't know with the store displays...........those pastries are so impressive.  I would go back to this buffet again......maybe when I'm in a mood to try hot foods, perhaps more room in my stomach.  However, I would probably hold out for the Jean Phillipe Patisserie downstairs......gotta try some of those next time !!!!!  I think this place is 3.5 worthy, but all I can only select 3 on the scale.",

If you want a fine dining experience - go to Scarpetta or Guy Savoy. If you want an amazing buffet - it's at Aria.   I first went to the Aria buffet in October 2012 and by the time of my next visit in October 2013, it had been revamped. I liked it originally, but the re-do makes the experience even better. My friend and I visited for lunch, and the price was very reasonable - maybe $22? Complimentary beverages are served in classy stemless wine glasses and our cheerful server was all about making sure we stayed hydrated.   Of all the things I ate, the only bite I wasn't crazy about was a lone potsticker. That means I found the following things delicious: chicken salad, ham, macaroni & cheese, mashed potatoes, sushi (albeit the rice was a tad dry), antipasti, mushroom bruschetta, French onion soup, corned beef hash, gazpacho, crab legs, mussels, pecan tart, chocolate cake, coconut macaroons...and probably more things I can't remember.",

Sure, the quality of the meat and seafood seemed good but there wasn't anything spectacular.  We came away not feeling satisfied. The price at $50 is about right for a Vegas buffet. The standard offering of Chinese Mexican Indian Italian dishes are typical of most such format but nothing stood out. Service was adequate. The night we visited  the soups were lukewarm and not kept hot. The noodle station was left unmanned. We had to get someone's attention to serve us. Choices were confusing as the same noodles and soup bases were used for diners to create miso soup, pho etc. with garnishes. There was only a tiny number of sushi choices and frankly not very good. Overall it was not impressive. We know from our dining experiences elsewhere at Aria that it can do better.",

We came here for dinner. When you go and survey the place, it would look like that you will have alot of selection, but you don't. One section was serving Indian food, so one section was all Hummus, Baba ganoush and stuff. In short, just sauces.  I like and appreciate Chicken Tandoori, when I tried it, it was  dry, looks like it was over cooked. I went back to see if the other batch would be better... looked the same, so I did not bother. The Prime rib was okay. I tried their Italian section, I like their clam & Mussles soup. Their pasta selection was \"lifeless\".

Kind and patient with a group of us who are 15 altogether. Food is what you come for. The service is what you come back for. Thanks Eva!",

Thus my boyfriend and I returned for breakfast.  Boy were we in for a surprise...a salmonella surprise, that is.  I was so pumped they had an eggs benedict station, so I got two different types of my favorite eggs benedict.  But upon cutting into both eggs it became apparent that about 70% of the egg white was significantly under cooked (and by under cooked I mean the egg \"white\" was clear/transparent).  I looked at the table next to me and sure enough her eggs benedict was under cooked too.    Thankfully our waitress noticed my displeasure and took the eggs back to the chef to show him they were under cooked.  She was the saving grace to that breakfast, so we thanked her with a nice tip.  Someone else below mentioned how pleasant the African American man was at the carving station.  I'd like to second that.  My boyfriend thanked him about 5 times and the guy was so gracious and \"just happy to be here\".  He definitely put a smile on our faces.  I would have given the place 1 star but the staff was very friendly.",

We were there over the holiday and paid about $110 since hubby got the unlimited drinks too.  Nothing was good except the pie my hubby had and their little glasses of salad. The oysters were not edible, crab legs weren't salted, the floor was covered in food and cloth napkins were on the ground next to our table! How busy are you to leave gross food and napkins on the floor. The staff was rude or just ignored you at the salad and carving stations. I heard some guy ask for the lamb that just came out and the carving guy told him no and that he could have the stuff that had been sitting there for a while. I was so shocked, I skipped getting anything from the carving station hoping someone new will come later.  If you hate your job, why not find another one. We will never never return! I was so disappointed that we will not return to Aria to even gamble or stay anymore! Too many other buffets and casinos that provide good service and food. Also, we gamble thousands per day and don't mind paying, but bad food and rude service, no thank you.",

    "text": "It seems a lot of people were unimpressed with this buffet, so I came with little expectations but came away pleasantly surprised. During my trip to vegas I went to the buffets at M, Aria, and Planet Hollywood and surprisingly this was my favorite. While it isn't perfect, as long as you are selective with what you eat I believe this makes for a pleasant dining experience. I came here for lunch and while $20 isn't cheap, I easily got my money's worth stuffing myself with crab legs, jumbo shrimp, and raw shellfish. The prime rib was the best I had among the 3 buffets, although that wasn't saying much as none were as good as the prime rib at even an average sit down restaurant.  Pizza, which in most buffets doesn't even look like food, actually looked edible here, though I didn't try it. The asian food was entirely forgettable, but again, I don't go to buffets to eat those kinds of things.They also had an excellent selection of desserts which were nicely presented. Most of the desserts were good but avoid the fruity sauce thats on the side of the cakes because they're way too sweet.  Perhaps the thing that stood out the most at this place is the service. I was very thirsty that day and was downing my coke every 5-10 mintues, but I never had to go more than a couple minutes without a drink before our waiter came by and refilled my drinks. He also cleared our plates with great efficiency, as every time I got up to get more food the dirty plates were all gone by the time I got back. I also loved that there was no wait as well. Some people would interpret that to mean the buffet is no good, but cmon is any buffet really worth standing an hour in line for?   Probably the weakest aspect of this buffet would be the design and decor of the place. The buffet is a bit on the small side, so it was occasionally difficult to navigate past people at different stations. They had a custom salad station where they make your salad to order, and put it and the seafood section at the front, which caused an unnecessary bottleneck. The overall design of the buffet was fairly plain as well, although they do have some window seats.  I can understand why people who came here for dinner would be underwhelmed, assuming the food is mostly the same. I too probably would be hesitant to come for dinner, but for lunch this place is worth it.",

It was time for lunch and we found the buffet and thought it would fulfill our hunger. Unfortunately, the selection of food at the Aria Buffet was very limited. $30 per person for lunch is so not worth it. There was prime rib, king crab legs, turkey, asian entrees, cereal, Mexican entrees, dessert bar, etc. I think what I really enjoyed was the only two types of dim sum they had and the asian stir fry vegetables over rice. Which brings up, while eating away, My boyfriend and I saw their chef mix a batch of eggs (maybe for their scrambled eggs?) and he turned on the sink and mixed quite a good amount of tap water into the mixture of just plain eggs. Are they serious??? So if you don't want watered down eggs, don't try it. I probably ate about $10 worth of food there. Also, on another note. I asked for a Peach bellini and the waitress had no idea what it was. She had to come back two times to ask me what it was and what was in it. It finally came out after I got my food.",

I admit that I'm picky, will only eat certain foods, and I really dislike the idea of my food sitting out for an extended period of time. I'd rate The Buffet a C-. There was no line, no flies, the alcohol menu wasn't outrageously priced, and the food was decent. I had beef (it got cold and try by the time I brought it to my table), green beans, orange chicken (again, cold), basmati rice, and flan (I think the caramel was burned because the caramel sauce was bitter). I was disappointed with how quickly my food got cold but whatever, it was all edible. I didn't go back for seconds either. I wasn't really into the selection of food they had out today and I think it takes more effort to screw up the taste of flan than making it taste good. The people I were with seemed to enjoy their food though. I don't think I'll return though, I didn't have the \"wow factor\". Oh, and I didn't like being seated with a view of the pool area. I don't want to look at people in swimwear while I'm eating, it can get quite unpleasant.",

But, overall, the hotel and casino are beautifully designed and worth visiting. The Buffet does not have the distinctive design of the rest of the venue with its cafeteria layout. The Buffet's food is very good but expensive compared to other hotels, with weekend brunch buffet costing $30, $5 more with champagne. The food selection is typical but tasty with the dessert bar being the highlight (although the dessert I had used frozen strawberries). A MAJOR warning: if you are a group of 8 or more, they add a MANDATORY 18% gratuity. I strongly disagree with this since it is a BUFFET. I realize a large group requires extra attention but since table service is basically busing plates and beverage service, 18% is excessive. An 18% mandatory gratuity brings a total champagne brunch cost for 10 people to ~$450 with tax and tip. The food is not THAT good - two stars.",

I thought the food was good and the selection was decent, but I was hoping for a bit more.  The crabs legs were pretty good, the salad bar was good and the carving stations were good (I had the prime rib and the pork loin).  I got some made to order pasta and it was not edible unfortunately.... they used way too much oil, the noodles were overcooked and the garlic was not cooked enough.  I do have to agree with the others though, the desserts were great.  They have gelato, which I thought was a nice touch.  The last and final comment was that many of the people in my group had stomach issues later that night... we're all not sure what it was that did it... but I definitely ate something that was either bad or maybe not clean??  Either way because of that, I probably wouldn't ever go back given all of the other available buffets on the strip.",

    "text": "Compared to the other buffets I ate at...Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and Wynn. I would say that this one is the best. They have a wide selection of food, and all of them are kept really nice and hot. What I would recommend skipping would be the mexican food. I've tried all the dishes at the Mexican section and none of them were good. Maybe its just me...but I would just skip it! The chinese section is definitely accurate, it's not just some asian fusion thing, but real chinese food. The pasta is also great! You choose what you want in your pasta, and they make it for you! It was very delicious..and the portion is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fhuge.So&s=1dfd765299d08f8119c18aecbeb63880a0588e7ce75777aaf062c9d6b590cc34\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">huge.So</a> I would recommend sharing the pasta with someone else so that you have more room for other food. The place is really modern, and its in a clean setting. I went for the dinner on a Saturday and it was around $25-$30..can't really remember. But I would definitely go here again seeing how the other buffets were like!",

    "text": "M'eh.  I wouldn't have chosen to eat at this buffet, but my colleague and I were exhausted after a full day at the Aria conference center and this was the only on-site restaurant that wasn't filled to capacity.  Maybe I just don't like the Vegas buffet experience.  Everyone in the place looked so sad, even as they were piling heaps of food on their plates.  It's kind of a depressing place to be.  The food was okay and there was a lot of it.  In keeping with Aria's overall theme, the focus is mostly Asian cuisine.  Plenty of sushi, curry, noodles, dumplings and the like.  Lots of seafood options.  There was also a section for southern diner-style food like meatloaf, mashed potatoes and a carving station, but none of that looked very appetizing.  It all appeared to have been sitting out under the heat lamps for a long time.  My favorite item on the buffet was the fish n' chips presented in an adorable little frier basket.  It was actually really crispy and tasted great.  Also, I enjoyed the desserts and there was a vast selection of sweets.  The bread pudding was unexpectedly exceptional.  There were about a dozen different flavors of gelato to choose from and a large assortment of pastries and tarts.  I purchased the all-you-can-drink option for... $15?  It sounds like a decent deal, but let's be honest: most people are going to stuff themselves with food and won't really have much room for alcoholic beverages.  Plus the beer list is really bad.  The only beer that I would even consider ordering was Stella.  I had one of the bloody mary cocktails too, and it was just awful.  No flavor except for an astringent, cheap vodka.  Ick.  Rather than hitting a buffet on the strip, my preference would be to take that $50-60 and catch a cab downtown.  Around Fremont Street you can eat and drink your fill of really delicious food in a much happier atmosphere, continue the revelry all night long, and still spend less money than one trip to the buffet.  That's just a personal preference though.  If you really enjoy buffets, I guess the one at Aria is par for the course.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I really liked this place that we ate here two days in a row during brunch. Brunch over the weekends cost around $30.  On the first day we ate here, we got here just before dinnertime but only paid for brunch and was able to enjoy some of the dinner foods they brought out. I was really craving some meat that day and got the prime rib. I was hugely disappointed to find that it was tough, overcooked and dry.  My favorite item was the smoked salmon.  The chicken sausage was also great; the frittata that comes in the mini cast iron skillet was okay but a bit salty. The mashed potato was plain. The eel sushi was good. My boyfriend was a huge fan of the crab legs.  I didn't try any dessert due to a gluten allergy but my boyfriend liked the pistachio gelato. When dinner came around, we heard that they had lamb leg and I got a piece of that and was disappointed yet again; it too was tough, overcooked and dry. I also got some raw oysters which were pretty good.   The next day, the line was longer when we got there but it still moved relatively fast. I tried their scrambled eggs which were bomb-diggity. I got some more smoked salmon of course, as well as the chicken sausage. They also had some cooked veggies (zucchini, yellow squash and carrots) which were great. I tried one of their proscuitto and it tasted horrible. I think I remember telling my boyfriend it tasted like soap. It was so bad that I spit it out into a napkin. Again, no dessert for me but my boyfriend liked the creme brulee.   Overall I really liked this buffet. One star docked off because of the disappointing meat and most of the items were okay, not great. But I'd still come back here if I'm ever back in Vegas.",

We showed up for a late lunch around 2:30 or so and there wasn't a line, so we were seated immediately.  There is a lot to choose from! I sampled the gnonchi with a meat and tomato sauce, several pieces of tuna sushi, California rolls, carnitas, a vegetarian salad with black beans in it, crab legs, fresh fruit, and chocolate cake.  My husband had a similar dining experience.   Nothing really stood out as excellent, but everything was good. The atmosphere was nice, and the lady who cleared the plates and refreshed drinks was on top of her game.  I'm not sure I'd go rushing back any time soon, unless I stay at the Aria again. I'm happy to have tried it, checked it off my list, and I'm ready to move on.",

We should've known something wasn't right when on a Saturday night on the weekend of CES, at 8pm, there were only about 30-35 people waiting.  Food was mediocre and maybe a step or two above Main Street Station's buffet.  1st slice of prime rib was excellent, second visit was medium well and dry (middle slice). Desserts were as unimaginable as flavorless (chocolate dipped strawberries had a waxy textured non-chocolate tasting dip, unlike Wynn's or Bellagio's).  The only thing better at this buffet versus Rio, Wynn, Bellagio is that their sushi rice was very good for a buffet.  My advice- skip this, until they re-vamp the entire buffet from chefs to the person in charge of tagging the food description on the glass above the dish with a black dry-erase marker.  Tacky.",

    "text": "During our stay at the Aria recently, we were given a $50 food credit. So, one night we decided to give the buffet \"another\" try. (The first time was a Sunday Brunch). Again, we were very disappointed with not only the lack of variety of dishes,( very limited )but with the quality as well. The crab legs were ok, but I guess they ran out of those little plastic cups for butter, cocktail sauce, etc. The carving station had prime rib and turkey....that was it. Maybe the carving guy was having a bad day, but he was the moodiest person.....cranky ol' fart. He was having difficulty slicing the prime rib and got miffed and said a few cuss words....maybe he needs a sharper knife???  The desserts looked better than how they tasted. There are sooooo many other buffets that are far better than the Aria....Bellagio's,  Rio's, Planet Hollywood. For $30 per person, I would recommend any of these, but not the Aria.",

    "text": "disappointed 2 say the least. went exactly at 11am, switching out crappy breakfast for so-so lunch. almost all the items i tried were lukewarn to borderline dead cold. Lots of items, but very few good choices. Not one great item. If I'd have 2 pick it would be the orange chicken (got the hot batch thank God) Leg of sliced lamb is o.k. (looks better than it tastes) brand-new spanking place should have great buffet but it ain't good son. They have ginger but no sushi, go figure than one out. If you like baked items such as fish, chicken, and other stuff sitting and sitting on the trays for hours drizzled in nappy heavy cream sauces, this is your paradise. Salad bar very compressed but o.k. Maybe deserts and cookies and shit are good but I dont come to buffets to eat sweets. Employees barely got the strength to assist you behind their food. One saw me at the gelatto area and just ignored me, UFB I said enough. On bright side, best buffet lemonade I ever had. 15 BUCKS FOR WEEKDAY LUNCH NO TAX/TIP",

    "text": "The Buffet at Aria is one of the worst buffets I've had in Vegas.  The crab legs where flavorless, appears they were boiled.  They serve the legs cold but will heat them up if you ask.  The sushi was terrible.  Fish was hard and the rice even harder.  Most of the foods looked dried out.  Appears that the Buffet can't turn around the food fast enough so they just leave it under the hot lights to dry out.  The naan is pretty good.  I noticed that they had the garlic naan under the plain sign and the plain under the garlic sign.  I told the chef twice they were in the wrong place and he didn't care and didn't move them to the correct place.  The best thing in the buffet is the key lime shooter.  Was some type of graham crust at the bottom of the shooter, then some tasty key lime mixture then on top was a bit of sweet cinnamon apple mixture.  You enjoy a sweet and tart key lime tastes all in one little shot glass.  Overall, don't waste your money on the Aria buffet.  After we complained about the quality of the buffet.  The waitress said that the manager was going to come out and talk to us, the manager never showed up.  The waitress was very apologetic and was very attentive (terrible food is not her fault).  Actually, I change my mind since I can't remember having a worse experience at a buffet, the Aria buffet is THE WORST BUFFET I'VE HAD IN VEGAS.",

    "text": "My first time to the City Centre. Our group decided to give Aria buffet a try since we had already eaten at Bellagio which we knew would never disappoint. Aria did not disappoint us at all. It apparently is the only buffet in Vegas that comes with a whole Maine lobster per person! The lobster isn't small either....you get one big peice and it's good. I'd have to say the best part of the buffet for me (and I'm more of an entree person) was the desserts!!!! YUM!!!!! Save room for the desserts cuz they won't disappoint. I guess the variety of the entrees/side dishes was good, but something was just missing for me and I can't quite figure it out - it just wasn't enough to satisfy my appetite which I consider huge. Other than the desserts, do try the garlic naan breads - YUM! Other than that.....ambience/service is great. It's different than the other buffets also where the food is presented in a cafeteria-style lineup. It's been 5yrs since returned to Vegas so to be fair, I can't quite compare Bellagio's buffet to Aria's although I wish I had if the distance wasn't the issue since we were hanging out at Aria afterwards. After all the walking you do on the strip, anymore walking must be deemed absolutely necessary!!! I'd recommend the Aria Buffet - you have to give it a try - it won't disappoint - it's definitely not a bad one and probably on the same level as Bellagio if not slightly under.",

I wasn't really expecting much from Aria buffet but I think the breakfast buffet is great here. I love the interior where its very modern and new and outside views of the pool bringing in the sunlight. Food wise it was a great variety. Great hot food, usual breakfast items, tasty pastry desserts, some chinese items, pizza, fruit,the carved smoked bacon was awesome... for breakfast  its a great value. Our server was friendly and cleared our plates and refilled our drinks often. I think this place is a great breakfast spot!",

I came for early dinner and it looked like most items had been left there since lunch. It could have been a slow day given it was a Thursday.   The food is organized by sections. I liked the seafood , which had crab legs , but avoid the sushi and shrimp, both were probably left too long. Indian food did not have enough flavor. The steak was hit or miss, some pieces were juicy others dry. Deserts were solid, other items not memorable.   Would not return given the plethora of other options but it could very well have been an off day for this buffet.",

It's clean, it's classy, The staff was all over our table (Not literally...), and the food was the best quality I have found at a buffet at this point in my life. Everything was cooked great and I minutes away from a food coma, I assure you. Saying I like the place would be a huge understatement.  I would personally recommend segregating your food by cultures (as racist as that might appear) simply because you get to involve yourself in a cultural experience is it one at a time, and it is so so worth it.",

Some are, which is fine but there are also single portions that are plated and garnished which I think it ten times better. I can't say I have a favorite thing here, everything is tasty! If you go for brunch they have a little bit of everything for breakfast and lunch. I like that you can that your own bread/bagels, make your own salad, they have great cheeses and meats for a charcuterie plate. And their attempt on Mexican food might be the best one I've seen at any buffet in Vegas. (It actually doesn't look Taco Bell-ish)  The desserts are fabulous and the Arnold Palmer is freakin fresh !!!!",

    "text": "They have an amusement park wait signs, advising you the duration wait time   Buffet it's pretty standard, Good variety from Carvery, Asian, Seafood, Indian, Italian, Mexican and Desert Stations, it's decent tasting, prime rib was cooked well. Not dry and actually has a nice piece of Rare to offer, which is not common at most buffet joints. Crab legs are decent not the best grade, but again buffet,  Service was good, plates are cleaned off and drinks are brought to us constantly.    Carvery station: Prime Rib Roast, Ribs, Sausage, Chicken, Leg of Lamb and basic sides of creme spinach, corn, mac and cheese, mash and baked potatoes  Asian station: Chow mein, fried rice, Pho, dumplings, har gow (shrimp dumpling), and asian server  Mexican station: tacos, tortilla and some carne   Indian station: they have a roti machine,  so they serve up some curry, masala, tandoori chick and some garlic nan (by the way pretty good).   Italian station: just opt for the fresh pasta and bypass everything else, unless you want to grab a slice of pizza. Don't use your hands please, the server will yell at you.   Seafood station: two side bar, so one side serves hot crab, mussels and vice versa on the other side, they do offer oysters as well (i made it w/out being sick) so even if it doesn't look good, consume at your own risk.  Spanish seafood rice didn't try, but looks good.   Desert station: gelato, but melts quick, macaroons, cheescake etc.   happy stuffing",

Use bigger taller glasses it will help w refilling often.   If u want a good buffet goto bellagio or cosmo.. Those r my 2 fav",

    "text": "What's a Vegas trip without a visit to a buffet? Buffets in Vegas can sometimes cost around $60 so I was stoked about this 1 that was only around $40 a person for dinner+ 18% gratuity for bigger groups. The man at the front cashier was super rude and short with me when explaining how pricing worked. Our waiter however was SUPER sweet and kind. The menu outside said they'd have ramen but I didn't see any inside the buffet. The crab pieces are small compared to other buffets. The ice cream quality isn't good. I tried the coconut and it tasted very artificial.   Things I did like: 1. Thai tea  2. grapefruit juice  3. watermelon lime juice  4. seafood curry dish  5. no wait  6. variety (ex: naan, curry, sushi, pho, prime rib, paella, pizza)  The food overall is okay. There are definitely better buffets in Vegas but all with a steeper cost.",

Three reasons: Food was incredibly bland, there was no variety, and very pricey. I don't mind paying about $50 a share if the food is good, but this buffet didn't make it for us. There is nothing special about this buffet. Save your money and go somewhere else.",

I mean it was so many sections that you don't know where to start . The dessert station was insane and the service was excellent. I been to so many buffets but the service at this particular buffet really stands out . I think the whole hotel to be honest . I got a really good vibe .

    "text": "I actually think this buffet had a good variety of foods. And I love that with a pearl card, I could get into the VIP line. The reason for the 3 stars is the service and lack of common sense by this buffet. They put out one tiny bucket of snow crab so the line is 15 mins long because after about 3 people, we have to wait for the cook to load another bowl. There were only 2 people running the seafood area and she was trying to prep everything herself. My concern is that how hard she was rushing and hurrying, she will undercook the mussels, oysters, crab. I think there is a lot of cross contamination here with raw seafood and cooked seafood. For a buffet charging almost 50 a head, it could be arranged with a bigger snow crab area. Also the server Delip in my area was such a nice guy and busting his butt. Problem is, he had no busser to  help and had a large area so we never saw him. It took forever to clear plates since he was carrying them back every trip he was making. Classy or not classy, I'm all for those huge carts that wheel back dirty dishes. Potential for workplace injury seems higher with all the physical labor involved. Why not have more bussers? A company this huge can't employ a few more minimum wage staff to help the servers? Especially on the weekend. You're doing a disservice to your Staff and your customers who wait hours long just to eat... and with all the choices out there, you'd want as many customers as possible. Also, with the huge line outside, tables were sitting empty for a while. I don't know if it is a marketing tactic to make it look busy or purely a lack of communication but again, cutting your staff short of potential income. I just felt bad for my server. The food was good. Lotsa different meats, a pasta bar, noodle bar, Indian and American cuisine.",

I enjoyed the large layout of the dining area - plenty of room for people to sit and walk comfortably. We ate as much as we could in the short time we had and it was enjoyable. The prime rib & crab legs alone make it relatively cost effective. I would like to return for breakfast because  I'm sure there are plenty of gluttonous options available.",

They serve popcorn and Costco cookies in the dessert section. It is obviously that they are highly short of staff. The Ice cream machine is partly broken. The whole place is just pathetic. Not only that it wasted our time to stand in line, and wasted our money there, it ruined our holiday mood. Aria should change the management team there or fire the cook.",

I told our waitress about my needs and within 5 minutes, the head chef came out to personally give me a tour of the gluten-free options they offered. Surprisingly, he told me he also has to eat gluten-free as well which really assured me that he would know exactly what my concerns would be. I was also pleasantly surprised to find out about the vast variety of options available for me. They had everything from personal gluten-free pizzas to gluten-free raviolis and he even offered to give me tamari for their sushi rolls if I would like.

All the meats were tough and bland. It looked like it was cooked to be rare but tasted extremely well done. The ribs were dry, the cold crab was dry, the steamed crab was extremely salty to a point that it was inedible(all the food tasted like salt overload), the fruits were not fresh, the desserts were honestly pitiful for such an expensive buffet. We had to pay the holiday price of around $52 and I wouldn't even go for the regular priced days. It was just terrible. I tried so many options and all of them left me extremely disappointed. There wasn't even a redeeming factor about this place. I barely ate and had to get good ole in n out after to fill my stomach. I recommend any other buffet in Las Vegas. I've tried the Mandalay Bay buffet a couple of times and it is superior and cheaper at the same time.",

First time there was comped by my company :D. My second visit  was about $73 plus tip on Thurs around 5:00pm (2 ppl).  There was absolutely no line which was awesome! My review is based on what I inhaled or tasted.. lol...there is so much food it's overwhelming!  But what else can you expect at a buffet.    I'm a seafood fan, and they had a good variety of seafood, such as reg crab legs (hot or cold), king crab!!!!, large shrimp, mussels, scallop ceviche, shrimp cocktail (large shrimp too!), and clams.  (During my first visit they also had oysters and lobster.)  I spent most of my time around the crab legs.. With clarified butter..yum!  The shrimp cocktails were also good, the sauce is just right, and not over-powered by horseradish.  I love Sushi!  However, the selection they had today was sub-par and not even tempting enough to taste.  Rolls I can remember: masago, California, vegetable...  As for the meat selection they had.. pork shoulder, bbq beef brisket, rotisserie chicken,  prime rib.. (I couple of other items i cant remember). I tried the BBQ beef brisket and pork shoulder.  Out of both the BBQ brisket was delish, tender, and juicy!    Other memorable items, freshly made pita bread, cheese station, Asian food station which included chow mein, beef broccoli, Mexican, salad bar...and that about it.  Love the dessert station, bananas foster had just the right amount of rum, they have a good selection of gelato, similar to M buffet.  The carrot cake was slightly dry, coconut cream cake was too sweet, and the cheesecake was just right (fora buffet cheesecake).    Overall, it's a good buffet, service was good, drink refills came in a timely fashion along with plate clean up, plus I can't complain over AYCE king crab legs... One can definitely get their money's worth on the king crab alone!",

One of the top ones was Aria, and in the description, it sang of how eclectic it is.  My fiance loves seafood, my mom is a foodie, and I get really bored easily.  This place sounded PERFECT!    The location is beautiful inside... extremely modern.  I was pleased to find an array of cultural dishes for my mom, a great deal of variety for me, king crab legs and snow crab legs for my fiance.  I read a lot of the bad reviews on here and disagree, but maybe I got lucky on the night I came, apparently you just shouldn't come here for brunch.  I enjoyed the Tandoori and the Carving Station.  They had garlic Na'an, it calls to me like the mothership.  The server was really sweet and attentive, and their coffee was even delicious.  I loved the dessert bar the most because it has miniature pies. cheesecakes, Grand Marnier cream puffs, and GELATO!  The thing about the Aria buffet is that it really is a destination... due to its location in Aria, most people wouldn't just happen across it while perusing the casino.  The lack of lines may be due to that.  I've seen an hour wait for Bellagio's buffet and I was not particularly impressed.",

    "text": "i actually do like their buffet!!! reasonable price, and you get pretty much everything you get from any other buffets! i love that they cut the king crab legs in half so lazy ppl like me can easily get to the meat... their cocktail shrimps are HUGE... twice the size of the ones i had at other buffets!!!  two other things i love , and i don't see it at any other buffet, were  - the made-to-order pasta: so yummy and fresh! i had penne w/ chicken, artichoke, mushroom in green sauce, YUMMY!  - their chicken curry w/ freshly made garlic naan: i know, who eats naan at buffet? i didn't want to but it was so good that i had to go back and get more and more!!! their naan was freshly made, and the curry has a little spice to it which makes it PERFECT!  prime ribs and chickens were good too... so does their desert bar... one thing though: we couldn't find the fruits, ANYWHERE? no fruits?!?!?!  i like that they have the restrooms inside the buffet so you don't have to go out to wash your hand (or you know... so you can eat more after you.... you know... LOL)  suggestions::: - the service was slow... we already finished our first plates and our drinks still hadn't come.... - there were a group of 10-20 DRUNK ppl behind us... cutting lines, shouting real loud, very very rude and didn't have manners at all... but the whole 30 mins we were in line, NO ONE came and said anything about it.... i understand that it's vegas and there are drunkers EVERYWHERE but that was way way way over the line.......",

    "text": "I was going to give this 4 stars because Aria comped it, but instead I give it 3, which is how I would have felt if I had paid. The buffet at Aria is a solid buffet option and should be checked out if you're staying at the hotel.   My girlfriend, parents and I checked out this buffet for the Sunday champagne brunch. The food is good, the service we had wasn't so good, though. Our waiter enjoyed talking to my flight attendant mother about the recent Steven Slater incident but he didn't see much of a need to refill our drinks. It came to a point where I gave my Dad the cup of coffee he gave me that I didn't order so my Dad could have a second cup. We're happy to socialize and discuss the issues of the day with the staff, part of the fun of Vegas is interacting with anyone and everyone around, but you still have a job to do.   Things I enjoyed: breakfast burritos, ice cream, biscuits, cheese blintzes, Grand Marnier Creme Puff dessert, all very yummy. I thought it was very cool how the desserts were so artfully presented. And to the other people who couldn't find the crab legs? How couldn't you? There were stacks and stacks of them around. The champagne was decent, too.   The atmosphere of the place is not unlike the buffet at the Mirage (my personal favorite). It has bright colors and an open design. The walls did feel somewhat sparse, but I thought the color scheme was well done. A buffet should have refreshing colors in the decor to help get your mind off of the overstuffed feeling when leaving.  Check it out if you're heading to Aria!",

    "text": "I just drove home from Vegas and wanted to give my review of Aria's buffet. We used a 2 for 1 comp here, so this made the whole experience a bit easier all around. Knowing we did not spend $35 each helped us not feel cheated. We did purchase the $12.99 all you can drink sangria, wine, and beer. I stayed with the weak Sangria as I did not want to get drunk, I wanted to enjoy the food.   I should have opted for drunk as the food was not good . There were stews (Chinese), stews (Indian) and more stews (fish, shellfish); boring, ugly and lazy for a buffet. Why have a tandoor if you are not going to cook nan to order? The nan was cold, and crisp and no one was there, at any time, to cook some up fresh. (And it appeared and tasted like the tandoori chicken was NOT cooked in the tandoor...perhaps baked?!) Sushi was stale and sloppy looking. Clams gritty. Cold prawn pasty and muddy tasting. Crab...well it was so small it was not worth the effort. Most certainly the cheapest they could find. Prime rib: flavorless (but at least there was both cream and grated horseradish). Sure there were lots of roasted meats offered on the carving stations so for some, this is a big plus, I am sure.   Other than the flirty gentleman serving ice cream everyone there seemed angry and short. No one smiled, no one was pleasant. Our waitress scored a big tip because she at least kept the sangria coming, but even she seemed ready to go home (we got there at 8:15pm for a buffet that closes at 10pm). We tried to leave with a glass of sangria, and the woman at the front almost jumped down our throats and told us we needed to drink it there. ( I have half a mind to say \"Fine, but you know what, we were told at 9:50 it was the last we could get as the bar was closing yet the \"rules\" of the unlimited says two hours. So I will sit here, and BTW, I have another 25 minutes I could be drinking.\" Mind you. we were being rushed out of the place because they were closing. yet this abrupt woman was telling us to sit and drink it. I felt sorry for those customers who were rushing to get food and did not seem happy about the closing of the buffet before being able to enjoy it. If you want everyone out at 10...then don't close at 10!!!)   Back to the sangria. We pounded it and then promptly went back to our hotel which was NOT the Aria. If I cannot take a glass of sangria I paid for,(and was being rush, in my seat, to finish before 10pm) to the casino floor to gamble, then I leave.  Bad move Aria, you lost my evening gambling money.   Can I say anything good about this buffet? Nope!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying when I booked my 4 day culinary excursion to Las Vegas, it included 2 free buffets at The Aria. That means that my friend and I had a $68 credit for the Buffet for 4 days. This is FAT BOY status...::grinch smile =). Aria also has a $12.99 Bottomless Wine, Mimosa, Beer, Heineken, Peach Bellini, Sangria, Mimosa, list is endless, drinky drink thing you can add on to any buffet. That itself is worth it's weight in gold!The flippin desserts!! They are world class! I'm pretty sure the people that make the dessert at Jean Phillipe downstairs make the desserts for the buffet. Just when you thought it couldn't get any better they add the new gelato \"wheel of fortune\" machine. I loved the Mandarin Yuzu flavor, it was a citrus explosion! Not too sour, not too sweet, and Yuzu has such a unique flavor. I destroyed the Vanilla Dulche Brownie flavor as well. Ahhh...so many flavors, so little time. Red Velvet Cupcakes, Strawberry Cheesecake with the little Aria chocolate square stuck in the middle like a ninja star, the Blood Orange Panna Cotta, The Carrot Cake, The Flan with the Raspberry on top...Raspberry plus Flan = Fireworks! My absolute favorite is the Pecan Pie. My friend's mom makes it every new year and I tell her that I will pay her for racks of this stuff, but she never believes me! Aria does not play they add a dollop of espresso, then they stack a little chocolate surfboard on top that with some gold specks. On the side of the plate is a streaky blob of caramel sauce. Heaven on earth! My slogan was Pecan Pie? Das Eriday! The Espresso takes it from great to amazazing! That is just some of desserts!  Remember there's still food! I always hit up the carving station. I just get the juicy wings off the roasted chicken and a couple pieces of brisket with some bbq sauce. Hits the spot everytime. Then I hit up the crab legs, not just crab legs. Aria knows better than that! They are pre-split in half!  So you just grab your mountain of crab and just pick out the meat. Everytime I eat crablegs, I get mad because they are not split this way. I liked the little fish and chips that came in a little fryer basket too.   I kept it simple and rotated everything that I mentioned for 3 days, the 4th day we ate at Sage. Lunch is only $23 with the bottomless drink $13. You seriously cannot beat that! Having it included with your stay is just stupid good.   Tip: If the line is long, go on the left side for Sky Suites members and you can just skip on in! Then, you can watch the line as you eat like a bowss!",

    "text": "I am going to be rather harsh in my review, although there are definite redeeming qualities about this buffet.  My cousin, his friend, and I recently visited Vegas for a quick trip.  We decided to go to only one buffet. I usually go to the The Buffet at the Bellagio, but we thought to give Aria a shot since it was a new hotel and all.  Like everything else at Aria, it was beautifully decorated with modern touches.  Our waitress was attentive and the crowds weren't too bad.  Now to get into the ONE and ONLY reason why this is a two star review:   - Holy s**t balls about the sushi.  It was like if a first grader was making sushi rice for the first time.  It was hard, under-cooked, and not sticky at all that sushi rice is suppose to be.  No one should be forced to eat things that can make your bowels run like Niagara Falls after rain.  And no good restaurant should even have the audacity to serve something like that.  On to why it's not a one star review: - Prime Rib cooked to perfection - Pasta bar that has a super nice chef ready to take your order.  (He also makes good basic pastas.) - Dessert bar to die for: Creme Brulee, Ice Cream Bar, Crisp-on-the-outside soft-on-the-inside cookies. more Creme Brulee, Oreo Pudding Shooters, Tropical Carrot Cake, and did I mention the Creme Brulee.  I don't care for Alaskan King Crab legs, but they have those as well.  I didn't have any of their Mexican or Indian wares, since I know I can get those on the cheap when I go home.  I mean chips, salsa, and guac is what you have for Mexican.  Really?  For a weekday dinner where I spend thirty dollars for a good meal, that money should have just gone to a sit down restaurant with a prix fixe meal.  That probably would have been more satisfying.",

    "text": "No bueno.  At $42 per person, totally not worth it.  We came on a Saturday night around 9 pm.  I know it's late but it was our last night in Vegas and we HAD to do a buffet before coming back home.  My sister who lives in Vegas suggested Aria.    Maybe it was the timing since this buffet closes at 10 pm but most of the items didn't taste great.  Perhaps it was because it was sitting there for a while.  We did get wine with our meals though so that was a bonus (or star if I may add).    The $42 also came with 1/2 a lobster per person.  The lobster came at the end, when my group of 6 were already full.  Since almost everyone except me were full, I scored on a full lobster!!  So I guess I may have gotten my $42 worth with 1.5 lobsters.    The lobster was small though.  It was cooked good, but SMALL.  I had a few plates of crab legs.  Did you know you can have your crab legs steamed up and warm?  I didn't know until I saw someone request their legs to be warmed.  I wish I knew that before eating my plate of cold crab legs.  The temperature made a difference!  Honorable mentions: pizza w/pesto, korean bbq, desserts and dirty plates being picked up at a decent time.  Skip out on the sushi.  Not worth it!",

    "text": "Why is it a 3 star rating!?!? I mean, I can always see why it is rated this way but it's in hindsight.   The facility is beautiful and they have a very wide selection. If you are a crab legs person, then this place is for you!!! I LOVE crab legs and whenever I see them, I tend to eat several plates. So to elaborate on these legs.... they are very fresh and warm. There is no water that leaks out of them when you crack them open. In fact, there is hardly anything that drips out. All you get is the nice warm, soft, crab meat on the inside which is not typical of the lower end crab leg buffets. They also help you out by cutting part of the crab leg shell so that it is very easy to break apart to get to the meat. This made it really easy for me to down a bunch of awesome legs before getting full. I know, I know.. I'm biased but if I had to recommend ANY buffet for crab leg lovers, it would be this one HANDS DOWN  As for the other stuff... they are decent. Just decent. I think that is why the rating dropped a little bit here. The dessert is good but not amazing. They have gelato though. However, this is probably the only buffet where my technique to get the best flavor failed. I like to ask the server for their favorite flavor or the most popular flavor. The answer I got was \"Oh... I like them all!\" My follow up question of the most popular flavor by customers from what he has seen was \"they are all good!\"...... USELESS! LOL  Anyway, it's a great place for crab leg lovers haha",

They also had foods from different cultures. They have breakfast, lunch, and dinner.Whatever you're in the mood for. I think it's worth going here than getting room service; bigger bang for your buck! There is a two hour limit. Very clean. Great service. I absolutely loved the food. You leave very satisfied.",

For starters they are very slow to seat you, even though it appeared that 1/3 of the seats were open  I thought the selection was just lacking, they had a mediterranean sections but only had dipping sauces with no pita or pita chips.  In addition they had no meats in their mediterranean sections; I was hoping to see kebabs of some sort.  Also the naan maker was broken so that didn't help their score either.    The dessert bar is actually awesome with a great selection; and is the only reason why I gave this place 2 stars not 1.     I would recommend skipping this buffet and eating at one of many celebrity chefs options in Vegas.",

I was a little disappointed with the desserts, they weren't upto par with the Bellagio's dessert selection.  I did however like the pistachio coffee cake.  There were a lot of asian selections including dim sum, chineese omellete, shrimp sushi, and spicy california rolls.  The carving stations had turkey and prime rib.  Both of which were a little dry.  Overall the food was fresh and that is mostly the reason why I give this place 4 stars.  I stuck mostly to the sea food items, which were pretty good, but limited in the choices available.",

    "text": "Since my hubs and BIL haven't been to Vegas or a Vegas buffet, I originally wanted to take them to the best buffet, but decided on this one because the cost was not the cheapest or the most expensive. Overall, I would have to say it was 'a-ok.' The quality of the meat station was impressive, but some of the other stations lacked variety. I was saddened by the Asian cuisine section because they only offered Chinese food...that really wasn't impressive. They did offer seafood, which is always a plus, a station where they make fresh pasta and a gelato bar. I probably wouldn't come here again, unless I got a free meal.  This buffet was a bit hard to find for us, since we had never been here before. But if you decided to come, make sure you go up to the second floor. It could be in the middle of the casino, there is an escalator that takes you up or from a front end, where a clothing shop is located.",

The carved turkey was overdone and dry and the prime rib was more fat than meat.   Salads were just ok nothing spectacular.  The best part was the steamed dumplings which were tasty. Dessert  selection was below average  Overall however the biggest problem was that the hot food was just not hot. Besides being less than palatable, keeping food around below 140 degrees is a health hazard and left me concerned",

Cosmopolitan's Wicked Buffet had more unique and tasty fusion selections.  I recommend the steamed crab legs and mussel soup. The crab legs are WARM, which was absolutely terrific! I couldn't believe how good they were. I hate cold crab legs. The mussel soup was slightly sweet like milk and the mussels were delicious.  Their dessert section is simple and pretty average. They have tiny whoopie pies (nutella and red velvet), several gelato flavors, and a red velvet pancake. However, I found the red velvet pancake flavorless and I wasn't that impressed with the dessert selection. However, the marble cookie is a surprise hit.  They have dim sum too, although only a few items (4-5 items). The shumai was yummy.  Stay away from the turkey bacon. Hard to chew and flavorless.  Seating is plentiful and there wasn't any line after lunch on the weekend when we went. Clean, great service, and very nice ambiance and decor.  I may return, but mainly for the steamed crab legs. That was the best thing on the menu.",

There's sign that says limit your eating to 2 hours and your stay to 3 hours.  It was very good and had lots of choices - pizza, Mexican, Indian food (wish it was not as spicy and have ways to let others spice it up), Chinese, limited sushi, crab legs, peel-and-eat shrimp, carving stations with turkey, ham, beef steamship. The salad bar was very impressive - I had read other places had very little fixings for salad on their buffets so this was the main reason we chose to eat at the Aria's buffet. The salad bar did not disappoint and there were even pre-made wedges and chopped steak salads. Lots of fresh fruit options. Oh, and dessert selection was impressive. A WHEEL of gelato, from pistachio - a personal favorite - to coconut mango and the mainstays. It was so creamy! Plus, lots of other types of desserts - nothing to complain about there! Nice, clean buffet areas and servers did a nice job of removing the plates. Just come hungry and make it your one meal of the day!",

They did have a variety of things to choose from.   I liked: cook to order pasta station (I had them make penne pasta with garlic, spinach, mushrooms, and chicken in an alfredo sauce), they had good naan and curry, cheese station, and crab legs. I especially enjoyed all of their desserts. All desserts are made in house.   What I didn't like: Their turkey from the carving station was dry. The salad bar was lacking ingredients (corn, croutons, tomato). The bread rolls were dry almost completely hard.   Restrooms: They have some for both men and women inside of the dining area. The women's restroom was clean and stocked. I think there were either 3 or 4 stalls.  Next time I will try and make it to breakfast. My brother who actually made it that morning to breakfast service said the food was much better than the lunch items.",

The lobster was fresh and very tasty albeit small. The wine was decent as well. I opted for Chardonnay because of the seafood.   The crab legs were decent but it was a pain to get the meat out so I highly suggest grabbing an entire plate (yes, entire plate) of just the crab legs first just to make sure you get your fill. The shrimp were fresh too but the 'sushi' was NOT good. I was definitely disappointed by that.  The other highlight was the New York Strip, quite tasty as well. The prime rib was good but nothing better than any other prime I've had, I'm not really a prime rib fan anyhow.  The major highlight for me was the deserts, they were all very good so it was a great way to cap off the meal. Oh, and my buddy swears he loves the pizza.  All-in-all I will not go back to this buffet but there's no reason I would tell someone not to eat here if you think buffets are logical choices for places to eat. Which, sometimes they are when cheap and decent eats are hard to come by in Vegas these days. I'd rather eat at the food court and spend my money on alcohol and clubbing.",

They had expensive meats like crab legs and prime ribs, but unfortunately they were either bland (not fresh) or overcooked/dry.  Probably because there was very few customer on a Monday night, so all dishes were sitting on the hot serving carts for a long time.  Desserts were OK - they claim to be from the Jean Philippe Patisserie but I think the quality at buffet were much inferior.   Service was good, though, and the lady at the cashier was very nice.  They did not seem to have kids price, but the lady did not charge my daughter anything.  After all, she really does not eat much (she is 6). Given the service, I think I will probably try it again if I am staying at Aria (do liked the hotel) on the weekend, when it is busier and when there are unlimited wine.",

The hostesses were not very nice or welcoming. Perhaps they were overwhelmed. Our hostess put us in a both right next to the desserts, so I felt pretty forgiving.  The big buffet feature is king crab legs, nicely split up for eating. I don't eat crab, but the many people hauling plates of it looked pretty happy. Other stations included sushi, salad, fruit, comfort food, slabs of meat, Mexican dishes, Indian food, pizza, cheese cubes, Chinese food and, of course, dessert.  I wasn't impressed with the sushi, although I do appreciate the existence of the vegetarian roll. The pizza wasn't good, either. In fact, I didn't eat my entire half slice of pizza, which is highly unusual for a pizza connoisseur as myself. The Chinese food was excellent--moo goo gai pan, steamed vegetables, seaweed salad, tofu! All of the food was fresh, delicious and labeled--no mystery items. The desserts were by far the most popular. There was a sundae bar, cookies, pudding-type desserts and tiny plated pieces of creme brulee, cheesecake, chocolate pudding and something really delicious made with nutella.  Overall, I enjoyed it. I think the $15 breakfast or $20 lunch buffets might be a better deal, but I have no complaints. Actually, I take that back. I wish there was a self-service drink station. The servers/bussers are nice, but only brought us two drinks each during the meal, even after I asked for another glass of water (it's mostly ice and we're in the desert--I'm thirsty!!!)",

It's about $5 for a small cup of gelato outside, but you can get unlimited amounts in the buffet. Three scoops is already about $15! The sushi selections are meh.. not too great. Basically Asian food is not gonna be that great. The pizza was tasted alright though!   The service is pretty nice. I had a few problems with my server this weekend though. I asked for OJ, and she forgot. I asked her again and she gave me grapefruit juice. It was bitter, but that's sort of expected since its fresh. I asked her for a coffee and she forgot again. Personally, I think she was attending too many tables that she forgets what people ask her for. So -1 star for that.  Personally I would give this a 3star rating for the price/quality ratio but it's Vegas. It's hard to find great cheap food that you would normally find in LA. I've tried many buffets in the city, but this one seems to stand out from the rest.",

It wasn't bad for a lunch buffet, lots of things to choose from and our favorites included the lamb curry and the roasted chicken.  I really liked how this buffet included sugar free desserts such as the delicious lime panna cotta with coconut.  Next time we're in town, we'll be sure to check out the advertised lobster on their dinner menu.",

I loved it. Juicy, moist, tender, flavorful...it can't get any better than that. Our waiter was really awesome she was quick on clearing plates and letting us know that each person gets half a lobster. Great lobster. It was really small though but half a lobster is good for one person. The crab legs were my next pit stop. There were two kinds: snow crab legs and king crab legs. I personally liked the king crab legs because they were bigger and they were sliced in half, so we didn't have to use any tools but our fingers to take the meat out. The legs were juicy and it had a good amount of flavor. If it's too much spray some lemon it. Another great part of the buffet is dessert! So delicious. I wanted to get everything. I had the bananas foster, bread pudding, flan, and some cheesecake. Bread pudding was good but not what I expected. I truly loved the egg part of the flan but not the sauce paired with it. Why couldn't it just be a normal caramel sauce? But instead it had an orange-y flavor. They also have gelato I can't even remember what flavor I got.   Geez what a fata$$. Whatever every bite of food from here was well worth it. I would come back for sure.  -Give it a try.   p.s.: PACE YOURSELF!",

On a Saturday night, they have some kind of special ($40) where it's all-you-can-drink wine and a whole maine lobster per two people in addition to all the food. Since we had three people, we got a lobster and a half... it was delicious. The food in the buffet was also wonderful, especially the cooked shrimp. I think all the cold (and hot) foods, btw, they can steam/heat up for you. The shrimp I loved was Asian-style with vegetables and pretty much the best thing ever. I remember really liking the cioppino, the sushi/sashimi, and pastas. I don't know why I'd ever go to another buffet...",

The other reviews are very appropriate, it is very drab and boring inside, someone said it looked like a cafeteria, they were about right. If you went for the lobster, don't set your hopes too high.

The food selections are great and always fresh.  I decided to try out the made to order pasta.  I had penne with pesto, spinach, and shrimp and it was delicious.  The crab legs were looking a lean but were still tasty.  Our meals came with half a lobster tail per person but the lobster just tasted so-so.  They have a wide and diverse selection of foods such as Asian, Mediterranean, Pizza, salads, sushi (which was kinda meh), soups, fresh carved meats, and the crab and shrimp.  The prime rib was also excellent.  The creamy horseraddish was a little powerful but good.  And the desserts, oh how I love the desserts here! They have 5-6 different ice cream flavors to choose from.  The orange sherbet was yummy coupled with vanilla ice cream.  I also tried the creme brulee, red velvet whoopee pie, strawberry cheesecake, bread pudding, and apple cobbler... All were tasty!   The server was kinda slow and it seemed like our table was covered with our used plates most ofvthe time.  It was pretty busy, so maybe they were short on staff that evening.  My family also really enjoyed themselves and the food here (their first time at Aria).  Highly recommend for tasty and fresh buffet eats =)",

    "text": "Short end of it: Save your money/calories/time!  I decided to use up some of my resort credit on this place and the only positive thing that I can say is that I was definitely not hungry after.  First of all, I am a huge crab fan. I can sit for hours eating crab. However, Aria, much like other buffet places on the strip, have found a way to totally ruin the crab experience for me. How? They cut the crab legs in half! Now some of you are probably thinking, \"this makes it easier to eat\". For a crab eating veteran, all this does is to frustrate me. Over the years, I have honed my skillz at cracking, pulling out the 'crab tendons' and then freeing huge chunks of crab that provide a great melt in your mouth feeling experience. When the crab is cut in half, the tendon is still in there and you have to scrape it off. The result is shredded crab. In addition, since they were sliced in this fashion, the meat tends to dry out....but you didn't start reading this review about my pet peeves of buffet crab, you want to know about the Aria Buffet.  The buffet is not as pretty looking as some of the other high end buffets on the strip. Someone else had mentioned cafeteria feeling, and they are right. The intent was supposed to be a high end feel, but it ended up feeling sterile, like hospital sterile.  The food was a mixed bag of foods from all over the world. Asian, Mexican, Indian (they have a tandoor oven), American.....along with some cut cheeses and meats. All the food was executed poorly. The brisket was shoe leather tough. I come from brisket country and I know that the brisket presented there was several hours undercooked. The prime rib was tender, but not very flavorful. I also would have preferred it to be more on the rare side. You already know my stance on the crab legs. The tandori chicken was forgettable (bad thing for Indian food). The desserts were pretty poor too (I will give them a pass on the ice cream/gelato/sorbet)  The whole experience made me think about the buffets on cruise ships. Cruise ship buffets can be hit or miss, but there is always something tasty to eat. I once read that the food budget for one of the mass market cruise lines is around $7 per person per day (pastries, breakfast, lunch, and dinner). Considering I just forked over $35 for this meal, I was even more depressed (I know it was resort credit, but I could have eaten at another venue for that credit).  Don't get me started on the service. All I can say is that I felt like I was an annoyance to the server. Cmon people, smiles are free and they go a long way!  Not the worst strip buffet (that goes to the Riviera), but not too far off.  So...if you are thinking about it...don't. If you absolutely need to do a buffet, try somewhere else. This is an expensive way to feel not hungry!",

    "text": "The ambiance is nice, the food is good (and the crab legs were sweet and pre-cut to you could drop the juicy crab into your mouth without any work.)   The 1 star is because of the management. The service gets 2 stars (why is it that when you have all you can drink champagne that you NEVER see the waiter!)  recap: Management: 1 star Service: 2 stars Food: 4 stars Deserts: 5 stars  We paid $23 for the Weekend Brunch (Sat & Sun 7am-4pm). It's a great food value and for another $7 you can get all-you-can-drink champagne or Bloody Mary's.   Here's the problem with The Buffet at Aria--the management is terrible and the service is mediocre. When we paid (as we walked in) we were asked by the cashier if we wanted the champagne or Bloody Mary's and a few of us were trying to decide what mood we were in.   The cashier said: \"You can choose now, and change your mind later.\" I'm sure she was trying to keep the line going. A problem occurred when a few of us \"changed our minds\" at the table and the waiter said \"No.\" We had to stick with what we originally ordered. What?  We explained that the cashier told us we could change our minds and the waiter again insisted that that was \"the rule\" and there would be no exceptions.  No exceptions. (This phrase was uttered to me six times in the next 20 minutes) We protested until it became uncomfortable and then I asked for the manager.  Again, we just wanted to switch our drink order from Bloody Mary to champagne.  The manager arrived and told us many people want to \"switch\" and it is not allowed. We explained that the cashier told us we could. And she insisted that we couldn't.   We were a table of 8, and it became uncomfortable, and so many of our friends said: \"that's ok...we'll just have the Bloody Mary. Or: you can have my champagne.\" At some level everyone just wanted to keep the peace.   I informed the woman she was a very poor manager because while I understood the \"no switch rule\", she should stand by her employee's word. (The cashier said we could switch!)  Her retort was that the cashier's were part-time employees and they didn't know what they were taking about, and she wouldn't \"honor\" their word.  In the end, after an uncomfortable and lengthy confrontation, the manager let one person switch (and warned us that she couldn't switch back.) It was ridiculous and unacceptable behavior from a manager and I was shocked. Aria should be ashamed.",

There were some good choices like the meat carving station which was pretty good and the pizza was delicious. As far as the seafood, not much to choose from. I didn't like that they only had cold shrimp and not cooked shrimp, they also didn't offer crawfish which I was surprised. The dessert section is very very limited again which was disappointing. In my opinion this buffet is overpriced for what is offered. I think if they lowered their fee's it would meet the expectation because of the limited options. Each station at most has only 6 different dishes (if that) if you want more options for your buck, try the buchannal buffet at Cesar's during lunch or wicked spoon for dinner at the cosmopolitan you won't regret it.",

    "text": "$15 breakfast buffets - I expect it from Circus Circus or Excalibur but at the new Aria at City Center?  I was intrigued and had to check it out.  There was a short line when we got there and it was moving slooooooow, but then we found it was due to a big party ahead of us and they were just in that slow moving zone.  Once they dispersed to their table, the line went quick.  We got seated and there were still a lot of tables empty so it had to have been that family that was holding up the line.  Anyway, i digress...  It must be great to be a brand new state-of-the-art casino/hotel designer and have an open budget to design to your heart's content.  I would love to have that job.  The decor was very nice but I could see it being a little dated in a few years.  It was pretty chic but wasn't cutting edge to me.  Oh well, it was nice and it had the new car smell still.  Once you get a load of the spread here, you will be wondering how they can afford to only charge $15.  You can't get that price unless you go to smaller or more remote hotels.   There are better buffets with way more selection but for more money.  Don't get me wrong, I don't mind paying more for quality, but for breakfast, I'd rather pay less for a smaller buffet with quality items and not feel like I had to eat more to cover the cost of a more expensive joint.    Really, who wants to pay $25 for breakfast in LV.  The few items that stood out for me were the selection of sausages that they had and the array of salame, olives, and cheeses they offered.  Also, their desserts looked pretty tasty and they offered a lot of sugar free options, which is good for any diabetics in the house.  One thing I would improve is the omelet bar area.  They need to provide a better area or something because the people didn't know which was the line started and they were clogging up the aisles and blocking some food areas.  The service was great.  My drinks were never empty and if they were, they always asked if we needed more juice/coffee/milk/water.    I would try this place out again, especially if I decide to stay at the Aria next time.  Seems like a nice place to crash and give my money to.  It's right in the middle of everything and there's a shuttle to the Monte Carlo/NYNY.    Worth a try.",

During the day they have unlimited champagne or bloody marys. The food is really fresh and they have it all from seafood(shrimp, crab legs, sushi, etc). I had the lamb and some spinach salad thing that was bomb. They had some good gourmet pizza too and I dont usually like that style since I am from CHICAGO orginally.  They also had some really good yogurt that really hit the spot.  The pricing was pretty decent actually not as much as Bellagio or Rio and if you sign up for the ARIA welcome package you get $75 food and beverage credit anyways so it was all free for us.  Definitely going back!",

The food was just awful and tasted like it came straight from an elementary school's cafeteria. There was nothing I enjoyed except for the decor and cool multi-color lights, and believe me I tried about 90% of the food. The crab legs were so salty I did not even need butter, and the consistency was almost like that of imitation crab meat.   To add salt to the wound, there wasn't even bottomless mimosas added to the $30 per person charge. Tisk tisk. Don't buffet managers know that in order for customers to eat crappy food, they need to be a little intoxicated?",

For under $30 for dinner, you have access to UNLIMITED crab legs. Both snow AND king. That alone makes it worth it. I had four plates of it, and could have gone on but 1) exerted control; 2) decided that I was not a pig despite appearances; 3) wanted to have a taste of something else. The meat carving section is impressive and offers prime rib, chicken, turkey, lamb and what not. I was not in a meat-y mood and just gave it a quick look but if you are a serious carnivore - that's your place.  The salads are phenomenal. Really.",

The Wine, only two choices, I got the White Wine. First time drinking Wine so I couldnt take advantage of the unlimited wine because I did not like how it tasted.  Pretty small selections, seems as if there werent a lot of selections. I mostly ate the clams/mussels and they were DELICIOUS! They had the mini salad cup things next to the mussels and they were GOOD! well the one with the crumble cheese. The crab wasnt bad it was split in half so less hassle for us. Sushi was normal. Smoked salmon tasted like ham. The prime rib was pretty good. The custom made pasta need something im not sure what, but its cool how you can customize your own pasta.  Desserts, I loved how they had chocolate covered strawberries and creme brulee. Cookies werent bad, the mini cup desserts were good.  wanted to try something new but would i come back? maybe for brunch probably there are better buffets out there.",

I find the food at buffets to be generally luke warm and dry from sitting under heat lamps all day, and the hygiene has always made me cautious. But my partner brought me to this buffet saying \"trust me, you'll like it\".  Well, the tomato bisque and the BBQ brisket were standout items for me, and I don't think I could have gotten much better at an a la carte restaurant. Most of the food was in general very good, and felt fresh and the right temperature by the time it reached my table.   For a buffet, the variety and quality was better than I expected, and I would recommend Aria to my friends who enjoy buffet dining.",

    "text": "The Buffet at Aria is not up to par with the other high-end buffets on the Las Vegas strip.  I showed up at 3:30PM the day after it opened on purpose to be able to sample their lunch and their dinner dishes.  The cost was $21.99 per person and included the usual drink offerings of soda, iced and/or hot tea, coffee, and juices.  The first action station you see is a skimpy, made-to-order salad bar where any one of three+ servers place a small variety of incredients into a mixing bowl, add the dressing for you, and place it on a plate or bowl.  It's a neat idea to have a salad action station, but this one falls short.  Do they really need to portion out romaine and shredded carrots? I asked myself.  Moving along the line, you begin to see real food, including 3 carving stations, one with turkey, one with leg of lamb, and one with prime rib--all were of acceptable quality and well seasoned.  BEWARE THE SUSHI:  the sushi was terrible!  It's essentially of the same caliber as what you would get from a low-end local supermarket and they go way to heavy on the rice and the fish is barely visible, dull and dry instead of shinny and moist..  Skip the sushi!  BEWARE THE ASIAN DISHES:  They also have about half a dozen Asian dishes laid out, including Chinese brocolli with beef in hoisin sauce, orange chicken, noodles with veggies, egg rolls, etc.  First the hoisin sauce, which might as well be called hoisin salt at this buffet becuase it was way too salty and not well stirred.  I would avoid it unless you like to have your soy sauce in a shot-glass.  The eggrolls had way too much dough and not enough veggies, and they were under-cooked.  The noodles were overcooked and the flavor was uneven from one bite to the next.  They did have some interesting Indian dishes which were well seasoned and I could even detect several layers of flavor, which does take some skill to pull off even in Indian cuisine.  They also had fresh baked garlic nam bread that they brushed with butter that I highly recommend.  The dessert station was average and included the usual tiny cakes, cheesecake, cookies, but the chocolate dipped strawberries tasted like wax, etc.   So, to sum it up, if you find yourself at this buffet, skip all but the carving stations, the Indian food, and the dessert bar.  Perhaps they're in the process of learning from their mistakes, but at this point you could take a 10-minute walk in just about any direction and have a 4-5 star buffet experience at another hotel.  I highly recommend the buffets at The Bellagio, Planet Hollywood, and The Mirage over the one at Aria and they are competitively priced.  In fact, even if they cleaned up their act and got the Asian foods right at the Aria's buffet, their cafeteria-line set up is ill-equiped to effectively compete with the competition nearby.  At its best, this could potentially become a 3-star buffet in my opinion.",

There were beautiful huge shrimp but they had no taste; same with the ceviche and sushi. The crab legs were tiny and dried out. The Indian selections were okay and the couple of desserts we tried were very nice.   However, nothing was outstanding and certainly not remotely worth standing in a one line and $47 pp.  Many cruise ship buffets do a better job than the Aria.

They have a nice variety of food there, from Asian (noodles was bomb), Italian (pastas and pizzas), to meat (lamb and roast beef?), soups, and a nice selection of desserts.

    "text": "Came to Vegas last week and decided to try this buffet out since it's at the new Aria hotel. $29.95 for the brunch buffet!? Given that it was a \"Holiday\" buffet, I don't think it was worth the price at all. What was so special about the holiday prices? Perhaps it was the king crab legs and oyster bar, but those didn't even taste fresh.   I've got a few bones to pick with this buffet: 1. I wasn't impressed with the selection of food they had. 2. Items weren't filled up when empty and counters weren't wiped down.  3. Instead of placards that indicate what dish it is, they used a sharpie to write on the glass.   For what the hotel is, I think the buffet could have lived up to it. Aria is structurally beautiful and I love that its layout is eco-friendly, but the buffet simply sucks.",

    "text": "Nothing special, but nothing terrible either. Not worth complaining about when it's comped, but I would literally NEVER pay the sticker price.  If you like Prime Rib and Beef Brisket you won't leave hungry, although at a buffet that's not saying much.   Some times the crab legs are awesome, but most of the time they just look like absolute garbage. Same with the Pizza. They used to have the greatest pesto pizza ever, but not since the remodel, which is a real shame.  The overarching theme of this buffet is probably \"unrealized potential.\" A lot of the food would be really good if made to order, but unfortunately they just make a ton of everything and leave it to sit and get soggy, burnt or otherwise go from great to gross.  The sushi, for example, is made using good fish, then put on a tray, covered in plastic wrap and left to sit in a fridge until the rice is hard and it's just garbage. Same with the burritos and the asian food. A lot of the issues would be solved, I think, if they just made smaller portions more often.  The guacamole, mashed potatoes, prime rib, basically anything that the quality doesn't go downhill when it sits out, are all amazing. Anything where the quality degrades though, expect it to be disgusting.  I just think this place is funny because they definitely have the potential to be a 5-star buffet, but they seem pretty content to be very mediocre.",

Vegan sliders, to fresh crab legs, to gumbo, to dim sum... it was all there along with SO much more. Some buffets offer a good variety of food, but the quality just isn't there... that's not the case here. Every item I chose was excellent! The dessert station here was also a step above the rest. They even had gourmet flavors of gelato including oreo and caramel pretzel. Take that, vanilla!  I enjoyed the layout of this particular buffet as well. Many are located in the center of the casino property, giving them a cafeteria feel, where this one actually had windows surrounding the dining area with nice views of palm trees and the pretty landscaping.",

I felt sorry for the people who ordered the all-you-can-drink bloody marys.  The desserts were very pretty but everything that I tasted was dull.

I have eaten at Bellagio and Caesars Buffett and this place does not compare at all. The staff is not as friendly with the exception of our waiter Randy! Randy was AWESOME! He is the reason I gave it at least one star! Some of the foods stay in a pot on top of a warmer and just get hard. I ate some crunchy tasteless fried rice today... Yuck! Beat part is the oce cream and sorbet selections. The flan was good. The rest was tasteless! Extremely too pricey for the wack selection of food. Spend 3 more bucks and go to a better buffett.

Only 1 pasta, penne with generic red sauce. The standard crab legs are skinny lower grade than Wynn's. This place is totally out of synch with the opulent, spare no expense, state of art design throughout Aria.",

However, the food didn't impress me all too much. The king crab legs were my favorite. Very meaty and cut for you so all you have to do is \"fork\" out the meat and dip it in that butter! Breakfast food and dessert are good too. But the other foods lacked a bit. The Asian section was pretty weak. Just typical fried rice and noodles, some kung pao chicken. Standard pizza. Prime rib was very salty and way too well-done. I understand Aria is still new, but I don't think it made a very good impression on my friends and I. I would only come back if it were around $20, which I doubt.",

Ok it's new and bright and all pretty looking, but at 1pm the place was only about 1/2 filled. Strange for the newest buffet on the strip.    Onto the food. Salty. Bland. Salty. Bland. Salty. I couldn't even finish the piece of prime rib cause it was way too salty...plus the whole thing was cooked to what looked like medium-well and by the time they cut the piece off, the little bit of pink disappeared and it was a nice well done. blah.  I had to laugh at the chinese bbq pork...they had a carver cutting little pieces for people. Really?   The only thing I enjoyed was the hot & sour soup. Cause it had flavor and wasn't salty.  Saving grace for bad buffets is usually dessert. Not here. Again. No flavor in anything. Oh and most of the desserts are served on these pretty plates that are really bulky so you can carry maybe three of them at the most if you stack them right. It's a buffet for crying out loud, I want to be able to load up a plate will 20 desserts to sample :o)  Ok maybe I'm being harsh. I mean I did stay out until 5:30am drinking so maybe my taste buds were dead or something.  Of our group of 7, three thought the food was good. But they were eating things like chow mein and pizza and chicken.    The only thing I enjoyed about this place was the music playing. What's not to love about eating bad food while headbanging to Lady GaGa and Beyonce.",

The \"server\" if you'd call her that was bloody awful- she literally slammed my drink on the table- is Aria telling me that there isn't talent in Vegas that actually cares about customer service? Now on to the food- pancakes were hard - yuck and also no maple syrup- only berry toppings- WTF it's a brand new hotel not the Nugget! I would choose other places over this joint for the price.",

    "text": "After reading some of the other reviews here, I almost didn't go to this buffet which would have been a mistake.  Some of the points mentioned by the other reviewers while True, don't equate to a 1 or 2 star rating.  Yes, the shrimp was located a long way from the crab legs, the Asian items at this buffet are not the greatest, etc.  buth this place serves quality food.  I found the atmosphere to be dependent on where you are sitting.  The middle area is most pleasant with the dimmed lighting.  Sitting on some of the edges may make the place seem more cafeteria like.  The Food:  I ate the weeked gourmet buffet (which costs a bit more).  They had rack of lamb, leg of lamb, sucking pig, and many more great tasting  rare items.  Even the taste and quality of the none entree items (rice, potatoes etc.) was high.  The deserts here are exceptional.  They are exquisitely prepared on small desert trays.  I tried 5-6 different items, and they were all excellent.  They also had some gelato although the selection was not as great as at the Rio seafood buffet.    I'm only giving this four stars because I have not tried  the Bellagio.  I'd say the overall quality, value, and taste is  a bit higher than the Mandalay Bay buffet (which is also very good).  I returned to the weekend dinner buffet in January 2011.  The prices seem a bit higher, but they now give you half a lobster ($5 extra for a whole lobster) and house wines with your dinner.  The various entrees and side dishes (great garlic naan) are still excellent as was the service.  The desert selections were not as large as when they first opened.",

It's actually really refreshing to not having to wait in line for buffet.  I even had to wait in line for Orleans!  Anyway, -1 star because there were no discounts for children.  ARE YOU KIDDING ME!  How is it fair that both my 4 and 6 year olds have to pay full price!  Well, we're already there and were too lazy to go anywhere else.    The waitress came over and took our drink orders (20 people).  I asked about their special guava or passion fruit drink that my friend raved about when they first opened.  She said they stopped serving that because some people were allergic to it. ALLERGIC to guava? I didn't believe that BS. -1 star.   Now to the food.  Presentation were nice.  Cooked food look decent.  My favorite was the sauteed scallops and chinese broccoli.  Crabs legs were a disappointment. -1  They were not fresh and can't compare to M Resort or Wynn.  Sushi section looked very scary.-1  They should be ashamed of themselves for calling that sushi. Dessert section was really good.  Tried about 6 different ones and they were all excellent +1.

We were told about the brunch by a good friend so we thought that we'd wait until Sunday before we left to indulge. We had checked out brunch pricing on Friday but didn't realize that there was such a significant price difference between Fridays brunch and Sunday's.  I am willing to pay a good amount for bottomless mimosas, but the bottomless mimosas were only $6 each.  Two brunch buffets $72?  Wow, shame on me for paying that.  What I will say is that we made sure to get our monies worth of that buffet and those mimosas! The buffet was well stocked but nothing too irresistible.  They had a little of everything... an omelet bar (a brunch staple), pancakes, waffles and French toast, all the eggs, bacon and sausage one could ask for.  The buffet had a salad bar, a little Mexican food, a little Chinese food, some sushi, and a touch of Italian.  The dessert bar was adorned with beautiful confections and various types of gelato.  The real star of the show were the crab legs.  Mounded high like fresh picked corn at a farmer's market, the crab was plentiful.  Served with drawn butter and lemon wedges, it was chilled and delicious.  The only thing lacking... a little crab fork. Our plates were cleared quickly and our server was friendly and generous with the mimosa refills.  We ate our weight in crab legs and drank as many mimosas as we could put away.  A solid 3 1/2 stars is what I'd give the buffet.  I may be back some day!",

There were no lines and there was an abundant amount of Crab Legs just waiting for me. Get them steamed and they're 100 times more tastier. That pretty much makes this place the great buffet it is.  It wasn't busy and about everything I ate was flavorful. Service was quick and the price was a steal ($20).  This is the buffet you should go to in Las Vegas. In the future, maybe this will change? Who knows. Oh well. At least for now, this place ranks the best in my book.",

The number one problem is most everything is cold or Luke warm. The pork dumplings, shrimp and crab legs are pretty good. For the price I think there are better choices.

When asked about it they were like \"no they didn't give me any money, I didn't know they cut.\" Spoke to manager. Food is ok, generally its a crappier version of the M hotel buffet for more money. Service good. Line cutting horrible. Not worth the price, we were comp but it would have been $36 a person.  Definitely not worth it.",

There's some really good cheesecake, a variety of ice creams, and a bunch of baked stuff that you just wanna attack first before getting towards the back.  They have a quaint selection of deli and a fair amount of MEAT in the back. Towards the center is seafood and salad and though there wasn't much of a selection for sushi, the rolls that were there were pretty good. You can also make your own salad and they even have blue cheese. (YUCK).  The one thing I was probably disappointed about that night was the tandori chicken. Otherwise, damn, that butter chicken and the naan...HELLLLLO~!   I think the quality of the food was pretty good though it can probably tear a whole in your pocket.",

    "text": "So Torn about this one!  This past weekend might not be the best indicator as I paid a $10 premium ($47.95) because it was Labor day weekend.  However, with the 37.95 price in mind, I'll do this review.  This really has only one competitor, and that is the Wynn Buffet.  Let's do a head to head with that.  Definitely a notch below bacchanal and Wicked spoons like others have mentioned.  Seafood -   The Wynn was lacking in this department.  Please see my other review.  Basically, cold king crab legs, not-so-fresh oysters, so-so sushi. The Aria did not do much better; however, they offered two types of crab legs including a cold and hot selection.  Match that with the cocktail shrimp and muscles... this round is by far in favor of the Aria.  There was a few other things but it escapes me right now. winner - Aria  Carvery -  The Wynn wins hands down - but with a catch.  They were able to serve the best prime rib i've had on the strip.  Of course, it is a little hit or miss, but the piece I received was perfect.   The Aria was terrible.  All the meats, sausages, chicken, \"new york steak,\"  and lamp were overcooked.  The cook, who i talked to, explained that the prime rib isn't cooked at the same kitchen and is kept warm under a heat lamp before being rolled out.  It explains the overcooked prime rib.  However, there was a surf and turf station so unique to the Vegas strip that it nearly pulls this one out of the gutter.  The sirloin steak is prepped separately and was THE BEST steak i've had on the strip.  Easily comparable to restaurant steak I've eaten in SF or downtown LA.   The dish alone, with the lobster topping is probably worth $15 alone.  If the prime rib was half as good as this, I'd be telling you to go to the Aria right now.  WIth that said, I don't think it was enough to pull a win over the wynn. Winner - Wynn  Variety -  Wynn had a decent variety.  I liked its unique salad creations, its variety of meats and of course its desserts.  However, it was still limited in uniqueness.  The aria had variety indeed.  It showcases indian cuisines which is pretty unique.  Their Nan bread is good and so is the humus.  There wasn't an abundance of things for indian food though.  The aria also displayed lobster bisque, tomato basil, and new england clam chowder.  I've had better clam chowder, but that's a different topic.  I would say it was on par with the wynn.  As mentioned in the carvery, the surf and turf station stands out prominently.  So for that reason, i'll give this round to the Aria. winner - aria  dessert -  Just go to the wynn.  Nothing really special at the Aria.   winner - dessert  VALUE-  Ok, so if I had 37.95 to spend... this is tough.  I would say the aria because I just expect so much more when I go to the wynn.  The service and decor is better at the Aria.  Everytime I left the table, my seat was cleared of all my previous plates.  That's impressive.  I'm also asked if I would like another \"drink\" every so often, at which point I am able to change my orange juice to a soda.  I don't often really like to keep drinking orange juice throughout the meal.  Is this really a 4 star place?  Not really, but there's enough people leaving 1 star on here that if I gave it a 4 it wouldn't hurt.  They're definitely not an AVERAGE (3 star) buffet.    Spend the extra $10 and go to wicked spoon :)",

Lots of vegetarian and gluten free options. The winner in the dessert area was the blood orange (sugar free) panna cotta. Service was great keeping your drinks refilled and plates cleared. Beautiful bright clean atmosphere and even an option for bottomless beverages for another 12.99 which includes beers, mimosas, sangrias, wine, Bloody Mary and bellinis!",

The food seemed bland and too many items are pre cooked and just sitting under heat lamps or not at all in the case of the soggy waffles! I tried the omelet station and the omelet is okay, but the beef at the carving station was tough and grisly. I don't fault Aria but any mass produced Buffett item that sits under heat lamps for awhile. As for the employees there, one was quite rude to me when I asked if they were still serving breakfast. The guy basically lectured me to open my eyes and look around. Pathetic excuse for a hospitality worker. As for the price, $300.00 was a lot to pay for 6 persons. I feel the service and quality of food is better at the Aria Cafe to which we are there twice on my trip. My personal recommendation is to dine at the Aria Cafe instead. Fresher and better quality food and the service there is better with nicer servers!",

    "text": "I'm no newbie when it comes to Vegas buffets - I've traversed Caesar's Buffet of Buffets twice. But for me, Aria's is the best! The day after I visited, I went to Bacchanal for dinner and spent the whole time wishing it was half as good as Aria  I spent an embarrassing amount of time playing and accumulating reward points on the MyVegas game so I redeemed some for a bogo offer on a breakfast or lunch buffet.   My boyfriend and I arrived around 10:15am on a Thursday. There was about a 5 minute wait. We opted for the unlimited beverages - choices included beer, mimosas, bloody Mary's, sangria, cranberry spritzer, etc. (much nicer than Bacchanal, where I had to stick to one drink!). Our waitress was super friendly (best service we had all trip) and most importantly, kept the drinks rolling!  There were a ton of choices for breakfast - traditional  options like eggs and bacon, assorted waffles , carved meats, congee, burritos, smoked salmon, made to order eggs Benedict, omelette station, etc.   We must've timed it very well as lunch items came out soon after. Lots of seafood options, including 2 types of mussels, crawfish, coconut shrimp, peel-and-eat shrimp, and fried fish. The best item, however, was the crab! I actually hate how some buffets split the legs and keep them chilled. Here, you could get them whole and warm! They did score some of the harder pieces to crack, like the claw, which was much appreciated.  After all of that and a scoop of green tea gelato, I was a happy camper, ready to gamble my savings away. I'm really over the hype of Vegas buffets, but I'll be sure to hit Aria every time I visit!  Pro tip: if you have a Visa Signature card and book your stay with Aria, you can get free breakfast buffets for 2 every day",

Over looking the expansive pool area, the dinning room is filled with light, plenty of space, and amazing 80's music buzzing softly in the back ground. It might have been Hall and Oates' fault I broke rule number one, hearing \"Kiss on My List\" my feet where moving in the trajectory of the food. I hadn't even waited for my drink order before I was loading up on a plate of King Crab legs (and a small bowl of clarified butter)! I was at least smart enough to set the legs on the table and return for a fresh plate.  Amazingly juicy steak, fresh, thick cuts of smoked bacon, omelet bar, shrimp bar, benedicts, and bacon and banana bread, oh my! My plate, already teetering precariously on a precipice of spicy house potatoes, I could only stare in awe as I walked past the second half of the buffet (YES, there was a whole other half)!! Several different scrambles, bacon, sausages, gravies, another omelet bar, and an entire lunch section of asian inspired dishes including chicken congee!!! I didn't manage to get everything I wanted, but I tasted mostly everything!  All of the food was good, solid, and sometimes actually stellar, and way above par of ANY buffet I've been to in Vegas. The hash-brown balls were to die for. The table was already loaded up with flutes of champagne (Domain St. Michelle....not bad for all U Can Drink champagne!!)! and small containers of OJ if we wanted to mix (And we did)! Our waitress was AMAZING, witty, funny and fast. The drinks never stopped flowing, and we stayed there for OVER TWO HOURS!! I needed to sit by the pool for a nap afterward! I ate my $35 and then twice as much. This is my new default brunch spot in Vegas..FULL STOP!",

The guy making the pasta was so nice and even made a half-order pasta for me. The crab is kind of too salty for my tastes but with lemon it tastes pretty good. Dessert is also pretty amazing too. Was expecting some Creme brulee for dessert but they didn't have any his time. Also love the Thai tea drink here!  Overall had a better experience than any other time here at the buffet.

Selection of food, I could be wrong but it feels smaller than most but it's fine.  I didn't want more options.  At least the options here are unique --  like artichoke dip (which was bomb), poke (which was great), pho (which was adequate), paella (which was salty).  I think a lot of things could be salted less since there's salt and pepper on the table.  Desserts, I liked the popcorn.  Limited fruit selection in my opinion.  The ice cream looked good but it was really sweet, like added sugar sweet.  I would describe it as watery sugar and flavor.  Super sad the most about this because I love ice cream and it looked great.  Line, went at 12 and it was about a half hour wake on Tuesday, we were like 1.5 line away from the cashier.    Value, for a BOGO, it's decent.  If full price, I wouldn't be as okay.  Tip, mix the horchata with the coffee if you like horchata coffee which I do.",

My family and I (7 adults $40.99 + 5 children $20.99) could have spent Mother's Day at ANY restaurant but chose to eat at the Aria, please remember that.

If you're going to stand next to my family's table and continue to stare at us, the professional thing he could have done was speak and smile.  If everyone had as much customer service as the employees at the registers I would have given four stars. I guess they have so many tourist visiting they can care less about losing a loyal local customer. Remember today in 2019, word of mouth speaks volumes.

No shrimp, 2 guys behind the counter had bad attitudes, sushi there was dried out junk. No fish offerings. The carving station had cheap beef, tasteless..My bill was $44.00 and a ripp off..Never come to this place. I won't talk about the other foods, all mostly cheap stuff..Shame on Aria...",

After using a coupon for a buy one get one free, this brought the cost down to around $40 for two people. We had no wait and were seated promptly.  My favorite stop is always the seafood section. Most notable were the hot crab legs, the oyster and clam dishes that they cooked fresh for you, and the Hawaiian poke which also was prepared fresh. I would have rated this as a five- but it still is just a step below Bacchanal in its carvery area and the oysters were limited to oysters Rockefeller and did not include oysters on the half shell. The desserts were typical of a Vegas buffet with the exception of a staff member that spent much time at the gelato display setting up labels but not offering the full selection to patrons. Service was excellent, especially considering a change in staffing from lunch to dinner.  We will certainly go back to this excellent buffet and truly enjoyed the experience.",

I am fine with that as long as the food is great but what a disappointment tonight.   No lamb Prime rib was well done Zucchini & other grilled veggies were undercooked Food was dried up from sitting too long Place was litterally empty at 530pm and sevice was nowhere to be found, drinks sat empty most of the time Waiter dropped my unused spoon and didnt bother replacing it so i got up and took one off another table Crab legs were the tiniest i have ever seen served there and i have been there around 30+ times Fried chicken should be called over cooked dried garbage chicken Sausages were dried and wrinkly from sitting too long Oysters looked so awful i am appalled they dare serve that at all  Come to think of it, nothing was fresh nor good tonight. Especially the waiter who seemed like he was having a really bad day. I sat in front of the desert area if that helps management figure out who was working. I noticed 3 tables where the waiter immediately picked up the reciept book to check for a tip and there was none to be found. Things need to change if you expect people to pay a premium and get old food and bad service with a hint of food poisoning. Especially charging \"holiday\" pricing when you don't offer anything special from any other day except a bigger bill.",

Servers on the floor and Chefs @ the food stations were rude, looks like they're way understaffed, but they sure don't like their jobs... I'm a foodie and this is probably the worst place I've ever eaten at... Food did not taste right at all, too much salt on everything, including the crab legs, it's like dipped in salt. Deserts were tasteless. To top it all, their breads had fruit flies. Not sure how this is being tolerated by MGM-Service, Quality of Food, Safety. I'm absolutely disappointed!",

I like the location on the 2nd floor of Aria. It's quieter up there away from the casino. The environment is family friendly and there were plenty of tables that had children. There is a special line for MLife members (Pearl and higher). This special line still took 15 minutes to be seated with 3 small parties ahead of us. There was a good amount of selection on the buffet. I felt like a good amount of the food I sampled was under seasoned. They serve unlimited crab legs, but only put out one pan at a time. It only took a handful of people to grab crab legs and they were gone. Then everyone else would stand around and wait (other Vegas buffets I've been to actually plate the legs for you in a line so this problem doesn't happen). My favorite item was the truffle potatoes. The desserts did not disappoint at all! I loved them all!  Service was overall good. Our plates were always cleared and our waters were never empty.",

    "text": "The Buffet at Aria is one of my new favorites. It has a lot of the same food that the Bacchanal buffet has at Caesars but it's not as pricey. Caesar's has the fresh juice and the crepes made to order but if you don't care about those items I think the food is similar.  If you are a local there is a locals discount during the week which is about $30.00 a person . The good news about going during the week is they still serve crab legs during dinner and it isn't as crowded as the weekend.   I liked the fact that during dinner you not only get the crab legs but they can make you Pan Roast (seafood cooked in a red broth served with rice) to order. They only sprinkle a little rice in it but you can add more white rice it is near the Pho. Yes there is also Pho (Vietnamese soup) for those who love soup like I do especially in this chilly weather. The Pan Roast had a nice kick to it and it was super tasty but I think it could do without this pink and white seafood block they put in it though.  They also have a Cajun type of stew with corn ,sausage , shrimp that is pretty good too. Dinner and brunch both have creative salads to choose from. My favorites contained plenty of mushrooms, beets and grapefruit.  If you are there during brunch do me a favor and get a couple of little plates of the baby clams in the garlic sauce it is to die for!! Trust me!",

I went when the Aria first opened almost nine years ago and my family was pleasantly surprised by the food as well as the atmosphere of the buffet in which won the hearts of my family.  This past week I'd re-visited the buffet to see if it was as good as I remembered and the Aria didn't disappoint!  I attempted the all-day pass that was offered and it made the whole experience pleasant. The lighting is all natural light, which is very comfortable to dine in a well-lit environment.  The food is always fresh with no food item that was disappointing.   Carving Station - Didn't try the prime rib or steak, but the pork ribs were very tasty, the sausages were also well seasoned.  Seafood - Fresh and fun to eat in mass, although getting \"sweet\" crab was a hit or miss.  Indian - Having Nan was amazing with different curry options Asian - Being Asian, I wouldn't take up space with buffet Chinese food, but the items they served were decent to satisfy an Asian food craving Desserts - The different options were delicious, although was disappointed with the ice cream selections with few fruity options.   Would definitely go to the Aria again and recommend the buffet as a cheaper but just as good option as any of the other buffet on the strip!",

Luckily, I was able to redeem a 2 for 1 deal for dinner using points from the MyVegas app. Don't waste your money paying full price here!!   **This place is not worth waiting 1-2 hours!! Find another place to eat.   PROS:  -Good juices: Horchata and watermelon juice were pretty tasty -A bit cheaper than other buffets  -Our server was kind  CONS:  -Came here for an EARLY dinner. Lots of empty tables, but we had to wait a good 15-20 minutes to get seated. Not sure why there was a wait, but the people that were walking us to our seats were SO slow. I was observing them, and they walk at a snail's pace with absolutely no rush in seating guests standing in line.   -Many of the dishes were SO dirty. I had to find clean plates from the stack. The little juice cups were even dirtier. It was hard to find clean ones. So gross!!   -I've been to plenty of Vegas buffets, and this one is probably one of the smallest ones I've been to. The selection is not great!!! I usually eat till I'm dying full, but I barely ate anything while I was here. I know seafood is a huge selling point for buffets, but I felt like the seafood selection here was meh!   -The food did not have proper signs or was missing signs. I had no idea what was being displayed. I'm reading through the reviews, and I'm seeing that this is common here.   -I grabbed a small bowl of food that was sitting under some heated lamp, and it burned my skin. I don't know how people touch the dishes at such high heat. I had to ask the worker to put it on my plate for me.   TIP- Pay extra money and eat at Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace. This place is worth the money in my opinion.",

In addition they had Thai tea and Jamaica juice that you can pour at your discretion.   For the price, I think it was well worth. I might even say I enjoyed this place more than the Wicked Spoon.

Most of the time the food is not fresh, the options rarely change (I guess that's a good thing if you want consistency). Depending on which waitress you get, getting something to drink can take a long time. Another thing that bothers me is that they make you wait forever to sit down when you clearly can see half the place is empty. This tells me they are understaffed and can't seat everyone or nobody will get drinks. So to summarize: too expensive, low quality and mediocre service.   If you want variety, then try the buffet. If you want a good quality meal, then Aria offers up some awesome restaurants like Lemongrass, Javier's and Blossom.",

The short rib with mashed potatoes is amazing, all of their meats were full of flavor and cooked perfectly, they had a salmon taco, paella, pizza  and sliders that were delicious, and their Mexican station was amazing!!!! I will say the desserts are better at the Wynn, but this is the best buffet on the trip overall right now.",

    "text": "We had a nice dinner here with four guests. We showed up at around 6PM on a Thursday and it was quite slow. I wasn't expecting too much from this buffet, but one of my favorite items, snow crab legs, were so delicious here. They have two varieties: steamed and regular (on ice). The steamed was very fresh with a hint of sweetness to it. I had so many crabbie claws it made my guests a bit concerned. But they were so good!! There's a huge pail of butter right next to it, which only added to the satisfaction.   I also had the mashed taters, succulent prime rib and pork carved offerings, in addition to the wide variety of deserts (gelato, cakes, cookies, cupcakes, flan, etc.). I didn't get to the fruits and veggies but the seafood selection was pretty good. The sushi was a little lackluster with the highlight being salmon nigiri. However, I'd come here again just for the crab legs (they also have king crab on ice), and maybe the $12.99 bottomless cocktails.",

    "text": "We went to Vegas hearing all about the grandness of the buffets. Perhaps we were expecting too much.  Instead, we came away highly disappointed.  Pros: The dining area was simply but tastefully designed. Access to food choices was ample. There were a number of food choices. The wait staff was friendly.  Cons: The attempt at ethnic foods fell flat, as the food choices per ethnic station were extremely limited (want Mediterranean? Hummus or tabouhlea (so)). The focus seemed to be on providing large amounts of seafood over any other line of food, and the sushi which I chose wasn't very good. Much of the food wasn't hot or even barely warm. Quite frankly, the salad was about the tastiest item I chose. I could get a larger food selection at Ryan's or other buffet food location. The price was astronomical for the quality and diversity received in return.  While we found the Aria hotel delightful, the Buffet? Not so much.",

I went around 7pm on a Wednesday, and paid $37. I was in the fast lane due to a pearl card so only waited a couple minutes to enter. I seriously love this buffet. In the mornings they have pork belly that melts in your mouth along with a ton of delicious options. For dinner I enjoyed some great pizza, decent sushi, some prime rib, really good creamed spinach, some great salmon, and the winner of this buffet was the beef that they had at the Italian station. (not sure exact type). One of the only downsides that I can say about this buffet is that they have crab legs which although cooked well, they are not sliced and they don't give you crackers so you spend a long time trying to get the meat out of them. I was pretty full after eating the delicious selection so I only had a couple desserts: a piece of sugar free coconut cream cake and some flan. There is a nice big gelato wheel with several flavors on it which I did not do this time, but in the past I have enjoyed the peanut butter gelato, but it was not on the wheel this time so I guess they rotate the flavors.",

For $19.99 one can enjoy traditional favorites such as eggs and bacon, along with fresh fruit, a variety of breakfast meats including pork belly, some seafood, and Asian options among others. I opted for hot tea to drink but for an additional $12.99 one can choose a \"bottomless\" drink such as mimosa. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal and recommend it to first-timers and veterans alike.",

They have your typical breakfast selection which includes cereal, fruits, pancakes, oats and they brought it up a notch. You not only have buttermilk pancakes, you can choose to have carrot pancake. They also have additional sides such as nutella.  They're brunch also includes seafood such as shrimps, crablegs, mussels, and even crawfish. I thought it was great because you get the bang out of your buck @ 9am. (Yep, came from the gym to the buffet).   I also like how they have a bit of everything from Breads, Cheese, salad, Asian dishes, Omelet bar, desserts, you name it, they have it. Don't expect a wide array of menu in each dish though. I was sorta dissapointed they didn't have macarons but its not a deal breaker for me.  For 2 people, we spent $70 including tax. It was $31+++ per person. I didn't put 5 stars because their Sunday brunch didn't include a glass of champagne or mimosa. You can order it separately but it.",

Breakfast options were out in full force, with stars being the smoked eggs benedict available made to order by the omelet station- very tasty! Also memorable were the smoked trout and lox, and I'm a big fan of peel-and-eat shrimp and the ones here were large and meaty  Appreciated that there were many healthy options available, including the salad bar, lots of fresh fruit, and various oatmeal/parfait/grits stations with additional toppings.  The charcuterie area was quite nice, too, with a variety of sausages and all of the components for an amazing cheese plate- three cheeses, two dried meats, dried fruits, candied walnuts and roasted cashews. Very classy!  Cool to see dim sum available- haven't seen this at other places but wish the selection was a little larger. Was able to have lamb shu mai, and two other mislabelled items, but there seemed to be quite a few baskets out but only a few different items.  Was a little surprised to see the carving station available at brunch- BF took advantage of the prime rib, lamb leg, and rotisserie chicken, all of which he said were great. I tried the Yukon gold mashed potatoes, which were like heaven. No exaggeration, they were amazing!  Dessert was also impressive- all made by Jean Phillipe, super tasty and beautiful presentation. Chocolate raspberry cake pop was the favorite, would have preferred other cake pop flavors rather than so many plated cake slices. Cookies were dry and crunchy, and I prefer warm and chewy, so I did not sample any. The round, spinning ice cream case was a hit with kids and adults alike.  I'm a firm believer in quality and would rather have fewer options that are better-executed than a lot of mediocre dishes out for the sake of variety, so this is a place I prefer over some others.",

Every time we asked for a refill she would yell one minute and scurry away. She didn't seem happy to serve us at all, and even sounded frustrated when she was interacting with my parents who speak English with minor accents. My mom, at one point, didn't want to even ask for napkins because she was intimidated by this server's attitude towards our table. Expected a lot better service - at least at the level of what MGM GRAND servers treat us. I would've asked to be moved to a different server's area had the Buffet not been packed.",

The tables are pretty evenly separated so that the people sitting next to you don't feel like they're having dinner with you! Honestly, it's a pretty nice space to have a buffet!   Service: 3 - Service was just okay; our server wasn't super fast or even super friendly for that matter. You could definitely tell that she was tired and just wanted to get the job done.   Food: 2 - While there was a nice variety of food, it wasn't cooked very well and didn't taste all that great. A lot of things were either dry or tasteless. Also, there was a lot of bread floating around, which I didn't like. I came here for food, not bread!!   However, I did like the crab legs, one Mediterranean dip, one Chinese steamed dish, and the strawberry gelato (probably the best thing on the menu)!!! But, I didn't like enough of anything to come back. Though, if you are looking for a really expensive cup of strawberry gelato and nice ambiance, this would be the place for you!",

I had a free dinner buffet. No lie I  was in and out in 17mins. Everything was dry, and luke warm. Even the chicken soup was cold. Its supposed to be this big fancy buffet but food, preparation, and temperature of the food served doesnt match ambiance. I hate that I wasted thousands of my players points on this waste.

I really wanted crab and prime rib but before I got to those favorites I wanted some other bites. I could go into detail and write two pages but needless to say everything was sub par. From the Asian to the desserts. The prime rib was well done and tough and tasteless  and the crab was Snow crab not even split sitting in a pathetic pan where the dogs fought over minuscule mutilated legs and claws. I felt bad for my wife. She was really looking forward to a great buffet. Take my advise avoid this at all costs. Try a real buffet like Bellagio or Bacchanal. These people or F&B Director/chef should be ashamed!!",

Granted, I'm comparing this to Cosmo's Wicked Spoon or Ceasar's Bacchanal, which can be a drastic difference. We had to wait an hour since we arrived around noon. There were actually plenty of space, but there were not enough servers, hence the long lines. All the food were typical American buffet, nothing special or super yummy. Even the international food were not as impressive either. Aside from the Mac & Cheese reminding me of my childhood days at Hometown Buffet, nothing really stuck with me. I would much rather spend a bit more money on a higher qualify buffet.",

The pasta station ran out of clean pots so they used the same pot over and over again so the pasta tasted like everyone else's. I do not eat seafood and my pasta tastes like seafood, and they ran out of chicken for the pasta. There was food all over the floors. The chair I was sitting in was so unsafe and wobbly. The poor lady sitting across from our table had her chair break on her, the leg fell off and she tumbled to the ground. Nothing was labeled so if you have a food allergy you are on your own to figure out what it is you might be eating. Not worth the price or the wait.",

    "text": "Like all other tables in Vegas, there is strategy involved when hitting the buffet.  I took my practiced hand to \"The Buffet\" at Aria last weekend when I was in sin city. It's a good choice though not the best buffet I've visited. It features a few stand-outs -- and a few misses -- among otherwise average food.  I'll get to what I liked and didn't like in a moment, but first allow me to share my philosophy on smart buffet dining.  To get the full dining experience at any buffet you need to go in with a plan. There is no wrong plan, it's all a matter of personality.  For example, the Scouters will tell you to do a walk-thru of all the counters before even picking up a plate. The Meat Heads go straight for the carving table to satisfy their carnivorous cravings and get their \"money's worth\". The Aristocrats start with courses -- maybe a hearty salad and soup for round 1, followed by the protein and carbs in round 2, and finished off nicely with a dessert and coffee for round 3.  But for me, I personally fall firmly into the Forager camp. I am curious and I like variety. I need to try as many tastes as I can in order to feel my trip to the buffet has been a success.  Therefore, I start at one end with one plate and literally take just a spoonful of each item that remotely catches my interest. I'll sit down  with a plate that looks something like this:  A small helping of a greens and typical salad toppings, two pieces of sushi, a spoonful of garlic mashed potatoes, a beef enchilada, two small spoonfuls of lamb curry, a spoon of basmati rice, some blueberries, a spoon of Mediteranean pasta salad, and a slice of lamb with some mint jelly.  To the untrained eye, my plate looks like the mess of a buffet novice, however there is order to my chaos. It's all about portion control. I get one, maybe two bites of everything. Then I can go back and try other things, or get more of the items I loved from the first round.  I'd say I got to sample at least 80% of Aria's buffet this way. Here are my favorites:  1) Leg of lamb at the carving station 2) NY Strip at the carving station 3) Shrimp Cocktail 4) Freshly made garlic naan (they even have a tandoori oven at the counter!) 5) Lychee, scallop coconut salad 6) Crab Legs (I can't eat them, but everyone at my table said they were great) 7) Creme Brulee  Things I didn't like: 1) sub-par sushi 2) beef enchilada 3) dulce leche dessert 4) not enough labels on food (was I eating lamb curry, or beef curry?)  Another part of the plan: make sure you go for brunch -- it was $26 (with tax) before 4 p.m. The prices rises to $30+ for dinner.",

They were outstanding. The boiled shrimp were fairly large, but still had shells. They had a three types of grilled/baked fish.  The pizza was the best that I've had at a buffet. It was a cross between thin crust and a regular crust.   The desserts were very, very good with unique designs. You almost have to see them, but they are all wonderful bite size desserts. These unique desserts included the Aria take on carrot cake, strawberry shortcake, and even the Oreo Cakester!!!  This buffet would have gotten 5 stars, but the salad bar was virtually not existant and the fruit selection was lacking.

The eating area reminded of a cafeteria.  I wan't expecting a fancy setting but for a hotel of Aria's caliber, I expected more.  Even though it was only 8:00 in the morning all the stations were stocked.  I started with breakfast foods: eggs, bacon, & sausages.  I was looking for an omlette station but it was not located next to the breakfast foods (what the...).  Then I tried the crab legs which are chilled.  They are snow crab legs halved.  It was more difficult to extract the meat than expected and what's worse, they were too salty.  Other food groups including smattering of Chinese offerings all looked pretty unappetizing.  I usually have a great appetite but I stopped after one serving.  In summary, this is a truly mediocre and disappointing effort from Aria.  I am not sure if I would try this even if I get comped again",

I went straight for those AND the breakfast bar was amazing.  Delicious poached eggs with the creamiest hollandaise sauce, make your own omelet station, these amazing burritos in green tortillas (I forget what it was made out of but it was SOOO good), and much more.  The prime rib was so tender, the asian griller station was okay...why is it so easy to mess up asian food?  So bland there.  I can't remember what it was, but their mashed potatoes and gravy were SO GOOD.  Who would've thought.  But I couldn't wait to get through being a good girl and eating all my food so I can hit the dessert bar.  It is truly on another level.  It would have to be the main reason I spent $25+ dollars on a freaking buffet.  The presentation is nice.  They have small flan cakes and cheesecakes on their own glass dishes, and oreo, mango and various other flavor schooners.  The lava cake is BOMB.COM, throw some raspberry gelato on top and you will surely visit heaven during you inevitable food coma.  I seriously visited the bar three times and we were sitting on the opposite end of the room.   No shame.  I would highly recommend it, but then again I have a sweet tooth, so I'm willing to suck it up and pay $25 to satisfy my sweet tooth.",

They had crab legs and shrimp cocktail in addition to other types of seafood I didn't get a chance to get to. They even had a MAKE YOUR OWN PHO station!!!!! It was amazing and I've never seen that at a buffet before (not that I go to buffets all the time). They also had an omelette station as well as pizza and an entire chinese/asian food section. I mean come on, how can you not like it? I've been to a handful of buffets in Vegas but I have to say this was one of the best (please keep in mind I don't hit up any of the extra expensive ones so this is purely compared to other reasonably priced ones). And the dessert station was also amazing with their own gelato selection as well. I can tell you for sure that I will be back to this buffet when I'm back in Vegas and I highly recommend you visit it as well!",

The only complaint I have is that we had to wait a long time even though most of the tables were empty.  Not sure what's up with that.  Also, the music was a little loud & we couldn't really hear what the person seating us was saying.",

    "text": "It's a great hotel...so why shouldn't it have a good buffet?  I was sorely disappointed. This buffet lacked selections. They tried to be different and unique, but they fail miserably. Every dish at the Aria Buffet tried to be a little bit different than your traditional Las Vegas buffet. So it sets up the expectation for more refined flavors and quality. Well,   The Indian station is interesting, but the flavors were unauthentic. The Chinese station was terrible...I'd rather eat at Panda Express! The Sushi station...ummm, I almost missed the 4 types of very ordinary and cheap rolls (and there was so much rice in the sushi that you could hardly tell it was sushi!). The \"sage\" rotisserie chicken had no flavor. The smoked pork chop was humongous...but had very little smoke flavor.  The crab legs were good, but the melted butter had no flavor. The prime rib was good (and rare!), but the whipped horseradish was terrible...there were clumps of cream...and I had to use my fork to break up the cream and mix with the pure horseradish. Really???  The desserts really piqued my interest, and since I didn't gorge on the savory items like I usually do at buffets...I had plenty of room for dessert! So here's my rundown:  -Gelato was great, but such a limited selection. -Creme Brulee was delicious! -Cheesecake was not rich enough nor was the crust hearty enough. -Sugar-free Chocolate Cake was decent...but couldn't they use some Splenda? -Cookies were so-so...I've had better at cheaper buffets.   The service was standard buffet service...not impressive. For a hotel like Aria, I certainly expected this to be a much better experience. I can easily find a better meal in Vegas for $27.99!",

    "text": "came here because we had a resort credit.  would probably not have come here without it because it would of been 45 dollars a person since it was 'holiday' pricing.  but i believe most hotels will charge alot during holiday periods.  we came at around 5pm and there wasn't a wait at all.  we also noticed throughout the night that the line wasn't that long compared to lets say the spice market.  like most buffets they have your prime ribs, sushi, crab legs, etc.  some unique stuff we tried were the dim sum, and fish and chips.  they also have a really fresh salad bar.  we both felt the quality of the food and vegetables were very fresh.  unlike most buffets where they leave a lot of old food, we noticed they didn't do that here.  as for desert, they had many selections from creme burlee to cheese cake to ice cream.  one thing we didn't enjoy was the server had too many tables to wait on and therefore it took  a little to get our drinks.  but i guess thats a management issue.  overall i would say this is a great buffet with many different ethic foods and from what we tried, the food all tasted nice and fresh.  because of the price though, i'm not sure if we'll come back for awhile since wynn, belliagio, rio, and spice market are all really good options.",

    "text": "So..we're in Vegas. Besides gambling, girls and sin---Vegas is known for its palace style buffets. We rolled the dice and decided to take a short walk from our New York New York hotel room and make an attempt to eat our monies worth at the Aria hotel buffet. The total came to over $50 for two people and we crapped out.   Aria won as we did not find a buffet fit for a king or my queen. There was a variety of global flavors: Mexican, Mediterranean, Italian, Chinese and a pitiful spread labeled American. I have to admit, I'm a bit of a picky eater and typically stick with the simple things--pizza, burgers, chicken--you know, steak and potatoes kinda guy. The pizza was dry and there was only two slices left as I approached the Italian section. There were no burgers or burger making station, that would've been neat but maybe too big an ask. The fried chicken was the highlight as it was crunchy and had a nice flavor. As good as the chicken were the mashed potatoes, problem is--I had to hold up the line scraping the last bits of potatoes from the bottom of the pot. O well, at least I should be able to find a nicely charred stake to go with my tea spoon of potatoes. NOPE. There was no steak on the buffet. No steak, that's right folks, no steak on a $20 plus/per person buffet. I had to settle for honey glazed ham--another positive element--and under cooked roast beef.   Hey, there was a great salad bar...O, no French dressing. Yes I know, I'm picky...why would I expect some odd request like French dressing.   The dessert station was quite an impressive presentation. Too bad the taste didn't quite match the looks.   If you like sea food, ignore everything you've read. There was plenty of seafood but I don't touch the stuff.",

    "text": "Originally my group stopped by the buffet for breakfast on New Years Eve and were shocked at the $30 or so price tag for their \"holiday brunch\". We decided to come back for dinner ($39.95) at the suggestion of the manager who said since it was their \"holiday dinner\" we would have options of expensive fish, lamb, and other delicacies. Our group was expecting a dinner on par with the Bellagio or at least Planet Hollywood or the Mirage. We returned later that night only to have been lied to and left disappointed.   The only \"high end\" item other than crab legs were raw oysters, which smelled terrible. I would not have chanced eating them if you payed me. This buffet had no variety. For the price inflated \"holiday dinner\" instead of giving more food options it seems they may have taken roughly half away. So much space not used or filled. There were maybe two types of sushi rolls and two or three \"Italian\" dishes, one of which was noodles with red sauce which was probably from a can. There were about 10 options for sauce in the \"Indian\" section however there were no real dishes which would have needed them.   Highlights: The king crab legs were decent,  the (overcooked) lobster bisque had decent flavor, and the overcooked prime-rib was tender. Their \"pork\" fried rice (labeled), which was actually shrimp fried rice, was actually pretty good. Creme brulee was great and some of the other desserts were not bad. The gelato was good however we ended up with options of vanilla, chocolate, mango, or lemon. Nice boring flavors to encourage you to pay $5 downstairs to get something interesting.   Failures: The  sushi was inedible. The sushi rice they used was not fully cooked. The curry tri-tip was the texture of leather. Worst miso soup I have ever had. It tasted similar to the way gym socks smell and I seemed to have inconvenienced the guy who had to serve it, as he glared at me for making him work. The asian station in general was terrible. Some of the dessert combination were very strange, which is saying a lot because I love a good gourmet flavor combination or interesting parings. The chocolate covered strawberries were tiny, had no flavor, and the chocolate was the texture of wax.   In addition to all of the food failures the actual buffet area reminded me of a cross between my junior high and a hospital cafeteria. Incorrect labels were written in black marker above the dishes and the only way to tell where certain types of food were located was is to walk around the unimpressive buffet area.   Then we have the poor planning of the actual buffet's location. Our group was seated at a booth near the buffet line and ended up with a mild case motion sickness. We noticed that the ground and chairs were shaking constantly. The table next to us took out their iphone and used an ap which measures earthquakes. This shaking was enough to register on their phone. It turns out that the constantly running tram from the Aria to the Monte Carlo/Bellagio is causing the shaking (according to our server), it did not stop for our entire meal. We ate less than normal due to the motion sickness.   Maybe this, in addition to hiking up the price for a \"holiday dinner\", removing the majority of food items, and telling guests about all these non-existent gourmet food items, is the Aria's plan to make back the money spent on building the hotel? Who knows.   Save your money and check out  Spice Market at Planet Hollywood or Cravings at the Mirage. Both are far superior for the same price. We will not be going back to the Buffet at Aria.",

There's a good selection of food (not as big as some of the other buffet spots in Vegas).  They even have already peeled shrimp!  Most buffets don't have peeled shrimp, but this place does.    Two downfalls to The Buffet:  1. Price.  I believe it was about $25/pp just for lunch alone.    2. I hate that the Aria's pool is right next to The Buffet.  I don't feel like seeing people walk out of the pool or, better  yet, wring out and dry their bathing suits next to the place I am eating.  At least they should landscape it better - maybe have some trees or high shrubbery that would block the view of the pool???  Just a thought.",

We all agreed everything we had in there was sub-par at best. I was too sketched out to eat the fish. The hashbrowns tasted microwaved, the bread was gross, the breakfast burritos were legit from TBell (red tortilla), etc. etc. The Ice cream/gelato was the best thing they had. In fact, if you like all you can eat ice cream/gelato, I'd check it out.   In my opinion you might as well spend $10-15 more for the EPICness which is the Wynn buffet.",

Everything is usually clearly marked, and kept at the right temperature.  I have not been disappointed.  I'm not sure I would pay double this amount for a lunch, but definitely worth the 2 for 1.

    "text": "Note: Unable to check-in here since it shows I'm 10 miles away??  First time a couple months ago..I had dining credits so I decided to take my mum here for a meal. The most memorable was the curry tri-tip.. mmm.   Recent experience... ECK!  This time I had two comped buffets that came with the room.  We went for brunch and found a bug in my noodle salad!! Although tiny.. a BUG with little wings and legs!   So we notified our server and he supposedly in turn notified the manager and got the chefs to throw the dish out.   About 10 minutes pass and the server came back to tell us that the dish had been thrown out. OK.   Now sitting there disgusted, with an appetite that had ran 1000 miles away and only 1/2 a dish into the buffet we waited expecting a manager to come apologize at the very least. Nope.   We ask to speak with the manager and the server responded with \"You want to see the manager? Is there a problem? Was it that LITTLE bug? (making a tiny gesture with his thumb and forefinger)\" -- YES THERE IS A PROBLEM! Just because I didn't technically pay for the brunch- because it was comped - doesn't mean that I don't want a \"refund\" for a meal I didn't eat! Thinking of the people who paid $25 for a brunch and get treated poorly. (They had no reason to believe my buffet was comped since it was charged to the room.. for all they know I'm paying for it)   So I politely although agitated said \"Yes I would like to see your manager and yes because of that LITTLE bug\". So seriously, am I only granted an apology from the manager if the bug were over an inch big or what is the rule??!!   Another 10 minutes pass and the server returns with the manager who totally ignores us and speaks to the server right in-front of our table \"Where's the bug? In the trash? Did you see the bug? so there was a bug? It was a TINY bug? What dish was it on? Are you sure so-and-so saw it?\"  WOW!  1- I thought he showed the manager about 20 minutes ago when he took my napkin in which was a noodle piece where the bug had rested.  2- I said I wanted to speak to the manager and by her actions she had no intention of speaking to me!   I interrupt their little banter of whether we were telling the truth or trying to scam them out of $25 worth of bacon and eggs. She doesn't even ask me what I wanted to speak with her about and reaches for the receipt on our table. She then says \"I don't know what I can do. It's been one hour since you started your meal\" (Yeah I spent 40 minutes waiting for your slow ass!!). But also said reluctantly that \"ok I will issue you a refund for one of your meals.\" ONE.   Although we were both only half dish into our buffet and had both lost our appetites now not only due to the little pesky bug that I had to unfortunately notice and not blindly ingest as the manager would have rathered. She would like to issue a refund of ONE meal because apparently my companion- who in his hunger finished his noodles before I saw the bug in mine - would have an appetite to continue with his meal.   I pointed out that we had both lost our appetites and hardly hate 1/2 a plate of anything and she blankly said no, she'll only refund one and walked away to process it. She came back and placed the receipt back on our table with a \"It has been refunded back to your room\", turned and walked off.   In examining the receipt.... she had refunded the full amount! WTF.....  Whatever... so we stood up, walked out and got her name at the cashier. Dree.   Honestly, it's not a bad buffet. They serve snow crab legs for brunch/lunch and king crab legs with multiple meats for dinner. Just pray that you won't have to deal with their nonexistent customer service!!   Verdict:  - Only for dinner.. their gourmet dinner also comes with 1/2 a lobster tail  - Bringing my magnifying spectacles (seriously... it will never be a comfortable meal here ever again)",

We all had early afternoon flights and planned to pass out once getting on the plane so it was best to fill our tummies before the trip home!  We paid less than $30 each for the buffet and for an additional $6 Mimosas and Wine were also included (I think). Since it was around noon, there were both breakfast and lunch items available. Typically, I don't really get my money's worth at buffets since I'll get full really fast or just am not that interested in the food, but I def got my money's worth at The Buffet! I had 2-3 plates in total plus dessert. They had all your regular breakfast items (Eggs, Omelets, Bacon, Toast, Cereal, Pastries), but they also had Pasta, Fresh Seafood, Chinese Station, Pizza, etc. I got seconds from the Chinese station, it was so good! For dessert, they had mini Flans, Apple Pies, along with some others. Their Gelatos were delicious too.   We weren't expecting much, but were surprised on how good the food was! I'd def return if I ever stayed at the Aria again.",

Even the bagels are tasteless and stale. They are tiny frozen bagels. And the cheap kind. The cream cheese is questionable. The meat at the carving station is dry. Their dim sum section used to be pretty good and was looking forward to it, but they are now disgusting. Its definitely not the way it used to be 3 years ago. The peal and eat shrimp used to be fresh, but now the shrimp are the cheap frozen kind. The soup used to taste amazing but now its just a pile of cornstarch. They went cheap on the food but kept the high prices. Even their service has declined. Everyone looks miserable. Do not spend your money here. I wouldnt even pay $5.00 for this crap.",

I tried almost everything. I really liked the chilaquiles (sort of like fried, chopped up enchiladas for those of you who have yet to try this deliciousness). The waffles, plantains, pizza, bagel and many cream cheese options were also good. There are many meat options too.   The omelets made to order were just alright. The cooks who make them are very friendly though. The corn-beef hash was not that good. Note: their yogurt is more European (sour) in my opinion.   What I really loved about this buffet was dinner. Save sixteen bucks and go to McDonald's for breakfast and come here for lunch or dinner. Lots of options (American, Korean, Chinese, Mexican, Italian, Indian) and everything tasted great. The standouts were the stuffed shells and Indian fare (chicken curry, rice, and garlic naan). I ate shells and naan until I needed to be wheelbarrow-ed out.",

We were open for anything.  We took a variety of food and were game for enjoying an array of food.  Unfortunately, half of our food was left on our plates.  Overall it was very bland.  I ended up filling up at the salad bar as my meal.   For such a grand hotel, this restaurant was very unsatisfying.

I can only assume that those who were not satisfied with food have not been to other casino buffets on the Las Vegas Strip. If you are looking to get a five-star meal at a casino buffet well then that's your fault for being disappointed. It is a buffet, and the food is mass produced. But of all the casinos on the strip, the aria buffet is by far the best quality of food. It is by far, the cleanest buffet on the strip. It is by far the best presentation of food on the Las Vegas strip. For all those people who were not satisfied with the aria buffet,  stroll over to the buffet at the Mandalay Bay hotel and casino.....Awful. Now the buffet is a bit pricey. But everything on the Las Vegas strip is very expensive and inflated. In all honesty, Staying and eating on the strip is not for families or couples who are traveling on a tight budget. But if you've got the money to spend, spend it eating at the best buffet on the strip and don't waste your money going to any other buffet because you will spend just as much for dramatically less quality.",

We come for the comfort of its nice dining area and, of course, the food. But the food is up and down, hit or miss. The last time we came in March the food was great, but this time the food was not good. There's this station that prepares fresh seafood for you or, sometimes, surf and turf, depending on the day, but this time on Father's Day, it was salmon, prawns and scallops. The salmon and prawns weren't cooked thoroughly, the core of it was still raw. I'm surprised that they didn't prepare something special for this day and at $50 per person you'd think there would be champagne included, which did occur at least one time we went there. There seems to be a lot of stations but there isn't really a great selection, we ended up eating a lot of steamed snow crab legs as that was the only thing that was adequate and a good choice for the price being paid. The dessert station is big but it lacks a rich variety. We usually end up getting the creme brulee and ice cream. And in terms of service, our waitress was on top of things and friendly.",

    "text": "Definitely one of the better buffets in town (3.5 would be most accurate for the food; 3.0 for ambiance). Most dishes are well prepared and of good quality with flavors well balanced and the selection is a bit differentiated from standard buffet fare (e.g. garlic and herb naan and pepperoni pizza bagels). We were there for the brunch buffet and my husband says the cured and carved meat selections were quite tasty and the food stations are done in a visually appealing manner.  The room is spacious and open with plenty of filtered light and view of the pool area and trees; it's part of the Aria's \"promenade venues\" and continues the theme of plentiful filtered light, modern decor and open space. Thing is though, the buffet room gets a bit too loud (compared to other buffets, such as the Wynn) which takes away a bit from the upscale ambiance the place is supposed to have.  Hint for Vdara guests: don't take the tram and try to get there via the Crystals & Aria's main entrance. There's no need to trek through the smokey Aria casino, you can just walk out the Vdara lobby, across Harmon on the walk way over the street and into the Aria lobby. Head right on the second floor; from there and it's just a couple of yards.",

The dinner must be a lot more expensive but lunch wasn't so bad. There was no line when we went, could be interpreted as good or bad, All I ate was crab and seafood. The dining side of the interior was nice, but the food side seemed like I was back at my college cafeteria.

They had all kinds of food here from Italian to Indian to American to Asian.  The list felt like it went on and on.  Again, I am not a dessert kind of guy, but wow the thing I remembered most was their dessert...(sadly I know...)  Their strawberry shortcake...OUT OF THIS WORLD! It was so flaky and delicious.  Wasn't super sweet like most places.  Just RIGHT!  Next on the list...I know I'm weird...the marshmallow! Marshmallow...really?  YES REALLY!  By far the best tasting marshmallow ever!

Service:  Friendly The staff was efficient and friendly.

Food:  Average One of the food items that other buffets did not have was the whole lobster tail.  The lobster tail was quite big; however, it was also quite chewy.  All the beef items, kobe beef steak, prime ribs, baby back ribs were all too dry and well done.  The Indian fare (tandoori beef, garlic naan) was quite good.  The dessert was great.

And although $17.95 is kinda of a lot, it's not a lot for a Vegas buffet, comparably speaking. And if you like crab legs, well that's your money's worth right there.

I could tell everything here was fresh. good quality, and clean. Wife thinks that the place deserves one star less because the choices were not as vast as the Wynn buffet, and i have to agree. But  hey...i don't need a thousand choices of beef fried rice if i get a couple great choices of cervice or italian meats.   What i think everyone has to try if they eat here.. crab legs..the best part is that they already cracked it, so you just have to pick the meat out. I know peeps that have lost teeth trying to crack crab legs and end up looking like Asian hillbillies.  Shrimp cervice. Veal Bacon. Lemon meringue Grand Marnier Cream Puff. The Flan. Fresh peeled shrimp.  There is also a great selection of italian cured meats and cheeses.",

Per our server, the tram that runs between Monte Carlo, through Aria, and then to Bellagio, runs directly underneath this restaurant.  Basically some engineer effed up.  This hotel should move the restaurant to another area of the hotel because who wants to eat while getting motion sickness?  The food was good.  Loved the pre-cut crab legs.  Loved the desserts.

It takes the mediocre elements of all of the aforementioned buffets and combined them into one. Prime rib was okay (and they were very stingy with the cuts), and leg of lamb was good but nothing to rave about. King crab legs were plentiful, but they were very dry and discolored.. frankly, not all that appetizing. The one highlight of the buffet was a salmon salad, which had lots of fresh raw salmon in it. Sadly, most of my stomach room was spent eating that salad lol.",

Firstly, if you don't like seafood don't even bother - aside from the seafood section you won't get a lot of joy out of the Asian section where you'll find seafood dishes, the Italian section where you'll find seafood dishes etc.  What food I did eat was of exceedingly average quality, with the only minor saving grace being the desserts which ranged from OK, to good.  Oh, and don't even bother with the omelette station - unless you've ever wondered what a 1 egg omelette made by someone with no idea how to make omelettes looks like.  Here's a photo of my omelette for those who need to see for themselves - <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Ffarm3.static.flickr.com%2F2715%2F4212078064_5203b6892e_b.jpg&s=068b1633484998a140b9c9ebda7059944c4900f048aab4f71cde932b4bdbec88\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">farm3.static.flickr.com/...</a>",

My young adult son and teen nephew really wanted to try a Vegas buffet, so we went. I of course made sure it wasn't a black out day... when we went to redeem them however, they had changed the black out dates and wouldn't honor them. We decided to eat any ways as time before our Penn and Teller show was running out... $159 for 3 people. The food was decent, nothing to write home about... but the really FUN part, was that all 3 of us got food poisoning. Good times sharing a bathroom to all be sick was not our favorite way to spend one of 3 days in Vegas. Don't do it.",

The buffet is well priced for being on the main strip and among other restaurants charging much more for the same or less.  While you can start with Korean hot buns, you could also choose to go for the tamales, Indian curries, or even try out their large seafood section. Myself, well I chose a bit of everything.   As for my recommendations, go for the Asian foods, cheese and sliced meat, and the roast meats section. You might as well try the seafood section while it's there, but it's not going to change your life or anything.",

Yes, the price is not on the cheap side, but Hey, you're in Vegas : If you want cheap, you'll get crap. There was a wide variety of  yummy tasting foods from all over the world around the gigantic restaurant, and I tried most of what seemed delicious.  What I prefered the most was the cheese choices and cold cuts, along with the sea counter, which was very appealing, although the salmon tartare was not very good. The seered sea-bass was Delicious ! And what about the desserts ? Divine !   Have a taste you won't be deceived !",

The only good piece of meat was the cook to order steak but it had a lot of tendons.  The Asian food was not good. The Mexican was old looking. The meat carving was dry besides some parts of the prime rib. I did like the Mediterranean hummus and cous cous.   The desserts were okay, not bad.  I definitely didn't enjoy this meal but it got the job done. Sad times.   Literally called The Buffet. I guess it's up to us to put the adjective for them. Bad buffet. Sad buffet.

The selection is okay, not as much as I would have wanted for the price. They do offer a wide range of seafood though including snow crab and king crab. So for seafood lovers, you will definitely get your money's worth if you focus on consuming your omega-3's. The desserts looked a lot better than tasted, unfortunately. I did enjoy their thai tea gelato though.  The service was great.   I would easily return for their cheaper brunch and lunch options. But as a dinner option? I would rather take my $40+ elsewhere.",

Despite declaring that some 5 of us were senior citizens and four locals, We were pleasantly surprised our bill came to less than $300 including tax and required tip.  It took a while for the servers to prepare a table for nine closer to the food service area. A female at table next to us was throwing up (perhaps, too much drinking) so we asked to move elsewhere. When the rest of our party arrived, we were all seated comfortably, hungry and ready to eat. Ruby was our server. She and the rest of crew were kind, polite and attentive. BEST OF ALL, THE FOOD SELECTION WAS AS GOOD AS CAN BE from several food stations: The stations within The Buffet include:  Fish Market: Seafood, unlimited Crab Legs, Fish & Chips  Asian: Dim Sum, Chinese, Japanese and Thai dishes  Italian: Pasta, Cured Meats, Cheeses & Mozzarella  Pizza: New York Style, Gluten Free & Stromboli  Mediterranean: North Africa and Middle East Selections  Tandoori: Indian cuisine Tandoor Oven including Naan, Tandoori Chicken, Vegetables  Latin: Mexican, South American & Spanish dishes  Carving Station: Grilled, Smoked & Roasted meats, Beef Steamship, Prime Rib, Turkey Breast  Diner: American comfort food like Spiced Meatloaf, Chicken Fried Steak, Grilled Corn on the Cobb and Giant Pancake  Salad: Choice of Salad selections  Sweets: Gelato selections, Cookies, Candies, Cakes  Add $12.99 for unlimited Mimosas, Bloody Marys, Sangria, Cranberry Spritzers, Rum Punch, Champagne, Premium Beer and Wine on TAP.  ALTOGETHER A GREAT PLACE FOR FAMILY!",

However, the flavor was AMAZING. Especially the Chinese food and Indian Curry. Except those, their fresh squeezed watermelon and lime juice was stunning! I just love here!  The service was just so so,  but I don't really care, it's just a buffet.  I'd like to go back again and again and again :)",

    "text": "This place is about as good and original as the name. Came here during the week after Christmas before NYE. Beware all buffets raise prices during this time by about 20%. The Buffet is no exception.  Nothing memorable here. The sushi is 2/5. Doesn't seem fresh and not made very well. I was worried I would get sick so I only tried a couple pieces. Looks and tastes like day old sushi. There is a variety here. The best station maybe prime rib 3/5. Mine was a bit over cooked but at least the flavor was there. Didn't go back for a second portion though. Desserts are average. They had 5 flavors of gelato. It was Ok. Nothing to write home about. The other desserts were just a little better than what you get at Hometown Buffet. Definitely not worth $48.99. Not coming here again. Better sit down options in the Aria hotel.",

At $24.99 for breakfast/lunch it's not too bad, but it's not that great. We ate here the last day of our trip because it was so cheap, but it was a bad choice because we just compared everything to Bacchanal.   One unique thing about this buffet is that they have a section of middle eastern cuisine with curry, hummus, and naan. I don't really like that kind of food though... Especially not in the morning.  There is a custom omelet bar. What I thought was weird was that there were dollar bills/tips laying on the counter. Uh shouldn't they be in a jar or something to keep it sanitary? And why are people tipping the omelet man when we already paid for our meal and that's his job...? Idk.  Cons: The bacon wasn't crispy.  Eggs were watery.  Not many dessert options.  Slow service getting drinks and refills.  Ketchup not available at the tables.   There are way better places to eat in Vegas. Don't waste your time here unless you have a good deal.",

    "text": "I hate to have to review this.. but I don't sugar coat the experience.   We had friends visiting and wanted to try out the Aria buffet. My boyfriend and I had never been there so we decided to give it a try. I was a bit embarrassed as you would think that for the price paid (it's WAY overpriced for the quality of food), the ambiance and the flair of Aria, the buffet would be dazzling and I pictured walking into a buffet that was over the top. It was far from. It looked like any buffet that you would go to downtown Fremont Street, namely, the Golden Nugget. The food looked as though it had been sitting for quite a while, not fresh and the serving stations were not very clean.   The waitress that had our table was very nice as were the greeters at the front door. I will definitely give a thumbs up. However, had I known that the buffet was less than desirable, we would have taken them to the M Resort (which has an EXCELLENT buffet for half the price! and has an outstanding seafood night), or to the Red Rock Hotel/Casino. Granted they are off the beaten path for tourists, but well worth the drive. The sad part is that tourists do not know the myriad of wonderful buffets that surround them... off the strip but yet, not a far driving distance.   The desserts were good... there was a chocolate/peanut butter dessert that was delish. So, for the dessert, I would say it was decent.   We entertain friends visiting out of town quite often and we take them away from the strip and they are amazed at how many restaurants Las Vegas has. Sadly, those that are stuck on the strip end up paying outrageous prices for food that is not the quality they pay for. So, when we pick them up, or they meet up, it's away from the strip to some great local restaurants!   Aria was a bit disappointing and hoping that the quality will get better. However, now we know, and in recommending food spots, that will not be one. NOT WORTH THE PRICE.",

We've tried MANY over the years, and 5 Vegas trips later, every single time, ARIA always gets our business for breakfast, lunch and dinner!  Chef Craig, who's name I forgot the first time I posted a review, deserves most of my credit.  He makes us feel so welcomed, and treated very special with our unique food diet.  His attention to detail and obvious desire to take care of everyone with a genuine smile, keeps us coming back to ARIA, above any other reason.  Friendly service is often rare, so we thank you Craig, and your team.  PS Craig, this is Jamison and family, the gluten free French toast fanatics, saying thank you for being so nice and so helpful.  We'll be back asap!",

The pork belly was tough and not very flavorful. All of the Asian selections were a miss. The hot and sour soup was just weird. The flavors were just a bit strange overall with the Asian food. I will say I loved the prime rib. I went back a couple of times for this. They cut it thicker than other buffets too. The pizza sitting out looked old so I didn't try it. I tried to tuna steaks, not bad. The crab legs were pretty tasty and already cracked for you. I loved the gelato bar for dessert, that was a big plus for me after eating a so so meal. We also added the all you can drink for $16.99. I had several glasses of Stella and they just kept them coming.   I really expected more from this buffet. Maybe something closer to what the Bellagio offers as far as good quality. I really did appreciate their effort here. I think different people will enjoy different food items here. Just try a lot of different foods until you find your favorites.",

I don't know if today was a one-off, but there really wasn't as much variety and quality to their selection. The comparison was huge since I started with the Bacchanal.  Everything tasted too salty, and I didn't see any bone marrow, prime rib, or snow crab legs offered as mentioned by the other yelp reviews. The plus side was that their service was good, and they did offer sugar-free and gluten-free dessert options which actually taste decent. Not to mention, it helped that there wasn't a wait to get in, since my friend and I decided to do an early dinner at 4 pm. However, overall, the food was lacking and those positive notes weren't enough to have me coming back for a while.",

The servers behind the food counters are disengaged and surly. If they answer a question, it's in clipped tones  without meeting your eyes. Our waitress only picked up our empty dishes twice.   The food was so mediocre that it should have sold at a discount, not at $33 for breakfast /brunch. How can they get cut fruit wrong? They all tasted like they were soaked in water before being brought out.   I have some advice for the management. If you want to keep the price that you currently have, you need some serious upgrades.  1. Don't hire the cheapest staff.  2. Train them in the basics of customer service or make them work behind the scenes.  3. Don't use canned soups. People can tell.  4. Don't use frozen dimsum. It's really bad.  5. Don't up charge for seafood then serve C grade product. Your shrimps were the size of a babies pinky finger.   Don't expect us back. Although we are sad about that fact. Our Vegas trips  always included Aria. Not anymore. We couldn't understand why the ratings were going down, now we know.   Oh, they also charge for parking!",

Don't get me wrong here, the place is nice, clean, spacious and bright and the dishes are nicely prepared with their own sections.   But it lacks that umph. Yes, they have every kind of similar food items served at other buffet places, and one would expect something elegant, especially located inside the Aria.

Not sure what is going on with Management because there are easily 40 to 50 tables open yet they insist on having on a line and keeping people waiting 20-30 mins to sit.  When we did get seated we were placed in the corner of the restaurant both times.  This is not to mention the fact that when you pay upfront they ask you to tip and now I'm not sure if this means if you don't tip at that time they will place you in seats at the back of the restaurant.  We had planned tipping in cash and had excellent service both times by our waiters, even though on Friday night the waiter just disappeared and never returned and nobody came to replace him.    Also don't come in the first 90 mins for brunch- they have nothing out and what is there is partially left over from the day before.  Wait until at least 8:30 or 9am.  Oh and management: how hard is it to correctly label dishes - they are sitting mislabeled for hours- this is easy!  Upper management- if you are reading this, keep a close eye on Sandra- she may be negatively impacting many of the customers by the way she seats folks in a delayed and seemingly illogical manner (corner of the restaurant near the restroom when 75% of the tables were open and remained open for the next hour?! Also she said if we wanted to have a different table we'd have to wait 10 mins, and then immediately proceeded to seat others?!)",

And usually by the time my beverage order was taken, I was almost done eating -- on at least 10 occasions.  The staff are nice enough, but clearly over-worked with too much to do.  The food for the most part was delicious with two notable exceptions that were terrible.  If you going to have a carving station, have decent meat.  At least meat that can be cut with the knives on the table.  in the 3 times I got prime rib or cowboy steak the meat was so over cooked it couldn't be cut.  And the bread.  There is no reason to not replenish bread often enough to keep it fresh.  Everything else was delicious and ample.    I wouldn't pay for it. Ever.",

    "text": "TLDR; Go eat at Wicked Spoon or Bacchanal instead :(  This is probably my least favorite buffet on the strip :( After tax and tip, dinner was $47.99. Please just go eat at Wicked Spoon for this price.  While I love the Aria, their buffet is rather mediocre and generic compared to other places on the strip. For a Sunday night, the only \"fancy\" offerings were:  Prime rib Cornish game hen Crab legs and stone crab legs - very overcooked :( Unpeeled shrimp with feet on Mussels  I'm restaurant and bar industry myself, and I guess the part that confuses me is how nothing was fresh. Everything had a sauce had a thick film or skin on top of it, no matter how much product they are moving during dinner service. I get that places that do mass production have to cook food way ahead of time, but nothing tasted fresh on a busy Sunday night, and ingredient quality is very pedestrian. You can definitely see the difference in food quality between here and Bacchanal.   If you're a drinker, they've got a great $10 bottomless drinks deal, so that might be worth your time. Definitely make a reservation if you end up here; you don't want to end up waiting in line for an hour.",

We got up to the buffet at about 2:45pm on a Friday afternoon and were not the only ones with that same idea. It was super nice to have part of the fresh dinner food they were just putting out! The drink refills were super slow, but most of the food was good. The dessert selection is very impressive. My favorite was the taco bar area they had. Wouldn't necessarily want to pay full price, but it was free for both of us so it was great!",

It was a little over $100 for the 2 of us, but that included the unlimited drinks package. The selection of food was amazing. They have a ton of seafood choices. They also have Asian, Mediterranean, Latin, American, Italian, a carving station, a soup and salad bar, and of course desserts. My favorite was the Asian station, a lot of awesome dumplings, pad thai, fried rice, and stir fry to choose from. From the Italian station, the pizza and meatballs were phenomenal. Save room for gelato and cheesecake!",

Service is not anything to rave about either. This is often the case with buffets, but at $95 + tip for two people, there are much better options elsewhere for dinner. If you definitely want a buffet, it's hard to beat the Texas Station for value if you have a car and can drive a few miles, or try the Silverton on Windmill, but Aria is really not worth it.",

Based on the food quality the correct price would be $16 a person instead tops.  But my curious mind got the better of me this time since I was wondering why there was a huge line there....well all I can say is that I got suckered but it's ok for if you don't try it yourself then I would not know.

And they charged the same price for a 5 year old kid???  It's definitely nothing special and not worth the price even with the $34.99 regular dinner price.  The food is just OK.  Buffet at Wynn is a lot better.  The roast beef was over-cook.  Grab legs were just like any other Vegas buffet places.  The only positive thing I can say about this place is the newly remodeled decor.  The environment is clean.  I will never visit this place again.  There are so many other buffet choices in Vegas that are more price reasonable with better food than Aria.  Even with my 2 for 1 myVegas coupon for dinner, it's still not worth the money.  Aria buffet, you definitely let us down!!!",

I thought that for $35 at least they would have King crab legs but nope only cheap Snow crab. Shrimp was large but overcooked. There were hardly any prepared dishes. Most dishes are combination of ingredients put together and hardly anything is cooked.  This is basically, a cheap buffet with crab legs and shrimp.  The only reason I gave it a 2 star because the deserts are better than dishes. Seafood buffet at Fremont or even Orleans beats the hell out of Aria for half the price. For around $40 (depending on a day) I can go to Universal Studios Hilton in Los Angeles and have 10 star buffet which beats them all.  Lesson learned. Never again.",

The shrimp lacked flavor, the pasta was dried out looking, the Mexican food wasn't even close to mexican, the baked potatos were hard and not all the way cooked. The only thing that was good were the mashed potatoes of the day. My husband got vanilla ice cream which tasted sour and the chocolate chip cookies were hard. Save your time and money and don't bother checking out this buffet. For the price head over to the wicked spoon buffet at the cosmopolitan, it blows Aria's buffet away. We will never eat this buffet again. Such a shame in this hotel.",

They had deserts out already and they were really good.

    "text": "Cons: Potatoes au gratin were undercooked to the point where they were crunchy. Sushi rice was stale. Crab was dried up like it had been frozen and then thawed a couple of times, and was tasteless. Gnocchi was dried up as if it had been sitting for hours. The waitress stopped by only twice the whole time, so we could only get one beverage each.  Pros: Garlic mashed potatoes were excellent. Shrimp ha gow was decent. Dessert whoopie pies were great, as was the bread pudding. The buffet was generally very clean.  Not worth the $40+ per person for dinner.",

    "text": "I was really looking forward to eating here since most of the buffets in the newer hotels are pretty snazzy. Boy, was I wrong.  The line moved pretty fast which is a definite plus for a buffet on the strip. Lunch price was $26 per person on a Tuesday. Eeks! My initial judgement was that this was not nearly as bog of a buffet line at other price comparable hotels. They have like 8 (I know that seems like a lot but it really isn't) stations. Although I really dug that crab legs were included in the regular buffet, everything else we got was mediocre, at best. We came around 1 pm which is pretty much prime time for lunch, but everything in the trays looked like it had been there for quite some time under those heat lamps, thus making everything look old and unappetizing. I made about 4 plates trying to get something I liked but ended up leaving 80% of each uneaten. Service was ok, (and we even tipped 20% in advance, something I regret) but the drink glasses were so tiny we definitely should have been checked on more than 2 times in an hour and a half.  I tried to eat the worth in dessert but that was a failed attempt in every category except the gelato bar.  I would probably never return here again, as I would rather shell out a couple more bucks for a better buffet at the hotels next door.",

    "text": "THREE STARS GUYS?? Really? Are you guys buffet snobs and know of better ones and not telling me? Because honestly, I eat, and I want to know. The M is on my list...any others? Seriously, I only eat in Vegas, so I need more to do.  But the Aria buffet, compared to the other major casino's buffet along the strip is the best one that I've had - taking into account price and quality (better and cheaper than Wynn). It was around $32 per person for dinner on a weeknight.  There's something nice about the fact that it's not just food piled on top of food, you know? Because some buffets just do that. HERE'S A BUNCH OF FOOD and it looks great for feasting with your eyes, but taste wise...eeeeeeeh.  Aria's is clean and arranged in a way where food looks delicious (and sanitary), but not in the NOW GO STUFF YOURSELF sort of way. Though, okay, the crab legs are done as such, but did you guys see the chickens? LINED UP FOR YOU! The cocktail shrimp even comes in little glass cups - but only one to a glass (wish it was at least three).  Okay, and you know how Vegas buffet sushi usually sucks? The rice is hard and cold (why would you even allow yourself to serve that?), the Aria one is actually pretty decent. I actually contemplated getting more.  The salads were creative tasted fresh. The build your own pasta was decent (if you want to try but save space for other buffet-type things, ask for half the usual amount). The seafood ravioli looks pretty average and gross, and I would have skipped it had the lady next to me not ooze about how good it was yesterday and just HAD to come back. So I tried it, and it actually tasted...fresh? Not fresh out of ocean fresh, but it was good.  I tried the Indian. They had a nice (I believe) Cantonese lady making the Indian, so while one of the dishes was great and spicy (and completely unauthentic), the chick peas were watery. Also, the garlic na'an, while delicious, did not have the consistency of na'an...more like the Chinese/Taiwanese green onion pancakes.  And the dessert. *sigh* the best part. What an amazing presentation. I wanted to try all of it. I actually did get about 8 desserts (not exaggerating) for my table of 4, and I personally did major work on all of them. They're fantastic. Great flavors, not too sweet, and not overly heavy. I LOVE creme brulee and would always get it at buffets and order it at restaurants. Until I found out how to make it. Then I just realized it wasn't worth it. But somehow, the dessert masters at Aria made it taste incredibly light for a creme brulee. My favorite, though, is the bread pudding. I just thought of it a few minutes ago, leading me to write this review. Love it! The apple crumble was not my favorite. But what I appreciated was that you can taste the real honey they used in it (probably from France, because they provided a small jar of honey from France for our tea). You can easily remedy the over powering honey in the crumble with a scoop of gelato =)  Service was a bit slow in the refilling of tea and picking plates up. Understandably, we came in about 1.5 hours before the closed, but at the same time...=T",

There was a large selection of pastries, gelato, and cakes.

It's been a while since I've been to a Vegas buffet, but it doesn't seem like a common option from what I could remember. There was a large variety of meats at the carvery including chicken, BBQ beef brisket, sausage, pork belly, pork shoulder and more.   There was different cuisines from American to Chinese to Italian to Japanese (sushi) and more. They had pretty much anything you can think of and the food was well stocked. It never seem to run out. There was also a good selection of seafood including king crab legs which were quite fresh.  The desserts were just as delicious as they looked. The small portions allowed you to try multiple ones. I had the tiramisu, flan, whoopee pie and a few others which were all amazing.  I would definitely come back. It was a great value for only $25 a person for lunch. We also had a 2-for-1 coupon from MyVegas which made it an even better value. My two friends also got bottomless alcoholic drinks for $15 each. The variety of bottomless drinks  included bellinis, sangria, different wines and beers, as well as mimosas, champagne and others.",

    "text": "I suppose if you were to compare this place to other buffets--like, say, The Golden Corral--then you'd say the food was better.  Then again, the Golden Corral doesn't cost $40 either.  And that was the price for dinner at Aria on a Sunday night.  With that, you get the buffet, half of a small lobster and apparently limitless red or white wine (though certainly nobody seemed in a hurry to offer refills).    The buffet did have an interesting assortment of items.  I saw one man attacking the crab legs and shrimp as if he had not eaten in months and we felt someone would come along at any moment and drag his food away.    The bread pudding and bananas foster both seemed pretty outstanding among the desserts.  As for the food, it seemed fresh enough.  There were several options for ceviche.  Some Chinese food.  Nachos.  Pizza.  A carving station with beef, ham, turkey, and salmon.  And an actual salad bar.  There was absolutely no item in the place that made me think \"I will have to come back for this.\"  Yes, you can eat a lot and get stuffed--but is being stuffed really the goal of eating?  There are so many other places from which to choose in the area that I'd much rather spend $40 a person and come away feeling pleasantly full and having a memorable meal elsewhere.    Again, as far as buffets go, it may be great.  I have no idea.  I'm not a connoisseur of the buffet.  As far as restaurants where you'll spend a couple of hundred dollars for a small party to eat, there are many, many better options.",

Aria is a beautiful hotel however the food at the buffet is less than stellar. Most of the food that I had was either too salty or dry. There was not a great selection of foods here to choose from. I would highly suggest that they do a food makeover of this buffet. The only decent thing they had to offer, besides the nice staff, was the desserts.

As far as the breakfast went, they had everything I can think of just about with the exception of grits( I'm not complaining though). I went to the station where you can have your own omelet made, that was very good. I love the selection of breakfast meats, bacon, sausage, ham, etc. The waffles were actually THE BOMB!!!!.    I made it a point to try every station they had, which meant I had to pace myself, and not clear my plate :0(   I did enjoy the bay scallops service. The olive tapanade from the Mediterranean station was yummy.  The sushi was flavorful, I had various ones can't remember the specifics.  Steam buns, oh yes,   I'm not a big dessert person, but I did try them, but as another reviewer stated, I was unimpressed with flavor although the presentation was pretty. I paid the extra $12 for drinks, and had the mimosas, peach Bellini's, they were aiight.  I was disappointed on the crab legs.

They had many different stations that included LATIN, and ASIAN and and AMERICAN.. haha.. and some Mediterranean style dishes and salads too. There was a fantastic salad station which had a Waldorf Sald when I visited .. I like Waldorf Salad.. and a really nice dessert bar that included a rotating Gelato bar.   In addition, since it was Brunch,. they had chicken and waffles, biscuits and gravy, pancakes to order..hashed potatoes and eggs.  I'm a sucker for Breakfast. I Brake for good brunch. I could have my chicken and waffles with eggs, Chinese-Style steamed buns and Mimosa!   Pretty excellent and I would go again if given the chance. In a sea of buffets and all you can eateries ..thie ARIA Buffet stands out for me! Happy Eating!",

    "text": "When I go to buffet's I understand that it is difficult to control quality under heat lamps and with customers constantly scooping food.  That said, when I go to  relatively new buffet at a premium hotel like Aria, I have certain expecations.  They are: 1) Clean and organized 2) better quality ingredients and preparation. 3) good service from the staff. 4) Variety  Sadly, the Aria buffet falls short on 3 of the 4 characteristics.   1) To begin, Aria is clean and organized although it uses the space poorly.  The food is categorized by food type with a round seafood section and wall hugging American, Italian and Asian sections. The Asian Section and Seafood are the focus of this buffet with several dim sum options in Asian and multiple types of mussels, both raw and drowned in broth or sauce.    2) I was very disappointed with the food quality and preparation.  The crab legs were tinier than those at asian buffets and not really worth the effort.  The muscles were varied and good and were actually the highlight but the cooked muscles were drowned in sauce and did not taste like they were properly cleaned.  The carving station had a lot of options including game hen, prime rib, flat iron steak and sausages however the prime rib was bland and the flat iron steak dried out from the heat lamps. The game hen was actually the best of the meats as the leg and thigh were most and well seasoned.   The shrimp were small, probably 41-50 count and did not taste very fresh.  There was only a small sample of very basic sushi.  The baked fish was overcooked and unpalatable.   The charcuterie was a poor comparison to Bacchanal as it contained only three types of meats to go with dry crumbly cheeses.  The meats were tough and fatty and definitely not premium quality.  I couldn't even sample the mac and cheese which was a liquid mess with the oil separating from the cheese.  The buttermilk mashed potatoes were ok.  Deserts were very good and possibly saved the evening but the gelato bar did not get adventurous in flavors.  3) The staff took forever to take my drink order, clear my plate, and refill my drink. I was able to get up, get a second plate and return and eat half the second plate before the first plate was removed.  my tea was never refilled.  4)  Very disappointing variety.  First, they bill the buffet as \"a new way to buffet\" but there is nothing new about it.  I was excited to see so many steam bins for the asian section but turned out they were doubled up and just americanized favorites such as dumplings, pork buns, shumai and the best of the bunch, the leek pancake.  They were not well cooked either.  Other than the dim sum, there were very few asian options. The fried rice was highly disappointing   The Italian section was also disappointing as it contained only pizza and spaghetti and meatballs. Other than the meatballs, which were nothing special, you could have had a better meal at Cici's.  The seafood section was great if you like muscles but lacking everywhere else.  I didn't expect 500 items but I did expect something to set it apart which I didn't find.",

    "text": "Their buffet is Superior!  Let me start by saying its worth it's price if you are hungry or had a special or it's comped during your stay. The food / service are amazing, they steamed by iced seafood which made me smile. The crab legs come in half cut so no need to fight your way from the to the claw, just peel or fork it all up. Comes cold or steamed. They have all types of food from the seafood section to like a wheel of fortune ice-crew, the sliced beef was so juicy as well and always ask for an extra slice. If the line is long and your staying there, try to go through the sky suites line and charge to your room. A little perk to get inside as the other just sit and wait, tip your mimosa cup and carry on!  Amazing feature: all you can drink beer and cocktails (picture below) it's about $15 and to start your day go to the lunch buffet and come pre-game there!",

Those snow crab legs were, hands down, the icing on top of an already great experience!  We went for brunch, both their breakfast and lunch items were A-plus worthy. They offered everything I was craving that day. The craving for eggs benedict, fulfilled. Baba ghanoush, they had it. Cannolis, you bet! They even had brussel sprouts with applewood smoked bacon, another one of my favorites. And I can't forget to mention the banana foster waffles or red velvet nutella pancakes...  For the coffee drinkers out there, their coffee is also outstanding. Far from average like every other buffet I've visited.  I'd highly recommend the buffet at Aria. They're sure to have something for everyone, you won't be disappointed.",

    "text": "Came here for a Sunday brunch after a long Saturday night. There was a line when we went, but it moved at a steady pace. I want to say we waited around 30 minutes in line with a group of 8. There was quite a selection of food; my friend said he was surprised they served crab legs. The meats from the meat station were ok, kind of bland even with sauces. In general, none of the food really wowed me; even the brunch items like eggs benedict looked uncooked and unappetizing. Saving grace for the Aria buffet? One word: GELATO. The other desserts were ok, but I could have eaten 10 cups of gelato. A coworker told me the gelato they serve at the Aria buffet is the same at Jean Philippe's, I don't know if it's True, but the gelato was the best part of the buffet. I tried pistachio, coffee, some triple berry thing, and one more fruit one I forget now. All good.   After this last trip to Vegas, I think I have come to realize that I do not like the buffets, and I'd rather go to a sit-down venue and eat/savor my food. Granted, some buffets are good, but oftentimes, I come out feeling like I just stuffed my face for the sake of stuffing my face, and that's never a good feeling. If I was staying at Aria of Vdara and didn't want to go very far for a buffet, I'd say go. But for me, I think I'll be done with Vegas buffets for awhile.",

Came here more out of convenience, didn't want to keep on looking, but at this point, wasn't aware of Wicked Spoon, but i digress.  Another justifiable reason was there were no lineups at 5:30pm on a Monday, so easy breezin.  Glad they had the crab legs, plump prime rib, and the mash potatoes, but that's about the best part.  There was congee and sushi, but didn't dare touch that.  The desserts were a bit underwhelming, though the circular display of their gelato was probably the only highlight.  Oh, the creme flan was pretty darn good.  Nice orange theme going around here, and liked the open concept here.  But can't really rant and rave for someone to return here.  $35/pp.",

They have standard fare of multi cuisines. Nothing was interesting or tasty enough to go back for a second. They had lobster and crab, so I can't comment on how that tasted since I don't eat that! Their desserts were plain, not necessarily special or tasty or unique. Would not come back! Too many better choices in Vegas!",

The buffet was on the smaller side but it had a lot of good food to choose from. There's a huge seafood bar which has king crab legs, snow crab legs, oysters, mussels, shrimp, ceviche, salmon and tuna poke and cioppino. There's also a small cheese station, pasta station, asian station and meat station. My favorites were the king crab legs, har gow (dim sum), salmon/tuna poke, prime rib, and cheesecake. Aria buffet also had an extensive dessert bar. I love their panna cotta and cookies! Service was good and our table was clean and spacious. Overall, a good buffet but not as grand as wicked spoon.",

I came for lunch on a Monday at noon because I am staying in the hotel and it's absolutely terrible! I never write reviews, but if I can help some people save the disappointment and the money here it is... The crab legs don't even taste good hot or cold. Nothing here has flavor: the butter for crab legs has no flavor, the dang cocktail sauce for the shrimp tastes off it's literally freaking horseradish mixed with ketchup that's how easy it is to make... the hummus tastes like nothing, the Chinese dim sum was nasty, the carved beef was rubbery and tasteless. I wasn't impressed with one item here... maybe my Coke... my server was very nice, but the food was garbage. The desserts look good and once again garbage. How do you mess up a rice krispy treat? It's  literally butter and rice krispy's and boom delicious... Don't even bother looking at the sushi unless you like air dried out raw fish that looks like a pre-k art project same goes for the pre-made salads I wouldn't even touch because they looked so old that the film was starting to take place from being stationary too long.

    "text": "What has happened to the Aria Buffet?  My partner and I have dined here on several dozen occasions over the past 2+ years, and we've seen it slowly go downhill. We are MLife Platinum members and frequent the Aria Casino regularly. Recently, it's been just hit-or-miss.  What a disappointment on Easter Sunday dinner at 7:30pm, when they do an extra surcharge at $47.99 per person, plus tax. I was expecting they could do a little better on a \"holiday\". Foremost in our minds was the decision to remove the made-to-order pasta station, which my partner enjoyed on almost every occasion previously. Now, in its place, there's just a lonely Pho station, which does not look appetizing and from which no one orders. It's confusing what exactly it even is.  The deli meats used to include high end selections- delicious salami and prosciutto. Now, it looks like thin slices of turkey, ham, and roast beef. They have even cut down on the cheese selection, no longer serving mozzarella, dried apricots, various nuts, or the flatbreads and breadsticks which used to accompany the spread on a daily basis.  The carving station used to have roasted vegetables- carrots, onion, purple cauliflower, butternut squash, and zucchini. This time-ONLY yellow zucchini.   In addition, some of our favorite classic selections have been ruined--Mac and Cheese is now Lobster Mac and cheese, Plain vegetable fried rice is now Shrimp fried rice. Not for vegetarians...  The Aria Buffet used to be amazing- a great and vast selection of food. I used to rave about it and recommend it left and right. We loved the Raspberry and Apricot Rugelach from the dessert station, which is unfortunately never served anymore.  Also, during our most recent visit, my partner went to the dessert station for a chocolate chip cookie. He returned for another one and saw an employee taking about 10 remaining cookies and packing them up. If there's only ten left, why not allow customers to finish them? Very perplexing.  My partner actually left hungry because he couldn't find anything appetizing. At $200 for a party of four, we truly felt we did not get our money's worth, and do not plan on returning any time in the near future.",

It's not very big like most Vegas buffets. The selection of food was also not a lot as well. I really didn't like how things were set up. It was all kind of bunched up together. Like the center counters, one side would be hot food and the other side would be crab legs. The set up just wasn't all that easy. Presentation was just ok. It kind of mimicked the Wicked Spoon with some of the trays items were put in. And the salad bar! Most people get excited for the crab legs and prime ribs. I get excited about the salad bar. The more toppings the better. But if you put the toppings in a jar, how the heck am I suppose to grab them quickly? It wasn't easy reaching towards the back of the bar.  The quality of the food wasn't the best either. I don't think I ate that much at this buffet. I didn't find anything that was amazing. And because it's so small the wait was longer for large parties of 5 and up.",

    "text": "My family just finished a weekend stay at Aria with three suites for a family of 6 adults and 6 kids (ages 3 through 7).   The only problem with our stay was the Aria buffet.    We had dinner on Sunday night.  Price was $52 per person for everyone.  $52 per person, whether adult or kid!!!!  Only the 3-year old was free.  The remaining 5 kids, ages 4-7, each cost $52.     The cashier, Paul, had a bad attitude and messed up our billing.   He originally charged $52 per person (gratuity already included per person for our large party).   After he charged 2 of our credit cards for the group, we asked him about the kids prices.   When he found out one of them was 3 years and should've been free, he gave us an attitude like it was our fault for not telling him up front.   Then the bad attitude continued as he tried to figure out how to give $52 back.  The whole line got held up because of his mistake, yet people were looking my family like it was our fault.   So then we get to our table, and we get a waiter who was pretty inattentive.   We weren't eating and drinking at a very fast rate at all.  But we still had to wait for extended times to get drink refills and plates cleared.    The food was OK, not worth $52.   Dim sum containers had nothing in them.  The available tuna sushi looked old and dry.  The warm steamed crab legs were a pile of broken unappetizing looking legs.     Good news is the oysters were good.  So was the prime rib.   Otherwise, hit and miss on the dishes offered at Aria.   As far as I'm concerned, it's better to pay up more and get amazing food and service upstairs at Carbone, or else get the overpriced pizza at Slaters or $10-12 burgers at the burger place.    The crazy thing is that you would think the $52 buffet price point would weed out some of the jackass patrons.  But it didn't.  There were idiot diners who took serving tongs and spoons from one dish to scoop out food from other nearby dishes.   There were also gluttons who did things like hoard oysters and crab legs on multiple plates at a time, leaving nothing for anyone else.    I'm not dinging Aria for the idiot eaters.   But as far as the price, value, cashier and waiter service, $52 is not worth it all.   If you really want a buffet, go somewhere else.",

The staff was nice and everything was clean.   The meat station was pretty good. The usual suspects; Prime Rib, Ham, Roasted Chicken, Smoked Sausage and a Beef Brisket or Roast maybe. They called it Steamship. It was all really good, juicy and tender. We went on Sat night so they also had a Steak Station. The were grilling custom ordered Sirloins. While I usually don't care for a Sirloin, I gave it a try and it was good! Tender, juicy, flavorful and cooked perfectly!   The salad bar and the vegetable selection was a little lacking but what they had was good. I tried the Mac and Cheese, excellent! For a buffet especially. The Tamales were also very good and tasted fresh made. I'll say this, it's the first buffet I've been to in Las Vegas where everything tastes fresh made. I didn't taste anything that was bland or dried out.   They also served seafood! Cold Alaskan King Crab, split and oysters and such. Warm sweet Snow Crab, cracked and a few fish dishes and muscles dishes. I only tried the crab but it was delicious! The Snow Crab was super sweet and came out of the shell easily. They come cracked so that helps. The bins were always full, no lines.  And the best part was the dessert!! Let me say again, buffet desserts are usually bland and dry bits of cardboard but this buffet....holy smokes! Every single thing I tried tasted moist, delicious and fresh made.   I posted pics, check them out. Over all, great meal worth $30 for sure. We'll be back!",

The buffet promised a brunch style but was definitely a miss on several levels.  Although we were one of the first customers, many of the food items were already \"old\" and inedible.  They had already been sitting out too long or were reused from the previous day.  The selection was lacking, especially breakfast items like such basics as scrambled eggs, hash browns, sausage links, etc.  You won't find any of that here.  For the lunch side of the menu, basics that were missing were mashed potatoes, gravies and a variety of carved meats. Perhaps this buffet is trying too hard to cater to many different global societies, which is great, but most of the folks here were looking for the basics.  The best things here were the made to order omelets and the gelato.  My friend actually vomited up his meal soon after we left.  We'll probably stick with the Bellagio buffet or try out the Wicked Spoon buffet at the Cosmo next time we visit.",

Wanted to get my day started off on the right foot with a good buffet. At least I remembered it being good and I was mistaken. I got their a little later the. I liked around 10 am but didn't think I'd be waiting long but I was wrong I waiting 40 plus minuets I was really surprised as to why it was such a long wait. Then when I got to the front I realized if you're a guest at the hotel and you check-in from your room you get to skip the lane and. Damn you really end up paying for it by waiting in line so if you're not staying here either eat somewhere else or be prepared to wait. The buffet seems to be on the smaller side compared to other hotel the servers were really nice and very attentive with bringing me my drinks quickly. I would also say it was very clean and not dirty at all which is nice for a buffet. As for the food it was just lack luster and boring nothing really good about it food was bland and offered nothing. I think the best part about it was that there was an horchata machine but that's it. I just wouldn't come back even if I was given another free comped buffet no thanks give it to someone else.",

    "text": "The Buffet is a veritable smorgasbord orgasbord orgasbord Even when the crowds have 'creased.   Each day when the lights go on it can be found by the pound all around Oh what a lovely feast.  This appetizing yarn of mine is True.  But, it's probably more of a qualified truth since the food you'll find at The Buffet at ARIA is decent but will become increasingly unappetizing as you consume more.  Nonetheless, this is a place where you can glut glut glut glut!  It's been several years since I've been to a buffet of this caliber, so needless to say, I was starved for the variety of options available at a smorgasbord like the one at ARIA.  My initial plan was to stay at the buffet from lunch to dinner so that I wouldn't have to worry about eating multiple meals.  After all, buffets aren't cheap!  (Weekend brunch is $29.99 / Weekend dinner $39.99.)  But, as I sat with a dystopian novel in hand, I found that my eyes wandered from the text to the serving area, which was in my direct line of sight - a foolish maneuver.  The more my eyes wandered, the more I wanted to eat.  And, eat I did!  Thus, my glorious plan to stay at the buffet from 2:30PM to 6:30PM was foiled, and I left after only two hours.  Like most buffets, you pay when you enter the buffet.  You're given the option to tip, and I would recommend doing so since there are friendly and helpful waiters/waitresses who will bring you drinks and clear your plates.  Once you've paid, you will be ushered to a table, asked for your drink order, and then are free to roam around the buffet.  The buffet itself has various stations that serve a range of cuisines (Asian, Indian, Italian, Latin, and Mediterranean) as well as various types of meat (fish, seafood, beef, ham, turkey), salad, and dessert.  Sorry vegans; there didn't appear to be any dessert that was free of animal products (or at the very least dairy-free)!  Part of the reason why I chose to dine at The Buffet at ARIA was because my friend had recommended their buffet as a decent, cheap-ish alternative to some of the fancier (read: more expensive) buffets like Bacchanal. In general, I found that assessment to be accurate, but your dining experience will probably be dictated by how much you eat / how terrible you feel after X number of servings.  Most of my pieces of prime rib were perfectly cooked (medium), but my last piece was tough, dry, and unappetizing (well).  Definitely specify what slice you want; otherwise, the carver will just give you something undesirable.  The ham was good, but not comparable to what you could get at Honeybaked Ham.  I would definitely not recommend eating any of the dim sum if you are at all accustomed to good Chinese food, as I found the charsiu bao and har gow both mushy and strange.  Some of the vegetable options in the Asian station were all right, but were drenched in sauce.  The seafood station had various types of crab legs, shrimp, oysters, smoked salmon, and the like.  Most of these items were tasty, though you could tell they had been previously frozen.  The salad station had ample fruit and vegetables that I would have happily eaten all day.  But, if you're a vegetarian, it's probably not worth coming to this buffet.    Although I generally enjoyed dining at this buffet, I probably should have stopped after my third plate of food, as my final serving made me hate myself and the food I had just eaten. Moral of the story: if you want to enjoy your dining experience, it might not be the best idea to try to get your money's worth.",

We did lunch on Monday, so $23.00 per person and almost no wait. It looks like they renovated, because the place looked fresh. I also liked that there were large windows there and a lot of sunlight coming in. Now, the view that opened was directly showing the pool area, and at certain places, those who dine could see those who soak in the jacuzzi pretty close! Not sure this is the best combination, but whatever.  Our server was on top of things. It looked like she had a lot to do, but we got all the drinks we wanted and she kept an eye on our table at all times. It might not seem like it, but these folks work hard, so we made sure to leave a good tip.   Now, to food. Some of the sections I didn't care for, but out of the eight different cuisines they offer I'm sure you will find something you like. My personal favorites were:  - the European section with the cold cut meats and breads - the seafood section (clam chowder was exceptional!) - the steaks and grilled meats were quite good - the Mediterranean section with pitas and salads - the desserts had a great selection, but you never have room for those, anyways.   I would probably not choose this buffet as a dinner option, but for lunch it was great!",

Yes there were a couple things that were stale, but we came at the end of the lunch rush.  Overall a great place. Of course the BOGO helps off MyVegas.   Give them a try, I think you will like it.",

    "text": "Just got back from Vegas and ate here twice, as it was convenient for us staying at the Aria. Not sure why so many people have given the buffet not great reviews. I will preface this by saying I am NOT a fan of buffets usually, but when in Rome...  This buffet has a very good selection of food. Everything from an Italian station, to Asian, to tandoori (with great freshly made naan), to a carving station and seafood. There's also soups, salad and Mexican. I think that's most of it? But probably more I'm blanking on right now. Clearly there's everything here depending on your mood. Everything I ate was solid. My favorites were the turkey breast at the carving station with cranberry sauce (went back for seconds and thirds lol) the mashed potatoes, veggie lasagna and shredded beef. Plus there's the dessert station with gelato and a nice selection of sweets :)  For being so busy everything was clean and organized. They were constantly replenishing food so I never saw them run out of an item. Service was good as well. Plates were cleared quickly and drinks were refilled without even asking. I plan of coming back here next time I'm in Vegas",

    "text": "When first walking into the Buffet at Aria I was very pleased. The atmosphere is pleasant. The decor is not over the top. It is just a nice place to dine. I was surprised to find that on Friday to Sunday evenings your buffet also includes a whole Maine Lobster for two and all you can drink house wine.  When we first sat down it took over ten minutes before anyone came by to take our drink order. Our server seemed to not be in a good mood and we thought we might have problems, but that didn't seem to last very long and she provided very good service after our first encounter. For my wine selection I chose the Buffet's house red, which is a Merlot. I am sometimes hesitant about ordering house wines. They can tend to be watery, acidic, and have not much flavor. I was very pleased with the Buffet's house Merlot. It had a pleasant aroma, nice legs, and the flavor was acidic to the point of just giving it a little kick. The after taste was quite pleasing as well. The wine was a pleasant addition to my dining experience.  The floor of the Buffet is spread out with many live-action stations and a large selection to choose from. The selection includes what you might find in many buffets in Las Vegas, Sushi, Mexican, Italian, Prime Meats, Soups, and Deserts. But, all the selections have more of a gourmet feel to them. The salad bar is not very large, but it provides all you need to make a very nice salad. There is no iceberg lettuce to be found, only romaine and spring greens. There are many toppings for your salad as well as about a dozen dressings to choose from. They have a made to order pasta station with many pastas and toppings. The carving station has several meats including lamb, turkey and prime rib. I had a slice of the prime rib. I was surprised that I was given a thin English Cut and not a thicker slice, but the flavor was very good. Not as high quality as I would expect from a high end steak house, but the meat was tender and tasty.  One thing you don't find at all the buffets in Las Vegas is a deli station. This station has several meats, cheeses, breads, and condiments to make a quite tasty sandwich. Another item on the deli station I was pleased to find was an olive tray. There were several types of olives to delight in. Each having it's own unique flavor and texture. the Buffet at Aria is the only buffet in Las Vegas to showcase a Tandoor oven. Out of this oven comes kabobs, freshly baked naan, and one of my favorite items at the Buffet, a chicken & cheese quesadilla. Out of a Tandoor oven you may ask, yes, it was wonderful.  The last items for most people are the items in the dessert station. This station is not very large, but it does not need to be. There is a lot in this station including cookies, pastries, and freshly made ice cream. Many items are also prepared without sugar. This station is the work of World Pastry Champion Chef Jean-Philippe Maury. I had a chocolate chip cookie which was very rich. I could not finish it. I also had a scoop of their freshly made Butterfingers Ice Cream. It was very creamy and had a wonderful taste.  All-in-all this was a pleasant dining experience, but I would not put it at the top of the Buffets in Las Vegas, even though I did enjoy it.",

My initial experience would be rated a zero-star, but unfortunately Yelp won't let me be that unforgiving.  So, I would have rated it one star.  The food and service was as ugly as it gets.  Food tasted a day old.  The server couldn't do a simple task of refilling beverages.  Luckily, the manager was kind enough to refund my thirty-eight dollars.  I told myself that I would come back after a good amount of time, so they could take their one star ratings, and turn them into fives.  And now, I am back a year later.  The service is the same. Surprisingly, the food improved just enough to give them an extra star difference!  Come on, Aria.  Do you really want to market yourself as the center of Las Vegas, when you can't do a buffet correctly?  Yeah you have crab legs, but even the Mcdonalds of buffets have them these days.    You may have already lost this one to Cosmopolitan.  Cheaper, and better.   I recommend trying out Wicked Spoon.  It's worth the extra walk if you're staying at Aria.",

I did not like how you start the line at the crab legs, where everyone and their brother is waiting to squeeze as much crab on a plate as possible.  I thought the sushi was good for a buffet, and the deserts were also delicious and came with many choices.  The buffet is worth the money if you come just before lunch and get the breakfast price (about $15) but get to eat both breakfast and lunch foods (this is what we did the second day and that meal was a four star meal).   I don't eat crab legs, but if you do you would probably rate this as four stars because everyone who was eating them seemed very happy and those things certainly are not cheap at a non-buffet place .",

My sister and I waited in line for 40 minutes to eat here even though they upcharged the dinner price for Labor Day weekend.  Cashier lady that checked us in did not look happy to be there and when I asked what my total was after she mumbled it she gave me a stern look and pointed to her screen like I was deaf or something.  Wtf?  Okay moving on to our table.  Waited for 10 minutes for server to come by and take our drink orders and no show so we decided to make our 1st rounds.  Food looks great in appearance.  Key word:  APPEARANCE.  Omg I kid you not 9/10 things that I grabbed were so salty it almost made me want to gag and throw up because it was uneatable.  Their Thai beef, tom yum soup, pho, gumbo, clams, barbacoa and almost everything else was basically seeping in salt.  It was disgusting.  So many of the food was not available and even after being there for half an hour and making several rounds they still were not available.  Let's talk about plates- or lack thereof.  Each station were missing plates and bowls!!  The girl bringing out new plates saw me wandering around and gave me 2 plates and said \"you'll need an extra one just in case\".  Like shit, are they just completely short or plates or does dishwashing take hours to finish a batch??  I found myself and a few girls waiting around the soup station for some small bowls to get soup.  WTH is going on??  Our server was terrible.  Made little to no visits so old plates were piling up and when we needed refills for our coke he heard us call for him, turned around to start directly at us and walk away without saying one thing.  I had to flag him down 10 minutes later to get some drink refills.  I was hoping dessert would be the saving grace yet the only thing I was looking forward to were the creme brulee and it was also \"no longer available\".  This was the worst $48 I spent on a buffet.  There is a place by my house in California that had infinitely better tasting food and service for less than half the price!  This was the most regrettable decision I've made on this trip.  Should have gone to the Bacchanal which was exceptional!",

Food selections not too overwhelming. Meat section has decent options for ham, prime rib and sausages.   Seafood- they have crab legs. Only thing we wanted.   They had an Asian section too. Not impressed with this section.  Desserts- cakes, cookies and ice cream are ok.   Service-fast and attentive   Overall, it's an ok buffet if you want to try one in Vegas. My expectations were quite high for food quality. It's just not there.",

It took our server a while to bring our drinks, and when i gave out the drink he didn't look pleased (i didn't want to be complicated so my father and i ordered the same drinks). My father and i finished our first round of plates and drinks so we went to grab more food and when we came back, everything was still there.  The server noticed and rushed to clear it off. There wasn't many people on our side of the buffet so we didn't know why so we decided to let it slide. After that our drinks were done and it was about 10 minutes until our drinks were once again refilled and the server even left plates we finished there for a long time. My father does enjoy leaving tips for our servers based on performance and this was a non-tip performance. I paid for everything so I was going to leave a tip but with the service, I did not enjoy it. The server seems unpleased with us the moment we came and was being polite to everyone beside us. Once we started to leave we didn't have many plates there and the food was cleaned off. My father said thank you and while i was grabbing my coat heading to go, the server shouted out thank you twice at me very furious  I understand if he was upset bc we did not tip him, but based on his service, my father and i were not satisfied. Especially when he snapped at me, and I'm a teenager. This was something I did not expect to happen at a place my father loved going to.",

    "text": "Yelp 100:7/100  The Aria buffet isn't bad. It's definitely good in some spots but not good in others. I don't go out of my way for buffets but Cosmo, Aria, and Wynn get a pass in my book.   I had a myvegas reward and ended up getting two lunches for 29$. They have a lot of other drinks besides soda so I ordered pineapple juice. They have an all you can drink menu to add for 16$ but who can really drink all of that? Especially when copious amounts of food are involved.   The steamed crab, mussel bake, and Asian food are some of the best. In my opinion the dessert fall flat except the gelato and some sugar free items. The elote needed more seasoning but the pork and leek cake had amazing flavor. They also have congee/ porridge and a variety of soups. They have mini pho and ramen in addition to a carving station. The beef Colorado has good flavor  and was tender. Pizza was just okay and the charcuterie was not quite as good as last time. I would maybe try dinner to see if it's any better but I'd stick to Asian dishes and seafood. The split crab is good but the steamed is even better and more flavorful. Interestingly enough this has become a stop, but I'd definitely try wicked spoon first.   No service complaints and plates didn't pile up.  A diverse selection of food including Mediterranean and Indian.",

They have both snow crabs and king crab legs. they use to put them both out at the same time but now they alternate them every 30 min. I just recently found out that you can ask the seafood station to cook the seafood a certain way if you like. For example, like you can get oyster and baked them with cheese or grill shrimp with cheese as well. They also have lots of different type of cuisine from all over the world. They also have great dessert! Overall, I think it rivals Bellagio's buffet and better than the other buffet on the strip!",

Went three times and, every time (even during different times of the day), there was at least a twenty minute wait (that was in the short \"gold\" member line).  Service and overall moral of the staff consistently was disappointing even though we made every effort to be friendly and make their lives easier.   Ultimately, it was more of a convenience than anything that led us to return. I realize that it would've been more time and cost efficient to go somewhere else and that's what will happen in the future.   TLDR; had to wait a long time to be seated, mediocre food, and sub par service.",

The foods were not great, it's just so so. The staff were stiff. I heard one staff were talking bad about a customer in her walkie talkie while walking. In addition to that, I think the buffet place itself was very unorganized. A lot of the food tags did not match with the food itself i.e. the food tag was duck confit, but it's actually fruity yogurts. They had sushi, but I think it was leftover from yesterday's dinner since the rice was not fresh, just like if you have kept it in the fridge overnight. The quality is way below other buffet places. Bellagio buffet is so much nicer in quality.  They have ice cream for breakfast though.",

I had an omelette, crab legs, fresh fruits, and carrot cake pancakes. I enjoyed the pancakes, they were really fluffy-maybe a little too sweet. But if you have a sweet tooth like me, then try it! I am a huge seafood fan and I was excited that I can finally try stone crab claws, but these claws were frozen. They were basically crab pops. Not a fan. I loved the fresh fruits and the desserts. The vanilla gelato is to die for.  The price for breakfast is $31 per person-i think. I guess it is a reasonable price for Vegas and being on the Strip. I definitely tried to eat as much to get my moneys worth. Overall, the restaurant is clean and it is very family friendly. Next time I am in Vegas I will return.",

I'm pretty sure I'm missing some cuisines but bear with me lol.  I was impressed with their seafood station. They have a huge selection of crab legs, several different types of shellfish, shrimp, fish, crawfish. I know I got my money's worth on just the seafood alone. The seafood is what makes this place shine!  They had a carving station but I was not a fan of their meat. Their steak was dry but flavorful. Other meat they had including the sausage, short rib, and ham were decent though.  The dessert station will satisfy any sweet tooth. It was one of the most expansive dessert selections I've seen at a buffet. I wanted to get one of each but won't fit on one plate! The dessert selection is on par with Bacchanal Buffet I'd say.

I am quite picky but adore great customer service and a terrific meal and giving the compliments were deserved. Which brings us to this evenings dinner @ The Buffet located inside Aria Resort. I will explain that my first two plates were full of crab legs ( meat plump and moist... And warm ).. Melted butter straight from some amazing hot butter stirring machine.. fresh wedges of lemon line my plate as I salivate.  My only complaint is that I don't have the skills to carry as many plates as I truly needed. Crab legs in hand, I manage to grab a stainless steel bowl of delicious shrimp and grits, a fish taco and proceed to walk. I couldn't eat fast enough and truly got primal on these crusteans. Absolutely no shame in my game as I refuse to give in to a silly crab shell .. they have crackers but not the handy slicer to ease the pain of getting to the gold which is that meat! Before I tapped out I managed to rally a delightful slice of prime rib with my choice or both ( thank you baby Jesus ) creamy and straight horseradish. Awesomeness in my mouth... Nose hair burning good. The only thing I didn't like was my bloody mary but who cares.... No matter. My favorite part of this experience? As I shovel my face full of this amazingness, butter shamelessly dripping from my hands, there is NOT one bit of seafood odor...  Sold best buffet so far. I highly recommend the seafood and steak, but if they can master those, pretty sure the salad/dessert/Mediterranean/and all other options should be superb. I ate too fast to take photos... That good.",

It was delicious!  Best item in the buffet!  Unfortunately, some issues with labeling food items.  Three attempts for the BBQ Pork steam buns but keep getting a custard filling ones.  We notice several of the food items were a little heavy on the salt.  Also, very slow on refilling on several entrees.  Dessert was okay.

Now the meats are just ok, what they call Texas Brisket is a joke.. I live in Texas and I have way better brisket. The wedge salad was crisp, but not ice cold. And on to the crab legs... They have cooked ones, but i'm not a fan, they were small and hardly any edible meat in them, the cold crab legs were Dungeness, which i'm really not a fan of, they were small and the meat was rubbery, the old crab legs we had a few months ago, were snow crab, very tasty.. I guess they are getting cheap! I wondered why at 5pm when we got here there was no line at all, and now at 6:45, there is still no line on a Tuesday night. The service is still good and the desserts are good, but i was really craving crab legs on my trip to Vegas, i'll have to find another buffet now.. Thanks, Aria",

My only complaint, and its really not a complaint, is that the selection of items is smaller than most other buffets, but know everything they serve is outstanding.  Will be back. GF loved it.",

Waffles made, pancakes of all different flavors made for you...red velvet and carrot cake pancakes to name a few. The sweets were top notch (best cinnamon rolls I've EVER had) and of course your regular breakfast foods and lunch specialties (smoked salmon, salads, etc.). One of the \"fancier\" buffets on the strip I'd say. Will definitely try to return!",

When I asked the server what kind of flavor ice cream behind the front area (the some of the labels were missing and plus the clear lid was cloudy), the server was like standing there for a second and gave me an expression like \"why are u asking me this? \"  And not to mention the wait time was a bit long! There were quite a few tables but staffing was seem shorted. Bottom line the whole dining experience was not satisfied!",

Only after my cousin's co-workers decided to go here during a conference when I finally decided to come.  It's actually a relatively good deal for about $40, you have various food stations with many ethnic choices.  It's too much to detail in this review and I'll go over what you should focus on (at least these are the items I liked).  The oysters in the grill station is a must. Don't like that they add breadcrumbs and a creamy sauce.  Of course, you can scrape it off.  The snow crab legs is a very popular item and for good reason.  When you see some available, by all means get it while you can.  The poke station is another good addition.  They have ample choices to make a poke bowl the way you like it.  You can even opt not to add the rice which will take up valuable space in your stomach.  Save some room for the gelato station, you will find a dozen flavors, and you should find one you like.",

Delicious menu items from Asian to Thai to gourmet pizza. Mediterranean and gourmet deserts. I highly recommend it . For a regular price of $29.99 for lunch during the week, not bad!",

So we got the brunch menu.. they had the usual meats, pizza, bread bar, omelet station, asian food, and dessert area. Their food was just alright. Nothing really stood out.  But this buffet is cheaper than most out there... for brunch it was $28.99. You can also add bottomless mimosas for like $20. The waiters were really nice though and always attentive and cleared tables quickly and always got you what you needed.  Probably would not come back here, considering theres so many other better buffets on the strip!",

I tried giving him $40, but he would only take $10 and processed us through with no wait. At $40 per person, I expected great quality food but was very disappointed. It was definitely catered toward Asian cuisine, which I don't typically mind, but everything was way too spicy. Tony, being a meat and potato guy, couldn't find plain mashed potatoes. Everything had cheese or thick cream and egg added.  The only reason I'm giving 3 stars is our server Alfredo who is amazing, hostess Hope who is also amazing and the desserts! You must have the ice cream!! We probably won't go back unless we're comped.",

We went four times throughout the day, and were able to avoid longer lines, which was a plus at lunch and late dinner (9pm). Omelette Bar accommodated and made boiled eggs upon request. The steamed Oyster Rockefeller could have be cleaned a little better but they were decent.  Plenty of crab legs available at dinner and great dessert choices throughout the day. The waiters and manager Dara were quick and attentive throughout the day. Definitely recommend, this buffet over some of the others on the strip.",

They also have two complimentary drinks that will absolutely knock your sox off: THAI TEA and HORCHATA if you don't know what those are, you better do some googling.   In the past year I've visited these buffets and here's my analysis:  Caesars Bacchanal: most selection, most expensive, and they change up seasonal items.  Wynn The Buffet: most decorative, best presentation, good place to impress guests.   Cosmo Wicked: best dessert items, good food quality, and the top item for me is bone marrows.   Bellagio and Paris both were underwhelming. Especially Bellagio was over priced, dark, and food was on par with country buffet.    Aria had the best balance between ambience and quality. Another perk of being MGM Pearl member and above is to skip long buffet lines. Mlife forever!",

For $20, you have quite a few options of bottomless alcoholic beverages. Definitely worth it if you want a few drinks!   The dessert section is a bit lackluster for my sweet tooth but overall not a bad buffet experience in Vegas. Around $50 gourmet weekend dinner. Sounds about right for the Vegas price tag.  Lots of crab legs and nice big shrimps. Poke bowl station also did not disappoint. Lots of interesting cuisines to try. Stay away from the oysters unless it was just a bad night for them when we went. It was not cleaned well and did not look tasty (They were ordered).   Great service and staff!",

The food had a few tasty spots, but mostly was just uninteresting. The majority of the staff seemed to aggressively hate their lives or were bothered to do anything (which is strange since the concept here is that most stations required staff assistance). The guy dealing with noodle soup bowls was throwing around bowls all loudly and throwing cilantro sloppily over the countertop missing most of the bowls. It seemed like an intentional production to show how beneath him he thought this was. Hard to explain, but it was kooky. Even those that weren't rude seemed baffled or new, for example the woman making poke bowls clearly had never done it before. I saw server once, to bring drinks, never again. Aria is a fancy place so the lack of professionalism and quality was strange.  The positive though was the dessert station had a lot of good options and the African American guy working there was noticeably friendly and seemed to really like to interact with customers. A noticeable difference from the rest of the staff. I see many reviews I think are lauding this guy as being cool while the rest are sucky (many day he used to work at carving station if this is same guy). So if management is reading this, please give him a raise and try to actually train the rest of people who really don't seem to care to be there.",

Not sure if I am being fair with this as I generally do not enjoy buffets...any place that I have have to wait in line or watch people mull around with plates of food in their hands while they \"sample and eat\" at various food stations does not appeal to me.  Needless to say The Buffet at Aria has vastly improved from its original days.  Clean, open dining area seen from the hallway makes it feel spacious.  The individual food stations were small while the portions were also small...nice!  Better than a huge stainless steel tray and a spoon where you scoop up your portion size. I think this is better so that you will eat smaller portions and more variety.  It was nice to see a seafood station that is part of their regular menu...nit some special Only on Friday or the weekend.  If you like buffets and are with friends or family, I would suggest giving this one a shot however if you're looking to be impressed there are others that are far better than Aria....",

Cons:  - Majority of the hot dishes were cold, not warm but actually cold even though some of them were brought out fresh - Nothing really stands out to make it unique - Price for what was offered  Pros:  - Sushi was pretty good compared to buffet sushi - The nan breads were great - King Crab legs  I most likely would never come back unless they get their act together. It was a pretty horrible experience for Day 1.",

Holiday pricing was in effect so that was a little surprise. We went at brunch and had a little wait to be seated. The 2 hour stay restriction is enough to sit and digest after eating. Some dishes were cold by the time I stated stuffing my face. Corned beef hash was not good. Tons of variety! I was excited to see curry and naan and it was very good. I was not impressed with the Asian food. Gelato was very good! I was full by the end but nothing too special. I will try another famous buffet when I' in Vegas next.",

    "text": "If you head to the Buffet at ARIA, bring your stomach for sure.   The line is always pretty long unless you have a pass from the hotel (basically I wouldn't consider it worth standing in the regular line, with how long it generally looks...), and it's really not very cheap. The service is pretty nice, though. The waiters and waitresses are pretty attentive with refilling drinks, which is nice. Drinks like soda are included in the price, and the price of alcohol isn't too bad.   Walking into the buffet, the first thing that's noticeable is the decor - it's a stunning room, with a gorgeous view of the pool. Plenty of natural light comes in during the day, and you can still see outside at night. It's a really lovely view, especially if you're seated by the window.   The food isn't bad, but it's \"quantity over quality\" for sure. Most things are good, with a few exceptions that are great. Very few of the options I've tried have every really been bad, necessarily, just not amazing. Unfortunately very little of the lunch/dinner foods are really exceptional. One of the great features is the variety. The buffet sets up different stations, including Asian, Mediterranean, Indian, Italian, seafood, and traditional American fare. There are areas with cheeses and olives and meats, and you can find sushi and crab legs and all sorts of other things. Basically if you try one food and don't like it, there's bound to be something else you'll enjoy. It's a great chance to try some new things, and it makes for a fun meal if you've got adventurous tastes.   On one of our trips we were there for Christmas, and the buffet had a special where they offered a lobster with the meal for a small added fee. That was definitely a mistake - it was very dry and chewy, and not even worth the small amount extra.   Where the buffet shines is in the fact that the desserts are absolutely fantastic. My one regret every time I've gone is that it would be ridiculous to try everything, so my friend and I got in the habit of getting different ones and sharing so that we could try as much as possible. They're beautifully presented, with decorated plates, cute dishes, and stunning designs, and they always taste absolutely wonderful. They also have gelato options. The sweets are definitely on par with the other bakeries and dessert shops in the building.",

    "text": "Free buffet for breakfast came with my room booking.  Sure beats the hell out of a Marriott continental breakfast in Anytown, USA.  I am usually pretty skeptical about buffets, but wow do I love the higher end variants that appear to be rather sanitary.  Since I am a hefty fellow, I do not take the task of adequately preparing for a buffet lightly.  You have to know what I am talking about when you fill up after eating only two, two and a half heaping plates.  It's very dissapoining.  Think about how much you are leaving on the table (look at me, droppin a pun).  Meanwhile, think about a lighter dinner the night before, and even if you drink, resist the urge of a big 3AM meal.  I did just this, and woke up around 8AM and mentally prepared myself for a 10AM feast.  Meditation, some slots, USA today, perhaps some of you more fit folks might get an early morning workout in (me, not so much, that's just silly talk).    If you are famished by the time you check in with the cashier for the buffet line, congrats, you have properly prepared for your breakfast.  The service was very good - friendly and attentive.  The food selection is quite overwhelming, with different ethnic stations surely adding to the experience.  While I won't put the experience quite on par with the Wynn buffet, it will absolutly get the job done.  I dont need to list every station, but I think my plates consisted of various concoctions of eggs, belgian waffles, pizza, yogurt parfaits, donuts, Indian naan, latin style eggs and tortillas, gellato, asian dumplings, and all kinds of other fun stuff.  Lots of different seafood offerings as well.  So overall, it's a great comped breakfast, but at thirty something dollars a person, I'd probably consider taking a walk to Denny's if I had to pay for it.  That said, if I was feeling lazy, I'm sure the thirty something dollars is relatively cheap compared to regularly priced restaruants at the hotels.  So go on, grab that special someone, and treat them to the romantic meal of a lifetime.  **bonus** I didn't see people taking pictures of their plates and the food stations in order to post them on various social media sites.  Which made me happy. Because, please reach out to me and let me know why in the name of {Insert chosen diety here} to people feel the need to do that?  **Bonus 2** Just to show you how serious I am about my buffet eating:  Upon returning to my table I found my table cleared..I asked the waitress and she apologized and said, that I had finished a few plates and a couple of dessert plates so she thought i was done.  i said it was understandable and put my next round of two plates on the table to continue my meal.  I had such a smile inside, because even for a buffet waitress, who probably has witnessed gluttony like you can't possibly imagine, I somehow baffled her.  I guess it's a good time to tell you that Adam from Man vs. Food is my personal role model...",

However, because this is Las Vegas I felt it should be a little better. Perhaps offering options that aren't available at every other buffet on the strip. It cost $80 for two of us to dine at night. We arrived at 8:45 and I know they closed at 10, but one of the employees said food would be out until 10:30. What she meant was the food already cooked would be out, but as the night went on dished offered on my first time around were gone. By the time I hit the dessert station at 9:40 there were only 4 varieties of Gelato left and very few options for the 1-2 bite desserts. People were walking in at 9:30 and I felt bad for them. I don't think there will be a next time for us here at the Aria Buffet, but if there was I would definitely come earlier. Our number 1 buffet of choice on the strip is the Wynn and 2 Belagio, for your taste reference.",

Yeah they had seafood, Mexican, Asian, etc. but selection was still very very limited compared to other hotel buffets in the surrounding area. Save yourself some time and money and goto Bacchanal buffet in Caesars Palace or Mandalay Bay.",

The weekend dinner is a bit expensive - $38 / person which includes drinks, a small lobster, and endless king crab and snow crab legs.  If you arent crazy about drinks and lobsters, try weekday lunch which is about $25 and probably one of the best value buffet considering quality of the food.",

So for that amount of money I expected champagne to be flowing like crazy but NO, they said they ran out of champagne...WHAT?? We asked for a refill and they said yes at first and avoided our table. Ok we were kind of loud and obnoxious but who isn't in Vegas? Then a lady came and told us they ran out after about 20 min. All we wanted was one more refill...so lame.   The food was delicious though despite the crappy service. They had a huge variety of meats like prime rib, pork, ham, sirloin steak. They also had sushi, chinese, and a great breakfast. The mash potatoes with country gravy was to die for. The dessert was bomb, they had regular/sugar free gelato and a million different cakes. The food overall was really yummy, not so sure about the service.",

Something has changed with the quality of the food - it is now the quality of a cheap Chinese Buffett. The quality and the variety of the food has changed so drastically, there must have been some huge management change.  When the claw of a crab leg is no bigger than a teenager's thumb, time to find a new buffet.  Goodbye Aria buffet, let us know when you get rid of the management that has ruined the quality and the reputation of this once great buffet.  Adding king crab does not make up from or the gourmet delights that were available in the past.  Not worth the money.",

Our servers name was Sonny and he really lived up to his name. He had a smile he was attentive and upbeat the entire time. It can really make or break your dinner experience even if it is buffet . He made our experience there that much more enjoyable and wonderful. The food was Amazing. Hot crab legs on the dinner buffet and already cracked for you so all you had to do was scoop out the meat. A variety of shrimp and so much more to choose from. Their labeling system was a little different for foods. Instead of being on the glass over the food it was on chalkboards on that strip of the bar above all the foods. Very inventive and cute. Dessert bar was amazing. Everything about this buffet was well worth it. I will def be back for this one. A huge shout out to Sonny.....Thank you for making our experience the best yet at a Vegas Buffet",

I was lured in by the promise of crab legs and beautiful desserts but what I got was luke-warm crab legs that were small and picked over during my entire two-hours there and the desserts looked gorgeous but were not that good.  I found a few items I really enjoyed such as the charcuterie but I can get those at most fine dining establishments around the strip.  Bottom line is you get a variety of items to choose from but for the price you are paying you could get one great meal anywhere on the strip that isn't dried out, sitting under lights for hours, and seriously sub-par.  I'd rather pay $50 for one meal that is like ambrosia every bite.  Excellent service btw.",

When we sat down, the waiter took our drink orders right away, but he vanished until after we'd already finished our first full plate of food. We later asked for refills, but he totally forgot. Dirty plates also took a very long time to clear.  We were excited, at first, when we heard there was unlimited crab legs. However, the quality of the crab legs was only so-so - you can tell that they just pulled them out of the freezer. They did have a nice mix of breakfast and lunch items, and I tried a little of almost everything. However, nothing really stood out in my mind as being really good (I didn't go back for seconds on anything). The best part, in my mind, was the cheesecake for dessert.  I'll spend my $30 elswhere for lunch next time.",

I don't eat a lot of seafood so I can't comment on the crab legs which seems to be a major selling point for them. The carving station is not my cup of tea coz its \"juiced up\" animals, spiceless junk and lacking any flavor, in my opinion. I cannot see how people eat this without hot sauce or spicy salsa. The Italian, Chinese, Mexican and Indian sections, plain and simply suck with limp veggies and poorly flavored meat.   The only positive about the buffet is the dessert section, which had a great selection of desserts. I usually dont eat dessert but I had the vanilla gelato and strawberry cheesecake which were very good.",

This is my 3rd time in Vegas so I've tried loooots of casino buffets...and I was really disappointed with this one.   First off, it looked like a food court.   Now let's talk about the food. They had various types of food - Asian, Italian, Mediterranean, American, and Indian. But the selection was very limited. The Italian section consisted of some cheeses, deli meats, a conspicuous make-your-own-pasta station and a few vegetarian options. The pasta station would have been great...if anyone could see that the sign says you can make your own pasta. If they couldn't see the sign, it just looks like a glass wall you walk right past. The seafood section was meh - the cocktail shrimp was good, the mussels were not good, and the crab legs were tiny little things. Not worth the effort. The only good thing was the prime rib. Tender and juicy, add some gravy, creamed corn and mashed buttermilk potatoes and you've got the 2 stars for this review! The fruit was good - small bite sized pieces which I appreciated. And the dessert bar... Oh how could you mess THAT up, Aria?? I had the cheesecake, coconut macaroon and the flan. The flan was good, the macaroon was too coconutty (do with that as you will) and the cheesecake was overwhelmed by the blueberry sauce ontop.   Basically, go spend your money at Bellagio or Caesars.",

I went for Sunday brunch and it was fantastic. t's only $29 for the brunch and an additional $12 for unlimited cocktails, beer, wine and champagne. Anything you could possibly want to eat was there for you. I really enjoyed the crab legs, dumplings and extensive carving station. If you plan to buffet it in Vegas, this is a good one to try. The line was short too!",

The 'complimentary' lobster was freezer burned and tough. The prime rib was overcooked and rubbery (what did they do? Cook it, freeze it, then zap it in the microwave?)  Beautiful surroundings, terrible service (could have used another glass of wine after that meal.) Not worth the price, even if it's free.  Check out the Cosmo buffet, Spice Market at Planet Hollywood, or the Bellagio for a better gourmet buffet experience.",

    "text": "A large group of us had brunch here on a sunday afternoon.  The price ($23) wasn't bad for a hotel buffet on the strip, and was a much cheaper option than any of the other restaurants inside Aria.  We had 10 in our group and didn't have to wait very long for a seat, which was a blessing after a long night of clubbing/drinking, etc.   The king crab legs were plentiful and meaty and the salad bar had fresh blueberries and blackberries along with all the other veggie goodies.  The belgian waffles were soft and fluffy and the breakfast burrito was surprisingly tasty (i think it was chorizo and egg).  The prime rib was delicious and the garlic naan was good too.  An entire side of asian dishes wasn't what I expected for brunch, but they had a lot of options.  I only tried the chinese broccoli, peking duck and the dim-sum.  I made the mistake of putting plum sauce on my peking duck, and it was horribly salty.  The duck in the steamed bun would have been okay by themselves.  The dim sum wasn't bad.  Good chicken noodle soup too.     Their desserts were so pretty it's almost hard to eat them...almost.  The strawberry shortcake was delicious, as was the caramel flan.  The strawberry bread pudding was decent, and when mixed with the bananas foster, it was really good.  I remember trying about 2 other types of cakes they had out on display...one chocolate opera and what I thought was blueberry cheesecake (instead, I got tricked into getting a lemon-y cake of some sort with blueberry sauce!)  One of my friends asked for tea, and the server brought him a wonderful lavender Earl Grey tea....yet, when another friend in our group asked for tea, he was brought an herbal tea that tasted like bad potpourri and perfume. :(  If you ask for tea, make sure to ask what your options are.   Overall, I thought this buffet was pretty good for the price.",

We got there with the end of lunch food still out. The brisket with BBQ sauce was very good. If you get there at 3:30 ish... Not much to choose from for food. Crab legs were not so big. Sushi was all dried out. When 4pm comes around the new food comes out. The shrimp cocktail is now in 2 piece shooters. Still good. The salad shooters are good to try. The prime rib was good. Everything else was okay. The desserts were awesome. Recommend the butterfinger ice cream. The strawberry shortcake was tart but tasty. The tiramisu was great. Snicker cake was yummy. Overall not bad but like all buffets, a little pricey.",

    "text": "Okay, after reading a lot of recent reviews with people raving about the buffet at The Aria (not all on yelp), I convinced my bf to come here instead of Bellagio buffet.  Boy, I kind of regret it. I came here after walking eons on the strip just for the buffet and the line should've been the first indication that this place wasn't that great. For a Sunday afternoon, the line for brunch was short. So short that it made me feel silly for rushing to get to the buffet in case there was a long wait (like Bellagio, for instance.) I guess we should be thankful that the line was so short so we could promptly be seated, but the problem was, we want to get seated quickly for buffets that exceeded expectations. For a mediocre brunch buffet here, it didn't surprise us that the line was short.   First, let me discuss the selection of food. Yes, there is a variety of cuisine available, from Asian to Italian to Mexican to anything. Breakfast food was also an option, like danishes, muffins, french toast, etc. But the problem was, the selection was small and the quality average! You can basically see everything they had to offer with one glance. The meat, steaks, etc were tough and dry and some foods were plain bad (chow foon - too salty). We were not impressed with the quality of options there. Everything just tasted okay-to-acceptable, with only a few that were exceptionally great (if you were to go, I suggest eating the cracked crab legs with the clarified butter, the seamen's stew, the sugar-free coconut cake & coconut gelato.) It's not what I would pay good money for - though to be fair, this is probably one of the cheapest brunch buffets around. You get what you pay for, I guess, but I didn't come here because of the cheaper price (~30 pp.) I wanted to be wowed, dazzled and impressed by an authentic Las Vegas Sin City type of buffet experience that would forever change and rival my meaning of good food. I read great recommendations for this place and thought this would be it and even condescendingly judged those who gave this place bad reviews as chumps. Well, guess I'm the chump now.  On the other hand, the service was spectacular. Our section's waitress did a fantastic job taking away plates when needed and being so considerate and attentive to our needs. She had some really cute hair clips in the front, which made her easily identifiable, not that we needed it since she was so attentive so we made sure to give extra tips. She made the experience a lot easier to swallow, but average food is average. Can't lie about that.  If we ever go back to Vegas, we will not be coming here again.",

When I came here the first time, they had this delicious honey baked ham and a coconut macaroon for dessert! It was one of the best macaroons I've ever had. Now, the only thing I like is their prime rib and that's not even that great. For $40 per person, I expected more. I mean, I'm not asking for fireworks, but at least put some more effort into it like you did before. VERY disappointed.",

Now Aria isn't a bad buffet place great service nice selection of foods. But I wouldn't really consider anything very gourmet here. All the food are staple foods the cocktail shrimp are not the highest grade compared to the above 3 but it's better than your hosh posh mix of janky buffets. The nice thing about the Aria that I did enjoy was that after the nice meal the walk around the mall next door was perfect to walk it off sorta speak.  The desserts in here as well were a-ok but nothing spectacular compared to the above 3. I got comped 2 buffets for staying at the signature so it wasn't really terrible considering I didn't pay. It's the same price nearly as the other buffets as well so consider this before actually making it out here.  If I'm near here I guess I'd hit this up since it's not terrible and meets the standard of buffets in Vegas!",

    "text": "Man, i'm not too sure of why there are so many reviews saying the food is poor to mediocre at best...but i guess to each his own.    We got there 10 mins before dinner time so we paid the lunch price...we also had no wait in line and the amount of people in the buffet was comfortable.  No running into people with ur plate or waiting to serve yourself!  I'm a BIG buffet person and normally I only like 30-50% of foods at a buffet, but this buffet was just delicious to me!  There's just something about having different types of edibles all around you as far as eyes can see that puts a smile on a face.  Its a very clean restaurant.  Decor was really modern and light colored which made for a better appetite in my opinion.  Their food presentation was on point, made it real inviting and appetizing, there was no mess anywhere.  Items were constantly being refilled with fresh replacements.    Prime Rib - the piece i got was very rare and fatty.  A+  however it wasn't as juicy                        as i was hoping, easily fixed with some au jus and salt/pepper. Crab Legs - legs/claws were served cold and sliced open for convenience..they                       gladly steamed mine and it was delicious, moist and sweet + some                       drawn butter, i was 100% satisfied! Beef Stroganoff - Kind of a rare dish for me to see at a Vegas buffet but i was                                        happy nonetheless.  It had great flavor and was loaded with                                 mushrooms.  Parmesan Asparagus - served cold and was cooked perfectly, had a slight                                             crunch and was delightful.  I also really don't see too                                            much asparagus at buffets so it was a very nice surprise. Creamed spinach - was AWESOME!   Loaded MashedTatos - AWESOME as well.  It had lots of green onions and                                             cheese.  There were a bunch of other little items that were really great.  The only items i felt needed a little work on was getting more of an asian selection.  I mean it wasn't the best, but was better than other chinese food at other hotel buffets.  They're mussels pasta could've been really good, but was just WAY too salty i had to take a swig after each bite, i gave up after the 3rd.  Wasn't impressed with their sushi just cuz it looked like there was more rice ratio than anything.  And lastly their salads looked real appetizing but lacked good flavor on the 2 that i tried, the Caesar and Chinese Chicken salad.    The one thing i was very disappointed in was me and the hubby not receiving any complimentary champagne/wine/lobster as other reviewers were saying they received...  Maybe because we got there right before dinner time but still disappointing..  Lastly, their desserts.  Im not a dessert person but i tried some bread pudding and my eyes rolled back!  Had 2 plates of that.  Also had Tiramisu and their Snickers cake which was awesome!    See you soon Aria!",

I was so excited to go, it was really beautiful and the lady who rung us out was the sweetest can't recall her name though... I get in food looks great although not as much seafood as I remembered... I make a plate my waiter was this warm hearted beautiful Ethiopian woman I can remember her name but she was very kind. In the middle of my dinner I end up getting a call its a family emergency I haven't even taken a bite yet. It's not cheap either... So me and my BF get up to leave I ask to speak to a manager they tell me he's on his way. I am greeted by such a warm face the manager Glenn I let him know my situation and he takes care of me without question with a personal note sign sealed delivered by himself for me to be able to come and enjoy the buffet another day. If I ever come to another buffet I will go to the aria the staff is unbelievably warm personable and kind,! Your dinner will be more than memorable,!",

They have a fantastic selection of high quality and fresh items, including Alaskan King Crab Legs, Roast Turkey, Leg of Lamb, to name a few.The highlight would have to be the desserts which were equivalent to those you would find at any good fine dining establishment. Would have given them a higher rating if the admission was more reasonably priced.",

    "text": "Eeeekkkk!!! Is not enough....Terrible, disgusting, and downright bad for your health. Why is there no \"Zero Stars\"? Took a chance on this buffet because it was the new thing on the strip and they had crab everyday. Walked around before buying the buffet, food looked good; well presented and fresh. Boy, were we wrong!!! The food was awful, insipid, and not fresh at all. Waitstaff was arguing about who had which table, no one took our drinks for over ten minutes, and when they did they forgot what we ordered. The pork loin at the carving station tasted like little smokies, the carne asada was dry and didn't have any seasoning, the sushi rolls were sticky and had some unidentifiable mushy fish product, the tortellini tasted like spagetti o's ,  the crab (how can anyone mess up crab!?!?)  was so soggy that when gently squeezed water poured onto the plate, and the shrimp cocktail was old and mushy. I tried to be nice, but finally gave up and asked for my money back. Apparently the manager was pretty used to this cuz he didn't look at all surprised.  Traumatized by our eating experience we went back to our hotel thinking our ordeal was behind us. How wrong we were... Next day husband wakes up feeling \"off\"... diarrhea, severe cramps, and to top off our experience a trip to the hospital. Thanks Aria, your disgusting eating experience is something that we will get to experience for days with a course of antibiotics for the bacterial infection that you shared with us...",

    "text": "I just went to the dinner buffet last week and that's the first time we tried Aria buffet. The prime rib and salmon weren't so good. And actually the one who served the prime rib was not courteous and I ended up complaining to the manager for that. I saw the chef cooking up a piece of prime rib for another customer but was reluctant to do so for me and my husband. I felt that his service wasn't consistent and impolite to us (while we were requesting nicely) so I had to complain to the manager. I understand it's a buffet, not a steak house, but service is still a matter regardless what kind of cuisine a restaurant is serving. So that's a big minus for us. The manager was very nice to help us out to get our prime rib grilled. We had to have the prime rib grilled because we don't eat rare or medium rare meat, and the prime rib was at most medium rare at the time we were eating there. And I think we got compensated by being charged for 1 person instead of 2 due to the unpleasant experience. So it's well resolved that way.  The desserts are great though regardless the unpleasant experience with the prime rib chef. The desserts are great and I had a lot of them. The buffet description said they have the desserts from Jean Philippe Patisserie. So I ate alot of the desserts that seemed to be from Jean Philippe Patisserie (but I really couldn't tell which one was and which one wasn't).  Anyway, it's good to at least try it once and see if we wanna go again. And we probably might not go there again for full price. I do like the dessert but I think I would rather just get them from Jean Philippe Patisserie downstairs, probably cost less that way and still satisfy my craving for Jean Philippe Patisserie desserts.",

I went on Sunday, so was either lunch or brunch.  30 minute wait to get in at 11:30AM..  I did not like this at all, but wanted to see the buffet..  taken to table and ambience is basically a big cafeteria. Food is not presented well, served from \"windows\" cut out of a wall.. very cafeteria like.  Many tables are empty.. which I take means Aria staff pace the line vs. over-stuffing the buffet line.  Biggest line was for the crab legs.  I am not a crab connosseir but I enjoyed them.  They are served cold/ice with lime/lemons vs. hot/steamed.  Breakfast burrito, believe it or not, was very good.  So was the thick sliced bacon (a very nice touch).  Hash browns were bland, dry, bricks.  Omelette station was there.  Eggs benedict too too buttery, but otherwise nicely done.  Desserts were very good.  I wish i tried to eat more in retrospect.   I was offput by the presentation I guess.. I assumed the chinese food was not going to be good until I read these reviews...   Server bought OJ and bloody mary's often and cleared plates quickly and really did try hard.  I am glad I tipped the full 20% before being seated.. I would have not liked tipping 20% and then being left thirsty etc. or with dirty plates laying around.",

Now I have seen 2 and 3 stars here for this place. If you can't spend $27 on dinner or don't like upscale food, its not the place for you.  I can only say that the food taste like a gourmet restaurant, rather then your run of the mill buffets, don't get me wrong, I love Spice Market Buffet and the likes, but the Aria is a step above. They may not have as many dishes as the other, but what they lack in quantity they make up for in quality! Did I say that out loud? I never, I say never go for quality over quantity, but the Aria is worth it. We don't like fru fru foo foo restaurants, and this is not. Even my wife likes it. For that to come our of her mouth (the words,  not the food) is saying something. OH, BTW, the pictures of the crab legs are making me hungry right now. I never order crab legs at a restaurant, but when I'm in Vegas, I get my fill of shell fish for the entire year. They are the largest I have seen at a buffet. But be warned, they may charge more on the weekends, as some do, as they have lobster on those nights.",

Ironic as it may sound we actually went there because the portions everywhere else were so un-appetisingly enormous (well except Picasso, bellagio - see sep review) that we just had to go somewhere where we could put a nice normal portion on our plates and eat it, rather than a plate of food that would feed a family of five for a week. We were not holding out much hope. I have to say we were very pleasantly surprised! The value for money was exceptional (around 12-15) for a really decent standard of food and well cooked to boot.  The selection on offer ranged from sushi to roasts, to french and Indian, all pretty authentically cooked (a bit of a revelation for vegas!). We were having a day off the booze so cannot comment on the wine - but the wine inclusive deal was very reasonable. The surroundings were pleasant, the selection of food utterly enourmous and there were not too many people. Probably the most decent meal we ate in Vegas, all in all. It must be very heavily subsidised by the casino - it is a fairly new, modern 5 star, so I think they need to get people in the casino. Yes, I'd recommend this plce ( I can't believe I'm recommending an all you can eat buffet, but there you go, you have to hand it to them!).",

So at those rates I expected a lot and I'm sorry to say I was highly disappointed. The server we had was not the best. The lobster was small and over cooked. It was so soft I could crack the shell with my bare hands. The highlight of my buffet experience at Aria were the cuts of meats. The skirt steak, prime rib, and brisket were delicious, very tender. The pork & beef ribs were dry.  Sushi selection was basic and the other selections were simple. They have a special oven that cooks Indian Naan bread which was very good and the tandoori chicken was very moist. I've been to many Las Vegas buffets n Aria does not make my top 5 list. For them to call it a gourmet dinner is misleading. The presentation wasn't even gourmet. So if you're in Vegas and willing to spend $40.00 for a dinner buffet, try The Wicked Spoon at The Cosmopolitan which is a walk across the bridge.  That's more gourmet, just no lobster.",

    "text": "You know the buffet drill: bring your least tightest fitting pants and shirts preferably sweats and a plain white t-shirt or colored t-shirt since you're probably going to fall victim to a rogue spicy tuna roll or a bombardment of butter from you copious amounts of crab legs.  The first roadblock to someone attending a Vegas buffet is cost. The Aria Buffet is reasonably priced at $32 for a non-alcoholic buffet and $36 for a bottomless champagne or bloody mary attachment. Um, if you're wincing at the $4 dollar difference, than you're probably not a drinker or have been hit hard by the gambling bug and do not want to open your wallet further than it already has been.  The 2nd part of a buffet equation is the quality and amount of choices given to a diner. Now, it is most certainly a form of gluttony and excess (what Vegas does in abundance...). The Buffet at The Aria gives you plenty of choices from bahn mi and soba noodles to the quintessential crab legs. There is a glorious carving station that offers mahi mahi, prime rib, ham, and turkey. You can also brunch it up with a French toast and pancake section. You want warm fruit nestled in sauce for your pancakes or French toast? No problem! Scrambled eggs w/o gluten more your thing, well, they have that as well!  The standout of this trip to the buffet, though, is the bottomless champagne. My friends and I made sure we were always with flutes of mimosas. The waitress was ever-so-generous and she was as attentive w/o being overtly pressuring. She kept the birthday weekend going and she deserved every bit of the generous tip we left her.  After nom nom noming our way through copious amounts of food items, we settled and conquered the dessert section. This place is immaculate! From cherry cheesecake to a bounty of cookies, this dessert section is one of the brighter sides of the buffet.  From attentive service to reasonably priced Vegas buffet, the Aria houses a great option for those staying and for those looking for an alternative to the long lines @ Wicket Spoon or Bacchanal. I recommend it for all those looking for a buffet to conclude or begin one's Vegas trip.",

Everything was well laid out and tastefully displayed. The food stations were kept clean and restocked. On all 3 visits our wait staff kept our table clear and drinks filled. The dining areas were kept very clean and clear. The Aria's Buffet is exactly what I expect from a Upper end Vegas Buffet. Nothing outrageous but nothing nasty.

After I waved to her, she told us to wait in line to pay first without realized that my wife was standing behind me hold the receipts. She gave no greeting, smile or eye contact to us. When I told her we paid and I stayed in the skysuite with a Noir card, she rolled her eyes and waved to us to another hostess to sit us. This is not a cheap buffet. It is in a 5 diamonds resort. Unacceptable service. Positive side is overall food is good.",

The place is more friendly but also more upscale. The food is easier to access.  The menu is not dramatically different from before but there are some new additions. It appeared to me that they were doing their best to copy the buffet at the Cosmopolitan Hotel.   There was a nice wide selection. The problem? 50% of the things I selected were either downright cold or lukewarm - maybe tepid. The other 50% ranged from warm to almost hot.  It appears it's not possible (at least at the Aria) to serve hot food on a buffet.   The prices are in line with other upscale buffets in the area. The food while cold, did have very nice flavors. The chef knows what he/she is doing. There were some very nuanced dishes - very sophisticated for a buffet.   I will give it another try but if they can't sort out the cold food problem by the next time I visit, my wallet and I will be moving on to one of the other 100 buffets in Vegas.",

We would not eat here again, the prime buffet (and were not big on buffets) would be Cesar Palace - this is the gold standard buffets for us at the time of writing this review.   Aria had a nice atmosphere - good music, bright lights, a few choices, decent wait staff, but the food leaves much to be desired. A few options I tried were: prime rib, chicken, crab legs, fish and chips, caprese salad and many others. On the desert side I tried the butter scotch mini dessert, ice cream, pane cotta and few others. Maybe it was bad (in my opinion) because we ate late 9:30ish but even there the dinning room was packed and the food was mediocre at best. I ordered regular tea and my Wife had the rasberry tea which she said was good.  One interesting thing was the alcohol special advertised - $12.99 for endless selection of wine, beer etc not a bad deal in vegas.   We will not be back.",

If they want to collect some cash to offset what I ate, they'd better see the Blackjack dealers downstairs!   ;)  Everything on this buffet is great. Yes, the King Crab Legs are a little smaller than a \"seafood restaurant\" may serve, so you just go back for 2nds, 3rds, 4ths, 5ths, etc. The desserts are clearly gourmet and house made.   We did my sister's wedding rehearsal dinner here for a group of 70 and I cannot tell you how amazing the staff was. The pricing was excellent, they included a whole lobster for each guest and they were organized and prepared.  I've been back 2 times since that rehearsal and this is totally on my Vegas \"must do\" list every time.",

What I mean is that certain nice hotels will have decent (maybe even mediocre) and some mediocre hotels will have amazing buffets.  With that said, I hate giving Aria buffet such a low review but I think the one thing that is missing at this spot is what most other buffets already offer at the same price offer.  The food across most buffets are very similar, so at times you're making a call on how things taste and how they're prepared.    Most of the things that we ate at this buffet were \"okay\".  I hate saying that b/c maybe the particular day I went things were off.  I get it.  But to have every dish and every station be mediocre is not a coincidence.  I thought the days of subpar buffets like the one that used to exist in the Monte Carlo were gone.    My buddy paid for the meal entirely and I felt bad b/c the food just wasn't good.  The moment we walked in it wasnt even at 15% capacity on a weekend.  Is that normal?  I think some major changes need to happen here before I ever return.  Bacchanal still takes the cake as far I'm concerned.",

The Mexican station was better than Mission joints: Salty Pozole and fatty delicious Chile Verde. Warm tortillas. Yellow rice. Mmm! The Asian half of the buffet was hugely varied - Korean broth, Chinese stir-fry, Thai noodles. Yes!   Pizza, pasta, creative mini-servings of classics like Shrimp n Grits and paella, massive carving station.   With a bit more attention to service, this would've been heaven (or 5 stars).

Try their pork belly and here's a tip - Add some to your ramen to make the broth more flavorful.  Our server was attentive and friendly.  Enjoyed their selection of desserts and gelato.  Unlimited thai iced tea!  Nice.  Cons - waited in line for over 30 mins and the restaurant wasn't even full.  Wish the quality of their Asian section was better...fried rice, sweet and sour pork?  Price point is a tad too high.  Was expecting a little more variety, but still giving 4 stars since I enjoyed my meal overall.",

My drinks was always filled up and my table was always clean! Good jobs!  The foods is little about the average Vegas buffets. Good salad bar, good dessert. Seafood is okay. The BBQ section has more selections then most of the buffets. But the Chinese sections is not as good as the rest. In particular the Dim Sum, it is awful! So you can skips the Dim Sum! Lol!  I like The Buffet at ARIA dinning area and the clean and nice table setup. I can be very comfortable to enjoys my foods and drinks! I wish they have better Chinese foods!",

We arrived on a Saturday around 7 pm, there was absolutely no wait for us & the price was pretty fair considering we paid over $75 a person the day before at the Caesar's Palace buffet. When we walked in we were seated and drinks were served. The service here compared to other buffets aren't as great, but it didn't bother me much.  I went straight for the meat section & got a serving of lamb chops. One of my favorite items of the night, I came back for seconds. The next stop was the crab legs. There was quite a wait and the selection is not nearly as big as the one in Ceasar's palace buffet, but it was good enough for me to get a full plate. Another interesting section they had was the poki bowl section, you could make your own poki bowl, but when I arrived to this station the lady just looked at me expecting me to know what to do. I just pointed at the things that looked good, but she didn't tell me they had rice or sauce. So this was pretty much a fail for me.   Some down falls here were the soup selections, the pho broth was surprisingly spicy in a weird way. The ramen broth was just okay, it didn't taste like ramen. The sushi section is very limited & not even worth trying. There's an Asian section, but its basically fried or steamed gyozas. Nothing special about that.   Overall the price is good & there is no wait, so I would come back. Dessert selection is pretty big so that's good too.",

I've had better $15 buffets, their meat was way too fat, other foods lacked flavor or just felt wrong texture wise. However the desserts looked amazing... which made it all the more disappointing. Honestly wanted to try everything just to see and we were actually having fun laughing at how they could mess up desserts this badly.

But still enjoy eating those. The desserts are okay. I only ate the seafood so dont know about the other food. Coming back again? Hmmm maybe. There is no line for the king crab so its easier to get. For the snow crab theres a line at first but after like 30 mins there no more line. On the receipt it says you should only stay 2 hours at most, but I stayed like almost 3 hours.",

Here's why:  The hot crab legs was frozen.  Now, the first batch we had was hot and delicious and the second batch we went back came out frozen. I think they were just in a rush.   They were out of plates and utensils (spoons). Every fork we got was bent.  The were also out of bowls. I wanted some Chinese soup and used the Pho soup bowls only to have a Chinese lady tell me they were for the Pho which they were out of beef.   The $19.99 unlimited drinks included flat beer. Not so good.  The gelato bar were out of half of the flavors. No really.  We had to reuse some of our plates since we weren't sure if we had enough to go back with.  I do have to say the grilled meat and vegetables were above delicious. Prime rib and Asparagus were like the best I've had in a while.  Also love that dinner for kids are free with a paying adult.",

We we were there they closed down Asian section and didn't bother to tell us. They were no sign outside the restaurant. They literally have 20% less of food selection while charging the same amount. When asked servers staff what is going on \"don't know\" was the theme answer. My mom asked for a bowl of white rice and they told her that they didn't have any. I mentioned this to the the restaurant supervisor and to say that she didn't care would be an understatements. We typically stayed at Aria and think we may need to rethink that now. Basically if they would just communicate with customers and should consider lower the price during renovations, I would be less bitter.",

    "text": "Ooookaaay... I spent a ton of money here to feed 4 people and though the food was good, I really don't think it was worth 200 dollars. I realize you pay for location and experience but as a local it's still just a buffet to me. With all that being said, the food really was very good. Thing is you can feed the same 4 people at out of this world local establishments twice for what you pay once here, and have equally as good a food. I'm a local, born and raised, and I went here purely for experience and to see what all the hub bub was about. I mean there's one guy on YouTube that practically lives in this buffet lol. The experience was fun, we had a blast but I'd never pay that much for a buffet on just a night out. It was a treat for the kids backed by a bonus from work. It's actually the only way I'd ever be able to afford to feed a family of 4 here and that says a lot, especially in this day and age. I really can't say the food or experience is worth the price but keep in mind this is only MY opinion and even if they dropped the price 20 dollars, I'd still think it's too much. If you have the dough and just want the experience than I suggest you go for it because it is a lot of fun. If not, venture out to other establishments around the valley and eat just as good for 1/2 the cost.

    "text": "One of the better buffets on the Strip. There's several highlights (meat, tandoori, latin specialties, desserts), but much of the rest is pretty hum drum, and the East / SE Asian selections are downright bad.  I went for the \"brunch\" offering (cheaper than dinner), which runs from 9am-3pm. My thoughts:  * Indian / Tandoor specialities: Very solid. Good naan, lamb curry, rice, chicken. Probably the best thing here. * Latin: Some reasonable takes on LatAm dishes. * Carving Station: Good, but non-high-end meats. Sausage better than expected. * Mini-desserts: Better than expected. I liked their panna cotta. * Omelette and Waffle stations: Probably a waste of appetite at this price point. * Pho bar: Nice idea, will try next time. * Dumplings and fried rice: Seriously inferior to Trader Joe's. Don't bother.  * Thai beef: Was terrible. Poorly seasoned, some odd non-traditional vegetables, and none of the potent flavors that Thai cooking normally has.  Buffets have a tough balancing act-- food that keeps, that can be made in bulk, that people will want to eat, while keeping the price attractive. People tend to eat at buffets because they of how fast and casual it can be, how it's relatively cheap, the variety, and providing options for all the picky eaters in the group.  Aria does a fine job of balancing these things. Like all buffets, it's not the best versions of the dishes being served, but for the price and the convenience, it's solid. I liked Wynn's buffet better, but it's substantially more expensive.",

    "text": "Writing an update - we've been back 3 times since my initial review, always for dinner.    My opinion remains the same, for Vegas buffets, and I've been to ALOT of them, this ranks very high IMO for quality.  The price reflects that ($39), its about as expensive as they get.  And I really appreciate that MLife Pearl gets to use the 'special line', it made me feel.....special! :)  Asian dishes, the best i've seen for a buffet.  Real ingredients, real recipes.  Yummy soup.  Pho station (or was it Udon?) i forget :)  The snow crab, dang good, and theyre pretty good at keeping it filled as this is the star of the show here.  Grateful they dont saw these in half (which ruins it) like other buffets do.  While you're at this station, look on the other side, there is a 'hidden' gem, Oysters Rockefeller cooked to order (or they might have some made for you).  Steamed clams/mussels, and rock crab claws (you might want to 'try' 1 or 2 before you take a pile of these, they are called rock crab for a reason!)  So enter my only gripe: crustacean seafood is messy, working with your hands, for a $40 buffet, you should be able to ask for (or have them given to you by your server) Moist Towelettes!!  We shouldnt have to run to the restroom just to wash hands.   The Prime Rib was reliably fantastic.  Medium rare and tender.  Salad bar - check, good, lots of decisions to make.    Our servers each time have been delightful, and thorough.  I always leave a nice tip based on the total value of the meal (i.e., if you're comped, you still should leave a tip based on comped value).  And, still a big fan of the dessert array, I thought it was one of the best I've seen at a Vegas buffet,  EVERYTHING i tried was delicious.  Burnt cream, cheese cake, black forest cake, a scrumptious white choc chip cookie, etc.  The clientele here, generally well dressed - so I wouldnt show up in gym shorts/t-shirts.  For a buffet, I think they've executed it pretty well, far better than most, so by comparison to other buffets it gets 4 stars.",

The staff is doing a halfway job on food prep & service. Although I'm adding a star for the floor staff (wait staff & bus service), they are hardworking and pretty friendly. I plan on making a complaint to the manager.   I guess their thought is; if you pass up all their quality restaurants to eat in a buffet, your standard for food must be low. This is ridiculous! I wish I had taken a Lyft to one of the buffet suggestions I found on YouTube. We were here for 5 days & everyday we had good meals; on our last day we missed big time.   Don't eat at this buffet! They have watery grits & oatmeal; undercooked bacon; cold sausage; what tastes like day old chicken fried steak. The seafood was good & I figure our money went there even though it wasn't as good as the seafood dinner we had earlier this week.",

    "text": "Came in Saturday night for holiday pricing and the price really wasn't worth it. I stayed at Aria so the buffet was conveniently close to the elevators (Level 2 in Promenade). I remembered dining at this buffet when it first opened and I was so happy back then because the food was great. Now...it seems different sadly.    Waited about half an hour at 5:10pm. There were plenty of tables available, so I think they controlled the amount of people entering so that there would be a steady flow of customers leaving the place.   Anyhow, the only good food they had was the seafood section and grilled vegetables.   The halibut was fresh and oyster wasn't bad at all (no strong fishy smell).   Grilled vegetables was absolutely phenomenal. Well seasoned and I was such a huge fan of the asparagus that I always came back for more. They did serve a burnt tomato....honestly please just throw that away. No customer should be served burnt food.   Soups in Asian section was incredibly lacking. Flavors were off.   Crab legs were also great and fresh, but too salty for my taste.   It has only been a few days since I've dined there. I already forgot some of the food that I ignored either because it didn't look appetizing or I can't remember the dishes I tried since the taste was just average. Well, sadly that's why my experience was \"A-OK\", a 3-star experience. I'm not sure if I will return when there are other buffets on the strip that also have good reviews like Bacchanal or Wicked Spoon, but I hope they improve and go back to the wonderful buffet that it was many years ago.",

It was a week day about 3pm and there was not that many customers around (less than half of the tables were seated) and yet it took 20 minutes to get seated!  Selection of food is broad, from Asian, salads, Carving station (my favorite) to seafood and desserts! While food is good, it is not anything special to Vegas, and more of an average offering!  I was excited to see Spanish Paella but was full of shell bits making it non eatable!   Dessert station was good and Ice Cream offering was particularly good!!!  In summary-pretty average buffet!!!",

When we (2 adults and 1 kid) finally got a table, we were delighted to find that the food selection was pretty damn AMAZING! Sure, there are the normal buffet staples (crab, prime rib,etc), but I also saw a pho/udon station, a burrito station and so much more. There were some items like the braised short ribs on mashed potatoes and salmon with some type of salsa that looked like miniature versions of a plate you'd get at a  fine dining establishment- amazing presentation. Now, let me get to the bad part besides the wait that tarnished the experience a bit. Our server was slow! I don't expect much service at a buffet, only my plates cleared once in a while, and my water filled. That's all! My (tiny) water cup got re-filled only once, and this was after I had asked 3 times. She wasn't rude or anything, just busy clearing tables the whole time. Don't they have any bussers? This was in stark contrast to the Bellagio buffet we had gone to the night prior, where we didn't have to ask for anything. We had paid the tip before we were seated, and I regret leaving her a $20 tip for such lousy service. The table in front of us were also irritated and left her a cash tip of $3. Lol. I am glad that I had decided against the all you can drink because I definitely would not have gotten my money's worth on that one. Overall, I'd definitely visit this buffet again just for the bomb food.",

Saturday at 3:00, not exceptionally busy. A lot of the items looked old, filmed over, dry, you know the look. I wasn't compelled to try most of it. There were two excellent curries.   The carving station had three meats and only one was delicious. The carver-dude manning the station was a trip. He said \"prime rib, steak and roast beef\" were the selections. I asked for prime rib. He starts cutting a small slab of meat that doesn't look remotely like prime rib. He says it's sirloin. I point out the largest hunk of beef, he says it's \"steamship\". It was the only beef he had that looked medium and it was the only tender meat I got. I ask about the 3rd meat and he said it was tri tip. Got a slice of that and it was too tough, cut incorrectly.   The seafood station had an impressive array of crab legs, crab claws and shrimp. There was a gentleman standing under the sign that says \"made to order\" so I asked what he made to order. He gestured back toward the chilled selection and said it was all there. I asked what did the sign refer to that says \"made to order\". He said he had oysters rockefeller so I asked for that. He reluctantly pulls out a pan, pulls back the foil and plates two for me. I'm still not sure what the hell that sign is supposed to mean.   I saw 3 different tables leave a huge mess and zero tip. INFURIATING. The servers are bringing you drinks and extra napkins and clearing plates. TIP these people!",

First off, don't even bother using GPS to find self parking. I typed in Aria and it brought me to the registration area with no signs whatsoever for self park. I only found out two days later the Aria self parking is near the entrance to Crystals SMH. So cool how both buffets I went to this past weekend were orange in decor. Aria & Wicked Spoon are rocking my fave color!  $37 +tax/tip for Thursday dinner wasn't bad. Tess was our cashier and she kindly mentioned diners earn   points on their player's card, which can be redeemed for a buffet meal. $10 off for NV/Vegas residents! Our waitress, Luz, is super friendly AND hardworking-- she was the only one working in our area, constantly taking away used plates, busing her tables, wiping them down, placing new cloth napkins & silverware, warm smile never faltering.   Food! A variety of stations, the usual American, seafood on ice (crab legs, shrimp, crab claws, 2 kinds of mussels, clams), a bit of pasta, Mexican & Asian fare, surprisingly had Indian and Mediterranean options. I saw a few curries and basmati rice. The dessert bar had a spinning ice cream display. Most buffets I've visited have linguica sausage and hand carved meats. Wedge salads! Blue cheese dressing tho.   My plates had:  Mushroom & truffle pizza New England clam bake-- have never eaten that many clams before! Shrimp & grits Paella-- Latin rice dish with mixed shellfish, sausage Sauteed string beans Carnitas Creamed spinach cheese? Dip with crunchy chips!! Freshly baked naan! I added garlic hummus & tzatziki.  *Thai tea and watermelon lime strawberry juice were offered at the buffet the day I went! Just missing honey boba pearls for the Thai tea.   I probably won't stop by again unless someone in my group wants crab legs, but if you're staying at Aria, definitely grab a meal here before braving the Strip.",

Another pro about this place is that they have ice cream and gelato. The creme brulee was amazing. Service was great our waiter was very friendly. I will definitely visit this buffet when in Vegas again.",

But a lot of their food was sitting out, not getting tossed or freshened. There was a line for the crab legs, they need to figure out a new method cause it was ridiculous. Finally went to eat them and they were really salty. It was the cheap snow crab too I was expecting a higher quality of crab for being a buffet on the strip and being higher price since it was Friday. Won't go back... will do more research on better buffets on the strip.",

The location is convenient since the Aria is roughly at the center of the strip. The price of $30 after tax for lunch is not bad, especially if you come around 2 something and stay until they switch to their dinner menu, which will all be fresh! Overall, I would say this is probably the most economical buffet on the strip, when considering cost, quality of food, and wait time.  As for the food, the carving station and the desserts are probably your best bet. The Red Velvet Nutella Pancakes are probably my favorite. The Eggs Benedict are usually cooked pretty well. The seafood station is borderline ok. The Asian station is dismal.",

The carving station at this buffet has a decent variety of meats and I enjoyed their steak. The buttermilk mashed potatoes and roasted veggies in this section were also delicious. The next section had both Mexican & Indian dishes which were quite good. I enjoyed the Indian chicken curry with naan and the Mexican corn was super flavourful! That was actually one of the highlights of this meal and I could've gone back for more if not for the fact that I wanted to try everything.   Now this is where the rest of the buffet went downhill. The seafood section was disappointing. The prawn cocktail didn't taste that fresh, the crab legs I had were cold and the clams were gritty. Wasn't impressed. Don't even get me started on the Asian food section. The Har Gow was pretty gross and rubbery and I didn't care much for the other dim sum options. The dessert fared better with this one raspberry tart that I loved and of course, you can't go wrong with fresh fruit including a selection of cantaloupe, watermelon and pineapple.  Overall, for the price ($29) it was decent but c'mon you're in Vegas, you can find better buffets.",

Not sure if this is standard for the US and we are a bit spoiled as Europeans, but this was dissapointing for a 3 star all-inclusive beach resort. For a 5 star Las Vegas resort this buffet is just (far) below par.  Quality: 2/5 Qantity: 1/5",

I'm not a buffet connoisseur by any means, but this does not compare to Wicked Spoon in the slightest (not that I think it's trying to, but - still, that's the comparison I can make).  Even though the place was mostly empty, there was a pretty odd artificial queue in place. I get them not wanting to just let a thousand people hit the buffet all at once...but...still seemed strange.  Once seated, we were unleashed to do our damage. The food spread seemed to me very heavily tilted towards lunch/afternoon/dinner foods, honestly, with pizza, dumplings, even Mexican and Indian food. The variety was nice, but I think I would have liked more breakfast options...maybe I somehow missed them? I will call out that the lamb korma was surprisingly good for hotel buffet Indian food - nice tender flavorful lamb.  On the other hand, there were drinks stations (one with Thai iced tea that I really wanted to try) but no glasses to be found anywhere. I finally located some about the size of a thimble and just decided to skip the effort. Even getting water to the table took until about halfway through the meal, so maybe their queue was to limit impact on a too-small amount of staff?  I do want to call out their French macarons, which were excellent - fresh and tender with chewy shells. They also had \"mountain yuzu\" sorbet or gelato which was so so good - I'm obsessed with yuzu, so I was very pleasantly surprised to find it randomly at this buffet.  Price was, I thought, high, but so is everything in Vegas. My 3 star review means \"I'll come back\"...and...I guess I would come back...but...man, it would be a tough choice. I wouldn't say \"never\" but I would definitely try a lot of other options first...hence the very weak 3.",

Food is not as delicious as the bacchanal and wicked spoon--save your money and go to other buffets. The wait time is also ridiculous. We went for dinner around 245, did not get seated til 415. Many empty tables, but they take a long time seating people due to being understaffed according to the lady at the cash register. Only one person at the cash register. Paid for our meal in front, and still had to wait for another 20mins to get seated. I just do not get the logic why take so many people when there's not enough servers to accommodate the people. If only I can rate this as a zero, I would. If you still decide to eat here out of curiosity, make sure you bring some snacks while in line to prevent headache from hunger. Coming here with an empty stomach to make the most out of your money will make you faint from hunger. Also, they try to limit your stay for 2 hours.",

For starters, we had the holiday brunch buffet and first and foremost, we enjoyed the wait staff. Friendly service with some holiday humor is always welcomed.  Now, why 3 stars? Its tough being a buffet that is culturally diverse, but the biggest offender towards their food was the freshness of each selection. Some examples; stale/burnt/stiff waffles, cold chicken; incredibly soggy dimsum, curry was overcooked where the potato made it more mashy than curry; stale nan; pho...just forget about it.  Secondly, please invest some time into putting up the correct signs for the dish. Also signs that says \"etm_009\" for crab legs does not tell us much. Some people may come here with the promise of cultural diverse meal but won't mean anything if they don't know what they're eating.  However, the wait staff were amazing. Our waiter made sure our table was always clean and cups were filled. The staff at the dessert station were even more awesome as they accommodated our request to torch our creme brulee, which by the way makes all the difference.  A year ago, this buffet was worth trying out and we'd make recommendations to friends. However now? I'd say save your belly real estate for another buffet. 3 star verdict is an average between 5 star (last year) and 1 star (this year).",

    "text": "First of all, this buffet has been revamped as of early 2013, so don't let the ratings fool you. They've added two new stations: Fish Market and Latin to bring a total of 11 stations. Of course, it's always a wiser choice to eat buffets during lunch on a weekday, and it's even better when your mom has free passes because she likes to gamble. But if I had to pay that day, it would have been $22.99 for a Friday lunch buffet. I really didn't think this buffet was that far off from Bacchanal at Caesar's Palace. I paid over $50, albeit dinner, for Bacchanal a few months ago, and I left just as satisfied.  Their Asian section is not as good as Bacchanal's, but they do have a few dim sum goodies. I was surprised that their chicken & waffles were really good. Waffles were moist and the chicken was tender and juicy. Another surprise I found were dried mangoes in their cheese section. I've never seen dried mango at a buffet before, and you can bet I snagged a few in my purse for the road. Dried mangoes - my weakness. They also had really fresh smoked salmon, which I made a lox bagel with their assortment of cream cheese.   Dessert was amazing, although I am biased because I have a sweet tooth. I pretty much love all pastries. On average, I spend close to half my time at the dessert bar, unless it's just terrible. The dessert bar here is comparable to Bacchanal's. They had a large assortment of pastries from chocolate and almond croissants, to blueberry crumble muffins. Their coconut macaroons were so moist and decadent. The only disappointing thing would be their ice cream. They have a good variety, but it just didn't taste very creamy. It was a bit puffy, like a little too airy or something. Overall, I really liked this buffet and would recommend this over Bacchanal; it's just a better deal.",

They had an omelette station with the coolest chef who was kicking out made to order omelettes like nobody's business!  There was also seafood, salad, chinese food, fruit, cheese, oatmeal, french toast, giant pancake, breakfast meats, etc etc.  Really there was quite a lot!    Would definitely come back the next time we are in Vegas.",

    "text": "I was at the Aria buffet in its first incarnation and I liked it a lot.  I was surprised when some trashed it so much, so I was glad when MGM Resorts announced they were closing the buffet and re-doing it.  Yesterday I had the chance to try it since the redo.  It's basically the same place with a few modest changes and perhaps the addition of a few stations.  First the good--the prime rib was cooked nicely with it being a nice red rare.  The vegetable korma in the Tandoori section was quite good.  The chicken tikka masala was OK, but it needed more spice.  The seafood gumbo was quite nice.  I wish I had noticed the basmati rice in the tandoori section first.  I would have put some rice in the bowl and then added the gumbo.  The cheese bar was very nice with some dried fruit with the cheese.  The desserts were outstanding!!  A few lesser dishes.  The bao sandwich was not good at all.  The lovely steamed roll had dried hard from sitting warming for however long it was there.  The pork in the bun was kind of bland making this a fail choice.  There were some different bread selections but not a wide range to choose from.  The chicken satay was merely OK.  The peanut sauce was way too runny and didn't have a lot of flavor.  When you're paying $36.74 for dinner buffet, the shrimp should be PEELED.  I didn't have any because this is an onerous task for me.  Now the desserts.  While there was nothing exotic or earth shaking, they had some very nice small desserts.  I'm a sucker for meringue cookies and they had a fruit flavored one.  It was delightful!  I also had two of their mini whoopie cookies--one a snowball (chocolate cake with coconut) and one made from red velvet.  The cream filling was very good.  The gelato selection is good and I had the Oreo gelato.  Nice and creamy.  This isn't a buffet to which I'd likely return.  For the price, there are better buffets on the Strip with some very good selections.  Also for the price, I think I'd pay a little more and eat at one of Aria's fine selection of restaurants!",

    "text": "Here we are... another place Yelp would lead you to believe isn't very good.  The Buffet at ARIA was very good for a buffet. After seeing Zarkana and having been starving all day, I was feeling a bit nauseous and felt as though I was going to throw up all over (though I'm not sure how, having not eaten much at all). I wound up getting two full plates of food and dessert at ARIA and felt A-OK. So hey, at least I didn't get food poisoning! Always a plus after having food from a buffet.  This buffet is the biggest I've ever eaten at... there's an insane amount of options from a bunch of different cuisines. Chinese, Mexican, Japanese, American, and Indian that I can think of off the bat. I didn't have any of the Chines food, but the Mexican was good, the sushi was decent, the American food above average, and the Indian food also really tasty.  The best part about my visit? Probably when my girlfriend's dad asked for peanut butter gelato with chocolate and nuts on top, but was given mango gelato with chocolate and nuts on top. That just about made my night.  Sure, the service is a bit slow (as seems to be a theme at Vegas buffets), but it's adequate enough. I appreciated that our foreign waitress was late to our table because she said she had to pee. Most people would probably be grossed out by that, but I appreciated the honesty!",

    "text": "Monday visit, and right at 12:50 pm. This is my first time and last visiting the Aria buffet. I waited approximately 45 minutes from the time I entered the line and was seated. The wait time was what I had expected.   The waitress received my drink order immediately following when I was seated. The waitress came back about 7 minutes later and asked again what I would like to drink. Another 3 minutes passed until the water was served. She did however bring me two of them so this was helpful.  I tried a sample portion of each of these. Aside from the shrimp and a crab legs and claws which I had several of.   The rest of the reviewers are correct in their description of the hot crab legs and cold ones. They were very watery and the flavor was ehhhh. The cooked chilled shrimp were perfectly cooked and the shell pre-sliced at the mud vein for easy access. Their wasn't any boil mix added to it that I could taste.   The crawfish were on part for every single buffet I have ever been to. Bland, overcooked, dead ones cooked as well, and definitely not presoaked to make them purge. There was zero boil mix added to them for flavor. They were extremely muddy flavored. I really don't understand how so many restaurants can manage to screw up something which can so easily be made by taking an extra hour of time to prepare. They difference between what they all seem to do and the few extra steps and time it takes to prepare them properly is night and day in flavor. Oh well, I always have my people in Louisiana for excellent crawfish. The corn on the cob was overcooked and also had very little flavor.   The chorizo sausage, and chicken jalapeno sausage were extremely dry.   The chicken had a decent breading on it but was also overcooked.   The carved chicken and turkey were very moist.   The cashew chicken was made in a style which if I hadn't known I would have said it was made by someone at their house and not a restaurant.  The broccoli beef was grisly, and one of the worst flavored I have tasted.   The custard bun dough was perfectly cooked but very bland custard in the center.   I am not sure how they managed to screw up an apple pie, but they did. The bread pudding as well. Both had no real flavor, definitely didn't have much cinnamon in either, not much sugar either (think diabetic bland.) This is the first place I have ever been where the apple pie was so below average I couldn't finish it. It looked like they added pine nuts into the bread pudding.   The pot said it was chicken soup but it tasted like ground up rice in water.  The lamb ossobuco the broth was fabulous. But the lamb was not cooked properly so it was tough and chewy.   Synopsis: Even for the slightly lower price then other casino buffet for lunch $25.99, it was no where worth the price. If you need and like foods which are prepared with no spices or few if any, like dessert which is diabetic sugar free tasting, food which is about 15%-25% overcooked, seafood which is water logged, then this will be a smash hit with you.",

The buffet is moderately priced, has a variety of culinary options (in particular a great pick for seafood lovers), and is extremely convenient. What takes away from your buffet and will impact if I return is the buffet line. For lunch, we waited over 40 minutes to get into the restaurant.

First off, the place was empty and we got seated in the far back. Even the waiter made a comment. The food had been sitting out wayyyy too long guys!! Cheese chunks should not be dried out on the outside, and potstickers shouldn't be hardened. The meat station was pretty good, but salad station didn't seem that fresh and was lackluster. I think a disadvantage to both customers and the restaurant is when things are slow. When things are slow, food stays out too long and therefore isn't getting refreshed. But I really feel like $47 or so after tip for one person is pretty ridiculous. It's gotten so expensive to eat in Las Vegas, and you should at least feel like you're getting your moneys worth. I wish we could have received a partial refund to be honest.",

    "text": "My legs grew wary as I stood on the long line at the Buffet, pangs of hunger hitting me here and there. It was a Wednesday night at 7:30 PM. An hour later, my prayers to the food gods were answered and we were finally seated. We were a party of 3 and paid $34.99 each. Feel like getting drunk? Get the bottomless drinks for $12.99 each.   The place itself was clean and service was efficient after being seated. I wasted no time. I swiftly ran to the bathroom to wash my hands and went straight to the first station I saw: Asian.   The first plate I got was cashew chicken with fried rice and some Italian chicken along with beef and broccoli. The cashew chicken and beef and broccoli and fried rice were pretty decent but the Italian chicken tasted too much like wine so I didn't finish it. The cashew chicken was too nutty for my taste.   My second plate was crab legs and sushi. The sushi wasn't any greater than other sushi I have tasted (it was spicy salmon) and the snow crab legs were good too. I don't really know how to open crab legs so I probably would've had a better experience if I knew how to open them, haha.   My third plate was spaghetti with marinara and alfredo sauce, shrimp, onions, tomatoes, and mushrooms. I actually finished all of this but it wasn't the best pasta I have had (check out Carmine's in NYC).   My fourth plate was actually dessert because I was waiting for my beef ribs to cook. So instead of just waiting and wasting time, I decided to continue eating. My favorite dessert was the flan; it was absolutely phenomenal. The tiramisu cake sucked so I didn't finish it (way too much espresso). The cheesecake was alright. The cupcakes, yogurt, macaron, and brownie on the stick was ok too. I got chocolate gelato as well...it was meh.  My fifth plate was finally my beef ribs, macaroni and cheese, and mashed potatoes. This was probably my best plate. The mac n cheese and mashed potatoes were delicious. However, the beef ribs could have been cooked more and had more flavor.   Besides all of the stuff I ate, they had a salad bar, pizza, an Indian station, etc.   After consuming all this food, I could not get up and entered into food coma. It took me 2-3 hours to recover.   Overall, I think buffets value quantity over quality but this was one of the better buffets I have been to. However, the food was not particularly phenomenal and didn't get my taste buds dancing. If you're really hungry and what OK food, check it out. I didn't get to check out the Bacchanal Buffet but I know it is also more expensive at $50.  This gets 3 stars because the food wasn't that great and the line was too long, but it was a fair price. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas, but the memory of this bland food will stay with me forever.",

Good thing the table next to us left, i piled it ten high until someone noticed and came to clear the plates.",

    "text": "Im not a buffet person at all. But the friend I was with wanted buffet and their specialty ( or so they claim) is that its a seafood buffet, with option of unlimited champagne ( insert large smile here)  I think that for the price $24 with champagne $31. its great, for those of you that can't spend $24 on buffet at vegas, I don't think you should be in vegas. Or eat at buffalo bill's or its called bills now I think, whatever you get the idea. There is somewhat a variety, to be honest I really just loved the champagne.  Some of the food was good, the only thing I had that I really thought was ridiculous was some sort of meat that was so dry , I couldn't eat it.   The other thing I really thought was great that there was a ton of breakfast options, given the time that my friend I went there, it seems maybe they do breakfast all day. Eggs with hollaindase, regular eggs, potatoes,bacon, sausage, pancakes, etc... overall the experience was fairly good, there are many options for different taste of people and there's dessert ( another star),gelato. Not sure what the new obsession with gelato is , but it seems to be in every corner in vegas, well at least in the more upscale hotels. Are they trying to pretend you're in Italy , I don't know.",

I think it was around $35 for dinner which I did not think was fair because their selection was so small.  I would say that there are much better buffets on the strip but Aria buffet is still better than the really bad ones like Ceaser's Palace's buffet.  But still I've had better food at buffets off the strip.  It is very fancy though, we were each served wine and half of a lobster which was fine but I was bothered by the black clumps that were not cleaned from our lobsters.  It's a nice restaurant but it is still typical for a buffet.  I can't say anything was memorable about this place other than the decor.  Service was kind of shoddy also, they expect tips but they don't provide excellent service.",

    "text": "If this buffet was any place but Vegas it would be a 4 star joint, but my standards goes up once it is Vegas. I consider Vegas, Buffet City! The seating for this buffet is very classy and the decor is bright and fun. I also like how we were surrounded by the food versus the diners surrounding the food. Our server did greet us but failed to let everyone at the table know we each get a half a lobster and complimentary wine. I feel special features like that should be advertised. The night we went we had a choose of Merlot or Chardonnay, I think it may change from time to time.  For the price, I wasn't supper happy with the food.  The lobster was quite delicious and the they had both snow crabs and dungeness (but they were cold). Other than that nothing else in the buffet was memorable or worth really having seconds.  The dessert that I did like was the creme brulee but I love creme brulees and I will say it was nothing special, but still delicious.  Buffets in Vegas are not cheap like you would think. It was $70 for two (not including tip) and that is without ordering any drinks. I also understand its because they give out wine and a half lobster but not everyone wants that (especially for my group, some of the people don't drink wine and some hated lobster).  Overall, it was decent but i know there are way better buffets for the price.",

    "text": "I guess 3 and a half stars is about right. I enjoyed the food but it was pricey. I came to Vegas and we were starving and went to the buffet since we were staying at the Aria. Dinner on a Saturday night was $35 per person. Ouch!  They did have lobster which I'm told isn't served at most buffets and since lobster goes for about 10 bucks per tail, I could see why people were loading up on lobster getting 3-4 a plate.   For a buffet, they do have a decent selection of meats (prime rib, steak, roasted pig, chicken, etcetera. No ham). They had pork chops as well but I can't remember how it was made.   They do have a good selection of seafood, pastas, and desserts and the Aria buffet seems to strive for quality over quantity but I think most of buffets have similar items. The items at Aria are slightly better but I never go to buffets for desserts and a creme brulee is a creme brulee no matter where you go. The desserts look pretty and come in their own plates and they do have a decent selection.  The oddest thing about the restaurant is that it actually shakes. We all thought it was because we all had a long flight and had been starving all day. But it seems either their sound system isn't setup right or they forgot to install some insulation when they built the place. It actually felt like eating during a mild earthquake (around 3.0 on the Richter scale for us Californians :) ).  Service was slow. Our server was nice but we could tell she was really busy despite the fact we arrived really early for dinner (4pm) and the place was not packed. It took awhile before she could back to our table for refills and clear our plates. My opinion on that is that they need to hire more servers because they can't handle the load at the moment.   To summarize: I liked the food alot but it's pricier than most buffets and you could get better deals elsewhere.",

    "text": "What a disappointment.   When I booked our room at the Aria, I let the saleslady talk me into upgrading the room with a free breakfast buffet for the length of our stay. After all, it's the Aria -- a brand new hotel with top-notch ratings for service and quality. Plus, The Buffet at Aria is #5 on the Top 10 Vegas Buffet ratings at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLasVegasDirect.com&s=faa3ed1a34a2281e295883561d4e50aea28b4d38f6dc8434efbef30f88455239\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LasVegasDirect.com</a>. So I came here with high hopes.   It started bad right away. They have 2 cashier's stations for this place, and one of them is often clogged with \"VIPs\" with line-passes, so the line gets long and goes slow. Once you pay, you're held up until they get several tables to seat, and the maitre'd dispatches you with a hostess to drop you at your various tables like a UPS driver on a tight schedule.   The buffet itself is constructed with a wall limiting access to it to a handful of entry/exit points, and also serves to constrict traffic so that you are constantly in the way of or impeded by someone else. The overall sensation is of a herd of cattle being shunted down a chute to the feeding pens or holding floor.   The bakery section is partitioned by glass that goes all the way to the ceiling, so when you try to talk to the buffet worker about what sort of bread or bagel you'd like toasted, it's like talking to a prisoner in \"Midnight Express.\" You can barely hear each other though the glass, and leads to fun miscommunications (e.g.: \"May I have an onion bagel please?\" \"You want an Everything bagel?\" \"Uh, no, ONION please!\" \"Ok, white toast, coming up!\" \"Okay, fine, give it to me.\")   For those lucky enough to get seated near the windows, as another Yelper wrote, you will get sunlight and verdant views of the pool. The rest of you will get exiled to the low-roofed oppressive dungeon, with test-tube lights dangling from the ceiling like Superman's Fortress of Solitude.   The food was uninspired but serviceable. The waitress, when she showed up, was friendly and efficient.   The overall vibe, however, was one of \"we're really busy, so hurry up and get out of our buffet.\" We were more than happy to comply. Skipping the \"free\" breakfast today -- here's hoping Wicked Spoon next door is better.",

It's 38 a person for dinner which is pretty cheap for what they advertised, unlimited wine and a whole Maine lobster. First off the wine was blah. And they were super strict on the serving of the Maine lobster. It was 1 per person and they triple check to make sure you haven't already gotten one. With all of the scrutiny I figure it would be a decent presentation of the lobster. NOPE! Just boiled. It had no flavor. Also it didn't arrive until almost the end of the meal even though we requested it at as soon as we sat down. I started down the buffet line and first things first it was king crab legs, pre split. Which was a definite plus since the spines on the king crab legs are a pain to fight through. They were always low on them and I didn't feel like waiting for more in that terribly long line. I tasted almost all of the other items and it was nothing amazing. The best dish was the lobster ravioli. I did have 2 plates of that.   The service was terrible, the waitress looked pissed off and barely ever cleared our plates and instead of refilling drinks she just brought out new ones, but she only did that once.   Recommendation, come for an early dinner to avoid the crowds, stick to the king crab legs and lobster ravioli.",

I understand this is an all-u-can eat festival but for $40+ it was sub par.  I think you get more for your money at Bellagio's buffet or even the Mirage.

Their dinner buffet comes with a no name wine (chardonnay or Merlot) and lobster (declined...why get lobster in Vegas when I live in New England?). The prime rib was rare, something unattainable at the Wynn. There were some duds (bland veggies and over cooked veal) but a cornucopia of food awaits. I thought the desserts were rather good, especially considering the industrial food production behind the scenes. Finally, it was not insanely crowded as some of the other buffets (Caesars comes to mind). So, if you are in Vegas to imbibe in a bit of old fashioned gluttony, do it in style at Aria.",

    "text": "i swore i was gonna go off  vegas buffets.  for $30 (or i guess double that), i can get better quality food. (there's many michelin star restaurants in vegas!) but then i hadn't tried the buffet at aria yet.  i've tried nearly all the buffets in vegas (that are worth trying): wynn, bellagio, carnival, mandalay bay, paris, orleans, mgm, monte carlo. and this was definitely one of the top. i personally liked wynn and mandalay bay the most, but it was a while ago so i don't know how they compare exactly with this one. but so far, i am pretty impressed with the buffet at aria.  upon entering, i noticed the hefty tag of  $35 on fri/sat for dinner. ouch! but i've never been so i'll check it out. thinking i won't come back again.  Yes the buffet is pricey. service is a little slow, they're short on servers, but she was friendly.  But for an extra $5 you get half a lobster.  Also it's unlimited wine! And for the extra $5 you get lamb, ny steak AND prime rib. as well as turkey and pork. crab legs and HUGE and pretty fresh cocktail shrimps!  they even had salmon nigiri sushi! it didn't look appetizing, but at least it wasn't just california rolls!  honestly, those are the things you pay for a buffet anyways. everything else is filler food. and i actually got SO FULL from all that, i could barely have any filler food.  THEY ALSO HAD MACAROONS!!! it was strawberry flavoured. a little sweet, but not bad nonetheless.   unfortunately they don't have a crepe maker like wynn does. i didn't really get to try the dessert either becasue i was so full o_O  I tried: Half lobster - only one per person. it was alright. a little small, but it's worth $5. a little too creamy for my liking, but hey, it's a lobster!  Crab leg - salted, not bad, not stale or anything, didn't make me feel sick. so i think it's relatively fresh  Shrimp cocktail - my goodness, these are huge and pretty fresh! the best shrimp cocktail i've had from any buffet!  Prime rib - a little fatty, I got the middle part and it was cooked medium  ny steak - i got a pretty thick piece. it was pretty good  lamb - a little dry i think, but it was alright. wish it was a little rarer.  they even had kebabs, which was a little dry. i also tried the salmon salad which was pretty good too.  after all that i was SO STUFFED that i couldn't try anything else. but i think i ate my money's worth. and that's the most important thing to me in a buffet.  so yes, it may be a little steeper, but at least you get your money's worth unlike most buffets where you pay $30 and the only thing worth eating is the shrimp, prime rib and crab legs.  everything looked nicely put together and appetizing, which i realized is pretty important to me after experiencing the wynn buffet. paris, for example, was way too messy, and the food just didn't seem that great.  I'm sad i didn't get to try much of the dessert, so i can't really comment on that.   they also had a made to order pasta, and some of their soup didn't look half bad either.  tip: $35 for fri/sat nights. $22/24? for lunch. so decide what you want to pay for.  favourites: GOOD variety! lamb, prime rib AND ny steak! fresh shrimp cocktail and crab legs PLUS half a lobster! hell yea!!! and unlimited wine ;)  do not want: yes a little steep. you have no option but go for the $35. service is slow  last words: it's definitely one of the top vegas buffets i think. fresh, good variety (not lacking, and worthy of the steep cost) i'll definitely come back again! probably only one time though! then i am officially quitting vegas buffets =p",

The area where it could improve is the Asian section. Like most buffets, they throw in a Mongolian grill that serves up noodles, and calls it authentic.  Do I enjoy it? Absolutely!

Definitely get the beverage pass if you're a big drinker! It's about 13 bucks, I could only finish 1 and a half of a drink!   The only thing I was confused was our waitress, she didnt show up to our table til 15 minutes later, and the busser was the one cleaning our plates the whole time and actually giving us great service. Then our waitress went MIA and 30 minutes later told her manager \"Sorry I was gone for 20 minutes\" (we were sitting near the door where you see the waiters and bussers come out bringing out drinks), yeah she was bad, but our busser was so kind and polite. I wish I knew her name!  Well worth it if you play myVegas!!",

They were also quick to take away our empty plates and refill our drinks.   The food itself was quite disappointing. There was a large variety of food like Mexican, Chinese, Italian, American, and Japanese. However, nothing really caught my attention and were all pretty simple. I might have been spoil by bacchanal. The dessert section was also not that impressive. I don't think I'll be coming back. I find Rio and wicked spoon to be better options.",

    "text": "We were very hungry after driving for more then 4 hours, just checked in to the Aria we didn't want to walk around to find a place to eat.  I was with 4 others who also didn't want to look further, needless to stay buffet was not my first choice and especially this one, I never get my money's worth.  But when hunger strikes you'll eat anything, and we were so hungry buffet sounded good at the time.   Located at Aria's promenade.  It was about $35 per adult for late lunch.  The place is nice, clean, modern, and staff very efficient.  They selection of food was the downfall for me.  I did a walk through before starting, looked pretty good.  Its when I actually started to select food when I thought wow this is not great, my plate was pretty empty.   Buffets I always start with my main dishes.  I went to the craving station got a prime rib and a small slice of leg of lamb, both ok leg of lamb was dry but prime rib was good.  Other options sausages, roasted chicken, and turkey.  I added some side dishes I went to the \"Italian\" section and grabbed some antipasto.  Again nothing special.  Went back to my seat.  Started with that.   They had salad bar, which I usually ignore at buffets but I made a small side salad just to get some veggies in. Italian with a made to order past bar,  pizza so on I skipped, small Indian section about 3 dishes, I grabbed a naan bread and topped it with butter chicken not even worth mentioning, an Asian section with not very appetizing dim sum, dry looking noddles, and the rice even looked sad I skipped this whole section.  They had a \"sushi\" section with 3 different types of roll, this was very disappointing.  The seafood section looked pretty promising crab legs, mussels, prawns so on both hot or cold.  This section is where you'd get your money's worth.  I tried some of the warm seafood salty but was good.  Warm butter was a nice touch.  The dessert bar with its many options of ice cream, cookies, pies, and cakes.  Non really made me happy left me feeling wanting more, and not a feeling you want after a buffet.  I decided to have more fruits instead, watermelon and pineapple where great.  With the many options of a buffet in Vegas this is in the bottom of my list.  And to top it all off 2 people in my group had some type of food poisoning, I guess being picky with my food selection worked out because I felt ok.",

For the same price as the Bellagio buffet, this place is very subpar. Yes, there's a fair variety of seafood, which is probably the only good thing about this place. However, the food here lacks quality. The soup tasted bland, fish tasted funky and the cuisine selections are very limited. The prime rib and lamb chop here is so overdone (old), it looks so brown on the inside. The turkey cut was also dry. Foods are portioned on small bowls like it is being rationed. I definitely would rather spend the $45 at Bellagio or Wynn for much better taste, QUALITY, service and selection.   Definitely a thumbs down for Aria's buffet. Won't be coming back and will not be recommending this buffet.",

Had peel and eat shrimp, mussels, clams, fish, fish tacos. Nothing exciting. Sushi was Chinese buffet quality.  Chinese food section: Golden Corral quality. I was excited to try it but underwhelmed. It appeared that they had condiments for Pho out, but I could never figure out the station as I never saw any Pho or a person manning that station. Maybe just for dinner?  They had a good cheese selection and salad bar, but I don't eat salad at buffets.  Carving station had roast beef, sausage, pork belly, chicken...maybe a few other things. I tried the beef and it was good.  Indian station- no.  Mexican station- average Tex-Mex.  Tons of desserts. Nothing spectacular but not disappointing either.  Overall it was fine. I went for breakfast once before and enjoyed it much more. Average buffet but the price wasn't too high so it was just fine.",

We always had our drinks refilled, and that was awesome.  The selections aren't as wide as other buffets, but this place is about quality or quantity.  What I tried: Fish & chips in a small fry basket Grilled cod w/a lemon cream sauce Macaroni & cheese Dim Sum trio in a steam basket Green Beans Seafood Gumbo Naan Short rib w/rice and kimchee Ceviche  There were also TONS of other things (clams, gazpacho, Mexican food, Meat cut to order, Indian, Mediterranean, and more); unfortunately, I stuffed my face with mostly crab, cod and green beans.  The desserts are also awesome!  They have carrot cake, red velvet whoopie pies, 5 layer chocolate cake, cake pops, cheesecake, pecan cake, strawberry cakes, gelato, macaroons, cookies, and more!  Also, for $12.99 you can have bottomless mimosa, red & white sangria, and other alcoholic drinks.",

I'm not convinced it wasn't the same food everyday and not thrown away. We've been to the buffet several times this week because we didn't realize there is a cafe in the hotel that's better and less expensive. $101 plus tip for two people for a dinner buffet is crazy. Even if it was delicious it's still too expensive for a buffet.",

Not so boring with an ever present omelet station but there were lots of great selections of soup, Asian, Mediterranean, Tandoori, south of the border, sandwich, salad, seafood and carving station (with baked potatoes!) to name just a few.  After days of super rich food that Vegas fine dining offers, it was refreshing to have some feel good food like cabbage with stuffed veggie and taste bud awaking cuisine from tandoori grill. And the steamed crab legs were actually really sweet, succulent and not so salty (unlike in many high end Vegas buffets)!!  And it was good to see that there were some vegan, gluten free and sugar free options as well.  Some misses were -  * At check in: despite being on express lane with mLife pearl and up status, hostess seated non-express line first, twice.   * Grilled veggies looked really good but there were actually not cooked thoroughly.   I was just at the Wicked Spoon yesterday so I can make fair comparison: this buffet has better flavors than WS.  The Buffet at Aria was unexpected good eats on center strip!",

I had just visited here with my bf two weeks ago and it was by far the best visit! This was my first time going since being vegan and they had so many more choices than I ever thought there would be!! I had read a few reviews online since my last visit trying to see if it would even be worth going, thinking there wouldn't be many vegan selections. I read that some have asked for a chef to walk them through and go over the dishes and what selections they could make for you. After paying I asked our host if she could have a chef walk me through as I had some dietary restrictions, she was super sweet and said one would be by shortly. A minute later a chef walked over and introduced himself, after explaining that I was vegan Chef Craig jumped right in to all the selections that were available for me to eat, even going as far as to remake any that I wanted without the butter. There was so much food, I was so happy!! After gorging I asked Chef Craig if there was any dessert or ice creams, there weren't. But he was so fantastic to go and grab me a few scoops of sorbet from the ice cream shop outside the buffet restaurant (the sorbet made at the buffet have butter in it) the flavors happened to be mango and raspberry, my favorite. It was the best sorbet I've ever had!!! So soft and silky, full of fresh fruit flavor. My bf eats meat and had a grand ol time. Server was on top of cleanliness and attentiveness, she was such a doll, was there right whenever you needed anything. Hats off to Chef Craig and his fellow chefs!! I will continue to bring my business here.",

The prime rib and desert section was Aria's only saving grace. The gelato was housed in a revolving freezer that sort of reminded my of a Ice Cream Pistol LOL.  Avoid eating here as this is no longer a good buffet.  There is an all you can drink option for beer and wine for $12.99.  I suppose if you drink enough the food might taste better LMAO  The lobster shown in photos is availble on Fridays and I think Saturday, the price is considerably higher and you are limited to 1/2 lobster tail per person.",

So lets go blow by blow: Price: kinda expensive ($74 for 2) Waitress/server: RUDE as all hell! Now, I suppose I wouldn't have been overly concerned with her jacked up attitude if she was that way with everyone but she absolutely wasn't. The white couple next to us got the pleasant voice and got checked on frequently...we were kind of left there like the red headed step-children. I am a firm believer of tipping ones wait staff (I usually drop 20% b/c I know these people work hard and that's how I show my gratitude) but she all the way killed it as soon as she opened her mouth. She had ample time while we were eating to redeem herself but she threw herself under the bus when she was only nice to one table and not the other.  Food: literally half of what we ate was really good, the other half horrible. We made a point to try everything to get our $74 worth lol! The cheeses in the Italiano section were ok, the mozzarella kinda melted and that made it taste weird. The roast beef seemed extra bloody. There was an open faced pork bun that tasted like sea water it was so damn salty. Pesto, Mexican section, seafood soup, seafood jambalaya, sushi, salad, beef brisket, mashed potatoes, both gravy's, banana in some butter sweet syrup, Rice Krispie treats, and ice cream were on point. Everything else was over seasoned somehow including the king crab. Meringue cookies tasted gross along with the coconut macaroons and the flan was somehow bland tasting.  Manager: the manager stopped by our table and asked how everything was for us, we took that opportunity to let him know we were displeased with our server. He apologized for the experience and told us he would take this feedback and use it as a training tool. He was a very nice guy and I appreciate that he was checking up on folks and checking out the food area.  He seemed diligent about his work, I can respect that. Sure enough as soon as he leaves, our server gives us the friendly voice and asked how we were doing...yea be nice in our last 5 minutes lady, sounds like a great idea =P  Cleanliness: my spoon was dirty...turn off in my book. The table was a bit sticky as well when we were seated.  Overall: the hotel area and the casino are very beautiful and full of abstract art pieces. As for the buffet, we won't be coming back...or taking people here; just a bit expensive for the quality of the food. I just hope my pregnant ass doesn't get some kind of stomach bacteria from the mozzerella being out in room temp for a long period of time. The little seafood cups should have been on ice as well but they weren't.",

Nothing really seemed to change food wise with the exception of breakfast items taken down and replaced with crab legs and sushi. The other foods mainly stayed the same but instead were portioned into fancier presentation.   I have to admit the waiter service was good. They had a good handle on making sure our drinks were filled and our plates were promptly cleared away.   It filled the void, but did not blow me away.

    "text": "I'm the type of person that likes quantity over quality while my boyfriend prefers quality over quantity. So we jump between Carnival World Buffet at the Rio and Bacchanal at Caesar's. But then we discovered The Buffet at Aria and just like that, we found our new favorite place to eat.  We went for brunch the day after Thanksgiving so there was no line, a BIG plus. It's still a new place and it's separated enough from the casino that the cigarette smoke doesn't reach you (a bigger plus for those of us who hate the constant cloud). The restaurant is beautiful and airy with attention to the tiniest detail, even the cups they serve juice in.  FOOD FOOD FOOD. There was a good selection and most of it was pretty high quality if you avoid the \"Asia\" section. They keep their supplies fresh and well stocked and I enjoyed watching a chef make pancakes as big as car tires. My boyfriend could not get over how good the breakfast items were. I personally am not a big dessert fan but had several helpings of cake and pie. Not too sweet and just the right size to allow you to try all their selections.  The waitress we had was super nice even though she was busy and she made the effort to swing around and check up on us when she had the chance so good service too.  It was a bit on the pricey side but I would say it was well worth it.",

You have to try it!\"   The Buffet was that place for us this time around - we have no idea who recommended it, but it was recommended.  There's the usual variety - cold seafood appetizers, salad, ethnic entrees, hot carving station, and dessert.  Much like the so-modern-that-it's-boring decor, everything was just ho-hum.  The only things that wow'ed me were the creme brulee and flan.  Maybe it's just me, but I've gotten used to Vegas buffets always having one or two or ten amazing items - whether it's great prime rib, fresh fish, or oysters - gimme something to make my friends jealous with \"OMG you have to try this at The Buffet!\"   Sadly, there was none of that here - just an empty feeling inside and an empty wallet outside.",

    "text": "My friends and I looked up the best rated buffets in Vegas and found that the Aria was rated in the Top 10. However, we were a little shocked when the price was $39.95 for dinner, especially when our Wicked Spoon Buffet (in the Cosmopolitan), the night before, was $34. Shortly after being seated, we did not hesitate the price. Every person got their own lobster tail (already pre-sliced in half) and unlimited wine! The buffet was great and offered snow and king crab legs (also pre-sliced in half). They had plenty to choose from, even for me, who was on a pretty strict diet of no carbs and no sweets. We found out shortly after that the lobster and unlimited wine was only a Saturday night (or weekends, I don't remember) special. So, I definitely recommend trying to go around that time.  We did end up going to The Buffet at Aria for breakfast for $17. It wasn't bad, just not worth the $17. However, we did get to breakfast late and they started changing up the food for lunch, which meant we also got to fill up on lunch food for the price of a breakfast buffet!  BOTTOM LINE: The Buffet is worth the price during the lobster/unlimited wine night, but you can definitely find pretty decent, cheaper buffets for breakfast and/or lunch",

    "text": "Do NOT believe the 5 start reviews, or you WILL be dissapointed! This buffet is mediocre at best!  How could such an exceptional hotel like Aria have such a mediocre buffet? It just doesn't match up. I'm 50 years old, and I've probably been to over 50 buffets. I just don't understand how could anyone give this place 4 or 5 stars?  If you want details, here's what I did and did not like:  1. Crab Legs - Lots of snow crab, cold & steamed. But, no claws, and the small legs had NO flavor. They must be overboiled or old.  2. Mexican Food - Poor selection and odd choices for dishes. I love Mexican food, but found nothing here I wanted seconds on.   3. Meat Station - Prime Rib was just ok, Ham was undercooked, brisket was good, Salmon was good.  4. Sushi - If you want some vegatables or cream cheese wrapped in rice and seaweed I guess you'll be ok. If you want actual sushi with real fish and seafood, you'll have to go somewhere else.   5. Breakfast Food - Eggs, eggs, everywhere! If you just want freshly cooked eggs and omelets,  you will love it here. But then, why not just go to Dennys? Its a lot cheaper!  Oh, and the hashbrowns here are mediocre to bad.   6. Drinks - I bought the $13 drink package. If you want a mimosa with your brunch, you'll have it in a small round glass and it will taste bad.  Want Sangria? You'll have it in a small round glass and it will be mediocre. Want a glass of wine? It will be bad wine served in a small round glass. Want beer? YES get the beer!! Its brand name and on tap. But of course, it will be served in a small round glass!! For $13 though, how can you go wrong?  6. Deserts - Bland, bland, bland...  Gelato - good, good, good!! But why did you take my favorite - Pistachio and make it fat free? Just give me the good stuff!! Afterall, I'm eating at a buffet!!  7. Service - Table wait staff - Good!  Wait staff at service stations - Poor!  Overall - Not something I expected at Aria. I thought it would be much higher quality. I spent the whole time trying something else, hoping I'd find at least one item that I wanted seconds on. Other than the gelato, it didn't happen.",

It's quiet, intimate, the selection is grandiose, and everything I tried was excellent (I finished my plate every time).  My only complaint is I never got to go back for seconds because I got full too quickly.  As a bonus, I got there at 3:30 so I was able to crossover for dinner at 4pm.  That way I got to try a little bit of lunch and dinner variety (somehow, I think I prefer the lunch selection).  At $20 for lunch ($30 for dinner) it's pretty steep, but in this case you do get what you pay for.  Plus, you can always try the staying-for-dinner trick!  It's the little things that count. :D  *sigh* ...I'm lonely.",

Cold king crags legs that were overcooked. People went through them because a. Lot of them were just undesirable and people picked all over them leaving only scraps. Nothing remarkable.  Esther showed us to our table. She failed to let us in after we had walked to check out the food, only to tell us to go back to end of line, no exception. She unwilling to make better of the situation by letting us use mlife line.

It was very buttery.  Some of the other dishes tasted fine just not quite what you would expect them to taste like.  There was certainly a large selection with stations from Asian to Pizza to Indian to Diner.  The crab legs were good but when the Vegas buffets split them the taste and freshness is not quite the same.   If the food had tasted more authentic I might have given them 4 stars but for a Vegas buffet it was better than a lot of them.",

I didn't try them cold, but asked the chef to steam them instead. I was not disappointed.  Dessert selection was pretty good too.

The waiter  was attentive- dishes were cleared quickly;  and he checked on us frequently.

As with most buffet items, once you taste more than five pieces of the same item, the taste gets progressively worse.   - The best items were the fresh selection of sweet watermelon, cantaloupes, melons; and the delicious mini mint chocolate cupcakes- just perfect size and not too sweet -As with most buffet meats, the meat items (ham, sausage) were dry; however,  the BBQ chicken was quite tasty and only a tad dry. -The beef for the make-it-yourself tasty tacos was well seasoned.

    "text": "Occasion: Brunch with MCT friends   What I Had: Weekend Brunch ($41 total)   Food Review:  Was unimpressed. I am convinced that the $41 price tag is mostly due to a premium to avoid the wait. The $35 (before tax) buffet at the Wynn trumped Aria by a long shot. Their asian food was gross: the chow mein was soo salty, the dumplings were strangely chewy/rubbery on the edges, and their fried rice had too much soy sauce. The breakfast food was average. The sushi was maybe TroGro level sushi or similar to Safeway sushi. I was disappointed with their breakfast burrito as well, which was so saturated with hot sauce that I couldn't taste any of the components like egg or sausage.   I will say that the desserts here, solely in terms of taste, were for the most part just as good as the buffet at the Wynn. I had their strawberry cheesecake with white chocolate, and it was delish.   Service Review: Self serve.   Venue Review: Although there was no line whatsoever and plenty of seating (chairs and booths), the buffet had to be at least half the size (or maybe even a third or quarter the size!) of the buffet at the Wynn. They also didn't have much unique selection (e.g., the buffet at the Wynn has croquettes and other cool and normally high-value items).   Overall Impression: Unsatisfactory! Aside from the clean and classy decor in the Aria, the buffet had little to offer, especially compared to that of the top buffets on the strip, and especially at that price.",

Example: cold dry chicken,   pizza was hard, only 2 sushi items to choose, prime rib was fatty and chewy, overall the food selection was not very good IMO. Will definitely go to the Mirage buffet next time. They have a better selection and their food is better quality.",

Bottomless drink menu much more expensive than other hotels here it is $16.99 ($1.00 cheaper than wynn) (caesars $11.99) (Studio b -m resort unlimited drink included in $24.99 dinner buffet price)   2.They say they serve 2nd drink only when u are done with 1st one ( studio b you can drink all u want whenever u want)  3. You can only order drinks only for 2 hrs (Which they dont tell you when upfront when u purchase)  4. Server is pretty rude and the way they talk is very annoying and rude   Food is not yummy for they price u pay",

The ambiance of the restaurant was very open, modern, roomy, and had a great flow to it.  3. Food station was standard, but done well. Selection wasn't huge but what they did have was quality and preparation was excellent.  4. The Asian section was fabulous. I enjoyed the tiny dim sum basket with the 3 dumplings, Peking duck bao tacos was tasty,the little Korean bowl of rice Kalbi and kimchi was perfect. The sweets was my second favorite. Creme brulee was simply amazing. I've tried many, and Bellagio has always been my favorite, until now.   5. I liked that everything was quality. They absolutely didn't skimp on anything. I ordered green tea and even the tea was organic and full leaf tea in material bags. I was expecting something cheap, like everywhere else.   I highly recommend the Aria buffet. I give them a 5 out of 5 rating. For the price, you're  getting quality food. EXCELLENT!",

Your sole mission is to eat one or two thousands of dollars of snow crab legs and shrimp.  Reality check - it ain't happening.  The food here was decent, but nothing special.  I did eat as many crab legs as possible, but after the 3rd or 4th plate, it just tasted bland.  I do love how they split them in half for you.  The other food there, such as the flank steak, the portuguese sausage, spaghetti, french fries, some asian stuff, mashed potatoes, and sushi were just average.  They didn't even have soft serve... C'mon man.  Soft serve.  Who the F wants lime flavored gelato?  The Aria is on my black list for at least 2 years.  Go somewhere else for a buffet.",

Come on, beats paying double at Wynn or Bellagio!!!    or  Rio seafood buffet as their shrimp isn't as huge/peeled and their crab legs look like itsy bitsy spiders....  Aria Aria...Aria!",

The atmosphere is absolutely pleasing to looking at, but at the end the food was still just alright. Nothing stands out from service, but then again nothing went wrong either.

Prices are typical of a Vegas style buffet.  Located inside the Aria, its actually one I haven't had yet so I figured we give it a try during the vacation.  Lets talk bacon because I love me some bacon.  Actually we both loved ourselves some bacon so it was no surprised we picked up platefuls for the breakfast here.  It was golden, crispy and just perfectly seasoned.  Service was nice and the decor was pretty good too.  While the selection was nice, it wasn't as big as some of its counterparts.  Aside from the bacon, some of the other dishes were just ok.  They weren't memorable but they were pretty good regardless.  The dessert aisle had me really excited.  We took our time there but ultimately it was just ok too.  I got me a bunch of stuff and couldn't finish a lot of it but they tasted decently good.  When you've gone to so many horrible buffet places in California, this is a great spot in comparison.  Overall, its another buffet joint in Vegas.  The selection is decent, the food is good and the service is nice.  It just lacks a bit of a memorable appeal but we had ourselves a nice time just enjoying some good food and conversing.  I'm not sure I'll be back to this one.  There are better options but if you're staying at the Aria, this is a pretty good spot to grab some food.",

I had a free buffet she made me go all the way downstairs to the mlife desk to solve a problem that was never a big thing she was just being rude. I talked to the manager. I visited the buffet at Aria twice during my stay tried breakfast and lunch. The food actually tastes like real food and not like something you put in the microwave and is cold. I loved my experience here and I recommend others to give it a try and see how they like it. The selection is good I'm vegetarian plenty of options. They could and should let people get their own drinks because I like getting a variety of drinks when I'm at a buffet. But this is truly the best experience I have had at a Buffet  I took my kids they love the selection in desserts and The carving station is delicious according to my kids.",

We stared at a tower of used plates for over 15 minutes, lucky we had a bigger table. All the servers at the buffet looked so angry and like they hated working there, probably why the food tasted so bad.  Meat and seafood were super dry. I never knew you could make steamed crab leg jerky but they managed to here. Even the lamb curry was dry and its braised in liquid.   Desserts selection was good but nothing really made me want a second bite.  Only good stuff was the chicharron, korean short ribs, and the gelato.

    "text": "So let me start off most of the food was AMAZING. My husband said the fried chicken was a little dry and one batch of crab legs was a little salty.  Now why a 1 star rating. I'm in Vegas celebrating my 30th birthday I came with my husband and friends. There was a group of 9 of us there for Brunch. When we arrived we we helped quickly we had 8 of us get the 2-for-1 bottomless drinks. Our hostess sat us quickly and was very polite. Then our server Catalina was the worse possible server. When we went to get food my sister was the first one back to the table. She asked if she could start off the table all with mimosas. Catalina told her she couldn't until she checked all our ID's first off how would we buy bottomless drinks without having our IDs checked. So when the rest of us sat down she checked ONE persons ID and then just gave drinks to the rest of us so what was the point of saying that. She could have said everyone has to be sitting down to order drinks (if that's even the policy). Then once we had our first round it took her forever to bring us the rest of our drinks and forever to come around and clear our table. We had to ask the hostess three different times to send our server over.   Now if it was busy I would completely understand. There were two other tables sat in our area with only two people at each. We saw her standing around tried waving her over with no avail. Now we had a group of nine. By default my mother also told me to always leave a tip of 20% when you have a large group but take off money every time there is a service failure. We all left a 10% tip on the way in when we paid but after the crap service we got we didn't leave the other 10% cash tip. We made sure to tip the cooks though, again the food was awesome.   We probably will come back and request to not be seated in her area",

I pretty much loaded up on meat and crab legs but don't forget to grab some cheesecake for desert! I wouldn't mind coming back, I just wish it was little less expensive.",

    "text": "Pros: relatively affordable for a buffet, lots of options and ethnic food, great service  Cons: food was good but not amazing   Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night and the food was good overall but there were some misses. They have Asian dim sum, a carving station, Indian food, seafood, and a large dessert bar.   Highlight of the meal was the best naan I've ever had- crisp outside, soft inside. It had the perfect amount of garlic and salt to make your taste buds sing.   I was very disappointed by the desserts. They were beautiful and there was an amazing selection, but the taste wasn't there. The creme brulee and ice cream choices (like chai tea) somewhat redeemed it.   Overall, a solid Vegas buffet to bring your friends and family too. It's worth trying but I'd probably explore a different one next time.",

We used a MyVegas voucher for a BOGO, you have to get it from the MyVegas App, then go to MLife desk and they added it to my MLife card. I asked the cashier at The Buffet to open a ticket for me to tip our server with a credit card because we did not have cash.  About the food, they have several stations for international food, salads, desserts, etc. They had big sea food option with crab legs, Louisiana boil, sushi, ceviche etc.  Some of the stations were not open until dinner time, I believe they open them for dinner around 3:40pm.  This was a good deal, specially with the BOGO offer.  They do have a separate fast line for customers with MLife Pearl and above, or MLife Mastercard cardholders.",

    "text": "I've actually been coming here for a few years even before I finally moved to Vegas, so I've seen the minor changes they've had over the years. I think it is about time to write a review.  Parking - MGM properties rolled out their paid parking. It's annoying but I guess there's not much I can do about it. I wish they could validate for eating there or something but anyway..  Came here on a Fri night around 6:30pm, there was no line to get in but the place was only around 40-50% capacity which was actually kind of surprising - as it's usually even less than that during peak hours.   Our server was Maryann, she was wonderful to deal with. She always came by every several minutes to check on us and was very friendly.   As far as food selection/quality compared to the other resorts, this place is probably closer to a 3.5 star. The other 0.5 star they earned from me is from the good service we've consistently had.   The good-if you come fri-sun for dinner, they usually have king crab legs and oysters. Quality is generally acceptable as long as you don't come too late in the day. The meat carving section is also usually pretty good - definitely get the prime rib if you're a fan.   Worth a try-I always find myself eating the Indian food- the naan bread, tandoori chicken and the curries always find their way to my plate. Their dessert section is small compared other buffets but still acceptable. They have their famous spinning wheel of gelato/ice cream as well as little different cakes and such. I usually find myself ending the meal with a cake pop and some coffee.   The not so good-the Asian food is a joke. I'm sorry. The \"sushi\".. Is very sad looking. The fruit selection is almost non existent. The cheeses look like they've been out for too long and the pizzas are always kinda dried up.  They used to grill large shrimps and scallops in the middle but I think they pulled the plug on that.   In summary, come here for the king crab legs and oysters on the weekend if that's what you're into.  Or if you like to sample little bits of each kind of cuisine.  If it's not your thing then I suggest you go somewhere else.",

The king crab on weekends and snow crab on weekdays is a winner because it is served hot and in small batches to maintain quality. Real drawn butter accompanies the simply steamed or spicier chili flake Cajun versions of delicious crab. Naan bread was delicious in the Indian section and went well with the chicken curry. The ham and pork belly at the carving station were tender and not salty. I recommend the pork belly it's guaranteed to make you as fat as you desire. Red velvet pancakes were delicious and the Nutella was warm and flowing decadently.   Service was excellent and a shout out to Herbie our server who was on point and considerate during every stage of our meal. If you get him you are lucky.   Bring your M Life card to wait in the shorter line.  Like an idiot I forgot mine and had to wait about 25 mins. I didn't cut the line like some mofos who pretended they don't speak English but that's because I'm classy like that. Aria buffet is now on my list of good buffets. Don't tell anyone because the lines will get longer.",

The meat at the carvery was decent, but sone meat like the char boiled steak was over cook and dry. This buffet is not worth the $60 I paid, if it around $35-$40, I would give it 4 stars instead.",

I cannot believe this place charged us $75 per person! I wouldn't pay $20 for this horrible establishment. I only gave it one star because the crab was decent.

The third time, however, I waited patiently for the fresh batch of crab legs and was handsomely rewarded. Totally worth it!  Everything else was either just ok or a pass. I tried thier baked salmon (good), clams (gross), new zealand green-lipped mussels (ok), shrimp (good) and eel (eh). For dessert I had cheesecake which was ok and caramel macchiato which wasn't what I expected. I didn't like it.   Moral of the story...it's all about the crab legs. Lesson learned.",

In the pictures, they are advertised as king crab and snow crab. The crabs actually offered at the buffet were cheap, tasteless crabs that are quite frankly not good. The selection was minimal. The beef was probably one of the few good things, but even then it was served cold. The shrimp were clearly thawed, and the noodles in the noodle soup were not up to par. The sushi used cheap quality fish that I doubt was sushi grade. There was A very limited selection as well. Every thing we ate was clearly low quality. And on top of all this, They are charging 52 dollars! Go to wicked spoon or any other buffet and you'll have a better experience.",

Meanwhile other line was much faster would have gotten in sooner if we lined up there.  When we told hostess we were waiting over 1/2 hour and we would miss our show she told us we can just get a refund or wait up to 2 hours!  It was not even full. Lots of empty tables!

There were things I wanted to try such as the big meatball but when I looked at it, it just looked sad and had been sitting there forever. I just couldn't bother to try it for the sake of my own health. The mexican food station was awful, old and dry. The indian food station looked like slop and I couldn't touch that either. The \"crab and shrimp\" in the seafood station were slim pickins but, if you love muscles they have an abundance of them! I don't know why they started throwing all three of them in together. People just sit there and pick all the crab and shrimp out and leave the muscles. If you're going to be that stingy with them, then just don't bother putting them out at all. It's just not cool. One star for the desert station and gelatto. Do yourself a favor and find another buffet that isn't as expensive as the Aria buffet. ANY one will be better! Blech my stomach is getting upset just thinking about that place!",

The best time to come here is about 30mins before breakfast ends and lunch starts so you get to pay the breakfast price, but also get to partake on their delicious lunch. Also it's only 16$ to add bottomless mimosas or beer to your buffet experience and this is the cheapest compared to all the other buffets in Las Vegas, well according to my research anyway...lol  I really enjoyed the quality of food here at Aria. Everything tasted super fresh and delicious. It was easy for me to over eat here because I literally had to try everything.   The wait staff here is also super friendly and they are really on it to bring you your bottomless beverages.",

There was a line since we are not M Life members or VIPs, but the line moved at a reasonable pace.  If you do buffets, you know what it's like that first Vegas buffet - your appetite is limitless and you want to eat it all. And ate it all we did. Every. Single. Station. (Except crab legs and pho soup because we don't like those things).  There is something for everyone here. There are even delicious roasted on the grill veggies at the carving station. Chips and dip. Little mini salads. Many foods from around the world.  Like most buffets, it is not super amazing. Like the Naan bread was heavy. The dim-sum taste was mediocre at best. I wished they had a steamed pork bun and they didn't have it. The tandoori chicken was adequate.   The desert section was great. I should have saved more room for this. I wanted to try them all. I almost did but not the pink meringue which supposedly was do die for. The gelato was great and I tried 5 flavors. I wish I had some of the apple pie. Bread pudding isn't my thing so no for that.   Anyway, if this were the 2nd or 3rd buffet I ate at in Vegas, I would have given 3 stars, but since it was the first one and I was so hungry and I ate everything and my stomach had room still and felt happy and well served here - I am giving it 4 stars.   I know the reason why I am fat now is partly because it all started here.",

The buffet is very pricey just like all other buffets in 5 star hotels but not all live up to the hype such as this buffet. Although it looked very nice and chic, it didn't have large selection compared to Bellagio and Bachannel Buffet. My shrimp cocktail only came in small cups with one shrimp inside. They didn't have a a shrimp pile like most buffets just a small dessert size cup with one shrimp and some cocktail sauce. The king crab legs were very good and so was the rest of the food, I just wished they had a wider selection of food but the dessert section kinda made up for it.  They had a lot of different kinds of cakes with my favorite the key lime pie and the occasional cheesecake, gelato, fresh fruit and warm baked cookies. Restroom is located right behind the dessert section so it beats walking outside of the buffet.  The buffet is located in the 2nd level of the casino right next to the Zarkana theater, Gold Lounge, pool and the hotel elevators. Buffet overall was not bad but I had better.",

Unsuccessful because these guys were staying at Vdara, so they had the resort credit.  Fine, whatever, I'll give it a shot.  I can say...pretty good.  Not quite Wynn, but up there.  Before I get to the food, it's important to note how spacious and clean this place is.  There are those buffets that look so ghetto that you really can't feel comfortable pigging out.  This is not one of those buffets, so rest assured that's not a problem.  They space out the food by various kinds of cuisine: Chinese, seafood, meat section, sushi, etc.  Here's the important stuff: king crab legs, rack of lamb, prime rib.  As long as you have those big three, then I'm sold immediately.  Just grab a plate of king crab legs, grab some warm butter, and go to town!  They also have a BBQ beef and pork ribs too, which are a nice change-up from the big three.    Aside from that, don't waste your time on sushi.  It's just standard fare and quite unappetizing if you ask me.  The dim sum here was pretty bleh, but the roasted duck leg and Peking duck was pretty damn awesome.  Raw oysters were also ftw.  And their truffle mac and cheese...this is probably the best thing in this place for real.  I typically stay away from carbs when I come to a buffet, but for truffle anything, I'll always make the exception.  My only gripe is that the shrimp wasn't already shelled, and that's why I can't give it a 5.  Come on, I don't have the time to waste on shucking the shrimp!  Barely made it to dessert, but their cheesecake is pretty good.  They have a pretty nice assortment of desserts as well as gelato.  Of course if you actually make it to dessert, I commend you.  Also have fruits, which has a purpose that I don't really have to make further mention of.  I still wanna go back to Wynn buffet but this was pretty good.",

It was a great compromise when none of us could agree on one type of food -- I'm especially hard to please because a lot of \"celebrity chef\" restaurant options don't have vegetarian options. The buffet was reasonably priced (for Vegas) at around $24 a person with the option to add unlimited alcoholic beverages for $12.99.   There were never any waits for tables, although we went at slightly off hours, and the food was always fresh. Buffets have always scared me because people are gross and covered in germs, but everything was clean and an A health grade was displayed (s/o to my fellow germophobes). Some of the things I tried that were quite tasty:  Make your own baked potato bar Naan and tandoori vegetables mashed potatoes yams with marshmallows kale and pear salad purple cauliflower cheese blintz (A+) Brussels sprouts gelato  mac and cheese ...  I'm too embarrassed to continue this list. #gluttony",

I sampled from each genre and it was like ok to fill you up but by comparison to the real thing, completely lack luster in flavor.    The wait time was horrendous on a Thursday for lunch at 11 for almost 45 minutes and there were plenty of tables  open. It's like they held it up to avoid people getting back in on the breakfast price.  Speaking of, avoid the scrambled eggs, it seriously tasted like powder eggs (ick)!   Service- The staff however were very nice and attentive. Constantly removing plates and getting drinks refilled fast, filling up food as soon as it got close to empty.  But I would say the price is fair for what the other top tiered hotels charge by comparison. So if you want to check off that new LV Strip hotel buffet on your list of to do's...go for it / why not?

    "text": "I was in Vegas the past few days, and had the choice for a comped dinner buffet at Aria, or a lunch buffet at Bellagio. After reading reviews for both, I chose the dinner buffet at Aria, and I was not disappointed.  First, let me say this: I did not go to this buffet to eat gluttonously. Instead, I took small portions of several items (6 trips, which I will explain in a bit) so I could sample more items.  I added on the bottomless alcohol package for $12.99 and paired different drinks with different \"rounds\" of food. I will notate which drink I had. I had one beer, one Pinot Noir, and one Champagne. I also had a glass of club soda, which I used to cleanse my palate between items.  And yes, I took notes while eating dinner!  Round 1 - Stella Artois Beer ----------- * Truffle Mac & Cheese - I'd never had truffles before and I love mac & cheese. This was delicious. The sauce was light, and not overpowering, and the truffles were tasty! * Jasmine rice - This was from the Asian section. It was good - not dry at all. * Prime Rib w/ Creamy Horseradish - a bit dry for my liking. * Meatball w/ Marinara and Parmesean - I had two of these - and they were so good. The marinara sauce was a bit spicy, which was a nice and welcomed surprise. * Multigrain roll with cranberries - I thought this was a standard multigrain roll. When I bit into it, I saw there were cranberries. Bonus!   Round 2 - Stella Artois Beer  ----------- * Carnivore Pizza slice (pepperoni, sausage, bacon) - It had been sitting out for a bit, and was a bit cold. * Pineapple Sausage - This was from the Asian section - quite tasty, I liked the fact the pineapple was mixed in with the sausage. I'd never tried anything like it before. * Chicken Pot Stickers - Cold, hard, and stuck together. Very disappointed. * Vegetable Pad Thai - Good, but not a lot of spice/flavor. But good. * Beef w/ Veggies - Similar to a Mongolian beef, w/o peppers. Was a bit cold. * Provolone Cheese - Wow, these were pungent!  Round 3 - Stella Artois Beer ----------- * Beef Steamship - Like the Prime Rib, this was a bit dry. Perhaps I should have tried the au jus (in retrospect). * Lentil Orzo - Cold pasta salad - orzo, lentil, and tomatoes. Freaking delicious! * Portugese Sausage - One of my most favorite items all night - spicy, tender, and delicious.  Round 4 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City ----------- * Clams - I tried clams for the first time....and I liked them!! * Sirloin Oscar - Served with crab meat, bernaise sauce, and asparagus. This was grilled to order and was the highlight of my meal. Great char and flavor on the steak. I got mine Mid Rare+ (between MR and M). The Bernaise sauce was phenomenal. The crab was delicious as well!  Round 5 - Pinot Noir - Parducci, Mendocino City ----------- * Pork Belly - Nice crispy skin, very tender meat. * Chorizo Rope Sausage - Hello flavor explosion! Spicy and tasty! * Au Gratin Potatoes - Very good - mild flavor, not overly cheesy.  Round 6 - Prosecco Champagne - La Marca, Veneto, Italy ----------- * Red Velvet Whoopie Pie - Nice tender cake, great cream filling. Nuts on top. * Creme Brule - nice glaze, but too creamy inside for my liking. * Coconut Macaroon - Nice toasted outside. I could've eaten so many of these! * Brownie - Rich, chocolatey - it's a brownie! But seriously, this was wonderful. * Oreo Gelato - One word: divine. * Cinnamon Crunch Gelato - The show stealer of the desserts. Oh. My. Gosh.  Regarding drinks, the Pinot Noir was really good for being, what I assume, to be their house Pinot. The champagne was delicious as well. In fact, I will be looking to purchase a bottle of both the Pinot Noir, and the Champagne later this week if I can find them.  While some of the carved items were dry, I will admit I did not use Au Jus, and I can only imagine the difference that would have made. There are so many choices here: Italian, Latin, Indian, Asian, Deli, Seafood, Carvery, Desserts, and much more. I did not even remotely try everything on the buffet, nor could I, as I would not have been able to eat it all. But I will try more items the next time I go back.  Do yourself a favor, and have dinner at the Aria buffet the next time you are in Vegas. Despite some of the items being cold, the service was outstanding. This place gets a solid 4.5 stars from me.",

It's like the customers are a nuisance to servers, they were rude and very unpleasant! If you're going to work in customer service, you might try to be nicer to people. I had higher expectation from this buffet considering its reviews and location. But I'll be sticking to M Resort Buffet as the service staff there are way more pleasant!!!",

Arriving after 11am, we had to ask for waffles and cereal, as they stop serving them at 11. The staff did go to great lengths to get us what we asked for, thus deserving the 3 star review. The waitress, however, was slow and inefficient. She brought me coffee and forgot to leave a cup after it took forever to even arrive after getting our drink order. She didn't refill our glasses at all. The buffet itself is sort of a let down. The food is decent and it's limited. It served its purpose in a pinch, but we won't be returning.",

    "text": "Slow!Slow!SLOW! I am a Platinum M-life member and there is a dedicated line for M-Life guest. Tonight wecwaited almost 15 minutes in this line because the cashier was doing whatever it was that she was doing! The regular line ended up calling me over after she saw how disgruntled I was from waiting in my line. It wasn't even but 2 guest ahead of me and that's the sad part! I guess I expected more because the name ARIA holds. I've been to this buffet at least 3-4 times and I can honestly say that it's never consistent! It really just depends on the visit. Tonight I finally decided to go ahead and give my general consensus of what I think about this particular buffet. It's probably at the bottom of my top buffets and slowly moving off my top list completely!  to go to with the WYNN being at the top followed by the Cosmopolitains buffet. Here's why.. I think that for $39.99 a person the quality of meats and seafood could've been much more better. I know they can do better because I've had better here! The crab legs have two different options.. Both cold and hot.. Neither one of them were worth my time or up to par for me tonight.. The warm ones barely had any crab meat inside and the cold ones had the worse \"fishy\" taste to them which in result turned me completely off! They market these \"endless\" crab legs all over the place like they are something to write home about..more like write home and tell them how worthless they are is more like it! I headed to the meat carving station and went with the beef ribs and the center island station was preparing sirloin steaks at your request. The ribs were so dry I had to soak them in bbq sauce to save the day. The steak was Probably was the best part of my visit. I feel like there could've been more and for $86 and some change for two people I left with a bit of dissatisfaction that's for sure. Took forever for refills on drinks! And To leave an even more bitter taste in my mouth I got home to only find out that the cashier over charged me for the buffet an additional $39.99 and although yes she reversed it she could've at least told me there was an error! I had to call the next morning the find out the explanation for this charge. Manager explained she didn't see the charge but from what I explained she could only imagine that the cashier already reversed it and because it was the weekend I wouldn't see my money until Monday..smh go figure! That's the slick behavior I DONT like. Watch your credit card statements would be my advice! On the bright side we walked over to see Zarkana so if you see seeing the show this is an okay option to dine at last minute before the show..",

I especially liked the Sunday brunch buffet, great variety of breakfast items, all their pancakes are delicious, they had about 3 different kinds. Everything is so fresh and yummy. Of the desserts, the bread pudding was by far the best. Only thing I wasn't so impressed by was the service, but ultimately didn't matter too much in a buffet setting.",

    "text": "I wasn't sure if I wanted to eat at the buffet here because of the mixed reviews.  But we decided to since it was so cheap.  $14.95 for breakfast, we would have been lucky to get a breakfast that cheap at Encore!  I wasn't even able to finish my one plate but I really liked my made to order omelet with cheese, spinach, bacon, & mushrooms.  They had about three different kinds of sausages, crispy bacon, and assorted cold cut meats & cheese.  The cute little waffles weren't bad either.  I seriously cannot do buffets anymore, my tummy ain't what it used to be.  But the breakfast buffet here is alright, there's probably a better one or two on the strip, but you can't beat the price.  The hashbrown balls kind of had a funny taste to it.  Half of the fruit I sampled were sweet.  The apple crepe was just okay.  And on my way out I finally got to meet Janice C. for a few minutes as she was in line with her family.  Yay for Yelp buddies in Vegas!    The made to order omelet station and the bacon were yummy, these were the hilights of the buffet for me since I didn't eat much.  Loved the vanilla like scent lingering throughout Aria as well.  The price is right and the wait was pretty minimal.  This place wouldn't be number one on most people's lists, but in my opinion for breakfast it's not bad at all.",

Plus each person gets half and order of lobster! The lobster came out piping hot and they added a mustard dipping sauce which was good. ( I stuck with butter and lemon)  The food is pretty decent here. The quality of food is great.  They make their portions in smaller batches, which was nice. There is a cold, hot, carving, middle eastern, italian, sushi and american stations.   King crab legs were already halved for us which were more easy to eat!! nom nom nom! I must have ate 2 plate fulls of them suckers! Prime rib was really good not dry at all. Chicken curry was not spicy on bit. The fresh naan and garlic naan was AWESOME! Add a little mint julep was the perfect condiment. The desserts were good. I enjoyed the cream brulee, chocolate covered strawberries and gelato. Oh and if you are a coffee drinker, order a cup of joe. My friends claim its one of the best they have tasted.  Service was slow. We had to ask for them to clear our plates and even that they took long. Selction wise its not as grand as the one in the Rio but quality wise its super good. I can't complain. I just came for the crab legs :)",

Yes, Aria didn't have that much, but that's why they charge people $20.  My meal was good, the decor was nice, something different. I like the lighting the most. Service was good and fast.   They had Chinese food, Dim Sum, didn't try it, why would I? I can get the real stuff at home. The desserts were good. My favorite was the counter that was ice cold, to keep the desserts chilled.",

We went for dinner on a Saturday evening and were very pleasantly surprised!    GOOD (my favs): Lobster tails, prime rib, chocolate covered strawberries  BAD: Service  - I notice that none of the reviews mention the LOBSTER so i assume that's new, but that made it all worthwhile.  Without it, I'd probably agree that this buffet might not be the best bang for your buck in vegas. They also had crab legs, shrimp, and mussels.  - Prime rib was really good. They had flavored skirt steak as well along with several other meats (pork, roast beef... don't remember all)  - Took FOREVER for our server to take away the plates.  They just had ONE person waiting on our table so it would take a while for her to get around to all the tables.  They should just have anyone passing by take away the dirty plates but they only had our ONE server do it. That was our only complaint. My husband also thought the lighting was too bright (like a cafeteria) but i didn't mind it.  - True that they don't have a bunch of different pastas or \"filler\" dishes that many other buffets may have but they have the important stuff (meats & seafood) that I look for.  Bottom Line: Worth it for the Lobster & Prime rib.",

The roast chicken was good but the server was rude. The mashed potatoes were completely white and I think might have been instant. What was delicious...the pizza with home made crust, the salad bar, ham and roast chicken and the peach and berry cobbler. Also the waitress was very friendly and attentive.",

    "text": "HORRIBLE HOSTESS'  and MANAGEMENT!!!!!  I visited the Aria buffet this monday (march 21st) and I was so excited because I love the hotel and had the best service all 3 days that I stayed there! I had never been to a buffet in Las Vegas but made sure to make a point to visit one this time around. I really wish I would've gone to the buffet at the Wynn beause the reviews for it are stellar!  My girlfriends and I arrived at the buffet around 130pm for lunch the price was great about $23 and the cashier was friendly. There were maybe four people ahead of us so there was no wait and there were tons of open tables. After paying they had us wait there at the register for the Hotess to come and take us to our table. After about 10-15minutes of waiting there were about 10-15 people lined up behind us all paid and waiting on the Hostess. By this time we are asking the cashier 'what's the hold up?\" and \"why is it taking so long to be seated?\" The sweet lady (shikieko) who took our proof of payment was getting flustered because we weren't the only customers questioning the wait. Another man in line offered to go and find the Host for her because she expressed that she couldn't leave her post. After a few minutes more of complaining from all the customers waiting Shikieko ran off to find the Host who were no where in site. They came strolling out in a pair (one was named Kirly, she was especially RUDE) without any sense of urgency and still chatting to one another as they approached us. At this point a friend of mine was was pissed and requested to speak to the manager. The manager took a minute to come out as well so when she came we were all already at the buffet rushing to get food because we were on our way to the airport. Once we got to our table the manager (Brittany) was standing there. She started by saying \"Did you all want to speak with a manager?\" We replied \"yes we did we are not satisfied with the service we recieved at the front counter! The Host are not friendly and have no sense of customer service or urgency we have been waiting for nearly 15 minutes to be seated and there are several tables available\" Before I could finish she replied \"oh well they came as soon as they could they were busy clearing tables, but ill talk to them\". Before I blurted out BITCH what fuck is your problem you owe us a damn apology!!!!! My gf stepped in and said \"Tthey were no where in site and a 15 minute wait is just unacceptable when there are several free tables. It's not busy in here and they could have thanked us for waiting, apologized or something!\" Brittany replied \"oh ok well ya I will talk to them.\" We also brought in a cake with us. We had no intentions of cutting the cake there our plan was to grab a cocktail at a lounge in the Aria and cut the cake there. Brittany made sure as she walked away from the table to say \"oh by the way you all can't cut that cake in here!\" We were extremely pissed at this point.  So we conitued to eat, but the food was nothing spectactular. They had a a few dishes from several different cuisines (Italian, Mexican, Japanese, American, seafood, roast beef, and a pasta bar) Im a vegetarian so I wasn't impressed. I had a a few avacado rolls, vegetable rolls, mixed green salad, corn on the cob, french toast and tofu salad. Believe it or not the best thing was the damn french toast everything else I tried was so mediocre. So after we ate we decided to cut our cake and offer our sweet server Shikieko some she decilened; but wecontinued to nibble and left the rest there in hopes the manger would see!!!!  DON'T GO HERE THE MANAGER IS BEYOND RUDE SO WHAT CAN EXPECT FROM HER RAGEDY ASS EMPLOYEES!!!!!!  Really sad my stay at the Aria ended this way!",

Also, as a vegetarian, I had no trouble finding anything to eat! I even feel like I got my money's worth (35 something pp for dinner).   Cons:  While there were veggie options, I had to ask about a bunch of things (like soup) to find out if there was any broth or anything in it. And no one knew! Not only that, they didn't really offer to find out. I just skipped them all, but it was a little strange that they didn't know! Also, dessert was a little lame. Granted, we didn't get to dessert until they were almost closing the buffet, but there was only one kind of ice cream out (butterfinger...bleh!) and none of the plates we tried tasted worth the calories. The cobbler was good, but sort of the tail ends.   All in all, I loved it, but it would have been nice if they had more than two options for wine selections (i.e. substitute beer/champagne). Also, my fourteen year old sister cost the same as the adults drinking! That was sort of lame. I love the Aria, though, and I would be down to go back to this buffet for a different meal!",

    "text": "There's a reason why Aria's buffet is one of the only buffet's in Vegas in which you do not have to wait in line.  Like most Vegas buffets, they feature foods from many different cultures: Asian, Mexican, American, etc. The quality of the food is subpar, especially when you're paying 35 dollars for brunch. The only customized made to order items were the omelets. There was not much quality food selection for the price. The only really expensive thing were the crab legs. If you want to get your money's worth eat like 2 dozen crab legs. However, there are 2 redeeming factors. 1) the desserts. Their dessert selection was great (though Wynn's buffet is better) They also had plenty of options for people restricted to low sugar diet. They were all well plated and delicious. 2) the service. The service was great. We had drinks right away and our server always replaced our beverages before they were empty. This was very helpful since we were very dehydrated after a long night drinking.",

Seems like the strategy is to focus on quality than large selections (plus for me).   I spent my time eating crab legs, oysters, shrimp (ie. the expensive stuff).  Some of my friends got the meat (they said the prime rib was salty but other meats were good) and I tried the cake desserts and I thought they were horrible.    All in all, for the $40 range for dinner, I think it's top 3.",

You get a lobster, and all you can eat seafood, crab legs, soups, etc. It is one of the better buffets you can go to.  This review is boring - the Buffet at Aria is boring compared to what it could have been. That's all.  Bottomline: This buffet is worth it for the price (almost $40), but if the line is as long as it was for us (about 1 hour), you might as well go somewhere else.  I had the Studio B Buffet at the M Resort for lunch that day, and although this is a good buffet, this buffet doesn't compare.",

I should've taken my 30something bucks and just gone back to the spa and brought a pastry from Jean Phillipe with me. I was underwhelmed - the spread is not exciting at lunch. I guess I expected something new, special. This hotel buffet could have been in Vegas 5 years ago, and this hotel just opened last year. The saving graces for me were three things: the fried rice - that was very good and not drenched in soy sauce or greasy; the cooked to order pasta bar, which was delicious; and the dessert table which was pretty and I had two creme brulee.  I wouldn't come back here. Take a 20 minute walk over to Wicked Spoon.",

I woulda given them 5 stars if they were in the low to mid $40's and kid half price and not $57 p/p tax and tip included but, it was still worth it especially when some1 in our group had VIP status and we waited less than 15 mins and bypassed 200-300 people..",

The worst part was that the dining room was only about three quarters full and if they had filled the entire room there would only be a line about half as long.  (And you would think that they would want to run at capacity as it was a Saturday afternoon.)  Another bad thing that they did was to not even have the table set when they sat us.  So our hostess showed us to our table which had no glasses, no cutlery, nothing at all really on it.  So we decided to go check out the buffet line and even after getting our food we arrived back to find the table as we had left it.  And this was about 10mins after we had first been seated, still no way to eat our food.  So we went to an unoccupied table and took the cutlery off of there.  Well now on to the food.  This food was not spectacular at all, and you think it would be from this beautiful upscale hotel but it was just a letdown.  The crab had no taste and was just bland.  Even adding salt and butter didn't help this crab.  It tasted like they may have killed it three times over.  It is hard to even remember anything spectacular on the buffet line.  What can I say this place was passable as a buffet but for the price definitely will not be back again.",

So often, the price seems too high for the amount of food we end up eating and we don't like feeling stuffed.   After visiting the Buffet at Aria, we realized our approach was mistaken.   We paid our $29.99 per person and took the tour around a very well stocked buffet with foods of all kinds, including Salads, Meats,  Italian, Chinese, Indian, Japanese, a very well stocked Dessert bar and more. We carefully selected only small amounts of each food we sampled, which allowed us to try more foods without overeating.  What a wonderful surprise. All the foods were fresh and tasty. The prime rib was simply divine.  And the banana  foster dessert was addictive.    We ended up enjoying a wide variety of foods, did not walk out stuffed, and - the best part - ended up paying much less than most of the other restaurants we visited on this trip.

A friend of a friend suggested that, \"Duuude. the Aria brunch buffet is sick brah, for real.\" So we wrangled up all 11 of the troops and dragged our butts across the street, in the rain and cold, up and down those annoying Vegas hanging walkways...only to pay $30 for a barebones sad-ass buffet.  Ok, heads up here. These people charge an automatic 18% gratuity on parties larger than 9. Don't get hosed like we did and split your group in half. All they're going to do is push together two tables of 5! Why are we tipping them anyhow when we're doing all the footwork of bringing the food to the table? Be careful, they'll also try to con you into buying the champagne brunch...they don't tell you that the alcohol is an extra $7 charge.  Food was kind of on par with Mc. Donald's. Textures were off, proteins were crazy dry. Hash browns suck...and were chewy. And don't you dare touch that sushi! Day old sushi does not a buffet make! The only thing i thoroughly enjoyed was the lovely fluffy waffles and maple syrup.   Okay, let's be serious here, Aria: you can't slap the label \"GELATO\" on tubs of generic ice cream. Don't you dare put nuts in apple pie, either! BLASPHEMY!  I feel cheated. I feel like this should get zero stars...but it should get a Bonus star for having a gorgeous hotel to walk through to compensate for a less-than-stellar experience.",

Prime rib was decent ... though it was immediately canceled out by the second-rate lamb sharing it's carving station with.  Crab legs were decent but certainly nothing to write home about ... the rest of the selection were pretty mediocre at best.  Certainly not enough fresh fish selection the likes you would expect at say the Bellagio.  The gourmet dinner also included wine which is a nice touch ... unfortunately the only red available is a Merlot (and as you guess ... I'm not really a huge fan of the Merlot ... but I'm  not holding that against them - it's the thought that counts).  The dinner also provides for \"one Maine lobster\" per person .... however, I was not told that this \"Maine lobster\" would be a teenage lobster at best.  In fact, I'm pretty certain that this lobster had just got done asking it's parents for it's first iPod Touch before being plucked from the ocean's floor and served at my table.  Had I known in advance I would have spared his life and came back for him a year later.  The buffet did have some delightful naan bread (Aria boasts the only tandoori oven available at a Vegas buffet) ... however the curry that accompanied it was a bit pedestrian.  The lone bright spot for me was the dessert - it was certainly the highlight of the entire meal.  I feel horrible writing such a scathing review for a meal that I didn't even pay for (it was comped by the hotel ... though later returned to the casino via the craps table).  However, for the price they are charging I feel that there are certainly much better options available.  Picking this buffet is like getting two face cards in black jack only for the dealer to beat you by having 21 - you expected to win ... but in the end ... reality kicks in.",

    "text": "There's nothing so spectacular here that warrants a really great review. The food was mediocre - definitely not what I expected from such a new, and excitingly modern hotel. Crab legs were cold, and nothing really jumped out and screamed \"FRESH!\" To me. However, they do have moscato d'asti on the \"all you can drink\" additional option (for $12) - so I was able to get my money's worth out of that. I'm disappointed I paid full price for the dinner buffet. Rookie mistake. I wouldn't return.",

    "text": "SO disappointed. In Vegas last few days, wanted to do one nice buffet (without breaking the bank!). I did a lot of research on multiple sites. I was with 2 companions who are gluten free, so wanted to make sure that they had enough choices. Many Yelp (and other) reviews mentioned this buffet as one that had a lot of gf options; general consensus was that the food was good. Neither was True.    First of all, if you're going within the next couple of weeks, beware - the price is NOT what's listed on the website, dinner Mon-Thurs $36.99.  Yes, there's an asterisk that says that prices may vary during holiday weeks - maybe it was there last week and I just missed it, but I sure missed it. So it was quite a shock to hear that 3 buffets with the \"unlimited pour\" (alcohol) came to about $215. Of course we could have left, but it was after 9:30 at night, we were very hungry, and my elderly relative just could not walk any more (you have to walk through what feels like a mile of Aria to get to the buffet).  So okay, it will be our big splurge meal.  Wow, what a mistake.  There were a few items that were good, one or two that were okay, and quite a few that were not good at all. Nothing outstanding.The service was good, our server was attentive and friendly, but it didn't come close to making up for the food. - Beef (steamship) and shrimp were good - Clams (tiny manila clams) were fine, mussels were not so good. Crab legs were, well, buffet crab legs. - Salad bar wasn't huge, but was fine. Pre-made salads looked great but were mostly pretty bad. - Vegetables - tasteless - Salmon and baked chicken - dry and tasteless - Leg of lamb - grey and hard, not a great flavor - Mashed potatoes - how do you mess up mashed potatoes? By putting in WAY too much salt (and we are a group that likes salt!); they also looked dried out, like they'd been sitting there all night - Crawfish - horrible. Inedible. I spit it out.  - Desserts: meh. Nothing particularly great. Creme brulee was okay. Gelato was okay, but it's not self serve so you can't take tiny amounts of several to see what you like. - Gluten free options: My mistake perhaps, but when I hear that a place has gluten free options I don't think that means they have rice and salad. Of course those are gluten free, duh, but I expected more. There is gluten free pizza, if you ask for it; the pizza guy seemed quite taken aback by the request but made one for us. It was fine. Woo hoo. Gluten free desserts were gelato (some flavors, others had pretzels or cookies or whatever), creme brulee, and I think a chocolate mousse. That's it. We asked the lady serving gelato if any desserts were gluten free. She was clearly trying to help us but clearly English was not her first, second or any number language. Her response was \"spoons on table.\"   Oh well,  It was a fun trip anyway.",

    "text": "Given free dining credit upon check in & high recommendation from the front desk, we decided to give Aria Buffet another try since it is 're-opening' on the 2nd day. The staff that seated us promised that 'the new buffet is much better than the previous one'. However, it is still the same as before & nothing special.   The cons:  1) Food were mostly warm, very close to cold 2) Selections are still limited with 'nothing special'.  3) Not enough servers. Plates were not collected promptly compared to other buffets on the strip 4) Our silverware were cleared as we were done when we were only 1+ hour into brunch. We returned to our table with most items cleared.  5) Dessert bar were empty most of the time during brunch. I'm talking about 10-11 am when ppl started to come in.  6) Super plain Asian food selection. They were only serving fried rice, fried noodles, and some other small plates.   Not likely to come back & I'm sure most users that ate there before will feel the same. Still selections are too limited for the $$$.",

    "text": "Overpriced buffet.  We decided to go to the Aria buffet because we were staying the Vdara and there are no restaurants at the Vdara.  We went on a Friday night and got scammed on the price.  For 2 people the buffet cost over $90.  They told us it was the gourmet buffet.  Evidently gourmet means king crab legs and oysters even when the everyday buffet has snow crab legs.  Serious disappointment.  All buffets on the strip are the same; same food, same prices.  Go to Freemont Street to get a buffet at a better price.",
