Service was quick---Felix, the owner/manager was very friendly and offered samples of different fillings, like reina pepiada (a chicken salad with avocado and green peas) and tripa. Ended up getting the classics: frijoles negros con queso (black beans and cheese) and pollo machado (shredded chicken). The arepas are very good sized-- I have been to other places that give you arepas the size of dollar coins. Not here!! The arepas are 4 inches of authentic tastiness. I wish I wasn't just visiting this weekend so I could eat here all the time... In fact, I think I'll go again tomorrow.",

    "text": "Ok ok... this little shack has been seeing alot of action on yelp recently so i had to see what all the local yippers were talking about. The location is kind of en, i personally would have like to sit there and grub and people watch a little but there seemed to be more of the owners family and friends just sitting around on a Sunday afternoon taking up space then actual customers enjoying the food and relaxing in a chair. After we got the cook to actually get back into the shack and stop chit chatting with the family outside i was thinking maybe i might finally get to eat. $3.50-$4.50 was the average cost of an Arepa across the board but keep in mind when your asked if you want cheese that its an additional .50cents to your total. Ordering a chicken, beef arepa and a bean and cheese empanada. Got my food and it all fit into a medium sized styrofoam container, this was where i asked is this all of it? yup. Now ill say the stuff smelled good driving in my car trying to find a place to sit and eat. It tasted even better when i Nom Nommed on it in the 5 bites it took me to eat the entire thing. But it left me wanting something more to eat because it did not fill me up at all.   To those looking for a tasty bite/snack to hold you off before a dinner or a late night munchie after a little night life in Vegas sure this is the spot. But if your looking to be stuffed after having one $4 arepa id say only if you were a tiny 90ln chick. You need at least two of these to be a complete meal so keep that in mind when ordering. What id like to see is some better seating for the customers so i dont have to go 5 blocks down the road and park my car. And i think the use of maybe a complete meal package... like 2 arepas one chicken one beef and a little rice and beverage for lets say $10? i think this would not only have customers happy but also the owners would sell quite a few of these instead of many ordering just individual as i did when i sampled the offerings.",

(comprende?) real juice of MANGO or TAMARIND or SUGARCANE or GUAVA or GUANABANA.....they were all excellent, thirst quenchers ....and yes I tried all of this in the same visit......it is simply good.   -CLEANLINESS: Well its a little 10x20 kitchen with tables on the parking lot....I took a peak inside the kitchen from several angles and its clean, almost as if it was new, people that work around that area kept coming and going for to go orders, the parking is old but clean.   -THE RUNDOWN: Just go, eat and behold grandmas cooking! and if you never had a grandma just adopt the cooks.  simply good food.",

One arepa can be enough for a light meal, but I tend to eat two.",

I went with a few yelpers around 10 pm and I was still fearful for my life when this bum haggled us for a dollar. Thanks to Angela H. for making him go away!!!   Ok with that being said, I can now move on to the real review.  So after the CMYE 51s game, a few of us were still feeling like fatties since baseball food is gross and unfulfilling. After a list of places (Tacos El Gordo, Triple 7, this other taco stand that Anthony M. mentioned which I forgot the name of), we decided on this place. Rolled in about 10 minutes before closing. The workers were not annoyed to see us right before closing. Props to them because I would be irritated seeing people strolling in right before closing.   The arepa I ordered was delish. It reminded me of a tamale but in sandwhich form. It was packed full of meat and vegetables. Definitely more meat to vegetable ratio, but still a good thing. The bread (or masa or whatever its made of) was flaky and buttery and the meat was tender and cooked just right. Came with a bottle of cilantro mayo sauce thing and some hot sauce. Both made the arepa even more tasty. I could have easily finished mine if it weren't for the beers I drank earlier.   Definitely a good lunch spot or late night dinner spot if you are in the area. Like I said earlier, just be careful when you get out of your car.",

The staff was friendly and more than happy to make recommendations of their most popular dishes. Between me and my wife we had 3 arepas which was the perfect portion size. We had the Reina Pepiada, Pabellon and Roasted Pork Butt. The Pepiada was refreshing with its cilantro/mayo sauce. The Pabellon had a sweet/savory taste to it thanks to the plantains. The Roasted Pork Butt was full of smokey and delicious butt flavor.   We were definitely satisfied at the end of our meal and wish we had room to try more. Will have to stop by again the next time we visit Vegas to try the others.",

The arepas are delicious and surprisingly filling; I usually get the pork butt and it is juicy and flavorful. This place also serves amazing woodfired chicken that can be ordered as a 1/2 chicken combo or as a whole chicken. The combo comes with 2 sides of your choice. I usually get and would recommend the rice and fried plantains.   The owner has been featured in the Weekly and works as the head chef in the kitchen. He sometimes will come around to greet diners, but I have seen that happen less often now that the lines have gotten out of control during the lunch hours here. I'm craving some arepas now as I write this review...if you haven't been here yet, I highly recommend it!",

Warm and bright tones fill the room with orange and yellow. The staff is super helpful and knowledgeable about the menu. Restrooms are super clean and selfie worthy! Prices are amazingly affordable. The servings are extremely filling and proportionate. I'll definitely be coming here a lot more in the future. Two thumbs up for this awesome food spot (:",

This place is located off the strip, but it has a convenient parking lot and it's easy to get to. Gets decently crowded during dinner hours, but luckily there are many tables to sit at!

I was disappointed with the fillings. Let's start with the temperature. They were Kramer lawsuit hot. Hot food is good but so hot that it burns your mouth, not so good. But temperature can be solved with blowing and patience. The flavor was lacking. I am used to eating well seasoned meat and beans in Venezuelan dishes, and these were not. In addition the fried plantains were not very ripe which made them dry and starchy in the middle. I was hoping that I would like Viva Las Arepas more. Que lastima!",

The saucy chicken avocado cilantro mixture is oh so refreshing for a hot summer day. I would award the pork butt a distant second place, it was a good one to start with, I like to end with my favorite flavors :)   For the arepa newbie, just because they look small doesn't mean they aren't super filling... 2 is sufficient for a hungry person, 2.5 if you're slightly hungrier, and 3 you are willing to sacrifice stomach comfort for the experience of more flavors.

Natural Fruit Juices...Mango and Passion fruit mmmmm so yummy!  You must order a fruit juice, forget soda. Trust me!   I ordered a shredded beef empanada, my friend ordered two different types of Arepas, we both got a natural fruit juice.   We sat in my (air conditioned) car to eat as it was hot hot hot outside and this was 10pm at night, ugh. They brought us our order to the car where an awesome conversation was started with the Owner Felix.   So we chatted with Felix for a bit at the car, we informed him it was our first time trying them out. He gave us a bit of the History behind it all and how he previously worked with Mario Batali!   He said I must try something so he went and made a Reina Pepiada Arepa for me to try! He told me I am the Reina Pepiada, whatever that means, lol Wow, it was Amazing! Delicious, melted in my mouth, full of flavor!   He also wanted me to try his Cod empanada since I told him how much I love seafood. Mmmmmm yummy soooooo good, that also melted in my mouth like butta! The best way I have ever eaten cod fish in my life, in form of an empanada. Not just any Empanada but his which is the best!   He also made a beef empanada for my girl Karen to try, mmmm she loved it, the best empanada ever.   Felix...thank you for treating us so special and taking the time to hang out with us! You truly hooked us up and spoiled us so well!  We will be back sooner than you think!   Muchos Besos!",

Three friends and I split: beef tongue arepas, roasted pork butt arepas, shrimp arepas, and ham and cheese arepas. WOW, it's for sure what Misty said: HOT POCKETS BUT, WAY BETTER!!!!!! There was so much flavor in the meat. It was marinated well and dripping in juices or sauces.  Also, tried the gyobano (sp?) drink and a coconut dessert similar to an empanada. That drink tasted exactly like the fruit which is funny cuz I haven't had that fruit since I was a kid in Hawaii.  Service was cool and they had 2 for 1 arepas. It's, also, kinda fun to just eat on the streets of Vegas. Not those fancy schmancy restaurants on the strip.",

I eat these arepas on an annual basis - and it's consistently awesome, even through the transition from the tiny walk-up stand/shack to its new restaurant location (on the next block over). I had never been to the physical location before, and decided to check it out this time. My friend and I got to the restaurant at like 11:58PM and they close at midnight (oops), but Felix welcomed us warmly and insisted we eat there as opposed to getting it to-go. We both wanted the reina pepiada arepa, but they only had enough for one so he gave us an extra beef arepa and the cachapas for FREE! After I ordered I asked what a 'pastelito' was, and when our food came out, he brought out an order of the guava pastelitos...for FREE. That man is so dang NICE.  -Wood-fire beef arepa ($5): Really good meat - I like the shredded beef better, but this wood-fire technique is apparently new? Good savory flavor but I personally like the shredded texture better - less meat falls out with each bite. -Reina pepiada arepa ($5): I normally dislike mayonnaise, but this is sooo good. The chicken+cilantro+flavors+avocado are like the best chicken salad you've ever had. -Cachapas ($5): Never had this before, we loved it! thick gooey cheese between SWEET corn pancake thingies. They weren't tortillas - more like thin cornmeal pancakes, and were sweet. Sweet and sorta salty from the cheese. So. Good. -Guava and cheese pastelito ($2): Reminded me of wontons but filled with guava jam and chunks of chewy cheese. Again great flavor - sweet from the guava but savory from the dough and cheese.  Everyone working there was so nice - we definitely were the last people in the dining room, and they didn't rush us at all even though Felix told us when we left he had to be back there at 7:30 the next morning! I felt so bad but the overall experience was seriously awesome. This is for sure on my list anytime I go to Vegas.",

Cheap delicious eats!  So happy that Anne L. introduced me to this place.  Here is what we tried: 1. Reina peplada: the most popular.  Chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  Served cold.  What is not to love??? 2. Pork butt: it is delicious with cheese added!  Soft pork, sorta like a pulled pork sandwich. 3. Woodfire beef: with tomato, lettuce, and onion.  Tender beef with all the veggies. 4. Garlic shrimp: fully loaded and can be served hot or cold.  5. Fried yucca and pork rinds: this was surprisingly delicious!  I was scared about eating pork rinds but they went well with the yucca!  It's like interesting fries :)  Some other notes: - bad area but nice restaurant. - right across the street from Luv-It's Frozen Custard! - the sauces are amazing - the bread is toasted and yummy  Can't wait to come back and eat everything here.  Haha.",

It was super airy, fluffy, and had just the right amount of flavor so that it didn't detract from the filling. I had the shredded beef arepa, and I thought it was great on its own. With one of the two sauces, especially the spicy one, it just took it up another notch  *Thumbs down* Location is away north of the Strip, so not really walkable. But if you have car and you're looking for off-Strip good eats, this place should be on your list.",

The menu is very simple and the place is a little shack. The outside temperature was near 115* and you can only dine outside on stools. I felt sorry for the cook BC it was too hot eating outside  so kudos to the chef inside over a hot grill without AC!   My order -1 lengua Arepas and 1 shredded beef Arepas. I was pleasantly surprised and enjoyed the Arepas. The outside pocket tasted similar to masa around a tamale. The inside filling of beef reminded me of a stew flavor and the tongue filing was minced up and not gamy but flavorful.  The green hot sauce they give you in a bottle gives the Arepas a nice spicy kick and was yummy.   I'm a new fan of this place but next time I'll return late night instead of mid day.",

Okay, seriously though - from chatting with the guys that worked the late shift on Saturday I found out that this was a small food truck that proved its cute self to be delicious.

If you're boring and only eat chicken strips and mash potatoes and god forbid don't like flavor, then don't come here.  But for $4 you will be taken through a bold and flavorful journey.  The masa cornmeal patty has the perfect texture, crisp on the outside and nice and soft on the inside.  We had the shredded chicken based on a few locals who were parked at the bench.   The shredded beef emapanadas were pretty good but the arepas are the star of the show.  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the meats.  I look forward to coming back VERY soon to try their lengua and pork butt.    Speaking of pork butt, these arepas fit perfectly in your hands. It really is the perfect grip second to the OG across the street but c'mon....that grip will cost you multiple trips at Viva!",

    "text": "I have long avoided this place for two reasons: one, I despise the food truck trend. And two, my previous experience with arepas was limited to some mystery-meat-stuffed weirdness at a bus depot in the Venezuelan hinterlands.  But yesterday, as I was driving past the street corner where the Arepa boys do business...out of the corner of my eye I noticed that the proprietors were two hot Venezuelan dudes of childbearing age. Hell-O! I did a quick U-turn and pulled into the parking lot.   As mentioned, my previous experience with arepas left me skeptical...but the hotness of the staff, and the fact that it's not actually a food truck, but more of a dingy kiosk unadorned with Twitter and Facebook logos, convinced me to give 'em a second try. And now.......... I, too, Love Arepas!  I only had one -- the bean and cheese. But it was fantastic!! WAY better than the ones I had in Venezuela (they hate Americans down there, so they probably pissed in my arepa at that bus depot). At $3.50 it was a filling mini-meal...and actually stuck to my ribs through three cocktails, preventing me from getting wasted and doing embarrassing things down on Fremont St.  IMO this is hands down the best dining in all of Vegas -- cheap, unpretentious, delicious and al fresco. You can sit at the little tables in front of the arepa pod and enjoy the scenery of the neighborhood: a strip club, a dive bar and an all-night drugstore patronized by pimps and weirdos.   I will MOST DEFINITELY be coming here again and again and again -- and that's just with the hot proprietors. I'll come to the kiosk again, too :-)",

    "text": "If I were to die tomorrow and come back as a food it would be an Arepa. My only regret in life being that it took me so long to discover this AMAZING food. I first had this back in September, and have eaten it at least once every other week since then.  I have been a hardcore Tamale fan for years, and I Love anything that involves corn. Corn bread, corn masa, corn souffle, etc. So when I found out Arepas are these delicious little pita pockets made from corn I fell in love before I ever even tasted it. When I arrived at the Dino's parking lot I knew I was in for something special when I saw all of the picnic tables sitting around outside, and at least 10 people standing and sitting around eating and eagerly awaiting their orders....Oh yea, and this was at 11pm!  Looking at the menu, as usual, I couldn't decide which of the many amazing options to try, so, also as usual I over ordered.  I got 3 Arepas 2 empanadas, and 2 tequenos. Total cost: $16....(Although, they have raised the prices slightly since I first went and this order would now be roughly $20.) But trust me this is enough food for 2. I had no idea how much meat they were going to cram into that little corn pocket. I got the Roasted Pork butt, the Shredded Beef, and the Garlic shrimp arepas, and although I realized I had over-ordered after one empanada and half the first arepa, I still managed to polish off every bit of that order except the tequenos, which were the only thing I wasn't extremely impressed with. (They are basically like bland crescent rolls stuffed with white cheese.) But, whatever that greenish white mayo-type sauce may be, it is the most perfect condiments i've ever had and goes perfectly with the saltiness of the meal.   I haven't tried any of the more interesting ones: Tripe, lengua, etc. But i you are an obsessive tamale fan like I am just go and try the roasted pork butt, and you can thank me later.",

I'm kicking myself though for not trying the beef tongue arepa.  That's when you know a place is really authentic.  When it offers body parts that turn people off when they see them in the menu, you know you've found something good.  Next time I'll try that arepa and see how it tastes.    For now though, I greatly enjoyed it, the chicken and beef were delicious and the sauces they came with on the side were perfect!  No ketchup needed, and just the right amount of spice.  Looks like I found a new downtown lunchspot for those days when I can't stomach the nearby cafes.",

Located eerily close to the intersection of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, this stand has plenty of seating, but think about the weather because it's outside. Don't wear anything nice because the food drips.  We couldn't tell the difference taste wise between the shredded beef and the tongue arepas. Halfway through we regretfully realized the condiments provided were delicious. Don't be a fool; drench your arepa in them. A fatty may not be full from just one arepa.  We tried the agua de panela. I think it might be an acquired taste. Maybe I'll like it next time.  We came here on a sunny afternoon with no wind. Parking was a cinch and the line was small. I will return to try cold fillings and empanadas.",

It looks like a little shack across the street from the OG so based on location and looks alone it feels a little sketchy but thats actually part of the charm :-) You order the food but the servers will bring it out to you in the car. We had the chicken arepas, chicken empanadas and a cheese empanadas. Everything was really tasty :-) The sauces they give you are wonderful also. I loved the green sauce the flavor was so delish....somebody (my husband) should had warned me about how hot the red sauce was though...that stuff was HOT!! So I'm going to warn you all, try a little at first cause its HOT!",

    "text": "Oh man, I was so excited to finally get a chance to try this place!  After several failed attempts (due to hangover induced comas), I finally struggled to get to I love Arepas (which is located next to a bar near the stratosphere casino/resort) to try as many of the arepas as possible on two consecutive trips (end of Sept 2011 and Halloween 2011).    I will start with the two sauces offered.  One is a tomatillo based, spicy salsa.  The other is a crema/avocado based sauce.  Both are freaking like crack and would go delicious on a shoe.  On to the main show.  I have had a chance to fully consume or try bites of the following (and remember, I am a fat ass at heart and am not ashamed):   1. Shredded Beef 2. Shredded Chicken 3. Beef Tongue 5. Roasted Pork Butt 7. Riena Pepiada 8. Garlic Shrimp  This place is legit and you really can't go wrong with anything on the menu, but my hands down favorites were the #1 Shredded Beef and the #7 Riena Pepiada (especially this one, it is addictively good).  In all honesty, if you are staying anywhere near the Las Vegas strip, order a cab and pay the $10 to get here and eat the delicious ass food.  One more note:  don't be fooled by the size of the arepas; they are really filling.  You can easily eat one, but two may make you explode.  I recommend coming with a group of 4-6, ordering a bunch of different arepas, and trying things family style.",

The corn cake like outside was crispy and they stuff it with your choice of meat, lettuce, tomato, onion,  and cheese and avocado are extra.  The empanada was made of the same corn dough, the chicken on the inside was good.  The taqueno was the corn dough wrapped around a stick of mozzarella and then fried.    Everything was very good.

Something about the thick bread and soupy toppings just doesn't work for me.   The arepas are quite large and filling. One per person is more than enough. We decided to order 5 between the 3 of us to try different flavors which was way too much food. Too much food was wasted. I would have appreciated the man who took our order to let us know one per person would be enough. He even asked us if we had been before and we told him no. This location is in a sketchy part of town, so just be aware of that.  The only thing I really enjoyed was the passion fruit juice. But it was juice. Super sweet and sugary I'm not going to go crazy over juice. Long story short, if you like arepas, you would most likely enjoy this place. I did not.",

By the end it was falling apart due to all the juices, but delectable nonetheless :) Although it didn't look that large, it was filling and had more meat than expected! On the other hand, it was a little on the heavier side for food.  I got the pork butt arepa (forgot to add cheese), and also a shredded beef empanada. Both were great.  Reasonable prices, ample seating, and delicious food will have me adding it to my list of go-to spots while in Vegas.",

The pricing is very reasonable and the atmosphere is cheerful! It was our first time trying any type of Venezuelan food and Viva Las Arepas did not disappoint! The service was quick and friendly. The food was fresh, tasty, and hot as well. The only thing that was just \"okay\" was the fried plantains, I have had this dish before elsewhere and I do not believe their plantains were ripe enough yet for cooking. In all, I would recommend this to anyone in Vegas that'd like to try out Arepas!",

I took 5 high school seniors out to eat here so they could experience some of the food that they will be eating as they about to serve their LDS missions to South America,  At best their knowledge of foreign food was eating Roberto's and Panda Express.  We had a little of everything.  They loved it all and so will you.  The empanadas are about the best I ever had.  Perfect crust around enough filling.  Arepas are my new favorite sandwich pick the meat you like and go for it. Start with whatever they suggest as the favorites. You have to use both the spicy dark green and the light green sauces. Try the Tequeno Pastelitos (fried pastry covered cheese sticks) awesome.  Yucca fries are uniquely good but if you are not adventurous the regular french fries are great.  For something traditional, I like the sweet fried plantains but the boys like the \"tostones\" which are the stage 1 (green) plantains that are fried up and smashed like a thick potato chip.  The juices are a little expensive for my taste but I am a huge fans of fresh passion fruit juice.",

We enjoyed the chicharrones with fried yuca, since they were tasty and not overly dry. They made a really nice side dish. Now the arepas. I was initially afraid that they might be small for the price ($5-$6), but they were fairly large and packed with meat. The arepa dough itself was perfect: crispy on the outside and moist/mushy underneath. The garlic shrimp arepa was delicious and I like how they served it cold. It held a good number of plump shrimp and tons of great garlic flavor.      While the shrimp was good, the best thing I ate was the wood fired chicken arepa. The chicken was amazingly good. Very tender and wonderful smoky flavor. The wood fired beef was delicious as well, as it too was tender and smoky. I was quite impressed when I saw employees wheeling in wooden logs through the back to the smoker. You wouldn't expect a restaurant like this to have a smoker dedicated to smoking the meat, but Viva Las Arepas does, and this becomes clearly evident when you taste the meat.     Overall, this instantly became one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas, and I'd love to come back. The food is cheap and delicious.",

    "text": "I'm a bit torn in writing this review.   I've had Viva Las Arepas (VLA) bookmarked for the better part of two years now, hell maybe more and it wasn't until recently had I been able to finally stop in.   I love that there are still highly rated,  non-boojie, cheap, no frills food near the strip. I love even more that it's Venezuelan food.  Unfortunately, I may have been driven by the hype so much that I was left slightly disappointed.   After a very long, grueling work schedule, my beau (bless his tired heart) was sweet enough to bring me here because I listed it on my top 3 places to eat while in Vegas.  We drove up to VLA, which isn't a stand anymore, they've transitioned to a brick & mortar. The parking lot is shared with other establishments and can get crowded during peak hours.   The menu is large enough to spell some confusion for those salivating tastebuds. I know these arepas can be filling so I definitely had to strategize my meal. The man just got himself a carne arepa (non shredded) and 3 shredded beef empanadas. I got the pork buttt and carne arepas in addition to a chicken empanada.   Our plates came out hot and fresh within a few minutes and those empanadas were super hot--so hot that a piece of it was left thrown and regurgitated back onto our tray lol (wasn't by me though). We enjoyed both empanadas though I will say the shredded beef was better than the chicken. We also both agreed they needed more meat in them.   I love the arepa itself, and they generously filled 'em with our protein of choice. Unfortunately, neither of us were impressed with their beef. It was tough and lacked flavor. Even with all that drippy sauce, there was just something amiss with the beef.   The pork butt I did enjoy. It was moist and tasty, and once I was carb loaded, I picked out all the pork and gobbled it all up.   As cheap a meal as I thought it would be, we still paid $30++.   Overall, I'm saddened this long sought bookmark didn't wow me, but I wouldn't mind giving it another try.",

They don't offer the same items!  I was talking to my sister about this, a place hooks you on certain items for a great price, blows up in popularity and then and goes and changes everything that made you love them in the first place, while upping the price.  I've been eating here for 3 years. I'm the one who gave the business owner a \"You've been Yelped card\" to claim their business page and I think they make a good product. What I hate is that they don't offer lengua or tripe anymore. Those two items are the only reason I ate here and it's the only reason I keep coming back - on the maybe misguided hope that they've brought those two dishes back.  Alas, I've been relegated to chicken or beef, which I'm none too impressed with. I can get chicken and beef anywhere. I can make them at home (which I've done - if you buy Maseca, you can make arepas.) Lengua and tripe aren't things I know how to cook for 1 person.   I've had their other dishes which are okay, and they have really great sauces, but I don't feel the need to keep coming back as they don't offer what I like anymore.",

As I mentioned I wanted to come here to 3 other people who frequent or lives near Las Vegas, they said, \"ooohh it's on THAT part of town.\"  We ordered 4-5 different items and a couple of desserts.   Everyone liked the corn cachapa.  I was okay with it.  I did try it when it wasn't hot anymore.  And it's one of those food items you want while hot and the cheese is empty.    I had the asada arepa.  It was good. I think the texture of the arepa is very thick and maybe fried.  So after half an arepa, I was pretty much done.   I didn't think one would fill me up, but it did. After finishing my meal,  It definitely felt \"heavy\" from the fried, oily part.   Reina arepa was good too.  Tasty sauce.  Guava and cheese pastry and the coconut one was not good.  The pastry was not flakey like I'm used to.  I generally love Cuban's guava and cheese pastries and thought this would be a bit similar.    Location: apparently the scary side of town.   Service: okay, nothing special.  None of us had ever had arepas but we felt rushed from the man taking our order as if he expected us to know exactly what we want.   We sat outside and they brought out our food to us.    I would like to give arepas another try.  Maybe here, maybe somewhere else.",

Glad to see that they offer more than just Arepas now, and are open 24 hours on weekends.  Perusing the menu, a couple of things caught my attention-Pabellon, and Cachapa. Too bad they didn't have the two combined, because I've been searching for that killer combination after having it at Pica Pica Maize Kitchen in Napa. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/pica-pica-napa-2?select=D2QDnqVaFYS7EpRd-4XTqQ#Eo2CTtCtgsNwu0ZAaFIeiQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/pica...</a>  Having already tried a few of the Arepas, we ordered both the Cachapa and Pabellon to share as well as their tasty Soursop Drink. These were both pretty good, but I wished they would offer more ways to have the cachapa than just cheese.fillings, or even a pabellon cachapa? (hint, hint!) maybe like any of the arepas  The Arepas are okay, but I just am not much of a fan of that masa pocket that holds all the fillings together, kinda like a Mexican Gordita which I'm also not really a fan of.  If worse comes to worse, I might even just order a cachapa and ask them to add the meat and plantains inside and charge me extra...that is, if and when a craving hits, because we're almost always next door anyway!

Parking is a little challenge since it's located in a small complex. If you cannot find parking, there are spots to park around the area and you'd have to take a quick walk to get across the street. Hey, at least it's free parking!  Once you enter, you are welcomed by the smell of the meats cooking on the grill! If you  had never had an arepa, it is basically an open-faced pupusa or a falafel. You have two pieces of dough, usually made out of maize, and fillings of meats and sauces sandwiched in the middle! It is a very popular South American dish typically in Venezuela and Colombia.   My orders:  Yucca Root- Delicious and so simple! You get a lot of Yucca root cut up like thick fries (a lot healthier) and they fry it. There wasn't a lot of oil and no condiments because the  root itself has its unique flavor! This is a great side dish to order while you eat your arepas.  Fried Plantains- I love anything with bananas/plantains! This sweet dish really compliments the savory and saltiness of the yucca root and the arepas. It is a great combination to have with your meal!   Fire-grilled beef arepa- I thought the arepas were going to be small, but it turned out to be quite fulfilling! The beef is perfectly grilled with vegetables and special sauces.  Fire-grilled chicken arepa- The chicken has to be my favorite. I love the taste of grilled chicken with the arepa! I would definitely get it again!   Passion fruit juice- They have an array of drinks and juices that are local favorites if you were to be in South America! I tried the passion fruit and it was so refreshing! Not too sweet and not too watery either!  Overall, my experience here was great. Customer service was great, the food was great and so was the ambience! I will definitely be back!",

    "text": "First let me say yummy! If you don't know what arepas are, don't be afraid to try them. This place has some really great food.  I tried the chicken and one with black beans, pork, plantains and cheese. They are about the size of a street taco but 4x as filling. They look like an empanada but they are fluffier. I can't forget to mention the sauces! They give you 3 bottles of sauces for the arepas and they are the perfect topping for these. My favorite was the avocado/cilantro/ranch sauce. I bought 2 and ate half of each and was pretty full. The prices are super reasonable 4-7$ per arepa. The restaurant was pretty big and seemed pretty busy even at the early lunch hour I was there. If you're in the downtown area and want to try something new, different and delicious, I highly recommend giving this place a visit, you won't be disappointed.",

Seeing that it's far removed in all directions from the \"action,\" and the fact that I have never had an arepa before would have made it next to impossible for me to find it or even want to go there. Props to my buddy for carting us around and opening my eyes to something new and incredibly awesome. Thank, Drew-fus.  The place is clean, there are pictures lining the wall, the menus are in both Spanish and English, (great sign), and ordering is a simple as strolling up to the counter and taking a chance - something tells me that it's hard to go wrong here. I ordered the hot garlic shrimp arepa and the grilled chicken empenada. If you have never had an arepa, I really don't know how to describe it. I guess it's like a crumbly corn bun with your choice of filling piled up in the middle. Does that sound right or even make sense? Who cares, they're delicious! So great in fact that I've now tracked down a few places in SD serving arepas that I can only hope compare to what VLA is serving up in Sin City. Oh yeah, the empenada gets some love too. The grilled chicken that they loaded up in that bad boy with a drizzle of their house sauces made for a perfect and timely hangover cure.",

This is one time that I wish I had gone with my gut and not ordered what the yelpers recommended.  I ordered the Reina Pepiada (an arepa with chicken, avocado, mayo, peas) and the pork butt arepa.  Pork butt was fantastic, totally would get this again.  Not fatty, totally tender.  The Reina Pepiada though, I'm not so sure about.  I'm not too crazy about staying in shape, but I feel like anyone who is concerned about their health wouldn't be eating this for dinner every day.  I'm glad I tried it, but I don't think I will order it from this point on.  Way too much mayo for my taste.  Overall great experience, come here for a quick bite.

I had never eaten Venezuelan so I wasn't sure what to expect but I had the yucca and chicharron which is common in Nicaragua and a calchapa, this reminded me of a sweet corn tamale but with lots of cheese in it.  My husband had a pabellon, kind of looks like a Mexican gordita and had beef, black beans, and platano in it.  All in all, everything was amazing, we ended with a coconut and cheese pastelito!

Empanadas are pretty much hard to mess up on because all you do is deep fry it. It's the worst empanadas I've ever had in my life.  Lot of times, yelp ratings are reliable and very useful but this is the first time where yelp has disappointed me.  It's in a dangerous neighborhood also.

Honestly, I'd never had an arepa or knew what one was but the pictures and descriptions were awesome.  It's all corn-based so no gluten.  We ended up with Pollo and Garlic Shrimp arepas supplemented with an order of plantanos.  I tried the Guanabana drink and man that was great.  You can also get an order of just plain arepas which I did to munch on for a very lite meal.   Recommended.",

I had the arepa with avacado on it and the plantains and he had the pork arepa. All of it was perfect. I usually don't eat bread, but made an exception after reading reviews of this place and I'm glad that I did. The cornbread rolls they make the sandwiches with are so delicious. The ingredients tasted so fresh and the service was super friendly; now my husband mentions this place every date night.",

Surprisingly, the place is quite popular, despite being in that area.   I'm not sure why they would run out of warm shrimps but the cashier told me... \"Is it ok. We don't have any warm shrimps left?\" I guess their arepas are premade or something.  Anyways, my order came with two spicy green sauce (not sure what it's called) and two cucumber sauces. The arepa, contrary to what I assumed, especially with the price, was quite small. It had a good amount of shrimp filling (but it was the smaller kind of shrimps). It was, however, really tasty. I just don't really understand why they couldn't make my food warm.   Anyhow... I'm giving it three stars because I think it was too expensive. The arepa was $7 and it wasn't filling at all.",

As soon as I walked in I could smell the woods smoking all those delicious meats, I was like a kid in a candy store! I wanted to try everything but I definitely didn't know where to start. Thank goodness for all the tasty looking pictures on the walls. The staff was very helpful and super patient with me. I've never had Venezuela food before, I can't wait to try more!   For my first visit, I figured it would be best to pick a column and work my way down so I went for the #1 Wood Fired Beef, my niece got the #8 Garlic Shrimp, and my Sister got a #12 Cachapa. They were all amazing! The cilantro mayo and the hot sauce mixed are killer. I also tried the soursop drink and it was so good, it tasted like strawberry, watermelon, kiwi, and passion fruit had a delicious baby juice in my cup.  I can't wait to go back and add more to this amazing experience. For now, I'm heading next door to the Art of Flavors for dessert.",

I LOVE carne asada....I try it everywhere I go and I make it myself! So naturally what do I order???  A carne asada arepa! Now I wasn't too familiar with what arepa exactly is going into the restaurant, I had seen the pictures, meat stuffed in a bun looking thing! Well I was half right it's meat stuffed into a circle of masa. Think the filling of a tamale! I do not like masa! I only eat the meat from a tamal and pretty much did the same here....it's not their fault I dislike masa so that's not why they only got 3 stars. The carne asada had a funny flavor to it. I can't put my finger on it but it was, well funny. I was given 3 sauces and was never explained what the heck they were. The creamy white-ish one was delish so I covered my funny tasting meat with it and went on my way.   I took one star for the odd location and one star for the funny meat. I may go back to hit up the chicken.",

The arepas that this joint makes will have lots of electrolytes because they are overloaded with salt; and it looks like the heavy salt hand was not a one time incident as other fellow Yelpers also mention the non phenomenon.  Arepa was extra doughy on the inside and not in a good way. Cooking a proper arepa takes a very long time, 15-20 minutes. I prefer my arepas to be fully cooked, through and through.   Bummed that these Arepas were inedible. The smokey flavor of the mesquite wood on the meat was awesome and I could still taste the subtleties of the smoke flavor behind the heavy mask of the salt.   Possibly excellent food is ruined by sloppy execution",

They are Colombian, and there's not too many places that serve them, but I use hers as a comparison point to all other empanadas I eat.  Viva Las Arepas is Venezuelian style and has several different kind of empanadas.  The most similar to what I am used to is the shredded beef kind.  The masa is deep fried and crispy, unlike the baked Argentinian kind that is easily found in OC.  (Although they do have the baked kind as well, beef and rice, but it's a square shaped instead of the the half moon shape).  The taste is great, the beef soft, but there isn't too much filling in there.  The beef and rice ones have a lot more filling.  As for the arepas, again, I am used to the Colombian kind, where it's served on the side, plain, as a bread with your meal.  At this place, the arepas are used as bread to a sandwich with fillings inside.  We got the pork with tomato, beef, shrimp, and chicken.  they were all good to be honest.  I think I like the pork/tomato and chicken the best.  You have two sauces to go with them too.  I have no idea what they are, but the light green on isn't spicy, and goes great with the shrimp and chicken.  The red one is spicy and goes great with the pork and beef.  You really only need one arepa with one empanada and you are full.  We got 6 arepas and 8 empanadas, and the total came to almost $50! o.O Yikes!  The chef/owner asked us how many were eating with us, and I was kind of embarrassed to say it was just us two.  He gave us some deep fried cheese sticks on the house since we told him we were just ordering a bunch of stuff to try.  Those were good too.  Oh FYI he no longer serves lengua or tripe. :(",

I had the fried plantains, tostones, empanada and an arepa. Everything was delicious. The smoked meat is very tasty. With the sides, I was filled with one arepa and one empanada. Two or three empanadas could be enough to satisfy anyone. They are about twice as big as an Argentinian empanada, which tend to be a little smaller. Restrooms were clean, and there was parking both in front of the building and on the street behind the restaurant.",

Best one I had there. Cachapa is pretty big. We didn't think it was that big but it filled out the whole plate.  It was good. The Guava and Cheese Pastelitos was ok. Nothing special. Their flan was good. Similar to Mexican flan.   Definitely check this place out if you're in Vegas! Make sure to add the green sauces to every bite! It's delicious!",

Back then I'm pretty sure it was just a food truck or atleast they had a food truck cuz I remember I got it from one.  In anycase I am thrilled to return 6 years later to find they are not only still up and running but thriving!  There was literally a steady line the entire time we waited. From door to counter.  And this was 11:30 on a random Tuesday! We got the pernil arepa and added avocado. Perfection isn't even a good enuf word frankly!  Seriously if you aren't eating here you are missing out BIG TIME!!!",

They have outdoor seatings as well but the area at night creeps me out a little bit, LOL!  The food is very unique, and it's important to point out I learned that this restaurant is gluten free. I love the simplicity of ingredients focused on quality.   Imo, the meat is special because they are cooked with a traditional grill using wood which is a layer of flavor that is very distinct.  I ordered some take out: Asada Arepas, Empanada with beans & cheese and for deserts-Guava and cheese Pastelito.  Each arepa on the menu is only around $5-7 depending on what's inside it. You can add extra toppings like cheese, avocado, fried egg for .50 - $1.00.   The sauces were also excellent, not too salty, watery or too thick.  The lady at the cashier was very friendly and gave me suggestions on what to order.  Very reasonably priced, will be back when I am in the area.",

Their tequenos are golden crispy on the outside and soft dough on the inside, and you can tell they use either imported cheese from Venezuela, and if is not, then it's a cheese that resembles it very well... YUM!  When it comes to the Arepas, it gets even better. Made with authentic corn mix \"Harina Pan\", they're soft, warm and very filling. Great for breakfast, lunch or dinner! My favorite one is the shredded beef Arepa; I like adding cheese and avocado to it.  If you want to drink something typical from Venezuela, I definitely recommend having your arepa with a whole sugar cane & lime juice; it tastes kind of like a very sweet and sour lemonade.  Muchas gracias a todo el staff! Hasta la proxima... -Paella Girl-",

Now they have grown into two fast casual locations with plenty of seating.   This location is definitely not walkable but a short lyft can do. Friendly staff and they have pictures of organized menu on the walls for you to see before ordering. Both of these were favorite items the #1 Asada/Beef Arepa and #13 Cachapas (sweet corn quesadilla).   Since it's a open kitchen the indoor temperature does get pretty hot but they have some A/C and ceiling fans that help. I would definitely visit again maybe just on a cooler evening.",

We tried: Carne Assad Arepa Shredded Beef Arepa Chicken Reina Pepiada Arepa Shredded Beef Arepa Taqueno Pastelito Beef Empanada Chicken Empanada Cheese Empenada  I have to say- they were all really good. My favorite Arepa was the carne asada (add cheese and guacamole). The Taqueno is like the perfect cheese crossaint. All the Empanadas were good, not the overly fried type.  The prices are so fair. Arepas are around $6 and empanadas about $3. I eat a lot so an Arepa and an empanada or Taqueno will fill me up just right.  What really makes this place good however, are the Arepas. They have a fluffy, crispy, doughy feel to them and taste amazing.   5 stars are not given out too often, but this place deserves it.",

    "text": "I've never had Venezuelan food before this so I don't have anything to compare this to but was the food good at Viva Las Arepas? Heck yeah. My boyfriend's been telling me about this place for a long time but I've always kind of been like... are they tacos? Why don't we just get tacos? Wrong.   I ordered the #7 (chicken and avocado) and #13 (corn and cheese) and my boyfriend got the #1 (wood fired chicken) and #2 (wood fired beef) along with fried plantains and the cane sugar drink. The drink was an interesting flavor.. sweet but sour/bitter as well. The plantains were bite sized and syrupy, probably could have skipped on those. The real winners are their arepas (duh). I really enjoyed the chicken avocado. It had shredded chicken and a creamy avocado mayo sauce that didn't make the arepa soggy. The maize.. buns? Are similar to a tamale but harder. After eating the chicken avocado I figured my boyfriend's wood fired chicken would be boring and dry but the flavor was amazing, having been cooked with mesquite wood. This was probably my favorite. The beef was similar but I felt the chicken soaked up the flavor of the wood better. The surprise dish was the cheese and corn (my boyfriend's favorite. We thought it was going to be cheese and corn in the arepa but it was actually more of a corn pancake with cheese. I wish I knew what kind of cheese, it was fairly mild and reminded me of feta in texture. This is a huge portion so I recommend sharing.   Overall I was delighted to be introduced to Venezuelan food and arepas and I'm already looking forward to bringing others here to share the love! Location isn't awesome but it's part of the charm. You can walk to Luv Its custard after to get some dessert or head to Dino's for some karaoke :).",

I tried going to the bathroom, coughing, gagging, whatever I could think of to get whatever it was out of my throat. It felt like metal or pieces of bone, but the cook told me the meat wasn't even cut from close to a bone when it was prepared. They ended up refunding me the $8 I paid for my food and gave me a water bottle. Otherwise no one seemed too concerned about there being something in the food. I doubt that they even discarded the batch or did anything else about the issue.  I definitely won't be returning and my throat still hurt for another 2 days.",

Surprisingly the arrepas were good, I ordered a wood fire beef with avocado it was packed with lightly seasoned beef and priced very well for only $5. I also ordered a 1/4 fired wood chicken with a side. The fire cooked chicken was ok, it lacked flavor unless you douse it with one of the chili sauce they give you.   When your in line you better know what you want since the line moves fast and people will be standing behind you. I definitely want to go back again to try some of the other arrepas.   Only drawback it's free refills on fountain drinks but you have to ask the counter person to get a refill since it's behind the counter. Plenty of tables inside to eat.   Parking is a hit and miss since it's a small plaza with limited amount of parking.",

I have been going to this place every single time when visiting Vegas since then. Most times it's been multiple visits here during every Vegas trip! Location is right between the new strip and the old strip - nearby the Stratosphere from what I can remember.  Other than the arepas, I've tried their empanadas, pastelitos, french fries, and their yucca root. All of them have been really good but nothing will top their arepas! I've had arepas at Bay Area music festivals but never like the ones they make here. Before this place, I've only had plain arepas. Never did I know that these babies can be served in a sandwich pocket-like form.  I'm a pescatarian so I could only speak for the non red meat items. Their chachapa (corn and cheese arepas) are on a sweeter side - definitely pretty tasty but it's pretty greasy to what I'm used to ordering here. When I'm here I usually order two arepas - both flavors differ each other. They are more than happy to custom your order.  The two sauces they offer with these arepas are also pretty good! I remember one is of a creamy consistency and the other one is just green sauce. I love their green sauce! It's got a bit a kick of spice to it.  My meat eater friends seem to love it as well. Not too sure on what they get but all of it looks delicious.   Service is great, the staff is very friendly and welcoming. The place itself is pretty spacious - tons of room to sit. The parking lot is a bit small.  I've been almost 4 months since I've last been here (the longest I've been without it :( ) and I'm suuuuuuuper missing this place.   I wish their hours went beyond midnight. There were too many times after a night out in Vegas when I wish I had arepas. They do delivery as well! Haven't tried that yet though.",

Before my husband gave it to me, he said \"Do you want the good news or the bad news?\" Not a nice opener. He followed it up with the owner saying the menu was changed. I was so looking forward to getting my chicken arepa yesterday for lunch while watching my game on tv. Well, the chicken was totally different- I get grossed out when I am pulling out pieces of cartilege, then I finally took off the chicken and just ate the corn part. My husband's beef arepa was super salty, good flavor, but dang the saltiness was really high. He likes salt but he didn't finish it, so I threw it out (I can't eat that).   On top of all this, the prices got higher. Such a disappointment. I don't know if anyone else feels the same.",

    "text": "The BF and I were close and needed some snackies.   We ordered a pork arepa, 2 bean and cheese empanada and mango to drink.   The mango drink was really good. It was not too sweet, fresh and refreshing. I coulda had a few of those since it was a hot day.   When our order came it was the wrong order. We got one meat arepa and a bean and cheese arepa so we figured maybe she didn't hear the empanada part and perhaps got us a arepa instead? Oh well, we'll eat it anyways.   The bean and cheese was yummy with flavorful beans. The meat turned out to be beef (unless my taste buds are wonky) but it was so tender and fantastic. Normally shredded beef is somewhat stringy, but not this. I normally wouldn't order beef but here I would definitely consider it. The arepa was wonderfully crispy on the outside and had some chewiness inside that was addictive. I can eat those alone even. Don't skimp on the mustardy hot sauce and the creamy sauce as both make the arepas even better, I think!   Eventually I guess they realized it wasn't that they got our order wrong, we got someone elses order! The guy on the grill (I'm assuming is the owner) was apologetic about it and gave us 2 bean and cheese empanadas anyways which was cool of him. It was not what I expected at all. I was thinking more like pastry dough type empanadas, but the consistency was like the breading that is around corn dogs which lead the BF and I trying to figure out how they make it. These were tasty but since I'm a Hot Dog On the Stick fan, I'm definitely ordering just a plain cheese one next time.   Now that its hot, it's gonna suck to come visit but I definitely enjoyed that meal and want to come back again soon.",

Being that it was my first time here, Ivan helped me and offered to let me taste the meat without me asking. I was sold! The beef was so tender and full of flavor. Instead of waiting for our food to be ready, we headed next door to Art of Flavors for some yummy gelato. When we got back, our order was ready. We literally devoured that sandwich in the parking lot and was left wanting more, so I decided to go back and get another one hahaha. So here I am again. I'm glad we finally tried this place out. If everything else on their menu is as good as that sandwich and service then unarguably this establishment deserves 5 stars. I guess my only complaint is that, it's kinda messy to eat the arepas especially if you're on the go. Can't wait to come back sooner rather than later!",

I had been here in the past, so I'm very well acquainted with the reina pipiada  arepa (stuffed with chicken salad avocado mix) which is one of my favorites, chicharron arepa, and steak arepa.. All favorites. I wanted something different, so I opted for the smoked pork ribs with a side of rice and beans and a cachapa. Oh lord.. Here it goes!  Smoked pork ribs- so tender it fell off the bones. The flavor was robust and a touch smokey, but not overwhelming. Just plain delicious. Black beans- almost tasted like chili beans... I ate them all. Rice- was yummy and like that it's mixed with corn and peas. Cachapa- I can eat these all day everyday. It's a sweet and savory corn pancake stuffed with ooey gooey mozzarella cheese. This dish alone will ruin any plans of obtaining that coveted 6pack. Stay away for it is HIGHLY addictive.   I fell in love with the food, but most importantly, with the friendly staff. They were also quite perceptive because as our server was ready to deliver the food, he noticed the table was wobbly, so he immediately bent down to adjust it. He came by a few times to check on us and made sure we were completely satisfied. I sure was.   Viva las arepas is a no brainer, and I will most certainly return until I have conquered every dish they have. Thank god pool season is over.",

    "text": "I wish this place was closer to the strip. I would eat every meal of the weekend here if I could. It is definitely a must try if you are visiting Vegas especially since food gets so pricey on the strip with all these chef restaurants and what not. If you are looking for some messy but delectable eats, this is your stop.  I ordered the garlic shrimp and the shredded beef with cheese. I wouldn't get the garlic shrimp again because it didn't have enough flavor for me, even though it was still a great choice, I also needed to add alot of their green sauce and I felt like it wasn't worth it if I had to douse it in sauce. The shredded beef on the other hand... whole 'nother experience. The rich and succulent flavor of the beef paired with the perfect amount of cheese, a dab of their green sauce, and their hearty corn flour exterior... man oh man you are missing out if you haven't had this. The juice/oil from the meat was leaking from the arepa but I really wasn't mad because I just kept licking my hands (#shameless). Since it is made from corn flour it tends to be heavier and therefore I got filled faster so just a heads up that it might be excessive if you want two, unless you can handle that life then all power to you!   So glad I stopped by and can't wait to re-visit and try new arepas. Great service and ample seating, although I am sure it gets packed I was there at a fairly dull time (9:30PM). Must eat when in Vegas!",

Thats why when i discovered Viva Las Arepas, i was excited.  I will admit that it can be overwhelming walking into a restaurant with a different culture than your own.  I was unfamiliar with many of the ingredients, however, the staff was very helpful.  I ordered the shrimp and my sister order the pork.  The texture of the bun was unlike anything i had tried in the past.  It somewhat resembled an english muffin, but the sides were griddled so they were super crispy, and the inside was supple.  I got mine spicy, and got it topped with avocado, just incase the heat was too overbearing.  The whole package was just wonderful.  Now anyone would fear eating something and then noticing a mystery ingredient suddenly appear, which happened to me.  After closer observation, there were two bonus chunks of lobster, which i will welcome anytime.   Overall, i loved my lunch, it was flavourful, authentic, and very inexpensive.",

I also had the #3 Shredded Beef which was mixed with bell peppers, onion and tomato. The #3 was my least favorite of the two. My first thought of this when I bit into it was that the meat tasted exactly like the meat you would get from Taco Bell. That is not a good sign. Now, I normally like Taco Bell as fast food if a real Mexican place isn't close to me. However, when you think of a Latino cuisine and you get Taco Bell as your first thought, there are issues.

When I came it was just a food hut on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming, but now I hear it's actually branched out and opened as a restaurant just a walk away from it. I guess it has turned into a hot dog stand now.   Anyway, you can get both cold and hot arepas. They are decently priced, ranging from $2 - $5 so obviously you can't just have one! But before you go all crazy and order everything off the menu, let me tell you they can be quite filling! I would suggest two of them and an empanada constituting a full meal. I've tried the Roasted Pork Butt with tomato slices - FANTASTIC, beef tongue arepa - FANTASTIC times 2, and the Reina Pepiada which is chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise, and cilantro - not as good as the beef arepas, but still tasty. I have also tried their empanadas. Really really good. Make sure to try the arepas with the special sauces they have for you to use.   This place overall is the best place to go before a night out downtown for a quick, inexpensive, and absolutely delicious meal.",

    "text": "A regular haunt of Friday-nite Aruba Swings patrons a few doors down, Viva Las Arepas fueled dancers needs for good food and energy. Having been both to their old shack location, and their now storefront location, their arepas are wonderfully delicious and filling. The guy at the counter always laughed at (with) me when I ordered since I can't pronounce it right, but I get the veggie arepa and the cold arepa with chicken and avocado. The wait isn't long, and they make it when you order it. Better than fast food! Try their mango and passionfruit drinks too!",

The portion if the arepas may be deceiving though. They come small but they pack a heavy punch. 1 will fill you, 2 Will stuff you.   I must suggest the plantains! They were cooked perfectly with just the right amount if sweetness.   One con would be the parking. I would suggest parking in the back of the building if you are not alone.",

This is my usual because there is something satisfying about a cold and flavorful filling with a warm corn flatbread straight from the griddle.  Imagine a chicken salad but creamy and rich with avocado and well-seasoned chicken.  Shredded Beef - Yum! The beef was flavorful and extremely tender.  Not one tough strand of beef =D  Cachapa - Enjoyed this, however I wish they used a different cheese other than mozzarella.  The sweetness of the corn is SO ADDICTING!  OVERALL:  Great spot down the strip if you aren't looking to spend $$$$ for a great and super filling meal.  Like I always say, YOU WON'T KNOW UNLESS YOU TRY IT FOR YOURSELF!",

    "text": "\"I Love Arepas\" is not only the name of this food stand, it is also what you will be saying after you eat here!  Their specialty, of course, are the Venezualn corn cakes, or arepas. They are served warm and freshly cooked. I ordered a chicken (hot) and shrimp (cold) arepa along with a beef empenada. My favorite was the shrimp. The cold filling and the warm arepa made for a great combo. The shrimp was in a garlic, parsley sauce that was not too rich and very garlicky! It was delicious. The chicken, I was not so crazy about. I am not sure if it was deliberate or not, but there was a sourness to it that made it unappetizing. The beef in the empenada was only okay. It was a seasoned ground beef. I thought it would be more of a pulled or chopped beef.  The star throughout the meal was the corn cake: warm, nice texture, not too oily was great. Prices were decent, with the shrimp being the most expensive of my dishes at $5.   The location is a little sketchy and a little difficult to get to with all the one way streets everywhere, but definitely worth the effort.  Be aware, the stand is closed on Sundays!",

    "text": "This was my first taste of Venezuelan street food. I'm happy I have it a try. This joint is located right next to Stratosphere so it's easy to find. And great that they opened an actual restaurant versus just operating out of a food truck. The gentleman behind the counter were all smiles and willing to recommend an arepa for first-timers.   I had the pork butt arepa with cheese, chicken empanadas and fried plantains and passion fruit juice. This came to approximately $15. Not bad for the meal.  I didn't expect the arepa to be so heavy. Imagine an English-muffin like sandwich stuffed to the brim with your meat of choice and cheese. The bread is made of corn flour.  It wasn't bad, but adding their homemade sauces gives it full flavor. The empanada dough was thicker than I'd like but the meat again had a lot of flavor. The plantains were simple. Fried bananas. But it's blandness helped cut the richness of the arepa and empanada.  I admit I couldn't finish the whole thing and I felt as if a boulder was in my stomach when leaving. But Viva Las Arepas was an experience and I urge you to try it. Authenticity is served here.",

    "text": "Second return trip and now at their new location across the street from their former food stand!  This time I met one of the owners, Felix and I  ordered the same shredded beef arepas and this time a Polar (Venezuelan) soda.  Great looking location and still wondering why it is not packed in here. This is truly Las Vegas' hidden gem.   Venezuelan food is one of my favorite cuisines and something that is lacking in Los Angeles -- or I just don't know where to get great arepas other than at Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills. I've had Columbian arepas nearby my place, and it just didn't hit the spot.  My aunt ordered the Venezuelan empanadas this time, but were lacking flavor and bland.  Everything else about the empanada was great and wished the filling had more flavor. This empanada was unlike the many varieties I've tasted -- Filipino, Argentine, Bolvian (all each very unique).   My aunt tried the new wood fired beef arepa and she said that was also very bland -- hopefully they'll kick up the flavors in the empanadas and wood fired beef arepa.   Until then, this five-star review is for...  ... the shredded beef arepas!  This is just how I remember having it in Venezuela, along with the ham and cheese arepas I would have at the airports in Venezuela for breakfast.  Definitely go eat here while in Las Vegas and order the arepa de pabellon (shredded beef)!    Total comfort food here... we even brought a bunch of arepas back home to LA to share with the family.",

I ordered some arepas, empanadas, and other goodies to sample with the office and took them back with me.  I loved the coating on the techenos (cheese sticks) and the empanadas.  The Arepas were overstuffed and packed with flavor.  Not a complaint but be aware the Arepas (corn pita) sometimes breaks apart and crumbles so dont try to eat in your car or on the run unless you are wearing something that can get dirty.  Also be aware that the menu on the website is not the same as when you get there so don't plan your order by number and call it in.  Mysty is right, the mango drink is superb and not to sweet.  The staff is friendly and Felix talks to everyone.  When it is busy, it isn't fast so be aware. It took me about 20 minutes to get my order.  I love me some Arepas",

    "text": "I heard a lot about this place but didn't get to try it until recently. They used to serve food from a little small stand on the side of the road but they have now moved into a brick and mortar restaurant on the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas Blvd.  The restaurant itself is nice and clean, but the location is easy to miss if you go there for the first time. By the time you see the restaurant, you probably will need to make a roundabout just to be able to get into the parking lot.  Anyway, I've only tried three things at this place: rib eye steak, pork butt arepas, and asada arepas. I know that it's strange that I go to an arapas place and ordered steak, but they had a special rib eye steak for $10.99 and I was craving for it (LOL). Even though the meat wasn't high quality, the fire grilling and seasoning brought out great flavor from the meat and their side dishes were delicious.   For the pork butt arepas, the meat was too salty for my taste. Also the corn shells/buns were too oily. The asada meat was alright also.   So what's my verdict? If you haven't tried arepas and want something different, I think you should come by and give it a try. For me, it wasn't bad but at the same time it wasn't that good for me to come back on a regular basis. I will probably stop by the next time I'm in the mood for steak during lunch or want to try something different.",

My family and my Compadre Edgar's Familia are always looking for some good eats. I thought this place deserved some major props!!! The place is located in a very busy corner but once u enter the doors the service was spectacular and the lady behind the counter was very patient and willing to explain everything on the menu. Gracias Senora! My queen ordered a Reina Pepiada Arepa for herself, a Pabellon Arepa for myself & half a pollo for my handsome boys, and guess what we finished all our food and also my compadres' food the plantains he ordered were so sweet and good. Once u taste there sauce u cannot stop I found myself pouring it onto my palm and licking it off! YES!!! I considered drinking it straight from the bottle. We are from Califas and the next time we visit Vegas we will definitely eat here again. So why 4 stars I am a very picky eater as my primo Xavi says. I was still wanting more wish the Arepas were slightly bigger and my Pabellon was slightly salty but very tasty! Finalmente, Viva Las Arepas. Hasta Luego!",

Located on an unseemly street corner (Believe it was LVB/just pass Charleston - be sure to be on the look out!)  sits a tiny little 10x12 shack of goodness!  This past Vegas trip was all about exploring the local food scene outside of the main strip, and boy did we experience some delicious treats such as these Arepas!  Since it was simply a tasting... our part of 4 decided to share on one arepa... Reina Pepidas!  Yes... 4 sharing one......  Reina Pepidas is this arepa (corn meal bun toasted with savory fillings) that is filled with shredded chicken mixed with cilantro, avocado, green peas, and mayo..... just think of it as a chicken salad sandwich on steroids!  Super delicious!!!!!  The flavor of the cilantro and avocado coupled with slightly crispy buns of the corn meal made this a super filling yet delicious treat before actual lunch!    Sauces comes with it too... I believe one of them is a delicious non-spicy cilantro sauce while another one is a spicy salsa that could potential knock your socks off!  Mixing all the flavors together will create a different yet awesome flavor that you surely don't want to miss.  Our party was looking at the pork butt arepa but since we were heading over for actual lunch, we decided to give it a try next time...  Is there a next time?  Hell ya!  They've done pretty well to a point that we noticed that an actual storefront is in the works just closely down the street... I bet it's going to be crowded when that completed...  But in the mean time, be sure to keep your eyes open for the little tiny shack that is on a street corner.... don't judge the book by it's covers.... you will be pretty amazed on what you find here at Viva Las Arepas!  Until next time Arepas!!!",

Both my friend and I ordered an arepa de reina pepiada, a sort of chicken salad filling, with avocado mayo dressing and a meat empenada, since two arepas would've have been too much food. I also ordered a mango water, which was very refreshing and not too sweet. Both the arepa and the empanada were very tasty.  The foos in itself is merits a four star review, and although I am hsistant, I am giving them three stars becaus eboth my friend and I felt ill afterwards. I know a lot goes into getting sick from food, veryone's digestive system if different. With that said, I can eat anywhere and I've never gotten sick.  My friend seems to think it was the salsa they gave us on the side, she says it seemed a bit off, more vinegar-y than it should be.   Regardless, as I said the food was really good so I am definitely planning on coming back and letting the management know about the sauce. I am sure it was just a fluke.",

Never coming back again. For the people that travels and want to go to a good Venezuelan restauran, check Mil Jugos in Santa Ana, California. This place in vegas not worth the trip. Bu the way, the good reviews are probably from people that haven't even tried real Venezuelan food.",

We went with the carne mechada and the reina pepiada. Both were filled to the brim with meat and other delicious fillings.

I've brought colleagues and friends here, and have had a 10 for 10 success in happy faces after the meal. The guava and cheese pastries I get every time to share, and everyone loves those, too.

It was a short walk; but also in the blistering heat,so by the time we got there I was a bit of a cranky pants. Arepas couldn't be customized since the ingredients were already pre-mixed so I was ready to write-off getting one all together, but the man working the counter patiently led my onion-abhoring self to a couple options that did not include them. I went for the ground beef & cheese (not super exciting sounding) and my man the ham & cheese one. We also ordered beef & cheese and guava &cheese pepiadas, as well as a sugarcane and a passion fruit drink.   The drinks were delicious and ~ice~ cold -- making the hot yet quick stroll back to the stratosphere bearable, and dare I say even enjoyable? Once we got inside we dug into our food -- everything was awesome! The arepas were overflowing with filling, I would have preferred shredded beef to ground...but since Im a picky bitch I was at least happy with what I had. The pepiadas were amazing, so much so I didn't really want to share. All the sauces that come with  are tasty and add great extra flavor and kick as well.  I was super happy with this meal. It was cheap, fast, and tasty. Honestly -- I found a lot of food in Las Vegas mediocre, but Viva La Arepas was the first honest to goodness great meal I had while visiting the city. I would totally make it a point to come back if I am ever in town again.",

I found out about this place about a month before I moved out of Vegas and my one regret is not trying this place sooner. It's in a sketchy area, but it is SO GOOD. Everything is perfect. Every time I go home, I have to make a stop here and get way too many items and eat until I feel sick.  Sometimes, it can be a bit salty, but the arepa itself is pretty bland, so it's a good balance. Their yucca fries are heavenly, and so are their fried plantains. The wood-fire chicken is so smokey and tender, the pork was nice and juicy, the avocado sauce is perfectly creamy, ugh. So good. They give you two sauces; one's a spicier one and the other is a creamy cilantro I believe. I like to mix them and drown my arepas in them.   If you decide to go here, which I highly recommend and will be extremely envious about, be ready to waddle out the door. If you're anything like me, it'll be nearly impossible to choose one arepa to try and you'll end up getting 2 and an empanada (which is also delicious) and yucca fries. If you are able to have room for dessert afterwards (which I highly doubt), go next door to Art of Flavors. Another hidden gem that I'm obsessed with.",

I dug around a bit and came across Las Arepas.  The menu sounded great, the prices were great and the reviews were great.  With four cackling women in my car as I head north on Las Vegas Blvd I just about missed my opportunity to make an illegal u-turn into the correct parking lot.  The main sign is between a classic dive bar and a pizza joint.  Yelp indicated they were open on Sunday but the door was locked.  We walked around and then at the very last minute noticed the adjunct small structure right on the corner.  Almost like a stationary roach-coach.  As other people reviewed, the food was really great and the two young guys were super friendly.  Will post some photos later.  I would highly recommend.",

Just one note - the arepas are very small (about the size of a slider), so if you are hungry definitely get at least 4.   This restaurant was the only redeeming thing about my stay at the Stratosphere and being this far up the strip. Eat here, it is worth it.

Here I am thinking that I was in Vegas and due to my limited financial situation, I would have to suffer the indignities of some sub-par dining experience.  But after a quick \"Gluten Free\" search on YELP - Yeah, I am actually Gluten intolerant, a curse of course - I saw the lovely link to VLA.  These folks are actually open till Midnight!  Oh, and the Arepas were so good I went back - with my craving family the next day for lunch.    What I can recommend:  Pork Butt Arepa, Reina Arepa, Garlic Shrimp Arepa, The MOST TENDER RIBS I have has since I made mine last week, Chicharonnes and Yucca - if you love pork, you gotta try this and finally the Cachapas - it is like combining some amazing farm cheeses, romano and my mom's cornbread recipe into  the most amazing CHEESY-CORN experience.    Great location - under the shadow of the Stratosphere, as you leave the New and begin your journey back into the OLD LV you can get some amazing grub for the ride.  The owner is the nicest guy as well, welcoming and sharing with his knowledge of the food and the story of the place - you must ask him where they began.    Oh and finally don't forget to get the Soursop juice.  Although its a little too sweet for most, it is a taste that lingers between a mix of mango, coconut and milk.  Gotta try it.",

Each sandwich is also gluten free. What really stood out was how incredible and fresh everything was. It was as if someone 's grandma had worked her magic to make everything so perfect. Each sandwich, or Arepo's cost $5. The shredded beef empanada was $3 and the dough was so fresh. The beef was moist and delicious. I had a hard time sharing. They also had a really interesting drink menu with passion fruit , coconut water, and soursop. If you are in Vegas , this place cannot be missed. Great for lunch!",

Womp womp womp.   I told you it was going to be dumb.   Went on Saturday 11-7-15 around 8pm to grab a quick bite.  $10.57 got me a chicken arepa with black beans and a beef empanada.  This is actually my second time here and I really like arepas.  Being from the south and eating lots of hominy and grits, an arepa is kind of like if you made a hamburger bun out of really thick, fine-ground grits and then stuffed it with lettuce, cheese, chicken, etc.  They are really tasty.  I think next time I'll just get the beans and cheese kind because their chicken is sooooo salty.",

After snagging the last parking space in the strip mall, we walked in and checked out the large menu board. My husband asked me, which menu do we order off of?  I told him 'The Spanish one if you can read it'....he let out a sigh of relief when I pointed out the menu board in English on the left.  We got the chef special arepas, he got the wood fired shredded beef and I got the shredded chicken with avocado. These things are big, one will stuff you, and I got a side of rice and black beans and plantains -oink!  Those arepas are the bomb, chicken is shredded tender and smok-d-lish, is that a word?  Mesquite grilled and so good, corn meal pita or whatever it's called is fresh and chewy, holds all that filling. Two salsas, a creamy green garlic aioli and a fresh green salsa, both are habit forming. Plantains were sweet and tender black beans and rice so plentiful, we couldn't finish. Place got the lunch crowd going out the door.  Great place.",

All Arepas are gluten-free, which is surprisingly non-existent at the major hotels on the strip.  My wife and I tried several of the Arepas plus coffee and a traditional lime and sugarcane drink.   Our favorites were the Reina Pepiada, which is chicken mixed with avocado, mayo and cilantro as well as Cachapa, which is corn and cheese. I tried an empanda as well, which was good but not on the same plane as the arepas. Each arepa is very big with generous amounts of filling.   They are made to order so you know it's fresh.  The gentleman who took our order (I think he was the owner) was very friendly and even gave us a few things for free because we ordered so many arepas (we have a hard time choosing)  Wish they had a location in Denver so I could eat there more often.   Definitely go and try when in Sin City.",

It's located north of the strip in what looks like sketchier area with   Arepa is like a sandwich, but the meat is sandwiched between 2 flatbreads made of maize dough. The corn bun was crispy on the edges and much softer in the center.  Arepas: 1) Reina Pepiada consists of chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. I was expecting the chicken breast to be dry, but it was actually the opposite.  2) Wood Fire Beef: This was fantastic! I added on avocado, cheese, and egg, which made it even better. The small pieces of juicy, tender beef were so yummy.  The empanadas were also pretty good, but the winner is definitely the arepas.  Drinks: Mango - Thick, sweet drink that was really mangoey.  Service: They got my order wrong and gave me pulled pork instead. They apologized and gave me an extra empanada for the inconvenience. SCORE!",

It's really that simple, not much to say just go try it! Oh and def try the guava and cheese pastelito",

    "text": "I never heard of arepas until I watched a youtube video where the guy talked about comfort foods he ate growing up in Venezuela. When my friend suggested this spot for a casual lunch, we decided it wasn't too far from our hotel and made the trek over.   It is a very casual spot with plenty of outdoor and indoor seating. They have a pretty extensive menu but I think most people come for the arepas. I wasn't very hungry and only ordered one - the Reina Pepiada (which is shredded chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro) but my friend ordered yuca fries to share with the group so I was plenty satisfied. They have these bottles of sauce (I think cilantro?) that you can add to your food. YUM! One friend was a vegetarian and got the corn & cheese - looked really good as well.   The arepas were fresh and delicious. It definitely was the ultimate comfort food...be careful because a few too many and you will be in a food coma hahah! At $5-6 a pop (and even more if you do add-ons) it's not super cheap but they are filling so unless you are starving, you will only need a few to be full. I'm sure these are expensive compared to Venezuela but it saves me a plane ticket!  I definitely suggest walking in a group or take a bus/Lyft as the surrounding area seemed a bit sketchy. If you are staying on the strip, it's probably not even walkable. We stayed on the outskirts of the strip and sitll walked about 20min or so. It's probably fine but I always say safety in numbers (especially in an unfamiliar area).   Side note: I noticed they have Venezuelan sodas which I would be intrigued to try on a future visit.",

Being a Latino family, we were intrigued by the familiar ingredients and stopped by for breakfast. May I say I have had Colombian arepas but trying these Venezuelan ones, there were absolutely amazing! I had the Wood Fire Beef Arepa and added avocado & sour cream for an additional charge (just 0.99) with a Frescolita soda in which the taste is sort of similar to Cola Champan (Salvadorean beverage). The environment has such a homey and welcoming feel, and the service is espectacular with attentive employees. Very clean and professional and highly recommend everyone tries this small hidden gem at the end of The Strip!",

If you haven't had arepas before, you should try this. Even if you had, it's prerry good. The basic idea is it's a sandwich with meat, but with corn dough.   There are several meats so pick which looks good. Also there's parking at the back.   To be honest I would go here over tacos el gordo nearby because I don't have to wait a lot.   Can't beat the price and value for money.",

The filling on the carne Asada arepa was just ok, not seasoned enough for my taste. We also had the empanadas which were ok as well.  The shell was crispy and not oily which was nice   Also had the chicharron con yucca. The pork was seasoned nicely, however I was expecting the pork skin to be crunchy and crispy which is typical of chicharron.  All I can say is that you should definitely give it a try to see how you like them, it's a nice change of pace from the same ol taco your always eating.",

    "text": "Arepa heaven! If there were two words to describe Viva Las Arepas those would be it. I don't think I've tried Venezuelan food before, so arepas were a wonderful introduction to it  I tried 3 of their arepas, #1 wood fired beef with added avocado and cheese, #7 chicken reina pepiada, as well as their #13 cachapas. All 3 were unique: - The wood fired beef is so flavorful from the mesquite they use; very smoky but otherwise it lacks in seasoning, namely salt. Make sure you add avocado and cheese if you get this as it adds to the flavor profile. Also don't be shy with the sauce/salsa they provide- the green salsa offers much needed heat while the creamy sauce cools you back down - The reina pepiada arepa was absolutely stuffed with chicken! All tossed in a creamy cilantro mayo. I enjoyed it although I found it a bit bland as well. Nothing some of that bomb salsa couldn't fix though! - The cachapa was my favorite. Crisp exterior sweet corn dough filled with cheese. The greasier cousin of the quesadilla and the perfect drunk food given its greasy goodness. I dumped more of the salsa on this and am pretty sure I've committed a culinary crime... but hey if it tastes good right hahaha  I also ordered the fried plantains and added some cream which I recommend. They come in a shareable size and make a great side to accompany the arepas  This restaurant was empty when we came in on a late Friday night, which was a little weird to me given its popularity. But it turns out we were just early customers despite the late hour! The tables were filled by the time we finished dining  I'll give this place a solid 4 out of 5 stars. Great service despite it being counter ordering, food comes out fairly quick and steaming hot, wide menu with lots of options, amazing salsa, great location although can be a bit sketchy at night due to the area. Knocked off a star for lack of flavor in some aspects of the food and steep prices. It really adds up if you order several things to try! For reference my order was almost $32 with tip",

Our order included Wood Fired Beef, Ham & Cheese, Cachapa, Wood Fire Shredded Chicken, Shredded Beef, Cheese, Reina Pepiada, and Vegetarian.  Everything was ready for pick up as scheduled with many small individual containers of the two sauces, a creamy avocado and a spicy green sauce.  (I kept a few for future lunches to spice up my chicken and salads!  YUM!)  They carried everything to my car without me even asking.  I love their customer service.  Back at training, everyone was happy with the arepas - vegetarians and meat lovers alike.  They said that the Cachapa was like a delicious sweet corn dessert. I hope that I have converted some new followers to this awesome family business.",

I shared 3 arepas with a friend- carne asada, chicken asada, and the cold chicken salad.  There are menus in English and Spanish, and in English the asadas are called wood fire.  I ordered these three because they were identified on the menu with a small icon, which meant they were chef recommended.  There was a short wait because this is not fast food where meals are prepared ahead of time and placed under a heat lamp.  They appear to be made to order and you can taste the difference.  The cost of the arepas were $5.00 to $5.50 and cheese ($.50) and avocado ($.99) are extra.  I liked the beef the best.   What struck me was the size of the arepas.  They were larger than I thought and one was enough to satisfy me for lunch.  I had 1.5 arepas and was stuffed.  The breading used is gluten free and is not chewy.  I would describe it more similar to the crunchy outside of a buttermilk biscuit.    The cons were a very small parking lot and it isn't in a very safe area (right across from the Olympic Garden).  But overall I recommend this place and I'll be back to try the empenadas, which I was told were home made.",

We shared all, the chicken and beef had a hint of a smoky flavor. Loved the plantains and cilantro mayo on the beef Arepa. The arepa dough that the sandwhich is in was perfect texture and nice and warm. Had a nutty corn taste. The chicken arepa was also very good combination with avocado.  As for the Empanadas they were perfect temperature and flavor.  Wonderful customer service hope to be back soon!",

    "text": "What a transformation! The humble little arepa shack on the corner has grown up into a bright, clean cafe with a great menu of Venezuelan specialties. Besides the usual arepas and empanadas, they now offer wood grilled chicken and other meats. The selling point? $8.49 for half a chicken (or serving of another meat) plus two sides! Considering the location on Las Vegas Blvd, expect this place to fill up quickly at lunchtime, attracting workers from downtown and tourists in search of a deal. You'll pay about the same for four small tacos de adobada over at El Gordo.  The chicken is marinated in secret Venezuelan seasonings and grilled over wood and charcoal. My husband gave this pollo al carbon a big thumbs up. On my visit, the smoke from the grilling process overwhelmed the room, but the owner reassured me that this issue was being resolved immediately. Order at the counter, take your number, and wait for the food to be brought to your table, or to-go is a great option if smoke is present. For $19.99, the parrillada mixta serves two people a nice variety of grilled meats. Pork ribs and Pabellon (the official shredded beef dish of Venezuela) also stood out on the menu. Sides include rice with veggies, black beans, salad, chicken soup, and plenty of fried carbs. My favorite is the tender and crisp yuca, though I also enjoyed the patacones (smashed, fried plaintains) that look like bananas rolled over by a car tire-- in a good way! The french fries were pale and soggy, so something went wrong with those. Unfortunately, the mixed salad had a strange flavor that made me quit after a few bites. It seemed fresh, so I'm guessing the lettuce absorbed some of the smoke coming off the grills. I don't really eat any smoked foods, and I won't be adding smoked salad to my diet anytime soon. Venezuelans cook some of the best black beans (caraotas, in their country), and at Viva Las Arepas, white cheese is crumbled over the top. These caraotas with a side of sweet fried plaintains or yuca fries, a cheese empanada, and passion fruit juice to drink make up my ideal comida! The creamy green sauce and creamy red sauce (salsa Golf) are essential. I rarely pass up a pastelito (guava or coconut) for dessert.  Admittedly, I grew up eating these foods in Florida at various Colombian and Cuban joints, and some of the side offerings at Viva don't quite match the flavors I crave from home. They are already doing a very good job, and if they tweak the recipes a bit and clear out the smoke inhalation risk, I won't be able to stay away from this place. Family friendly (high chairs and a changing table), salsa Golf, occasional reggaeton (spare us the bachata, please!), and very cheap eats. Chevere!",

I usually don't like corn based stuff like corn tortillas, but these are the exception.  I always get the pork butt with cheese. It is a little salty but very tasty.  The light green sauce will balance out the saltiness though.  I am obsessed with that sauce by the way.  I believe it is cilantro based? I have yet to try the other kinds they offer.  On to the place... the place is located in a dingy area of Las Vegas.  Parking can be tricky as it is limited and awkward.  It is located in a triangular intersection off of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd.  However, once inside, the place is pleasant and clean and the employees are very friendly.  It seemed like they just upgraded their menu displays to flat screens.  I like how they have it in Spanish and English.  Anyways, I would say get your butt over there and try the pork butt!!!!

They also had a squeeze bottle with a tomatillo and jalapeno sauce in it that added some kick to it which I loved. Food was very good and so was the service. Spoke with the owner for a while and he let me try some juices and my wife try the #7 meat before we bought as she is not a fan of mayo but she really dug it.  This place is also open late and is priced pretty reasonably. the portions are perfectly sized and around 3.50 each and IMO a good deal.   This is a great little spot and I will be back for sure...anyone complaining or hatin on this place is prob a whiny fu*^%n bi&*h and used to eatin taco bell and should prob head back there. If you want to try some new food and support a non chain type place hit it up..you will at least be glad you tried it.  Yelp on Yelpers",

The empanadas were amazing even though it was weird for me to eat them fried and for lunch.   We also ordered the cheese & bean arepas and it was amazing. Imagine a pancake of sweet corn with cheese and beans in the middle then another sweet corn pancake on top. It was amazing.   Anyone visiting Las Vegas should come here. You won't be disappointed.

I also like there chicharron and fritas, but not all will like if you are unfamiliar. Oh I also like there fried plantains, done right!",

Put the green sauce which is the spicy one!  Yummy sauce.  Arepa itself was grilled and tasty.    Colita soda - Venezuelan soda smelled and tasted like bubblegum - skip it.

The reina pepiada seemed to be a very popular and the menu had other chef recommendations. There is an outside patio which is really refreshing for those who enjoy the outdoor seating. Inside there are lots of pictures and the dining area has plenty of space. Was not so packed during the time of entry but then customers started coming right after. Cashier was very nice and took the order immediately. Food did not take very long to come out and appeared to be fresh. We ordered pineapple juice(good), #1 carne Asada arepa, #7, reina pepiada, #12 pabellon arepa and a plantein appetizer with cream. Honestly it was all delicious! 8.5 stars for tasting and 9 for the overall experience. Would come back to try different options if I come back to Vegas!",

I accidentally stumbled upon this place on a random Sunday after work when the original noodle joint we were going to was closed. Prior to this, I can't say I've ever tried an arepa, but from that day on, I was hooked.   An arepa is a grilled, round, cornmeal patty, which is then stuffed with your choice of meat or filling. The most popular is the reina pepiada, which is filled with grilled chicken, avocado, mayo, and cilantro. It's pretty much a Venezuelan chicken salad sandwich. I also tried the wood fire beef with lettuce, tomatoes, onions, and cheese. You can't go wrong with your choices, but my favorite is the reina pepiada for the avocado and cilantro. Also, try the spicy salsa verde with everything! I'm less of a fan of the white sauce.  Although the serving size is perfect, for only $5, you'll be salivating for more. I also always get a side of the fried yucca root, which I prefer over french fries. If you're craving something sweet, the fried plantains are nice too.   Everything is so tasty here that I can forgive the fact that they charge 50 cents for a cup of water. Viva Las Arepas!",

I seriously thought I was on a hidden camera prank show. He said \"you don't look like a customer\" and \"you people come in here and act a type of way\". I was alone and thought he'd mistaken me for a previous patron. I asked him if he was joking about the \"you people\" and the \"you don't look like a customer\" comments. I told him that I dine there all the time. He said \"you need to understand that I'm a business owner and I don't want certain people in here\". Shocked, I went to the restroom to call my husband so he could hear what was happening. I then went to place my order and the same man now behind the counter said \"what's your name\"? I told him my name (still in shock and waiting for cameramen to jump out). I asked his name and he said \"Felix and I'm the owner\".  As he rang me up he said \"sorry about earlier but you people really can be a type of way\". I'd had enough at that point and said \"had you not treated me with such a discriminatory tone I would have spend my money here\". I walked out, still on the phone with my husband, and I went to the clothing store next door. After being in there for 5-8 mins Felix walked in and processed to harass me in the store next door!! I shit you not!! I have several witness. I seriously recommend that people who \"don't look like customers\" or fall into the category of \"you people\" to dine elsewhere. Horrible experience nonetheless I will continue to enjoy, just Arepas someplace else. Hey Felix..go Google the racist Starbucks incident. You may learn something. Anyone else who experience this type of harassment from this place to please message me.",

    "text": "Vegas goes Venezuelan.  These arepas and empanadas are the hottest things to come out of Venezuela since their women! While they lack a sultry accent and their physical appearance isn't as stunning, these bites are just as alluring as any Venezuelan vixen.  In pursuit of another worthy eating destination away from The Strip, I learned of Viva Las Arepas from a local. It is on S. Las Vegas Blvd at Oakey just north of The Stratosphere. Before they were here, they operated out of a food stand.  The shredded chicken empanada ($2.75) was warm and crispy. After taking the first bite to expose the inside, I recommend throwing some of their green sauce into that bad boy to kick up the spice.   My garlic shrimp arepa ($7) was piping hot (in temperature) so I had to wait for it to cool down. It was moist and slightly started falling apart on me as I ate it. They stuff it with plenty of juicy shrimp so it was satisfying despite the challenge of taking it in. All other arepas cost less than the shrimp one. The shredded beef/Mechada ($6) is often my go to arepa.  You can bet I'll be back to get some nice Venezuelan ass too (or \"pork butt\" as it's called on their menu).  This area isn't particularly desirable or Vegasy but I'll take some arepas and empanadas over uninspiring overpriced Strip food any day. For those that are on a mission to find quality authentic food, and couldn't care less about glitz and glamour, this is your place!   Plus, the highly acclaimed Art of Flavors (gelato) is right next door (update/edit: it really isn't anymore as the Chef now works at Gelatology).",

We wanted to try something other than the usual Raising Canes or Aloha Kitchen and since we've never had Venezuelan food, we thought we'd give this place a shot. It was about a 5 minute walk from the hotel.  I ordered the Reina Pepiada which was a cold filling of chicken, mayo, avo, and cilantro. Boyfriend got a hot filling of roasted pork butt with tomato slices.  The arepas were pretty much small sandwiches with LOTS of filling. Don't underestimate the size. I had trouble finishing my own! The tortilla(?) they used as the \"buns\" reminded me of what they use for tamale wraps. And omg the sauces they provide you with are EVERYTHING. I drenched each bite with both!!! I read on Yelp that people were stealing the sauces so they don't give you the bottles until after you receive your meal. LOL! I would've been one of those perpetrators...  Don't forget to order either the mango or guava drink to wash the food down.  We'll be back to get more of the Reina Pepiada. That was a winner in our books!",

The prices are decent but can easily go up with the upgrades (adding avocado, cheese or egg) especially if you get all three. We had the mango water and it did not disappoint, each sip tasted like you were biting into a mango. Also, don't forget to try the fried plantains, a great choice to accompany your arepa or dessert. The only thing I didn't care for was the touch screen payment which gives you in big options to add a tip, especially since we were dining out. The girl was informative and nice so we gave her a tip but it's kinda like tipping at a fast food place. If they came and took your order at your table I would feel more comfortable tipping.   Overall, great choice!!",

I really haven't eaten a wide spectrum of arepas. I've had the veggie ($4) and camarones al ajillo ($5). The veggie is just meh, but the camarones with the side sauces is so good.   I guess it also helps that when I go, I'm normally hopped up on vodka and Danny G's karaoke from Dino's (shares a parking lot with Dino's). When I'm in that state, I have no discrimination filter and I love all food.   These tasty little pockets are yummy, but a little on the pricey side for the portion sizes. Though I've heard, but have no confirmation, that the corn meal is imported straight from Venezuela. Who knows. It sounds nice, though. So take your time and savor the taste and texture of the cornmeal pocket. So yummy.   You can also get tasty beverages like guanabana ($1.75)  to wash down your arepa. Wonderful.   Friendly staff.",

    "text": "First of all, I want to point out for the record to all my fellow mexican brethren and Mexican food lovers, a Venezuelan arepa is nothing more than a Mexican gordita! Delicious! I can't even tell you how many times we've passed this little spot on trips to downtown during Las Vegas trips past. I'm sure you've passed it a time or two if you are one of those people searching for the \"Pawn Stars\" pawn shop. Located on the corner of Las Vegas. Blvd. and Charleston Blvd not too far from the Stratosphere, this little shack should be added to your LV food agenda.   Six of us went, and five of us liked it and this is what we had:  Reina peinada- cold chicken salad with a cilantro and avocado cream sauce dressing. A little bland for my taste, but enhanced with some type of salsa they had, it was perfect. Not spicy, but had enough kick to add extra flavor. My wife said it had beer in it, but I couldn't taste it......probably cause I had already been drinking beer.  Ground beef- unanimous favorite of my group. Perfectly seasoned. Didn't need anything. Hot, juicy and flavorful!  Pastrami and cheese- supposed to be cold,  came out hot, probably from grilling the arepa. Not bad, but nothing special I'd say, lose the pastrami and just get one with cheese all on its own cause that's all I really tasted on this one, and the cheese was good.  Agua de panela- sugar cane juice with lime. Picture looks more like piloncillo/panocha, brown sugar-ish. Very tasty. Reminded me of agua de tamarindo or malta which was probably the tang from the lime. Everyone in my group liked it but kept fighting about whether it would go better with tequila or vodka. Guess I'll just have to take both next time to test it out, all in the name of science of course! All in all   will have to come back to try other things on the menu. Ran in to a lady in line that was from Venezuela and she said she and her family love it and go there at least once a week because its the real deal",

When you walk in you are transported to another country. The interior is orange and yellow with Spanish music on the radio. The man behind the counter is cordial but definitely gets down to business. I ordered the pork butt and my husband ordered the shredded beef. We decided to share an order of fried plantains and a mango drink. We chose a booth and waited for our number to be called. They were quick and everything is served on a tray with 2 squeeze bottles of condiments on the side. The Arepas were absolutely delicious! I loved the \"bun\" which is more like a thick and crumbly corn tortilla. It was delicate and delicious. The meat was melt in your mouth cooked to perfection. I even stole a few bites of my husband's and it was also absolutely perfect. The fried plantains were not my favorite, definitely going for the fries next time. The mango drink was not too sweet, but the perfect way to quench your thirst on a hot Vegas day. Overall, we loved the food and the price. We will definitely be back very soon!",

This place is way off from the usual hang out areas, but it's worth the trip if you have a car, are willing to walk to bfe, or take a taxi to bfe (by Vegas standards).  I ordered the shredded beef with passion fruit juice to wash it all down. The price was really cheap ($4 for the arepas and $2.50 for the drink) and completely worth it. The arepas was super tasty (and I really want to know what the \"bun\" was made out of. It came with two sauces that I have no idea what they were, but I used them anyway. One was spicy and the other was creamier - I of course, went for the spicier one because it has more flavor to bust through the strong flavors of the shredded beef and added a bit of a kick to the food. So so so worth it. The juice was really delicious and not overly sweet.",

Amazingly flavorful little Venezuelan sandwiches, super friendly guys working, they let you bring beer from White Cross market across the street, and occasionally you get weird stuff happening: last time a woman was loitering outside and ended up flashing us all for no apparent reason.

    "text": "This place has changed a bit since it first opened, or at least a year or so ago when if you had asked me about it, I would have RAVED. It's still good, decent, and interesting food, but something seems to have fallen off in terms of quality, flavor, and maybe even cooking technique, I'm not sure. Also, there is a real grunge factor here that was not here when we used to come here a year or two ago.  It just feels dirty now.  Our table was dirty and the bathrooms don't feel sparkly.  The process to put away your tray basket is just a little off-putting--at the trash can, it's just gross.  This is kind of like how Rubio's does it, but they're a chain.  They should have someone come pick up the baskets. No one comes by to wipe down the tables, or brush crumbs off seats.  The customer service seems lacking.They can't control the weird folks who come in here for arepas--a delicious specialty of Venezuela; think Jamaican beef patties.  But with the proper atmosphere, they would attract a less volatile crowd, for lack of a better word.  It used to be trendy, now it feel grungy.  Does that make sense? It may depend on what time of day or what day of the week you come.  A Sunday night, when we went, might not be its best.  With that said, if you have a hankering for Venezuelan food, or arepas in particular, you could do a lot worse than here.  The chicken (salad) arepas are unique with a piquant taste (not quite spicy).  I prefer the grilled chicken, and then pork or beef arepas, which are chock full of meat with crispy corn covering.  Vegetables are not too big here, but there is lettuce. Parking can be challenging.  It is a small lot.",

It was a perfect combination of beef, black beans, and plantains.   The customer service was just as spectator. I took a cab to the restaurant and left my cell phone in the cab. The owner looked at the cameras and help me track the cab company down. Fortunately, I was able to get my phone back. He definitely went above and beyond.   Overall, great service and amazing food.",

But I had never had the Venezuelan arepa and to my delight, enjoyed such a satisfying meal that it compelled me to write my first spontaneous review within the same day of eating at a restaurant. This place is a hidden gem off the main strip, near the Stratosphere and I Luv it Custard that is well worth the visit!   They cook using wood...the meat is savory and soft, juicy...the flavors are full and satisfying...We tried the arepa with shredded beef, as well as the carne asada oneand the vegetarian arepa along with the plantains and fried yuca...YUM!! The cilantro and hot sauces were delicioso!!! Try a Malta Polar or Frescolita to drink or my favorite ever, fresh squeezed passion fruit juice for some different and delicious flavors.  But whatever you do get yourself to Viva Las Arepas pronto!",

The interior was very clean and they even have a bilingual menu with a wide assortment of options beyond just arepas.   The portions are large. Even with a healthy appetite I was only able to eat one of the two arepas I ordered. The bean and cheese arepa was delicious, but just a little on the bland side of flavor. The shredded beef arepa was more flavorful. They have a spicy green mole sauce and a tangy cilantro sauce which are served with your food, if you enjoy more flavor.  The service itself was attentive, well thought out, friendly and helpful.   All in all a good spot for great food, great service and an interesting experience. I would definitely recommend Viva Las Arepas to anyone who enjoys Latin flavors or more specifically, authentic Venezuelan cuisine.",

    "text": "Viva Las Aperas is located on Las Vegas Boulevard near the Stratosphere Hotel. Parking is limited. When we got there there was hardly any people and it was supposed to dinner time but about fifteen minutes later the place became semi packed. We wanted to try a little bit of each different type of meat so we order the beef empanada, a chicken empanada, shrimp arepas, and the pork shoulder arepas. I thought everything was good. The empanadas seemed made to order as it came to our table piping hot and delicious with shredded pieces of meat in them. Both arepas were loaded with meat and sandwiched between a piece of pita bread the size of quarter pounder bun. The pork shoulder arepas was loaded with about three quarters of an inch meat flavored in a delicious sauce. The shrimp arepas was served cold and filled with about eight medium to large shrimp marinated in a garlicky sauce.  The pictures I have are of both the empanadas and the arepas cut in half to show its meaty interior.",

I recommend to get the Reina Pepiada which is grilled chicken and has a bold flavor with a creamy sauce which consists of avocado and cilantro.

Excellent! We finished off with pastelitos for desert. Best food value we've had in Vegas.",

    "text": "Wow!  Something new to myself, never tried anything quite like this and I'm glad I had! This place has grew over the years to this new massive location and I can see why, Viva las Arepas is consistently busy! Must be the lovely little handheld Arepa that keep attracting this crowd of gastro daredevils.  Looking at the huge menu it's hard to decide from all the tasty choices, and simple ask of what's popular to the cashier will leave you satisfied. By recommendation I got the wood-fired shredded beef arepa(with cheese *A must!*) and a shredded beef empanada while my guest decided to go for the chicken breast with avocado and cilantro arepa. Omg these savory little corn meal sandwiches are awesome! It has deep flavors that keep you wanting more, everything taste so fresh and homemade not any of that frozen precooked junk that gets passed off on the daily from something so widely known. They also have one of the best hot sauces that I've tasted in Vegas, the suttle spice and richness of the sauce reminded me of La Vic's orange sauce for all you Bay Area folk, and a creamy cilantro sauce to cut the spice if it's not for you!  I will definitely be back here, although for the actual size it could be kinda pricey $4-6 depending on filling and +.50-1.00 for avocado and cheese. Empanadas was $3 for a decent size, they usually have some sort of special going on just pay attention to the small signs near the register! Viva!",

    "text": "So, I have a thing for zombies. Fast zombies, slow zombies, evil zombies, dead zombies, live zombies, zombies with souls, brain-eating zombies, vegan zombies, rotting zombies -- you name it, I don't discriminate.  I tell you this because, deep in my bones, I believe that The Zombie-pocalypse is imminent. On occasion, I contemplate prepping a go-bag for the day it happens. In addition to the necessities such as puppies and kittens, suspenders, mint juleps, Uggs (as previously referenced), and a pure white bathrobe, it is essential I obtain one fresh meal prior to the collapse of civilization.  Allow me to present the Yelpzombie scale:  FIVE: Would push mother into approaching zombie horde in order to obtain (In-n-Out). FOUR: Would give up left arm to be gnawed on by zombified best friend (Chick-fil-A). THREE: Would trade one roll of toilet paper for (Jack in the Box). TWO: Viva Las Arepas. ONE: Given a choice of an Oprah marathon and ___________, Oprah wins. (McDonalds. Not counting Sausage Egg McMuffins here.)  As you can see, I have a refined palate. Is there any doubt that I am a True foodie?  ---------------------------------------------------------  Back to business. You could get an arepa for ~$5.50, but without cheese (+$.50), avocado ($+.99), and a fried egg ($.99), what's the point? You wouldn't be getting the full experience. So we're up to 8 bucks. And you won't be full. Your stomach will curse you for your stinginess and punish you with pangs of fury. Now throw in fries, yucca root, or plantains for $3.00, and you're sitting at $11.00. Even with the extras and factoring in that some of you have pinholes for mouths, you will certainly consume your arepas in 3 bites, give or take 2 bites.  Post-tax, that's a 4:1 bite to dollar ratio. FOUR dollars per bite! Now let's take a look at French Laundry. The tasting menu runs 10 courses long and will set you back a mere $295. If we say each course is 8 bites, after tax and tip, it comes out to 4 dollars per bite. So, think hard, Viva Las Arepas or French Laundry? The answer is obvious. Don't fight math.  As an aside, Yelp, can you add a dollar:bite field to restaurant listings? Please? Imagine how much more engaging eating and review-writing would be. Every bite would literally be counted. And each bite could be individually reviewed. How much fun would that be? We'd all eagerly embrace it, especially the elites. Don't even deny that it wouldn't happen.  ---------------------------------------------------------  Our table ordered three different arepas, the plantains, and the yucca. I got the beef (aka carne asada, yes, the translation makes little sense). I loved the plaintains -- they were deep fried and carmelized. Everything else was plain. Even drenching the arepas in the provided sauces could not salvage the bland mediocrity that I had invited into my mouth. I asked my dining mates to describe the two sauces and here is what our committee of three decreed:  Sauce one: lighter green, spicer, less creamy. Sauce two: darker green, less spicy, more creamy.  So descriptive, you're welcome. Now that I've saved you the trouble of spending your precious time and money here, let's discuss what you'd put in your go-bag.",

I swear it tastes like potato inside which is much nicer than corn according to me.  We ordered the pork and beef and they were both delicious. The pork had avocado and the other one, the beef, had a slice of tomato. The flavoring reminds me of Brazilian meats which has a nice grilled citrusy flavor. It's got a tang to it too and you don't really need to add any sauce to it.  But it does come with 2 squirter Bottles of sauce. One spicy,  not really, it's as spicy as El Patio sauce. The mild is mild.",

This is not a full dining experience - you go to the counter, order food, give your name and go pick up your own food. We left a nice tip but this hardly garnered a smile from staff. That said, the food was quite decent and we are familiar this cuisine. I recommend the arepas with beef (pabellon) and also the chicken arepa with avocado (reina pepiada) , the shredded beef empanada, the fried plantains (a must!) and the tequenos (another huge must). Even cold, the tequenos were good later. And this comes from me, a non-cheese lover. They were delicious - beautiful, firm white cheese - we got 4 of them to go and they were gone quickly. The food was authentic in taste and we would come back for another lunch. Prices were reasonable enough for the quality.",

A half grilled chicken with black beans and rice, an arepa pepiada, yuca fries, empenadas and pasteles... seriously, anything you order will satisfy your hunger.   Go before lunch and beat the rush! Customer service is always on point. Everyone that works there is so friendly and willing to explain the menu.",

With the masa/bun holding it together- I didn't get a big hit of corn till the end, which was fine (I do love corn tortillas though). The one episode I watched, they did a classic Chicken, Avocado, and Mayo Arepa, three of my favorite items! I chose that #7.   I got a side of plantains, one sweet and one not- tbh I couldn't tell the difference, they were delicious! The dipping sauce was a mixture of cream cheese, butter, and sugar and more like a frosting (not my fave). I also got the black beans and white rice, delicioso!   I went to the Strip location and the area was not the best but that's where you usually find the best food! I also took my order to go, since it was close to closing time so I don't really have a review on the restaurant itself!",

I've had:  * Shredded Chicken (Onion, Tomato, Garlic)  * Roasted Pork Butt (Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices)  * Reina Pepiada (Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas)  * Vegetarian (Avocado, Black Beans, Tomatoes, Grilled Peppers, Onions)  I have been satisfied with every one of them. My boyfriend has had the Beef, Pork, and Beef Tongue. His remarks are that they are good, hearty and inexpensive. One is enough for me on each visit because they can fill you up rather quickly. I love their sauces! There is a creamy cilantro dressing and a nice and spicy green sauce, which I drizzle over my Arepa!  Authentic, fresh ingredients, fast and friendly service. This place has become one of my favorite spots to go to when I'm craving Venezuelan food.  Also, don't forget their Hallacas (A mix of beef, pork, chicken, capers, raisins, olives, and vegetables on cornmeal dough, wrapped with plantain leaves, that is bolied) They are like my mother's Central American tamales and they are GOOD!  I feel the flavors are great, but I have a low sodium diet most of the time and felt it was a tad too salty, but that's just me. Nothing that bothers me too much, but giving the heads up for those picky eaters.",

We tried the roasted pork butt arepa with cheese and another arepa with chicken breast and avocado (their most popular). The corn cakes they were served in were some of the best gluten-free concoctions my girlfriend and I have tried since identifying our respective gluten sensitivities. They were cooked throughout and crispy golden brown on the outside with soft fluffy insides. For sides, we shared the fried plantains, perfectly caramelized and cooked through with a little tangy acid to balance the sweet caramelly starch, and the rice with vegetables. The side sauces were great but not really necessary because the food was seasoned and prepared excellently already. As someone who appreciates value and feeling satisfied after a meal, I should add that our dinner was one of the best prepared meals for under $20 I've ever had if it wasn't the very best.

We ordered the grilled chicken arepas and black bean and cheese empanadas.  The food took almost 20 minutes to come out and it wasn't that busy around 5:30 pm on a Friday evening. The arepas look kind of small, but they were much bigger and stuffed so we really didn't need the empanadas!  The cornmeal breading was so yummy and the grilled chicken, lettuce, tomato and cheese was really good. They served their hot sauce and another sauce with cilantro/mayo on the side which were good complements but not necessary with the arepas.  The empanadas were greasy and only half filled on the inside, but tasty.  Didn't have any room for the guava/cheese pastelito, but would love to try it next time!",

    "text": "I could of sworn I wrote a review for Viva Las Arepas a few years back, my apologies. I began coming and enjoying these delish arepas when this establishment was the humble little shack across the parking lot now replaced by an up and coming gourmet sandwich joint. My first time here the owners kid was out behind the shack and some drunk women was walking up and the down the street cursing and confronting customers so I called the cops and my mom went to go talk to the little girl and her mom so she wouldn't be scare. The chef was busy so as a thank you he gave us a few free orders of the cheese sticks. After that I became a regular.   The pork arepa is filled with really tender pulled pork but I always order without the tomato slice. The shrimp arepa is really yummy too, sauteed shrimp in a mild spicy condiment sauce served hot. The bean an cheese arepa, can nothing go wrong with those!!! Finally but not least, the Reina Pepiada is my absolute favorite!!! It is made with shredded chicken, mayo, avocado, peas and cilantro.   The arepas are served in rustic baskets which I hate because when people spill their arepa juice, how do they clean them? I eat mine over the paper they come in. The new locating is sooo nice and big too. Their menu is extensive, it contains other Venezuelan goodies like cachepas which are these sweet little pancakes. The parking lot is still limited but I never have a problem and I'd walk a few blocks to try these guys out, trust me!!!",

    "text": "My first Arepas and is was Viva Las Vegas good!  I had to try this place after reading Craig R's review.  I've never had an Arepas before so I was looking forward to trying it.  This place is a stand alone shack on the corner at the end of the north side of the strip.  Seriously its a shack, you cant miss it cuz it sticks out!!!  They have some tables set outside so there are places to for you to eat there.  Saw a few that just swung by and got it to go.     An Arepa is a flat, round and soft patty made out of cornmeal, which is grilled, making it crispy on the outside and soft on the inside, and then it can be stuffed with beef, chicken, ham, cheese, beans, shrimp, and many more. These delights are gluten-free, and wheat-free.  Aside from arepas (hot/cold) they also serve empanadas and hallacas which are like tamales.  SInce I was having a really late dinner I decided to try 2 and got a #5 and #7 with a mango drink to wash is down.  I sat down and waited about 10 min and the guy brought it out.   #5 Roasted Pork Butt  (Pernil) which is Slow Cooked Marinated Pork, Fresh Tomato Slices and cheese.  Damn this was tasty good.  Great flavored pork, tender and juicy.  The cornmeal was grilled perfectly with a crisp!  #7 Reina Pepiada which is Shredded Chicken Breast, Avocado,  Mayonnaise, Cilantro, Green Peas.  Was like a chicken salad as this was a cold version.  They look small but they are actually pretty big and was only able to eat half of this one as I was totally full.   The guy told me about the 2 homemade sauces they have on the table.  One is green and a milder version but with a really good flavor.  I would buy some of this good stuff.  The red was obviously spicy and so I didn't really use it but it was good.    This place may look questionable but let me tell you this is a great hole in the wall place to hit up when your in LV.  It's way off the strip so you wont have to deal with lines and strip prices.  They have great tasty food   Eyes ~ Ok its on the corner and the seats are pretty much on the sidewalk. Nose ~ Not much to smell when your outside and the wind whipping! Ear ~ Cars cars cars! Mouth ~ Damn tasty arepas! Tummy ~ Stop stuffing more food mouth, I'm freaking full yo!",

I'm very glad I didn't immigrate to Venezuela as I would probably would have ended up being a 400lb whale on the beach snacking on Arepas all day.  Once again the Yelp community didn't steer me wrong. For weeks I've been seeing yelpers rave about this place, so I decided it was time.  Located on Las Vegas Blvd and East Oakey Blvd, Viva Las Arepas is a store down from the other favorite Art Of flavors. The parking is very limited, so be prepared to maybe park somewhere close by. Trust me the walk is worth it.  After going around their menu I decided why not the Pork and chicken Arepas. Served on a rectangular  dish, they were served pretty much hamburger style. With a hot sauce and what seemed like a tart sauce are served with your meal. Both dishes bursts with flavor. The breading I think was freshly made. Big credit. Very filling meal if your trying one or two.   To drink they have canned soft drink and bottled water. The real stuff is the juices they have on tap. I can not remember what juice I had but it was a suger cane drink of some sort. It complemented the meal quite well. Tell your friends, this place is bomb  Overall Service: 4-5 Drink: 4-5 Food: 5-5 Cleanliness: 4-5 Coming back: Yess",

Unique, fresh flavors for me, totally unique & worth trying. Don't write it off as \"beans again\", or compare it to other Latin cuisines. Even the salsa is different & yummy. Even the peppers/chiles used inside the arepa - not sure if they use ajis dulces chiles, but they are not your run-of-the-mill serrano/jalapeno/habanero/etc. Mmm!  Affordable, relatively quick, veg friendly, just can't beat it.  P.S. Tostone Lovers: I really love the tostones across the street at Florida Cafe, esp. with the yummy mojo de ajo (different style of cuisine, I know), but shhhh...these are fresher, faster, and better.",

I'll order that next time.   - Ideal for a quick snack or to-go, since this little shack really is a glorified food truck. - Plastic is accepted, but bring ca$h if you're only ordering one item, since all the arepas are between $3 - $5. - I guess the juices are made from fresh fruit (yay!), because guava wasn't in stock the day I went (boo!) - No clearly defined parking spaces - we parked right by the shack - Misters out front kept our skin hydrated in the scorching heat",

It's  a little worn down, in a part of town I would best describe as 'sketchy', but clean and a convenient location if you happen to be downtown or checking out 'First Friday'.  If you're looking for gourmet food, this isn't your stop, but check it out if you want consistently delicious, filling food reminiscent of what your grandmother would make. It's also decently priced and quickly made.  I would recommend the fried plantains. They are great and not something you can find on many menues (fried bananas which are sweet but compliment a savory meal -not dessert). They of course have the meat staples, chicken, steak, and pork but have a vegetarian option as well.   Lastly, if you're looking for a late meal after a night of drinking - you can't go wrong here!",

A block or two away from the Stratosphere and also behind a neighbor filled with hipsters and retirees. It's cultured to say the least. Depending on when you go, the parking lot is not to spacious and there's always ongoing traffic... just be careful.  VENUE: Stands out with its bright yellow interior. It makes me feel mellow and happy to be inside &good memories every time I drive past. There's also Venezuelan gelato shop right next door which its it feel very authentic. Along with the yellow, the photos of the menu all around and make my mouth watery as I try to figure out what to order. Music is welcoming and the bathroom is clean and might I add, cozy. Find out for yourself, lol.  CUSTOMER SERVICE: Very accommodating, always friendly as well as fast.  FOOD: There are two sauces you have to try! I always get my garlic shrimp arepa along with an empanada or two.... along with some fries and rice if I'm really hungry. The first time I came with my vegan friend and she devoured as much as I did on her own terms, so I'd always like to think this place is vegan-friendly. I'm never disappointed with my order because the food is always consistent and more than anything else, delicious!  OVERALL: I've recommended this place numerous times to people. I've tried an arepa from a food truck and nothing compares to VIVA LAS AREPAS! I've been in love with this place since it was a small food stand and if you're craving something that you fill you up with warmth and carbs. THIS IS IT!",

But I've had 90% of the menu and have never  been disappointed.",

First of all the guy behind the counter said, don't worry, everything will be marked. Absolutely nothing was marked and we had to try and figure out what our orders were since they were all thrown together. Secondly, one of the sandwiches we ordered was missing...so we had to share what we had because it was too much of a pain in the ass to drive all the way back to make a stink.   On top of that, I personally thought that the food was a bit greasy. I didn't love it. My other three friends did like the food, but didn't really get enough to eat. Everyone was a bit disappointed. They're willing to try again and give them another chance. I will if I'm dragged along.  Overall, I would say there's a lot of unwarranted hype about this dirty little stand.",

    "text": "At present, with over 1300 reviews averaging 4.5 stars, is an impressive feat. It's also enough to lure me away from my original plan of getting some BBQ nearby.    Viva Las Arepas is a Venezuelan food restaurant. It's located on the corner of a mostly industrial area that's also surrounded by fast food joints. There must be something amazing about these folks because the back wall has some media mentions on display.    Not knowing much about their cuisine, I saw that most Yelpers raved about the wood fire beef arepas. Just the name alone speaks mouth-watering meat. It seems to be a white corn shell grilled, and stuffed with chopped beef cooked over mesquite wood for that very noticeable smokiness. This is served with lettuce & tomato. It comes out blazing hot, I kid you not, so wait a minute before you burn your face.   Reina Pepeiada is the corn shell stuffed with chicken, but drenched in a cooking cilantro sauce.   Both were excellent but if I had the choose one, it'd be the wood fire beef.  Arepas come with 2 sauces. One is hotter than the other but both were great over the wood fire beef.   Fried plantains were decent, but very heavy. They come out blazing hot and stay that way for a while.   We also tried the 'drink of the day' strawberry juice.  Just the right amount of sweet and very refreshing. A refill for 2 bucks, and tried the passion fruit.  A bit tart so it's really not my fav.    Service was pleasant. The lady at the counter knew it was obviously our first time so she was patient in explaining things.   It's very casual here. Orders are placed at the counter and your name called when order is ready.  Photos of their menu items line the perimeter of the frame right below the ceiling and there are 4 TV's covering each corner of the dining area.  Stacks of mesquite wood can be seen towards the restroom.   I'm also giving Viva Las Arepas a 4.5, but can't justify rounding up to a 5, since it's not exactly perfect in every way.  But without a doubt, I'll be back for more of that smoky wood fire beef.",

I had the #7 Reina Pepiada - which had chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It was very creamy and the chicken was crispy and flavorful. I also had the #12 Pabellon - which had beef, black beans, plantain and cheese. The sweetness of the plantain with the meat and beans made a great combination.  Overall 5/5 for flavor, affordability, and quality. My only caveat would be to not expect a fancy restaurant. The setting is very fast food like.",

Others may love it, but it wasn't for me. I probably should have went for beef and chicken instead.   You can also add cheese and avocado for extra. I got both, but I think if I have a chance to come back, I'd probably go without it. The cheese didn't really add anything.   It's a little bit away from the strip, but a quick uber/taxi ride away.

I should have known better than to not ask the peppers to be taken off, but it wasn't the end of the world, just a preference. I've had both the plantains and fried yucca and can vouch for both, they're amazing. Just a warning, their salsa is HOT. Normally I can take a little heat, but I didn't have the courage to drizzle it all over my arepa. The creamy cilantro sauce is to die for, I always ask for extra and dip my yucca in there.",

It came with a slice of tomato and letucce.  Eat it with the creamy green sauce and your taste buds will thank you!   Even though I really enjoyed it I felt that $6 for an Arepa seemed a bit too much.  Extra for cheese $0.60, Avocado $.99, ...  I will come back when in town for a quick bite.  Cheers!",

They have two sauces they give you, a red sauce and green sauce, my favorite was the green. We also tried the fried plantains and bean and cheese empanadas, which were also tasty. Our friends had the beef and fries which were very good. Also, don't forget the Passion fruit drink, I couldn't get enough of this stuff!  We will definitely frequent this place more when we are in Vegas! Friendly staff, clean, kid friendly, and fast service. It is located in a small corner strip mall with a few parking spaces.",

The texture of the arepa dough was fresh and smooth and both meats inside were so good!   First time trying Venezuelan rice and beans. The beans tasted almost like Cuban black beans. They were very well seasoned. The rice was so different from other Latin rice dishes. It was made with basmati (I think) I'm used to regular long grain rice but it was still yummy.   For drink, soursop (or guanabana) and passion fruit. I really liked how both had great, authentic fruit flavor but they were on the less sweet side.

He made some recommendations and threw in some samples of other things he recommended for next time we visited.   I went with the shredded chicken arepa and the shredded beef. They were both delicious.   The only reason I didn't give them a 5 is because I asked for both of them with no cheese and I had to eat just the meat on one of them because the arepa had cheese on it.

The beans were so flavorful and they do not skimp on the cheese here. Even the arepa itself was not heavy and held the beans and cheese really well, so it didn't get messy while eating it.  4 stars - Cachapa. It was like a folded over corn griddle cake with melted cheese inside. It had a sweet flavor from the corn and the savory of the cheese to balance out the flavor. I liked eating this with the squeeze of homemade green hot sauce they give you in a squeeze bottle. Spicy, but good!!  3 stars - Fried plantains. I'm a big fan of fried plantains and usually order them whenever they're on the menu. In this case, the fried plantains could have been more sweet by letting them ripen just another day or two before cooking them. The preparation was spot on, with a golden brown glow because it was fried. Just a bit sweeter and this would have been a five in my book.  Overall, they've got a great selection of items, a clean restaurant, and the staff is very friendly.",

    "text": "I love arepas and I've only had them at one place in LA. I was excited that my Venezuelan friends know about this place and actually recommend it. I came with my friend that has never had arepas and he loved it. If you don't know what arepas are... then Google it because I already explained what they are on my Amara review lol.  Reina Pepiada - Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. This was a lot different from the one I had in LA. The chicken breast is chopped and minced so finely that its almost like a paste - I prefer chicken cubes or chunks for a bite. Really good though.  Pabellon - Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my go to. I love the sweet plantains paired with the salty cheese. The beef was super tender and juicy.  Really good place for affordable and quick meal. Friendly staff too!",

We got the pabellon arepa and a carne mechada empanada the first day and the Reina pepiada, tostones, and Chicharrones and fried yuca the second day. All with fresh strawberry juice, jugo de fresa! Deliciousness topped off with their homemade salsas. The salsa de ajo was the best. Btw, my husband is Venezuelan and said this was the most authentic food he's had in the states.",

The staff are friendly, the place is cleaned, they have the English menu on one side and Spanish menu on the other side. They have pictures of the food along the wall that help if you are a first timer. We ordered tons of food to tried. Tequenos is probably about 4-5 inches long. Pretty good size. It was very good. Arepas con carne mechada with cheese- the meat was very good and flavorful. Arepa con pollo with mayo and cilantro. Wow!!! That was fantastic. It's a must try. We also order cachapas too- very good. You will not go wrong with any of the item on the menu. Will definitely come back again if we are in Vegas.  The only thing is they don't have chicha- little disappointing.",

They are the best, in the order of a Mexican gordita. Usually made to order fresh and yummy. They are stuffed with meat, cheese, or vegetarian, and the menu reflects availability. They also  have nice salsa, and fried plantains. I tried queso, and pork, excellent.  This is casual , lunch or dinner , we wanted to try everything so it got a bit pricey, but really worth it, although 1 is enough for each person.  Enjoy anytime your in the area (near Stratosphere).",

My carne asada was watery and the cheese was not melted . The french fries were below my standard for good/great quality. Just decent.  I would come back and get the pork butt arepa w plantains again. Its decent food. It beats fast food. Its inexpensive. And I hate eating on the Las Vegas strip for reasons I wont mention.",

Based on the staff's explanations of the food, we decided on several items.  The first item that we tried was called the Reina pepiada.  This arepa was loaded with shredded chicken, avocado, mayo, cilantro, and green peas.  It was pretty tasty, but I liked the other 3 items better.  The second item was garlic shrimp.  As the name says, the arepa was filled with garlic shrimp and it was delicious.  The third item was Lengua.  This arepa was filled with beef tongue, bell peppers, tomato, onion, and garlic.  It was yummy.  The last item was the Pernil arepa.  It is roasted pork butt inside.  It was marinated just right, and it was my favorite of the four items.  The location is not great, but the staff is really cool and helpful.  I recommend giving them a try.  We will be back.    Oh, and another plus is you can go to Luv It Custard for dessert cause it is located really close by!!",

    "text": "Hidden Gem Hole in the wall Small crappy looking shack that serves delicious grub  All three of these phrases perfectly describe Viva Las Arepas, but I like the third one the best!  Located at the end of the strip, on Las Vegas Blvd, just a few blocks past the Stratosphere Hotel, sits a small, ugly white shack in a deserted parking lot that serves up some of the tastiest little snacks in all of Las Vegas.   Viva Las Arepas serves up some of the best tasting Arepas I've ever eaten. For those of you who aren't familiar with Arepas, they're pretty much small, fried cornmeal pockets stuffed with meats, cheese, veggies, sauce, etc, etc. Viva also makes empanadas, a few hot dogs, aguas frescas, and a few sweet treats like flan and more. They also have these two amazing shack-made sauces. One is a lime green color that's mild but has an amazing flavor and the other is a spicy red sauce. Since my wife and I were going to have a big dinner the same day we visited Viva, we decided to just get a few items to try. This is what we purchased;  Lengua Arepa W/ White Cheese & Avocado Slices <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=8lN2NE_nQzG-VFNGfeR1hA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCI...</a> Ground Beef & Shredded Cheese Arepa  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=-dY7b8L5QpT1MPtSHG34ug\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCI...</a> Black Bean & Cheese Empanada <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=D_dkKgnCHti4moXUxO85vQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCI...</a>  All three items were incredibly delicious. The cornmeal pockets were perfectly fried yet still had a soft center. The Lengua, which was shredded and cooked in a delicious sauce, was my fave of the two. It was savory, sweet and slightly spicy all at the same time. The ground beef Arepa reminded me of a Taco Bell Chalupa, but obviously much better. The black bean and cheese empanada was also very good.   To wash down our yummy snacks we had a large Passion Fruit aguas frescas. It was super sweet and super refreshing. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCIojgP5KTr1leaysFE3A?select=Wz0vow2OgM5E5N6lMQP07Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/EnCI...</a>   The prices for each Arepa are about $3 or $4 bucks a piece, which isn't too bad considering how delicious they are. The guys who were working in the shack were all friendly and got our food out to us quickly.   If you're in LV and feel like something quick, tasty and cheap, don't go to some crappy chain place like McDonald's, head on down to Viva Las Arepas and treat yourself to some phenomenal Arepas. Trust ME.",

I was eating at a nearby restaurant and my constant companion remarked that he'd never eaten Venezuelan food before, so we should come back and try this place.  Since then I've been to Viva Las Arepas several times -- usually with visitors in tow.  It's one of my favorites and a nice find on the North end of the Strip.  My favorite is the chicken Arepa (with cheese, dripping in the creamy cilantro sauce).  It's my favorite because the chicken tastes of this fantastic smokey flavor I've not found elsewhere in Vegas.  I've also had their whole chicken (a favorite with my constant companion) and the meat just melts in your mouth.  Is it a healthy choice for your stay in Las Vegas?  Probably not.  However, it is likely one of the most delicious.  I once took my fabulously unadventurous younger brother here, and he and his friends absolutely loved it.  To address concerns raised by other visitors -- yes the restaurant itself is not in a particularly glitzy part of town; however, it is in an area that is in the process of being revitalized.  The restaurant is clean and well kept, and I've never had any problems in the neighborhood.  The food is worth it!  I have plans to go back in the near future.",

    "text": "*3.5 stars*  We checked this little food stand out after our friend raved about it and mentioned that it was featured on Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives.    I ordered the Chicken (Pollo Mechado) Arepas and the Beef Empanada.  I ate the empanada in the car and it was definitely fresh and hot (so hot I burned the roof of my mouth on it) ;(   We waited until getting back to the hotel to have the Arepas.  Tip: make sure you have wet wipes and a lot of extra napkins....there is no pretty way to eat this bad boy!  While it was definitely flavourful, and filled with meat (you definitely get your money's worth), I found it way too filling. Also, by the time we got back to the hotel, the arepa had sadly gone soggy.  But the accompanying sauces were great toppers.    Value wise - it's a great value. $4 for a whole lotta meat!  And only $2 for the empanada.    That said, I almost feel bad about giving Viva Las Arepas a 3.5 rating, after seeing all the great reviews here.  I will definitely give Viva Las Arepas a chance again upon my next Vegas visit, and this time, I will make sure to enjoy my arepas right away.",

    "text": "It's a shame, but after each visit, I've become less and less impressed. My first visit was phenomenal and my second visit was still pretty great (as evidenced in my previous review). The Wood-Fired Beef was a bit dry during my third visit, but I brushed it aside attributing it to a fluke or bad timing. However, my last visit has solidified my disappointment and necessity to write an updated review.  Since I've had five of their arepa options, I decided it was time for another one, so I chose the Vegetarian (avocado, black beans, tomato, peppers, onion) for $5. I was confused at first because all I saw were black beans with a little bit of avocado barely surfacing (reference photo). Maybe they got my order wrong? I searched for vegetables through the beans with no success. It wasn't until I took a few bites that I finally located a very sad tomato piece. I figured that was just how they made the \"Vegetarian\" arepa. The beans were nicely seasoned, but their overwhelming quantity made it incredibly difficult to eat in an arepa. The arepa itself was delicious, as always. I was already disappointed by my selection because of the lack of vegetables, then I saw photos of what the Vegetarian Arepa should look like or have looked like and now I'm upset. It costs the same as or more than their meat options and they can't include a heap of vegetables? Not cool!  Also, after four visits, it doesn't seem like a coincidence that my table is consistently ignored. No one ever checks on us (it's usually me and Ruben), while they seem more than happy to visit and chat with several other customers. It has made us feel unwelcome. I'm really sad to say this, but I will be getting my arepas elsewhere from now on.",

The food is also really filling so one arepa will probably fill you up. Arepas range from $4-$7. Oh and their guava drink! Sooo good.   It's just a few minutes off the main strip between the strip & downtown. The parking lot is a bit small, but luckily when we went, there were available parking spots. It's a little hard to find and the lot is really small, but just look for the big orange AREPAS sign. If you're tired of the buffets, give this a try! It's definitely worth it!",

    "text": "I've eaten here a total of 2 times and the first time I wasn't sure on what to order so I had the shredded beef Arepa, I wasn't very impressed because It was nothing special. My friends felt the same way too and were so underwhelmed that we wondered why they have such awesome reviews from everyone else. Well I gave them another chance and I read Melissa Y.'s review before I ordered and she had suggested an Arepa that has a grilled meat. Well since I sometimes try to be on that healthy grind I had the grilled chicken Arepa and boy was she right it was sure tasty. There's 2 sauces they have on the side 1 that comes in a clear bottle and the other in a red bottle. The one in the clear is like a creamy herb sauce similar to Cafe Rio's ranch sauce but less creamy and more \"herby,\" I like it and gives the Arepa more flavor. I wasn't too sure about the red bottle, but my friends liked it as well and said the heat is good and slowly builds on you. Initially people are a little confused on how to describe what exactly an Arepa is. I was sort of describing it as a Taco bell Chalupa or Indian bread sandwiched together, however I was way off because my friend described it as an English Muffin made with corn meal, which is exactly what it is! The inside of this palce is very clean and depending on how busy it is will determine how long it will take  for your food. I was there last night and they served my friends within 5 minutes, but another time they took awhile like 10 to 15 minutes if I remember correctly. I also like the fact they are open late and next to Art of Flavors. There is plenty of indoor seating and this place has a good amount of people eating at night.",

I tried the wood fired chicken arepa and the chicken was very soft and the sauce in it went well. I put a lot of that green hot sauce in there though. It gave it more flavor. The carne asada arepa was super juicy. The only downside is that the bread got soggy towards the end. The woodfired chicken plate was very juicy too. The French fries were really crispy just how I like it and the basmati rice was too buttery for my liking but that's what makes it tasty. Overall, I would definitely go again and again!",

A bit of a bummer, but oh well. The guy behind to counter was very nice and helpful. He confirmed that they did indeed change the menu to give it a new feel. He also helped us out by telling us what was the most popular orders. We ended up just getting the pork butt arepa because we were a bit full. All I can say is they still got it! Still fresh, flavorful, and just delicious. I'll definitely be going back when I'm in the neighborhood.",

I actually am more into the Arepa than the filling in itself (haven't been wowed  by their fillings yet). But my second trip here was a little disappointing.   I ordered their menudo arepa and this time not even the arepa could save this extremely bad tasting menudo. The menudo was not seasoned enough and that's not something you want to do when serving menudo:(. The Arepa was very bland and dry like it was either left on the flat grill too long or it was reheated one to many times.   The setting is so unique and I do love that so I'm not giving up just yet and do plan to give this place a third try I just hope to be able to post a more positive update.

    "text": "Word is starting to spread about I Love Arepas and boy oh boy does it live up to all the buzz it's receiving. At a little less than $4 a pop, you're going to end up walking away from this food stand with a mouth full of smiles and belly full of happy.  If you asked me what an arepa was a few hours ago, I'd reply back with a blank stare and a scratch of the head. Ask me this in the present, and you'll find me blindingly reciting the Wikipedia description word-for-word, while dual-wielding an arepa in each hand.  The arepa is basically a fried flat cornmeal based sandwich filled generously with a meat of choice. Here, at I Love Arepas,  they have all of the usual meats that you'd find at a taco shop (beef, carne asada, shredded chicken/beef, tripe, lengua, etc.), along with their own unique concoctions.   Since it was my first visit I was recommended these two items: *#1 Carne Mechada - Shredded beef, bell pepper, onions, tomato, garlic *#7 Reina Pepiada - Shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayonnaise,  cilantro, green peas  I'd say that the #7 came out the winner in this one, but the carne mechada was at a close second due to how meaty it was (shredded beef lovers rejoice!). My mouth is flooding with drool now that I'm recalling what I ordered just a few minutes ago. I'm going to make it a mission to try every item on their menu. Before you know it, I'll be a stuffed, wobbling arepa machine by the time I'm through with it.  One downside about I Love Arepas is that it's located in Stabbytown, USA. The area isn't the greatest. If you've been to Luv It Frozen Custard (across the street), you'd know what I mean. If hobos don't scare you, give I Love Arepas a shot without hesitation. If the common-day bearded hobo does give you the willies, bring a friend along with you and share the love.",

    "text": "Hmm. Do I love arepas? Thanks to this tiny food stand under the shadow of the Stratosphere Tower, I'd have to say a resounding YES!  I had never heard of this culinary item until I found out about this place. Some compare arepas (Venezuelan) to pupusas (Salvadoran). It's a fair comparison, but they're not quite the same. I say the only real way to find out is to try them for yourself. You won't regret it.  I've been here twice now. First, I tried the tripe, which was killer. The next time, I tried the tongue, which was similarly murderous. Now, if you don't like tripe or tongue, this place isn't going to change your mind. Don't worry, they also serve your basic fillings, like beef and chicken.  Currently, the only problem I have with this place is the slow service. Basically, it's like the chef has to do all the work because the hired help is incredibly incompetent. Fortunately, the last time I was there, I talked to the chef and he said he hired a new employee and she was starting the next day. Honestly, it hasn't been a huge inconvenience so far, but if there ever was a long line here, watch out. I'm hoping the new employee works out.  In any event, I'm a fan of this place. Arepas, I love thee.",

    "text": "I stopped by I Love Arepas on the way home from a daytime pool session at the Golden Nugget. After swimming, sunning, and bearing that awesomely scary water slide, I was hungry but didn't want to fill up on anything too heavy in anticipation for a dinner later that night. So I figured arepas would be a good meal to hold me over without making me feel too full. And for less than $10 I was able to get 2 arepas and a drink. Not a bad deal!  They're open from 3pm to midnight everyday are located on the corner of Wyoming and LV Blvd, in the same parking lot as Dino's.   An arepa is most like a Venezuelan version of gordita, but it's stuffed with meat, cheese, or whatever else you'd like. I think my favorite part of the whole experience was the masa cake, because it was grilled but still soft and warm inside. They were obviously freshly made, and made really well.   I got the beef tongue arepa with had tomato, onion, and a green pepper in it. It was very greasy and messy, but not in a bad way where you feel like you need to run 10 miles after eating all that grease. The second arepas was the reina pepiada which was stuffed with cold chicken salad made with chicken, peas, avocado, onion, and was also very messy. They were both amazing tasting, and he gave me 2 sauces to go with them. One was a creamy cilantro-type dressing, and the second was more of a salsa-like one that tasted like it was made out of green peppers. The salsa one went really well with the beef tongue, and I felt that the reina pepiada didn't really need a sauce. I'm sure it goes well with something, but next time I stop by I'll try it with something else.   The passion fruit drink was good, but after I ordered it I saw he had soursop, which I'll definitely have to try next time.",

There are many more items on the menu now, which we plan to come back and try (grilled meat plates looked really good).  But today we were here for arepas.  We ordered four: wood fired beef and chicken, plus shredded beef and roasted pork, plus an empenada to share.  It did take a while to get our food, but that tells you that it's prepared fresh to order.  The plan was to each of us to take two, eat half of each, and then swap them, so we could both sample all four.  Halfway through the first one I realized that one was going to be my limit.  I started with the roast pork; my wife had the wood fired chicken.  They were as delicious as I remember.  We ended up taking home the two beef arepas.  The person who helped us was very friendly, he wrapped up our two untouched arepas, boxed them, gave us little containers of sauce and bagged the whole thing.  Definitely plan to come back here soon.  This town has such a great selection of ethnic dining.  We're seasonal residents, who normally live in the SF Bay Area (which is a real melting pot itself with great ethnic dining) and we are constantly finding little hole in the wall restaurants with great ethnic food.  If your idea of dining out is Outback Steakhouse or Olive Garden, you are really missing out.",

It's a mix between Pupusas and Empanadas, but the masa is completely different than flour. It's crispy and mealy - so perfect. Also, it's stuffed like a sandwich, with lettuce, tomatoes, sauce. So maybe it's more like a burger? Regardless, it's the best.  Our group were fatasses and totally ordered for a family of 12 when it was only 4 of us. But we got to try everything so it was worth it.   My favorite arepas was the Reina Pepiada and Roasted Pork Butt! Can't go wrong with either. The shredded chicken empanada was good here too.",

We were visiting in Vegas, looking for something awesome, but cheap to eat for lunch. Good old yelp, shows me Viva Las Arepas. We went on a mission and walked about 2 miles to get here from our hotel, but it was worth it. It's not in the nicest areas of town, actually it's not nice at all lol. But the place is very clean and has plenty of seating.   I ended up ordering the pork butt with avocado and tomato and it did not disappoint. It was soo good and only 5 bucks! My friend ordered the yuca fries and the plantains, and both were very tasty as well.   I can't get over how cheap and how good this place is. Awesome snack or lunch spot. Go get some!",

Not the greatest location and off the Strip close to the Stratosphere, but that's part of the charm.   We tried the standard beef and chicken arepas with a side of plantains. Definitely hit the spot! Make the trek north of the main casinos, and enjoy delicious, fresh, made-to-order, authentic South American food - you will be glad you did. And if you're into that sort of thing, drive just a little farther north and visit the Pawn Shop from the TV show \"Pawn Stars,\" and on your way back to the Strip hit up the Bonanza Gift Shop, which touts itself as the world's largest gift shop.",

    "text": "Flavorful experience!  I've had this place on my mind for several months and finally made our way over to it for a late lunch on a weekend. It was a beautiful day and wanted to enjoy our food outside since they have a cute little corner space.   We ordered - a chicken arepa with avocado and a pork butt one with cheese. Next came a beef empanada, fried plantains and a sugar cane drink with lime. The chicken arepa had some type of sauce on it and it was way too wet for my taste. I loved the pork butt and it was my favorite part of the meal, especially with the delicious creamy cilantro sauce over it! The beef empanada was ok, expected more flavor. The plantains were fantastic and the perfect way to end the meal. I would skip the sugar cane with lime drink as it was very sour.   Here's the rest of the story and why I couldn't give it a higher rating. As I mentioned above we chose to sit outside because the weather was perfect. A homeless man came over and sat next to our table and began staring at me. It was nearly impossible to enjoy my food and we ended up buying him food. He chose to sit next to us and eat it as he continued to stare me down. Then came over a couple who were high as kites and the male wanted to show us his junk. He was committed to this and with every passing minute was also screaming at his female friend. I wanted to crawl under the table.   So next time I'm siting inside no matter how beautiful it is outside!",

They were nice about replacing the item but we were pretty grossed out with the sanitation and meal.   Wood fire beef ($5.50): not much flavor to this and pretty dry  Pork butt ($4.50): meat was soft but pretty salty.  Reina pepieda ($5.50): the avocado helped give the arepa more flavor. Thought it would be weird because it was cold but this was my favorite of the three arepas.  Shredded Chicken empanada ($2.75): chicken was very good. Better meat than the meat in the arepas. These empanadas are fried. This was the best item we had.  Strawberry cherry drink ($2.75): tastes almost like fruit punch but refreshing break from all of the dry food.   Not sure if we missed the hot items but we were not impressed with the food and totally turned off by the hair in the food. It's a ways off of the strip and I wouldn't bother making the trek out here.",

First, the staff are attentive, quick, and knowledgeable. The chef himself kept assuring us we were getting our food rapidly after we stepped away from the counter.  The place was hopping!!  I zeroed in on the wood fired chicken arepas. These are chunky big servings and very tasty! My husband got the ribs with black beans and rice- and he was quiet for a long time, chowing down with pleasure. The seasoning is great!  I, a plantain fanatic, only saw the plantains after I ordered. Next time, for we shall return!!!",

    "text": "I like a good walk for comfort food. This place came up high on the list when I Yelped \"best cheap eats\".  3 mile walk from my hotel?  Hey, I needed the exercise.   The place is clean and spacious. Kinda Chipotlesque with the stainless steel countertops and serving trays.   The menu is clear and simple to navigate. Plenty of very tasty sounding items. I ordered a wood fired chicken arepas and a beef/black bean/plantain/cheese arepas.  And a cup of water.   The friendly folks called my name when it was ready. They serve it up with two squeeze bottles of their special sauces. One mostly white (garlic) and one kinda orangish (spicy).  As served, the arepas are not terribly big looking, but they are well-wrapped in paper and, as I would soon find out, surprisingly filling.    First thing I noticed--the damn things are HOT.  As in temperature. Not only could I not take a bite out of them--I couldn't even hold them. So...I let them cool a bit.   Finally (recall I just walked three miles to get there) I took my first bite. The corn masa (or whatever they make the arepas out of) was tender and moist. The chicken was shredded and juicy. The beef/bean/plantain/cheese was just the same--both really good. I loved the white sauce on both of them. This Venezuelan food reminds me a little of Cuban food--which I love.   A few quibbles... - no fountain sodas. And they charged me for WATER.  I get Las Vegas is running desperately low on the stuff, but most restaurants aren't that stingy. - no forks.  The arepas are messy after about three bites.  - kinda not cheap. Both my arepas and my water were $12 and change. That's not exactly \"cheap eats\" in my book.   That being said, I enjoyed the food and look forward to going back again. Even if I have to walk three miles. I appreciate the exercise.",

    "text": "I promise you that Viva Las Arepas is a little piece of heaven just on the outskirts of the city where you allow all your sins run free. In addition to mindless betting, grandeur casinos, and endless shopping boutiques, Las Vegas is about good eating, and there is a lot of it. I was feeling a little disinterested from fine dining everyday during my little Vegas weekend getaway so my date wanted me to try his cherished best kept secret in Las Vegas which is now one of my treasured eateries that I look forward to trying again upon my next visit.  Located just outside of The Strip near The Stratosphere, Viva Las Arepas wouldn't be noted to be in the prettiest part of the neighborhood. As well as the establishment is not the most elegant, the food was spectacular.  Without knowing exactly what an arepa was, I ordered the Reina Pepiada, a cold chicken salad covered in avocado and mayonnaise dressing whilst my date ordered a wood-fired chicken arepa. We added an additional cheese empanada for me, and a beef empanada for him since I have never had an empanada either.  Once our order was ready, my Reina Pepiada arepa reminded me of an overstuffed torta, but better! and once I tasted my arepa I knew this place was a special gem. The avocado mayonnaise sauce is really something that distinctively brought out the flavours. They also provide two bottles of their signature sauces; reach for the lighter green + garlic one, it is pure heaven, I wasn't shy to spread it all over my food.  The cheese empanada was still warm with gooey cheese. For just 3 dollars, this was delish! They also threw in a little extra extra for us; a sweet guava + cheese pastry, mm!  I cannot stop noting about Viva Las Arepas to my friends and other fellow Yelpers, this is one place not to be missed. I mean, if it wasn't for the cheese empanada order with the surprise sweet treat, I would order two of these on my next return x",

    "text": "I heard about this place through other Phoenix foodies, and they really delivered! We've only had arepas once before, but I continue to crave them because of this place.  We swung by Viva Las Arepas for a late Saturday lunch. My husband got three arepas: shredded chicken, the reina pepiada and the beef with tomato plus a side of fried plantains. I got the vegetarian arepa and a guava pastry. We loved our arepas. I usually hate plain food, but I would be very happy eating a plain arepa because the masa is so delicious. My husband said the reina pepiada was similar to a chicken salad as the filling was cold. We couldn't get enough of the spicy and cilantro sauces. The fried plantains were pretty good, but the guava pastry was a disappointment. I keep comparing the last two items to what I've had in Miami so I have high expectations.   We always drive when we go to Vegas so the location doesn't bother us. I'm sure we'll be back when we're in town to get these unique dishes.",

I've been eating arepas and cachapas for years having many Venezuelan friends, but in terms of restaurants, it's few and far between. Lucky for Las Vegas this gem of a restaurant is as good as it gets. The flavors were spot on and perfect in every way. I ordered the Reina Pepiada arepa along with a cachapa. Just the right temperature, just the right texture, just the right taste. I wanted to order more but simply didn't have room, so in the spirit of things I ordered another cachapa for the road. I look forward to going back, and bringing friends/family next time!",

    "text": "I give it a solid 3 1/2 stars.  I've had Viva Las Arepas on my radar for a while.  I just never get to visit this part of town all that often.  Since we went for a last hurrah at the Art of Flavors next door, we figure why not get an arepa to go as well?  Off to Viva Las Arepas we were!  Decor is nice inside, very spacious with another large outdoor veranda area.  It wasn't too busy on a Saturday night, only a few patrons on several of their tables.  But I did notice that the take out business was steady.  Lots of folks going in and out.  I was never familiar with arepas, all I knew was that they were a type of Venezuelan street food.  Any kind of street food sounds tasty to me!  Our cashier was gracious and asked us if we had been to Viva Las Arepas before.  We told him no so he proceeded to let us know what an arepa is and some of their most popular flavor combinations.  Basically, an arepa is a round patty made of cornmeal, grilled, then stuffed with various meats and cheeses.  Sold!  Had to try one (or two).  We ordered to go:  -Wood Fire Beef Arepa -Reina Pepiada Arepa (chicken breast, avocado, mayo & cilantro) -Fried Plantains  Waiting wasn't long, and before I knew it we were ready to go.  But, all our food came in one tiny plastic bag.  I was like, \"This all our order?  Salsa on the side too?\"  Dude was, \"Yep, you're all set.  Salsa in little containers, two each.\"  Really?  Bag wasn't that heavy at all.  Take it home and I'm already antsy for some grub 30 minutes later.  Open up the bag - one round Styrofoam container.  One long Styrofoam container.  Hmmm...am I missing an arepa?  Turns out, nope!  These arepa thingies are just a bit on the small side.  They really are.  Smaller than a sandwich, but bigger than a cookie.  What gives?  I felt like I was Godzilla with this little itty-bitty snack in my hand.  But, that morsel of arepa was pretty good!  I had the Reina Pepiada, arepa was still warm, crispy on the outside, but some good chew on the inside.  Chicken with avocado, mayo & cilantro made for a great filling.  Very tasty, and a good kick with their house green salsa.  Wifey liked the taste of her Wood Fire Beef arepa, goot hint of smoke with moist beef.  Fried plantains were good too, but that's really hard to mess up.  Overall, this was a good SNACK.  Guys my size would need two arepas to make a MEAL.  But, at around $5 a pop per arepa...for $10 you can go to the local Chinese buffet!  I liked Viva Las Arepas but not sure I would go out of my way that often to get it.  But the experience was good, and I would gladly have another arepa from there sometime down the line.  Perhaps they should have a food truck going around, too?  This is perfect food to sober up with!  Or down with a Corona!  How do you say \"ole\" in Venezuelan?  Good but pricey.",

    "text": "What a great introduction to Venezuelan food, outstandingly friendly cashier and delicious and reasonably priced.  The Arepa is their specialty. To me it was sort of the ingredients of a gourmet tamale in different proportions turned into a sandwich. Basically they make a  corn tortilla about 1/4\" thick, grill it up, then add your choice of several delicious fillings. They give a couple of types of sauces that can be used with it, they also are outstanding: a pepper sauce and a creamy muted garlic sauce. And the cutie at the counter also implored us to get the yucca fries, and holy moley was she spot on- they blew us away.  And they're open until midnight and have easy parking right in front, steps away. Had our meal in my hands within 5 minutes.  I'm gonna be seeking out more Venezuelan food in my life, this was hands down some of the best \"fast food\" I've ever had.   Thanks, viva las Apepas!!",

Located between downtown between the north strip ( stratosphere) and downtown  on the corner of oak and Las Vegas blvd, I noticed this place. Checked out the reviews and made the decision to check it out when my brunch plans got sidelined. It's located next to a gelato place ( yes there is an adult store, nail place and chapel but it's vegas-- I saw lots of kids eating here with familia  For a Sunday- lots of people ( in a good way) grubbing but not long of a wit for food or ordering. I was going to order the garlic shrimp and chicken but the gent at the register recommended #12 since it was my first time there..beef, black bean plantain and cheese. Both items I choose were $7, I got an order of fried plantain ($3) and an avocado upgrade ($1 big portion). I like it when people take pride in their food establishment to point people toward stellar items.  I had them place everything so I could eat on the patio-- great green salsa with a nice kick. Garlic shrimp was juicy so be warned because my shirt got hit.. -#12 was good too.  Totally full in a good way- much better choice then the buffet... :) on my face.The do have arepas that are $5 and vegetarian...so one could easily eat for $10 or less. I just wanted to try out more items.   My only problem was in my to go order they didn't give me napkins and forgot my avocado but that was a small glitch- just check your order :)",

In the time since I was last here, back in October of 2012, they have moved from the small mobile/portable building in Dino's parking lot to their own storefront in the strip mall on the next block to the south, on the same side of Las Vegas Blvd. Their shop is the southernmost storefront in the small strip mall (yes, there is off-the-street parking in the strip mall).  The food here is amazing. The selection of Venezualan food, and the quality, is simply great! Their new shop is brightly lit and colorfully decorated, and the food is just as good as it was when they were in their old location just north of here.  I particularly love their arepas, but then again I am an admited arepa addict.  The service is also very good; the staff is uniformly friendly and helpful. The prices are very reasonable, and the portion sizes are very generous. I can only assume that when various organized religions talk about the possibility of going to heaven after one dies, that they must be talking about going to this restaurant on a permanent basis, for there is nothing finer on earth!  It is no wonder that this restaurant has won several local awards for best of class/type, including the Best of Las Vegas (aka Best of Vegas) award for the Latin restaurant category!   Whenever I am in Las Vegas, I always visit this fine restaurant 2 or 3 times per week and stock up on arepas to stuff into the fridge in my hotel room!",

If I were to come back, I'd get the Pork Spare Rib meal. That was my favorite.        - Value - I think the price is a little high for what you're getting **Ordered**        - $22.99 Wood Fire Mix Grill w/ Fried Plantain & Fried Yucca Root - The pork spare ribs were delicous. Tender & tasty. The Beef was ok. However, the chicken was dry and the sausage wasn't very tasty.        - $4.50 Wood Fire Chicken Arepas - The chicken was dry. The arepas seemed to be more bun then anything else.        - $5.50 Wood Fire Beef Arepas - Bun, oil, and salty beef. Didn't really like the taste. **Recommendations**        - I'd wouldn't really recommend this place. There's a lot of other places you could get more bang for your buck.",

So first off, this place is North of the strip, in between Encore and the Stratosphere. The parking situation is a little lot or if that is filled, they have an empty lot in the back (super dingy at night). As for the decor, it is simple, nice, clean and spacious. The workers are friendly and they showed me the board with the arepas and the chef's recommendations. Each arepas is about the size of a small burger and they all cost about $7. We ended up getting:  Roasted Fire beef- Oh man, such a perfect blend. It's basically carne asada with a smoky flavor. Really good!  Chicken with avocado- A lot of people tend to order this so I gave it a try. The avocado, lime and cilantro blend very well together. It kind of makes it mushy to me. Overall, it was decent.  Roasted Fire chicken- The chicken was soft and tasty.  Passion Fruit juice- Yum! Sweet and tart! I love it!  Lastly, they take card and your food comes out pretty quick. Overall, my meal came out to $20 which is always nice in Vegas. I am a happy camper and I would love to come here again on my next trip.",

I ordered the wood fired chicken and beef arepas. The lady at the counter said the chicken was their most popular. So I took that one, and a beef one. After having both, I have to say I was much more impressed with the beef. It was tender, juicy and that creamy cilantro sauce (or atleast that's what I think it was) was impressive. I think that would go great on anything.  I am going back for the roasted pork butt arepa, and I am not sure, but I know for a fact I will be going here often. The meats were juicy and great flavor, but the real star was the actual arepa, it was dense but not dry, and had a great soft texture on the inside, but crunchy on the outside. if you had a pupusa before, it has that similar taste.  Love the vibe of the place, everyone was friendly, and it's just a great place to go and grab a bite to eat.",

Walked in at a great time. No line. I got what I gathered from yelp as the good and was not disappointed. That wood kissed beef if flavorful on it own but the give you sauce. I prefer hot.",

The Arepas looked small but  were quite filling for me. We enjoyed all items we ordered except fried bananas (they were very oily and mushy different from what I was expecting).  The service was also good. The person taking our order explained what the dishes were so we could make an informed order. If you are into trying different cuisines this one is definitely worth trying :D",

Wood Fired Beef Arepas ($5). Love the smokey flavor in the meat...it's delicious! I think their wood fired chicken and beef are my favorites here...chicken is a dollar cheaper.  Chicharron and Yuca Frita ($5.99). Delicious! Well done fried pork, with very flavorful fried yuca...imagine a very flavorful starchy french fry! Yummy   And the Reina Pepiada ($5): Chicken Breast, Avocado, Mayo and Cilantro.  This is delicious and works so well together.  I love pouring their hot sauce all over this beast!  And I ALWAYS finish up with Art of Flavors next door for dessert!  Even if you can't eat fresh homemade gelato, order a Spiced Hot Cocoa and you WILL thank me later :P  I will be back...many more times!  Pics :",

We ordered the shrimp and steak arepa and some \"french-fry like\" fried yukka root, since the guy at the register said they were the most popular. Mind you, I am a foodie at heart and this was my first time having Venezuelan food. Each arepa is about $7.00. The portion size was a lot smaller than they looked and I left feeling only semi-full. They are similar to pupusas.  Overall, good food but maybe I had high expectations that weren't exactly filled.",

That's double the prices the pictures are saying so you've been warned!   When you double your prices you got to do something different. Bigger sandwiches, something. These arepas are very good and a nice change from the usual Mexican food in LA, but it's not a good value. I would be perfectly happy paying $3, not the $6 I paid. The bread was clearly made fresh and it was good. The beef was very well seasoned. Unfortunately I wasn't satisfied. I would have been fine buying two for $6 but not 2 for $12. To be full you need 2 which makes the cost of these ridiculous!   No wonder why this very highly rated place had nobody in it. It seems as if they've passed on their added costs to the customers but that price hike scared everyone away. Amazing food or not I will not be back!!",

    "text": "Based on a recommendation from a coworker I was in the mood for something new and original yet tasty and fresh. Located in an innocuous spot 10 minutes from the strip in an older rundown area inside you'll find a cleanly decorated Venezuelan cafe. The decor is simple, lined with pictures that will impress you with the number of dishes you couldn't name. But in my opinion that's what makes it so exciting. Arepas is their signature food, \"arepas\" being a corn based flour that offers a huge variety of combinations of cheese and meats. Reina Pepiada is a mouthwatering blend of chicken and avocado and the corn based bread is such a great consistency and taste not overpowering and it's as soft as cornbread. They had freshly squeezed no sugar added juice as well as a desert of hot guava with cheese in a fried shell. For dessert right next door is a just as unique and tasty ice cream store with fresh and fun flavors using goat cheese and churros! All in all a great date spot that'll show how cultured and adventurous you are :)",

Anyway, after having spent quite a bit of time in Venezuela back in the mid 90's I was quite excited to try this. First impressions, when you walk in, it's clean, well lit, and has the outstanding smell of meat being smoked.  Menu is on a board and you walk up to order, very straight forward.  I ordered 2ea Pulled smoked chicken Arepas, and 2ea Beef empanadas, order of tostones, and fried Yuca.  I was so excited to take this home and share with my spouse since she has only heard me talk about it.  By the way staff are very pleasant and attentive, I watch as a gentlemen came out and was pulling finished platters from the tables, and the bathroom was clean.  My wife would have been impressed.  Got home and the meal was outstanding, just liked I remembered, the Arepas are big and stuffed full, one was enough for me along with the sides.  Empanadas were great along with the Yuca, and tostones.  This place has definitely earned and deserves its five stars.  While not on the best part of the strip, the parking lot right off the strip offers plenty of space and I could tell at night it would be very well lit.",

The menu has expanded but includes all of the old favorites. Definitely try the Arepas with wood fired beef as well as the roasted pork butt. Chicken is also a good standby. My wife is a fan of the bean and cheese empanadas. You can't go wrong ordering anything from their menu. The servings are a good size with plenty of meat, but the star of the show is the Arepa shell. Made from cornmeal, the shell is cooked crisp and cut open for stuffing. They are crunchy on the outside and very tender on the inside. Delish! All items are served with a cilantro sauce and a spicy sauce for those who like a little heat.",

Luckily I went with two friends so we were able to try a bunch of different things. We had the shredded beef arepa which is amazing.  We then shared the cheese empanada and the chicken empanada.  The cheese was my absolute favorite. Then we got the mixed Grill which had chicken beef sausage and pork ribs you get two sides with that. Let me tell you the sausage was the best I've ever had.

The owner, yes the owner himself, was everything but nice......very serious, not warm or kind at all, almost rude.  I thought it was very strange that an owner handled customers like this.   Then when we got out order, my arepa was the blandest I have ever tried! - even with all the filings!.  I ordered the wood fired chicken with cheese arepa, but honestly, it was not good at all.  The dough had no taste, the chicken didn't taste like wood fired chicken but like boiled black meat chiken, and only only one slice of cheese not even melted. This is the second time I go, and wanted to give it a chance bc I didn't like it the first time either, but I got convinced:  this is another of what I like to call a mediocre restaurant. Colombian arepas are a trillion times better! And Business Owner! - be more friendly! or don't deal with face to face customer service because it looked to me you have no social skills!, which is fine.....but then don't do it!",

The house specialty here are deceptively hearty sandwiches served in soft, creamy arepas - which are sort of like the love child of cornbread and bao. The meats grilled over wood - stacks of which are piled inside the restaurant - are imparted with a smoky flavor that perfectly complements the buns into which the meat is nestled. Be aware that these are pretty filling - the first time I was here I ordered two, with a side of rice and beans, and it was way too much food. These things are filling.",

The menu is a bit intimidating for a newbie, but the guy who work there are extraordinarily helpful and patient about explaining the offerings.  I completely enjoyed the cold shrimp item I had. While I was eating, they inquired to see if I was enjoying the food. This sort of service is more like a 1st class joint than a shack in a parking lot.  People were constantly showing up, but there was never a line. The food has to be prepared, so while it's not fast, it still gets to you fairly promptly.   I brought my wife on a return visit a couple of days later and had the same excellent and enjoyable experience. A must-stop from now on when I'm in Vegas.",

Our small family of four ordered the MIX plate which consisted of 3-4 different types of grilled meat. It was all very tasty and tender. Fall off the bone ribs, grilled steak, grilled chicken and sausage. That was pricey 23.99 but we all were able to indulge in the meat fest to our hearts content!   For the side I ordered salad and plantains. I have never really tried real authentic plantains and these were pretty good. A lil too sweet for the rest of the meal. We are about half of them. The salad it was a big plate of iceberg lettuce and tomatoes with a dressing. We didn't really care for that. We also ordered their carne asada arepa. Soooo good we couldn't get enough. A couple chicken and beef empanadas rounded out the meal for the kids. All in all we were so impressed we are def going back during our two week Vegas stay!!",

On corner of Oakley*  The restaurant is big and tons of space to sit.. Wasnt busy when I came through.  I order the woods-fire chicken arepas with cheese and avocado and a side of fried yucca root and pork.  First time trying arepas but it tasted like tomale due to the fact they used corn as the bread... And came with shredded chicken.   Overall I was satisfied with the arepas but Its a bit pricy for just this.. 4.99 for a small bite with no side.  The yucca root and pork was good but hey fried yucca root taste like fries with a bit texture difference, and the fried pork was flavorful.  This is a good place to stop by for a small bite :D some come try it out :D",

The place is very unassuming from the outside, i have actually passed by this area multiple times before and I never noticed it. Inside, I was surprised by how spacious it was.   I ordered the reina pepiada (chicken w mayo and avocado) and fries on the side, and it was delicious! It's like a burger, almost, except its made of thick flour bread (like tortilla, just a lot thicker and meatier). It was delicious and i will be back.",

    "text": "July 2011  Never heard of Arepas?  You aren't alone.  This was a Yelp find by my girlfriend and we just had to try it.   Pros:  +  i Love Arepas !  + Open late  + Friendly staff  + Awesome Hot sauce  Cons:   -  N/A    Overall:   I'm not a Venezuelan expert or anything, but the easiest way to describe it is a Venezuelan version of a taco.  I don't really know how else to explain it ha.  You just gotta try it for yourself!  I'm sure you won't be disappointed.  This place is addicting.  I personally loved the Lengua Arepa... Tongue for those who do not know.  It's located on the north end of the strip.  It's just a little stand with a few tables for seating, but don't judge the book by its' cover.  This was a pleasant surprise!  Next time I go, I'm going to try one of their Fruit Juices... I hear they are pretty good.  Tips:  -  I didn't know how filling 1 Arepa was.  I ordered 3 Arepas thinking it was equivalent of 3 tacos at say Don Tortacos, but I was wrong.  Arepas are a lot heavier than a taco.  I'd say 2 and your good to go.  -  If you like spicy hot... try their hot sauce.  It has a good kick to it.  -  Don't forget to grab some extra napkins... you're gonna need it.  -  They take card so don't worry if you don't have cash.",

    "text": "This place is fantastically close to the Stratosphere, making it easy for me to justify running over for a quick lunch. This has allowed me to sample a large portion of their arepa offerings, usually by ordering two at a time; one to devour sitting at their stand & generously doused with their delicious sauces and one to go, for when the first digests enough to make room for it. This means I usually order one of their hot ones (for now) and the cold (for later); the Pork Butt and Tongue are my fave for the hot while the Reina & Garlic Shrimp are both boss for cold.   The Pork Butt is a winner. If you like pork, get it. Rich, tender chunks of flavorful pork drenched in juices? Yeah, it's even better with avocado.  I really enjoyed the Tongue arepa, too. The beef is tender, there were decently sized chunks of tomato and aromatics all nestled between those little golden cakes of fluffy/crunchy delight.  If you like chicken salad, the Reina is a tasty Venezuelan version wedged between the delicious griddle-fried masa cakes.  The garlic shrimp were a decent portion of shrimp in a buttery garlic sauce that soaks into the bread the longer it sits.   Even the cold codfish is pretty good. They mix the cooked fish with a flavorful blend of seasonings and veggies/aromatics. It doesn't overwhelm with the stank o' fishiness, but you still know it's there.  They also offer a few other things, but I always grab an arepa.  I'll diversify once I've conquered their entire Arepa menu!",

This is Viva Las Arepas all the way!  I don't know how they do it, but everything I've ever had here is amazing. The only problem is that I struggle to order anything new since what I've had before is already so hard to choose from.   The fries and black beans are really great, and they offer generous portions of each for only $3, great for sharing.  The Arepas of course are the specialty, but I don't think I've seen an entree there that didn't look great.  Unfortunately, the location is a little bit sketchy for some, but I look at it as their loss. Yes, it's not the nicest area of Las Vegas, but it is right near downtown and a convenient stop before heading to any of the uber-trendy bars in the area.  Priced for lunch, Viva Las Arepas might be the best value for food in all of Las Vegas. I don't know anywhere else that offers so much fresh, amazing food for under $10.",

No bathrooms & no free tap water, so you'll BYO Drink or pay $1 for a drink.

I am glad I did.... The place is small, but seems pretty clean. It was definitely crowded at lunch time. The service was excellent as the woman taking my order was helpful and the woman who brought me my to-go order made sure we had all we needed.  The only thing was while waiting for the to-go order I felt I was in the way.  The food was great. I got the shredded chicken arepa and it was great... The melted cheese with tomato and all was great. I also picked up a pork butt arepa, carne asada arepa and a shredded beef empanada. They were all good with the carne asada chopped up for all the flavor but our favorite of the three was the pork butt as packed full of spices!  We were both very full and thoroughly enjoyed the meal! Glad I ventured",

The beef one was more flavorful, tasted like sloppy joes almost. The chicken was a little bit dry but that special green sauce fixed that. We also ordered one beef and one chicken empanada. The empanadas felt too doughy and barely had any meat. They were like plain, less meaty versions of the arepas.   Fried plaintains were good though. Oily, hot and satisfying. Also had their sugar cane juice with lime. I didn't like that at all.  Minus another star for skimpy meat filled empanadas and the sour drink.",

Got the chicken & beef arepas. It was a small portion, but really stuffed with the meat, seems a bit overpriced for $3.50  I only ate half of each, it did have flavor, but it felt rather bland, it tasted like a mix of a packet of taco seasoning with some enchilada sauce.

In the hallway that runs beside the kitchen is stacked wood that they use to grill the chicken, and when you taste the chicken you are instantly knocked out by that amazing smokey flavor. It's a marvel of simple, perfect, pure flavor. The arepas themselves are equally great, especially the pork and chicken (IMHO). Be careful though. You will think you need to order two or three because they are so cheap, but you won't be able to finish even a second. They are STUFFED with ingredients, and the masa-based dough is mighty heavy. These are gut bombs of the highest order. You'll be hard pressed to find a greater value anywhere. Food this impeccable should not be this cheap.",

I am in no way shape or form an expert on the food of Venezuela, but I know delish when I taste it, and there are some mighty fine treats coming out of this window. I sampled strictly the Arepas. What the heck is an Arepa? Kind of a grilled corn shell, like a mash up of a sope and papusa, but hand sliced down the middle like a hamburger bun. After that just pick the  filling(s) you want and enjoy. I particularly like the black bean and cheese and the tongue. Perico is the kitchen sink and really good too. Don't forget that crazy good green sauce, don't worry, it's not hot, but does burst with flavor. Arepas run $2.75-$4.00 Empanadas are $1.99 Venezy drinks are $1.49-dude hooked me up with free refills, don't know if that's the norm though. I tried 2 beverages Parchita which is a very sweet fruit punch thing, and the star by far was the Guanabana drink, which comes from the native southern hemisphere fruit of the same name. Very light, clean and refreshing taste. Bonus, they claim only fresh ingredients and no MSG, no microwave, and no can openers.",

    "text": "Finally got a chance to try this place for a gigantic dinner. Recently visited Goodwich and Art of Flavors in the same plaza, and knew it wouldn't be long til I'd be downing arepas, too...  Scouted out the menu online, cross referencing it with reviews here, and ultimately decided on the #1: shredded beef and the #7: reina pepiada, plus a side of fried yucca. Total came to just over $15, which was a bit pricey IMO.  The arepas were unique and tasty, but fell a little short of my expectations. The shredded beef was a little on the dry side, but I perked it up with a bunch of the creamy cilantro sauce- that stuff is the bomb dot com. The reina pepiada arepa was tasty too, but the flavor simply got boring after a few bites.  Luckily, the yucca was there to save the day: crispy and chewy and garlicky, it's everything yucca is supposed to be! The $3 price tag was a bit steep for the 12 bits that I got, most of which were half-pieces. Would I get them again though? Resounding yes.  Service was okay: minimal but friendly, brought out my take out to me at a table and took my order efficiently. Decor in the restaurant is fairly typical for a taqueria, but with the added touch of local artwork on the right hand wall as you walk in, all available for purchase. Though the pieces were good and added to the ambiance of the restaurant itself, I'm again taken by the sticker shock- the two paintings closest to me were $110 and $380. For folks advertising inside of a restaurant, that seems a bit unrealistic, but what do I know.  Might come back and try a few different flavors, seems like the BF and I could share three- they look deceptively small but they're very filling. But I'll definitely be adding on the yucca.  Side note: though a lot of other reviews mention the lengua arepas, and they look AMAZING, they no longer carry lengua here. So sad about that! :(",

Viva Las Arepas serves authentic Venezuelan food in a fast food like environment.   I came here with two of my classmates and we almost sampled every item on the menu. I personally ordered the garlic shrimp arepa; tequenes pastelitos; fried plantains; cheese empanada; and a mango beverage. The tequenes was the worst of them all; which contained an uncooked cheese stick in the middle. The arepa contained baby sized shrimp and was too fishy for my taste. The cheese empanada was tasty and the cheese was actually melted; mango beverage way too sweet; and the plantains while having a nice flavor were extremely greasy. The overall consensus on the food was that everything was too greasy.   I wish I was more a fan of the food here because it's right around the corner from my house and the owner Felix is a good man.",

Portions are good even though they look small. All were small in size but were packed with a ton of meat and are pretty heavy. A few of us ordered 2 because the arepas looked smallish in size, but  could barely take a bite out of their second one.   Minus 1 star because the meats needed a little more flavor/seasoning/spices. We were glad that they had the two sauce options but both were incredibly mild and we really needed a spicy sauce to round out the arepas.",

Unless you are starving or can eat like a trucker, you will likely only be able to eat one of these beauties.  Which makes it a full meal for around $4.  Yay!  They also gave me cold green salsa and ranch dressing (at least I think it was ranch dressing) that went so perfectly with my hot sandwich of the gods.  Not really thrilled about eating out in a parking lot.  The nearby pedestrians were a little shady and made me a tad nervous.  But take out seemed easy and probably the better option.  I just hope they expand, maybe to Naked City Sandwich Shop's old location.  They have their sign up there already.  Just take over the space.",

    "text": "Let me just start this review with the fact that I am OBSESSED with arepas.  I first tried this glorious gift to mankind in Providence, Rhode Island, of all places. It was the little mom and pop where the owners obviously just moved from Venezuela. Anyway, fast forward 3 years and I've tried to find arepas wherever I go. I've tried Caracas Arepa bar in NY and was not impressed. Closer to home, I've had Coupa Cafe in Beverly Hills, which is okay and Cafe Bolivar in Santa Monica (which is really really good).   Now, for Viva Las Arepas. I saw it as I was driving to North Vegas and immediately pulled a U-turn to grab me some arepas. I ordered the pork arepa with cheese and it was really really good! Their guasacaca (green sauce) was really good.   On my last trip to Vegas I had to come back. They did a whole overhaul on this place. It looks much nicer than it used to. So I ordered the pork arepa again. This time, the sauce it came with was either the spicy sauce or some white \"cilantro\" sauce. It was not the same guasacaca I had become accustomed to. The spicy sauce was good, but I think that the white sauce was too creamy. Bring back your old sauce!!!!  Overall, it's still very good in terms of arepas. The meat is tender and well seasoned. The arepas are obviously freshly home made and they have a nice crust to them. I will have to come back on every pilgrimage to Vegas =)  Other things to note: There is a parking lot and outdoor seating. Prices are pretty good. One arepa will fill you up. I've also had the fried yucca and the plantains; both are good!",

The type of place I'll lay in bed and think about.  Arepa's are packed with the most incredibly flavored meat you'll ever have the privelage of lodging in to your gullet. Wood fired is king. Arepas is king of wood fire. Arepas is the emporer of food.  Enough about the Arepas. Let's talk about Cachapa. More travelled people have already heard of this food.

    "text": "This is a late review but its better late than never.  My friend and I was so excited hearing about this restaurant that we had to try out the Chef's choice Arepas of the shredded beef and chicken.  We also then tried their dessert pastries of the guava and cheese. Then the fresh squeezed mango juice while he had a soda to wash away the goodness.  They were very clean and organized when we came in after the lunch hour.    The filling was way more than we thought packed into a small pocket of corn cake patties. We were actually full after eating and had to wait a while to eat our dessert pastries.  I wish there were seconds on the drinks! The fresh juices were soo good! All in all, a great food experience and such a great price.  And if you are coming from late night sight seeing or bar hopping its open until 12am!  Its a must go eat and right off of the Stratosphere.",

    "text": "Stop what you are doing and go get an Arepa at Viva Las Arepas now, and thank me later.   I live 30 minutes away from this place, it's on the strip, and I have driven there three times in the past three weeks to sample more of their delicious Venezuelan morsels.   The food is out of control. If you've never had an Arepa, it is a Venezuelan take on the taco. The key here is that the shell is a pillowy flatbread. That bread wraps around some of the most flavorful, tender and mind-blowing meats I have ever sampled. My two favorites are the #1 (wood-fired beef) and the #7 (Reina pepiada... A chicken salad). The beef is cooked perfectly and the spices are just right. And in case they are not flavorful enough, you can Doctor them up with their spicy green pepper sauce or a creamy avocado sauce. Honestly, the #1 is just right for me but occasionally I'll take a bit of the sauces because they are really good.   I loved the ribs. They had a good crispy skin but they were falling off the bone. The empanadas are a great accompaniment to whatever arepa you choose. And don't skip dessert. They have pastelitos in two flavors. One is guava and cheese and the other is coconut. I'm not a huge guava fan but the coconut one was ridiculous.   So far, I have been with my wife on a date, once with our three kids and once with a few friends. It was a great spot for all three outings. It's casual, and you don't have to worry if your group is a little rowdy. It is on the strip but it's north of Sahara so it's not crazy busy and there is parking all around the building.",

The only vegetable was a thin slice of tomato. I did see that the avocado arepa had more vegetables, so maybe I just chose poorly.  The bun itself was a bit soggy ~ I would have liked it a bit crispier. So overall, the food was just a mediocre experience.  I will say however that the staff were very friendly and authentically from Venezuela, so much so that I feel a bit bad giving a 3 star review.",

The gentleman who took my order was really friendly and answered my questions about the drinks.    I ordered a Reina Pepiada, an arepa made with shredded chicken breast, avocado, mayo, and cilantro.  I also got a coconut and cheese pastelito for a dessert.  For my drink, I had asked the clerk about the Malta Polar, a Venezuelan soda, made with molasses instead of sugar.  He said he liked it and I gave it a try.  It was tasty--a bit strong--but it was curiously refreshing.  Wait, that one's taken!  It was very good and it was a good accompaniment for lunch.  When he brought my food, he also brought the three squeeze bottles of sauces.  The red bottle--this is a nice spicy sauce that gave the arepas some kick.  The yellow bottle had a spicy cilantro sauce and this too had a kick.  The white bottle had the mild sauce, but it was OK.  I tried it and then went back to the premium grades.  Coconut and cheese seemed an odd combination to me, but I love coconut, so I had to give this a go.  What a pleasant treat!  The cheese mixed with the coconut had a symbiotic relationship and they went well together.  I guess I'll just have to make it a more common experience to drive the few miles from my car dealership after service and have lunch here!  Viva Las Arepas and Viva Las Vegas!",

The chicken thighs were over cooked but if they hadn't I suspect they would be unbelievable. Same goes for spareribs I ordered but a few of them were spot on and meat fell off the bone. ( yum )  The interior is nothing to be excited about, it's just a run down diner kinda. But I'm sure in time things will improve but I'd say try coming in and sample a few things.

    "text": "NO LATIN TRANSLATOR NECESSARY!  It seems like everytime I go to any Latin restaurant, I need a real live Rosetta Stone for any questions I have. Either that or I need subtitles when an employee talks to me. LOL.  Anyways, back to my review. I have heard good things about this place from all my Yelp buddies so that alone is good motivation. I have heard of arepas but never actually had them. For those noobs like me, its a dish made of ground corn dough or cooked flour, very prominent in the cuisine of Colombia and Venezuela. So you can put two of them together with your choice of meat and other toppings. I ordered carne asada with cheese. I scarfed it down like a it was the last piece of food I will ever see again. They have other delectable choices as well but when you go to a highly recommened place, you get what is popular so their namesake lived up to the hype.  Service is awesome! They answer all the questions you have and even make suggestions based on what you are leaning towards. They bring it out to you where you sit with two ketchup bottles. One has a light green colored kind of sauce and the other has a light reddish tint to it. Both have different spices to it but the reddish colored one has a little kick to it. Not overpowering, but definitely gives your food that extra oomph that keeps your mouth watering.  As for their location, they used to be half a block up the street in a little taco stand. They are now on the corner of Oakey and S Las Vegas Blvd, just kitty corner to 7/11. Look for the weird Indian statues because they are neighbors with an Indian antique store.  I guess with their recent popularity, they moved to this spacious building. They have plenty of tables and chairs so bring your friends. Plenty of room.  The only negative things I can see is that the parking is kind of limited. The old Indian statues take up several parking stalls and the stalls are small to begin with so be real careful in parking and backing up. Also they charge 50 cents for using cards to pay for anything under 10 dollars.   So if I ever make a trip to South America, at least I know what and how good arepas are. VIVA LAS AREPAS!",

    "text": "I didn't know what to really expect when I first came in, a lot of Yelpers had been commenting that VLA had changed since they got more popular. Jacked up prices and less meat, I started to regret not visiting them when they were still in their shack.   A friend paid me a visit at work so that we could go out for lunch, we had both never tried VLA so we decided to try it out. Walking in I looked at the menu and prices and wow, talk about over priced. On top of that, they charge you extra for the cheese which arepas normally have, so that felt like a rip off, that's like ordering a cheeseburger but you have to pay extra for the cheese, but I get it, they're trying to make money. I ended up ordering two arepas, a reina pepiada and carne asada, I also got a coke, my total, over $13 for such a small meal, the arepas are about the size of grocery store hamburger buns, so they're a bit on the small side.The cashier was very nice and helpful, my friend didn't understand what some things meant and she explained them to her.   We didn't wait very long for our food to come out, maybe about 10 minutes tops. I first bit into the reina pepiada and it was really good, but after a few bites I was over the sauce which is made with avocados and cilantro. The carne asada was my favorite, the meat was finely chopped and it came with one leaf of lettuce and one sliced tomato, but the heat of the carne asada cooked the tomato so I picked it out, yuck. One thing I can't stomach is cooked tomatoes so next time I know to order it without it. Both arepas came with a decent amount of meat and both were flavorful as well. I loved their green salsa, it had the perfect amount of kick.   Overall, I enjoyed my meal, price, not so much, but I will be back because they know how to make some pretty tasty arepas.",

I've tried the shredded beef, shredded chicken and roasted pork butt arepas. If you order one arepa, it's a nice snack but ordering two is like having a full meal. Everything on the menu is delicious and you can't go wrong. My mouth is salivating just thinking about it. I also had the sugar cane drink which transports me to a time when I was a small child chewing on fresh sugar cane stalks! If I lived closer, I would eat here more often. I really do love arepas.",

Meat to dough ratio was a little off.. there was hardly anything inside the empanadas.. and the person that was supposed to take my order just stared at me for a good 10 seconds.. and thats pretty long in staring time!  The Garlic Shrimp stood out from the rest in taste and quality but I just wasn't really a fan of the dough.  Just a little too.. doughish I guess?  I would much rather smother myself with one of 'em cheesy soft tacos at one of 'em spanish carts at one of 'em gasoline stations or one 'em tire repair shops.

After my friend (who also works as a chef in the Comme Ca in vegas) told me to come here, I decided to give this place a try after one drunken night of drinking a bit too much of Mrs.Belvedere (Grey goose ftw).    Buy anywayz, I was DEFINITELY blown out of the sky with their Shredded Beef arepa.  It was f'in money (substitude \"f\" for watever you want).  Although I've never had an arepa, I DO know what good food is all about.  This place just hits a sweet spot that's so sweet, that your sweetness will die of being sweet.  I would never imagine myself giving a little food stand 5 stars, but I have no choice.    If you are looking for some drunk food in vegas, look no further.  In fact, you don't even have to be drunk to enjoy this place.  Just come here and enjoy a fantastic Venezuelan arepa.  Oh, and I also had the chance to take a bite of the empanada...fried to perfection.  For hangover pre-medication, try the sugar cane juice with lime.  For $1.50, you can't go wrong.  I was a little confused on how to get here (drunk, but I wasn't driving fyi), but coming from Las Vegas Blvd, head past the Stratosphere and stay on your right as you come to a fork.  You'll see it a block ahead.  This place closed at 12am.",

    "text": "I finally got to try this place! I know of it's rave Yelp reviews and was excited to try it when I saw it offering a certificate on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a>. I put the address without the suite # and was routed to the wrong place by Maps, but the Yelp app saved the day. It's next to a gelato shop & some trashy club wear place. Very sketchy with a couple homeless people, including a man in a wheelchair offering my husband $1 for 2 cigaettes. Unfortunately, my husband had to tell him it was a vape and not a cigarette.   The restaurant itself was very clean and happy with its yellow walls. The employees were all very helpful. We ordered quite a bit of items and there were no problems accepting our certificate. We sat and the owner brought our order out to us directly.   We had: Wood fire beef with cheese: 5 stars. This was our favorite! Very flavorful beef with stringy cheese, tomato, and lettuce.   Pulled pork with cheese: 4 stars. Juicy pulled pork that tasted smokey and tender. My issue with the arepas that I received was that not all the shell things were toasted equally. Some were crispy and would hold up and be buttery deliciousness. Others were more soft, but ended up becoming soggy and tasting like a mushy corn texture.   Reina pepiada: 4 stars. It is an avocado chicken salad. It was yummy although missing some texture.  Garlic shrimp: 2 stars. This was my least favorite by far. The arepa for this one seemed very corn mealy? It wasn't toasted very much and got soggy quick. The shrimp are tiny little guys that you'd probably find at red lobster in their pasta. Also, pretty bland.   Grilled chicken empanada: 2 stars. I've had empanadas made by my friends from Argentina, and it's all about the shell thing. This one was super thick! It was like eating an arepa with only a little bit of filling. Just way too carby for me. The grilled chicken in it was yummy though! I'd like to try it in an arepa next time.   Fried plantains: 3 stars. Not my cup of tea. Kind of slimy in texture. If they were fried in oil, I couldn't tell because there was no crisp, but because they are called fried plantains, I will assume they were doused in oil, which make it not worth the calories.   Guava & cheese thing: 4 stars. Way better shell than the empanada and yummy guava with cheese. I wish the cheese was more melted but when I bit into it, it still looked like a solid block.   Overall, I would stop by again if I'm in the neighborhood. Perhaps I'd ask for the arepa extra toasted just to make sure there aren't any soggy ones. I definitely want to try to the grilled chicken. I appreciate this small business and the love the put into their food. I fortunately, there were just some issues I couldn't overlook. Until next time!",

My favorite was the tequenos,fried cheese surrounded by crispy dough. The arepas are good, generous in the fillings,  but unfortunately, I was dissapointed  with the carne mechada, it was lacking that authentic flavor I'm used to, to me it was lacking in flavor, maybe  it needs some more cumin, garlic, and red peppers and onions, it didn't have any visible strips of onions and peppers that is traditional in venezuelan carne mechada. Also the cheese in the arepas looked like mozzarella, not the traditional queso fresco. Overall, I think this place is good and I would go back to try some of the other things they offer.",

Nothing fancy, just solid, fresh food.  Tried the Reina Pepiada (a chilled chicken salad - chicken breast,mayo, avocado, cilantro) - excellent.  An Arepa is a small flattened disc of white corn flour that is grilled at then split and filled with a variety of fillings.  They also sell whole and half chickens grilled over mesquite wood.  Everything is fresh.  The empanadas are delicious as well.  Average price for an Arepa is $4 - $6.  Empanadas are $3.  The place is kept clean.  Well worth the trip.",

Since moving to LA years ago, this was my first west coast experience while visiting Vegas and LOVED it. They're so much better than the plain cheese ones I used to get growing up. There's a lot of vegetarian flavor options and yummy side dishes to add. The staff was cracking up at my excitement seeing the menu and was really great helping my friends choose what to eat. I'm adding this place to my regular stops when I visit Vegas every few months. :)",

The only thing is the tostones are okay they could be thinner and more crisp in my opinion. I'm puerto Rican and thats how I'm use to it. Aside from that Its perfect and we will always come back!",

Don't forget to try the ribs, I mean fall off the bone. Oh, I almost forgot the plantains were like little sweets fried pockets.

Located right outside of Dino's, they are a must before, or after getting a little tipsy.  I had originally wanted to get the tongue, but they ran out. Instead, the chef suggested the leg meat and I have to bow down to the tender and flavorful meat. Cut off in thick gyro like pieces, this could be deadly. The rest of the group ordered and we had this meal family style. The garlic shrimp were tender and juicy. There is nothing worst than ordering shrimp and getting rubber instead. So good we order three. The pork butt was also delicious. The pulled chicken, mayo, and avocado arepa was so rich and decadent. The combination was perfection, but not for more than a few bites. I was glad to be able to pass it on after a bite. We had also ordered the cod and that was not a hit. For being a mild fish, it had an overbearing flavor. It was extremely salty and was the last to be finished.",

Having said that, I think the food is as delicious as ever. Even if Felix isn't making the stuff himself, he runs a tight ship, and the quality is maintained. I think it's the best tasting, and certainly one of the most interesting, restaurants of its category!  Be sure to check it out and experience it for yourself!

My best friend also ordered the beef arepa since he's just loves beef. The chicken arepa was good, the pork butt was better but the bites my friend gave me from his wood fire beef arepa were the absolute best. Everything was flavorful and tasty.

We got a couple and things and split it all like tapas.   That's good the people here are amazing, super friendly and you can tell they put a lotta love and what they do. It's really rare to find in a place like Las Vegas.

My favorite are the roast pork butt arepas, as well as the wood fire beef arepas. And yes, they cook everything on  real wood.    The restaurant is so clean that you can eat off the floor. I'm not kidding. The floor is a well polished tile floor, with all wood furnishings and beautiful light fixtures. Honestly, you can find a restaurant like this in a high end resort.   The business owner, Felix takes incredible pride in his food. Everything is made in order, in house. All the beans, meats, and rice are made in house. Every other place uses refried beans and frozen meats. Never have I been to such a great restaurant where the employees love what they do, and the owner personally remembers you.   In all honestly. I name this restaurant the best Hispanic food in Las Vegas. More importantly I rate this restaurant as one of the best places I have ever eaten in. I want to personally thank Felix for providing such a authentic, and quality dining experience in my office.",

I didn't know that the Reina pepiada was a cold arepa which was a little dissapointing to me since the last time I had one, it was a hot arepa. Still great tasting, just off to me because of the cold/hot thing. A little pricey for arepas but this is on the strip so that's probably why. Small seating area but even if I had to take it to go I would !",

I ordered the shredded pork butt and beef arepa, and the fried plantains. The arepa bread itself was a bit mushy. The outside shell was crispier and better. For those who have never had an arepa, it is a lot like a gordita. I'm not talking about the gorditas they serve at Taco Bell, I'm talking about the authentic ones.   Beef arepa: good, but a bit greasy  Pork butt arepa: the pork was tasty  Fried plantains: nice and warm, but a bit greasy  While I'm not looking for healthy foods here, it could have been a little less greasy.  Pros:  -good hours (open from 8 a.m. to midnight, daily) -the guy was super helpful and friendly when I told him it was my first time.  -the food was fine, but not super good.  Cons: -a bit greasy -hot sauce weren't so good -the arepa bread, a bit mushy -small parking lot",

    "text": "I haven't reviewed Viva Las Arepas yet?! Best fix that.   Viva Las Arepas is worth a trip whether you're familiar with the Venezuelan wonder food or have never tried these meat-filled Joy Pockets. It's representative of the best the genre has to offer; the arepa itself is fluffy and moist, and the meat inside is fresh, flavorful, and sooooo juicy. The meat is all cooked over a wood fire, and the flavor they get out of the meat is just incredible. The woodfired beef, and the reina pepiada (chicken with peas and avocado and...um...stuff?)  have become my go-to favorites, and I've developed cravings for the reina. So good.   I'm pretty sure this place was the former occupant of the current Goodwich Cube outside of Dinos, but it has moved waaaaay up in the world, and now has a clean, classy restaurant with a great patio and a ton of seating just across the street, in a lot with a kitsch shop, a lingerie store, and a Bail Bondsman. Ahhhhhh Vegas.  Pros: - Holy cow the food is delicious. Get two; an old favorite and then try something new. I've never had anything bad there. - The arepas themselves are perfect. I've had arepas at other places that get this weird \"cheap poorly made cornbread\" texture to them that is not at all pleasant. That is not the case here. Something like a cross between a crumpet and a tortilla, I imagine the manna God sent from heaven was actually arepas. - Sauces. They come in two generous tubes; one's spicy, one's garlicky. Yellow bottle. Do yourself a favor and just slather that on. - This is fast lunch food that's not at all fast food. Takes about 5-10 minutes from order to eating, depending on how busy they are. Unless you order the All The Meats plate, which takes a while, and feeds 3.  - VERY affordable. You can eat a lunch that will make you full for dinner for about $12.  - Seating for 2-14 comfortably.  Cons: - The other businesses in the strip mall give me the giggles. - You will want to eat ALL THE AREPAS, all the time, which will make you very fat.",

I like to add the two sauces to mine. There's a creamy sauce its almost like a creamy cilantro sauce and a hot sauce. I've also had the shredded beef empanadas.. they are small, soft and a little sweet. The prices are good you could probably get a Arepa and a drink for $10 or less.",

The plantains are also about the best you can get. Order them \"Con Crema\" (with creme). It is somewhere between cream cheese and sour creme. It is fantastic with the sweetness of the cooked plantains.  Yeah, it's in a slightly sketchy part of town - but the upside is that the people-watching is fantastic. Perfectly safe during the day. Standard urban-awareness practices at night.   ...and as others have mentioned, it's just across the street from Luv-It frozen custard - a Las Vegas institution that somehow the tourists seem to miss entirely.   Definitely a great place to go if you're in this part of town - and worth a drive here if you're looking for something tasty and different.",

    "text": "Checked this place out today, while it was 110+ degrees out, and they had no A/C running! If they did, you definitely could not feel it because it was just as warm inside as it was outside.   On to the food - we ordered the #1 carne asada, #2 wood fired chicken, and #4 pork butt arepas. When you get your food, they provide 2 sauces - a creamy, cilantro-ish (similar to the creamy cilantro dressing from El Pollo Loco) and a salsa verde that has a little bit of a spicy kick to it. Both sauces had great flavor, and thank goodness they did because you'll need it. I've never had arepas before so I'm not sure if they're meant to be bland so it'll pick up flavors from the meat, but they were just that. Unfortunately, the meats didn't really help either because they were pretty flavorless, too. The carne asada arepa was so dry that I had to douse it in the green sauces just to get through it and still didn't finish it. The pork butt had some type of sweet tomato based sauce on it, sort of tasted like al pastor. It was just ok, definitely not as dry as the asada. I didn't try the chicken arepa but my BF said it was just ok.   We also ordered the 3 chicken thighs special that's posted on the window by the register and an order of yucca fries. I love yucca fries and these were just right. Crunchy on the outside, smooth inside. The chicken thighs special came with 3 pieces of grilled boneless, skinless thighs, black beans, and rice. I would come back here just for the beans and rice! Whatever flavor was lacking in the arepas was totally made up for in the rice and beans. Definitely worth a try.   Overall, I'm not completely in love with the place but they have a lot of other items on the menu that seemed interesting. Might give it another shot some day.",

Don't want an Arepa, that's fine, have some chicken, or a salad. They do have Vegetarian options.   Everything is reasonably priced and well worth it. You will leave satisfied.

The filling is so flavorful & the bun (sorry i know it's not called that, its like made out of corn or something right?) is delicious! When you bite into it the bun part is a bit crispy & then the filling is juicy, meaty, & saucy!  Also, they gave you some sauces on the side to eat with it. I'm not exactly sure what kind of sauce it is but it seriously compliments the Arepa!  The green sauce is uh-mazing!   I wish it were a bit cheaper, but you can't beat the flavor & taste.   10/10 would recommend!! :-)",

The lady that rang us up was super friendly and patient with us as we were not too familiar with the menu.  I got the carne asada and jamon y queso (ham & cheese) arepas with a guava and cheese pastelito for dessert and the passionfruit drink.  First off, these arepas are HUGE. I eat a lot, and 1 1/2 of these bad boys sure filled me up.  They're not skimpy on the fillings at all. It may not look like it at first glance, but these arepas are STUFFED to the brim. The carne asada was seasoned well, and there was this melty, gooey cheese literally spilling out of my ham and cheese arepa. My boyfriend gave me a bite of his Reina Pepiada and I really digged the avocado and cilantro sauce that it was cooked in.  I was a bit confused on the guava and cheese pastelito as they put a piece of actual cheese (think of almost like a squeaky mozarella cheese curd) needless to say, I was expecting cream cheese like they serve in Miami. But I'm familiar with cheese being dessert so it was interesting.  Whenever Im back in Vegas I will make sure to come back, so happy to have stumbled on this place!",

Husband had an hallaca, the domino arepa (beans and cheese) and a parchita drink. My favorite part was the smoky flavor on the chicken; it added a nice twist to the reina pepiada, which is ordinarily kind of bland. Oh, and taquenos. We had one of those too. Honestly, the taquenos were the best I've ever had. Soft and the dough was slightly sweet. Yummy! It sounds like a lot of food - it was, but hubs is Venezuelan and wanted to try everything. Also had a nice conversation with the owner.",

Then again, when I think about the 4 we got, it'd be hard to choose 3 of the 4. They were all delicious! We got 4 of the ones marked as \"chef's special\": wood fire beef, wood fire chicken shredded, reina pepiada (chicken with avocado, mayo, and cilantro), and pabellon (plantains, cheese, black beans, beef). Seriously, delicious. Hard to choose a favorite; each were distinct with rich flavors. The reina pepiada was very unique, so I'd definitely suggest getting that.  Prices range from $5-$7 each, which I felt was a good price given the amount you got.   Chill, local spot and relatively quick meal. Check it out! Erp.",

The staff was super friendly, explained the menu to us since it as our first time there and first time trying Venezuelan food, so we had no idea what to get. Got two different types of arepas, the Reina Pepiada which was so good and very healthy since its chicken breast with avocado, and the Roasted Pork Butt which was also really good. We also shared an order of Fried Yucca Root which was really good to try, can't just find fried yucca root anywhere. Overall a great experience.  But it is located on the north end of the Strip, kind of a sketchy looking area. Parking is really small, pretty much just a few spaces right in front of the place then its the road.",

There are a ton of arepas to choose from, and they are very filling plus not too expensive. I usually need two arepas or one arepa and a side to feel full, but I eat a lot. They have some grilled items if you are not feeling arepas, and various sides/beverages as well.   Place your order at the counter and give your name, and your name will be called for pickup when ready. Service is good but minimal, as this is a fast casual dining establishment.

    "text": "It's always a pleasure to find little treats like these off the main strip.   Although it's located in an area where you can tell the taxpayers money doesn't get used the business is very clean and the interior was designed on a fairly decent budget.   I phone ordered hoping to save time, which saved me some. No phone pick up system is in place so I still had to wait in a line that forced my food to lose some warmth.   Service  Friendly-ish, the man working the register had the swagger of an owner. He has answers to all your rookie arepa questions and will help you decide on what you want.   Las Arepas  Reina Pepiada: chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. The flavors are layered. The power of the chicken is smothered in the avocado which is hit with a hint of mayo and the mayo is hit with a dab of cilantro. 4.75/5  Pabellon: Beef, black beans, plantains and cheese. This was more of an obvious mixed taste rather than a subtle one.The beef and beans with the plantains with a cheesy start and finish. Good as well but not as chef d'oeuvre as the reina pepiada. 4/5  The masa: The texture and visual has a strong gordita resemblance. The taste is similar as well but cleaner, not as greasy oriented as a gordita. 4.2/5  Sides  Note: Getting fried foods to go will always take away from it's original texture so these will be rated on a +.75 curve.  Yucca Fries: Decent and made a good dip with the arepa sauce they provide for you. 3.75/5  Plantains: I've had better ones made inside my mom's kitchen. 3.25/5  Drinks  I had a Venezuelan soda \"colita\" that was far from special. Welches sodas are better than this. 2/5  Viva Las Arepas?  Si, viva. I loved the arepas. Tasty and something new I had not tried before and I am sure many of you have not either. You've got to try this place out when you're in Vegas. The prices are fair for those that aren't hoping to get by on MGM all day buffet passes. Just make sure to avoid the Venezuelan soda and go with their \"aguas frescas.\"",

    "text": "A couple things to know about this place.  It is in a small strip mall on Las Vegas Boulevard and the place is situated such that you might miss it if you blink.  Also it can be a bit funky getting in and out of the parking lot.  It is on the dodgy end of town as evidenced by the condom wrapper I stepped on when I got out of my car.  If you go at lunch time, there is probably going to be a line and a short wait for food.  That being said totally go here.  The Arepas are delicious and made to order.  There are several other authentic looking items on their menu that warrant a return here for me the next time I am in town.   The prices are reasonable and the service friendly.  One of those authentico places that even a gringo feels comfortable at.",

However, I had already saw the reviews for this and wanted to see what the hype as about.  When we arrived, the place was so cool looking with lots of fun decor and there was a counter with a wall menu where you can order and then they give you a number and call when the food is ready. Seating is booths and tables.   We ordered the #7 Arepa Reina Pepiada and the #9 Arepa Vegetarian - both were fantastic, but I prefer the number 7 over the 9 if you like chicken! The food was served at a great temperature and the arepa was perfect, and authentic from what I have tried from my Venezuelan friends.  You can add cheese and avocado if you want, or even try an arepa by itself. This was the best arepa at a restaurant I have ever had!",

Being as I have nothing to compare this arepa to, I'm going to say it was really good at a really good price point in a fairly centralized location. Got the #1, #7 and the #5.   The #1 was good but it definitely needed the hot sauce for some added flavor. The meat was a little bland and had the meat been really good it would have made this a 5 Star Bite of food.   The #7 was chicken and Cilantro mayo filled arepa, but I would say if you don't LOVE mayo this isn't for you. The cilantro wasn't as forward as I expected.  The #5 was a bean and cheese one and the black beans were the best bite of food we had. Really solid and well balanced this was the best of the 3 we tried.  I will definitely go back and try some more food. Glad we stopped by and gave arepas a try!",

Here they have taken something that could be simple as arepas and super charged it with different flavor that create a whole new twist on Venezuelen cuisine. I'm in love with this place, and can't wait share it with other friends on my next Vegas trip.   We had reina pepiada and wood fire beef arepas. To die for, and you can not go wrong with the chicken thighs plate! So much chicken with your plate PLUS delicious and homemade rice and beans.  Your hungry and in Vegas?! GO HERE!!!",

After seeing all the great press, driving by it a million times, and bookmarking it 8 years ago (ish), I finally made it in. My 2nd visit will be much quicker! The vibe inside is friendly and clean, with a cool patio. It's not fancy, but it is definitely above Roberto's. Each arepa is about $5. Pair it with a side of beans or grilled veggies and a soda and you're about $10. Pretty affordable. Most important: the food is really good. Meats are excellent, the arepa itself is doughy, but with that corn texture. Yum. Good for lunch, dinner, kids, adults. Next door to the best gelato ever (except it's never open). They serve beer, too!",

I like the pollo arepa more than the asada, but I am not much of a beef eater to begin with.  The meat has a smokey taste, great seasoning, and the arepa masa is amazing.

    "text": "Two words: Hot Pockets. Within one block you have dive bar karaoke, custard, a strip club, and now, Hot Pockets!! This has to be one of the greatest corners in Las Vegas. What more could you need?  Arepas are hot pockets of goodness, unless of course you go with the cold ingredients. They are a bit like a cornbread sandwich, as it is a corn dough. I have sampled the black bean and chicken, and I will say that I prefer the chicken. I have not perfected the right amount to order, as they make you really full quickly, but then shortly after you may find yourself snacky again, so my advice: overeat. I think that if you can you should do your best to eat at least 3. Or, just be content with a little snack and have one.  They are served up fresh and hot, and this is a food stand, so expect to sit outside and eat. The service is incredibly friendly and on top of customer service. Special orders do not upset them, and they actually gave my pal an extra empanada because one cracked!  I am a fan of their mango juice. It isn't too sweet and is the perfect refreshing treat to balance the heat of being on a corner in Las Vegas eating a hot pocket.   I Love Arepas should definitely be on your \"must try\" list of Vegas experiences and eats.",

They have a variety of Venezuelan style dishes. Of course the most popular being the Arepas. You can get chicken, beef, vegetarian, cheese, corn, basically there will be SOMETHING you will like. They also serve fried plantains, delicious black beans, empanadas (literally the BEST empanada I have ever had), and chicken cooked on the grill fresh to order. A half a chicken and 2 sides is only $9!  Our table tried a little bit of everything and all of us were extremely happy. Every single thing was fresh and above par. The only thing I didn't get this visit was one of the rare juices. I think I will try the fresh sugar cane with lime next time.  The service was better than average. The lady behind the counter helped me with all the food that I had no clue how to pronounce and also answered my questions in detail. The chef was walking around the entire time making sure things were clean, and patrons were happy.  This place deserves to be on the top 20 MUST TRY in Vegas spots! Without question!",

Rich fried areas (like papusas) with all sorts of great fillings.  The chicharones and yucca were really yummy.  The plantains were INCREDIBLE!!!  I really enjoyed the flour \"bread\" with the beans and cheese.  I liked the sweet corn with mozzarella also.  It was my favorite.  The fries are good but I don't think they are hand cut.  The sauces were yummy as well.  I had never heard of areas before I came to this restaurant and I will definitely look for more in California.  Great late night fare!!!",

    "text": "Ok. I took my mom here about a month ago.  I wanted to give it a try and was very excited!  It was very easy to find but there wasn't much parking in the front.  Therefore, I had to park on the back of the building, which I didn't like because this place is not on the greatest side of the Vegas strip.  This place has indoor and outdoor seating.  We decided to sit inside because it was way too hot!  We went on a Sat afternoon, 1p to be exact. Since this was my first time here, I wanted to take my time and look at the menu.  I was greeted by a gentleman but felt rushed since he was just standing at the register staring at us.  I asked, please give us a few minutes and he just stood there - staring!!!  We ordered the Shredded Beef Arepa, which was $6. I asked for him to tell me how big they were and based on his description and pricing, I'd figure that one would be enough.  We ordered two, one for each and platanos.  We sat down and that's when I noticed that there was only two people there. Found it quite odd, especially on a weekend.  Then the table we chose to sit at was wet and sticky, very nasty!  I had to get some napkins to dry it all off!! The window was nasty full of finger prints.  Then I noticed a bed of dead flies on the window sill.  This really really grossed me out. Then they called my name, my order was done!  I got my food on some baskets which were on a tray. Two squeeze bottles of hot sauce, one green and one red.  The arepas were the size of my palm. Very small!!  They were wrapped up in paper which i had to peel off and very sloppy.  The meat was very well seasoned  and the Arepa was very thin.  I was very very very disappointed!!! I just could not believe how small and over priced they were. This place was filthy filthy filthy!!!  Now I know why this place was completely empty!!  What a shame!!!  This was my first and last time I'll ever go to this place!!  If you want to have a really good Arepa - go to -  OIGA MIRE VEA!! Look them up!! You won't be disappointed!!!",

The Cachapa was amazing! So good!! I wish they had Cachitos- but you cant win them all!   Really Truly Great Venezuelan food- From a Venezuelan......  Quick mention too: GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. Read a couple of reviews on here about bad customer service. People can be WAY to picky! They say hello, they take your order, they bring it to you and they thank you. What more do you need?

The employees definitely has a passion for their food and it shows as service is also outstanding even though it was busy during lunch. The only slight complaint is that it's a little pricey ($4.00 for rice and beans) but I'm definitely willing to overlook it given exactly how good the food and the service is.",

    "text": "I will first start out by saying I am in no way an expert in this cuisine. In fact, this is my first time eating an arepa. I have seen this wonderful item many times on television, so when the opportunity came up to try it, I immediately jumped on the opportunity.  The restaurant, itself, was good sized and in an accessible location. Being just north of the Strip, it was pretty easy to get to. The restaurant has a fast-casual feel. If you want to grab and go, you can (but be advised that the food is prepared to order), or if you want to sit and relax you can. We decided to take in the environment, so we ate it.  The arepas were very delicious. They appear to be relatively small compared to similar items from different cuisines, but they were definitely filling. In this small package contained a plethora of great flavor profiles. We order several different arepas which include the roasted pork, ham and cheese, chicken, carne asada, and shrimp. All were very good as we particularly enjoyed the roasted pork. Accompanying sauce were also flavorful and added to the depth of the arepas.  We also ordered the chicaronnes. This isn't all skin, but meat and skin. Deep fried goodness. This also came with fried yucca which almost resembled fat french fries. Excellent flavor - especially with the green sauce.  Defnitely worth the adventure when you're in Vegas.  FYI - It's on the corner of Oakey and Las Vegas Blvd.",

Well, that's basically what happened to my friends and I when we visited Vegas last month. We wanted an authentic eatery that was flavorful and cheap at the same time. The arepas here was really good but specifically loved their chicken and the shrimp arepas. The chicken was more of a shredded chicken with a creamy pesto like sauce stuffed in a homemade arepa while the shrimp was in a garlicky type sauce with cilantro in it. Honestly, you can't go wrong with any type of arepas as they are all great. Along with the arepas, I had their grilled chicken, salad, and french fries. The chicken was tender, salad was fresh, and fries were nicely crisp. The food was delicious and so happy I gave them a chance and you should too. The ladies that were present were very sweet and was a pleasure to hear how their business began.",

I arrived around 10PM on a Saturday night with my brother-in-law and set my eyes on the vegetarian arepa ($5), although what I actually got was more of a Frankenstein creation. The man at the register (who I'm assuming to be the manager/owner) was super helpful in assisting me with my order.   CUSTOM AREPA ($6ish): My arepa had black beans, cheese, a fried egg, lettuce, tomato, and plantains in it! I topped off each bite with a dash of the cilantro sauce or the spicy red sauce. The fried egg and plantains were the best part. The employee talked me getting into plantains, and I'm glad I decided to try it out in my arepa. It was delicious! I was skeptical that one arepa would fill me up, but by meal's end I was good to go. :) 5/5  For my second visit I got a black bean and cheese arepa, which definitely lacked the creative spark of my Frankenstein creation, but was still yummy nonetheless. My husband got the wood fire beef plate ($10.99) and was happy. The white rice on the side was AMAZING. Soft, buttery, and full of flavor. I'm getting this as my own side on the next visit.   I wish Viva Las Arepas was closer to the locals, but I hear they're opening a second location so there's hope!  YELP 100 CHALLENGE 2016: #43",

This is why I've avoided this place for so long, but I regret that I did just that. What started as a fear ended up being a warm embrace. This Venezuelan establishment is a jewel above standard Latin and South American cuisine.   Located a few blocks north from The Stratosphere at the end of The Strip, lies a little strip mall where a small fast food joint looks to make a big punch with their specialty: the arepa.  Handcrafted and stuffed with flavorful and steaming shredded carne asada, the arepa is a pocket full of inspiring and familiar tastes. Along with the arepas are two sauces to accompany your meal. A spicy salsa-like sauce and a creamy, yet tangy sauce. You have to have one of these sauces at every bite, or you'll be missing out on this beautiful combination.   I ate this with a huge side of subtly tangy Basmati rice. A great combo if you ask me.   The service friendly, quick, and accommodating, you'll feel like you're king of the world during that five minute meal with this Venezuelan staple.",

    "text": "I have no idea why, but lately I've been obsessed with arepas. If I see it on a menu, I'm going to try it out. So when this place popped up on Yelp while we were in Vegas, I knew we were gonna make a stop here, even if it meant venturing off the strip!  Located downtown, we stopped by on our way home from Vegas, around noon on a Sunday. Just a small place, but when we got there, line was to the door.  I had planned to try a couple arepas thinking they would be small enough for me to try more than one. But their arepas are a decent size. So I got one and tried the Reina Pepiada - chicken mixed with mayo, avocado, and cilantro - their take on chicken salad I would think. It was good but after awhile, the mayo just overpowered the arepa. It seemed like there was too much filling for the arepa - which some will say is a good thing. But I really liked the arepa - crunchy crust on the outside, fluffy on the inside. So it would've been nice to have a balance of filling and arepa with every bite.   Got an order of plantains which was really good. Tried the beef and chicken empanadas, but I was not a fan.   Still... I can't wait to go back to Vegas and stop by to try a different arepa... or two!",

The ONLY reason to go to Vegas is for Viva Las Arepas.  One of the best meals you will ever have in your life.  I am not kidding when I say I will return to Vegas JUST to eat here.  Yes, it's that good.  The Reina Pepiada arepa is one of the greatest things you could ever put into your face-hole.  For Bay peeps:  Viva Las Arepas is to Vegas what Gordo's is to the Bay.  For Viva Las Arepas owner(s):  PLEASE COME TO THE BAY AREA!  You will have more business and make more money than you could possibly imagine.  I am not being hyperbolic.  PLEASE.",

The parking in front is somewhat limited, but luckily, I was able to snag a spot. Once you walk in, you place your order at the main counter & they call out your name once it's ready.   On my most recent visit I had the Fried Plantains and the Reina Pepiada arepa. (#7) It was more than enough food, actually, too much food for me. The arepa was absolutely delicious. The breading was soft, the chicken was juicy, and I loved the creamy sauce. I also love the sauces they have on the table. The light green one is the best. It was great on my arepa & the plantains.   This place is awesome & they have quite a few vegetarian options as well which is nice for dining with friends. If you're in the area, check it out! You will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "\"The BEST AREPAS in LV\"  Arepas are my favorite food and you can mostly find them in Florida most of the time. But this place has to the best when compared to any Venezuelan restaurant I have been too.   The dough is so fresh. They make everything by hand and the day of. You can taste the dough melt in your mouth. That's how good it is. They really take their time to make it to perfection.  My favorite is #7 reina pepiada- chicken and avocado. It's seasoned well and the sauce is delish. Not to mention the sauce is like crack. It's so addicting. Gotta get the yuca fries with it!   The location isn't the best but what place is when the food speaks for itself.",

The wood fired beef was just ok, it was definitely smoky as all their wood fired meats are, but I didn't find it so special.  The Roasted pork butt however was dynamite!  The slow braised pork was so tender and the juices soaked into the arepa wrapper.  Mmm, a definite must get!  Everything is made fresh to order even the arepa wrap and they are all stuffed full so 2 is definitely enough to fill you up!  There is also a sauce and a mild sauce.  I defiantly liked the spicy one.    My friends tried the wood fired shredded chicken which i want to try next time but evidently they also just grill up some meats too which might be even better than the arepas, so I'll have to give that a try next time.  Mixed grill; Wood fired chicken, beef, pork ribs, and sausage, enough for 2 people.    There is a parking lot, and we easily found parking but we also went for an early dinner.  I'm not sure if theres a long line that forms at dinner time but i wouldn't doubt it, its pretty darn tasty!",

Las Vegas is known for the casinos, clubs, and buffets but local comfort food like this make any experience more memorable. These little Venezuelan patties fuel the heart, soul, tummy you name it. They are absolutely amazing. The one thing I look forward to when I come to Vegas. The Reina is my go to. Meat is tender and full of flavor. Seasoning is A-RATE(pa). It's covered in their special sauce, which really binds the whole arepa together. If you had it once, you'll never be the same again.   This is where you want to burn your money. If you wind up broke well you'll always remember that you had a swinging time.",

The warm welcome once we walked in the door is always a big plus for me, as it shows acknowledgement and appreciation for the next customer in line  I had myself one arepa, a beef one, and I must say that it looks like a \"gordita\" that are sold in Mexican restaurants but nonetheless it does not taste like a Mexican one; Arepas have their own flavor, their own delight, they have a very tasty \"dough\" and their salsas are really yummylicious! They are well packed and served, although I will say that the beef needed a bit more seasoning.. it was a bit bland to my taste.  I surely will make this a choice of spots to visit when I'm thinking of quick bites!  Shout out to the staff who were super friendly!",

    "text": "We discovered arepas from a local farmer's market in San Diego where we originate.  When yelp notified us that there was a restaurant in Vegas that specializes in this delicious treat, we had to make the trek out for yummy eats.  It's waaay at the end of the strip past the ghost towns of Stratosphere.  Easy to spot and plenty of parking around, you'll be able to easily navigate to the venue. There's plenty of tables and I loved how they had an open view of the kitchen to see their masterpiece(s) being made.  They also have plenty of pictures all around the restaurant to awaken your palate and make your tummy rumble.  We opted for the chicken and pork arepas (see photos).  They're packed fat with generous meat and both meats were extremely delicious and well seasoned.  I do wish they were a bit bigger (since they are so tasty) and I think you could order an extra one to share (notes for next time).  The man at the counter appeared to be the owner and he's serious about what he does -- his passion for his restaurant shows.  We also picked up an order of the yucca and chicharones.. I like the yucca but the chicharones was a bit on the dry side.  There's an easy fix though -- just douse it in the green garlic sauce.. which is DELICIOUS.  Hubbie and I pretty much squeezed half a bottle on everything since it was so yum.  I liked the juices and definitely would return to try other menu items.  Take a moment to read the articles on the wall and you'll see the blood, sweat and tears that put this brick and mortar together.  It's clean, beautiful, tasty and lots of fun menu items.. all for a reasonable price.  Highly recommended and would most definitely return.  Five stars!",

Unlike many other places in the area, this place is clean clean. Bathrooms are coded for use only of customers, so they are also clean and secured. This place is Orderly. Friendly. Service was great and fast. If you need to see the food they will gladly show and share what they serve. Food was seasoned to remind me of home food. So so good. They also have platanos AND plates that are paired with rice in case you want the whole Shabam! Let me also tell you they proudly display their well earned awards and news reports about their delicious food. I came from California but my family knows this place very well and we always stop by to have some amazing Arepas! Mi gente no se lo puede perder!",

    "text": "Been here multiple times and it's by far one of the best places to go if you are looking for cheap eats in Las Vegas. We always order the   Reina Pepiada - That avocado sauce is so good with the chicken and this is one of our favorites. A must order for sure.  Pernil - The roasted pork butt as far as meat by itself is probably the most flavorful and me not being a pork fan appreciated this arepa for what it was...delicious goodness.  Carne Asada - To me this is ok...has more of a beef jerky, dried, and smokey flavor to it which is good but compared to the two arepas above does not compare to overall flavor.  Always order their drinks...soooo good.  One of the staples of places you must go to in Las Vegas.",

    "text": "This is a good place to come get some arepas in town. A Colombiano cuisine eaten regular by them. They have a variety of options to choose from as well as good aguas frescas.   Plenty of seating inside and you're usually comfortably filled up with a couple of them + a drink.  Why only 3 stars you may ask? Well, I've been coming here for several years now and a lot has seem to have downgraded except their prices. The arepa itself seemed smaller, the flavor of the meat fillings wasn't as good as it used to, I tried their two sauces and they tasted pretty old.  The hot sauce lacked flavor.  I've seen this happen before with business  I usually go to: they gain a comfortable clientele, then they downgrade quality, portions become smaller, but prices increase.  Had you asked me 3 years ago about this it would have been one of my favorite, good, and cheap places to eat.   I really hope they can bounce back :)",

    "text": "I can official say that I (really do) Love Arepas. Like Paolo D. I had the lengua and tasted the tripe arepas. Highly recommend both.  For those unfamiliar, here's a quick description lifted from wikipedia (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fen.wikipedia.org%2Fwiki%2FArepas&s=c5aa31212fd84f85ca1cc975fe93ac3c80e373e5e3ae5096f5e798ed1885c9c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ar...</a>): \"Arepa is a native sort of bread made of ground corn, water, and salt which is fried into a pancake-like bread. It is either topped or filled with meat, eggs, tomatoes, salad, cheese, shrimp, or fish.\"  Paolo D. and I came here on a recommendation from Nelson Q. Best recommendation ever. I've had arepas before and they were usually overly greasy or their filling was under-seasoned, but this place hit the spot. Maybe I got lucky and ordered two fillings that I really enjoyed, but I was one happy camper after having an arepa.   The one downside is that there's absolutely nowhere to sit (this place is in a kiosk-like location in a parking lot in downtown -- think food truck without the wheels). Also I was really confused about how the ordering/paying worked because the guy working the cashbox really didn't seem to know what he was doing.",

I Love Arepas was only on its 3rd day of being open, so of course there is always room for improvement.   Felix was very accomidating to our needs.  He said the best arepa to try was the reina pepiada which is shredded chicken, pieces of hot dogs tossed in mayo, cheese and avocado. It was light but wasnt my cup of tea. I wouldnt order this again.   Next, we had the carne mechada, which was way better!  Last, we were going to order the chicken but decided to get the pernil (pork butt). Felix wanted to make us happy so we told him if he could add black beans and salted cheese. This one was my fav! The arepas itself was very moist and not very heavy at all as opposed to Caracas in New York.  As for a place just starting out,  Felix knows he has to make some changes to the menu and the venue (adding chairs, tv outside), which i commend him for listening to his customers, as he took note of our suggestions.  The arepas are great, but there needs to be a variety of components instead of just a meat filling.   Will def be back to see the improvements that will be made.",

Arepas outside of South America?  + from a little building that is just barely bigger than a hot dog cart? I'm in.  First off, I LOVE arepas. I go to South America a lot, + arepas are these little fried corn patties stuffed with all kinds of things, usually deep fried + heaven at 3am after a night of dancing that they sell on the streets of Colombia and Venezuela. They're like the drunk-munchies equivalent of seasoned curly fries here in the U.S.  The guy working there was also the owner, + he could not have been sweeter. This was my boyfriend's first arepa experience, + the owner asked him questions + made suggestions for what he might enjoy. We ordered our arepas, + he threw in a free empanada because my boyfriend had never tried one of those either.  The arepas here aren't the same greasy deep-fried ones I'm used to, but they are SUPER delicious.  the corn casings are really fresh, + the ingredients are fresh, warm, + delicious. He serves his food with sides of jalapeno and cilantro sauce to give them an extra kick if you like heat on your food.  There's also a big assortment of tropical juice that's really fresh + inexpensive (plus, refills are only $.99: such a bargain!).  It's always nice to see owners taking pride in their work, + the owner came out to deliver our food himself, + stayed to chat with us while we ate.  Really pleasant experience, + a nice cap to a weekend in The Vegas.",

Both were greasy and not worth the price. $5 for an Arepa the size of your fist??  I've had this place bookmarked. Now, bookmark checked! Time to move on.  Longer Review: Viva Las Arepas has been one of my bookmarks since I was introduced to their neighbor, the great Art of Flavors. Yes, Viva is located right next door in case you didn't know.  Upon entering, you're hit with nothing but orange and a menu with a decent selection.  At first, the prices looked pretty good until you get your food. I got the Beef Arepas and a Beef Empanada.  They both tasted \"Just Ok\" and were super oily. For a minute, I thought I was eating a beef chimichanga. Both were also so small that I was able to finish my Arepas in about 3 bites.  I know I can't mention names, but I have had better Arepas out here in Vegas. Better in regards to price, value, and most importantly, taste. All is not lost though.  Their plantains and the service were both excellent.  I may be back, but most likely for their plantains only.  See Ya' But not here...I'll be next door enjoying the best peanut butter gelato.",

    "text": "A little late hopping onto the Viva Las Arepas but at least I did! First time trying arepas and boy was I blown away. I would pick arepas over tortillas any day. I am a lover of anything doughy and the texture and thickness of the arepa was just perfect for me. Add in some deliciously seasoned pork butt and beef and you have a heavenly combo! My favorite would definitely have to be the pork butt. It was perfectly seasoned and the meat just melted in your mouth. They also have a house cilantro-garlic sauce which was a perfect pairing. In addition to the arepas that I got, I also got an order of the pork rinds and yucca root. Pork rinds were delicious but the fried yucca root was the star. They tasted just like French fries! except much better because the outside was super crunchy and the inside was flaky. Yum-O.   ONLY downfall is that it is located downtown (which I am not a big fan of). Overall, this place is definitely worth the drive.",

After scanning reviews and the menu we settled on the Garlic Shrimp (hot), Wood Fired Beef, and a couple of Tequenos (fried cheese sticks). I feel the food was pricey for the quantity. I liked the cheese sticks, but Doug thought they tasted too sweet. The Garlic Shrimp was ok (Like shrimp scampi on a maize bun) the shrimp was a little mushy and after a few bites was over it. The beef was ok too, just not a lot of flavor even with the sauces. I guess we just don't get the appeal. The service was good but... I would not go back. I rather save room for gelato.",

My sister got the carne arepa but we both didn't care for it... It tasted more like pork. We will be trying the pollo next time.   YOU MUST TRY THIS PLACE! I'm obsessed.

The menu is in both English and Spanish and price are reasonably affordable as compared to restaurants on the strip. The air circulation could improved. It was a bit muggy inside but satisfying enough to be away for the Las Vegas heat.  There was a good variety of food available so narrowing can be tough. I've ordered the chicken arepa while my brother ordered the beef arepa. I recommend the beef over the chicken. Personally, I believe there's more flavor between the two. The outside of the arepa is a bit oily so be careful not to remove the wrapping. I made the mistake of removing it and it broke into pieces.  By the way, they charge 50 cents for a cup of water as indicated on the sign. What kind of place does this for tap water? This is a disaster recipe for BYOH2O.",

I ordered chicken thighs rice and beans, and a guava cheese pastry. I couldn't stand the burning eyes trauma any longer and waited outside by the patio area until my food was ready.   Very disappointing, I expected several whole chicken thighs and I got boneless skinless dry chicken. The flavor tasted like charred tasteless chicken and I had to request ketchup just to flavor it up a little. The rice and beans were ok, but not very tasty. Had it not been for the dessert, this place would have flopped! I truly did enjoy the guava cheese pastry. The moist and flaky pastry with guava and cheese filling was delicious and tasty.   Overall, the place had a nice ambiance and the service was excellent. The air quality and venting needs a makeover to ensure customers truly dine in, not outside.",

Atmosphere: The restaurant itself is pretty spacious. There was a pretty good amount of places for people to sit.  Service: The guy at the counter was really nice. He was helpful with some recommendations. It was kind of hard for us to hear what order they were calling. They give you two bottles, one red and one white, with your order. That was nice since you usually just go to a counter in other places for the sauces.  Food: I decided to get the chicken salad arepa and shredded beef. The chicken salad was really good. It was nice and saucy. The shredded beef was too hot to eat. I took a couple of bites, it was okay. I decided to save it for later. When I ate it a couple of hours later, I thought it tasted better. My friend decided to try the garlic shrimp. She said it was a little too saucy. At the end of the meal it was leaking and looked really hard to eat. She said it was good at first though.",

I'm glad I tried this place. I went for the pork butt arepa ($4.50) and shredded beef arepa ($5.00), making the cheese upgrade ($0.50) for both. Fried corn filled with a decent quantity of meat is already a recipe for success, and you can add the cilantro sauce (in the yellow or one of the clear bottles) or the spicier red sauce that I sampled a bit of. I think the shredded beef actually had more flavor than the pork butt, but that means the pork butt is a better vehicle for the sauces.  I also tried my friend's fried plantain, which was about as mushy and brown as you'd expect if you just fried a plantain (or banana) on your own at home. It's not very sweet at all, so it's rightfully listed as a side and not a dessert.  The prices could be better given the relatively small portion sizes - I wasn't too full afterward - and the arepas do lack just a bit of the extra flavor oomph that would take it to the next level. However, I could see myself coming back here for future \"one-two punch\" trips.  P.S. Art of Flavors was solid, as usual.  (UPDATE: Downgrade from 4-stars to 3-stars. After having tried Rika Arepa Express, the other big game in town, I realized how lacking in flavor these arepas are. Oh, and Street Dogs also does arepas better.)",

Heck, this place is a great option if you're looking for real, good food. The servings are huge - the arepas are a little bigger than the size of your fist (I guess that depends on how big your fist is). The ingredients are fresh and the flavor is super robust! My mouth is watering just thinking about it. I ordered the garlic shrimp and the vegetarian arepas. My boyfriend, who's half Venezuelan (and he's even been to Venezuela) said that he thinks the vegetarian one is the best one he's ever had. He even wanted it as his last bite after he finished his chicken arepa. We also ordered a side of plantains and some passion fruit juice - both of which were sweet and scarfed down. A patron also told us that the fries are delicious - fresh cut like In N Out's, but better.  Felix was a pleasure to talk to and order from. The pricing is extremely reasonable ($4-$6/arepa), and we only needed 2 each to fill up before our drive back to LA. We waited a little bit for the food to be ready (clearly, I need instant gratification), but it was definitely for a good reason. The parking lot is small and shared with other stores, but we were able to find a spot for lunch; despite the small parking lot, the restaurant is spacious with plenty of seating. I hope I pass through Vegas soon, so I could get some more!",

I go here at least a couple of times a month because:  - it's cheap - I don't have to think about what I'm gonna get, since I always get the same things - it's right next door to AOF  The arepas range in price from $4 for a cheese arepa to $7 for a garlic shrimp arepa. I usually stick to eating the Reina Pepiada, (chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro), or the Perico, (scrambled egg, ham & cheese, onion and tomato). If I'm not mistaken, the Reina Pepiada is the only arepa served cold. Kind of reminds me of a cold chicken salad sandwich, but with a lot more chicken.   Nice to have places like this to dine at, especially if you are budget-conscious. Beats the hell out of going to a fast food chain. For $20, you and a date can grab an arepa here with a huge order of fries, then bounce over to AOF to grab dessert. After dessert, have some fun and browse the selection of lingerie and adult novelties in the boutique next door! Cheap and convenient date options!",

I've been to Venezuela and remember the amazing arepa bread sandwiches from my travels. How hot and delicious they were.   So when I saw this place I was so excited. Then disappointed. The breads were cold and the chicken, avocado, cilantro filling was just plain bland. The fried plantains were good.  I wanted an empanada but the deep fryer was down.   I hope I came at the wrong time and got an off meal as I love seeing ethnic restaurants succeed.   Please try them at least once and hopefully the results will be better than mine.",

Put some of those sauces on them and you have a winning situation!!",

The green sauce (not spicy just favorable) is a MIST on the Arepas. Besides the Arepas though the Cachapas were one of my favorite dishes on the menu. They kind of reminded me of Salvadorean Pie de Queso mixed with Mexican Corn tamales with a lotta delicious salty & sweet cheese in the middle. It's both salty and sweet. My sister ate her Cachapa with Hot Chocolate and I ate mine with the green sauce (which I can't remember the name of). After trying this spot out for the first time, it will immediately become one of this comfort foods you crave for a good filling and satisfies feeling.",

Apparently, an arepas is a flatbread made of maize, but I'd liken it to a fried English muffin. Then throw meat inside and you get a delicious snack. They range from 5-7 dollars, and I got Reina Pepiada (chicken breast, mayo, avocado, cilantro) and the Shredded Beef (with bell peppers, onions, tomato). I liked the shredded beef a lot more than the chicken breast, and both are excellent value.   I think this place would be perfect after spending a day at the North Outlets and I would definitely go again. I would really like to try the pork butt next time along with the shredded beef.",

The guava cheese pastry sounds so good on the menu but all it really was was guava jam with half melted weird cheeses deep fried in a pills berry type dough kindda good just couldn't get use to the cheese and the jam had a weird fragrant unguavay flavor.  My favorite out of the meal I got was the deep fried yucca with pork belly nuggets sooo good but it looked weird. I would recommend trying it because it's trendy and the yucca was bomb but expect to pay and arm and a leg those 3 small items cost me $18 or so!",

I don't know what Samantha G. got but that chicken was spot on- crispy skin, hint of smokey, finger lickin' greasy, just salty enough and so good I ate a leg and took a bite out of my husband's wing- I'm a picky chicken eater and usually skip these parts. Frankly, I like chicken fine but am not the biggest fan in my family- THIS chicken however- wow. I cannot wait to go back and get the meat platter. I might disaparate in happiness.  Oh- Arepas also very good. Can't rave about the texture (I found it a bit crumbly) but the Pernil (pork butt) was off the charts good. We got it with avocado and I recommend you do the same.  I second the \"crack sauce\" suggestion- it would make shoe leather taste good.  Mango agua fresca also very good- not too sweet as it often is at a Taqueria.  So - why no 5 stars? Well, maybe I'm being overly picky because that chicken was amazing, but I do five stars for a home run and their sides were lackluster and the arepa was a little dry. Is this overly harsh?   The bathroom was functional and clean but not good enough to bump them to 5 stars, I liked the small utilitarian steel sink, but not a lot else to commend it..  I'm gonna stick with 4 stars on this but let's call this \"unequivocally recommended.\" We'll see what happens after that meat platter.",

    "text": "*Yelp 100 challenge complete!  As much as Vegas is founded on facades and paradoxes, I found it pleasantly appropriate that perhaps the best food I had in Vegas came from this hole-in-the-wall place in the corner of a sketchy looking strip mall far from the Strip as opposed even to the meal I had a L'Atelier de Joel Robuchon!  One of the benefits of Vegas is that can you drive a few miles and start your morning with some Hawaiian Poke, have some French for lunch, and finish with Venezuelan food. I'm glad we came here, saving this local gem for last.  The Arepas here were fantastic all served piping hot. To rank them in order:  1) Reina Peplada: Chicken Breast, Mayo, Avocado, Cilantro 2) Wood Fire Beef - think carne asada 3) Garlic Shrimp - big pieces of shrimp just not the best shrimp in quality  The corn meal bun is crisp and houses some incredibly tasty meat. They give you sauces but thats not necessary with all that is going on in the arepas.   Also the Yucca Root fries were good fat fries but I will go with their normal french fries next time.  And I know it is just rotisserie chicken but something about that actual hickory wood fire grill really brought out the flavor in the Wood Fire Chicken plate ($14.99). It was perfectly moist and tender and the skin was the right amount of char and crisp.  I thought the Passion Fruit juice edged the Mango juice and it is refreshing and the right complement to the arepas.  My advice to Vegas-goers is to take a slight detour to Viva Las Arepas for some very delicious comfort food. Then make it extra special by going right next door to Art of Flavors (one of the best gelatos I've had in the city).   Viva Las Arepas!  Tip: Ask to sample juice flavors",

I haven't eaten Venezuelan food in a long time, but Viva Las Arepas definitely walks away with a home run!

Other dishes include pabellon (shredded  beef, plantains, rice and black beans) and carne asada (beef, chicken or pork) barbecued on mesquite wood. If you have a sweet tooth and feel adventurous they have a selection of Venezuelan chocolates and candies, as well as pastries.  Small indoor and outdoor seating areas; parking is available in the rear of the building. Service was very courteous and arrived quickly (you order and pick up at the counter). While they do not deliver you can order from Uber Eats and they will pick up and deliver to you.

Food was fast especially when I was just waking up on my day off, thy welcomed my pup on the patio and gave lots of extra sauces without me having to beg or pay. Next on the agenda, the pork butt. Do it. Enjoy yourself. Totally affordable, 4-6 bucks an arepa (fills you up), cheap cans of pop, horchata, $2.50 apps and huge sides. Great location near those of us locals in the art district and great for those drunk tourists on the north end of the strip. Park behind the building on casino center if you don't want to loop around the one ways. Really. Do it.",

It was very tasty tho... make sure to use the 'hot' sauce provided on the tables, very good alongside the arepas.  5-STARS for the Soursop drink... I had never ever heard of it beforehand and it was so delicious that I may just go back to this place just for that drink specifically.",

I am delighted to see some authentic south american (Venezuelan) fare.    I LOOOOOVE their EVERYTHING. The Arepas here are perfection...fluffy pillows stuffed with goodies and the empanadas are to die for. I highly recommend trying one of everything.   My faves:  Arepas: Garlic Shrimp, shredded beef Empanadas: Shredded Chicken, Bacalao (cod fish)  Also you absolutely have to try the passion fruit juice (parchita)...this is probably one of two places in all of Vegas I've found that serves this...

Cachapas were also very flavorful and slightly sweet.",

My favorite thing to eat there is the #7 Reina Pepiada, which is a shredded chicken breast salad, made with avocado, mayo, cilantro and peas.It is definitely the star on the menu, but the carne mechada, pork butt (pernil) and the bean and cheese arepas are also great. I usually ask for cotija cheese on the arepas, it's yummy.  Make sure to try the juices too.They are refreshing, especially on a hot Vegas day. I like the Tamarindo and the Agua de Panela (sugar cane and lime). The staff is great, they really take pride in their service. This is hands down my favorite fast food in Vegas and everyone should check it out!",

My last visit I ordered the Wood Fire Mix Grill (for two people), consisting of chicken, beef, pork ribs and sausage with two sides for $22.99.  The ribs (which are large spare ribs) and the chicken were excellent; the beef was a little dry and it had a little bit too much spice.  I guess it was a brisket but over spiced and too dry.  The sausage was flavorful but I didn't care for the texture of it.  My sides were the fried Yucca plant and rice with vegetables, which were decent.  I also had the plantains, which were excellent.  They do serve nice size portions and it's right near the Strip with parking.  Overall, I would try it again for the chicken and spare ribs.",

We were leaving Dino's and a friend suggested we get Arepas, since I'd never tried them before. We got a beef arepa and a lingua arepa. When i tasted the yummy, cheesy, tender filling surrounded by the moist corn flour wrap I could barely put it down. I love that they leave the sauce on the side, so you can add it to your liking. The shredded beef was so tender and hearty. The lingua (beef tongue) tasted very similar to a slow cooked pot roast that had been shredded and sauteed with peppers and onions. It was spicy and the accompanying sauce made it even more so. It was delicious! It took some liquid courage to get me to try it, but now I'm hooked! I'm actually considering driving there on my lunch hour today (completely sober of course)! This place is a must try if you've never had an Arepa, or if you're close to downtown and hungry!",

They cook the masa batter on a little flat top to order and fill 'em with your choice of meats and stuff.    Screw all of those hipster food trucks that are more about the twitter feed and the graphics on the truck than the food (yeah, you, sloppi jo's.  greasy, runny pork with no depth of flavor with an egg on top and an untoasted, stale, store-bought tortilla on the side?  no thank you).  Hey look at us!  We're a bunch of goofy 20 year olds who know nothing about food but check out our cool truck and tattoos and goofy dances and overpriced junkfood served in a parking lot!  To me the idea behind a truck is good, cheap food that's convenient.  If you have to DRIVE to the truck, then what's the point.  The truck should be where you are.  YOU shouldn't have to go to IT.    But I digress...  The masa pancake bread thing is crispy on the outside and creamy on the inside.  They split em and fill em with any of a dozen or so goodies, including tongue and tripe.  The fillings were yummy without exception.  I got a bean and cheese, a pork, and a beef.  All were delish.  Served with a chili sour cream sauce and a pureed hot sauce.  Also tried an empanada as well.  It was odd but good.  Very little filling in the deep-fried empanada and the masa shell blew up like a balloon from the steam created inside while in the fryer which actually made for a pillow-like chickeny pocket of love.  Bonus points for its location out front of Dino's, a great dive bar on LV Blvd.  Conveniently located right underneath a billboard for a bailbondsman, across the street from the OG.  Hit it.",

Both were yummy and each came with its own special sauce. Very tasty and a super deal. I can imagine this as a perfect hangover cure too. Luckily, that wasn't my experiece of it this time. I would like to go back and try more from their menu. Easy walk from the nearest Duece bus stop - North of the Stratosphere.",

    "text": "This was a fantastic sandwich. From the loads of meat inside to the potato shelling of the arepa, I was in a great place while eating. Both the chicken and beef were great but that beef was something else and had a full on sandwich feel with the inclusion of tomato and lettuce to make sure you fill up. I had two sandwiches which in hindsight is a lot because you really need 1 and a side or 1.5 for a nice meal, but I was just in a zone with the taste and couldn't stop. They have a few sauces to add on which could have been spicier but overall good selection of juices to add on. I would say service is a little slow as I went during an off hour and still had a 15 minute wait. Also, $5 might be a $1 high for this size of a sandwich but I'm willing to pay for quality. Just get 2 and a side and a you're set for the next couple days. Great choice if in the area and looking for a unique meal.",

If you never had an arepa, you're missing out on some good maize meal dough and and filled with some delicious cheese, meats, and other yummy ingredients.  If you're scared of drug addicts and bums hanging out in the parking lot, then don't come here at night. But it ain't that bad, you can handle it, it's still on the Strip. Come for lunch instead if you a wuss.  All the arepas are made to order so it might take awhile. But worth the wait. If you're really hungry, order 2. If you're full, still order 1 and enjoy it. Get some of that soursop/guanabana juice while you're here too, it's refreshing.  I ordered a pork butt arepa with cheese. Just look at my picture and your mouth will water already. I don't even have to describe it, it tastes just as good as it looks!  Viva arepa!",

The cheese arepas have the most glorious mixture of mozzarella and what I believe may be cotija cheese. The empanadas and tequenos are also delicious. They also offer two delicious sauces one mild green chile sauce and a creamy variety with cilantro and garlic. My boyfriend always orders the passion fruit juice.  My office is just down the street so now everyone at my job is also hooked. I love this place!  The only negatives is that soft drinks are served in cans. A soda fountain would be much more convenient. I also wish there was another location closer to my house.   Other than that, this place owns my heart. And stomach.",

There are two bottles of sauce that are offered up with your food. The first is a reddish color and spicy and the second is an off-white sauce that is a blend of mayo, cilantro, garlic and lime juice that is absolutely delicious! I could put that on everything I eat and be very happy about it. So, we asked the recipe and she gave us the basic ingredients and my wifey made it at home recently. SOOOO good.

    "text": "I've always driven by this place and wondered what it was. Location wise, it's actually quite bad. Why? Well, it it's right in the middle of going towards downtown or going towards the strip. If you have an agenda, you'll always pass by this place. I think it's taken me over 5 years to finally try here. So this time while in Vegas, as I always try a local joint when I'm in town, Viva Las Arepas it was!   There is parking in the strip mall here. Depending what time you come here, it can be packed or not. We came at 7pm when it was packed and left at 8pm when it was not. The signage for the menu can be daunting at first. But when you look closer, it's really the same thing in English and the same thing in Spanish. They're not quite mirror perfect, but trust me it's the same.   I was a little hungry the day I was here, with some 4 other friends. We ordered almost $90 worth of food and drinks. No, I'm not kidding.  We got to try a lot of different things from here. So here it goes:  Wood Fire Beef-cut in thick 1/2 inch strips. Flavorful, not tender,slightly on the salty side,  great with the mojo sauce. They do give you quite a bit. Think of beef jerky but just a tad softer.  The side of beans and white rice were ok, nothing to be excited about and the portions were really small.   Fried Plantains-I have to say, this was the BEST fried plantains I have tasted anywhere. I've been to a lot of places and this place does it slightly crispy on the outside, soft and not overly sweet once you bite into it. MUST order.  Fried Yucca-So these are cut in one inch strips and fried. I thought they would be as good as the plantains. NO, they're not ! They tasted strange. It had a weird aftertaste on some of them I had. I do question the freshness of the Yucca.   Mango drink-Tasted like a watered down version of a mango lassi. Honestly, skip it.   Arepas-Now the arepas itself, they were quite good. They were airy that I couldn't taste any of the cornmeal. As for the fillings, there are plenty of choices but ugh, the line cook here put way too much salt into the shredded beef one.   Most of us liked this place but personally it's not one of those places I'm dying to go back. Prices here aren't quite cheap for cheap eats. They do open until 12am so if you want something different, I would definitely come here. 3.5 stars.",

When the food came out I  added some of the sauces and the food was good, but the portion  in my opinion  is kinda small.   Wouldn't  really try  them again if I  had other options.",

    "text": "Wow, I have passed by this place of a restaurant they call Viva Las Arepas, an authentic Venezuelan eatery or so they say...literally it's on the signage. Could this be a gimmick of those never ending self proclaiming best in Las Vegas slogans? The curiosity got to me by family members and friends visiting this restaurant only to give good reviews...and so it tickled my mind to ponder and search on Yelp what the hype was about this snazzy independent spot.   Upon checking it out on this review place called YELP...the high ratings were affirmation ... So the reviews speak for it self and with that my taste buds were now wondering how good it really is.  Wifey and I decided to check it out. The location it self is off Oakey on Las Vegas Blvd...just a few blocks away from the Stratosphere Hotel and Casino. The area is known for its tourists but at the gate way to downtown the homeless lurk with mostly innocent intentions, maybe a few bad apples once in awhile.   If you are not familiar with the area, I recommend checking them out day time and or with a group of people.  Upon entering the vicinity, the bright walls and shiny tiles capture an artists eye like a palette of colors inviting and pleasing...accompanied by a delicious aroma welcoming you to an open space floor plan. The prices are average at around $5-6 dollars for a nice size portion. Just know that it is fulfilling that with the variety of choices you will have to come back...and that is what I plan to do.  The wifey and I decided to go with #1 Carne Asada, #4 Roasted Pork & #7 Reina grilled chicken breast with avocado...all equally delicious. Would have love to try more...but definitely next time I will be back.",

    "text": "Let just say my appetite was araped. But it was consensual so... that is just something to think about. I hope no one is offended by that... and if you are well... whatever.  So this place was really good. How often do I eat arepas you ask? never. This was my first time and they are really delicious... i wish i remember the ones I liked but... i tried every single one!! avoid the ones with tomatoes i remember not liking those... also I dont like long walks on the beach.  The meat flavoring is really delicious. All of the empanadas are good... but especially the bean one.... OMGG (double G). So i strongly recommend eating it. also buying 80 dollars worth of food get them to treat you really well... but that is buying everything on the menu.  It is a great place to try.   THE VERDICT: Well... let me think for a second... do you like venezuela... if you say no you are a racist so... go get some arepas or you are a racist. its science. I really enjoyed it, if you are in the area hit it up. Also its next to a bails bond thing so... if someone gets arrested... you got some yummy arepas and freedom.",

    "text": "I discovered this place after falling in love with Art of Flavors, next door..go here after 1pm so you can grab dessert there afterwards, if you have any room left that is!  My husband got the wood-fired chicken arepa and it was delicious! We also shared 3 empanadas--a beef, a shredded chicken, and a black bean and cheese.   In the arepa, the chicken was perfectly seasoned, and complimented by the sauce and veggies. On it's own in the empanada, the wood-smoked flavor was a big too strong for my tastes, and I found myself using lots of their delicious hot sauce to mellow it out. The black bean and cheese was more mildly flavored. I liked that it was whole beans vs mashed like I had been expecting. My favorite of the three was definitely the beef! It was so tender if was falling apart but it seemed like a combination of shredded and ground beef, and it was fantastic!!  The restaurant is counter service, and the employees were extremely friendly. They weren't busy (we were there early) and they brought our food to the table. It was bright and airy, and spotlessly clean. They also have a nice little patio for seating.   We will be returning, I can't wait to try that delicious beef in an arepa!",

I wasn't really sure what Arepas were but I'm up for an adventure. I briefly read up a bit on what to expect and went with the flow when I got there. Trying to recover from the Smashburger hangover from the night before and still thinking about that Black Bean Burger, I got the Vegetarian Arepa and a side of Rice with Veggies.   So I found out that an Arepa is like a cornmeal English muffin crossed with taco like fillings. In my Vegetarian Arepa was Black Beans, Onions, Tomato and Avocado. So good! At $5 it was a pretty good \"sandwich\". Leave it in the wrapper it comes in it will help save you from losing all the insides. The Rice and Veggies were good and a decent size portion but for $2.99 for white rice and canned mixed veggies, I filled up enough with just my Arepa.   This was a counter service restaurant. You order at the counter, you pick up your food at the counter and your put your own trash in the trash can that is clear and obvious to put your trays and baskets on top.   I'll be back!! It was delish!!",

Anything is better when you add avocado, but with chicken salad? I can't even.   We ordered a bunch of stuff to share including the Reina Pepiada arepa, shredded beef arepa, pork butt arepa, garlic shrimp arepa, chicken and beef empanadas, chicharones, and yucca fries.   I wasn't a fan of the shredded beef, it reminded me of frozen burritos. Everything else was really good. Don't forget to drench your food in the cilantro mayo, it's amazing!",

But we are in America, authentic don't mean anything any mo'. Like my excellent grammar, when cooking a particular ethnic Cusine take some liberties, like GW and his guerrilla tactics on the Potomac...improvise mo-fo.   Order the #7. It was a chicken with cilantro and avocado. And #1 - chicken...and there is a beef one in there as well. The yuca was lame, not enough breading (if you are going to fry yuca, the fry the yuca).  The kids loved the chicken and cheese empanadas. I like the story of the chef. Really busted his ass to get a place going. That makes me like the place more. I want him to be a success. The lady at the POS was very nice, but if she was Venezuelan, I'm from Alpha Centauri. More like Mexizuelan. Worth the trip...yes (but it is halfway down the list of places to go in downtown LV). So much good food here (love that grammar).",

I didn't know what was up and what was down, so I trusted her judgment on what to order, and the menu board has stars by the most popular items as well. I got the chicken arepa with avocado, some sort of lime/mayo sauce, and peas. I have a major thing for any food item with guava as well, so I grabbed a guava & cheese pastry. The wait for food to go wasn't too horrible, but I wouldn't say it was quick.   The pastry unfortunately was downright gross. I am assuming that the cheese was supposed to be melted considering it was a hot pastry, but when I bit into it, there was just a hard and rubbery stick of white cheese in the middle. The guava jam was slightly bitter, and needless to say, I was disappointed. The chicken arepa was good, but find me something with avocado and lime that isn't!",

The owner, Felix, went above and beyond and made a very nice impression on us.",

    "text": "A quick word to the wise - this place might be a stand on the side of the road, but the food takes awhile to prepare.  The freshness is well worth the wait, but if you are pressed for time, don't expect to order and walk away quickly.  When we approached the window of this fantastic little food stand, we must've looked puzzled, because a woman quickly gave us the rundown on the whole menu.  She told us her favorites, ordered for herself, and then told us, \"This place is really good.  I should know, I'm from Venezuela and I love the way they cook here.\"  Emboldened, we walked away with two arepas.  We had actually had arepas before, in Brooklyn - they are kind of similar to the dish some parts of Mexico call a quesadilla.  Thick masa is formed into a pita-type shape, or sandwich-style, around delicious fillings.  I think these might've been even better than the ones in NYC.  The masa was crunchy and chewy all at once; the fillings were boldly seasoned and complex.  My favorite was the Reina Pepiada.  It was a chicken salad with peas, and it was the bee's knees.   I followed one of my cardinal rules for unfamiliar Spanish-language foods - if the title isn't a direct translation, its probably a regional favorite, and it was.  Very excited that there's cheap and delicious food easily accessible from either Fremont or the Strip.  Highly recommended.",

I had the Reina Pepiada arepa.. and almost died!!! I also tried the pork, beef balck bean and cheese and they were all astonishingly good. I wanted to try it all. In the week that I was there I found this place the last couple of days before leaving and managed to go three more times! I also hadall  the pastelitos and my favorite was the cheese and coconut. Read the inspirational story behind the chef and owners story it was heart warming. PLUS you must go the the sister Gelatto store next door.. also break taking desserts!",

The place, is typical, very similar to what you would find in any corner in a Venezuelan city. The food, all fresh, made from scratches, with real corn flour, and made in front of your eyes. All the ingredients are prepared daily and the rest is just enjoy and invite!!!   Its totally worth to visit, prices are very affordable and the attention 5 stars!

I also got 2 empanadas ($3 each) which were just okay but soggy by the time I got home. I ordered this all to go and was so eager to open up everything and chow down.

You must also try the soursop drink which is so refreshing and makes you want to drink more. I wish they made soursop shakes because those are amazing.

    "text": "Having never heard of an arepa before, Katrina M. quickly introduced me to one on a drunken night. Prior to going into the adjacent Dino's, I was ordered a Reina Pepiada - a masa cake stuffed with a cold combination of chicken, mayo, avocado, and peas. Even in sober retrospect, that was a damn great meal.   Another karaoke excursion brought a large group of us back to I Love Arepas. Ordering a myriad of arepas and empanadas, my favorites were the Roasted Pork Leg/Butt (moist, flavorful without unnecessary frills) and the Garlic Shrimp (showcasing the masa in its lightness). However, the sauces make the arepas infinitely better. There were two: a creamy green that was mild, and a more concentrated green that added spice in all the right ways. My only disappointment was in the codfish arepa - salty, fishy, and an added upset to the booze I just ingested.   The best part about this place, other than the arepas? The price! I swear, for under five bucks per arepa, I am not conscious of my broke college finances. The price and the amazing food make I Love Arepas the content of my dreams for the past week, with the only way to cease them is to visit again.",

I really liked the arepas but there was sooooo much sauces in it.  The meats were practically soaked in sauces.

There is a whole world of South American cuisine that I didn't know existed up until recently. The Venezuelans and their affinity for this scrumptious maize dough have brought a smile to my face and taste buds. You know, if taste buds had faces. That would actually be kind of creepy if they did.   We came in a wandering from one World Famous Gold and Silver Pawn Shop, on our way to the Stratosphere, hungry for a snack. Arepas are perfect for a light lunch meal or snack, but only if you limit yourself to one. You'll be sorely tempted to have more. This eatery is marginally clean; there's a nice lady that comes around asking if she can wipe your tables or buss your trash. I wish water was available for self-serve. I was parched after walking in stupid shoes and would have liked snappier water refills.   All in all, this is a delicious stop just north of the Stratosphere, especially if you're looking for a more unique ethnic choice without all the flare and overdone nonsense of the Strip.",

The Yelp reviews were glowing and the pictures looked insane.  I knew immediately I would try the 7, which is chicken, Mayo, avocado and god knows what else. It was amazing. Then I tried the 12 which was beef, black beans and plantain. We also ordered a side of yucca root and fried plantains. The drink was a pineapple/mango Fresca. I honestly just found a new junk food favorite!!!! I'm so excited to return!!",

It was back several years ago when they first opened that I tried their arepas and wasn't too impressed at that time.   I had the pork butt arepa this time along with the cachapa. Both were quite amazing. I'm not a huge fan of the exterior of the arepa in general, but the pork butt was marinated to perfection and with the green sauce it went well together.   The cachapa I got was a bit undercooked, but, I donated it to my coworkers and they were quite blown away, given that it was their first time they had tasted anything like it. I'll definitely be back to try several of their items again, as their menu is now vast with so many options!",

The arepa crust has a perfect crunch and rich corn flavor - - but it is not a starch bomb - - it is a svelte, light, super tasty vehicle for some outrageous goodness inside.  The full, complex, combination of earthy beans, toothy shredded beef, and a touch of sweet plaintain, accented by the crumbly cheese is massively satisfying.   Fantastic balance of flavors, textures, and fine, fine ingredients, deftly assembled.  Most 'sandwich' places give you a big glob of starch with some scant tasty ingredients buried within;  some taco places actually give you precious little food;  but this arepa is a full-on powerhouse of ingredient excellence, in a light and delicious frame.",

For ppl who have never had them imagine a pancake made out of corn topped with melted cheese. So it might be a little too sweet for someone who's not used to the flavors.

Our group leans liberal so we had more vegetarians, gluten-free, vegan, non-dairy types onboard than is typical.   No problem, said Viva Las Arepas. They hooked us up meal after meal. They prepared the food and drove it to our location, set everything up and served our group buffet style. Then they cleaned up after themselves and took everything with them.   Our guests were over the moon for the breakfast arepas. And everyone was raving about all of the dinner options. They did a great job of mixing things up so that we weren't just eating arepas, arepas, arepas for 4 days.   They were great. We were very pleased with the price, the flavor, the service, the promptness and the good attitudes of the entire crew.   Would definitely recommend for an event again. Loved it!",

Two stars go away for one the price is way high for the amount of food, even high quality food has a price to amount metric and 6$ plus additions and tax brought it to 8$ plus, which brings me to the second star.  I was in a rush when I arrived and ordered the asada arepa, to which the very nice girl asked would you like avocado and cheese, to which I repsonded I'll have whatever comes on it, her response was I like it with avocado and cheese, Okay.  They added a buck fifty extra, and that is mostly on me, but I feel when you offer extra things let it be known they'll cost extra.  This is my third arepa joint, and this would rank second for taste and last for value, too expensive.  Washington D.C still has the best arepas I've tasted and half the price.",

We ordered 3 arepas: Reina Pepiada (chicken, avocado, mayo, cilantro), Garlic Shrimp, and Wood-fired Beef. Shrimp was bad, beef was a-ok. I only liked Reina Pepiada (which also happens to be their most popular item), but would have been better with a different bread. We also had fried plantain, which came SOAKED in oil. I've had it before elsewhere, it should not be.  Kudos to the cleanliness and the prices! Just not my cup-a-tea taste-wise.",

I didn't want to do anything too \"Vegasy\", so I avoided the strip and the fancy restaurants in casinos. I also didn't feel like paying an arm and a leg for each meal. Enter Viva Las Arepas. The arepas are fresh and flavorful. I tried the roasted pork and, after the first bite, my eyes rolled to the back of my head and I smiled euphorically. So good. So so so good. I wish I had more room in my belly to fit every arepa they made. The empanadas were amazing. And the platanos? Fried perfectly, like my mom makes them. Get the sugar cane and lime juice. You'll never want a regular lemonade again. The staff is super friendly and helpful. If you can't decide, they'll help you whittle your options down. If you're visiting Las Vegas and you want something a bit different, you MUST stop here!",

I had a 7 day stay in Vegas and I found this location on day 3 and after that I was there everyday for at least lunch or dinner. On my last day I had lunch there then returned to get something to have for my flight.   The food is made to order. Everything is authentic, fresh, and hot. The staff was more than nice to explain any questions about the food and they gave the best recommendations.   If you are a foodie, then this is a must stop location.   I will definitely put this on my must stop at again when I return to Vegas!!!",

    "text": "So me, J.V and Daniel met up at I Love Arepas after having a convo at work about Colombian food ( Daniel's family is Colombian).  I told them about I Love Arepas and we had decided to finally check it out, once we arrived, we realized its Venezuelan and not Colombian but Daniel said arepas is a Colombian dish also? Hmm okay...  Well, it was a very HOT day and since this place is just a stand with a few tables set up, we decided to sit at one of the tables and eat instead of in our cars.  We started with the fruit juices- sugar cane with lime for me, mango for Daniel and Tamarindo for JV.  We all thoroughly enjoyed our drinks, you can tell everything was freshly made. I thought my sugar cane/lime drink would be too sweet but it wasn't, it was PERFECT on this extremely hot day.  Food, we ordered almost everything on the menu..Arepas are like sandwiches with the patties made from cornmeal which is grilled then stuffed with meat, cheese and other delightful things...  Here's what we ordered: Roasted Pork Butt (Hot filling)- yummy! shredded pork similar to carnitas, had great flavor Shredded Chicken (Hot)- also very good, similar flavors to the pork butt Beef Tongue (Hot filling)- oh my, SO good, one of my favorites! tender, slightly spicy Honeycomb Tripe/Menudo (Hot)- another of my favorites in the hot filling category, this was the spiciest of all the arepas we tried. Again, full of flavor with the garlic and spices!  Cold fillings- Reina Pepiada- they said this was their most popular but I was not a fan.  There was just too much mayo going on with this one, I couldn't even eat it all.  It's similar to a chicken salad with avocado and green peas but umm, yeah, too much mayo... Garlic shrimp- this was BOMB, I mean seriously good. It was like having shrimp ceviche in a sandwich...this is a must have!  Empanadas- the guys loved the black bean and cheese, I got the shredded beef.  They loved it and said it tasted really fresh, mine was okay, seemed that my shredded beef had more filling than their black bean/cheese ones.  Hallacas- this alone would have me stopping by daily.  It's the most expensive item on their menu at $5 each but it's so worth it.  It's similar to a tamale with empanada filling wrapped in banana/plantain leaves and steamed.  For me, the cornmeal dough was SO yummy! It' reminded me of a Vietnamese dish very similar to it that's got ground pork and also steamed in banana leaf...this is a HELL yeah dish for me!  After we were done trying all the dishes, we were thirsty again so I ordered the Guava drink next and JV ordered the Guanabana (soursop).  Both drinks again were fresh and you could taste it!  This is a definite return for us, but next time, after the sun goes down or when the weather was cooler!",

It's kind of scary because it is Downtown, but I went around noon, so it wasn't too bad.  The arepas were good! I got the shredded beef. Beef was definitely spilling out of the bread pocket.

I love their food, especially the: pork butt arepas, grilled steak special, plantains, cheese cachapa (seriously, worthy of being a \"one last meal\") , guava and cheese pastelitos, fried yucca root, passion fruit drink, wood fired mixed grill, and so much more! The creamy cilantro sauce is amazing - I put it on everything.   The first time we went there it was just a little cart on the corner in front of Dino's - they have done so well and reinvested their profits into a lovely little restaurant with an outdoor seating area, and a really comfortable and nice atmosphere. They always remember us when we come in and are so friendly. It is so nice to see good people doing well!   Oh ya, did I mention, the food is amazing? Consistently fresh, hot, and delicious. If their mission was to make me a customer for life - mission accomplished.",

    "text": "Viva las.......Vegas. As for the arepas, well there's always pupusas.   I've tried the arepas once before when they were selling them from the little shack on Dino's parking lot and they were kinda good but nothing I would really get addicted to, so when I found myself in the shady neighborhood looking for other kind of addictions I decided to give arepas another try. Service is good, they were friendly and very patient with me while I read both menus one in English and the other one in Spanish, the one disadvantage of being bilingual, (or drunk) you read everything twice.  The new location is nice, spacious and clean, but the booths are kind of small you can literally take a bite off the persons arepa seating in front of you which could be good thing depending on who you're with, so if you're not interested at all in counting your companion cavities pick a table for more personal space. There's also a long communal table along the window with a view to a beautiful 7-11 and other independent entrepreneurs working around the area. you can eat and do some window shopping at the same time.   For the food I ordered the garlic shrimp and the pork butt arepas, the shrimp arepa was very good but the garlic flavor was very intense,(still present 5 hours later) and the pork butt was a little too salty and there's nothing I hate more than salty butt.  Still,  this is a very popular place and most people find the food here tasty and palatable, as for me I don't see myself waking up in the middle of the night craving arepas so if you see me late at night around the neighborhood, arepas is not what I'm looking for.   #clean #good service #ok prices",

The service is pretty fast and the line at one point was out the door.   I ordered the Garlic Shrimp Arepa (you can have it either hot or cold. I ordered it hot.) & the Pork Butt Arepa. Both were PACKED with flavor. They can be a little deceiving though. They're no bigger than a regular cheeseburger, but I found myself getting full fast! I ended up only eating half of both, then just picked at the insides. (the garlic shrimp was just too good to leave behind)  Even though the place is located in downtown LV, it was pretty clean and the bathrooms were well maintained.   I also noticed how friendly the associates were. Even though there was a pretty sizable line behind me while I was ordering, I never felt rushed and they were more than happy to make me something that was not on the menu. My little wanted rice with vegetables (thats on the menu) with a fried egg (not on the menu).   The restaurant itself is a waaaays away from my place, but I don't think that would stop us from popping in from time to time.",

I had spoken with the owner earlier in the week and he told me that the arepa dough is made with milk, but that he would be happy to make me a special vegan one if I was willing to wait for it.  Well, Saturday night, drunk and hungry, I was more than willing to wait.  And I am so glad that I did! He made me a gorgeous arepa filled with black beans, and topped with freshly sliced avocado and tomato.  I have not stopped thinking about this food since I finished eating it, and I will definitely be going back soon.  The arepa dough was crispy from the grill on the outside (and btw, they cleaned the grill and made mine off to the side of all the other ones!) and almost fluffy on the inside.  The fillings were so fresh and tasty too! Every bite put a smile on my face.    As a regular at Dino's, I am so thrilled to have a late night, vegan friendly food option to help me soak up the booze! And I really appreciate how super friendly and accommodating the folks who run the place were.    My carnivorous friends went crazy over their non-vegan pork arepas too... and in fact everyone I saw get food there seemed pleased.  If you've never tried arepas you have been missing out!",

The price for each arepa is a little steep, especially if you add cheese and avocado, but it's well worth the price. The size is a good portion. My first time, I ate 2 and was too full. The carne asada and roasted pork butt are delicious. Extremely flavorful. The corn bun just melts in your mouth, while the meat is seasoned and juicy. The empanadas are great also. Nice hidden gem on the strip/yet off the strip.",

It was my first time having arepas and I got the hot Lengua Arepas (tongue)  and a cold Reina Pepiada (chicken avocado--**their most raved about arepas**).  Get the green chile sauces..it enhances the taste. They both come in the grainy textured corn bun (similar to an english muffin).  The Lengua Arepas is a little messy because of the oiliness of the sauce. I actually liked the Reina Pepiada more because of the fusion of the cilantro, mayo, and avocado marinating the shredded chicken.  You have to at least try it out once.",

When my order was ready someone else walked up at took it to their table thinking it was their order. After the mistaken patron took my food, he sat with his girl, handled the food for few minutes, opened the wrapping and finally realized it was the wrong order he took it back up to the counter to explain he had the wrong order. I watched as the lady at the counter decided to fix what the mistaken patron has done and serve the tainted, already handled by strangers, food and serve it to us. F**king gross!!! I will never go back and recommend you pay attention to how your food is handled here. That was definitely against the rules of proper food handling and sale. It's sad because I really liked this place",

I had the #4 with cheese, my friend had the #3 and my husband had the #12 and a side of plantains.  We were not disappointed, the sauces were amazing also! I could have just drank them straight from the bottle.  They stuff the arepas full of meat and they are dripping with meaty goodness! People complaining about too much sauce or juices, don't know what they are talking about.  Who wants dried meat?  Not me!  If I wasn't bursting at the seams after my meal, I would have gotten more to go.  I considered driving by and getting some on my way to the airport because it probably could have helped my hangover.  I didn't think the neighborhood was that bad, but I'm not usually deterred by a few run down buildings or some graffiti.  I will be back and I'll be dreaming of it until I can have it again.",

    "text": "I'm glad this local business is thriving, but I was disappointed with my experience. I found the wood fired chicken and shredded beef lacking in any discernible flavor other than salt. And the salt ruined the food for me. I enjoyed the sauce/additions on both, but when I am eating meat, I don't want to feel like a dish NEEDS the sauce. These arepas did. In addition, the texture of both was also very....mushy. Based on the overwhelmingly positive reviews, I will give them another chance and hope that I caught them on a bad day.  I ate arepas made by hand years ago and they were outstanding. So I know I like arepas.  I realize it is not fair to compare homemade preparation with a fast food preparation, but I really wanted (and expected) to love the product at Viva Las Arepas. I didn't expect it to taste like homemade, but I did expect better than what they delivered. It remains to be seen if this was a bad day, or just not the business for me. I will go back and try the vegetarian option to find out.   I'm not giving up on you, VLA!",

    "text": "Viva Las Vegas? Nah, Viva Las Arepas!  A couple of buddies told me about this place and how they have cheap yet satisfying food. My cousin and I took a trip on a Tuesday afternoon for some grub. The restaurant is located on the left when going north on Las Vegas Blvd on Wyoming. The place is quite clean and large with tables and booths.    There are pictures of their food items posted all over the restaurant. Those helped with familiarizing myself with their food items but didn't help in the sense for me to choose what I wanted since they all looked so delicious!   After reading Yelp reviews and getting a recommendation from the girl behind the counter, my cousin and I decided to get the Reina Pepiada. In between two warm cornbread slices, there was shredded chicken breast with avocado, mayo, cilantro and green peas. The consistency was almost like a chicken salad. I was a little thrown off with how warm the cornbread slices were and how cold the chicken concoction was. But I got past this in a hot minute and chowed down happily.   We were given a red bottle (spicy hot sauce) and a yellow bottle (mild hot sauce) to have with our arepas. A little sprinkle of some hot sauce (I like the spicy but the mild is good, too) with each bite is key to elevate flavors. And a side note, don't be fooled by the \"small\" size of the arepa. This little baby fills you up. I walked out of there overly stuffed.   To wash it all down, we each ordered a fruit juice. What's cool is that they let you try samples before you buy one. My cousin ordered the guava juice and I ordered the mango. I expected the juices to be a little thick, but they weren't. Very refreshing and not too sweet. Doesn't taste artificial. I think I will end up craving their mango juice during the hot Vegas summer months.  If you find a silly Asian girl chanting \"long live the arepa!\" here, that's me. If you find a female Asian bum on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming with a sign that says \"will work for arepas,\" that's me, too. That being said, you all get the point. Go get some arepas!",

They should price that at $1.75.  $6 for Arepas would be o.k. if it was bigger..  They should price these around $4.25  $3 for small Empanadas..  They should price these for about $2.25  $3.50 for fruit drinks..  They should price these for about $2.50  All my friends agreed that the prices were a bit too high and probably won't be back.  If you purchased one Arepa, one Empanada, one order of fries and a fruit drink, the grand total would be about $17 with tax.  But at least the food was decent.",

    "text": "My friend randomly said how he always passes by a place called \"I Love Arepas\" on his way to work.  After seeing Bobby Flay's Throwdown, I saw those two Venezuelan sisters and knew I needed to try those one day.  I took it as a sign and couldn't say no to going!   Drive there and find it is TINY! I want to say it's about 10 by 10 feet with a handful of bar type chairs by the window and a couple tables by the street. It's definitely not a restaurant. More of a food truck slash stand.  If you haven't guessed, it's kind of \"ghetto\" being on LV BLVD across the Olympic Gardens Gentlemen's Club haha.  We were the only ones there. I took it as a bad sign because the chef looked like he was in a bad mood and his up selling techniques made him seem a little unappreciative of having customers by his tone of voice.  The menu is small, everything is under $5.00 being a sort of tamale you can only order to go. The Arepas are about $3-$4 depending on the meat or style and are definitely worth the price. They aren't HUGE so don't expect something with huge portions, but the flavor and specialness of the item is there.   We ordered the #1 which was beef and added mozzarella for $0.50.  I asked for it to go and the chef suggested we eat it there and we'd enjoy it more.  It was DELICIOUS!  An arepa is a masa \"patty\" that gets grilled on both sides so they're crispy, and filled with different meats, veggies, sauces , ect.  The masa is crisp on the outside, soft on the inside, and the fillings are so good!  I described it as a cross between a tamale, a sopa, and a torta.  There are different hot or cold fillings.  They also have drinks, empanadas, and snacks.  After having it I ordered some to go for my friend and they loved it as well.  Overall love the place. Wish the Gentlemen working was nicer, but every one has those days. The food was great and that's all that matters.  Btw, they serve with two sauces, a creamy green and a spicy/sour red and are both SO GOOD. They also give you sauce to go.  Highly recommend!",

    "text": "So, they're basically like tortas, but the \"bread\" part is less like your typical starchy bread. The bread is like an english muffin (in this case I'm going to make it up and say it's more like a Venezuelan muffin than an english muffin) with a soft corn tortilla texture or flavor (because that is what it probably is).  I ordered the WOOD FIRED CHICKEN, PORK BUTT, CARNE ASADA arepa. You know they hold True to their word when they say wood fired when you can see the wood that they cook the meat in stacked in an area where you can see. Also, you can taste that delicious smoky, wood fired flavor in your meats. I'm no wood connoisseur so unfortunately I can't tell you what type of wood they used based on the flavor of the meats. I also don't eat wood on a regular (insert laughing emoji here).  You get the option of adding cheese ($0.50) and avocado ($0.99) for an extra charge. Based on experience, unless you're really lactose intolerant, I suggest you DEFINITELY get cheese. If you're feeling adventurous, add that avocado (and then pat yourself on the back for being so damn awesome). Also, add that green sauce. It'll take your mouth on a journey it has never been before. Put all that together, and what do you call that? A fiesta.  If you're on a date (like I was), I would say, pick THREE different arepas, or if you're the type who can eat food the size of a water buffalo, I would pick one of everything, and then...SHARE!   REASONS WHY YOU SHOULD SHARE:  1.) It makes more strategic sense to be able to conquer every food item on the menu in one shot 2.) Sharing is caring (DUH!) 3.) It makes a perfect talking point during your date (\"What's your favorite?\" \"Oh, I like the wood fired chicken.\" \"Oh I like the wood fired chicken too.\")  4.) Diversifying is important 5.) Again, variety people. VARIETY! 6.) It's fun  #YoureWelcome",

    "text": "WOW! got the asada Arepa with avocado and cheese. Very flavorful with a bold Smokey taste. The texture of the bread was slightly crispy on the outside but the bite is so soft and melts in your mouth! I also tried the chicken empanada. Probably the most satisfying empanada i've ever had. The chicken itself Had a very rich flavor of different spices and the shell is not hard. also, a soft melt in your mouth texture. I would definitely recommend to families and friends especially from out of town visiting. I will be coming back to try more of what the menu has to offer! Great customer service clean and affordable place to dine in  they also provide different kinds of dinner entres if u are interested. Note that Arepas have a hearty stuff and they are 5.50ea. excluding add ons. (Cheese, avo, etc.) ENJOY!",

    "text": "I did some wondering around after having some gelato from Art of Flavors and noticed Viva Las Arepas right next door. It was spacious but there weren't a lot of people inside. The menu seemed like there was a lot of going on, don't know when I'll be back again and had to get it right, so I had to rely on the Yelp app to see what everyone was getting.   The Reina Pepiada was mentioned pretty frequently.  I wasn't sure if it was something I should eat or someone I should meet. It was an arepas filled with a mixture of chicken breast, avocado, mayo and cilantro. It wasn't that big and didn't taste that amazing on it's own. It was too much avocado and mayo and not enough chicken for me but it was only about $5 and it was enjoyable after dumping whatever sauces were inside of the red and yellow containers.    They did lack customer service. I explained that this was my first time here and if they had any recommendations or customer favorites. They could not help me with that and seemed rude about it, even went back to whatever they were doing before I asked for a menu, sat in the corner, and brought out the Yelp app. I didn't feel as welcomed as Art of Flavors felt like I should go back there. Customer service is big for me, it's not that hard to be friendly, courteous, and give your attention to paying customers.  The rest of their food do sound and look good, from the reviews and pictures posted, and I'm sure they're well deserving of the 2 star I gave them but since the food from what I had was just OK and the service wasn't to my liking there is no way I can give them a 3 star, OK, to something I was not OK with. Another visit will happen but not anytime soon.",

We only tried arepas, but their menu is extensive and there are so many different menu items to choose from, I look forward to trying empanadas as well during my next visit.   The texture was great and I loved the flavor combinations. The salsas were really great and spicy to boot. I was hoping they would be a little cheaper, but I didn't feel like they were too expensive, just more than I was expecting.   I look forward to coming back again really soon.",

He mentioned that all the meat is wood fired so the meat has a mesquite tast to it. Arepa is a ground maize flatbread sandwich. I saw it as a tamale sandwich. My bf and I had the Reina Peplada #7 which consists of chicken breast, avocado, and cilantro. I added some of the creamy cilantro sauce and it was definitely a party in my mouth. It's a cold sandwich so it tasted great while we waited for my hot arepas to cool down. I ordered the Perico #11 which has scrambled eggs, tomato, onion, and ham.. cuz breakfast is good any time of the day!  We also tried the shredded beef empanada and coconut and cheese pastelito. The pastelito was pretty sweet and it was a lot better than I expected. We were pretty full after sharing these four items. I also had a mango juice to help wash down all the delicious goodness. A good part of all this food is that it's gluten free, fresh, and handmade to order.   The next time I decide to shop at the North Outlets I'm definitely going to come back here for more arepas!",

The neighborhood around this place is dirty and sketchy, but inside the restaurant it was a lot nicer than I expected. I was expecting it to be a hole in the wall, but it was situated more like a modern fast food joint. I ordered the pork butt arepa with avocado, cheese and fried plantains with a soda. My Mom just got their sugar cane and lime drink, she was going to split my food with me. My Dad got the cold chicken with cilantro mayo arepa (I forgot what it was called) with fried yuca and chicharrones and a mango juice drink. We got the drinks first. The sugar lime drink was ok, it needed more lime and was kinda watered down. My Dad's mango drink was way better, one of the best things we had here. It wasn't too thick or sweet. It was almost creamy and had a mild mango flavor. I wish I had ordered it.   My arepa was ok, I expected the pork meat to be like carnitas, but it was more like average pulled pork. I tried my Dad's arepa and it was a lot better, I liked the cilantro mayo. The sauces they gave us were good, one was spicy and the other was a cilantro sauce. They enhanced the flavor of my arepa, made it better. Our sides were the best out of everything. The plantains were sweet and a little crispy. The yuca and chicharrones were great and even better with that cilantro sauce. The yuca was crispy and starchy. The chicharrones were a bit dry, but they were meaty and of course great with the cilantro sauce. I was just kinda disappointed in my arepa, I think next time I'll try their grilled meats instead, if I come again.",

Between the 2 times I've been here, I've had the garlic shrimp, shredded beef, pepiada, and fried plantains. Out of all of these, the fried plantains stand out more than the sandwiches. The fillings for the arepas are decent, but they're just missing something...like maybe plantains?! I think this is maybe why I liked Rika so much- they had plantains in the sandwich! The shredded beef would be taken to a whole new level with this simple addition. The two sauces I was offered were good, especially the spicy green one, but once again I liked the 2 sauces from Rika better.   This place will do for a quick fix for an arepa craving, but to really curb my craving I'll need to go on a food truck hunt!",

Small corner place in a tiny little plaza on Las Vegas Blvd in the down town area. Booths on the sides of the restaraunt & tables in the center.   You order your food & then you pick up your food when they call your name. There are two different digital menus.. one in English & one in Spanish.  CARNE ASADA AREPAS $5.50 - comes w/ lettuce & tomato... we also added avocado for $0.99 more. The meat was very tender & the maize dough was soft yet grainy... it was definitely new for me but good. Reminds me of a tamale made differently. Ahhahaaa   CHICKEN EMPANADA $3 - hot & good like a chicken dumpling deed fried w/ dough shell rather than wonton shell  BEEF EMPANADA $3   GUAVA PASTELITOS $3 - this was like an empanada shaped differently & it was filled w/ guava chunks & cheese. Very interesting combination but it worked  COCONUT PASTELITOS $3 - wasn't too fond of this since I'm not a big fan of shredded coconuts that is used for desserts because it gets wayyy to fake kinda sweet taste, but this also had cheese in it so it wasn't toooo sweet.",

After a yummy experience from an arepas foodtruck, we got garlic shrimp arepa, pork butt arepa with cheese, Reina Pepiada arepa, wood fire chicken arepa and fried plantains. They have more options here compared to the foodtruck which is not surprising. The prices are about the same. But the arepa itself is less toasted and is heavier than the foodtruck version. The cilantro sauce is equally as good, this place's spicy/red sauce is spicier. I had to try their guanabana juice to compare it to what I had when I was a kid.   Garlic Shrimp Arepa: No tomatoes or veggies, just straight up garlic shrimp. I liked this a lot especially with the cilantro sauce which elevates the garlic flavor of the shrimp.  5/5  Roasted Pork Butt: Comes with tomato slices. Add cheese. In case you didn't know, pork butt = pork shoulder and not the actual butt of a pig. Tasty pork. Both the spicy and cilantro sauce work well with this. 4/5  Reina Pepiada Arepa: Cold chicken with mayo, avocado and cilantro. Tastes just like the one from the arepas foodtruck. A much better version of a chicken salad. 5/5  Wood Fire Chicken Arepa: Really flavorful chicken with tomato, onions and lettuce. 4/5  Fried Plantains: I love this stuff. My mom would fry some plantains for me as a snack when I was a kid. So simple and easy to make yet it tastes so good. The natural sweetness of the plantains come out when you fry them in high temperatures. Eventhough they could have gotten rid of the excess oil, I still like these things. 5/5  Guanabana: AKA soursop juice and in Filipino, guyabano. This tastes like concentrate mixed with lots of sugar and water. I couldn't taste soursop. 3/5  After that meal, we headed next door for dessert. After dessert, I decided to come back here so I can try the chicharron with fried yucca. Shawn tapped out as I was enjoying chicharron and yucca. All he said to me was \"I can't believe how you're still eating.\"  Chicharron with Fried Yucca: The chicharron wasn't the same crispy fatty pork I was excpeting. The yucca was good with the cilantro sauce though. It was as if I was eating garlic fries. Yum! 4/5",

The owner had stepped out when i arrived around 1pm on a Sunday, so i was left trying to order from the cook who doesn't know a lick of english (hello border patrol). He didn't understand \"#1 and #2 to go, but he did say \"let me call my boss\" so he calls his boss who didn't answer the phone. Five awkward minutes later, i yell out \"uno y dos and adios\" and the cooking got underway finally. Oddly enough, he asked in English if I wanted cheese. Both the shredded chicken and beef were tasty, but the edge goes to the beef, although both needed more peppers and onions and the promised garlic wasn't too prevalent. The chicken was kind of mushy too. The cornmeal pancakes were the best part, so i will probably focus more on veggie stuffings which would let those shine through more. The hot green sauce had much more flavor than other green buttermilky stuff, but gotta use that lightly. The cheese was a good addition for 50 cents.",

I hit this place up at least every other night and usually drag suburban friends along too, to show them how we roll in downtown. The Arepas are fuggin amazing! Felix the boss man is the friendliest guy will meet downtown too! You can have 2 of these sandwiches and you'll be totally stuffed. Sitting outside of the little Arepas shop is the perfect place to \"people stare\". You can watch the escorts,homeless,drunk tourists,out of country tourists,rich people and crazy people all walk by while you sit and stare. Once done you can walk 20 steps to either Dinos for Karaoke and the strongest and cheapest drinks in Vegas or across the street to Olympic Gardens to get your \"perv\" on tipping the ladies. If you are ever around the Stratosphere or downtown, definitely make the very short trip to the corner of Wyoming and Las Vegas blvd. You WON'T be dissapointed",

The Hallacas (sp) was delicious, I'm not a fan of raisins and olives so that was my only complaint about it and that it came pre-made so I couldn't get them removed. However, despite my distaste for raisins and olives, it still came out pretty good. The breading they used for the Arepas though was outstanding, I actually could not get enough of that which is why I loved the #1 but also the #7. The #7 was a little more creamier than I thought but the breading had me finish the whole thing. The only real negative about the place as other people have mentioned is that if you go during the summer be prepared to sweat while you eat or at least wait for your food to be finished. However, it's a trade off since melting like Frosty the Snowman will always be tolerable if I can watch a priest, stripper, crackhead, retirees, and a man dressed as Catwoman walk by. (Yes, I typed that correctly, a man dressed as Catwoman, entertaining to say the least) This corner never fails to disappoint.",

We were slightly hesistant about the Reina Pepiadas first because of the mayo, but the mayo actually added an extra dimention of richness to each bite.  Each arepa was bursting with flavor.  I would recommend asking for your arepas to be grilled slightly longer to give the outer shell an extra crispy texture.  We arrived at 11AM and by the time we were done with our food at 11:30AM, there was already a decent line forming.  Good food is worth the wait...and the price is great!  Definitely recommend!",

The chicken with avocado and shredded beef...simple, wonderful. Next time, I'll skip the cheese on the chicken (cheese slice just sits there between warm corn arepa and cool filling, and for me, would have been better off without).  On top of the great food, the owner went above and beyond. He called a taxi for us and walked outside a few times to make sure we'd get the cab; what a nice, nice man.

We ordered the garlic shrimp arepas and a few empanadas - cheese, cheese & bean, and cheese & guava - along with fried plantains and the Agua De Panela to drink. The taste of everything was fresh and simple, the multiple sauces, including a cilantro/mayo, a perfect addition. I was expecting the food to be heavy and greasy but it wasn't!  With items from $2-$4 and a bright, clean interior, you really can't go wrong. Felix, one of the owners, was very nice and obviously takes pride in his food.   I always enjoy a place were we can try something a little different that my six-year-old will like too. This fits the bill and it is within walking distance of my house!

On our last visit I tried the cachapa for the first time, which was like a really yummy, salty-sweet, corn and cheese pancake or crepe. I am kind of craving one right now.

The only downside was the section of town it was in. I actually decided to pass on by at first and not eat there...but just knew I would regret it. It was very good...don't let the location scare you. The inside is very clean.",

No, it's not~ It's Dry chicken, Dry pork, and Dry beef~ F'ing Dry~ What a D'bag to serve such poorly prepared food~ Sad~ In a third world roll~ I'm so cool because I love it! No, I'm not~ Dry protein in a third world tube roll is worse than a TV Dinner~ Because you paid for it, and told your friends how good it was~ Oh, and the Gelato shop next door?  He owns that too~ But not a feature of VLA~ Do your self a favor and check Luv-It around the corner~ It may appeal more to an honest palate~ And skip the overcooked third world sammich shop~ Lot's of good, honest food in Vegas, even in that neighborhood~ Just makes me sad I spent my money there~ Just think, \"Dry\"~",

They had recently moved across the street from their previous location, which is now a hot dog stand, when I first visited. I had to call and ask them where their new location is.  When we got there we ordered all the popular items listed on yelp. The food was decent but not amazing.  Their service is great though. So for that I give them 3 stars. My experience wasn't bad nor has it been amazing that I would want to go back for more.  If you've never had arepas, this is a perfect place to try them out!",

My favorite is the fire wood beef one, the beef was super tender and flavorful! Make sure you try them with the two sauces (not sure what they are called), the creamy green one is very good!

We tried 4 or 5 different kinds; the pabellon was absolutely delish; the cachapa (corn and cheese) was surprisingly nice and delicate. I thought I'd like the reina pepiada best but actually I wasn't crazy about the taste - kind of tart and not much body or complexity to the flavor. Note that 1 arepas is not quite enough for a full meal for a grown adult, so order 2 if you're hungry (about $6/each). The up-side is that you can easily try 2 kinds, or just order 1 for a snack. We also tried the beef empenada which was nice (different than mexican empendas), and the fried plantains, which sweeter and softer than say Cuban plantains - almost like supermarket bananas - but still tasty.  It's far enough from the strip that parking isn't a hassle, and the service was fine.",

    "text": "So Felix has moved the business to a brick and mortar store just a few stores down.  The little kiosk in the parking lot next to the diner or whatever is still open, but he manages both places now.  It took two years from when he first set up store at the kiosk til he opened up his sit down restaurant.  That's quite respectable.  I could tell that Felix was still working out the kinks, but despite a long day of managing and teaching his employees, he still provided us superior service.    The upgrade to five stars is not only for the service, but I am now very impressed with the reina pepiada.  Often times when I get it, there is a lack of flavor.  This is thus far the best one I've tasted in the States.  Also cachapas con queso, which was my second favorite thing in the meal.  The cornmeal shell was actually sweet, and I really like sweet and savory combinations.  Also we got the tostones (but they called it something else) and the yucca fries.  The tostones were a bit over fried, but at least my husband was ok with that.  The cachapas were initially over fried, so Felix brought out a second one on the house.    I really like supporting small businesses, esp ones that provide such good food and service like this one.  We will definitely be back to try everything on the menu!",

We ordered a Reina Pepiada, carne asada arepa, plantains, side salad, mango juiceI and parchita. I'm not exagerrating when I say that all of the food was delicious and beyond our expectations! The Reina Pepiada was creamy and tangy as well as the salad.  The plantains were hot, crispy, and perfectly sweet.  And if you have to choose what to drink I highly suggest parchita, especially if you like tangy refreshing drinks.   On top of serving fabulous food,  the cashier was very helpful, attentive, and let us try their specialty drinks.  He even went out of his way to bring our food out to our table. The price of the food was very reasonable ($26 for all of the food mentioned above). This is great if you're in Vegas and trying to stay within budget because we all know how expensive Vegas can be.  Ultimately, the food and service were deserving of the 5 stars.  We will definitely be back before the weekend is over!",

Our arepas averaged about $5-6/each. We got a wood fired chicken, pork butt, wood fired beef, and an order of plantains. The wood fired beef was super tasty, while the pork and chicken were a bit salty.  I've never had arepas before, but I became a huge fan after trying these. The \"bun\" was made of a cornmeal that was grilled, and it was stuffed with a LOT of tasty meats/veggies. The Venezuelan hamburger was filling and also came with two sauces. The pork and chicken arepas got a little wet from the juices inside and started to fall apart towards the end, but were still good nonetheless. The plantains were spot on; warm, toasty, sweet, and delicious.   I'd definitely come back and recommend this restaurant to anyone in the area.

I was tempted to order more...but this order actually filled me up. I'm definitely going back. Take a look around the dining area for the different pictures of the meals offered on the menu. My friend had the fries too, which I took a couple, while he wasn't looking. Fries are just so-so. I'll order the fried plantains next time for a side. They looked a lot tastier.

We came on a Friday night and I was surprised to only see a few people eating here. Maybe I thought they would be busier because it's a Friday and there Fairly close to downtown but I think everyone was next door at Art of flavors. The warm bright colors make you feel welcome instantly. I knew I wanted an arepa and my guy had never heard of the please do went with a chicken plate. The pork on the pork butt arepa was succulent and juicy. Paired well with the cilantro garlic sauce. The plantains themselves were slightly mushy and soft. I guess I was expecting more of a crispy exterior. They still were buttery warm and comforting. I didn't mind at all. The chicken plate he orders came with 3 pieces of chicken thighs with 2 sides. He went with rice and beans. The chicken itself had a good seasoning in the outside and a crispy char from the open fire. It was a little dark but I like my meat cooked that way anyway. To some it might seemed burnt. Overall the food was pretty good and the hot sauce they gave was really good. Paired well with all the flavors. I would definitely come back and try some more arepas.",

I'm pretty sure there is egg and/or dairy in that bread. (their was an arepa truck in town, they had a labeled vegan and when I asked they told me the ingredients!)   Anyway, I'm not really a fan of this oily greasy weird bread nor really any bread in general. I guess this just is not the place for me!  I have problems with businesses that seem whishy-washy when the actual owner can't spout off the ingredients off the top of his head and just says \"get the vegetarian, get the vegetarian.\"   The two times we have been here the place is empty but the service is slow yet very frantic.  Can't say we didn't try.",

The arepas are awesome, empanadas and all of their sides are all inexpensive - you will have a hard time figuring out what to choose. When you have political leaders with homes in Anthem Country Club driving all the way to a shady part of the Strip, it says volumes about how spectacular of an experience this place is. Grab an Inca Cola and enjoy - hard to make a bad choice off of their menu. Very affordable. Go before it gets later in the evening as the local sketchy crowd is not out just yet. Hope they expand to Henderson",

Each arepa is around $6 so it's not on the cheap side, but it was worth every penny.  Our favorite was the corn and cheese plate (not sure if it actually is an arepa) and the chicken and avocado mix one. We ordered 6 dishes in total and devoured everything.  One thing I wish they offered was a spicier sauce (I think I was in the King Taco mode) but honestly, the creamy and salsa-y sauce they offered were amazing.   Tacos el Gordo was always at the top of my book, but I think it was just topped by Viva Las Arepas.",

I ordered a cachapa (a corn pancake folded in half and filled with cheese) and added their Pulled pork butt with a side of yuca fries. All of this was just under $12 and provided enough food that I took half home (even after sharing the yuca with my hungry nine month old son).   I've never had a cachapa before and have nothing to compare it to. Nor have I had Venezuelan pork. But both were everything I was hoping they'd be and more! The corn Pancake was super moist and the flavor of corn came right through. The layer of cheese was very thick, very melted and very gooey - perfect! And the Pulled pork? Shredded, tender and covered in a sweet sauce (it reminded me of a BBQ sauce).   The yuca fries were thick and unevenly cut -crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside. They were mildly salted and definitely needed their cilantro sauce. But they were quite nice!   I can't wait to go back and bring my husband and anyone else that visits us! I have to say that I'm so in love with what I ordered the first time that it will be hard to try something new...but maybe another meat or sweet plantains to share??",

Highly recommend the chicken and probably second would be the pulled pork. The chicken has a smoke flavor and is marinated or basted in a pretty great sauce. Also highly recommend the green sauce. They have 2 and one is spicy -I stayed away from that one.   Another concern I know I have when it's clear food is authentic is how sanitary the kitchen is. It seems the best tasting foods come from suspect kitchens - not here. They have an A rating from the food/health inspectors.",

We each could have done with only one I ended up leaving half of each sandwich that I picked because I was so full. We also got the passion fruit juice and that was superb, perfectly complimented the arepas. The creamy green sauce was the bomb! It's like a mix of creamy avocado and salsa verde. I kind of want to put that sauce on everything in my life.",

There is not a single item on the menu that is less rhan outstanding. The empanada is another delicious treat not to be missed. Of course you will need a tasty beverage to accompany your meal. Try the passion fruit juice, quite tasty. If you are downtown or headed out for an evening on the Strip swing by and grab a bite to eat. I assure you you will be glad you took my advice.

I've been to really good Venezuelan/Colombian places on the East Coast, and this is the closest one here.  In the West Coast, this would be close to Amara Coffee in Pasadena, CA.  The cachapa with cheese is a great vegetarian option, and it's very filling.  I loved the tequenos, they're big and juicy.  I highly recommend the tequenos if you have never had Venezuelan food, it's a safe bet, and also vegetarian.  The passion fruit juice was a bit too sweet for me, but that's pretty much how they make it in Venezuela, so they stayed True to the recipe.  I liked the plantains with cream, but I wouldn't order them again, as the cream tasted Salvadorian to me.  I liked that they have other stuff, and not just arepas, because for people who know arepas, it is really hard to find a perfect one, and there are so many types that it is very subjective.  The empanada with chese was great, although it was a bit thick and not toasted enough.  The size is great if you want to have an inexpensive light breakfast.  I think the prices are fine, but I'm used to LA prices.  I will definitely come back when I'm in town, depite their sketch location.  I understand why they have so many good reviews, the quality of the food was great all around.  Lastly, if you're adventurous, try the garlic-parsley sauce, and drizzle it on the items that you ordered for an extra punch.",

So I finally gave in and told my bf and parents that we should go have lunch there. So we did!  We ordered 2 wood fire beef with cheese, 2 shredded beef with cheese, 1 order of fried plantains, 2 orders of cheese empanadas, a passion fruit juice and a pineapple juice. THEY WERE AMAZEBALLS!!!! Everything came out hot and fresh. They weren't as big as I thought they would be though, so it's definitely an awesome spot to have an afternoon bite!  Customer service is awesome and the place is clean! I was so glad we made it in literally 5mins before the lunch rush.  I would definitely go back again!",

I understand that this is a hole in the wall joint, and I'm all for that, but if the person taking my order cannot even understand English enough to take my order, we have a problem. The girl clearly was not competent enough to take our order. She kept trying to flash her smile, but that's just not going to get our food ordered. I had to ask for the manager twice. Pretty sad. Kind of ruined her whole vibe of this place.  Also, I have read other reviews which state that it is dirty inside lately and I would have to agree. Why is no one dusting off the tables and wiping down the chairs? While this place was on my mind this morning as I had a craving, I can say that I probably will not be coming here when that craving hits in the future...   I've been here a number of times over the years.  This is an easy get in, get your food, get out place.  It would be awesome if they had more than one vegan option, but I will take it nonetheless. The black bean and guac is absolutely delicious!  I do wish they had more salsas that were vegan. And maybe even more sides. But hey, let's stick to what the plus sides are here. This is an authentic Arepas hole in the wall joint with a super small menu and low prices.  The service is always friendly. And you see them making your food.  When the craving for in arepa hits, this is my one spot in town!",

The reina pepiada and wood fired beef arepas are so delicious and flavorful, and if that wasn't enough go for the fried yuca and chicharrones. The passionfruit and sugarcane w/ lime drinks are delicious and great for balancing off the rest of the meal. The guy at the register is friendly and cool, great service.",

I have a friend whose wife makes fresh arepas for him but i never knew exactly what they were until now! Talk about one of the most delicious morsels i have ever had!!!! My favorite is definitely the shrimp arepa which comes with buttery garlicky yumminess everywhere! I dont know what kind of food sorcery is going on in that kitchen but i am sooooo down! Another fav is the shredded beef! These people are not stingy at all with the meats! Just get one and you will be full and happy! The sauces are a must try as well. We have also tried the roasted pork arepa which is also delicious! My fav sauce is def the hotter one. Not too hot but the right amount of kick to where you will want to douse your arepa with more. Ive also has the #7 which is the chicken with avo. I didnt like this one as much as the others but its ok since their menu is so extensive. I will be going back here because the rest of the menu definitely needs my attention!",

    "text": "I have been coming here, to this specific location, for a few years now and I'm sad to say that it is not what it once was. If I had reviewed this place 4 or 5 years ago, 5 stars all around. But now, obviously, not so much.   Some of the staff has moved to their second location, too. This includes Alex, who was always the cashier. She was always so sweet and smiling! And totally on top of things. I miss her! :(   The last time I went in, the new (to me) younger guy at the counter gave away my takeout order last time. $35+ worth of food. 3 arepas and an order of yucca with chicharron. He didn't realize it until 15 minutes later and I had to wait around longer for my order. Not even an apology (because I don't have a life or to go back to work or anything, right?) and the food was meh. He was pushy and borderline rude, but in that weird, polite way.   The wood fired beef was oily, the shredded beef was on point as usual, as was the pabellon with no cheese. However, the yucca fries with chicharron are usually a highlight for me but were a disappointment. They used to give you a medium sized, rectangular box full of big, juicy fried pieces of meat and yucca. Now, the box is half that size but the same price with the yucca and chicharron declining in size as well. For $6.99??? I felt ripped off when I cracked the box open only to find that it was my side and not my single arepa.. womp womp.  I'm gonna check out the second location and even though I don't really want to come back here, I probably will. Hopefully I will be able to bump this place up in stars again.",

I ordered the chicken arepa and the plantains. The chicken is dripping from all of the juices. It's super flavorful and super messy. The sauce that they serve with it isn't necessary, but it's definitely great! The sauce kicks up the heat a bit, which I appreciate.  The plantains were about as addictive as potato chips. They were nice and salty and just the right texture.   The prices are pretty spot on. I only needed one arepa and the plantains. For $10, you can get plenty of food.  Check it out for something different.",

I have tried nearly every single menu item, sides and sweets included, and not one single item has disappointed me. I've gotten to the point of trying things just to see if I can be disappointed with an offering and nope, not close. I have liked every item and this is impressive.  The location is situated on the edge of downtown and is perfect for a grab and go meal or a casual sit down experience. I only wish the best for Viva Las Arepas.",

I've never had arepas before, but it's a weird mix between a taco and slider inside of a crumbly white corn bun. The bun to me is what really separates it from anything else. It's like cornbread, texture wise with not much taste. Wasn't exactly my favorite part of the meal. It did have a good crunch from them coming on the griddle though.   The filing is very similar to tacos. We got the wood fire beef (#1) which is like diced beef, pork belly (#4?), and chicken (#7). The best was the beef. The pork belly reminded me of frozen pre made pulled pork with heavy sauce. The chicken was way too over sauced and the sauce was just creamy, no flavor.  The food also came with two sauce, a spicy sauce, and the same sauce they used with the chicken arepa. The spicy sauce was very forgettable, hardly any spice. The cream sauce way actually decent and tasted better in smaller doses then flooded with chicken.   Overall this was not my favorite experience, but I realize it maybe more sure to my taste buds than anything they did.",

I was game for trying something new and never had an arepa before. We ordered the shredded beef and pabellon per recommendation. The arepas were good and very flavorful. They give you two different sauces. One is extremely spicy. The other is some kind of cilantro mayo concoction, but it works and is super tasty!   The reason for the low rating is the poor customer service. No greeting and no smiles. I had a coupon from a book I got at Costco and as soon as I showed it, the cashier immediately turned it down. He was kind of rude and unapologetic about it. According to him, they \"have been trying to get the company who produces the coupons to take them off their website for three years now.\" Sounds a little sketchy to me. That in itself ruined my meal and had me feeling kind of embarrassed like I was in the wrong. Not a good way to treat a customer. I take customer service very seriously and since they didn't make a good impression, I won't go back.",

I love it all, there isn't one dish i don't like and i am sure you will agree. The food  however is a bit heavy and very filling, ordera few things to share.   Cachapa con queso or pabellon (corn pancake with cheese or pabellon style) Deliciously sweet and salty, moist and just made to order.  The empanadas are excellent too, deep fried and full of flavor. Get any of the meats with this.  The arepas are great too, our staple. The masa is thin and generously filled with the works. I like it with pabellon as well because that style has cheese, plantains, shredded beef and not too much of black beans cooked to a mush.   You can also get a side of fried plantains (sweet and browned). And the green sauces? put that $#!t on everything!  I had a passion fruit juice (parchita) which was just okay. You can't expect them to get the real fruit there, in the middle of the desert!I would go with a soda or malta. Or keep it light with some water, free.   Nothing in this place will let you down. This is Latino Food that not everybody gets to try but should.   Cheap, easy parking, fast service. A good break from the strip food.",

Parking was easy since they have a parking lot, even though it's on Las Vegas Blvd. It's a counter order establishment and the person who took our order was super nice and awesome. (If he had told me he owns that place, I wouldn't be surprised.) He greeted us when we walked in and after finding out it was our first time there, he made bunch of suggestions for us to try.  We got #1(wood fire steak), 7(chicken salad thing), 4(pork butt), 12(shredded beef, beans and plantain), and black bean & cheese empanada as he suggested. He did a great job on the suggestions because he made sure our food didn't have repeating ingredients. They were all great and tasty individually, but sadly, when we had all 4 in one setting, the chicken came in short on flavors. My favorite was the pork butt and slave girls' was shreed beef. Everything was well seasoned especially consumed with their house made spicy sauce.  They also serve entries other than arepas and based on the arepas we got, I can only imagine how amazing they will taste. Until next time, I will be drooling while dreaming.",

Everything on the menu is delicious, but you cannot go wrong with the #1 as a first timer. The arepas are little pockets of heaven filled with buttery melt in your mouth smoked meat. No sauce is needed, but the two bottles they set out on the tables nearly outshine the meat itself. The price for what you get is good; the serving is generous. One arepa will fill you up though you will be sad when the experience is over. The place is unassuming from the outside and cheery (and clean) on the inside. Service is friendly and laid back. If you haven't been yet, stop what you are doing and order an arepa immediately. It could save your life.",

It's in a sketchy area on Rainbow Blvd near a lot of wedding chapels, but when you get inside, everyone is really friendly and nice. It is not a sit down restaurant, you go up to the cash register and order (kind of like at a mall fast food joint) and they give you your food on a tray with a bottle of sauce. I ordered the reina pepiada arepa, which was a chicken arepa with cilantro and avocado... it was delicious! There are tvs to watch while eating your food and several tables to dine at. They make some really good arepas!",

Located on the corner of LV Blvd & Oakey, Viva Las Arepas is smack dab in the middle of what I'd consider a downtown hot spot, neighboring other local favorites - Vickie's (formerly Tiffany's) Diner, Art of Flavors, Dino's, Albo Pizza, Olympic Gardens, and that little shack that was once Goodwich.  They have a decent-sized menu with plenty of affordable combo options. I usually order the 3 chicken breasts + rice + beans for $6.99, along with a can of Coke for another $1.25, which is a pretty sweet deal to me since I'm always leaving with leftovers I can enjoy the next day. Their arepas are pretty tasty too, of course! And you can stuff 'em with whatever meats, cheeses, etc., you desire.  I especially love the layout of the restaurant. It's always very clean and cool indoors, and the patio area is great.",

Finally, it was Dad's day to pick where HE wanted to eat on Sunday. So off to Viva Las Arepa's we went  I chose a variety of Empanada's and Arepa's for every one to share. My family had never really experienced this type of food before but I was convinced this meal would satisfy there finicky eating habits.    I selected the Pork Butt Arepa's which had a smokey mesquite flavor and was slathered in a spicy sauce.  The flavors got even better when I drenched the corn cake sandwich in the house made cilantro sauce and the spicy verde hot sauce.  The sauces alone I could drink by the gallon.  The cilantro creamy sauce was so refreshing and had great flavor.  We also had a cheese Arepa and a black bean and cheese Arepa as well both were excellent.  The black beans were seasoned so perfectly and had just the right amount of salt to keep you savoring for more.      Next on the sampling list was the Empanada's we tried three types the black bean, the cheese and the Veg.  Once again we were not disappointed with the taste and quality of these items selected(at least the parents).  These cheese flavor had a yellow cheddar cheese which went perfectly with the fried corn turnover.    Overall this place is a must try in Vegas.  This restaurant takes great pride in their food quality and it shows.  They are a gluten free and Non-GMO restaurant which is a win, win for everyone.  Viva Las Arepa's even smokes all their meat in the back of the restaurant which gives the space a delicious smokey scent which makes you want to lick the walls it smells so good.  The staff have always been friendly here and are quick to greet you with a smile.  Another plus for me on this visit is that the chef noticed that my kids were out of french fries and gladly dropped a new batch to help keep my sanity on Father's Day.  Great Visit and we will be back very soon.",

Love the doughy flatbread the meat/shrimp/veggies comes in, it's crispy on the outside and soft and fluffy on the inside (yum!). My favorite filling is wood fired shredded chicken with avocado and garlic shrimp. Both are great. The also have a variety of other fillings and even a vegetarian version. You can add cheese, avocado, and now egg to any arepa.  The shredded chicken empanadas and guava and cheese pastelitos are great too. I tend to crave arepas and pastelitos now and then and always come here. I've never been disappointed.  The staff is very friendly and patient, even when I stare at the menu for 20 minutes thinking I'll order something new and still get what I was craving.",

But if this is the best of it, I probably won't want to order arepas again.   Service was great. You walk up to the counter to order, pay, get seated and someone will bring your food out. After you're done eating, clean up after yourself by throwing everything but the plastic baskets in the trashcan.   FRIED YUCCA ROOTS ($3)- interesting and fairly good. Tastes similar to potato fries except it's cut bigger and looks like sugar cane pieces.    REINA PEPIADA ($6) - chicken breast + avocado, mayo and cilantro arepa... filled me up but lacked the flavor and jazz I was looking for after reading reviews about it.   PORK BUTT w/ tomato slices ($5) - my bf said it tasted kind of like a sloppy joe haha. I suppose it's because of how the pork was shredded and the brown sauce it was drenched in.   We were given 3 bottles of sauces: cilantro and mayo sauce, green hot sauce, and ketchup. My bf liked the cilantro sauce  The passionfruit drink was good though.  It's located north of the strip with it's own parking lot. The restaurant itself is a hole-in-the-wall. I won't be coming back.",

    "text": "This popular downtown eats has been on my recent bookmarks to try. Arepas...a South American sandwich made of corn flatbread and various fillings. Located in the popular area of other Yelpdom heavy hitters like Art of Flavors and Goodwich, I figured Viva Las Arepas would be a no-brainer favorite. The restaurant inside is clean and warm, with more seating than parking available. If you haven't been, parking in the front is nearly non - existent. We ordered the Reina Pepiada, which is a featured review item and wood fired chicken arepas, plus an order of Yucca fries. In seeing the photos of the Reina Pepiada, I expected the sauce to be a light, creamy cilantro avocado type of dressing. What I actually experienced was very heavy and overly sauced chicken. With each bite, I kept thinking how the addition of a nice fresh slaw could cut some of that richness. The tortas were also heavy and chewy and again my expectations of a light, fluffy flatbread were dashed. I did like the peas, though. They provided additional sauces, which was unnecessary considering the meat was already drowning in it. The yucca fries were nothing special.  My daugter seemed to enjoy her wood fired chicken arepa. The Reina Pepiada didn't sit well with my wife as she was sick the rest of the night. Viva Las Arepas fell short of what I wanted to experience. I so wanted to love this place, but didn't. I will continue to search to hopefully find my ideal arepa.",

I was smelling smoke on my hands for the rest of the evening!  I also ordered the sweet corn arepas and it was also so tasty! Wonderful balance of sweet corn and mozzarella cheese.  I finished off the meal with a fried ravioli that had coconut in it.  Not too heavy or greasy.  This place is amazing and also cheap!  If you are staying on the strip just take the bus and it drops you off practically across the street.  Definitely worth the trip especially if you want cheap delicious food!!!",

We meandered down early in the morning (for vegas standards) so we decided to enjoy a little brunch. We had a couple of the arrepas and learned they are definitely too messy to share very well. But they are huge!! The fried plantains (not tostones) were ok, they needed a little more caramelizing for me!  All in all, i'm thinking i'm not really an arepas gal...  which is a bummer.

I had the Vegetarian Arepa and it was really good, fresh black beans, sliced avocado, tomatoes, and more. The sauce they provide you is also homemade.  The only reason for 4 stars, instead of 5 was the lack of a drink dispenser or I didn't see it. Either way it was incredible and I will surely be back to give them a hand full of money.",

    "text": "BAM! Been looking for an authentic Venezuelan place to get Arepas made as good as you can get in Caracas  AND THIS IS IT! What makes it so good? The Arepa is made with Pan which is a special starch to make the \"bread\" part of this sandwich. Next comes the fillings. Different combinations of flavors then what you'd expect to see here in the states. Ask the guys behind the counter for help if you get lost. The menu can overwhelm but it gives you an excuse to come back again and try them all! Each bite is loaded with spices! So good! Great for a quick bite, lunch, dinner or late night. Its on the corner in downtown Vegas which can be a bit dicey. I felt perfectly safe while there and we ate onsite. The inside reminds you of a fast food joint. Metal tables with short chairs. Red tile flooring. Small parking lot out front. I would definetly go back, take friends and tell everyone I know about this place. It is that good for what it is they do. AREPAS!",

Ever popular amongst locals and tourists alike with a menu focused on the Venezuelan flatbread sandwich alongside additional items both grilled and fried the time was just past two on my arrival to the deceptively large space and greeted by a short line with the dining room 2/3 full it would not be long before I found myself standing at the counter, a friendly middle-aged man expediting orders and assigning me number #36, my five boxed selections delivered to the table a mere fifteen minutes thereafter.   Clearly a restaurant vested in its core with a menu infrequent to change it was in a duo of 'sides' that my meal began and although bland plantains dripping with excess grease quickly proved inedible the unlikely star of the show would in fact be the wood-grilled pigskins, a crispy exterior overlying supple fat with intense brine offset by tender chunks of fried yucca.  Moving next to a pair of arepas it was with the wood grilled chicken that I started yet with flavors no better than the frozen stuff from Roots sold at Walmart I quickly moved to the pork-butt, the flavor almost indistinguishable from the bird as a trickle of oil ran down my hand into the napkin below.  At this point tossing what was left of each sandwich to instead sample the rinds and root with accompanying sauces it was finally with the $2 Pastelito that I finished and although tasty enough to stand on its own I couldn't help but think that for a buck per bite I'd have been better off staying next door with another scoop of gelato.",

I was even happier to discover this is the same establishment that was once a small stand outside the neighboring bar Dino's.   You've come a long way and do not disappoint. The arepas are delicious and filling! Good sauce too. The decor isn't anything amazing, but this isn't the kind of place where it really matters. The restaurant was packed with what I'm assuming was mostly a local crowd since its a little off the main strip.   All I can say is there is now a quick and easy place for me to grab a bite that will compete with my outstanding craving for Capriottis.   Good job guys! I can't wait to come back.",

I'm not sure what an Arepas was and how to pronounce it (nor do I even now!) but I can tell you it's wonderful!  The location is right across from another gem of mine, Luv It Frozen Custard on Oakey and LV Blvd.  Not sure how packed this place can get, but parking could become a problem.  I visited Saturday afternoon and didn't have too many issues.  So back to the food... I would describe an arepas as almost a Latin gyro sandwich.  Where you have a pita bread pocket stuffed with delicious meat.  You have several fillings to choose from, all of which are only $5!.  They also include a bottle of garlic sauce and hot sauce which helps add to the flavor of this pocket of tastiness.  All I know is I'm coming back here this weekend.  Just like how I refuse to have fast food that is not In N out, I most likely won't go back to Taco Bell in Vegas ever again!",

I love the #7 (Reina Pepiada), which combines avocado and cilantro, two of my favorite food ingredients.  The patty is always so soft and warm, the filling well-seasoned and plentiful.  My friend says the pork-butt is also delicious.    We usually get the food to go, but it looks like they are building an actual restaurant on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd and Wyoming or Oakley.  Otherwise, there's a table (or two) on the corner of Las Vegas Blvd, and a couple of stools at the counter.  It can feel a little random, but also provides a good forum for people watching.  (Like who is ordering food at the Chinese food/donut shop across the street?)  The arepas are cheap, and I only need to order one because they're big!  Also, if you have an order of $10 or less, there's a 0.50 cent charge to use a debit or credit card.",

    "text": "I have been reading about this place for quite some time. I've been wanting to drop by, but it's in a part of town I almost never find myself in. So last Thursday I got off work a little early and I asked the wife if she would like to try the place out.  Now let me preface what I am about to say by letting you know that I used to live in Venezuela, birth place of the wonderful arepa. I ate arepas every single day I lived there. Breakfast, lunch, dinner. Mid-afternoon snack. I've had them cooked on a griddle(traditional), deep-fried, and baked. And I loved them all. I cannot ever remember getting one I didn't like. My favorites order was \"Dos arepas de pollo y un pepsi (pronounced peksi down there)\" from La Areparia Diecinueve De Abril in Cumana. I'd stop there at least once a day.  That said, it was to my ginormous disappointment that last Thursday I had my first bad arepa.  Sorry folks, a  precooked arepa that's been sitting in a heating tray only to be tossed on the griddle at the last minute to be reheated is bad from the word go. Add to that mushy, bland pollo mechada(shredded chicken), and things don't get much better. The carne mechada (shredded beef) wasn't much better, or should I say not as bad. The jugo de parchita was watered down to the point of being almost indiscernible as passion fruit juice.  I promise, I really had high hopes for this place. Being the only Venezuelan restaurant in Las Vegas I was excited to try it. But as much as it pains me to say, Viva Las Arepas, I know arepas, and you are no arepa.",

They're all fantastic.  The arepas continue to be amazing as well.   You really can't go wrong.  My quibble with the food stand was underseasoning.  This no longer seems to be an issue.

Their authentic Venenzuelan food is well prepared and incredibly savory...and their salsas...OMG be sure to get the creamy green salsa, but I mix them both. I have turned on countless friends to this gem and all are grateful for the tip. I have been coming here for years, every time  I am in Vegas. I watched them start at a food cart, as we stumbled upon them on drunk night.lol. From then forward I am required to bring home at least 2 dozen empanadas for family to enjoy. Was overjoyed the day I came to Vegas and saw they finally had their own building and were thriving because WOW IS THEIR FOOD DELICIOUS! Their prices are reasonable and their staff is not just friendly and helpful but they will accommodate you beyond expectations.   Easy to access when traveling between the strip and Freemont St \"the old strip\" (its not far from Stratosphere). They have both indoor and outdoor seating available.  I recommend the beef empanadas, the chicken empanadas a close second, and the favorite Arepas are the carne asada and the roasted pork. Be careful though the aArepas are large, 1-2 per person is good.",

I had the shredded beef and my husband had the carne asada. When i say carne asada don't be fooled to think it's like Mexican style carne asada. This meat was smoked and it had a distinct mesquite taste! Both delicious just a different twist to this way of cooking the meat. We also had chicken empanadas. They chicken also had a the mesquite taste. The empanadas were not my favorite but not terrible either. They were just fried and airy. So when you bite into it there is a huge gap between the meat and the dough. I prefer Mexican style empanadas or Cuban style. These Venezuelans style were not my cup of tea. The tostones were really good! They were a perfect crisp and the perfect saltiness. The place is located in old Vegas. The neighborhood is sketchy but if you go in the day time it's ok. The inside is really clean and so are the restrooms which is always a plus for me.",

It is full of avocado, cilantro sauce and yummy chicken. I wish I had bought only this as the other arepas were lack luster.   The shredded beef one especially was dry and pretty chewy. Even after loading it up with the cilantro sauce, it was pretty blah. The chicken one was ok but the reina pepieda is the only one that warrants the 4 stars. Overall it's a pretty cheap and tasty alternative if you are looking for food in a hurry and if you order the right one.",

And to my surprise, that had a good kick to it. The other sauce was a mild cilantro/avocado-mayo sauce. Also very delicious but I preferred the heat. The Arepas was a good size because the meat in it was kinda heavy so, I'd just order one portion.

The flavors were bold and complex and I have a new favorite place. We also got the shredded beef empanadas, which were also very rich and satisfying. Way more filling than I thought they would be for the size.  I also got a side of plantains and they were yummy and carmalized from the cooking process. Everything I got tasted good in the sauces they gave me, even the plantains. God I want to take these sauces home!    The location is right next to art of flavors, which was our original destination.  However it wasn't open yet until 1, so when I realized one of my book marks was next door and smelled the amazingness that was coming from here, I had to try. I am so glad I did.  Just a heads up they have outside seating as well.",

For my money, the carne asada arepa, with egg and cheese added, is the money order. I also had their fried plantains for the first time, which were definitely interesting. I enjoyed them, but could see how they might not be everyone's cup of tea.   There was about a 10 minute wait, but I didn't mind it all that much. It meant that everything was cooked fresh.   The arepas look small but they are deceivingly filling. They cost between $5.50 and $7 each, which is pretty decent for what you get.   Overall, great little unique dining experience.",

    "text": "After 3 visits, this is my favorite restaurant in Las Vegas. It's not fancy, maybe it's not the place to celebrate a special occasion but the food is incredible. I visited last year as a non-meat eater and loved it. This trip, we are here for one night only and visited for both dinner and breakfast. There are no breakfast-y items on the menu...it's the same all day, but I knew I wouldn't be having it for a long time and doubled up.   I couldn't wait to visit as a carnivore. I asked the cashier what I might order and he gave me 2 amazing samples of beef. The wood fired beef is juicy and flavorful. We had it in an arepa and the flavors were muted. I'd suggest going for the plate of it where it can shine on its own.   Turns out my favorite 3 items are vegetarian. Surprise!  The corn and cheese arepa is a guilty please extraordinaire. It worked for dinner as well as breakfast and is equally fantastic alone or with a dab of the special mayo.   The fried plantains are sweet and mushy, cooked perfectly. The caramelization gives a nice bit of chew to offset the wonderful mushy texture. Mushy may be bad with most veggies, but in this case it's very appealing.   I don't remember the name of the cheesy bread stick that's off to the side of the menu. A little unassuming thing, it's like a doughnut with cheese and is 100 times better than my explanation.   For breakfast today we ordered the three items above and subbed in the chicken salad arepa for the beef. This was way too much food for the two of us for breakfast. My luck friend swears by it and my husband remembered loving it last year so I figured I needed to try it. Was it really good?  Indeed, it was. Just not AS good as my favorite 3 things. In all fairness, those would be pretty hard to beat.   Food is cooked to order and service has been good on every visit. There is plenty of seating and the restaurant has been very clean on each visit.   I love Viva las Arepas!!!",

They must be experienced, and the best place to experience it is at Viva Las Arepas.    Reina Pepiada- Chicken Breast mixed with Avocado, Mayo & Cilantro. Such a great flavor profile.  Pabellon- Beef, Black Beans, Plantains & Cheese. This is my second favorite, the beef is cooked perfectly. The beans and plantains compliment the beef and we all know cheese makes everything better  The empenadas are also delicious, try them all. They're like a dollar, stop being so cheap and try all of them. You're welcome.   IN CONCLUSION:  This is usually the first place I go when I land in Vegas. There is a reason they have 8 million 5 star reviews. IT IS AMAZING. Stop reading this and book your ticket or get in you car and drive to vegas and feast at Viva Las Arepas!",

    "text": "As I was passing through Vegas, I needed something quick but also something different. I found this place on Yelp and it looked intriguing. Came here on a Sunday around 5 and it wasn't crowded. I decided to order an arepa with carne asada, tomatoes and lettuce (#1) and one with the shredded chicken and avocado (#7). I was not disappointed at all by my choices. The wood fire beef was cooked well and the meat was very flavorful. The chicken was also flavorful, moist, and creamy inside. I really liked that it was like a torta but the \"bun\" was made of corn. I was scared that buying only 2 of them wasn't going to be enough, but it fills you up fast. We also shared the chicharron with yucca fries and the fried plantains. The chicharron was fried well and fresh while the plantains were sweet but not overly oily. According to Yelp, everyone really likes the sauces here. They give you 2 bottles, one which is a creamy spicy sauce while the other one is a verde green sauce. The creamy sauce was great with all of them while the verde salsa was fairly typical of most Latino restaurants. Overall I thought the food was super good here. I would definitely come back here in a heart beat when going through Vegas. The only reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because of the prices. I thought $5-$7 was a tad steep for what you're actually getting. Don't get me wrong, it was really good, but to get pretty full, you'll probably end up spending $10-$12, which isn't bad at all, just not as cheap as I thought it would be.",

We never eat on the strip when in Vegas because it's overpriced and generally not very good. This place made it to the top of our search because of it's high ratings, and this time, Yelp did not let us down.   Arepas, for those that don't know, are maize (corn) dough stuffed with meat or other fillings and toppings. It's a Latin spin on a pita-like sandwich. Although I have nothing to compare this to, I was very impressed. The bread was hot and fluffy and sweet - everything you love about corn-based bread. We got the Wood Fire Beef and Reina Pepiada (a chicken salad with avocado, mayo, and cilantro). I liked that we got one with hot filling and one with cold filling. We also ordered fries, which were just standard frozen fries, but they were piping hot and crispy, so they were perfect.   Prices were reasonable, and the service was friendly. Will definitely stop by again the next time we're in town.",

There is something wonderful about arepas after a couple of beers...in fact in those moments Viva Las Arepas might garner 5 stars from me!  Most of the items here are good...such as the empanadas, meat w/ 2 sides, etc.  Still, like the name says, I come here for arepas.  The arepas are not just good for Vegas arepas, they are downright good arepas period.  I still miss their old stand there was something beautiful about getting divey at Dino's, grabbing an aprepa, and then finishing things off at Luv-It custard.  And while you can still walk all three of those, the ambiance has certainly changed still Viva Las Arepas opened and actual restaurant.  The interior of the space is now somewhere between a Roberto's and a Baja Fresh...there is plenty of seating, but it's not a place I want to hang out at.  Get a couple of arepas, or better yet share several items with a friend or two...the prices are nice here, so order a little more!",

    "text": "Hubby and I stopped by one lazy Sunday night, our last night in town.  We were both still full from a late lunch so we ended up only ordering 1 arepas, the flame grilled beef, and a cachapas.    We took it back to our hotel room and chowed down.  The cachapas definitely would have been a lot better hot.  But then again...it was only a 10 minute drive back to our hotel - how quickly should I have to eat this thing to capitalize on maximum deliciousness?  I love how corn-y it tasted but with the hardened cheese in between, it became somewhat less palatable.  Also, it's sweet so prepare your mouth for that taste profile.  Hubby ordered the flame grilled beef arepa.  On first bite, I wasn't convinced it was better than our usual spot out here.  But when he gave up on it, I took the 1/3 he had left and nibbled.  I have to say the sauces and veggies inside were surprisingly good.  The arepas are definitely a good size and one will probably fill you up pretty well.  I'm glad we got to try it, at least.  The guy who took our order was very nice and gave us the delicious sauces which tasted better with the arepa than the cachapa.",

    "text": "At the moment I'm going to rate 3-STARS only because not only is this my first visit to VIVA LAS AREPAS but my first AREPA.  \"Don't judge me, I'm a AREPA VIRGIN\"  Before the upgraded location I would pass the stand at least 4x's a week.  But it never called out to me: \"c'mon dee, you know you want to try one, just one.  pull the car over dee, you won't be disappointed\" Needless to say that conversation never happened.  So the other day I was watching Triple D and Guy Fieri was at a restaurant named VALENCIA LUNCHERIA and the chef made REINA PEPIADA.  I can't lie, it looked so delicious my mouth to started to water (stop laughing).  So I told myself that I will make a trip to VIVA LAS AREPAS.  I'm not quite sure about this, but I think they've been here in Las Vegas for at least 5yrs.  It's VEGAS, longevity does not come easy in this town.  OK, so enough of the introduction to this review, let's get to the REAL:  I order the REINA PEPIADA w/ a side order of handcut shortstrings.  I promise no disrespect to the Venezuelan culture, this reminds me of a TORTA. I didn't say it taste like a torta, its just reminiscent of a torta (its the san diegan in me)  FOOD:  AREPA shredded chicken breast w/ avocado and cilantro, accompanied w/ a creamy cilantro dressing and salsa.  the AREPA itself is grilled to a light brown, giving a nice crust w/ crunch.  the chicken breast is mixed together w/ the avocado and cilantro. (creamy chicken salad style)  super light and dense, nice crunch when you bite into it.  the chicken is not under/over cooked nor seasoned.  perfect amount of spice, topping the AREPA w/ the salsa is the KICKER.  OMG, the salsa by itself delicious, it has the kind of heat that does not hit you right away, the heat kicks in at the back of the throat.  Mmm, Mmm, Mmm that shizzy is FIRE!  the creamy cilantro dressing I did not dress my AREPA w/ it for the avocado covered that for me.  FRENCH FRIES i will pass on these, maybe because I got it to go my fries were soggy.....ok, no that's not going to work for me.  I'M JUST SAYING there is another well known establishment that offers handcut fries and they always make it to the house w/ crisp.   Arepas are reasonably priced, the most \"expensive\" arepa on the menu is $6.00 (Shrimp and Garlic arepa).  The fries are nothing fantastic, there are alternatives to the fries: fried plantains of fried yucca root.  There are other things that I would like to try on this menu, so I will be making a couple of more visit to experience the other Venezuelan delights on this menu.   SUN -THU: open til 10pm FRI-SAT: open til MIDNIGHT  TRY THEM OUT, I'M GOING BACK ;-)",

Under $50. We needed half of this food, it was delicious but so filling for 5 of us.  Our favorite was the wood fired beef and the pork.  Next favorite was the black bean.    We didn't care for the shrimp.  It was good quality shrimp, but the combination just didn't work for us.  I think we were just used to having beef, pork or beans in this type of food.    Heavy, filling food.  If you have never tried Venezuelan food, this would be a great place to start!",

    "text": "Came to this little gem on a late Saturday morning and I've been wanting to come back ever since! This is Venezuelan food done right, as you can taste the wood fire smoke and freshness in each pastry. This shop is located just a stone's throw away from The Stratosphere Hotel and definitely worth the drive from the strip. Parking lot in front and on the side of the building was easy enough. For 5 food items off the menu for 2 people (look below), our total came to about $24. -cup of black coffee (wasn't the best, wasn't absolutely horrible) -shredded chicken arepa (this was hands down THE BEST item, IMO on the menu) -beef arepa (the little beef chunks in this was pretty good, but the shredded chicken had much more flavor and punch) -beef and rice pastelito (this was also AMAZING and just perfection! ) -chicken empanada (I'm not sure how they get their pastry dough so perfect, but I want 10 more of these) -guava and cheese pastelito (Wasn't a huge fan of this one, probably won't order it again next time).   This place has something to please any one. They even  have gluten-sensitive items if you're into that stuff. Check it out if you're somewhere nearby, you won't regret it! I can't wait to come back to this delightful gem.",

    "text": "Do NOT miss this chance to get Arepas, if you are visiting Las Vegas. Do not fail to support a local business, if you are a resident! On our first visit, I had the reina pepiada (chicken/avocado) arepa and my husband had the pabellon (shredded beef) arepa. Both were so delicious!! The masa wrap was crisp but tender, and the fillings very flavorful. We've since tried most of the fillings, and every arepa has been fresh and tasty. This is a far distance from Mexican food; but f you like a little heat, there are Venezuelan hot sauces on the tables.  We've also had the pastelitos, and while we didn't think they quite as good as the arepas, the fillings were very flavorful. The Venezuelan sodas are exotic enough to be worth a try too; but my personal favorite drink is the \"Agua Panela\", sugar cane with lime. I love any drink that involves raw sugar cane, and in this one the lime cuts the sweetness just right but not so much that it tastes like limeade. I have two standout memories from my first visit. First, I wanted to try the yuca fries, but my husband was being a little conservative about them. So we didn't order...but the owner brought over an order for us to try anyway, on the house! They were so good and crispy, and I've ordered them ever since. My second memory is of the wood stacked in full view of the dining area, so you know they are always smoking that meat right in-house.  I also have to complement the owners on a bright, folksy, and clean atmosphere. It was a pleasure to sit there...reminded me a lot of small cafes we encountered in our trips to central America...but with air-conditioning, LOL! Very affordable eating for \"The Strip\"...please get out of those casinos and try this and other local businesses in our fabulous city. By the way, the very best gelato place in town, \"Art of Flavors\" is right next door (that's not just my opinion, but I totally concur); so save some room for dessert.",

    "text": "I am in love with this place! I have eaten lunch here 3 times in the past two weeks... Trying something new everytime! I have seen several great reviews on this place, so I had to stop and check it out. A little stand in Dino's parking lot that cranks out food with lots of flavor.   The first visit I tried the most popular item - Shredded Beef Arepa! 2 cornmeal cakes stuffed with shredded beef in the middle that was seasoned perfectly. They then give you a creamy cilantro sauce or hot sauce to put on...  The creamy cilantro is the best! The sandwich appears small, but don't let it fool you.. It is filling... Thinking it was small, I also tried the chicken empanada! Yum.. It was so good, I kept eating it, although I was full.   2nd visit, I called ahead of time to have the Hallaca  which is a mixture of beef, pork, chicken, rasins, vegetables, olives, and capers wrapped in cornmeal dough, and finally, wrapped in plantain leaves, tied with string, and boiled after. Top it off with the creamy cilantro.. YUM! Another great combination of flavors you won't experience anywhere else. I also tried a pastelito, the ground beef and rice.. another great choice.   3rd visit, I went with a cold arepa, the vegetarian.. Lots of great taste, but very hard to eat. It kept sliding so I couldn't take a bite of all the flavors at one time. But the individual flavors did not disappoint. Again, very filling, so don't let the size fool you.   All 3 visits the food tasted great, fresh and the service from Felix is fantastic.  I plan to be a regular here.. It's that good!",

    "text": "For arepas (corn flour sandwiches), Viva Las Arepas is definitely one of the best places in town. I came here the third day it was open, when it was still called I Love Arepas and when signage wasn't as visible and impressive. I met Felix, the owner. He really prides himself on his recipe for his corn masa bread. He has the bread ready and preps everyday. He has trays of the bread and when you order, he heats up the bread for you right in front of you for you to see. What you might not know is that his back is aching just so you can see what he is doing because he set the grill up lower, so whenever he cooks, he really has to bend over and strain his neck for you to see how he's cooking everything in the trailer.  The trailer is where all the business and eating is done. His storage is right next to Dino's Neighborhood Bar. If you ever ask him, he might show you. His storage is filled with Corn Flour. His arepas are Venezuelan. Arepas are also really popular in Colombia. Anyway, he uses the freshest ingredients. His aguas (juices) are from concentrate and blended with filtered water. He has guanabana (soursop), guayaba (guava), parchita (passion fruit) and mango (mango, lol).   My favorite sandwich is the  Reina Pepiada: Fresh chicken with avocado cream sauce, great textures and came out piping hot, so it was really delicious.   I have tried many of the other sandwiches. They're all really delicious. The empanadas are filled with fresh meats. Their dessert, quesillo, was really delicious. Even though Felix doesn't like it being compared with a cheese flan, I felt that would be how I would describe quesillo to anyone.   This might look like a fast food joint to you, but he really takes the time to care about and cook his food. He enjoys telling people about the process of making his food. I enjoy listening to chefs talk about how they make their food.    I had a great experience all five times that I went to this place. I think that everybody in town should try to hit up this spot at least once. It's really a gem.",
