    "text": "I'm not sure if it was me expecting too much because all my other mastro's experiences in california were Uh-Ma-Zing, but this experience at Mastro's in Las Vegas was very much so a disappointment.  I'm with Brad T, only 3 stars.... =(  1.  Kunomoto oysters were ordered off menu and pretty fresh and tasty, but I've had better. 2.  By the time we finished our oysters, which was only a few minutes because we eat fast, we started our COLD crab cakes.  I don't know about other people's experiences, but we've always had our crab cakes kind of toasty.  Though it was crab-a-licious, I was put off by the temperature. 3.  Our 22 oz bone-in ribeye was cooked rare plus and it was delicious!  The extra sear with clarified butter is fantastic.  However, I was not pleased with the amount of connective tissue in my half of the steak.  I felt like I was prepping my own meal by having to cut through all that chewy stuff! 4.  Here's the moment of utmost disappointment.  I was thinking about my fluffy, warm and tasty butter cake all night long, and it was a butter cake fail.  It was not warm and fluffy as I remember.  It was actually almost grainy and almost cold on the outside, save the inside was warm but almost soggy.  The wonderful airy whipped cream was actually heavy and too sweet.  Conclusion:  For being open for 6 months, should I expect it to be where its other Mastro counterparts are in amazing-ness, or should I expect it to be working out its kinks and be amazing 6 more months down the line?  Regardless of kinks or not, I'm a sad puppy because other than the yummy steak mixed with connective tissue bits, everything else was just average compared to my other Mastro's experiences.  Mastro's did not rise to the occasion to it's reputation.  Will I go back?  For the love of butter cake, I will after more time has passed for this particular establishment.  [side note: If you do try this particular Mastro's, do asked to be sit in the nice atrium with the mollusk looking wooden structure and not right outside of it.  I think you will get better service.  It seems as if the table we were sitting at is a \"blind spot\".  The servers liked to walk over an peer over the railing next to you and chat about the stores and patrons below as if you weren't there.]",

She talked to us like friend not some table she was waiting on. She was very knowledgable and playful. Just a complete delight. The food is a little pricy but for the amount of food,great service and beautiful atmosphere you get it was worth it. I'm obsessed with the cran gnocchi !

When I first arrived, I was greeted by the front, she showed me to my table.  while walking towards our table, i was greeted again by another waitress passing by us.  when i arrived at the table, the front service didn't even bother to pull the chair for me.  The restaurant had unique architecture design. I looked around our table and noticed there were a lot of ... gold diggers in the restaurant. Lol table next to me were party of two females, they were trying to hit on \"johnny depp\" look a like singer/musican at the restaurant.  I ordered bone-in ribeye, sweet potato fries, and calamari for appetite. Few minutes later, our waiter brought 4 different types of cold bread. Petzel, fried, chatula, and other bread I can't remember. I wished the bread was warm it would have been better.  Finally after waiting 10 minutes, our calamari came out.. damn it was salty.. I couldn't finish the calamari, it tasted straight out of ocean.. my steak came out sizzling on hot plate and sweet potato fries were in big basket enough to feed party of 4.  First bite of fries were... f&ck its salty..  now on to the steak... omg the chef has lost his tongue... its also super salty...  and outside was a little overcooked, it had the crispy burned taste.  well ..that's end of my story.. the food was soo salty, I gave up trying to finish $100 meal.. chef probably thought that i was exposed to japanese nuclear radiation and i needed extra iodine in my thyroid. the waiter couldn't keep up refilling my water.. i ended up drinking total of 4 cups of water. my worst preminium steak house experience.",

We started off with the seared Ahi Tuna, which was super fresh and delicious, followed by a great caesar salad. For the main course I had a fantastic filet cooked to perfection. But the best was the sides. Our table shared the Gorgonzola mac & cheese, sweet potato fries, and sauteed broccoli. They were all fantastic, but the mac & cheese was TO DIE FOR.  Shauna said the warm butter cake was not to be missed and she wasn't kidding. I'm surprised my arteries survived that cake after everything we'd already eaten, but it was worth risking it. :)",

The oysters were alright but didn't really impress me either . I had the bone-in filet mignon which was absolutely heavenly !! It was so yummy and literally melted in my mouth !! Their filet mignon is perfect ... the best I ever had !! The cream of corn made the perfect side . It was very delicious . They also carry white muscat wine which was good . It came out to be about $100 per person with the muscat wine including tip but it was totally worth it . I will definitely be back here again the next time I am in Vegas !",

I would like to say the Seafood Tower was incredible, although I would prefer the food on there chilled and not frozen, that was not so great. Steak was epic which boosted the rating to 3 stars. Overall, not where I would go again while in Vegas, I will leave Mastros for those who do it best in California.",

I had the Swordfish blackened, my wife had a fresh seasonal filet of Wild Caught Salmon seasoned with their special house blend.  Both were outstanding and some of the largest fish filets we have ever seen, but yet still cooked and seasoned to perfection.  Also had amazing sides of asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  Service was great and I would recommend that anyone should try it at least once.  Prices are high, but side dishes are served family style, so at least you will get full unlike some of those trendy-trash places that give you a fish nugget with a red sauce on it and call it gourmet.  Go there and eat fish.",

    "text": "A couple of weeks ago I went to dinner by myelf at Mastro's Ocean Club, the wooden donut shaped eatery located in the middle of the new Crystal's shopping mall at City Center.   It was tempting to fill up on the bread basket filled with pretzel and rye bread sticks, Parmesan crackers, and teardrop sourdough boules, but I restrained myself and saved room for a half order of the Spicy Mambo Salad ($7.99) and the Sauteed Shrimp appetizer ($18.95). Everything at Mastro's is fairly expensive, so these dishes were a great way to test their quality without spending a ton. The Spicy Mambo Salad was essentially a Caesar salad with horseradish in the dressing, and being a huge fan of horseradish, I very much enjoyed it. I always ask for light dressing (or dressing on the side) in less expensive restaurants because more expensive restaurants generally know how to dress a salad properly, and Mastro's was no exception. If anything, the salad bordered on verge of being under-dressed, so if you are a fan of heavy salad dressing, I would ask for extra. The sauteed shrimp were nothing less than wonderful, and hit the spot for my seafood craving. The huge shrimp were cooked just right and served over a broth that tasted like a lobster bisque reduction rich with butter. The cheesy garlic bread croutons absorbed this liquid on one end, but remained crunchy at the other, providing some textural contrast. It was fun to dip all the different kinds of bread from the basket in the sauce as well to see how they each paired differently. Overall it was a really successful dish, and because the shrimp were so plump and the sauce so rich, it was certainly enough for my entree. One item that I might have tried as a side had I been with someone, however, was the lobster mashed potatoes - they looked fantastic. I wasn't too disheartened by not getting them, as I still had a terrific meal that was plenty filling.  I wanted to order their signature butter cake dessert, but because it was $14 and I was full by that point, I decided to pass. I'm sure it's enough for two to three people so maybe next time I go and I'm not by myself I'll splurge and get it.",

I hoped if eating at a table vs private room it would be better. Wrong!  Save your money and eat elsewhere... Preferably not in City Center though as all of those restaurants seem to be overrated.",

Just like the one in Beverly Hills, this place had outstanding service! Honestly, it has better service than the one in Beverly Hills. Our server, Tanya, was amazing. She kinda resembles Chelsea Lately but way prettier.. anyways she was very accommodating even though she was busy with other tables. I was impressed by her. Since it was my birthday, we got a complimentary dessert of my choice and I chose the warm butter cake. It is so delicious. We got escargot for an appetizer following our main course which was a rack of lamb with a side of creamed spinach along with a sushi tower which consisted of hamachi sashimi and clear lobster roll. Every single thing we ordered was simply delightful and at times, I wish I can go to Vegas just to eat at this specific location of Mastro's. Because it's Vegas, it is a little more crowded but the ambiance still reflects an elegant and classy environment. Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club for making my birthday memorable :)",

Unless you are obsessed with broccoli I suggest spending your $10 and a different side.    Looking at other reviews it looks like I should have ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and warm butter cake  instead of the shrimp and broccoli.  Also while this is clearly a classy place, its also an open view restaurant where you are exposed to people walking by in the surrounding mall and there is not much space between you and other diners.  This gives off a somewhat casual flair to this place for guests expecting a more intimate and special occasion.",

The warm spinach salad was drenched in sauce and the ahi tuna tostada appetizer didn't taste very fresh.  The entrees do not come with anything else...no side pasta, potatoes, or salad.  So, if you order a bland grilled dried swordfish, that's it, that is all you get for $40 on a large plate.  Presentation in the food was not there for a so-called high-end restaurant.  The blackened scallop was so salty that it was difficult to eat it.  We celebrated our birthdays there and got a very dried complimentary chocolate cake.  We did order their signature butter cake also, and that was decent.  But, for $16, we have definitely tasted much better for less.  Overall, the ambience is nice.  Service was nothing to rave about, and food was very average.  Cost didn't match the overall underwhelmed experience.  If you are willing to spend, go somewhere else.",

I don't normally eat seafood but when I was here I had tried the crab legs and they were super tender and buttery and succulent. They serve these huge crab legs that are already split and cracked so you don't have to spend an hour trying to suck a little piece of meat out of the shell.   My steak was ridiculously good, medium-well filet mignon, I don't even have words to explain it because I start to stttttuudder, it was that good. The Gorgonzola mac and cheese was excellent, I wish we would have taken our left over mac but we were in Vegas and we weren't going back to our hotel room right after dinner.  The mushrooms were soooo good, nice meaty mushrooms, I believe they were shittake shrooms.  Bread basket was awesome, all kinds of different breads to snack on.

    "text": "I've had a number of people recommend Mastro's in cities across the country, it wasn't until recently I realized there was a location right here at home. Oddly enough I was familiar with the space, but never put two and two together. It's the bird's nest, the unmistakable structure in the Crystals.  We were started with a huge bread basket. All of which was fresh and delicious. I also had the Strawberry Mule ($15), which was a refreshing twist on the moscow mule.  If I'm being honest, it was the Dungeness Crab Cocktail ($28) that swayed me to try Mastro's. It's my favorite crab and this was scrumptious. All the flavor, but without the fuss. It is served over dry ice so the presentation is rather striking.  With \"Ocean Room\" in the name I had to try the fish. I was tempted by the halibut on special, but I chose the Chilean Seabass ($49). It was a huge filet, that was moist and flaky. Surprisingly, their turf seems to be just as good as their surf, the husband had the Rack of Lamb ($49) and it was fantastic. I really like that the preparation is simple, just properly seasoned to allow the flavor of the meat to shine. We went for decadence when selecting our sides. I had to try the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($33) and the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese ($14) piqued his interest. Both were rich, creamy and gooey. The crab in the gnocchi was too delicate for this dish it was overpowered by the creamy sauce and the bold truffle flavor. Both were mighty tasty, however.  We ate until we could eat no more, and there was a bunch leftover. Rarely do we have leftovers to box up, but it seemed like we hadn't even touched our sides. The portions are quite large and will satisfy the heartiest of appetites. We were much too full to attempt dessert. Their famous butter cake will have to wait. Service was attentive; overall, a really great experience. It's nice to have another option for seafood in the desert.",

I read great reviews of Mastro's, and a couple bad ones, but we forged ahead as it was one of the top 3 in LV.  The food was presented extremely well, had outstanding flavor, and nothing seemed to have been prepared in advance.  Our server, Trista, made a 4.5 meal into a 5 star evening. The lobster bisque is a must have, if only to share, but don't miss it.  Sea scallops and Brussels sprouts were done perfectly. But the big surprise, although I had no room left (I did push through the pain) was the dessert. A butter cake with ice cream and fresh whipped cream on the side. Get the butter cake to share at the end.  Seemed odd to go to an upscale shopping mall for dinner, but the suspended atmosphere at Mastro's gave our evening a very fun feel. We will be back, but still probably won't order a steak.",

Its located on the second floor overlooking the shopping area. Don't let the location fool you this place is absolutely on the money. The food was absolutely delicious. The service was absolutely amazing. Our waitress was one of the best I've had in a while.The customer base is upscale which is what I expected based on the price. I took my wife here for her birthday so it had to be great. We had Belvedere Martini's, Oysters, Chilean Sea bass, and one of the best deserts I've ever had. They had blue cheese stuffed olives for our martini's which is a sign of a True upscale restaurant. We had such a good time we walked back to our hotel suite. Great food, Great service, comfortable atmosphere. I'm not picky I just know what good is.  Flash.......",

    "text": "Well, I did a poor job of keeping up with the reviews to become Elite but hey Yelp gave it to me anyways since Im so hilarious. So, I'm back!  Mastros is one of the few steakhouse chains that I would say can compete with the best steakhouses around. Ive been to a few in California and all are great. The one in Vegas keeps the tradition alive and well. Crystals is a swanky shopping area in the Strip so this is definitely a place you'd expect to drop some serious coin. And this is Vegas so if you aren't planning on it then you can leave.  Chopped Salad- well it was salady. Standard dish and easy to split.  Bone in Filet 12 oz- Probably the best filet I've had in Vegas. Cooked perfect medium rare.  Lobster Mash- obvi delicious but probably an unnecessary 30 dollar side.  Roasted Brussel sprouts- Idk how they cooked these but they were the best brussel sprouts Ive had period. Even my father who hates them couldn't deny that they were great.  Warm Butter Cake- Ah yes the buttery goodness. One of my favorite desserts whenever it's on a menu no matter the restaurant. Mastro's does it right.  The reason Mastro's is legit is that it keeps the traditional steakhouse vibe of olden times and perfects it. None of menu items are crazy out there or artistic concoctions like at GR Steak but the quality of the food is not debatable. There is no chain steakhouse as good as Mastro's let me tell you.",

We set up dinner reservations for 6:30 prior to a 9:45 flight that would get us the hell out of Vegas; while it wasn't the best idea in terms of timing, we were just super eager to eat at Mastro's and couldn't cram it in earlier in the trip.  We were seated in the middle of the big floating wooden structure, which was excellent for the view and being in the middle of all the hustle and bustle of the restaurant (something I really like). Our waiter was excellent; he made us feel at ease and happily answered all our questions about ordering.  The first order of business? A nice bottle of wine. Fortunately, they had several wines in the $60 range that I like and pair nicely with both fish and meat (keeping our options open :-) ). We chose the 2009 Grgich Hills Merlot, and sat around merrily sipping until our starters came.  The Seared Albacore with Truffle (see the picture) was really damn good. I could have eaten two plates of that and been happy. The Tuna Tartare was good, but not amazing. Yep, I've dinged it for \"not being amazing\". We went in all different directions for main course: one bone-in steak, one cooked fish dish, one sashimi tuna dish. All were excellent. The sides were excellent. Everything was excellent. See a pattern?  Somewhere in the middle of the main course we ran out of wine and unconsciously ordered another! Why not go out with a bang.  The hour was winding down, our stomachs at near capacity, and fears of the implications of missing our flight creeping in, yet we got dessert. The Warm Butter cake. Dude. Best part of the meal. Might have been the best part of the weekend. Don't go without it.  Thanks Mastro's for an awesome dinner. I'll be back next time I'm in Vegas.",

No Vegas trip is complete without a nice dinner, and we couldn't have picked a better spot for what we were looking for that night: delicious food and wine in a classy, yet relaxed atmosphere.   Located within the Crystals shopping complex, you don't get amazing views of Strip, but the environment still exudes class and modern decor.  We had the works.  A bottle of Pinot shared among the three of us while we nibbled on the best damn bread assortment I've seen.  Two salads: Caesar and a Wedge, standard fare and did not disappoint.  And then....drumroll....the entrees!  Juicy, thick bone-in ribeyes for my two burly man-pals, who both only ate about half before conceding to the dish's fate as leftovers.  And for myself: perfectly seasoned, perfectly cooked, jumbo sea scallops sauteed in a rich butter sauce and served with a few Parmesan-crusted crostinis.  Crisp golden brown on the surface while tender and delicate within, the plate came with about 6 jumbo scallops, but try as I might, I couldn't finish the dish for lack of stomach space!  Wonderful side pairings of garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms to share.  Absolutely no room for dessert.  It was a fantastic meal.",

After booking a reservation here on OpenTable, I arrived on the date of my reservation to be UNgreeted (I'm using it, English fanatics!) by the *two* associates in the front.  Both were busy with other, more important things I suppose.  But then, finally, attention was given.  They couldn't locate my reservation, and then finally found it to let me know it was the next night, not the night I arrived.  I was noticeably upset, as I had even received an email from OpenTable to confirm my reservation.  (I guess it was an OpenTable error somehow though... and have since had other OT issues).  Fortunately, they were accommodating in squeezing me and my boyfriend in on a busy Friday night. We got a great spot even - but then I suppose not many seats at this small restaurant wouldn't have a nice \"view\".   You're in a bird cage overlooking all of the shoppers!  Throughout the entire meal, attention was not lacking.  You're pretty much pampered here, and every.single.associate is ON IT.    Are you about to take a picture of your group? Not without assistance from a waiter.    Had more than a few sips of water?  It'll be refilled practically instantaneously.  So, the service once seated was impeccable.   Drinks - very reasonable for vegas, and they do it right. No dilution here.  Food:  Complimentary Bread:  Well, I had already known just how good their pretzel bread was from former visits in the O.C., and while the Las Vegas pretzel bread was slightly harder, it was still delicious.  Mushrooms:  Infused with something magical.  Seriously, savored every single bite of these. Hands down, the greatest mushrooms that have ever met my taste buds.  Mac & Cheese:  Ridiculously cheesy.  Cheese with pasta, with more cheese, with a blanket of cheese melted on top of it.  And surprisingly good as a left over too.    Steak:  Filet Mignon.... no sauce needed, no seasoning needed.  The cut of meat was flawless and perfectly tender.    Dessert:  I did say I was saving the best for last, and this was it.  Butter cake, all the way. Moist cake accompanied with vanilla ice cream... sounds traditional but they've got a recipe that will leave every bite ending with Oohs and Aaahs.  The house-made whipped cream came in a massive pile, and then some.",

Service wise: condescending and the dude was barely looking at me directly when I was the one addressing him.  I was def chop liver for the evening.  Until I whipped out the camera and then the plastic.  LAME.    Food: Check the photos.   -The Spicy Caesar looked like a free side of salad from IHOP.  'Cept it was over $10.  WTF?!?! -Crabcakes were mushy.  Gotta have the crusty texture.  They were huge.   -Filet had no crust and again was mushy.  Color was off too, pink on the OUTSIDE.   -Berry bowl was MASSIVE.  Presentation sloppy just like the rest of the meal.  Great bottle prices for Pinot Noirs.  Oh the manager called me personally to thank me for my patronage the day after.  YAY.  I really don't get how this chain survives and where all the hype stems from.  I know many other restos my $250 could have been spent better.  OpenTable Bonus Point table currently.  Hooray for 1,000 pts!!!",

    "text": "*** Word of warning: this steakhouse is located inside a mall and you will most likely have a view of a high-end store while you eat. ***   Typically, I'm a huge fan of Mastro's and every time we are celebrating a special occasion, we will pay a visit to Mastro's. Unfortunately I was a little disappointed in the Vegas location.   I will start with the pros. The food was sublime. It was exactly the quality of food Mastro's provides at their locations in Phoenix. I started with the Ocean Club Salad which came with fresh shrimp with blue cheese dressing, avocado and tomatoes. The salad was refreshing and delicious and filled me up! However, I wasn't done just yet. Following the salad, I ordered the crab cake and shared the lobster mac and cheese with my husband. The crab cake was made of fresh crab and was more crab than filling which was perfect. The Lobster Mac and Cheese is always a must and you can't visit Mastro's without ordering it! I also stole a bite of my husband's filet which was cooked to perfection. Yes, I did roll out of the restaurant but rolled out fat and happy from the amazing food! They cook everything to perfection and it's always a gluttonous good time.   So why the three stars? Sadly, that goes to ambiance and service. The restaurant in located inside a mall. Granted, it's a very high-end mall but it's still a mall just the same. That wouldn't make a huge difference except that the restaurant has an open floor plan with an open balcony which means you are looking out into the mall while you eat. It's very light and bright and just doesn't provide for a very romantic experience. They do have a tree-like structure that you can eat in which hides the mall a little bit, but it's hard to forget that you're in a mall during your meal. Considering that it's Vegas and there are so many venues with wonderful ambiance, I would choose another restaurant next time.   The customer service was also a bit disappointing. I felt like we were always trying to get our server's attention. He wasn't very attentive to us and anytime we wanted to order another drink or food, we had to hunt him down. We were going to order dessert but it took him so long to check on us that by the time he came to our table, we were just ready to go at that point. I would have liked it if the server was a bit more attentive so that we didn't have to track him down the whole meal.   While the food was amazing, the ambiance and service left something to be desired and since Vegas has so many restaurants to choose from, we will choose a different restaurant during our next visit to the Strip.",

    "text": "In short, our meal was absolutely phenomenal-- perhaps one of the best we've ever had in Vegas. With every element of the meal nearly flawless, I could not keep marveling over each little detail of our experience. Yelp here has Mastro's at a 4.5+ average on 250+ reviews..this is no fluke!  We came here for my mom's birthday dinner and my expectations were MORE than exceeded.  We were promptly seated for our 9:30 reservation within the \"Tree House,\" as the hostess called it; it had a very loft feel to it yet was very quaint had a warm, welcoming atmosphere. I'll definitely ask to be sat in this area again.  As we passed by the bar area, we were greeted by spectacular live music, consisting of a woman singing accompanied by a fantastic piano player (who also added in some vocals). Big plus for this.  After immediately seating us, the hostess hurried to bring us black napkins to avoid the lint of white napkins attaching itself to our dark clothing. We didn't even ask. Nice touch.   Rob, our waiter, and the rest of the waitstaff that took care of our table were nothing but spectacular. I was a bit worried at first as my water glass remained empty for a good 15 minutes, but this was the sole flaw of the entire evening (and a minor one at that). Rob was extremely congenial, professional, yet very personable and extremely accommodating of our wishes.   We like to split things a lot when we go out to dinner so that we get our own little smorgasbord of items to try...and a smorgasbord we got! Not only this, but the chefs made sure to split nearly everything that came to the table (even the bone-in steak we ordered!) Now, where do I even begin...  --Vanilla Battered Shrimp: Caution: Oxymoron... MASSIVE shrimp. The biggest shrimp I've seen in recent memory. The batter wasn't really too vanilla-tasting in my opinion, but this was a delicious starter regardless. Three to an order!   --Burrata & Heirloom Tomato Salad: Mmm, burrata cheese is one of my favorites! Yes, this was a typical salad, but the tomatoes were so fresh and the balsamic reduction was so tasty. We asked for a little bit more of this said reduction and they brought out an entire cup of it..whoops.  --Clam Chowder: Hands down the best I've ever had. Not overly thick and creamy, yet perfect proportions of ingredients. Piping hot when it arrived which I really appreciate with soups.   --Mac & Cheese: Ugh my mouth just waters at the thought of this. Served in a skillet, the mac and cheese was perfect consistency: it wasn't drowning in sauce but it wasn't just a bowl of plain noodles with an ounce of cheese mixed in...perfect proportions (once again). On top was a layer of melted cheese that was just fantastic...I think that there were four cheeses or so just in this topper!   --Bone-in Filet Mignon: I really don't like throwing out the \"best I've ever had\" card very often. Because, honestly, how many things can take that title? Well, this definitely takes the \"best filet I've ever had\" title. Join the club, clam chowder. It had the taste of a NY Strip, but was tender as a filet should be. And, to top it off, it is served on a 400 degree hot plate. I like my steak kept hot and this obviously got the job done.   --Warm Butter Cake: Okay, now this piece of heaven really takes the cake (ha, horrible pun intended). My mom and sister are suckers for butter cake (who isn't..?) and we figured what better time to order it than for a birthday? Out comes this large, circular cake and a BEHEMOTH side of whipped cream. Really. View my picture to see how much there was. Think of a frozen skillet just bombarded with thick, heavy whipped cream. Fantastic dessert. And what's even better? Rob comped this $16 dessert with the simple message of \"happy birthday, we're so happy you came in to dine with us tonight.\" Winnnnnnn.  From now on, every time I'm asked for a restaurant recommendation, Mastro's will be the first word to escape my mouth. I cannot wait to go there again next time I've got a few bucks to blow.",

    "text": "Seems like I've been on a steak kick recently, which makes me realize that my stomach and wallet are inversely proportional. After visiting Gordon Ramsay and Old Homestead recently my gut has increased exponentially while my wallet is shrinking dramatically. Mastros, of course, had the same effect.  Our party of four dined family-style and sampled the following:  A dozen oysters (Kusshi and Bluepoint). All were delicious but, personally, I prefer the smaller Kusshi.  The ahi tuna tartare was beautifully presented in a cylindrical stack with, perhaps, too much avocado, but contained plenty of fresh tuna and a variety of textures and flavors.   Ocean Club crab cake. There was very little filler, nice big chunks of lump meat, and a perfectly balanced tartar sauce.  The scallops were too rich and buttery and was drowning in sauce. The accompanying toast was deliciously crisp and cheesy.  The 22 oz bone-in ribeye, cooked medium-rare, was tender and had a decent amount of fat, as was to be expected. A solid steak, but not as mind-blowing as the beef from the top steakhouses around town.  Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. A little dense with a rich, cheesey truffle flavor. Pieces of crab were scarce, but there were plenty of gnocchi for the four of us to share.  Alaskan king crab legs. 5 large legs, slightly warm, with clarified butter and lemon. Each yielded plenty of tender meat.  That was plenty of food for all of us, but we couldn't leave without trying their infamous warm butter cake. It was large enough for each of us to get a few bites. It came with a ridiculously large side of fresh whipped cream. I was expecting the cake to have a very moist texture, but instead it was a bit more firm with a slightly crispy exterior. The flavor was as sweet and buttery as you would expect. As delicious as it was, it's not something that my arteries and heart can take too frequently.  Mastors is pricey, but not as pricey as other steak or seafood houses along the Strip. The atmosphere isn't the greatest either. It is located in the center of a shopping mall, afterall. There's no dim, mood lighting. Just the bright florescent  lights of the mall. The tree house thing looked cool, so request that if you have the chance. We sat just outside of it and it had all the appeal of eating at a food court.  There was also live entertainment in the lounge area when we dined. I had to do a double-take because the girl performing looked like Aubrey O'Day. I didn't stick around long enough to see if she had the voice or attitude to match.  I'm not sure how this Mastros compares to the ones in California that people rave about, but relative to Vegas steakhouses it's a solid option. It's a step below the top ones in town, but is great for seafood and, of course, the butter cake.",

We started with the Ahi Tuna Tartare then moved on to (rare) bone in rib-eye and Kansas City stip. My brother went surf and turf and added the prawn, which was basically the largest shrimp I've ever seen. We rounded out with sides of lobster mash potatoes and creamed spinach.   My only complaint was my moscow mule, which didn't appear to have any ginger beer and was essentially vodka and lemon juice. Overall, the food was cooked perfectly and the service was attentive without being annoying (this is a fine line). It was a great experience and I'm sure it made my brother's day.",

Service was attentive, food was perfect. The quality pairs appropriately with the price.  The crab legs come with three sauces: horseradish, cocktail, and a third that I've forgotten (we preferred the others). The mashed potatoes have a generous helping of lobster and the flavors are pronounced. The sea bass is larger than you'd ever expect; I actually took half home!   We were much too full for dessert, but we still ordered it to go! Mastro's packed a lovely box for us.",

    "text": "On my third trip to Vegas, my main priority was not to get sht-face wasted and it was not to shop until I dropped, but rather it was to eat in a treehouse. And that I did! I was sooo excited to try Mastro's (Mah-stro's or May-stro's?) after hearing ridiculously good things about this place. I made reservations online, and called ahead to request a seat in the treehouse.   Service is impeccable here! Everyone was super nice and friendly. We started with the lemon drop dry ice martini and it was possibly the coolest (pun intended) alcoholic drink I've ever had! The dry ice fizzles over the top and there is a mini tornado in your martini glass!! It tasted great as well! Perfect blend of sweet and tart - with, of course, a kick of alcohol!  To eat, I ordered the filet mignon and we split truffle gnocchi, lobster mashed potatoes and sugar snap peas as sides. My steak was perfectly cooked, silky and tender. The gnocchi and mashed potatoes took it over the top to glutton overload. Those dishes are soooo richhhh and decadent and creammmyyy. Yum. I definitely think I gained 10 pounds that night.   Bad for your waistline, bad for your wallet, but great for your taste buds!",

    "text": "Two vegetarians walk into a steakhouse and walk out thinking, \"That was the best meal I've had in Vegas!!\" So what happened?  After spending the day hiking in Utah and then driving 4 hours back to Vegas, we were tired, disheveled, and hungry. It was our last night in Vegas. My dad had raved about Mastro's mac n' cheese for years. So we decided to have some for dinner!   I admit, I was a little worried that we wouldn't be treated well, being that we were not ordering high priced steaks or seafood. That was definitely NOT the case. We had extremely attentive, first class service the entire time. We decided to eat in the bar so we wouldn't take a table away from steak lovers, and since we were more casual. There was live music, which was loud but not impossible to talk over.   Our waitress was just awesome. She explained to us that the portions of the sides were huge and we definitely could share. We appreciated this since we didn't need leftover food. We ordered mac n' cheese, asparagus, and drinks. I had the paloma, a grapefruity drink. It was good! Not overly sweet. My friend loved her berry lemonade. Bread was brought out and was very fancy! There were different kinds of rolls, crackers, breadsticks, and pretzel sticks. Very yummy!   Our meals came out and WOW... the sides were huge! Our waitress served us everything... and whenever we finished, she came to refill our plates. Very classy! We ordered pomegranate martinis on the way through our meal and again... WOW. They were amazing! Order one! They come in a shaker, and are poured table side. There is enough for more than one. The waitress came over and refilled our glasses as needed too.   We finished every single bite of the mac n' cheese and asparagus. And were full. Too full for dessert. The meal was $100! I can only imagine what it would be with steaks. But it was $100 worth it.   This would be the first place I'd come back to eat at in Vegas!",

    "text": "Located in the Crystals at City Center, you can't miss this place as part of it sits in something that's supposed to be a sculpture called \"the tree\".  The sculpture itself is lost on most.  At any rate, my girl and I were in to celebrate a special occasion and Mastro's just happened to fit the bill for what we were looking for.  We started with Oysters on the half shell along with a Lobster Bisque.  The oysters were a good size, not too briny and of the east coast variety.  The Lobster Bisque was excellent.  Chunks of lobster and the soup itself was neither watery nor too thick but with proper consistency and the temperature just perfect.  Main courses consisted of Chilean Sea Bass for her and the Scottish Salmon Filet.  I put my trust in the chef and opted to be surprised in the preparation of my salmon, and I was not disappointed as everything was prepared exactly as requested.  Sides to accompany the entrees were the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and some sauteed Asparagus.  Drinks to accompany the meal was a nice Sauvignon Blanc (the name escapes me) which went with everything as per recommended by our server.  Service-wise:  very attentive.  Our server ran through all of the specials for the night and answered any questions we may have had including selecting the wine to go with our entire meal start to finish on top of being entertaining.  If a course was complete, someone was present to take the item away.  Our glasses were never empty and staff (including the manager) made it a point to be sure that our needs were met and that everything was fine.  Bonus points for giving us a table right along the edge inside of the \"tree\" sculpture.    Word of warning:  portions are quite generous so either be prepared to share or come hungry.    In short:  Top-notch service, good food, quality that pairs equally with the price.  You will not be disappointed.",

The food was adequate but not spectacular. If you want a spectacular Mastros experience I would suggest going to the Mastro's in Beverly Hills, CA. It is above and beyond anything you'll experience in Las Vegas. I would go back to the Las Vegas location but only after some serious thought and consideration of some of the other steak houses in Vegas.",

At the tail end of our trip we had reservations for Mastro's Ocean Club.  It was pretty grand, let me tell you.  The service is simply superior.  You're not going to get a higher class feeling, especially for being inside a mall.  We had the lobster mashed potatoes and onion rings for the table (the onion rings were AMAZING), and we each ordered a different drink (personally, I ordered Dragon Fire, which was tequila with all sorts of sweets and a jalapeno topping).    Our main meals were all impressive in their own ways.  I ordered the lamb, which was simple and delicious.  My boyfriend ordered the filet mignon, which was cooked to his perfection and would've rated this place 5 starts.  My neighbor ordered the ribeye, and was displeased with the outcome.  My neighbor ordered medium rare for his ribeye, and my partner ordered medium-well for his filet mignon (because he will NEVER eat bloody meat), and my neighbor's ribeye was much more well cooked than the filet mignon.  My neighbor's experience was lackluster, but TRUST ME, had my neighbor said something to the server immediately it would've been fixed ASAP.  My neighbor didn't want to make a big deal, so he just said something at the end of the meal that it was okay, and he ate it, but he wasn't happy with it because of how well it was done.  The server was very apologetic and took the ribeye off our bill.  His girlfriend had the mussels, and she thought they were good but wasn't floored by the textxure.  Mastro's was great, but this is definitely one of the restaurants I go to once because I don't want to have another meal while watching ostentatious women picking out what they want at Balenciaga across the way with a perfect view.  It was annoying.",

He did a standout job as we were waiting for our table to be seated.  Kindly took our request for Rick Astley \"Never Gonna Give You Up\"  AKA 'Rick Roll'd'   Did a fantastic job.  For that the restaurant gets the full 5 star it deserves.  Oh the food?  it was good I had a rack of lamb that was outstanding!  Besides that the lounge singer stole the show! BOoooo yah!",

Waiter was very nice and even scooped some food into my plate when the plate was getting emtpy lol. There was also a guy playing the piano and singing so that was nice too.  I ordered the filet mignon steak and I have to admit, it was one of the best steaks I have ever had. I'm from New Orleans and I have tried all the top steakhouses here like Mortons and Dickie Brennan's but Mastro's tops them both. Meat was tender and was full of flavor.   Pricewise, it is pretty expensive but that is to be expected. Steak was about 55 bucks, sides were about 15 for me. G/f ordered a mixed drink that turned out to be 17 bucks. Total bill for 2 people was around 140.  I highly recommend this place if you want a classy place to eat in Vegas",

Last year our service was so over the top, the food so good, and the unique ambiance made it a great meal.   It was still a great, er good meal. We arrived at 7:20 for our party of seven reservations. Both cabs got lost.   We were seated at 8:30. The management seemed unable to deal with people camping at the table. We suggested they offer to buy them a drink at the bar l get them off their butts and get out!!  Once we were seated, we had the wonderful seafood tower. Our wait staff was good, not great (like last year). Examples is very pedestrian descriptions of the specials or main dishes. Our waiter went through the list rote. Our meals were deliverd together, but several times we had to ask for water, the bus staff made comments and interrupted conversations with their removal of plates. I think bus boys should not participate in table conversation, unless asked.   My bone-in strip steak, ordered charred medium rare was neither, and NOBODY askede if I was satisfied with the steak, which surprised me.  My steak wasn't charred and it was rare.  I know, some people say medium rare and really want medium. I know the difference. I like 120 to 130 degrees max. My steak was rare or actually cool and uncooked in the middle. I'm in the food business and actually run a meat wholesaler. My steak was just so-so, it had some tough parts and the undercooked aspect make me leave at least 30% of the meat on the plate.   The gnocchi and the lobster potatoes are worth the trip.   I'm not sure how to avoid the hour wait for a table, but it was frustrating.   Last year it was a 5 star meal, but due to average service, the long wait, my steak being undercooked and average quality, it was a 3 star night, and it was over $1,000.  Ouch.",

The weird thing about this restaurant is that it's in a mall -- it's a very nice mall, but it's still a mall.  Setting that aside, the food is very good.  We all got filets and they were delicious.  The sides are HUGE, so no need to go overboard on them.  If you can, ask to sit in the \"treehouse\" -- it's a part of the restaurant that juts out over the second floor of the mall, and gives you a \"view\" of the \"mall\" (I know that sounds silly, but it's pretty cool).",

    "text": "My friend treated me to dinner here for my birthday, and it was fabulous.   I would've rated it as five stars, but I had a couple things that bothered me. First, we had a reservation, and came about 15 minutes early so we could grab a drink at the bar first. We checked in, but were not seated until about 20 minutes past our reservation. Not a big fan of having to wait that long past the reservation time. Second, I'm not a big fan of the dress code. It's supposed to be fine dining, and it is a beautiful restaurant. But, the fact that you see customers simply wearing t-shirts and jeans kind of ruins the whole thing.   Other than that - all was dandy. Service was impeccable, but I would hope so considering the amount you pay to eat there.   Food wise - we got oysters as appetizers. They were very fresh and tasted great. The clam chowder we ordered was decent, but nothing to rave about. I've had plenty of other clam chowders that easily beat the one at Mastro's. The steaks we ordered were cooked to perfection, and were complimented well by the sauteed mushrooms.   Since it was my birthday - they did give us free chocolate cake, which was nice. Very light, fluffy, & moist. BUT, we did also order the warm butter cake, which I think most would agree is a must. Man, the chocolate cake was nothing in comparison.   Overall, great place. Would definitely go back again, when I have the money to spare.   And on a completely random note - they do serve Chilean Sea Bass at this establishment, which surprised me. This fish is known to be highly over fished and is on Seafood Watch's list of fish to avoid. Just thought I'd let you know.",

I went for a company dinner so cannot attest to the price (although based on other Yelpers, the cost is quite steep!)  Started with a lovely bread basket with a wide variety of different breads, including \"pretzel bread\" which is quite similar to Joe's Stone Crab bread.  The bruschetta appetizer came next which was VERY oniony, but it's a good thing I'm a big fan of onions because I absolutely loved it.  Caesar salad was just so-so.  Then the main course....I got the mahi mahi in this fancy butter sauce which was excellent, but not as good as my husband's salmon (I almost stole his plate it WAS THAT GOOD).  The fish portions were very large and filling.  Sides for the table included creamy mashed potatoes and creamed spinach.  The spinach was a little salty for my taste, but not grainy at all.  Dessert was cheesecake with whipped cream and berries which was creamy and decadent...A+ even though I was completely full I ate the whole thing.  Would I return to Mastros?  Absolutely.  Wonderful ambience and GREAT salmon.....after all it is an \"ocean club\" so the fish has to be good right?  Cheers!",

For appetizer we ordered the shrimp cocktail /all clean,deveined properly/ and the steamed mussels..let me tell ya..the shrimps are super jumbo..i took 4bites out of one shrimp..the mussels are delicious  with that tasty wine reduction ..actually just that by itself is an entree . For entree we shared the seared scallops and a steak with a side of fries.. The portions are perfect ..but we got full after the steamed mussels so had to take the rest 'to go' ... Also, if u have a special occasion, make sure u tell them ahead as they will get u a super nice piece of cake for u.. ON THE HOUSE. All this deliciousness didn't cost more than $180 ..  Thank u for another pleasant experience Mastro's ..see you soon!",

    "text": "What can I say about Mastro. Easily the best dinner I had on my last Vegas trip, and I know that's not a statement that can be thrown out easily given the steep competition in the area.  We made a reservation for two and was seated in the 'treehouse' area, which was great for people-watching, as many tourists come filtering through the mall, stopping to gawk and try and make sense of this structure that we're dining in. We had the ahi tuna and bone marrow appetizers and both were extremely delicious, the ahi tuna notable for its thick and generous cuts. The fish entrees we had (Arctic Cod and Bronzino) were made to perfection, but left us so stuffed that we had no room to try dessert, unfortunately. Special kudos to their complimentary bread bowl which is undoubtedly the most diverse, delicious, and high-quality 'free bread' I have had in a long time at any restaurant in this price range.  The service was attentive. The drinks were divine. For the fruity girly drinkers like me who still want a kick in their drink, try Tiki Time, which was just FANTASTIC.  Next time I fly back to LV, I'm getting into an Uber and going directly to Mastro's.",

Also the service was not as wonderful as it was in years past. But the most notable part of our experience? The slippery floors! The floors are slippery with grease- absolutely disgusting and especially unsafe for any woman in heels. Someone could very easily slip. And the worst part- the same tile extends   from the entrance of the restaurant all the way into the treehouse. Once you are near the elevators and entrance heading out the door, it is no longer slippery- so it's not an issue of the floor material. It must be grease coming from the shoes of waitstaff in and out of the kitchen. Please do something to clean your floors! Sheesh",

We always order too much but I cannot get enough of the Alaska king crab legs. They serve generous portions, especially of the martinis. I am hard to please when it comes to a dirty vodka martini with blue cheese olives and they do it perfect! The appetizers and sides are all fantastic. Maybe someday I will try a steak here but you cannot go wrong with the seafood. Also location is right across from stores like Gucci and Louis Vuitton so you can have some fun with drunk shopping afterwards. We are already coming back in April again.

My family and I had reservations on Thanksgiving Day for dinner. Our reservations were made for 8:45. So we had already passed the rush hour. My family and I get there and they go to seat us. That's where i get pretty disappointed. They wanted to seat us to what looked like a make shift area. It was away from everyone else dining and we were at a busy traffic area for the employees to go in and out of the kitchen. I asked the hostess who was seating us to please move us to another table. Her smile disappeared and seemed annoyed by it. We walk back up front and she tells the other hostess about my request to be moved , and she looked pretty annoyed as well. I'm sorry but i was not about to be seated in a dark corner secluded from the main dining area as if we didn't belong there. They had many other tables available but they said they didn't have servers for those tables. So to make a long story short, it truly ruined my appetite due to the looks and snarls of the hostesses including the manger that happened to be at the check in table as well. We enjoyed our server , but you could tell that word had gotten around that Missy (me) had requested another table. It felt really uncomfortable the whole evening.",

    "text": "Friday night team dinner with my coworkers at Mastro's. We'd been planning for a while but schedules kept getting in the way. I'm glad we finally made reservations and went because wow. Just wow.   Made our reservation for 5 on OpenTable and when we arrived, we were instantly seated. Our server got us waters while we waited for the rest of our group to arrive, then he went through menu and drinks with us. We ordered drinks and appetizers. While waiting for appetizers, they brought out baskets of bread (the pretzel bread was yummy!). We ordered Shrimp Cocktail and Seared Ahi Tuna for appetizers. I ate some of the tuna, which was amazing.  For main course, we each ordered a meat then a bunch of sides to share. I got the filet mignon. For sides, we got Mac & cheese, black truffle gnocchi, broccoli, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. I couldn't eat the gnocchi, but everything else was flavorful and delicious. Even the veggies had a unique flavor to them! We had leftovers, which we split up (somehow I ended up with a coworker's lamb, which I ate the next day and OH MY GOD I should have ordered lamb...). They bagged everything up for us and then we ordered desserts to share. We got the butter cake, flourless chocolate cake, and one other dessert (I forget!). The butter cake was good, but not my favorite. I loved the chocolate cake, though it was super rich. So yummy.  As far as service, our server was fantastic and attentive. When we first were seated and only ordered waters to start, I think he was a little \"eh\" that we might not be big spenders (and therefore big tippers...), but as we ordered more and more he seemed to friendly up a bit. He also had an assistant who helped quite a bit and constantly refilled our waters and cleared plates as needed.   The ambiance is nice, but it is in a mall (though a pretty nice mall). The main seating areas kind of overlook the mall, so it's a bit \"meh\" but don't let that take away from your experience. The food was great, the service was great... the price was definitely expensive. I'm sure you can eat here without it being as pricey as we made it, but we ordered a LOT of food and drinks.   Really enjoyed Mastro's. Definitely recommend it!!",

    "text": "We made a reservation via OpenTable and though we showed up almost 25 minutes late, they seated us quickly and at a great table in The Treehouse.  The bread basket was fantastic (as is most). There is Epi Baguette, Sourdough, Pretzel, and Cheese Crisp Crostini. The baguette had that wonderful chewy, moist interior, crusty exterior, and a great distinctive flavor.  We started with Fried Calamari ($15) and it's served a little differently now. They drizzle the spicy garlic aioli over the calamari and it's served with a sweet chili dipping sauce along with the usual fresh lemon. I thought it would be too much with the aioli and the chili sauce, but they really complemented each other (though you do need acidity from the fresh lemon juice to cut through the creaminess and sweetness). I would prefer the calamari to not be pre-sauced, but it was still tasty.  The 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye ($59) was decent; it was cooked a tad over our request of medium rare and though it had nice strips of fat around the edges, the cut lacked a lot of marbling. It was still tender and mostly flavorful, so we enjoyed it.  I really liked the cut and size of their Chilean Sea Bass ($51) and it was good, but it didn't have that super buttery texture that I've come to associate with this fish. It was a little disappointing and I'm not sure what attributed to its non-characteristic texture; perhaps overcooked?  As it as been said many times, the Lobster Mashed Potatoes ($38) is absolutely divine! The super creamy potatoes are combined with large pieces of fresh Maine Lobster and finished with a pool of butter. It actually looks more like a buttery lobster broth, but I guess it's just lots and lots of butter! Either way, it's obviously delicious.  Not something we would normally order, I was pleased with the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi ($34). The chewy, pillowy gnocchi is tossed in a asiago alfredo sauce and finished with black truffle and King Crab. All of these flavors worked together nicely and nothing was particularly overwhelming or too heavy.  Lastly, we ordered Sauteed Broccoli ($13). I was surprised how little it was sauteed, however, it was crunchy and a perfect accompaniment to the rich potato dishes and steak.  Since we were here for my birthday, they brought out a complimentary slice of their Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (I believe it's half). Not typically a chocolate cake fan, I loved it! The cake was really moist, wonderful mousse, and I loved the crunchy chocolate shavings and fresh raspberries. It's also served with a mountain of their wonderful fresh whipped cream (there was so much, we thought it was ice cream!).  From the moment we stepped into the restaurant to the very end, service was phenomenal! We were tended to by so many individuals and everyone was on top of their game. Everyone helped each other and we never had a moment of need.  The prices are mid- to high, but the portions are very generous! I assume most people leave with bags (we walked out with a large one as our food would've been enough for 3-4 people). Overall, we had a really wonderful experience and the food was good (above average).",

The ambiance was very classy and the staff is knowledgeable and attentive. Half of the restaurant is a traditional dine-in interior, but you also have the option to sit in a large wooden structure that resembles a nest. It's a little wild, but it gives you something to talk and post pictures about. The food is top notch. Like seriously top notch. The fish is cooked perfectly and most dishes can be prepared in several ways. My sea bass was baked with a herb rub and a parmesan crust, so the bite was crispy on the outside but firm and juicy on the inside; all the bases were covered. The sides are served family style and are a great way to experience the whole menu; my personal favorites were the brussel sprouts and the lobster Mac and cheese. I'm really glad I got a chance to stop in and look forward my my next visit!",

My clients who arrived from Denver around a year ago and never experienced Mastro's previously so I knew they were in for a treat.  We started off with drinks at the table  once we were  seated and were brought the awesome bread basket -  I indulged in the pretzel bread yum! We ordered a few appetizers - scallops, crab cakes and ordered our starter salads. I opted for just the 1/2 salad of the iceberg wedge - it's plenty large and so yummy. For my main entree I went for he rack of lamb and we shared several twice cooked potatoes and cream spinach. Everything was spectacular and the service was stellar! My lamb was cooked to perfection and  my clients were impressed as I expected. The only con was nobody had room for buttercake!  I received a telephone call from Mastrro's the following day thanking me for my business which again is so out of the box. I'm happy to see even with the change of ownership that nothing has changed here!",

We were in town for the weekend and we came here with a party of 4. I always get my filet medium at mastros and it usually comes out at about medium rare to medium because of the plate being hotter than the oven. I got my 8oz filet and about 1/3 was a little too cooked. The meat was great but unfortunately a little over cooked.   Now is the time for BUTTERCAKE. If you look back at my reviews of all the Mastros around the country, I highlight the buttercake every time. Greatest dessert ever. Our other guests never had it, so of course I was hyping it up big time. Our first buttercake was very burnt - inside was completely hard and 2/3s was not edible at all. So we waved down our waiter and he runs back to get another. Second one comes out and unfortunately its the same burntness. By that time, we were over it and just said take it back and take it off our bill. Very disappointed in this - first time ever this has ever happened.",

    "text": "I've been a big protagonist of Mastro's since I first visited their Beverly Hills location almost four years ago. That visit was hands down my greatest overall dining experience with the service and all things considered. Since that visit, I've been here to the Ocean Club twice... both times were special occasions made very unspecial with the experiences here.  I'm not sure if the Beverly Hills location is just so far ahead of everyone else, or perhaps Mastro's being bought out not too long ago was the cause for a dip in overall quality, but I just don't feel the same about this place.   There's nothing imaginative or cutting edge about the menu here. It's typical steakhouse fare... beautiful cuts of prime beef, lobster mashed potatoes, king crab gnocchi, louie salads, seafood towers, butter cake and overpriced cocktails. Among your big hitting steakhouses, execution of the chef and service is what will set you apart.   To my disappointment, Ocean Club LV just doesn't stand out. Both times I've been, the last visit being last month, the service didn't stand out like my first visit to Mastro's.   When I came for my best friend's bachelor party weekend, three... THREE of our 5 steaks were severely undercooked. We got black and blue ribeyes, and they just re cooked the same steaks we had already cut into and gave them back to us. Pretty laughable for any establishment, let alone one that is supposedly of the highest quality.  Came with my fiancee the second time and the service was SO slow. Our waiter was not at all attentive and very difficult to track down the entire night.",

The room is just beautiful, with the careful engineering that dampers the sound so that even when the restaurant is full and bustling you can hold an intimate conversation at your own table.  The ages in our party ranged from a somewhat shy 16-year-old boy to my elderly mother - the servers were attentive, patient, respectful and engaging with all, and put everyone at ease.  The \"high-drama\" cocktails (some containing dry ice for an amazing display) were brought to the table with flair, as was the food which was delicious.  At every juncture we were made to feel that the staff was grateful that we were there - and the phone call the next day thanking us for having dined with them was an elegant and much appreciated touch.",

    "text": "I went here for a work dinner hoping to find a good seafood restaurant In Las Vegas but left very upset with both the dining experience and the quality of the food.   The food: we started out with some alacarte cold seafood. I had the oysters which to my surprise was only served with a cocktail sauce -  not vinegar. A shame for otherwise good oysters. My colleague had the burrata with the heirloom tomatoes, but the cheese was more like mozzarella and the tomatoes un-ripe and hard.  For our mains we went with the seafood - I had the sea-bass (blackened) and to my surprise it  was drenched in butter and tasted more of butter than the fish I was expecting. My colleague had the swordfish - which was overcooked, and cold by the time it came out.  The service: the service was non-attentive and several times the staff walked by not noticing our empty glasses or asking if we would like another drink.   When we got both our apps and our mains the staff served us the wrong courses- we all got each-others dishes.  Lastly - Once dessert rolled around (we had ordered two deserts to share) -we only got two plates which was very inconvenient. After once again waiting for the staff to come around and not noticing we had not started eating, we managed to get some plates brought out - albeit - the plates were hot and miserably watched the ice cream melt as it hit the sizzling plates.  Overall we left Maestros pretty upset with the experience and the food - especially considering we brought our client here for a fun evening.  Follow up: the following day I received a follow up call asking how we found the experience - I told the caller about the experience and I had a manager try to reach out to me after. I will post an update here after I get in touch with them again.",

    "text": "So as we walk into this place I was very skeptical to think that they would produce good food because on the outside all you see if the tree house and you kind of don't understand how to get in here but then we walked in and it finally made sense.we were celebrating our cousins birthday so there was four of us.  So let's start with appetizers we had the crab cakes which here they were your typical crab cakes nothing special but still tasted petty good.  Bone marrow!! I'm telling you it's the business here! They were served with mini toasted bagettes buttered on the grill and the little salad they had on the side was an awesome pairing.I would definitely order it again yummy!  So the waiter recommended that we try the 33oz wagyu tomahawk ribeye and I'm glad we ordered this steak. And for 88 bucks I expected another mediocre steak but boy was I wrong. I asked the waiter when the steak came out if I needed any sauces for this steak and I was thrown off on how he immediately said no trust me eat it as is.. the most awesome steak I've had in my life so far..I was so satisfied from first bite to finish and now look to have this steak on a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fregular.my&s=3bc863090b46da23fb37d8646aa3bc029f5b4897253afc05bc747eff85fe97c8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">regular.my</a> wife also agreed and sister and cousin felt that was a phenomenal steak! Thank you so much for the experience  Our cousin and sister had the rack of lamb and for me I'm not too much of a lamb guy but they insisted that I try it and I was amazed because normally when I eat lamb it's too gamy for me but this was an awesome prepared lamb chop so thank you for that because it totally changed my perspective on lamb.  As for the sides that we enjoyed with our meal we had lobster mashed potatoes and asparagus and cream corn.they went with our meal and I will say my favorite thing was the cream corn and the recommended lobster mash felt like it was just your simple mash potatoes and gravy with lobster on top..still it was delicious  Since we were celebrating a birthday or waiter gave us the also recommended butter cake on the house which was very nice and I think the dessert is not as good as they say. but we all enjoyed it overall the steak is what I will come back for it was such a great meal.",

Server should have worked at norms, he was in a hurry , no specials introduced very little interaction , sat for awhile finally received some bread,drinks were pretty good, wedge salad was swimming in egg, mayonnaise and bacon bits, taste was flat, when wife's petit filet arrived and my 22 oz bone in porterhouse they were over cooked , the greens were sizzling in the pan and went soft in 10 minutes , my steak was uneatable, , wife got 1/2 of hers down , when I requested the check waiter brought it to me and thanked me as he turned to service another customer , weak customer presentation . We usually dine at the restaurant in Newport Beach and everything there first class, Lots of wonderful restaurants to try in Las Vegas , hopefully your visit here won't match ours, maybe they should enforce a dress code as well , baseball hats , shorts on men and pool wraps on women should be discouraged",

I started with a long list and ended up, with Mastro's. And, it was the perfect setting, to celebrate our anniversary.  We travelled all morning. Checked in our hotel and walked all over the strip, during the day. So, we were a little tired, by dinner, but were up, for celebrating, with delicious food and wine.   We had a table, in the \"treehouse\". We ordered a bottle of The Prisoner wine, because we were splurging. It was delicious, and went well with our meal. The bread basket they brought out was this bread lovers dream; huge, wide assortment of yummy goodness, with butter.  We had the crab cake appetizer. The crab cakes were very large, and scrumptious, with not much filling, just lots of crabmeat.  The Lobster Bisque was very nice.  We shared Blackened Scotch Salmon, which was delicious, but thankfully, not huge, cut in half. The lobster Mac 'n Cheese side is sinful.  They brought us a complimentary dessert, for our anniversary. We were able to squeeze in a few bites.  The service was as you would expect, in a higher end, very nice restaurant. Our waiter and all the staff were courteous and helpful.  Without the $100 bottle of wine, the meal was still pricey, but it was worth it. This is a great place to celebrate something/anything!",

They were not labeled as anything but \"sweet potato fries\" but when they delivered them to our table it looked like 2 pounds of battered fries that were not good. Then they called them tempura style. They took them off the bill and were very professional. They even surprised us with an excellent butter cake for a birthday in our party. I would score them higher if it were not for the value for the money.",

    "text": "Ok. I have walked by this place a dozen times in the Crystal Shoppes and always just thought it was a mall restaurant. Surprises in Vegas keep on coming. I checked on Yelp and it was rated pretty high at 4.5 with 589 reviews. The final selling point was that it is open until 1 am which makes sense in Vegas. It is a pain to make it to a show and have dinner finished by 10 pm. A lot of the supposed higher end restaurants could do a lot better job on their hours in Vegas. Mastros does and so it got our reservation. We had a great dinner, the sea food tower was stacked and very well done. Everyone enjoyed their meals, the steaks and fish meals were great and not a complaint was raised at the table. The wine was recommended and reasonable. Not to mention very well paired to the meal. Thanks to Dion (our waiter), for a really enjoyable evening. He made the night work for everyone, even though it started off a little shaky. A bit more attention by the host staff when dropping people in the bar to wait on their table would have earned 5 stars.   However, we would go back in a heartbeat.",

If the food is good and the server is attentive, that is good enough for me.  5 Stars are for the rare occasions both the food and server are over the top good.  Mastro was both.  First Mastro is in the middle of the almost new City Center construction project and mausoleum for the lost profits of Dubai and the MGM Group.  It is a really nice place filled with shops people can no longer afford.  Mastro from the outside looks like a brown tree house in this glitzy cloud.  It is a really beautiful build out with a long and a two dining areas, one in the tree house and one outside said house.  It is a traditional steakhouse with tons of cuts of cow cooked to your liking and ubiquitous sides:  4 different types of spuds, veggies, etc.  I do not eat steak, but most of these places will have one chicken dish and really decent seafood.  I ordered the salad, scallops and split the sweet potato fries.  The salad was huge and could have/should have been the meal, especially after the  box of 6 kinds of different breads.  The scallops really excelled with a Parmesan flavoring, but the hit was my friends Arctic Char, which was perfect....and I mean perfect  Where is there fish that good in a desert?  The waiter was excellent and goaded us into dessert.  We asked him about the Praline Vs House Special Batter Cake.  He said try one as they were his favorite.  He would let us try the other.  Both were phenomenal....  As is this place....Really great food and total culinary experience",

The drinks are aggressively poured (for what they cost, they certainly should be). Dessert was equally impressive and the attentiveness of the wait staff was some of the best I have ever seen.  The dining experience as a whole was in my top 5.  I very strongly recommend this place if you are seeking a top notch dinner in las vegas.  That said, be forewarned that it is also in the top 3 most expensive dinners I have ever had.  The entrees are not really that exorbitant, but when you tie in a side like lobster mashed potatoes for $40 and multiple alcoholic beverages, it gets expensive in a hurry.  Although expensive, the entire experience makes it worth every penny.",

    "text": "Went to Mastro's before a show. Scott was our server and was excellent. Had a full dozen oyster's on the half shell which were just out of the ocean fresh and delicious! I ordered Sea Bass blackened and it was melt in your mouth perfect! The lobster mashed were delish as was the house dessert, Warm Butter Cake, served with loads of fresh homemade whipped cream! Servings are large and we all had leftovers. Loved sitting in the treehouse. We do have a few suggestions: The entrance is so boring and the piano is shoved way back in a back corner that you would never notice it. How about putting the piano up front somewhere? Such a wonderful restaurant needs a a better first impression. Also, we had called and asked for a 7:30 reservation and were told it was not available but 8:30 was. That was too late for us to make our show, so reservationist suggested 7. We arrived and were seated at 7 and the restaurant was no more than half full until past 8 pm!! So why couldn't we have come at 7:30 as we first asked? I mentioned this to a manager who approached our table mid-meal  and he said, \"Well, sometimes things change.\" HUH??? Terrible response. Nevertheless, we loved our dinner and the service was fabulous. We can't wait to go back. We're already saving up!",

    "text": "As a party planner, I do not gratuitously provide 5-Star Ratings. However, I believe Mastro's Ocean Club to be the perfect location for an intimate dinner party in Las Vegas. We booked the private rooms upstairs for a reception and sit-down dinner for a party of 40 on Saturday, September 15, 2012 and our discerning guests who came from all around the country could not have been more pleased with the entire experience.  We were expertly guided from start to finish by Carly Smith, Director of Events. Carly was assessable, professional, flexible and an essential resource regarding local vendors to compliment the comprehensive services offered by Mastro's.  The ambiance was charming and elegant... photos of the gorgeous chandeliers, golden leather seats and flat screens which are viewable on their website, do not do this venue any justice.  We were in full view of the delightfully lit Tree House and even the restrooms which came with very courteous attendants, were a pleasant surprise. Their technology is also top of the line. All we needed to do was bring our slide show on a flash drive and our iPad playlist and our music soared through the rooms and our slideshow displayed brilliantly on two flat screens. Mastro's provided all of the equipment and cords and made it easy for us to make our party truly surround sound fun!  No event is a success without delicious food and this is where Mastro's clearly shines brightly. We started with an extraordinary Seafood Tower and Brochetta during the reception. Guests could not get enough of the Colossal Shrimp and Split/Chilled Alaskan King Crab Legs and the wait staff kept everyone's wine glass full which added to the fun and excitement during the reception. As we moved into dinner, the asparagus tempura seemed to disappear from the tables as guests ordered their choice of salads and entrees. And, talk about entrees...the generous portions of prepared-to-order salmon, chicken, steak or sword fish provided additional shock and awe. Even the side dishes, sauteed mushrooms, sauteed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes were absolutely delicious. In addition to Carly Smith, we also have the highest praise Sherie Ritzler, General Manager, Brandon S., Banquet Captain, as well as, L.R, Alex and all of the wait staff and hostesses.",

    "text": "Went to Ocean club for dinner on our last nite in Las Vegas-had been there before and loved it. Well, this time it was even better than we remembered!  Almost as soon as you sit down, the waiter brings an amazing bread basket with the prize being the hot pretzel bread.  We split the bacon wedge blue cheese salad and my wife had the big eye tuna rare. It was a huge portion of incredible, slightly seared sashimi. I ordered the New York medium and it was perfect medium with no grizzle or fat.  It comes on a plate that is 400 degrees with clarified butter on the bottom. I can honestly say it was one of the best steaks I've ever eaten. Sure its $50 bucks, but I've had lots of crappy 50 dollar steaks in my life and this was worth every penny.  We ordered the side dish that the waiter suggested.-home made gnocchi with either lobster or crap meat and gorgonzola cheese. Maybe the best 29 dollars I've ever spent!  We had a great bottle of merlot and unfortunately, couldn't finish all of  the food so we passed on the amazing selection of desserts but will leave room for one next time. And no, I'm not related to the owners!  Just had a fabulous meal and want to share our experience!!",

(I personally think that Cut has the cold, snobby vibe that I'm referring to)  Highly recommend the whole dining experience, but I also love going to grab a glass of wine at the bar.  The bar has an open feeling that is very comfortable, but with an intimate vibe.  Food is good.  Nicely prepared and cooked to perfection.  Nothing crazy on the menu or super unique so its an easy crowd pleaser.    Price is on target as well for their quality of food. They don't push you to buy bottles of wine or spend a ton of money.  The servers are just there to give you what you ask for.  I never felt pressured to get more food and spend a ton.   By the way, if you're local they have a free dessert!  They're so generous with the portion size and its so delicious.  This definitely helps when I'm deciding where to go.  We love our restaurants that support their locals!",

Worth it!!)  -Good drinks poured generously -Very good service   Cons: -absolutely earsplitting music- so LOUD it's impossible to hold a conversation. In an attempt to create a high energy environment, they have eliminated any opportunity for enjoyable conversation, and drive out a lot of sophisticated people. Bad, bad, bad decision!! PLEASE just play some classy jazz at a reasonable volume or anything except that loud rock and roll. Really a detraction from the establishment's fine qualities, and honestly it ruined our meal.

The servers are on point the entire meal, making sure that every detail of your meal is correct.  I ordered the 19 oz bone in filet and my wife ordered the petite filet. Both steaks were cooked exactly to our liking and did NOT need any seasoning at the table. They were flavorful as they were served. We ordered mac and cheese, mushrooms, and asparagus as our side dishes. The side dishes are large enough to share with your entire table so be aware.  We ordered the seared ahi tuna as a starter and it was delicious. Every bit of it was finished.  We ordered a few drinks with dinner and the drinks were excellent. The lemon drop I ordered was served on dry ice so the drink was smoking, entertaining presentation.  The location of this restaurant is a little odd, smack dab in the middle of a shopping mall in what appears to be a large wooden bong (not sure how else to explain it).  We also received a call the next morning thanking us for dining with them. It was expensive, but excellent and we didn't mind since we were celebrating our marriage.",

He also provide us with a good wine pairing. I was lucky enough to have someone else pay for the bill so all the better.  One thing I would say is that if you want a romantic dinner, this may not be the spot. The restaurant is in the Crystal Mall in City Center, and this place is pretty dead. I guess it will depend on the vibe you are after. I went for a buddy's impromptu wedding, so it was just 4 of us. Definitely one of the best steakhouses in Vegas.",

Our waiter was very tentative and recommend us the seafood platter. The Alaskan Red King Crab Claws & the Jumbo Shrimp Cocktails were awesome.  My Rack of Lamb was cooked medium rare as I requested on a super Hot Plate. Perfect!. The rest of the food and side dishes were great. The only less desirable thing was by the time we got our main course it was 11:40 pm at night.  For sure it was a bit pricey, our bill came to $1200 USD for 6 of us. Overall, it was a good experience. Maybe we will try again an earlier dinner time when we have a chance again.",

The appetizer took FOREVER to appear! Ok, forgiven because it was excellent. Moving on. The steaks, for the most part, were fine except for one which needed less raw. Yes, I said raw! All side dishes are a la carte, so sharing is a must. The dinners are served on near bare plates with no presentation at all, so whatever.  All in all, not bad, but for the price a little bit more effort is in order. I will say our server did her best to cover up the mis-steps and I appreciate that effort.

The Service was top notch, we had a waiter and 2 bussers, while I'm sure they had different tables, they were always there when we needed them. It was like they were our dedicated staff.  The meal was top notch, starting with the amazing bread basket, continuing through the entrees, the family style sides, and ending up with an amazing dessert (which they comped to the table).  The Bread basket was a good start, it had Pretzel Bread, olive bread, a Parmesan crisp, and few other breads. The sides were amazing, they are served family style in surprisingly large portions. We had Creamed Corn (some of the best I've ever had), Creamed Spinach, Lobster Mashed Potatoes, King Crab Gnocchi, and Mushrooms. We also had a few salads to pass around the table, 2 Caesars (one regular and one spicy), Tomato and Onion, and Tomato and Mozzarella. A seafood tower and crab cakes were also ordered, I'm not much of a seafood guy but everyone else loved it.   They entrees were pretty stellar as well, I was splitting the 33oz Wagyu Tomahawk cut with my uncle, but since he was too full from the salads and sides, I had to man up and eat the whole thing myself (the things I have to do). This was one of the best pieces of Cow I've had in my life (and I've had A LOT of cow). It was cooked just a touch under medium rare (perfect IMO), the marbling in the meat was insane, and it came out on a scorching hot plate. I don't know how they cooked it but it was perfect.   Table mates also got the Seabass, A Filet, and a few other meats, I was very impressed with the size of their portions, most places would serve about 4oz of fish, but their filets were about 12oz servings.  After dinner, they brought out a Warm Butter Cake with Vanilla Ice Cream for the table, it was a great end to the meal, and comping it was a nice touch!  I have no clue what the meal ran, but it was amazing. My only complaint is that their bar area isn't the best, if they're going to make you wait 10-20 mins for your table they need more room in the bar. They did however have a great piano player and singer who played a variety from christmas carols to current hits which only added to the amazing meal.  Will I be back, hopefully, especially if someone else is picking up the tab!",

It was cooked correctly, it just lacked flavor (as I'd expect from a bone in steak!).  The lobster gnocchi is always great.  Really enjoyed their wasabi salad (sorry- can't remember what it's called).  The restaurant itself is in a bit of a strange location- it's in middle of the mall. So atmosphere is very bright and you can see the stores while dining.  Didn't really like this setting for eating good steak.",

This is surely not an everyday restaurant for us but it felt so nice to go somewhere fancy for the night. The portions are shareable which was nice since everything was a la carte and a bit pricey, which was to be expected. Our waiter was super friendly and gave some great recommendations since I was so indecisive on the lobster tail or salmon; so instead he convinced me to splurge a bit and get both (which I did). The salmon was delicious and fresh, the lobster tail was a generous size, the mash potatoes were soft and the asparagus was seasoned perfectly. The bartenders have a heavy hand which was nice but I am a slight light weight so I could not hang after that margarita. The food and drinks made for a great night and made our Valentine's day dinner very nice, I highly recommend this restaurant for a special night out or a good treat for that special someone.",

    "text": "Great special occasion spot. Have come here for the wife's birthday last 2 years now and we love it. This time instead of getting a meal we got some appetizers and sushi. For starters we ordered the fried calamari and a special smoked steak bacon. The calamari was delicious and lightly battered and cooked perfectly. The bacon was out of this world, smoked and served with a bourbon maple glaze, I could have ate 5 lbs of it. We got 2 large pieces and we devoured it. Next we had the sushi tower. The presentation is excellent with glass plates on the tower. We had the clear lobster roll, hamachi with crispy onions and the jalapeno tuna sashimi and all were to die for. The lobster roll had nice chunks of lobster in it and is wrapped in soy paper instead of seaweed. The hamachi was my wife's favorite, thin slices of hamachi with a light sauce and crispy onions. The tuna sashimi was as advertise, thin slices of time with a jalapeno on each piece, really good and all the sushi was really fresh. We followed that up with a wedge salad( all the salads here are large enough for 2 but they will do a half if you ask) and we each had a bowl of the lobster bisque. Wedge salad was covered in bacon and yummy. Bisque was brilliant with lots of lobster. Since it was her birthday they threw in a slice of their warm better cake, it's their house special and my wife loves it. Had it last year and I think that the main reason she wanted to go back.  I had the chocolate covered strawberries served with a pile of whipped cream. They were fresh and so very good. Service is always great and professional. Atmosphere is elegant and we love sitting in the tree house. Will definitely be going back next year!",

Save it for a special occasion, big promotion at work, or any other time you either (1) want to treat yourself or (2) want to show off to someone else.   Regardless of which Mastro's you visit, come prepared to spend a few bucks. It's well worth it for the food and normal for a high end steakhouse, but for those unfamiliar with the brand, I didn't want you to be caught off guard. Rough prices: Drinks $20, Appetizers $25, Salads $20, and Steaks $50. They do have items cheaper than what I've highlighted, but also have specials that are much higher. For example, my steak was $144. For my wife and I, dinner was about $350 plus tip (I had a few drinks).   Ladies, be sure to order the Lemondrop. It's not on the menu, but will be made upon request. It's a sweet vodka based drink with chunks of dry ice at the bottom. When served, the drink literally steams over. Attention getting and for the lady in your life, something special.   Lastly, there are a lot of steakhouses in Vegas. If you're reading this, your probably doing what I did. Poking around yelp to compare and see which one was right for me. We ultimately picked Mastro's because they are a chain - and they can't afford to taint their reputation (they are generally in extremely wealthy areas). I've been to several steakhouses in Vegas, and this one seems the most consistent.   Good luck and enjoy!  PS - this is in the Crystals Mall, adjacent to the Aria. It's inside of that wooden treehouse that goes up to the ceiling.",

Located at the shops at crystals on second floor. We were here in the summer just walking around in shorts and sandals. I needed a cold drink. My wife recommended going in but I thought there was no way in hell they would let me in with my Golden girls shirt and faded shorts. It wasn't a big deal, they let me right in. Sat at bar and ordered a few drinks. Drinks are a bit pricey but you probably know that already. Dining at the bar is offered. I wish I hadn't stuffed my face earlier. I wanted a steak but settled for cocktails.   The bartenders were very courteous and made sure to check on us regularly. The highlight for me was meeting my all time favorite NBA player, Magic Johnson of the Los Angeles Lakers. I made sure to go over and say hello. He was very kind. I even named my tortoise after him that's how much I love magic. The summer league was going on and a bunch of NBA management and players were hanging around. I saw a bunch.   Very dark inside the restaurant. Interesting how it opens up into the mall. Next time we will grab some steaks. Great place to hang out and people watch. Happy drinking!",

Server was very good, had great knowledge of the menu and made suggestions. Starters were all great. Lobster Bisque was outstanding as was the foie gras and the mussels. My wife had a sushi roll as her entree and it was really sad. Bland, unappealing... Just boring all around. I opted for swordfish and it was ridiculously dry, I mentioned it, only ate half of it but got to pay for it just the same. Gnocchi with lobster and black truffle was pretty outstanding, too. Beware, it's easily enough for 4 people. Drinks are very good but the prices are pretty out of line. Overall, I'd go back for apps and cocktails but would pass on a dinner.",

I thought the atmosphere would be more dressy but it was pretty casual so its pretty much up to you if you want to dress up or dress down (both welcome). Our waiter was very nice and I like how he checked up on us often. Now let get to the food, I loved how the steak came out on a sizzling hot plate to keep the food hot but my steak was a bit over cooked for ordering medium. So make sure to be specific on how you want it. The sides were amazing I recommend the garlic mushrooms. Definitely will be back.",

    "text": "Ummmm... sorry, Joe's. I think I may have found my new favorite seafood restaurant in Vegas.   Felt like taking the boyfie on a date so we decided on Mastro's with no reservations around 9:30pm. Thankfully, they close at 11pm and had a table available inside the spaceship looking thing. We were both super excited about that :) We were greeted immediately and was given the best bread basket on planet earth. I couldn't stop eating the cheese one!  Ordered: x Seafood Tower w/ Lobster cocktail, Crab cocktail, and oysters - The lobster \"cocktail\" and crab \"cocktail\" are GREAT and worth the price because it comes with a whole lobster in the shell and with tons of crab claws. The cocktail sauce is served on the side so it's a bit DIY. I prefer this SO much more over regular seafood cocktails. The oysters were small and delicious. Super fresh! x Caviar - AMAZING!! For $150, we got an ounce of some super delicious caviar serviced traditionally. Worth the $$$ if you want to splurge on how caviar should be consumed. x Seabass - This dish is served 4 different ways so it's pretty cool that we got to choose :) I wanted the panco-ish breading so we opted for that. The seabass was INCREDIBLE! Cooked to perfection and so tender!! LOVEEEE. x Brussels sprouts - Our favorite vegetables. Pretty large serving so enough to share between 3-4 people, in my opinion. Savory goodness.   We also ordered two gin drinks which were SOOOOOO strong. So worth the money :)   Everything was honestly just so great. It was fun to people watch shoppers in the Crystals. Beautiful space and fabulous food. Can't believe Mastro's is a chain! Don't let that scare you away. 10/10 would come again. Can't wait to try the other dishes!!",

    "text": "I've been to the Mastro's in Costa Mesa several times so I was pretty excited to try this Mastro's. Plus, I've always wanted to dine in the treehouse that they have here! I suggest making a reservation and requesting the treehouse. I guess it's not anything too special, but it is nice being in a different setting that you can't really get anywhere else on the strip.   The service here was excellent. Janene was our server and provided excellent customer service. She constantly checked up on us, refilling our wines and making sure our meals were to perfection.   // FOOD & WINE // Wine- The Prisoner: This wine is a blend of Zinfandel, Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Petite Sirah and Charbono. This wine had so many flavor profiles going on. It also went really well with all of the meat that we ordered. The wine was very smooth with plenty of fruity flavors to it.   Sauteed spinach: Your basic sauteed spinach with garlic. I would rather suggest ordering the sauteed mushrooms.  Scalloped potatoes: It was good, but it wasn't excellent. I would have liked more cheese added to my scalloped potatoes. Also, the potatoes seemed to be slightly undercooked and hard.   Bone-in ribeye: A great piece of meat with excellent meat to fat ratio and amazing flavor. I would definitely order this again.   18 oz bone-in filet mignon: Ordered rare plus, this meat was so tender. Unfortunately it wasn't seasoned that well so I had to add salt and pepper to each bite.   Overall, I enjoyed dining at this Mastro's location, but if I had to choose between this location and the location in Costa Mesa, I would have to choose the Costa Mesa location. The service at both locations were excellent, but I would have to say that I slightly enjoyed the food more at the Costa Mesa location.",

Mashed potatoes, roasted jalapenos and roasted Brussel sprouts were and excellent choice.   The steak was probably one of the best steaks (if not the beat) i've ever tasted. Cooked to perfection, tender and juicy and very flavorful.   jalapenos gave just the right amount of heat.   The staff and management went above and beyond in order to accommodate our party.   Overall probably the beat fine dining experience I've ever had although I can't say that I'm a regular at fine dinning places, much the contrary.   The decor of the restaurant , the ambiance, the food, the staff, the management were all absolutely amazing.   HIGHLY HIGHLY recommend next time your'e in Vegas.",

The 'treehouse' as they call it sits directly in the center so it's very hard to miss.  The wooden structure will catch your eye in a heartbeat.    We made reservations for our group and were seated early.  I would like to give a tremendous thank you to Paul our waiter.  I don't think I've ever been so entertained while receiving the best service anyone could ask for.  He went above and beyond to make our evening memorable.   The table is brought a bread basket which has 3 options. I will say their pretzel bread called my name.  I asked for more in which Paul graciously brought an entire basket of just those.  Fantastic!   I started with the wedge salad.  Perfect and delicious.  The crumbled bacon had a great flavor combined with the creamy blue cheese.  For my entree I chose the Chilean Sea Bass accompanied by creamed spinach, Gorgonzola mac and cheese and Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi.  Of course all of the sides are huge and were shared between all of our group.  The sea bass was so light, fresh and baked perfectly.  The gnocchi was a disappointment.  I don't think there were any crab pieces in this. But the other two sides definitely made up for it.  They were so creamy.  Anything with Gorgonzola will make me happy. Simply delicious!  If the appetizer, bread basket or main meal didn't fill you up, they have a great dessert list.  On top of that list is their signature butter cake.  It's topped with vanilla bean ice cream with strawberry drizzled around the cake.  It's calorie free and fat free... In my dreams! It's moist and delectable.  After the huge meal, I would suggest splitting this huge cake.    Mastro's delivered an impeccable meal with first class service.  It was surely a memorable evening!",

So, we ordered the smoked salmon appetizer for starters, blackened chilien seabass, a 12oz medium bone in filet, herb roasted chicken, garlic mash, creamed spinach and the Gorgonzola mac n cheese. OMG! Everything was delicious. We all ate off of each other's plates so we sort of had the whole surf and turf combo going since we all order different main dishes.   Of course we couldn't without saving some room for the delicious warm butter cake which is like no other cake I've ever had. Served with best wishes to me and my best friend by Lionel. He was great and I won't forget him. He made my first dining experience at Mastro's very well worth it and I hope every time I go the environment and culture is the same.

Also, I made a mistake of only tipping 10% tip for 6 people and I was going back to give them the cash for the rest but I was too far away by that time but I saw that they changed it to 18% and charged to my card.

We started off with crab cakes. Yes, pedestrian. But I was starving and wanted to keep it simple with my G&T.   We dove straight into the giant grand seafood platter. It was delicious and amazing. But I was slightly disappointed. The Dungeness crab was a bit salty. (I mentioned it to our server, he admitted they boil it in salted water. I felt they should dial it back. Dungeness is briny on its own. I suppose it's okay to put it in a lightly salted water for preparation. But maybe it was a bit much?)  Then for the final blow: Kobe beef with foie gras and lobster mashed potatoes. Yeah. Stick a fork in me. I was sick with regret a half an hour later. But I did enjoy it! The steak was perfectly medium rare and so tender I nearly didn't need a knife. Truly amazing.",

I luv that it's next to Van Cleef & Arpels, Christian Louboutin, & Fendi. Eat, then shop to the 9s to work it off...  By the time the ice cream butter cake & choclate cake circulated, I was FBR (full beyond recognition).  Our group was sooo stuffed, we shut down the restaurant and literally popped out of our dresses.  Thanks goodness I wasn't wearing one of my Herve Leger dresses, hahaha LOL.",

    "text": "This is top notch dining. Located in Crystals at Aria on the 2nd level. Five of us came to celebrate a birthday last night and we requested the \"tree house\". This is a wooden structure which almost floats in the air, very unique for sure.   We were seated in the center and were lucky enough to get Paul as our waiter. Paul is everything in a waiter you could ever ask for. Knowledgeable, very attentive, funny and yet professional giving us excellent service during our meal.   He was helpful when selecting wines as well as explaining the menu. I ordered the dungeness crab cocktail and the 22 oz bone-in ribeye. I love seafood and was planning on the seabass but couldnt resist the ribeye. Our table split sides of gorgonzola mac & cheese, creamed spincach and Gnocci with alaskan king crab.   The crab cocktail was excellent. Served in a dish with 2 sauces and dry ice it comes out smoking. It was about 10 large pieces of crab ($28). The ribeye was also very good ($58), although a tad to fatty for me. It had good marbling like a ribeye should but parts were a bit too fatty. 3 of us ordered our steaks medium rare and they all came out rare. Beware they do tend to undercook  a bit, but we all finished them as the meat was so good.   The gorgonzola mac and creamed spinach ($14) were both really good. We were a little disappointed with the gnocci however ($33). I found very little king crab in the dish but the flavor was there. For dessert we ordered 3 of Mastro's famous butter cakes which come with vanilla ice cream.   Paul was nice enough to personalize one of the plates with a \"happy birthday\" written in chocolate. The butter cakes were awesome (and quite large). They can easily be split  between two or three people.   Mastro's provided us an excellent meal with outstanding service. The steaks could have been cooked a little longer but with that being about the only flaw the 5 stars are well deserved.",

Great atmosphere and impeccable service not a second went by that our table was not being tended to refreshed or checked on to make sure everything was to our standards. From the Siberian caviar, west coast, and east coat oysters to the lobster and plentiful sides. Each bite was flavorful and delectable. The mouth watering lobster hardly needed anything added not even melted butter due to it melting already on your mouth from tenderness. The creamed spinach was packed full of flavor all the way down to the shuttle hint of garlic and don't forget the creamed corn. And you can't end your night without having the butter cake. Let's just say I died and went to heaven with each bite. Mouth watering melting you mouth warm butter cake topped with vanilla iced cream and fresh berries!! Need I even say more. Hands down fully impressed and satisfied.",

We had the shrimp cocktail at the bar and it was outstanding. I loved their Moscow mule and my husband was very happy with his vodka martini chilled with caper berries. When we sat in the treetop, we had an amazing dining experience as well.   You can't go wrong with seafood or steak when dining at a Mastro's.

The dreamberry cocktail was outstanding. Most of us ordered steak of course which usually comes out pipping hot but this time it was luke warm at most. Although we did not voice our complaint none of us were happy with our steaks. The sides were good, creamed spinach and macaroni and cheese. I'm saddened to say I dont think we will be coming back any time soon. I believe we will continue with Stripsteak at the Mandalay Bay which is Excellent.",

Speaking of the ribeye was humongous and melted like butter.  The rack of lamb is actually 2 racks which the waiter kindly had the chef slice for me so I didn't have to feel like I was performing surgery in the middle of my date. This had to be the best lamb I've ever had.  The food was soo good that we made a special trip back to the aria before seeing Ka at the MGM.  (PS my feet paid the price)",

    "text": "Yay - I've always wanted to eat in the Tree restaurant inside City Center! :D  Unfortunately, we were not actually seated inside the tree, but tis okay! Our group of 5 (3 other girls were too drunk to make it, but anyhows), was seated near the door. Hint - if you are seated along the wall, make sure you sit in the booth with the white plush walls. Awesome to lean your head against!  Our waitstaff was superb, although I was a bit sad when they didn't offer any comp things for our meals taking so long! Womp. Also, our table was super dim, we could barely see each other.  As a party of 5 girls (and our first and only meal of the day), we had:  * Seafood tower w/ oysters, claws, jumbo shrimp, crab. Uhhmaaayyyzing. Get this. Pick whatever you want. I'd go without the oysters as they clocked in about $5/each and were not mind blowing. DEFINITELY get the jumbo shrimp - they were huge and already peeled! There are few things better than that in the world.  * Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocci. UMMMM I am OBSESSED w. this dish. So buttery, so creamy, so YUMMY! I could not stop gobbling this ish up.   * Lobster Mashed Potatoes - nomnomnom! Had huge chunks of fresh luscious lobster nestled within the creamy mashed potatoes. Fan!   * The special 32oz kobe steak, cooked medium rare. This was perfection. $98 worth of absolute perfection. The steak was a perfect pink and melted in my mouth. The leftovers even tasted amazing.   * Chilean Sea Bass, blackened per our waiter's recco. Unfortunately, I didn't love this dish....so i don't really have much to say about it. I think it had more to do with the way it was prepared (I generally don't have my fish blackened) than the fish itself - but not impressed.  Two girls split a bottle of red vino for just $33 - surprisingly priced at such a nice resto.  At the end, our bill came out to just about $100 pp. Pricey - definitely, but I think it's worth it! Make sure to request a tree house table!  Oh - at the end of the meal, our waiter gave us to-go sippy cups for the rest of our vino! He also jokingly asked if my drunkie friend would also like a cup of agua to go ;) puuahaha",

We were seated in the half booth half tables that are right next to the bar. You know, the ones that are right on top of each other. I was annoyed, because I would think they would save these seats for walk-ins. I was determined to not let that upset me and I'm so happy I didn't. Our waiter was awesome as was our food. They bring this beautiful bread basket with a variety of wonderful fresh bread, served with butter of course.  We started with the colossal Dungeness crab which came out with dry ice so it was smoking. It was pretty neat. The crab was very fresh.  I drank water, but my ordered a double shot crown and coke. There was so much crown when the waiter brought the drink that he couldn't put but a splash of coke in it (sodas come in little aluminum bottles). I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and my husband ordered the 12oz filet. We shared the garlic mashed potatoes and mushrooms. My sea bass was cooked to perfection and it was huge, I couldn't even finish it.  My husband's filet was cooked perfectly and had a lot of flavor.  The mashed potatoes had a soft garlic flavor. They were my husband's favorite. The mushrooms were sauteed with rosemary. I've never had mushrooms with rosemary. It was a new flavor for me and I liked it. Our waiter brought us the butter cake for dessert complimentary for dining with them. This was my favorite. It came with a ginormous side of homemade whipped cream. It was the greatest, most delicious thing I've had. I've been dreaming about it ever since! I love this restaurant and have told all my friends and family about it. Definitely going back!",

    "text": "After living in Vegas for about a year, this is easily the most disappointing high end meal I've had.  I'd give the food a 4/5 but the service was probably a 1/5.  Service The first disappointment was waiting.  We had a reservation and even so I can understand waiting by the bar for a few minutes.  However, we wanted far more than a few minutes.  Our \"leader\" went up to the front to inquire and they said on someone will be by shortly to seat you.  That didn't happen so we had to check back again and someone gave us the apology of \"oh, I'm sorry I thought they came and got you.\"  Maybe a miscommunication, but certainly something that could be excused.  However, things didn't get better from there.  It seems like about 10 minutes from when we seated until we even got drink menus, then another 10-15 before the drinks arrive.  Easily 15 minutes before bread arrived at the table.  It just felt like everything was so slow.  After the first round of drinks came our waitress or waitresses seemingly disappeared.  I mean when you have a table of 10 people ordering rounds of $15 cocktails or better you'd figure service would be fast.  I think they easily missed out on  at least 1 extra round due to the slow service.  If you look at the prices at Mastro's and compare it to other places across town, you would expect to have a waiter or waitress that knows the menu back and forth and can describe all of the stars.  We got none of that.  I would say our service was at the level of an average chain restaurant.  You aren't adding any value when you ask about menu items and the waitress just lists 3 things that are \"good\".  We asked how the steaks come and the reply was something like \"what do you mean\"?  I mean are they seasoned, sauced, dry aged?  There is no explanation on the menu or listing of sauces or accompaniments for the steaks....\"oh yeah, they are seasoned and broiled\"....thanks.  This was followed up with no description or explanation of any sides.  During the meal we couldn't even locate the waitresses and people were still anxious to get more drinks.  I will say that the food was good.  The steak was unique in the regard it was so warm when it came out.  Usually food has somewhat cooled but their steak still had a sizzle and was warm for the first few bites, pretty good.  The asparagus was nothing special.  The lobster mashed potatoes were good but at $40 can be steep for a side dish.  Crab gnocchi was good, but I'm not crazy about gnocchi so I'm not an expert.  The problem in Vegas is that you can find a place equal to Mastro's food wise with probably lower prices so suffering through bad service can be a deal breaker.  Needless to say, nobody ordered dessert or drinks after dinner.  With so many other options in town for steak I probably wouldn't come back for that.  I will say I tried the ahi tuna sashimi which seemed great for under $40.  I didn't try it but the swordfish looked the same.  I would come back if I was in the mood for seafood but would be nervous about the service, maybe with a smaller party and a better table things would be better.",

Heard about the great seafood - so tried it for appetizer (husband) also had for dinner but I was looking for a steak. The food was great - service was wonderful and I know have to wait way too long for my next serving of their warm butter cake!    Thanks for wonderful evening.",

Something triggered my wife's food allergies (one reason we'd been frequent diners here was that it had always been \"safe\".)  As soon as she began to feel ill, I called to our server, explained the problem and asked for the check so we could get her to the room and get her a shot of her medication.  TWENTY MINUTES LATER he comes sauntering over and casually drops it off as if he hadn't a care in the world.  He didn't. My wife did.  I tipped shallow, and now regret having tipped at all.  Lots of other choices in Vegas...",

The original number we 12, and I called 3 days before and had no problems getting a table.  By Saturday night, the number had ballooned to 16.  I was nervous about calling to change the reservation, but Mastro's called first and offered a private room which made it even easier to up the number to 16.  Many thanks to the Hostesses at Mastro's for being so easy to work with.  The service is here is friendly and confident, they know what they are doing.  The food continues to carry that confident theme.  Big, bold, and flavorful, the steaks here are serious...no sides to cover them up.  They are served to you \"naked\" with nothing else on the plate.  Sides can be ordered for the table and the sides pretty much all delicious.  Back to the steaks...Charred and flavorful on the outside, juicy and savory on the inside.  My mouth waters just thinking about it.",

    "text": "Party of 8 on a Tuesday night. Interesting set up - there is a part of the restaurant that looks like a large wooden hornet's nest.  Not sure what that's all about.    Service was impeccable from the hostess to the main server to his assistants.  Everything was prompt, polite and timed well.  We were not rushed out even though we were one of the last parties to leave.   Food: I ordered the Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese $12 and the Rack of Lamb $48.  The mac and cheese was a little disappointing - very little flavor and it was dry,  very dry.  I had read that this was a great side dish so I was sad when it wasn't very palatable.  The portion is huge - consider sharing it if you do.  It easily fed our entire table.  I asked for the Rack of Lamb medium rare and it came out closer to medium.  Regardless, the flavor was very smooth, not gamey.  The outside was a little too charred, but the rest of it was quite good.  It came with mint jelly, which was very tasty.  We also had a Heirloom Tomato and Burrata salad $12 which was a very generous portion - the tomatoes were sweet and juicy.  The table got the Seafood Tower (have no idea how much that was but it was worth it).  This was friggin amazing.  Honestly.  There were Kumamoto oysters, fresh dungeness crab, snow crab legs, humongous shrimp, great big lobster claws.  All fresh and tender meat.  It didn't require sauce.  None of it was briny or sandy.  So delicious and whatever we paid, I don't care.  It was unbelievable. Other people in our party got the Arctic Char \"oreganato\" style, bone-in filet, seared scallops and halibut.  Every dish was served with mushrooms, asparagus, green beans and creamed corn (this had to have crack in it b/c creamed corn never tasted so good.)  NO ONE had a single complaint and EVERYONE finished what they ordered.  By this time, we're all about to pass out from food coma, but we insisted on the BUTTER CAKE.  If you come here, no matter what you order, you MUST save room for this signature dessert.  I can't even describe it but it is amazing.  It comes out warm, w/ freshly made whipped cream and vanilla ice cream.   MUST.  MUST.  MUST have.    Overall, great experience.  Cost us a total of $1400 for 7 people.  You do the math.",

There were 4 of us & we ordered the following to sharekids:  Appetizer:  Seafood tower (amazing) Escargot (I can't comment because I don't eat it, but the others agreed that it went well with the puff pastry it was served with)  Main Courses: Tomahawk Wagyu Steak, Scallops & Lobster (all very delicious)  We were so stuffed, we couldn't even look at the dessert menu.   Service: could've been better. Our waiter seemed to be occupied with a larger party & when he would walk by our table, I noticed he didn't look our way to check on whether or not we needed anything. We nearly had to flag him down every time as he passed us quickly. Large table, small table, which ever it may be...needs equal amount if attention. Especially if you don't want your tip to start decreasing.   The minus 1 star is for their lack of service & their water selection (still or sparkling). Some are OK with tap & it wasn't at least offered.",

The restaurant is beautiful, we dined at the tree house and it was a great experience. It's located in the center of shopping center connected to the Aria.   The service was impeccable, the waited was very attentive. The waiter was constantly checking up and cleaning the area. All the employes around the restaurant are on their toes, checking everything is running smoothly.   The food did take a whole to be brought  out. My steak was cooked fine, but my friends was left too rare. We had the lobster mash, sauteed spinach, and the green beans. Overall, I wasn't blown away with the food. Maybe my expectations were set really high because I've heard so much hype around the restaurant.   My favorite food item was the tuna tartar we got as an appetizer, I really recommend it.   I would say come here for the experience, I wasn't blown away from the food.",

There was live piano playing and singing so it was a pleasant wait.  Dinner was good and the service was good.  I got the bone-in rib-eye and it was good. It was tender, juicy and flavorful.  Sides: Creamed Corn Creamed Spinach Garlic Mashed Potatoes Sauteed Mushrooms  All the sides were delicious. It's family style so the servers will initially go around and ask if you want a serving and will serve you.  It was an amazing birthday dinner and I would come back here if I ever get the chance.",

    "text": "So I am a huge fan of Mastro's and frequent their Costa Mesa and Newport locations. I gotta say that this was pretty close to the CA locations, minus a few minor details. From the pretzel bread to the seafood tower appetizer, I was pleasantly reminded of home sweet home (OC). The atomic horseradish is the perfect paring with your chilled seafood, and that is the perfect way to kick off you meal at Mastro's. I ordered my usual bone-in ribeye and sides of lobster mashed potatoes, creamed corn, grilled asparagus and creamed spinach - all were pretty good. The finale AKA warm butter cake, is where they finally dropped the ball. They brought it out and it was cold. Now this is a dessert that you absolutely must eat piping hot, and considering I had just ordered a dinner for 9 people and 2 bottle of Caymus, was not too thrilled at the anticlimactic ending to my meal. The service was great and I would definitely eat here again. Maybe was just a minor miss on the dessert? Anyways, Mastro's remains my favorite steakhouse and I will definitely give it another shot next time I am in Vegas.",

    "text": "Let's begin with, this location is in the middle of a mall.. which alot of other reviewers have brought up i know - but it's the main reason for 4 stars instead of 5. It does get a bit loud and the view is of a shopping mall.. a high-end shopping mall, but still. Not my ideal view for a such an awesome spot. It is what it is though!  The room itself is very nice, lots of seating, lively atmosphere, great looking staff. I have been a couple of times now and the service is always great when I have gone and the food spectacular.   I have ben to Ocean Club a couple of times, but this most recent visit was a dinner of 'Dungeoness Crab Cocktail', 'Ribeye' and '10 oz Ahi Sashimi' . We shared everything with a side of sauteed spinach .. and a few martinis. :) I loved was the personal style serving from the individual pans that the food items were seemingly prepared in. The service staff has always been very pleasant and makes the experience very comfortable.   The Ahi was fantastic with a really beautiful presentation laid out on a long plate with a finish of a really tasty sauce. The ribeye was prepared expertly, perfect medium rare with still  a beautiful grill flavor. The spinach was .. spinach, sauteed.. but was excellent nonetheless! haha.. I was having such a great time and enjoying the vibe of the place overall.   There was a piano player in the corner of the room playing standards and old-school vegas tunes.. Sinatra and the like. It gave a beautiful feel to an elegant style dinner. My friends and I aren't the most refined diners, but we know how to have a good time, and Maestro's made us feel welcome within that setting.  Now don't get me wrong... this ain't your downtown steakhouse with a $4.99 steak special.. you WILL drop a pretty penny to have some seriously tasty grub.. but I do believe it's worth it.  At over $150 a head when we dined there last, it was worth the money but definitely be ready for a big bill. It's nearly unavoidable.   Have a great time, and happy eating!",

Super sushi rolls... Excellent seafod..... An extensive wine list  Buttercake with real whipped cream for dessert ...... oh yeahhhhhh  The location is very unique, in that you can sit out on a terrace in an art deco treehouse and under some beautiful chandeliers. The service is very good, the wait staff is very knowledgeable and friendly. We had an enjoyable evening topped off by a table visit from Lucianna, the manager.  We were recommended to enjoy \"Earthquake\" an excellent Cabernet Sauvignon from the Lodi vineyards, California. I would pass that recommendation on to you - if you are enjoying the fine steaks.......  It is an absolutely supurb wine selection.  At first I was sceptical of the Lobster mashed potatoes, but the  dish is a real treat....  and the portion is so huge that it can be shared by all at the table. A totally unique sidedish... containing an amazing amount of lobster   Don't miss dining here.... I think this is one of the finest dining experiences you can enjoy while in Las Vegas.  I can not wait to return.",

Too much crammed into one space in the middle of, what feels like, a mall. I wouldn't pay the prices again for the food quality. It was good and had good flavor and service was good. But it was not anything amazing. We had the crab legs, the KC ribeye, creamed spinach, and scalloped potatoes. It was good food, like I said, but I would never pay the high prices for it again.",

The Ok - Lobster Mashed Potatoes, sounded better then they tasted.  I wouldn't recommend this place and i will not be coming back.",

    "text": "Visited this superb restaurant on Sunday.  Hostess & Wait staff were terrific.  The menu is a little bit overwhelming, but my friend highly recommended the bone in Filet.  SO I think more than half or our party of 10 did just that.  Also, the sides are served family style.  We had several different sides & all were delicious.  Just to let you know about the service.  I ordered the bone in filet medium and when I received it, it was bordering on well done.  When the waiter came back to the table (within a couple of minutes), he noticed that I was not eating and asked if there was a problem. I informed him that the filet was overcooked for my taste and he immediately picked it up and said he would bring out a 18 ounce (I had a 12 oz).  I told him that he did not need to do that, but he insisted.    It did not take long for me to get my filet brought back out and this time it was perfect.  He apologized again.  I didn't think I could eat all of it, but after the first taste, I realized that I was not going to let this go to waste.    If you go here, I would for sure get a reservation.  Also, be prepared to spend about $60 - $80 per person.    Side note, one of our friends in the group had a birthday, and he was treated with this delicious chocolate moist cake.  I mean it was terrific.  It came with a big bowl of whipped fresh cream.    If you are in Vegas, you need to try this place out.  I have eaten many steaks in Vegas, but this one has been the only one that has satisfied me.    Dress code is business casual, but I am sure if you wanted to walk in with shorts and a t-shirt they will take your money.",

We had a drink at the bar while waiting to be seated and Randy served up an awesome Lemon Drop martini for me and a Key Lime Pie martini for my wife. We had the grilled salmon and ahi tuna sashimi, so good. And as many before me have said here, the signature butter cake dessert is phenomenal. Finally, a comment about service. Kudos to the entire staff and management are due. We walked up to the hostesses and we were welcomed by big smiles. Then off to the table, from the bar, and the hostess carried the drinks for us. Robert, our waiter, and a host of other men with bread and water and what ever we needed made this one special dinner experience. Thank you and see you again soon.",

    "text": "I'm a fan of the Mastro's steakhouse in Costa Mesa, but this was my first visit to an Ocean Club location.  My expectations where pretty high, although I must admit I was not particularly thrilled with the location deep inside Crystals.  However, from start to finish, this was really a first-rate experience.  Service and food were top-notch.  I even had a follow-up call from the GM the next morning to make sure everything was to our satisfaction (which it most certainly was).  I was particularly impressed when, after ordering a bottle of wine which they initially indicated was out-of-stock, the sommelier was able to hunt a bottle down for us. It was this type of service and their overall attention to detail that really impressed me.    Normally, I stay at Wynncore, so if I had not been staying at Aria on this particular trip, I am not sure I would have made the trip up here.  Now that I've experience the Ocean Club first-hand, I won't hesitate to book a return visit.",

    "text": "Mastro's Ocean Club is one of the high end dining places that has opened up in the last year or so at Crystals which is part of City Place.  Technically speaking Mastro's is a chain, though it doesn't carry the chain vibe.  The locations of the handful of Mastro's that exist live in high end cities like Scottsdale, AZ, Beverly Hills, CA and Chicago, IL.  This location in Las Vegas was tagged with the words \"Ocean Club\" to show off the fact that not only do they have steak but a large selection of seafood too.  Steak is what Mastro's have built themselves up as and if you are thinking about dining here I would suggest the steak.  They are famous for firing their meats in an oven that burns hotter than 1100 degrees F.  I ordered the bone in ribeye that I split with my friend.  We did the usual recommendation of medium rare and in my opinion it came out perfect, though it was too bloody for her and she sent hers back to be cooked more.    Of course Mastro's is a la carte and buyer beware the sides are HUGE.  One side order can be spit by 3 people.  We ordered the grilled brussel sprouts and they brought them out piping hot still in the skillet and put the skillet on the table.    Wine selection is wonderful.  Though the food is pricey the wine prices are affordable with decent bottles for only $27 though they go way up in price.  Dessert was a chef's creation at this Mastro's in Vegas (executive chef Wayne Schumaker) which is the signature warm butter cake.  This is a large piece of butter cake that has a sugar crust that is baked hot along with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and a pile of homemade whipped cream.  OMG ridiculous good but again could be shared with like, 5 people.    The only major downside to Mastro's is the music.  They have a live piano bar that you think would play soft, classy music like jazz or piano but instead you get very loud, karaoke type performances by an older man and woman (ages 60+) who use an iPad connected to the piano to sing modern and past day pop music such as Pink, Katy Perry, and even Foster the People's \"Pumped Up Kicks\".  If Mastro's would lose the cheesy, loud, awful music they would go to 5 stars.    Bring headphones and enjoy a nice dinner.",

Truly, the fish was so fresh I would not be surprised if it had been caught that very same day.  The seasoning on all the food was perfect, and I didn't have to add salt, pepper or anything.  Truly tantalizing.  The portions were also large.  The potato was definitely big enough to split with at least one other person.  To top off my experience, someone from the restaurant actually called me the next day to ask how our experience was!  That was a first for me, and I was majorly impressed.  The next time I go back to Vegas, we will definitely be stopping in at Mastro's again.",

The restaurant itself is located inside of Crystals in an open area of the shopping center. Despite the open area, the atmosphere was still very nice and the live music really added to it.  My Experience: Starters -The bread was pretty good -The Shrimp Cocktail was delicious and the horseradish was spicy!  Main Course & Sides -I ordered the Filet, and having dined at another steakhouse earlier in the week, I must say, the filet here was incredible. This was probably one of the best filets I have ever had! -The sides were just as amazing. We had the mac and cheese, green beans with almonds, mashed potatoes, and creamed corn. I would recommend all of them as there wasn't one I did not like.  Dessert -I'm not a huge sweets guy, but I was told that I HAD to try the Butter Cake even though we were already stuffed. It definitely lived up to the hype as a MUST TRY dessert!  Overall, I had a great dining experience here. Our waiter was awesome and we never felt rushed. I would HIGHLY recommend trying this place next time you are in Vegas!",

He helped with pairing the best wines with our entrees. I was so impressed! To top it off, the managers Aaron and Daniel came to make sure everything was perfect. Our entrees were spot on perfect! I will come here every time I come to Vegas. Best steak I've ever had!!! Best service I've ever had! Love it!",

    "text": "We wanted to try a fancy steakhouse on our trip to vegas and Mastro's did not disappoint.  the rodeo was in town that weekend and we saw lots of happy looking cowboy types (i assume they know good beef).   i had the smallest filet and it was perfectly cooked! the meat was delicious. the rub on the outside i felt was the tiniest bit too salty but i can live with that.   the mac n cheese was so rich. i got the half sized portion but ended up taking half of it home. it was still delicious days later.  we also had a healthy side of broccoli was steamed nicely. can't complain about that.   the one thing that did sort of bother me was that the cokes were served in tiny 8 oz bottles. at 4 bucks a pop the refills can add up. if i had known this i would have gotten an iced tea instead. so i'll dock a star for that.  this place is pricey and i'd return but only if i was ok with spending special occasion amounts of money.",

    "text": "Five stars all the way :)  My boyfriend and I came here for our one month anniversary, and it was an incredible dining experience. He ordered the Filet, and I ordered to Chilean sea bass. Both were cooked to perfection. We got the gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the salt and vinegar fries. The mac and cheese was EXTREMELY cheesy, so order it only if you love cheese. Our server was fantastic, and gave us a FREE buttercake topped with ice cream for our anniversary!   TIPS - Get the lemon drop! It was delicious, and so worth it because there is enough for two full glasses.  - If with a small party, ask the server if he can make the sides half sizes. i had no idea they could do that, but our server did it for us. (And we still had leftovers!)  - Sit in the reehouse",

Others complained about feeling like you are in the middle of the mall, but it didn't bother us.  Our server Leonel was attentive and very personable.  Outstanding service and he had a sense of humor!  We started with the shrimp cocktail which was fantastic. Sometimes the really jumbo shrimp are chewy but these were tender and tasty.    Hubby's filet was cooked perfectly and the Mac n cheese is to die for.  I was craving some crab so I had 2 king crab claws of the appetizer menu.  Wow!  Of course you can't go to Mastros without having Butter Cake.  OMG!  It's like no other.  Great meal for a great date night!",

    "text": "Before heading out for a night of partying at XS, my buddy and I found ourselves wandering around the Cosmopolitan looking for a good restaurant to try.  While the rest of our friends were grabbing dinner at the literal hole-in-the-wall pizza counter upstairs, we wanted to take advantage of the opportunity of trying something a little more unique.  Well, that is, assuming we could find somewhere that didn't have a crowd; each of our first few tries were met with wait times of 45 mins or longer.  Hoping for better luck at the mall at City Center next door, we eventually worked our way over to Mastro's Ocean Club to check things out there.  Greeted by a friendly hostess and the opportunity for immediate seating, our search came to an end.  Score for table seating by the bar!  For a while now, I've heard a number of good things about Mastro's from friends in LA.  From the service to the food, they've all mentioned how great their experiences were.  At the end of my meal, I could certainly see what they mean.  After perusing through the menu of seafood and steaks, I ended up going with the grilled Chilean Sea Bass with a side order of the Garlic Mashed Potatoes for my friend and I to split (rather, I wanted it for myself, but needed to \"share\" it to justify getting it).  Now, I know...ordering a fish dish on my first ever trip to Mastro's is pretty counter-intuitive considering their reputation as a steakhouse.  However, given that it's one of their two Ocean Club spots, I figured that maybe I should give the seafood a shot since I don't know if it'll be as readily offered at their pure steakhouse spots.  When our orders were brought to our table, I have to admit that it wasn't stunning at first glance.  Although the cut was larger than I had anticipated (which is never a bad thing), there wasn't much in terms of frills and dressing.  Since everything is a la carte, you literally get just the fish on the plate, with half a lemon on the side of seasoning.  Despite how lonely it may have looked though, there's no questioning the quality.  Although Chilean sea bass is generally more forgiving when it comes to cooking because of its fatty nature, this one was done perfectly regardless.  The meat was soft and tender, and it was moist throughout.  Flavor-wise, you couldn't ask for much more - modest seasoning to it, with a great buttery and velvety sort of flavor from the fish.  Excellent.  As for our sides, the Garlic Mashed was pretty good.  I liked the consistency (thick, but not gloppy or too thin), and the flavor wasn't too potent.  While I would generally prefer a stronger punch to it, it worked well to not overpower the sea bass.  In addition, my friend also slipped in an order of the skinny fries, and let me tell you - a \"basket\" of fries here really is a basket of fries.  The order was this huge mound of fried potato goodness, and even after chipping away at it throughout our meal, there was still plenty left for our other friend to snack on when he joined us.  Oh, and I can't forget to mention their bread basket either - all served hot and soft with salted butter.  All of the ones I tried were good, but my favorite was the toast-like bread with cheese...so good.  As for the rest of the experience, everything else was spot on.  Our server Sarah was awesome - really attentive, friendly, and pretty damn cute.  Now, I'm sure that last part MIGHT have had something to do with it, but seriously, really cute.  While it's kind of odd that it's located in a mall, I really liked the vibe of the place.  The main dining area is on a sort of a semi-open balcony (check out the pictures...quite a distinctive look), while they have a piano and singer by the bar.  While the music can make conversations a little tough, it's no worse than if you were sitting with a large group.   While I do somewhat regret not having ordered beef instead of fish, I have no complaints about what I had either (plus, was still under that damn zero/reduced beef pledge).  That said, I know I'll be back to try more of their menu anyways (saw several tables with the seafood tower), as well as to get a table in their \"tree house\" section.  Great ambiance for a date as well, and while not a cheap meal, it's certainly worth the price.  But then, that could just be my waitress-induced bias doing the talking too..",

    "text": "I think I am in the twilight zone after reading the other reviews.  just dropped 4 bills here on my silver anneversay dinner for 4 - no wine either.   Service and atmosphere were great.  however this did not make up for the food.  I would give it 2.5 stars.  appetizers we had were calimari and Boston clam chowder.  the sauce that came with the calimari was not good.  The calamari was above average.  the soup seemed to lack a good seafood stock so flavor was absent although it had a good amont of clams.  we ordered two sides with dinner.   lobster mash potatoes was a good size serving but the lobster chunks were swimming in a puddle of butter.  could get the texture of th lobster meat but not too much on the flavor side.  string been were better bu similar.   I had the artic char.  seemed to lack flavor likely more than a day old.  sauce was tasty but I love the flavors of really fresh fish.  My wife had Chilean sea bass.   I had a bite at the end.  it was fishy like an old fish.   I have this dish often and this was the worst I have had.  I couldn't eat desert after this.   My kids had a new York steak and rack of lamb.  both were not cooked well and we're tough.  I am pretty sure I could have kicked as on the chef for these dishes.   the rack of lamb did have a good serving portion.  I was hoping I could be more positive and considered that my palate could be off because of something I ate earlier.  however the Chilean sea bass had some good flavors but was overpowered by bad fishy flavors.",

    "text": "Mastro's Ocean Club located in Crystals at CityCenter is absolutely the best place restaurant with the best service on the latest Vegas business trip. In fact, I was more impressed with the non-swanky mall location than its Orange County siblings.  The Mall is incredibly quiet and the piano acoustics are phenomenal, making dinner at the bar or at a quiet table a very nice experience. Victor is a great bartender and the service is wonderful. As with all Mastro's, the wine list is incredible and goes on and on. Tonight was a Darioush Cabernet starter night as I pondered this wonderful menu, trying to stay light and healthy, amongst some decadent alternatives.   Eventually, I decided on a starter of Jalapeno Tuna Sashimi which is ahi tuna sliced sashimi style, topped with fresh squeezed key lime juice, thinly sliced jalapenos, and ponzu chili sauce. This is light despite looking like a lot of chili sauce.   Next, a salad of beefsteak tomato and onion with balsamic was a refreshing without being super oldtime steakhouse heavy!   For an entree, I ordered another small plate: The lobster cocktail which is 1.25 pounds (including shells). Now after eating all of this, I have slowed down and am just enjoying my wine when a couple of friends show up and we decide to end the evening with the crab claws which are excellent.  What an incredible meal, great services, great music and very relaxing.",

The first time was great had the Herb Roasted Chicken*24oz, Lobster Bisque Soup & Heirloom Tomato & Burrata, Creamed Spinach, Creamed Corn, Grilled Asparagus but the best part was the dessert that Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake is by far the best dessert you will every taste.    So on our second visit we wanted to see if they could repeat it.  Again we got the Herb Roasted Chicken*24oz - it really is very good and enough for two to share.  We got the Blue Cheese wedge and the  for the sides this time we stuck to the same creamed spinach, creamed corn but added the onion rings )which are fantastic) and the grilled Brussels Sprouts(i have to admit these were not bitter at all.)  then came the end that Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake was even better then I remembered its so gooey it melts in your mouth, you have to have it warm because we have stopped by just got the cake to go and it was server cold s not the same.    I recommend to anyone weather you live in Vegas or visiting try this place you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Decided to have a nice dinner with my husband and everyone recommended to come here.  We were both really excited and wanted to a enjoy a nice dinner even knowing that it would be pricey.  The server was very nice and a great salesman.  He knew exactly to recommend the most expensive items on the menu.  The bread basket is amazing!!! I think the drinks are WAY too expensive especially with the Vodka that they offer, $18 for a martini with SKY vodka is ridiculous!  Ordered: 18 oz Bone in Filet Mignon - Medium Lobster mashed potatoes Mushrooms and Truffle Fries Note - side orders are really big and are family style.  Results: Our steak even with the bone did not look 18 oz (not even close) our steak came rare, we sent parts of it back to cook just for a couple of more seconds and got it back totally well done and gross.  The Lobster mashed potatoes were ok and NOT worth $39 as you barely tasted the lobster and all you tasted were massive amounts of butter.  I would have been happy with garlic mash.  The mushrooms were amazing and probably the tastiest item we ordered.  The really expensive fries were soggy and didn't have much flavor at all.  The manager was nice enough to not charge us for the overly cooked steak but it was quite disappointing to go to specialty restaurant where they don't know how to cook their meat the right way.   Even after they took off the meat the bill came out to $140 and it was totally not worth it.  Very disappointed in our experience here.",

    "text": "I wanted to try Mastro's for two reasons: (1) If possible, I would gorge myself to death on seafood; and (2) I wanted to eat in the weird looking treehouse in Crystals.  I got both (except for death...unless....).  The ambiance of this place is weird, to say the least.  A few tables are enclosed in a traditional restaurant space with, you know, walls.  The rest are inside the \"treehouse,\" a very cool, wood-slated structure dangling in the middle of Crystals.  Although very cool looking, it's VERY LOUD.  In between the awwfffulll live music (really, they need to stop that) and the echo of everyone's conversations (no walls = no muffling of noise), it's almost difficult to have a conversation.  I would say this is not a romantic spot to eat.    There were also lots of middle-aged dudes in jeans.  Like, packs of them.  Very weird.  FOOD  As we were in a \"small plate\" mood, we went crazy on the appetizers as follows:  Sauteed Sea Scallops ($22)- Three medium-sized scallops, three slices of parmesan toast, diced tomatoes and cream sauce.  Unfortunately, the scallops were a tad overcooked and chewy. I'd probably pass on scallops next time.  Beef Bone Marrow (around $18) - two huge bones and baguette toast.   Delicious, decadent and full of flavor.  We gobbled it all up.  Seared Ahi Tuna encrusted in sesame seeds and served with julienned carrots ($22).  Overall, it lacked flavor although perfectly cooked.   Wedge salad - ($12) Big portion and very good.  I liked that they didn't cover the iceberg in dressing and instead left it on the bottom of the plate, surrounding the salad.  This allowed the diner to control how much dressing on each bite.  The dressing was a tad watery, the way I like it. Well executed.  But, it's a salad, so......  Then we got a half and half side of the following (they give you a half portion of each to let you try everything ($38):  King Crab Black Truffle Gnocci - Salty, rich and so delicious.  Lots of king crab chunks. My favorite thing I tried.  Lobster Cheese Mashed Potatoes -Although rich, it wasn't that flavorful. Mostly salty, not complex. I did love the enormous pieces of lobster, though.   I have to add they were really generous with the wine pour ($12 for a glass of Shiraz).  Overall, good service and big portions.  It's a bit pricey but they serve up some tasty food.    Definitely come here if you're 40 and have a penchant for denim.  This is your mecca.",

I was extremely disappointed with the dinner service and attention; it was extremely slow and absolutely no comparison to the fabulous, high energy and attentive service we received in NYC. Our server did not cover any specials or explain the different steak and cut options. He was more concerned with putting away the menus than attending to us. Our drinks at the bar were great plus plentiful and the bartender was attentive and fabulous. Our meal was good, however we really came for the experience and the service. This location does not compare in service to NYC. The location is nice and open in the Crystals Mall but we expected much more. We spoke to the Manager after and he was concerned and said he would address it. We were so disappointed that we skipped the butter cake and high tailed it out of there.

We also had the shrimp cocktail which was coincidentally one of the best shrimp cocktails I've ever had too.  The dry ice makes it that much more fun.  I think Mastro's has one of the best bread baskets in town as well, particularly the pretzel bread.  It makes it so you almost don't even need sides -- however, if you are getting sides, you must try the lobster mashed potatoes at least once in your life!  Thanks Mastro's for a fantastic evening!",

    "text": "Had a 4.5 star meal, but not quite 5 star, at Mastro's on a Friday night.  It was very crowded, as in full, but we were seated promptly at our reservation time of 8:00.  We were seated in a high top kind of half-booth type table.  I'd not sat in something like this before, but it was comfortable.  The place was humming, but since it's open to the mall, it wasn't so loud that you couldn't carry on a conversation.    Our server immediately approached us to take our water and drink orders.  She also provided a wine list, which was above average but pricey, which was expected given that Mastro's is located in Crystals on the Strip.  I didn't think it was out of line with other lists at similar places on the Strip.    To start, I went with the lobster bisque.  This was one of the best versions of this dish I've had.  It was velveety smooth with a lot of chunks of lobster.  The sherry came through, and it was seasoned very well.  Just a creamy lobstery soup.  You may get some sticker shock given that it's soup, but I think it was worth it (I can't recall the exact price, I believe it was either $16 or $18).  Additionally, a friend and I shared the ahi tuna tostada.  These come 3 to an order, but I could have easily eaten another dozen.  The tuna serving is substantial, and all of the accompaniments (avocado, onion salsa, and chili sauce) are fantastic.  Crispy, flavorful, but not too heavy.  Loved it.  We split steaks among the table, opting for the traditional bone in ribeye and the wagyu bone in ribeye from Australia.  It was $110, but well worth it.  It was noticeably better than the other steak.  Not that the \"regular\" ribeye wasn't good.  It was.  But, the depth of flavor with the wagyu was significantly better.  Absolutely re-order if they have it available.  Plus, since we were sharing they offered to cut it for us in the back of the house, which we appreciated.  On the side, we had the peppercorn steak sauce.  It's good, but I don't know that it's worthy of its reputation.  I didn't think the steaks needed it, so I only had a couple of bites with it.  The lobster mashed potatoes are incredibly decadent, nearly swimming in lobster and butter.  The twice baked potato is good, but it's typical for this type of dish.  For dessert, we went with the famous butter cake.  It easily lives up to its reputation.  Warm, a little crispy on the outside, but impossibly moist and buttery.  Served with berries, ice cream, and plenty of whipped cream, it was an excellent end to a great meal.    Service was fantastic the entire time.  Our server was there when we needed her but not overbearing.  Our food came out quickly, but we never felt rushed, despite knowing how busy they were that evening.  All in all, a great experience.  I can see why Mastro's has its reputation, I would absolutely return.",

I assumed it's just the plate.  The minute I put a piece of steak in my mouth OMG it's like heaven!  This is the way all steak should come out \"HOT\" like it was cooked and immediately bought out to your table.  I also have two seafood plates too.  It was also hot too! Most restaurant do not know how to get that part right. When you have multiple orders, and how to cook it where all the plates are delivered Hot.  The drinks are amazing.  The service is absolutely the best!  My must go place in Vegas from now on.  Just hope it will be consistent.  You got my Michelin 5 Star.",

Marc ended our special celebratory evening with a slice of chocolate cake (which is my bf's favorite!) and a birthday candle. Everything about the restaurant is top notch!! Look forward to going back on our next visit to Vegas. Thanks again to the entire staff that made the night so special. :)",

We were here for a work dinner and wanted to splurge on some great food for the price... only our main course was way delayed from our appetizers and once our steaks were received they were not cooked to order and had to be sent back. After waiting for order to come back the steak was again not cooked correctly and wasn't worth the effort to say anything at this point nor did we have much of an appetite sitting and waiting over 3 hours from start to finish. Therefore I will be hesitant to visit again.     Again our server Mike was fantastic.",

We went ahead and ordered the bone in rib eye steak that was done on medium well. Tender to perfection, greatly seasoned. I didn't want the steak to end so I was taking my time eating it. The rosemary garlic mushrooms were really tasty and nutritious. The rosemary and mushrooms created a lovley aroma and cream of corn was nutritious and creamy delightful every bite was worth it. Oh but the desserts were chocolatey and sweet to perfection. My taste buds were extremely happy and satisfied. I'll definitely be back to try more great entrees!",

Mastro's is located inside the Shops at Crystals on the second floor. My boyfriend loved his Hennessy sidecar cocktail and always talks about going back just for drinks and to try their dessert.  We decided to skip appetizers and just go straight into the main course. We got the 22 ounce bone-in ribeye, the ahi tuna sashimi, lobster mashed potatoes, and sauteed broccoli. Since we were sharing, they offered to plate and serve everything for us. We ordered with the intention that the tuna would be for me, and the steak would be for him but by the end of the meal, I enjoyed the steak so much I ended up eating most of it. I'm a fan of ribeye steaks because i find them to be more flavorful than filets - and the steak here had a nice sear on the outside and perfectly tendor on the inside. The lobster mashed potatoes were yummy but a little bit salty to me (although my boyfriend said it was fine and he loved it). The amount that we ordered was more than enough for two people, we didn't get to dessert because we were so stuffed.",

I even saw the manager inspecting a table set up with a FLASHLIGHT to make sure there were no spots on the silverware or glasses, and no crumbs left under the table! Wow!  They even bring you your food on a very heated plate. All the food was super hot! I LOVE that as one of my pet peeves in most restaurants is the food isn't hot enough.   You could make a meal on the bread basket alone. We had a Caesar salad to start, and then we split the 16 ounce New York strip steak, Scalloped potatoes, and sauteed shrimp. Also order a bottle of wine. Everything was PERFECT with the food, timing of dinner, & service.  DO NOT miss the ButterCake! It is heavenly and they serve it with a HUGE plate of whipped cream.   It was our first visit to Mastro's but it won't be our last! I have a feeling this place is going to become our go to for special occasions! Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Mastro's Ocean Club is a fine dining experience that must be seen to be believed - so long as you're willing to pay the price that accompanies that experience or know someone who will.  Mastro's steals the show at The Shops at Crystals (or chews the scenery, depending on your point of view) with its distinctive \"pod\" hanging over a major walkway. You'll either find it breathtaking or tacky - I tend towards the former - but either way, it doesn't come cheap.  Their food makes just as much of an impression as the \"pod\" their restaurant lives inside, with a seafood selection so exhaustive and delicious you almost forget you're eating at a nautical restaurant with \"Ocean Club\" in its name in the heart of the desert. Their lobster tail is quite delicious, and I say this as someone who doesn't consider lobster one of their favorite foods.  In total, Mastro's Ocean Club makes for a lovely night out. It's certainly a place to impress your date or, more likely, colleagues when the expense account is in your hands. Your taste buds will thank you and the top-notch service will make you feel like an old friend who's in on all the jokes. I just don't know if it's enough to justify the price tag in a saturated restaurant market replete with competing options.",

However, my second visit was terrible; even with them knowing I'm a resident at the adjacent high rise. My food was not even processed into an order, until I came inside and paid. The first time I came, my food was out in 5 mins; I always place a pick I'm order. The shrimp was greasy, the lemon and garnishes were thrown about and halfway properly set. The ice cream was put in some cheap styrofoam cup, versus the tub it typically comes in. The first time I went, I was greeted at the entrance and as soon as I got to the bar. This last time, nobody greeted me; I had to tell them I needed to pick up an order and actually flag down the girl standing directly in front of me drying cups. My first order I got my complimentary bread basket, this order; NONE. I was then given an attitude when I asked about it, and explained my first experience. I even went as far as to show them photos of my first time there, and the manager couldn't say anything. He immediately canceled the order.",

It's is NOT hard to drop $200/person on dinner with even a lower tier bottle of wine.   We got the seafood tower to start with a side dish of oysters. The tower was all on ice and had 3 of each item (3 People). You are able to build your own tower, which can be good and bad (gets expensive and all the items sound good). The Ribeye was cooked to perfection - I would also recommend a side of bearnaise sauce to taste.   Topped off with a side of grilled Brussel Sprouts and a $70 bottle of wine, this meal was PERFECT.

    "text": "This was a first time experience at this establishment. I'm always excited for a great dining experience. After looking on line and reading the menu I was hoping for great things to come. We had a large party so plans were set up in advance for a private room. As we arrived we were led to one of the private dining rooms, they appeared a little too small for my comfort or maybe it was the fact they place multiple round tables in a triangle shaped room. Made it very hard to Socialize. They have a very impressive wine list to which I ordered wine by the glass 26.00 to be exact but not everyone was interested in drinking wine or the type I desired. The crab cakes were very good they were served on platters and also served with a Caesar Salad which was passed. Being we had a larger party with us gave us a chance to try many of the food at one sitting. I shared a 22oz Rib eye and an order of twin lobster tails. I ordered the stake Charred rare. I do enjoy my meat in a very rare manor however this stake was beyond rare there was no charring and the stake appeared to be like maybe being applied to heat for 2 minutes per side then done. The Twin tails were actually a disappointment as well.  One tail was not even cooked the other was fine. I had my partner take the good tail as they took away the raw tail to recook. I did get a taste of the Lemon sole and will say it was very good. On out table we had Lobster mashed potatoes, very good Gorgonzola mac and cheese, (mac and cheese) Sweet potatoes fries which were good and Brussels sprouts which were tasty. About the time I ordered another glass of wine and ate about 3 bites of my extra rare steak, I was done as I had tasted many of the sides several pieces of bread my lobster tail arrived. When he brought it to the table I advised just box it up. A little disappointing. Now as everyone is sitting around full and content was time for desert. Coffee was being served and we ordered the following deserts Warm butter cake which does live up to its name, and the cherry crisp & cheese cake. Deserts all were very well prepared.  It was a nice experience but I was a little set back on the main course. I also wish the room we were in was better set up as I was sitting with my back towards many of our guests. One last thing about the main course even though it was virtually raw when it arrived at my table the flavor of the meat was very good.",

    "text": "We had a very negative experience with their banquet staff for a group event we held here about a year ago. We had a group of about 50 people in a private room with wine and everything, so we spent a significant sum (I think it was around $5,000).   Later in the evening, after the dessert course, we had asked the waitstaff to come speak to us to inform us as to the status of the bill and if we were under the minimum spend required or over it. No one came to inform us later in the evening as to the status of the minimum. In fact, the waiters were nowhere to be found later in the evening. Then, to our surprise, a waiter came up with the check and presented it to us and we were under by a significant sum - about $1200. We told him that if he had come to us earlier, then we would have ordered more food or wine.   The banquet contact person had left for the evening so the waiter suggested that they would just add onto our bill about 40 bottles of wine as a \"placeholder\" and that we could resolve it later. We emailed the banquet person the next morning but never heard back and we had to leave Las Vegas for our flight home.   Later, we talked to our contact person with banquets and they insisted that we come pick up the wine. We said we weren't local so we couldn't come. And the restaurant wouldn't ship it to us because of wine regulations for shipping wine out of state. We asked for a credit or gift cards but they refused, even though it was their staff who suggested putting the wine bottles on the bill.   Finally, a few weeks later they said they no longer had the wine (we don't know what happened to it; but I'm sure they just re-sold it at a profit in their dining room) so we couldn't have it. But they refused to give us credit for the wine that THEY profited from.   Now it has been a year and they are still holding our wine \"hostage,\" telling us that there's a corporate policy against storing wine so they were justified in getting rid of the wine. What corporate policy involves reselling wine at a profit and then refusing to pay the fair amount owed to those customers? We PAID $1200 for this wine and then they profited off of it - that's unjust enrichment.   I would not recommend doing a special event with their banquets facility.",

Located in the Crystals mall just outside the main entrance to Aria, sister restaurant to Scottsdale & Beverly hills' location. we embarked on night one in Vegas.  So let's start with the drinks at the Piano bar a very nice opening where a piano man and gorgeous singer belt out a few tunes prior to dinner where we were seated in the Tree house so to speak.  Bright open and airy we were treated service wise very nicely.  8 Tonight and waiters and staff were brisk and efficient.  The standard push for bottled water well you get the drill. A High end steak house and fish place that needs no preamble.  Great Start bread basket with Pretzel breads and such excellent!   I'll run it down.  Shrimp cocktail is a highlight with the dry ice making the fog come off the shrimp it's an eye catcher.  Asked for horseradish on the side oh boy the hottest dam thing I've ever consumed. one drop in the sauce made my dry stuffed nose wince and my head was cleared like a nitrate ammonia pack from my football days. Yea baby it was good! A lobster cocktail was also equally outstanding.  Multiple salads were also ordered and shared from a Chopped house salad, a Cesar salad and beefsteak tomatoes & Mozzerella.  Skip the last one.   Entrees: 7 Steaks one piece of fish. Every single steak was absolutely delicious From the bone in filet to the strip to the bone in KC Strip there were outstanding. One was cooked or shall I say undercooked and the handled it not only by fixing the dish but removing it from the bill.  The Hawaiian big eyed Tuna was horrible only way to describe it. Sorry but another get this out of here moments.   Sides: All very generous in size and easily splittable among the group 4 sides way too much for 8 people. Lobster Mashed potatoes a die for moment outstanding Sauteed mushrooms yummy Gorgonzola Mac & cheese another to die for moment  Creamed spinach excellent.  All and all a fine dining experience with the drawback of a couple of 1 undercooked steak and one bad entree both removed from Bill make this a nice experience.",

    "text": "I love this place!   My boyfriend and I came here to celebrate our 6 months semi-anniversary and we certainly had a great time! The only down side is it burnt a hole in our wallet. But it is a special occasion and we both think it is worth it.   I made a reservation on line at open table and I mentioned our occasion. When we were at the hostess stand, we were greeted by our last name which really surprised me. We waited for about 2 min before we got seated in the tree house, just like how I requested in my reservation. Our server came right away to take our drink orders and also gave us some recommendations.   We decided to go with the Surf and Turf they have which comes with a 3 pound Maine Lobster and steak of our choice. One thing about the meal here is that it does not come with any sides. You only get what you order. If you want to have mashed potatos or onion rings, you do have to order them seperately which again raises the cost.   The food came fairly fast after we ordered and the busser divided the meal for us right by the table. The lobster tasted great so did the steak! The server was telling us that they have a live fishtank in the back and all the lobsters they have came in daily directly from Maine! You can't get anything fresher than that in Vegas! The steak is flavorful and juicy. My boyfriend said it could be more tender. As for the side, we ordered Scalloped potatoes and Corossal Onion Rings. We both like the potatoes it was yummy but not too impressed by the Onion Rings, for some reason it tastes a bit soft.   Upon we were finishing up our meal, so stuffed at that point, our server actually surprised us with a complimentary desert for our celebration! What a nice gesture! So definitely put in the occasion if you are celebrating anything at Mastro's!   The environment is elegant and classy with live performance. It is expensive but you definitely get what you pay for. We return on our next special occasion.",

The manager, Brandon, remembered us immediately and wished my mom a happy birthday and offered us a free dessert. We were shocked that not only did he recognize us, but he also remembered it was my mom's birthday. A few minutes later another manager, Aaron, comes up and brings my mom a free martini! It was such a shock and wonderful experience. We also had a super great waitress, Katie. Truly amazing customer service, better than I have experienced in a long time. Would definitely recommend this place to anyone thinking of coming! The food was also amazing! Great steaks and sides (best French fries I have ever had) and the most amazing butter cake.

There's a nice variety of steaks and seafood, and the ambiance is quiet and fantastic. It's not too trendy or loud, and the food is classic and well prepared. The tree house area is especially nice.   We tried a bit of everything, and all of it was fantastic. The cold seafood tower appetizer was fantastic (the stone crab claws were the stand out!). For our entrees most of us got seafood and were all pleased! I loved my arctic char, although it was HUGE - stupid HUGE. Honestly it seemed like 16-20 ounces of freaking fish on my plate. With all the other yummy food floating around I could barely polish off a quarter of my fish. If I was dining with my husband, this is definitely a dish we could share. The best side with the crab and black truffle gnocchi... OMG.. best gnocchi of my life ! The lobster mashed potatoes were pretty incredible as well.   So the butter cake did live up to the hype! Moist, rich, delicious. Four of us split this and felt like there was more than enough to go around. Even if you don't think you have room for dessert - this cake is good enough to warrant making yourself sick !  I can't say I tried any meat, but for seafood I really loved this place. Great service, and great food.",

It was pricey but you get the mixer and the extra contents, which is pretty much 2 cocktails for the price of one. The food was nothing short of spectacular. I ordered the ribeye and it was cooked perfectly, seasoned well and simply amazing. Their sea bass is so tender and melts in your mouth like butter! Ah! Yum! ** The really nice thing about the place is their hefty portions, so at least you leave full and like you got your monies worth.  It a MUST to try the Warm Butter Cake Dessert! It's worth the $16 to spend, it's a warm yellow buttery cake that's crispy on the outside, with sugar coating and warm and gooey on the inside. There's a large scoop of vanilla ice cream on top and the whole thing is finished with raspberry drizzle. It also comes with a large side of house whipped cream!   The first time I dined at the restaurant, I received stellar service; this second time around I saw my server 3 times during our meal and I wasn't impressed with his serving qualities.   All in all, it is definitely an experience to dine at mastros. The food speaks for itself.",

So we walked over to the next building and finally decided on Mastro's since I loved the one in Beverly Hills.    It didn't disappoint..the service was A+..our waitress kept a close eye on us to refill any drinks and was very knowledgable about the menu.  The Maine lobster was exquisite and the asparagus crisp and seasoned.  My poor friend ordered sushi which she didn't like because there was chocolate in the sauce.  Chocolate?!?  The lemon drop martini was awesome.  It came to the table smoking and kept on smoking for awhile. . We shared a delicious dessert.  $250 dinner for two..well worth it.

All of it was the bomb .com.     For the main course we shared the sides of corn in creme, mashed potatoes w/ lobster, and the best mac in cheese this world has ever seen. My oldest son got the bone in fillet, the best dish of the night.. (yes I said dish). I got the scallops as well as my middle one, perfectly cooked,and the sauce was heaven with the bread. My husband got the New York strip, which was cooked perfectly and very delicious!!!! My little one had a little of each of our plates ;).

    "text": "If I could give this place 100 stars I would.    Found this steakhouse on Yelp and 4  1/2 stars rarely disappoints so I made reservations via Open Table.  I found a few websites suggesting other steakhouses but I found them all to be owned by famous people and didn't want to dine at place based on being known by their owners.  I'm so glad I went with Mastro's.  So first off, yes, it is in a mall but I had no issues with that.  We sat in the 'treehouse' which faced all the high-end stores but never did I think it was awkward.  I mean....high-end steakhouse in a high-end mall, surrounded by high-end retail stores.  Nothing wrong with that.  What really counts is the FOOD and ambiance.  For a little less than $200, my husband and I each ordered an appetizer, salad, drink, an entree, and shared a side dish.  We had a late lunch so didn't order many sides.  We got the Brussel sprouts which were more than enough for two people.  A third would've been ok too.  The steak was DELSIH!  I have to say prob the best steak I've EVER had and I've had some of the best.  The steak literally MELTS in your mouth and before I even moved my knife to cut it, the tip of the knife t split the top of the steak open, that's how tender their steak is.  At first I was like whoa, $17 for a drink?  Well, you get them for free at the casino for a reason....it's prob watered down and not the best quality alcohol.  $17 actually gets you what appears to be more like two drinks as they leave the shaker on your table and that serves another glass.  By the way, the drinks were all delish as well.  The other highlight of the night, as if it wasn't the food itself wasn't enough, was the staff.  Our waiter Daniel Ellery was awesome.  Not only was he super nice and very courteous, but he was very knowledgeable about the menu.  My pet peeve is when you ask about certain dishes and how they are prepared and the waiter say, \"Oh, I don't know.  Let me get back to you.\"  Anyhow, I really enjoyed our dinner and the ambiance.  Everything was perfect for my birthday weekend, which by the way, they brought out a very lovely chocolate cake.  I'm not usually a sweets person but this cake was sooooo good.  Not too sweet and creamy.  It was delish!  Will definitely be back in the future.",

DISCLAIMER: They do tend to undercook their steaks but they did take it back and fix my New York strip. And of course we had to try the seafood tower. I love that you can build it yourself! Our waiter was so pleasant and attentive. Seriously he just made the night. Wish I could remember his name but all I remember was thay he was Canadian lol Only because I am a die hard Michael Buble fan lol",

She was very attentive and literally went the extra mile to make sure we had everything we needed or if we wanted anything else.  The steaks are by far always the best!  The setting in the Mall there I found to be quite loud and not the typical high end feeling you get at their other places.  What drew us there was the food and they definitely were spot on there!  5 stars for the food.",

Unfortunately for us, many of the restaurants that served seafood were primarily steakhouses.  We read a few yelp reviews for Mastro's among others and eventually made a reservation here for dinner that same night.  When we arrived, we were seated inside the \"tree house\" that's suspended in the center of the shops.  We ordered a bottle of Shiraz, the halibut and the sea bass encrusted with their special seasoning, and macaroni and cheese.  Our water was never more than half empty at any given time throughout our entire meal.    The food and wine turned out to be amazing!  Our waiter (I wish I remembered his name) was kind enough to ask if we wanted the rest, including the wine, boxed up since I had been feeling sick to finish it.    A few tips if you visit, the sides are quite large, probably enough to split with up to 4 people.  Trust your waiter/waitress.  Ours suggested the preparation we had on our fish and we were not disappointed.  And the price is a bit high but well worth it in the end.  I would definitely go back here again.",

The Treehouse is their main dining area which is shaped like a Treehouse that overlooks the center of the Crystals' Mall.  For starters, we ordered their stone crabs abd lobser bisque.....both were very average.   The bisque was watery....not very thick and rich.  For our entrees, we had the sea bass and rack of lamb....both very flavorful and super tasty.  For sides, we had their creamed corn and lobster truffled gnocci....both were extremely, extremely rich (too much cream and truffled cheese).....but very flavorful.  For desert, we had their famous butter pound cake with ice cream and chocolate starwberrries......the cake was very average......I can get more flavorful pound cake at Safeway...the chocolate strawberries were good, but nothing spectacular.  The service was average at best.   Overall, the food was good, not great. One extra star for the cool treehouse dining experience.",

Well we were more than happy with her choice. Our waiter Troy was great. He made us feel welcome and assured us that there was no rush. He decanted a special bottle of wine that we brought with us from the Aventura Winery in Paso Robles. This is a \"big\" red wine so we both chose the filet mignon with baked potato and sauteed brussel sprouts. The filet was best I have had in many years anywhere-hands down. Cooked to perfection and melted in mouth.  At the end of the meal Troy brought out their signature dessert, a warm vanilla pound cake served with real whipped cream topped with a candle. This is not your grandma's pound cake. It was just decadent and there was more than enough to share. I rarely give 5 Star reviews to any restaurant but this was a 5 Star experience in every sense. If you are in Vegas don't hesitate to book a table here you won't be disappointed.   PS the ambience was enhanced by a excellent piano player who had just the right mix of songs to accompany a leisurely dinner.",

    "text": "Since I had a good experience at the Mastro's Steakhouse in OC, I decided to try this Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas and let me tell you, I had an even better experience.  It's probably due to the fact that I LOVE SEAFOOD!!!  I was tempted to get an appetizer tower but there were other things on the  menu that I wanted to try that were actually served hot so we opted out of the tower.  Instead we ordered the following:  *Seared Ahi Tuna - (just as good as the first time I had it in OC) *Sauteed Sea Scallops - 3 pieces of jumbo scallops with three pieces of bread, in a rich creamy sauce.  AMAZING!!!  I just found out I'm moderately allergic to scallops but I love jumbo scallops so it doesn't stop me from trying them anyways. SOO YUMMY. * Chilled Alaskan King Crab Claws - came out served is a cool bowl with dry ice.  Loved it.  Way A lot more tasty than shrimp cocktail or lobster option.    This was definitely more than filling but it didn't stop me from ordering a Chilean Sea Bass for my entree since my favorite fish are chilean sea bass or cod anything.  I'm use to ordering these type of fishes miso style but since it wasn't an option, I decided to order it pan seared.  It came out nice fluffy and buttery.  I ordered it cooked medium.  I really liked the consistency of the fish and how it was cooked but wouldn't have minded some type of sauce to give that extra umph.  To be honest, I couldn't enjoy it as much because I was so stuffed!  I really wanted to try the infamous warm butter cake but I guess I'm just going to have to wait it out until the next time.  I will definitely come back :)",

Luckily, the delicious food and wine made up for the sour date.  We started with the oysters (Blue Points I think). They were fresh and delicious. We then shared the seared scallops and bone-in fillet mignon as our main dishes. The scallops were cooked perfectly. They were a bit creamy for my taste but overall a solid dish. The bone-in fillet mignon, omg, was soooo good, probably the best steak I've had in the US. The meat was tender yet full of flavor. I was in heaven and couldn't care much less about whatever Mr. Snobby was barking about.   Oh and we shared crab gnocchi as the side dish (with a price tag of $30, a bit steep for a side dish.) I also had a glass of Pinot Noir (ZD '09) to go with the steak - the wine didn't have enough body, but it went very well with the meat.   I knocked off one star because they served the scallops and the steak at the same time in the same plate, which I really didn't like. I would prefer having them separately. The scallops should have come first and then the steak as two individual courses. This way I could have really taken my time to taste each dish.   Overall, I really liked this restaurant. As for my date, I found out he wasn't all that annoying anyways. He was kinda cute and was quite thoughtful when I wasn't feeling well at the end of the meal. I may come back to the Mastro's next time I am in Vegas. Will I go out with Mr. Snobby again? I think so.",

    "text": "Perfect first experience at Mastro's! Went there to celebrate our anniversary and they really did make it feel like a special occasion. We were seated in the treehouse - beautiful and romantic, great date spot.  Really unique cocktail list -definitely not the usual boring drinks. I tried the blueberry martini, didn't really care for the taste since I prefer sweet drinks, but it was strong and something different. Cocktails were a little pricey at about $18 each, but you pay for the ambiance.  Started w escargot, I've never had it served in the shell before. Very pretty and delish - served w clarified butter and garlic. Great selection of yummy breads too.  We shared the 18oz bone in Kansas city strip w twin lobster tails (1 butter poached, 1 vanilla tempura fried). Sides - twice baked potato and brussel sprouts w bacon. Steak was cooked perfectly medium, tender, juicy and flavorful. They knew we were sharing so everything was split for us. Poached lobster was good, cooked perfectly. The tempura lobster... mmm I'm not a huge fan. It was good, but a LOT of batter and I didn't really get even a hint of vanilla. Glad we decided to try it both ways.  Twice baked potato was good, but I've had better. They didn't bring it out till about 10min after the rest of the food because the chef didn't like how the first one looked, so he made a new one. They took it off the bill w out us asking. Nice that the chef has attn to detail vs just cranking out the orders. Brussel sprouts used to be fried w pancetta but they recently changed the menu, so no more pancetta. They did accommodate by doing it w bacon instead, but not really the same - thin sliced bacon just can't compare to chunks of pancetta. We got the butter cake comp since it was an anniversary. Super cute of them to do a candle. The cake is enough for 3 or 4 to share, served w vanilla ice cream and a huge bowl of fresh whipped cream. So bad, but soooo good!  Service was excellent, our server Mike was friendly and knowledgeable. The rest of the wait staff were great too. I checked out our neighbors food, I'm looking forward to trying the seabass, seared tuna, or crab salad next time.  In the end there's not a huge difference w steak joints - they generally serve the same cuts, appetizers and sides. But Mastro's stands apart with its service and intimate classy ambiance.",

I'd strongly recommend getting seated there and not because of the view (The \"breathtaking\" scenery consists of every high-end luxury goods store on this planet. Then again, I know people who enjoy staring at $5000 handbags from a distance.). It's because the other half of the restaurant looked packed as hell. I wouldn't be surprised if the diners were eating their neighbors steaks by accident.   2. There's more fish on the menu - hence the name - although there was no noticeable difference shellfish selection-wise. Sadly, Billy Ocean wasn't singing at the piano. Mastro's, you screwed up on a golden opportunity here.  3. The bar's wall o' liquor is an impressive monument to chronic liver failure. Then again, this is a city where it's legal to walk down the street slurping Everclear out of a foot-long Eiffel Tower.   4. Steak's great. But not comparable to the Beverly Hills branch.",

    "text": "Completely disappointed by Maestro's restaurant in Las Vegas.  I read such wonderful reviews on yelp and was really looking forward to it. My husband and I went there for our 1 year wedding anniversary dinner. I made reservations a month before the big day and requested to have a bottle of champagne upon our arrival.    We ordered the beef Carpaccio to start.  It took about 20 minutes for them to take that initial order and another 20-30 minutes for them to bring it out.  The beef Carpaccio was SO salty and came with a weird Caesar salad combination on top as aside. The dressing of the salad ruined the flavor of the meat if the salt didn't already to it.   As our main entrees we ordered a petite filet and lamp chops. DRY, DRY, DRY! I'm sorry but if we are paying over +$50 a plate we expect mouth watering tender meat.  That wasn't the case at all. So disappointed.   To end the evening we were so disappointed by the slow service, the bad appetizer and unsatisfactory entree we didn't even want dessert. As the waiter brings the +$200 check he just says Happy Anniversary and walks away.  No complimentary dessert or glass of champagne as most places would have done. Oh well...I will go back to SAGE inside Aria which is the BEST steak house I have ever been too.",

The service was excellent, as was the wine, the bread provided, and the birthday cake they made for my boyfriend.  The look of the place is the coolest part, though, especially from the outside looking in.  It's located inside a mall, and words can't quite describe the architecture of the structure the restaurant is in, but it's neat and adds to the experience.",

We made reservations a few days before and got a phone call to confirm. It's located in Crystal Shops at City Center which is connected to Aria.  We were a bit early but were still seated as soon as we arrived. The restaurant from outside err inside the mall looks so cool and it's even nicer from inside. Very nice ambience which calls for a relaxing meal. Now for the food: The bread basket had only one bread i liked. Basic french bread...typical. Then we started with drinks. I knew I would be having wine as opposed to my typical cocktail while DH unusually ordered beer so we were living wild! I needed help with finding the right wine to pair with my meal and the waiter was very helpful.  After tasting two wines, i settled for the Remy Pannier Chenin Blanc which was excellent with my Alaskan King Crab Legs. DH had the Alaskan Amber which was great with his meat haaaaaa. For sides, we went with Asparagus and Scalloped Potatoes. Both sides complimented the filet and crab legs and the meal was very tasty AND filling. To finish, we had the Creme Brulee and ice cream which were decadent.  This was one of my favorite experiences in Vegas. To top it off, we received a call the next day thanking us for choosing them and asking how our experience was. I would love to stop by again our next visit to the Sin City!",

    "text": "The food and service was on point here at Mastro's.   I always heard great things about it and I am so glad I finally tried it.   To start, I had the steamed mussels. Although the mussels were small the sauce and cheeses croutons were incredible. I took advantage of all the various breads they had in the basket just to dip in the sauce and Indulge more.   For dinner I had the Hawaiian tuna served sashimi style. It was seared with Asian inspired flavors and didn't make you feel so heavy. I will say that it is a quite a portion and initially seeing it can be overwhelming.  They warn about the size of the side portions so please think it through or else you will have way too much. I had a table of 4 and we battled to eat everything cause it was yummy but man I came out of there a fatty wack. I LOVED the Cream corn and Alaskan Crab truffle gnocchi. Done deal with those two! I had the lobster mash and yes it had big chunks of lobsters and it was good but not as great as it's hype was. We also had sauteed broccoli and honestly it looked steamed. They serve you the sides which I thought was a great service.   They gave us their signature butter cake. Topped with ice cream and fresh fruit with a side of whipped cream. If you even last this long to have dessert then order it. Warning-the portion is again good for 3-4 person so think it through before you order.   I would highly recommended this place. It's ambiance is okay because it still does feel like you are still in the shopping area even though you can't see it too much. Great service and great food. You really can't go wrong.",

I'm assuming because it's much newer. But I love it. The other ones seemed to cramp the tables too close together. As far as the food...amazing.

I ordered the largest steak; a 22oz. ribeye. It may have been the best steak I have ever tried in my life. Even the fat parts disintegrated in my mouth. My girl had the filet mignon.

    "text": "I wanted this to knock my socks off, but it fell short.  Mostly due to the service, partly due to the strange atmosphere and the fact that they were 40 minutes late seating us when we had reservations and arrived early for them.  First, the bar.  There is a beautiful bar, great drink list, nice bartenders, piano and lounge singer... all setting up for a relaxing setting, right?  Nope, the lounge singer, with piano accompaniment, sang songs by Katy Perry and Rhianna, and songs like \"Call Me Maybe\".  WTF?  It was just so weird!   We had 8:30 reservations, arrived around 8:20, and didn't get a table around 9:10.  That's just bad planning on their part, I believe.  Now, the service was the worst part of our meal. The menu is very simple, with no explanations of any of the items.  You would rely on your server to elaborate on preparations, etc, when the menu contains none.  This was where the meal went off the tracks.  There was just a list of all the available entrees (lots of different fish, etc), and our server showed up and said, \"are you guys ready?\".  I said something like, \"we're unsure of the preparations available for each fish\"... and he said something like, \"oh, we can do blackened... you know... whatever......\".  SERIOUSLY?  That's it?  So guess what I ordered... Blackened halibut!  I didn't know how else to order!  Even the salads, the one we ordered was the spicy mambo salad, had no explanation.  What the hell is a spicy mambo salad?  I don't know, so thank god we liked it.  It was like a spicy caesar salad and was very good.  My halibut was delicious, my husband's tuna was great.  Portions are RIDICULOUSLY HUGE.  I wouldn't suggest 2 side dishes for 2 people, just choose one and share it.  We had so much food left over, it was depressing to leave it all to be thrown away, but it's Vegas!  We're not gonna pack leftovers around all night!  After we ordered, the server at the table next to us went through the available preparations with his table, and after hearing them, I would have definitely liked to try several of them.  I was very disappointed by our server.  All in all, the food is delicious, but good food is not hard to find in Vegas.  The service is a big part of making a great meal, and this was lackluster.  Not sure I would return or recommend this restaurant, with all the great options in this town.",

The Pro's:  * Staff is always top notch, from the hostess, to the bus guys, all are great and seem to have been trained very well. Anyone can help you with anything. Never do you hear \"I will tell your waiter\". They just get things done and do it well.  * Food I always top notch. Never had a better steak on the strip.   * Great vibe and crowd. Upscale and nice looking crowd. No torn jeans and camo here. It's nice seeing folks get cleaned up and dressed for dinner.  I will keep this review short as I have already reviewed them several times and don't want to repeat comments. If you have not tried this place, you should. Top notch for sure.",

When you spend a lot of money at a restaurant you expect great service and our waiter stood around talking and laughing with other waiters and barely paid any attention to us.  Our drinks were empty multiple times for long periods of time.  Took him forever to take our order and acted like he worked at a dinner instead of an upscale restaurant.  I'm sure if we had a different server I would feel better about spending hundreds of dollars on our meal but we got what we got and unfortunately I have to base my experience on that.",

The food is plentiful so don't even think of not sharing side dishes.  As for the desert, we took their specialty, which is the butter cake.  It's ENORMOUS and plenty for two, maybe for three.  And it comes with a huge bowl of delicious whip cream. The wine list was a nice surprise too and we ordered a Pinot Noir Chateau St Jean.  Very nice and under $30. The atmosphere is another good surprise.  Feels much nicer being in the \"nest\" than seeing it from the outside. The choices in Las Vegas are plenty, but this one is definitely a win.",

Our waiter was fantastic. Best overall service in a restaurant we've had in a long time.  B)  Atmosphere:  OK. We sat \"outside\" so that we had a view of the mall. The atmosphere here is really not conducive to a great experience. You feel like you are eating in a mall food court. They should really try to find a better location with better ambiance.   C) Food. Really good ( almost) There were 4 of us and we all ordered some variation of a fillet. Mine came out perfect, but my wife ordered hers medium rare and it came out close to well done. We were having such a good time with our friends that she didn't want to spoil the scene and return the steak. Otherwise everything was great including the shaker that they bring to your table with your cocktail, so that you actually can 2 glasses of booze for $18 rather than one.   Overall, another great steakhouse in Vegas. Probably won't come back. Not because it was poor, but just because there are so many other places to explore in this restaurant town.",

The gorgonzola mac n cheese is out of this world. The brussel sprouts are excellent. The scallops amazing. The oysters rockefeller were the best I've ever tasted. The Chilean Sea bass also was the best I've ever tasted (my bf had that... I tasted it). Then the warm butter cake... Cuh-ray-zee!!! So unbelievably good.

Plus, the restaurant is in a treehouse, which makes for such a fun but elegant setting. Decor & service on point. They're making me a fort for my next visit - a promise is a promise.  Yup.

I've been many times and when I leave there I feel as happy as can be... then a few days later I feel the low of the expense. Then I do it all over again and the cycle continues. My favorite is the seared scallops. What I like to do to cut the cost is order a seafood tower, maybe split a truffle gnocchi side and a veggie then order the seared scallops appetizer for entree. Trust me it's plenty of food. You'll get 3 scallops instead of 5 but pay a fraction of the cost.",

Make a reservation and ask for a table overlooking the balcony of the bird's nest.    We tried a little bit of everything.  To begin, the bread is fantastic.  baguette and pretzel rolls were the standouts, but I love a restaurant the begins with an assortment of complimentary.  The tuna tartare was heavy on the avocado, but surprisingly each bite mixed well with the tuna.  The mambo caesar salad was one of the best salads I've had with a kick of wasabi flavoring in the dressing to clear the sinuses.  For entrees, the table had the sea bass, tartare, lobster, steak, and big eye tuna.  We also shared sauteed spinach and the crab gnocchi.  Everything had a unique spice or rub that made sharing ideal.  The lobster was some of the thickest and freshest I've had.  The tuna was very good and had an Asian flare of black sesame seed rub, but this dish is also presented as an appetizer if you want a half portion.  The sea bass was fantastic fish but a little bland in all.  Steak - just a well-prepared steak nothing more nothing less.  The spinach was fine as a green but the gnocchi, with chunks of crab, was a nice accompaniment to the fish as its creaminess was a nice dipping alternative to change the flavor palette of the meal.  Finally, the butter cake.  Top 3 dessert of all time.  Don't know how they make it and don't wanna know.  I just want to enjoy it again and again . Fantastic.  All items come a la carte so be sure to feast on the sides.  Also inquire about half orders as this restaurant is surprisingly accommodating to changes to how the fish is cooked, changes to ingredients in orders, or sizing.  Mastro's is one of the best.",

    "text": "We really enjoy dropping in to Mastro's Ocean Club for a drink or a nice meal at the bar. Charelle is great. She will take care of you guys for sure. Mastro's is located inside Crystals mall in the City Center. We were there on a Sunday night and just had the most pleasant time.   We had just an appetizer with our drinks. We got the calamari. It was good. It was all calamari rings in a seasoned breading. Delicious... You can never go wrong with calamari and theirs is one of the better ones. We also had the famous signature warm butter cake. DAMN... That really is a delicious dessert. It is like the most perfect butter pound cake topped with a tasty vanilla ice cream, surrounded with strawberry & baby orange slices and drizzled with strawberry sauce. It's so good. It's so rich but worth it if you share it. The bottom of the butter cake has a caramelized crust so when you get to that bite, you're in for a flavor kick. So good. You have to get it... I'm glad we finally tried it.   Service at the bar was exceptional. Charelle, the bartender, made a perfect dirty ketel martini and was such a pleasant person to conversate with. Mastro's is lucky to have her. We enjoyed our time at the bar with her and appreciated her suggestions & customer service. Make sure you look for her. Thank you Mastro's Ocean Club and Charelle! We'll  be back soon... In a few weeks, in fact!",

The accompanying dishes, wine pairings and cocktails were really what dining at Mastros to a higher level of excellence.   The buttery lobster mashed potato was divinity on a plate.  Smooth, rich and very generously apportioned with large portions of lobster.  The shrimp cocktail was adorned with plump and juicy prawns (what we call them in Oz) and the accompanying horseradish really packs a strong punch.   The only time I eat bread and butter is while dining at restaurants.  I certainly wasn't disappointed by the carefully arranged basket of bread and the purest of butter goodness at Mastros.  A rum based cocktail marked the start of our eating festivities and a good South Australian Shiraz ensured the gleeful fine dining momentum continued throughout.",

But yes, that is butter.\"  I like how he didn't give me a straight answer first. It sure looked like some sauce!  Bread basket- LOVE.  Seafood appetizer- much more filling than expected.

    "text": "Whoa... Don't waste your time or money. There are far too many fantastic choices in Vegas to come here. Shockingly horrible food experience we had for our pre Christmas dinner last Sunday. I do NOT recommend coming here. I can't believe we paid $270 for a mediocre meal... what a disappointment. Fail Mastro's Vegas! Again, I highly, suggest spending your money somewhere else. The one star that I gave them was for, Dalan, our awesome server.   Now, I have been to Mastro's in OC about a dozen times and it has never failed me but in Las Vegas it was a major let down. What happened?! If anything, I expected more out of the Las Vegas location. We ordered:  1. Shrimp cocktail 2. Wagu 8oz. Steak $98 3. Gorgonzola mac and cheese 4. Creamed spinach 4. Creamed corn  5. Key lime pie  The shrimp cocktail was the best thing my boyfriend had, served with their house cocktail sauce. The Wagu steak was cooked medium but was the texture of a pork chop. Unlike the buttery, melt-in-your-mouth goodness they boast of. The Mastro's in OC  Wagu steak was cooked to perfection so I have something to compare it to. Fail Mastro's Las Vegas. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was missing salt, it was rather bland. The creamed corn was a bit watery, unlike its usual creamy consistency. The corn was also mushy, probably over cooked. That is always a favorite but they seamed to mess that one up too. The creamed spinach was rich but tolerable. Aside from the shrimp cocktail and key lime pie, the dinner was meh.  Update: 5/24/15  Mastro's reached out to me shortly after our visit but I somehow missed their attempt. After four months of not seeing their message, I immediately called back and spoke to the manager last Saturday. He apologized for our experience and told me that the GM would give me back a call on Sunday... Well, a week later and I hear crickets. No missed calls or messages. Nothing. Wow, this is an even bigger let down. The second fail requires that I update my review... Mastro's kitchen, staff (ie. Management) clean up your act.  I'd take away that one star if I could.",

Here, the experience was very different.   We sat next to the bar in one of tgeir high tables. Started with an Escargot appetizer. However, the appetizer did not come with the Escargot schells which defeated the purpose of the experience of working your way through this delicatessen in anticipation of savoring your find. We have been dining at Matro's for 15 years and always order Escargot on schells. That is how is served!  All along the waiter kept pressuring us to order something else to drink besides water! The next appetizer was seared ahi tuna, which was overly spiced and was no presented well..  Some how the waiter probably felt we were not worthy of her service, so we caught her drinking beer with other customers at the next table over.  We decided not to order anything else and asked for the check which came 20 minutes later. As far as we were concerned this venue does NOT maintain its reputation and status consistantly across other locations.  Very disappointed, to say the least.",

He recommended us a good bottle of vino and it went perfect with our steaks! We had both the Japanese wagyu and the bone in fillet steak. Creamed spinach and potatoes were a perfect combo to the Japanese wagyu that melts in the mouth! They do give generous servings that what we had were good enough to share. We had sauteed shrimps for appetizer that was really filling.  Get the butternut cake -if you are into something savory than sweet. It's huge, great for sharing as well!",

    "text": "Quite an exquisite appearance; I'm impressed!   I came here on a short weekend trip with my hubby and was told that their steak is delicious from hearsay. So of course being the steak lovers that we are, we had to try this place out! We ordered two crab cakes, a steak entree for myself, fish fillet for the hubby & lobster mashed potatoes for our side entree to share. The crab cake appetizer was packed with ample crab meat; though I did feel that it lacked a bit in flavor. There was a side of greens topped with avocado which I didn't think complimented the crab cakes very well. The 22oz steak was DELICIOUS and yep, you bet I finished all 22oz of it! NOT! This hunk of meat was humongous and of course I shared it with my hubby! It was cooked to perfection at medium rare; nice and tender! Served sizzling hot on a scorching plate; I devoured every bite of my steak! My hubby's halibut was very good; soft and tender with a nice creamy sauce mixture. The lobster mashed potatoes was good. It was also super creamy with a hint of garlic. They weren't too generous with the lobster meat but  I wasn't expecting much beforehand.  Service here was definitely not up to par. Considering I had made reservations at 8:30pm TWO WEEKS prior to our arrival, I was hoping that we'd at least have to wait for ehh, maybe a good 10 minutes. NOPE. We were running a bit late that night and I called the restaurant at 8:15 to inform them that we were on our way and the lady confirmed that our table will be waiting. We get there around 5 minutes pass our reservation time (not as late as we thought after all!) and the lady tells us that it's actually going to be another 50 minute wait!? WHAT?! Though she did apologize that they were behind schedule, apart of me was just a wee bit frustrated. She should have at least have the decency to let us know ahead of time when I phoned in so we didn't have to rush over! Well nonetheless, we went to the sushi restaurant next door and surpassed time at the bar.   The treehouse architecture of this restaurant is out of the ordinary and quite astounding! Built inside the Crystal mall - it has a unique structure to it. Entrance is accessible through the second floor; the restaurant is built from the 1st ground floor up.    All in all, my hubby and I had a very scrumptious and fulfilling dinner together! I would highly recommend for all steak-lovers to be sure to check this place out if they're ever in Vegas! :)",

We were seated 5 minutes later, I'm really not sure what the deal was, but we didn't have to wait. Drinks were good as was the service, however the food was not great. The mac and cheese was lacking the cheese. I ordered lamb chops and they were cooked ok, medium rare, but lacked flavor. Totally not impressed. I ate half my lamb, and we got a go bag for everything else. When I got home my lamb never made it to the go bag. Really? $48 for 1/2 an order of lamb. This place is pathetic. Go to Del Frisco's if you truly want to be impressed. Epic fail here!",

    "text": "I've debated about how many stars I should rate Mastro's Ocean Club, technically it deserves one less due to what happened during my dinning experience here but the customer service made up for a lot of the mistakes.  I was in Vegas with my girlfriend who had been there for a company conference, it so happened to also be my birthday weekend and I wanted an amazing meal on my Birthday before we headed back to LA. Mastro's had always been well recommended by friends and family so i was excited to have a birthday meal there. We have a few locations in the Los Angeles area but never had a opportunity to dine at one.   We arrived a few minutes after opening and were seated promptly, our server (I forget his name :( so sorry) was amazing! Was very informative and accommodating. My girlfriend ordered the chilean sea bass and one prawn. I had the bone in rib eye steak and we shared a side of green beans and asparagus. My girlfriend ordered a delicious drink and while I couldn't decide on what to have myself our waiter brought out a amazing whiskey drink for me.   Once the food arrived it all looked so yummy, and here is when the problems began. I had ordered my steak medium rare, when I cut into the steak it was more medium / medium well. I thought maybe it was just the surrounding edges that were overcooked because that tends to happen with rib eye steaks. Once I cut closer to the bone it was evident it was overcooked. I called over the waiter and quickly had my steak sent back and a new one was on its way out. My girlfriends sea bass was amazing but the prawn she ordered was overcooked. While I waited for my replacement steak to arrive the manager came to our table to offer their apologies which was much appreciated. My replacement steak took quite some time enough time for my girlfriend to finish her meal while I sat there waiting for my food.   Once my new steak arrived I was eager to eat, the manager had them bring out fresh new sides which was unexpected but very appreciated. Manager had me cut into the steak to see if it was cooked properly and sadly it was also overcooked. I was disappointed and as I cut further in to check the center of the steak it was evident this steak was overcooked as well as chewy. The manager acknowledged it was overcooked and offered a replacement but at this point I just wanted to eat! I told him it was ok and that I would finish my steak and be on our way, needless to say my steak was comped. A few minutes into my second steak the manager let me know that they had another steak for me and I should slow down on finishing this one. I advised him I had no desire for a third steak and that there was no way I could finish it but he insisted.  My third steak was brought out and my second was taken away, again the manager asked me to check the cook on this third steak. Upon cutting into the steak it was raw, very raw...almost a blue steak. I was really disappointed at this point and the manager just walked away. Our server came to our table and asked me \"Do you like your steak like that?\" acknowledging how undercooked it was. At this point I was so upset that I just wanted to eat but could only finish a few extra bites. The manager brought out a free dessert with Happy Birthday written on the dish which was freaking delicious. The customer service is is really fantastic I can't stress that enough. Drinks are fantastic and the wait staff is top notch! And the steak was fantastic the next day when I had to for lunch and was reheated to a proper temp ;)   I'll definitely return here for a second meal regardless of all the problems I experienced as I truly believe they deserve a second chance and I'll update my review accordingly. Thanks again to the staff at Mastro's Ocean Club for great service and attention. Special thanks to our waiter who was fantastic and to the manager who went above and beyond.",

It not the traditional Mastro's setting but the food was still remarkable! Our waiter Deion was the man he helped my friend choose the perfect wine to accompany his bone-in filet topped with foie gras! Which just melted in ur mouth!

But regarding the experience:  Food:4 stars Service: 1 star Price:2 start Average:2.5 star.. but I rounded up because my meal was courtesy of MGM... thanks casino host!  I was seated by the hostess.. then I waited.. and waited... and waited.. for menus.  After making continuous eye contact with the wait staff, displaying my need for service, I was ignored.  Then maybe after 10 mins, I received a menu, but still had to ask for water.  Shocking, as this is supposed to be a nicer restaurant.. You would think with these prices, would come service.  Also, during our dinner, I had numerous times where I was looking an empty champagne glass.. and no I'm not a fast drinker... If you are going to place the bottle in a ice bucket stand on the other side of the table, please be mindful of when to fill my glass... I know this may sound snobby, but i have no problem pouring my own glass.. however, I believe they should keep a close eye, especially since there was plenty of staff just standing around.  The mussels were probably one of the best I've had! This was a nice surprise, as most steamed mussels are quite standard with white wine, garlic and parsley.  But this had some sort of light and creamy sun-dried tomato sauce! it was thin enough to compliment these under the sea delights, but hearty enough to dip with bread!  The crab cake was also divine!  Definitely no fillers here.. instead, a cake-shaped form of literally pure crab!  The Chilean sea bass was prepared really great, especially for a white fish!  Overall, I would definitely check this place out, ESPECIALLY if you have a food/bev comp through MGM hotels.  However, I still prefer Sage over this place.  The service really stood out to me, and it was HORRIBLE!  Dear waitstaff.- please be kind to your customers, especially in the city of where splurge-worthy tips are common!  And to the tall, 60 year old server with some salt and pepper action going on ontop of that head.. stop winking at ladies.. you're creeping people out!!",

We ordered the Mastro's Signature Seafood Tower of shrimps, lobster, Alaskan King crab legs, Alaskan Red King crab claws, and Kusshi oysters. The shrimps were plump & juicy, as was the lobster. The crab was sweet & succulent. The oyster were very fresh. On the side were cocktail sauce, mustard, and our favourite, atomic horseradish, where a little goes a long way! In addition to the seafood tower, we had the Alaskan King crab black truffle gnocchi. As it approached our table, the smell of the black truffles was very evident. Atop the gnocchi was a parmesan & bread crumb topping, which was baked until golden brown. We added a few lemon drop martinis, which were pour table side. It steamed as the liquid touched the ice.   The service was amazing. The waiter was super friendly, and the water boys were attentive. I never saw the bottom of my glass. The ambiance was very delightful. It just made the meal even better. We loved every element of this meal!",

Secondly, a table with 6 people ordering steaks shouldn't have all six returned multiple times for being undercooked. They even served the salads warm.   I have dined at this restaurant more than a dozen times and have recommended it even more than that. I now regret having sent anyone there. In addition to ruining the meals of my entire travel party, the food poisoning had me confined to my room for the entire trip.   If you're thinking about going to this restaurant, dine at your own risk. IT WAS THE WORST MEAL I HAVE EVER EATEN!!",

    "text": "Service:  Seemed hectic(?) although there didn't seem to be much going on for a Wednesday evening. I didn't feel like I was at a $$$$ restaurant. The waiter took awhile to come over once seated and the pacing of the meal was very odd. The bone marrow took 20 minutes to come out which was fine, (we were warned of this) but the lobster bisque soup took another 20 minutes after that, and we sat around for 20 minutes with nothing to eat between soup and dinner.   Location:  Looks wonderful. We sat in the cool wooden treehouse thing. The problem is, there is no climate control. It was HOT. I sweated throughout the meal. Shame. I didn't really get a good feel of being \"in the air\" or a good view. I think it looks cooler from the outside.  Drinks: The lemon drop was delicious and fun with the smoking dry ice. The tiki-time was fine although forgettable.  Food: The bread basket was interesting. It wasn't warm? Some of the pieces were tough to eat and made a real crumb mess...  Bone marrow appetizer was good. Although I think we both preferred the side salad with capers and cheese to the actual bone marrow.  Lobster bisque was fine. There were some interesting complex flavors, but my partners portion had a shell in it. (not ok for fine dining...)  I had the recommended 12oz bone-in filet for dinner. It was seasoned well. I ordered medium-rare. Maybe 1-2 bites near the bone were medium rare. The rest was brown all the way through. The meat was incredibly tender and well seasoned but the temperature was all over the place. They do serve it on a 400 degree plate (why?) that made all of the side dishes on my plate scalding hot...  Partner had the halibut filet with panko cheese crust. The crust was slightly burnt. The fish was incredibly overcooked, dry and tasteless. The waiter noticed our dis-interest and had it removed from the bill...  The lobster mashed potatoes were fine, although certainly nothing fabulous. The sauteed asparagus was also adequate.   Would not recommend.",

    "text": "I have never been to a fancy steakhouse before, and I have learned that they are incredibly awesome!  We booked a reservation ahead of time, so getting seats were very convenient and we were seated right away. Our server for the evening was Craig and he was a very personable man, who was very helpful throughout the entire evening. He had an answer for any question I threw his way and he explained things that they were offering off the menu very well as well.   Our appetizer came out first, which were their ahi tuna tostadas. They were very delicious. The tostada portion was very crunchy and had the perfect texture. The avocado and tuna that they served on the tostada were so soft and had a buttery texture, which was heaven in my mouth. Our entrees then came out with our sides. I ordered the bone in ribeye with an 8oz prawn, while by brother ordered the Kansas City strip. Both of our steaks were cooked to perfection. I ordered mine medium and my brother ordered medium-well, and it came out exactly as expected. For our sides, we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes along with creamed spinach. The lobster mashed potatoes were supposedly their most popular side, and I can see why. They had a good amount of lobster in that dish and it added a nice change to plain mashed potatoes. The creamed spinach was very creamy and rich. I personally could only handle so much, but they did prepare it very well. Since we went there for my birthday, they provided a complimentary slice of cake for me to eat, and it was a 5 layered chocolate cake. Their cake is some of the best cake I have ever had. I have no way to describe the taste besides \"clean.\" It stayed together very well, the flavor wasn't too strong, and the texture was perfect.   To say the least, the service and food was some of the best I have ever had all in all. I definitely could not eat here on a regular basis, but for special occasions, this will definitely be on the list.",

Our server was great and attentive, and we had to stop ourselves from eating all the fresh bread.  We weren't overly hungry so we shared a larger filet mignon. It was decent, but it wasn't as tender as others I've had before. The stone crab was delicious and I'd want to try their sea bass on a future visit. My bf has a sweet tooth, so we ordered sorbet for dessert. We got three of the largest scoops we've ever seen in our life! I joked for that size they should've given us one of each flavor instead of making us pick one. We only finished one scoop.",

    "text": "My fiance and I went here to celebrate our engagement. His parents had gotten us a very generous gift card to use for exactly that purpose since they live far away and couldn't be here to celebrate with us.  Based on all the great reviews, we decided to spend it here.  I wouldn't go so far as to say it was the best steakhouse we've ever been to, but it was pretty damn good. We ordered Blue Point oysters, which were fresh and delicious. The sauteed scallops were absolutely to die for. It comes with bread to dip in the buttery sauce and it was so amazing.  Then we ordered a filet, the sea bass, lobster mashed potatoes and Gorgonzola mac n cheese. While still very tasty, each item had some issues.  The lobster in the mashed potatoes were a bit overcooked and slightly chewy.  The mac n cheese had no hint of Gorgonzola at all and as soon as it slightly cooled while sitting at our table, the thick top layer of cheese became hard and rubbery.  The filet was good and perfectly cooked, but I've had much better steak elsewhere.  And last, the sea bass wasn't the melt in your mouth buttery bite of heaven as I expected.   The service is great. Everyone said congratulations since we had put that we were celebrating our engagement in the reservation details. Our server was super busy but she checked on us often. The ambiance is definitely strange as you're in a mall. It's really loud and not intimate at all. You're very close to other tables. Ours was right on the back of a booth, and the guys in that booth kept accidentally knocking over our table lamp.   Overall, I'm really glad we tried it out, but will stick to our favorite next time we want to splurge on a dinner.",

    "text": "Second time at this location. As always solid from the taste and preparation of the steaks.   This review is really for a more bizarre experience. Ordered a Manhattan which they pour table side into a martini glass. About 5 minutes into my drink the base of the glass literally explodes, splitting into several pieces. Luckily the drink landed on its stem and so none of the drink spilled.   I immediately alerted the waiter to the bizarre situation. The handling of this was appropriate, but not great. First the waiter understandably seemed perplexed. After assessing the glassware myself I came to the conclusion it occurred because they had apparently chilled the martini glass; and as it came back quickly to room temperature it shattered. In any case, the waiter asked me if the drink was okay. Ha. Yes, the drink is fine. No glass made it into the drink. By the way I am fine too, no need worry there is little bits of glass in front of me. The waiter took away my glass to pour it into a new one which was again acceptable. Later on in the meal though I actually cut myself on a random tiny piece of glass that was left on the table cloth. Just my luck (no pun intended Vegas), but again its not the restaurant's fault. The cut was small and did not have to amputate so decided not to ruin the mood and make a big deal about the glass. However, ones expectations eating at an establishment like Mastros is high and the entire experience did not meet that expectation.   Next time maybe my luck will be better. Until then beware of exploding glassware. Suggestion to Mastro's: do not freeze stemware.",

I have long given up on the entrees at Mastros. I have never received an entree that lived up to standards.   We ordered the following:  Clam chowder- pretty good  Lobster bisque- delicious Crab coctail- amazing Crab cakes- way too fishy Lobster mashed potatoes- amazing Gorgonzola Mac n cheese- too rich for my taste. Could only have one bite  Brussel sprouts- perfect Bone marrow- burnt to a crisp and could not scrape any marrow out  Butter cake- the one thing that saved the entire meal   In the future , I will have dinner elsewhere and come to Mastro's for coffee and dessert only.",

Located in the newly designed City Center, just look for the beautifully designed \"tree house\", which hangs high above the ultra chic boutiques in Crystals that only the richest of the rich can actually shop in.  Be sure to request a table inside the tree house...it's where all the cool kids sit.   Mastro's is not cheap, but then again, nothing in Vegas is.  In any case, it's worth every penny because the food is outstanding.  I started off with a very rich and tasty New England Clam Chowder.  For my entree, I went with the porcini mushroom crusted sea bass with fried spinach.  It was light but delicious!! Perfect for lunch.  For the side dish, what else but the lobster mashed potatoes! I'm not talking about lobster flavored mashed potatoes.  No, no, not at Mastro's.  I'm talking about over a pound of lobster mixed in the mashed potatoes.  It was soooo good and was big enough that all four of us could enjoy it with plenty to spare.  Although we were happily stuffed, our waiter brought out their signature butter cake with fresh whipped cream on the side for dessert; with his compliments (a very nice touch, which only further highlighted the tremendous service that we had during our entire meal). I highly recommend getting this dessert no matter how full you are. We all loved it.  I should note that the cocktails were also great.  Make sure you get one of their signature martinis, which comes with dry ice on the bottom of the glass that makes the drink bubble and emit smoke.  Pretty cool.   Although I was able to get a table for four for lunch on a Saturday with ease through OpenTable, that won't last long because the restaurant only opened up 2 weeks ago and the buzz is still building.  Soon, Mastro's will one of the hottest tables in Vegas so get in while you can.",

Mike R was our amazing server. His expertise was supported by and flanked throughout our experience by several other servers thus we never went lacking for anything at anytime. We feasted on crab, shrimp, oysters, and escargot appetizers followed by various soup and salad presentations. All were a \"cut above\" the normal \"starter\" course anywhere on the strip. From there it just kept getting better & better as the ribeye, scallops, new york strip, more oysters, fillet represented the breadth of our entree courses. The accompanying sides: crab gnocchi, asparagus, sugar snap peas could not have been better anywhere!   Now, we had been tipped off about Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake which defies human description. One just has to believe that it is literally to die for!   All-in-all, this experience represented the absolute best, bringing together our great friends & family with fantastic food & amazing ambiance!   Thanks Mike R. Thanks Mastro's. We will be back!",

But then for the main entree I got the bone-in filet with a side of Mastro's mashed potatoes.  The meat was perfectly cooked to medium rare and the flavor was melt-in-your-mouth delicioso.  Even the simple mashed potatoes was creamy and savory.  It sure is a splurge but I highly recommend it if you are in Vegas and want to pamper your tastebuds.",

We were greeted at our table with 2 glasses of champagne to celebrate. We spilt the most delicious wedge salad and it was good. Last year we had apps and the lobster mashed potatoes as a side. Those were so good they'll make you wanna slap your momma!  We were so full I am embarrassed to say we didn't even finish our steaks. This year we switched to Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese...epic!  I had the bone-in ribeye and my wife ordered the 12oz filet mignon.  Both were the finest steaks we've ever had. You will never appreciate any other steak after that. Mastros ruined steak for me, talk about melt in your mouth. Our server Mark was phenomenal and super attentive. A really nice guy. For desert they brought out the warm butter cake...wonderful!  Mastros is the only place I would eat in my life if I had the choice. Thank you  for a wonderful first anniversary dinner. GO THERE!!!!",

For starters, we requested Mike R as our server due to the many good things we read here and he didn't disappoint. Made our dinner and all round experience very memorable.  Everyone made us feel so special from the hostess to the busboys.  Oh, the food!!  We knew the portions were reportedly large and Mike encouraged us to order half portions. We had half Spicy Mambo Salad - Caesars salad with horseradish and wasabi - really yummy with a nice kick to it and lots of chunks of Parmesan. We loved it! My husband had the 12 oz filet and I had the 12 oz bone-in filet. Both were done to perfection and very flavorful.  Mike suggested ordering only one side to split. My husband can't resist fresh fries, especially with steak, so we got the salt & vinegar fries. They were so good and so addictive, we couldn't stop eating them even though we were stuffed.  Then came dessert!  Special occasions get comp dessert here, but Mike went over and above for us as he said he had never served anyone celebrating a 40th wedding anniversary before. We not only got the warm butter cake with ice cream and a hugh side dish of fresh made whipped cream (and yes it is every bit as good as reported), he added 4 hugh chocolate covered strawberries and 2 glasses of an amazing appertif- Michele Chiarlo Nivole.  A truly awesome evening we will never forget!  Oh, and they called us the next day to thank us for coming! We can't wait to return.",

    "text": "Let me start from the beginning here. I was searching for a good date spot for me and my gf. I have dined at most of the finer restaurants in Vegas. But I wanted to try something new and by far, this was the best reviewed spot. Only thing that turned me off was that it was in the middle of a mall. NOT AN ISSUE. I requested the 'Tree House' and that is where we were sat. Once in there I completely forgot I was in a mall...it was romantic and beautiful. Our server greeted us and asked if we've ever diner here before....we both responded \"NO\". We were then treated to a 5 minute explanation of their entire menu. Based on other reviews...we started with the shrimp cocktail and I suggest you do the same. Very unique and brilliant presentation. My gf had the Fillet of Arctic Char \"Oreganata\"..we both LOVED it. I had the Bone In Rib-Eye. Cooked perfectly. Delicious. For sides we chose the mac-n-cheese(not bad, but kinda bland to what I've had at comparable restaurants) and the brussel sprouts...fantastic. We had no room for dessert. Cocktails were good....coming from a guy in that business. As we left, EVERYONE thanked us for coming...from busser to manager. That was impressive. I even woke up the next morning to a voicemail from them thanking me for me business and hoping that me and my 'beautiful' gf had a great time; and that they hope to see us again. ONLY complaint..and this is being picky: when our bread was dropped off(with multiple choices), it was just thrown down with no explanation as to what was what. But this is a must go!",

The staff, the atmosphere, and the food combined to bring us back the next night as well  We were able to make reservations through Yelp and OpenTable but we arrived early each night and sat in the first come, first serve bar area.  The piano entertainment was first class. Our server, Racqel, was always timely, willing to meet our every request, and helpful in navigating the menu to ensure we got the most of the food choices we desired with the least amount of waste.  Her name escapes me now but there was a corporate employee there the second night who recognized us from the night before.  She not only bought our first round of drinks but when we were leaving insisted we try their \"Butter Cake\" so much so that she ended up giving it to us.  Very good stuff. I can't imagine anyone not feeling good upon receipt of this restaurant \"regular\" type of treatment on a 3 day, 2 night trip.  Sheri and I can't wait to return to town and visit the place again!  I highly recommend any of the filets, shriimp cocktail, king crab, lobster mashed potatoes, lobster bisque, gorgonzola mac and cheese, and the red snapper.  They will split any plate they have, upon request.",

Clam chowder was ok, we had better at the Fisherman's Wharf in San Francisco.  Maine lobster was a bit overpriced but very fresh. 5 waiters came to take out the shell! Girlfriend was amazed Round eye steak was very  generous. Well cooked, and the outside was pretty crispy despite asking for medium rare. Inside was soft and moist as expected. Got the cream spinach on the side. Martinis were very strong and plentiful. Water melon martini was very good. We definitely started to speak more loudly and laughing for no reason after a few full glasses.  Atmosphere overall feels very open, live music is excellent. Waiters were attentive and professional without feeling overwhelmingly present. Girlfriend had a great time so it deserves the 4 stars. Overall, a great experience though a tad pricey, especially the lobster.",

    "text": "The name Mastro's is known to a lot of people for their steaks already.  We happened to be in Vegas for our anniversary, so we decided to have dinner there as our celebration.  Because this place is located at the City Center right in the middle of the mall, so it doesn't carry the same kind of \"exclusiveness\" as the one in Costa Mesa or B Hill.  Dress code is also easier, only required hotel casual, so shorts and tees are welcome.  Just as mentioned by most, the staff are extremely polite and friendly, that was a great start already.  We got seated fairly quickly and our waiter brought us the wine / cocktail list quickly.  I asked for the Mastro's Mojito cocktail, which is rum with lime and mint.  It's not very strong and I like it a lot.  We were aware of the portion at Mastro's, and since my wife is pregnant she can't eat too much.  So I asked the waiter if it's OK for us to split the steak and allow us to try more other dishes.  They were very understanding and said absolutely no problem at all.  For appetizer, we went ahead and ordered the sauteed scallops.  We were both very very impressed with the dish.  Three gigantic scallops, all prepared and seared to perfection, and the sauce was awesome together with the bread.  It was very rich and good.  We also ordered the lobster bisque, and they went ahead and split the soup between two bowls for us, that was very nice.  The waiter also came and helped us split the scallop appetizer on our dish, that's great service.  We also tried the pretzel bread together with the soup, they all paired together very well!!!!!!  My wife particularly loved the lobster bisque.  She commented that a lot of times the lobster bisque she has is way too salty, but the one we had was just right.  Very smooth and rich in lobster flavor, but it doesn't get overpowered by the saltiness.  For steak, we ordered the bone-in 18oz filet and we asked them to split a small portion for my wife (medium well).  Mine was cooked medium rare.  It was simply fabulous.  Meat was very tender and juicy, and even my wife's portion, though cooked medium well, was still very tender.    And I have to say one of the most important thing they did right was resting the steak well before serving.  Most of the time when I eat steak, by the end it was juice all over the dish.  But not this time, all the juice was retained inside, that was awesome.  We also got the lobster mashed potato as side dish.  It's good, a lot of lobster as stated by others, though I agree with my wife, while it's good, for $36 bucks, it's basically lobster mixed with mashed potato.  It doesn't have that \"specialness\" in some sense.  Since it was our anniversary, they gave us a big chocolate cake.  It was BIG, and it tasted really good too!  At the end of the day, we were impressed with the dinner.  It's not cheap by any means, but for special occasions, the quality and quantity of food?  I think it's worth it.  Although part of me still wonder how the experience would differ if we were to go to the one at Costa Mesa.",

For a starter i had the wedge salad you can never go wrong with the wedge :). As my main course i had the filet mignon which i absolutely love!!!!! Its so tender it melts in your mouth and the flavor is beyond amazing! Most restaurants don't know how to season their meats :/ Not Mastros. My mom was even amazed with the flavor of the filet. FYI my mom is a picky eater :/ actually so am I haha. We ordered three sides to share (the portions are pretty big just to throw out there). There was 4 of us In our party and we had lots of left overs. We had the Mac n cheese (a must have) creamed spinach and sauteed mushrooms. Dessert time we had the butter cake.

    "text": "Came here for a friend's Birthday.   The service was superb, a big thank you to Peter our waiter for dealing with such an unruly large party!  I had the Kansas City Strip Steak...was amazing. They use a great rub or some other seasoning.   We started with a couple dozen Oysters which were fantastic, and not too expensive. All the sides were great, including the potatoes and spinach.   Great wine selection, and its only 2X for certain bottles of wine. We had 3 bottles each around $100 but top vintages of some great wineries in Napa.   I believe the birthday boy got a free desert of some kind, but at that point in the meal I was having to much fun to notice.   This is a clean, fun, and delicious higher-end place to eat with friends. I will definitely be back",

It pains me to say that the food unfortunately was not good this time. Upon arrival, they seated us pretty promptly, in around 5 minutes or so. By the time the waiter came by, 20 minutes had passed - I get it, a restaurant gets busy, so I didn't think much of it. We ordered the entire meal at once -  crab, iceberg wedge, and the Ahi tuna tartare as our appetizers - these were the best part of our meal. Our main dishes took an hour to come out and the waiter didn't come by to check on us, etc. My husband ordered the bone-in ribeye and I ordered the filet. Both steaks were to be cooked medium, but they were cooked well and seasoned so heavily with pepper and salt that I could barely taste the meat. It made the meat so dry. We also ordered green beans, mashed potatoes and mushrooms for the sides...the green beans lacked flavor; they tasted like nothing. The mashed potatoes and mushrooms were okay.  In any case, I was disappointed at this place - some things were good, but others were subpar, given it is Mastro's.",

I probably won't be coming back but I'm glad I finally got to try it.  lobster mashed potatoes - it was actually pretty good!  the lobster taste and the mashed potatoes really mixed in well together.  I've heard that this dish wasn't as good in the costa mesa one  bone-in-filet - very tender and very good!  bone-in-kc strip - i loved it  i loved everything that was bone in.  I didn't get to try the bone-in-ribeye because it was too big  we also got a side of asparagus which is like $10 (not worth it).  although it was good, it tasted like I can cook this at home for so much cheaper, and it would taste the same.  nothing special at all",

    "text": "Recently dined here to celebrate a friend's birthday - what a great choice! Mastro's is centrally located on the Las Vegas Strip at the Crystals Shops. Part of the restaurant has this cool area called the 'Treehouse' which overlooks the shops below. Mastro's has a pretty even ratio of steaks/chops and seafood items. Once you're seated they bring a nice assortment of breads in a basket (my guest liked the pretzel rolls especially). There's a good amount of appetizers and even sushi and about 8 salad options. As we both recently had steak - we decided to order seafood - I ordered the Grouper and my guest had the Fillet of Arctic Char (very similar to salmon but not as 'fishy' IMO) and we shared sauteed asparagus, twice baked potato and steamed broccoli - it was A LOT of food and we ended up taking stuff home. Both fish were very nice and flavorful and prepared just right and the side dishes are served family style so one side dish is at least good for 2 - 3 people (if you have a group order different ones to share). Make sure to save room for desert for the 'famous' warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream and fresh whipped cream. OMG!! This will take cae of any sweet tooth! LOL They put a candle and wrote 'Happy Birthday' in chocolate on the plate and my friend absolutely loved it and so will you! I recommend making reservations as it gets busy. Bring your appetite and enjoy!",

    "text": "Okay the food here is AMAZING! For starters I recommend the crab cake or the ahi tuna. The bone in filet mignon is to die for and the butter cake is the only dessert you should ever order.   Now, that being said I have given this place two tries and if you're going to eat here you better have plenty of time and no plans for the rest of the night. The first time was with my husband for my birthday and it took about an hour to get our appetizers and the restaurant was far from occupied. Not only did it take an hour but then the appetizers were burnt and had to be made again. We ended up being so late that we had to get our food to go. The second time we didn't make any plans but the service was very mediocre. The bussers kept bumping into my chair, the server disappeared for a while, the food took a long time (as expected) and when it came time for dessert they brought us out a cake for our anniversary and left before I could order a butter cake for dessert. I would have gladly paid for it but the next time we saw the waiter he dropped the check and left again.   The food really is amazing. There isn't much ambiance and maybe my expectations are always too high for the service.",

It was my husband's birthday, so we brought our appetites and we should've brought the deed to our house as well... more about that later. We had reservations and were seated promptly. Our server was Michael, a lovely gentleman and self -proclaimed foodie like us. We started with foie gras, Dungeness crab cocktail a dream berry and lemon drop. We ended with butter cake and key lime pie, in between was a New York strip Oscar style which was tender and flavorful in every bite. Halibut, more dream berry, and neat shots of glenlivet 15 year chased with pelligrino. No complaints whatsoever, but everything is a la carte and very rich, like maybe they should offer complementary heart surgery instead of after dinner mints rich. Not cheap, we left $717 lighter, tip not included but it was worth it to indulge and celebrate life.... while shortening it considerably. Eat up!",

The group started with the smoked salmon, fried calamari, and some shrimp dish (i'm allergic so I don't remember what it was exactly). The smoked salmon was delicious. Not anything special necessarily, but it sure was delicious. The fried calamari was cooked perfectly and came with such a delicious sauce, a superb aioli as opposed to the more traditional tomato sauce.  One thing the group really appreciated was that Mastro's agreed to specially make a burger for one individual who didn't want to eat steak. Of course, the individual got sick, but we were so appreciative of their willingness to accommodate us that we asked to have the burger brought out and we all shared it - cut it up into sliders. They were melt-in-your-mouth incredible. For a classy steakhouse, Mastro's sure makes an incredible burger.  I had the Chilean Sea Bass for my entree, most everyone else had steaks. Boy am I glad I went with the Sea Bass though, I was already feeling a bit full from the appetizers and then the sides on top sure was a lot of food. The fish was cooked perfectly, seasoned excellently. Flaky and fairly light actually, it was a good sized helping as well. Would definitely get again.  For sides the table all raved about the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, but I'm allergic, so I couldn't eat it. Which was fine by me because the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese was heavenly. And the portion of the side was enormous. Honestly, I could've had the mac and cheese side as my entire meal and gone home happy.  Food was great, service was as good as expected, just a wonderful meal overall. Would go back again in a heart beat.",

Mastro's is quite the experience -- from the structure itself, to the wondrous items and their presentations, to the exceptional and classy staff.  You salivate as you picture-perfect dishes being carried by.    The seafood tower is a spectacle - double tiered dish with dry ice smoke surrounding it.  I have no idea how the waitstaff can carry that giant concoction.  It came to the table and shocked us at first sight.  The shrimp were the size of my fist, the crab legs were monstrous, and everything was overwhelming.  If you can eat after that appetizer, then hats off to you!    As luck would have it, I was crazy hungry, so I went for the 22 oz Bone-in Ribeye.  It came out on a plate sizzling at 400 degrees.  Perfection!  Medium rare to the T.  That was the second best Ribeye I've ever had (first being V&A).  I wanted to pick up the bone and start gnawing.    Someone else got the Halibut cheek which also looked very unique and delicious.  I really wanted to order it.  Alas, as a Texan, Ribeyes speak to my heart (on so many levels?)    This is definitely one of classiest places that I've been to.  What an upscale Vegas experience.",

After being met by the friendliest server in a city of friendly servers, we were about to eat our own arms as food arrived. The sides were great - but the halibut was so rubbery and dry. We sent it back and by the time 2x new ones arrived - we had eaten enough sides we were full and didn't really get to enjoy it.    I was going to give 3* then remembered the worst part. When the bill arrived, the server smiled and said I hope that's ok - I thought great, she'll have taken off the overcooked entrees. Opened it up and last item was -$xx for 2x entrees. Perfect. But then the total felt too big still - so checking back up the menu, they had ADDED the 2nd lot of recooked fish then removed it again at the bottom so it looked just removed - most people after a couple of drinks no way would've noticed that. SUPER sneaky. Kinda took the edge off the whole experience really - doubt we'll be back",

    "text": "**This review is for the bar area only**  I've heard many great things about this restaurant, and after reading other Yelp reviews I decided what better time to try this place out than my birthday? And what better way than sitting at the bar, and partaking of some artistically created adult beverages?  For starters this place is located smack in the middle of the Crystals Mall, you can't miss it. It's the big wooden orb shaped thing that seams to be floating in the center of all the action. It's pretty neat, but as other reviews mentioned, I'm not sure I'd want to spend $200+ on a dinner with a mall atmosphere. None the less it's quite a unique experience and they did a great job (at least in the bar area) of making sure their music drowned out most of the mall sounds.  I knew the drinks here would be pricey so I was prepared for it, but for others it may be a shocker. They have an extensive list of specialty drinks starting at $16, but most are $18. I was told their in-house specialty was a lemon drop which came over dry ice, I didn't actually try it though. I did try the Chocolate Martini ($18)- which won me over because of the giant chocolate covered strawberry on the side of the glass. It truly was dessert in a martini glass! Other views were correct, when you order a martini they give you the shaker along with your drink so you can refill your glass, it's almost like 2 drinks in 1. I also tried the Banana Foster ($18), it was delicious but not what I expected. It has whipped cream, I expected it on top but it was shaken inside and gave the drink a bit of a lumpy texture.  The bf tried the Mastro's Mojito (also $18) and it honestly was not very good, it  came served in a tall glass so there was no shaker on the side. I wouldn't recommend ordering this one. His mom tried the Dragon Fire ($18), which as very tasty, but yes it was hot/spicy - not something to quench your thirst. She rounded off her evening with the Flur de Blu ($18), one I was considering as well. She liked it, but after I tried it I was glad I went with the dessert-style drinks instead.  The service was good. The bar wasn't busy so we had as much attention as we wanted. We were able to watch them make our drinks and that was a fun part of the experience. We saw all kinds of great food coming out of the kitchen so we asked for a food menu, we elected not to order anything since we'd already been there a while and run up a tab of $100. However one bar tender offered to bring us a bread basket. The bread was great and the basket came with several different types of bread, and super soft butter. Note to self for next time: ask for the bread basket when you arrive, it's free.  I think I'll drop in some time again, when I'm in the mood for a dessert martini and can afford the $18 drinks.",

I ordered the 18oz bone-in filet which is a glorious piece of meat. It was the first time in my life I didn't finish a steak.  If you're like most people you'll have ONE, maybe TWO, nights to eat out in Vegas. If you're  considering going to Mastro's, that means you're likely considering other high-end restaurants like Prime, Cut, Craftsteak etc. Regardless where you go, you're going to spend $90-$150 a person so wouldn't you be disappointed if you weren't blown away?!

    "text": "If you're a fan of beef or as I like to call it \"MEAF\" (meat + beef) then you need to go to Mastro's.  This is the second time I've eaten at Mastro's; the other was in Orange County, CA.  This is a place where you want to burn your money and empty your wallet.  Why not waste it on fine food instead of strippers and gambling.  This venue in the new Crystals City Center is a little small, but the atmosphere and location is excellent as it sits over the ledge with a great view.  A sexy live singer and a pianist playing the tunes of some 60's through 90's music.    I ordered a medium rare 22 oz Bone in Ribeye for dinner and a side of Sauteed Asparagus.  The main entree does not come with any free side orders.  Side orders are priced separately.  I didn't have to wait too long for my Ribeye as the service was excellent.  The beef was perfectly prepared and no need to add any additional seasoning.  However, I always like my food spicy so I asked for some Tabascco.  The Asparagus was ok as it complimented with my meal.  The food is exceptional for the price.  But don't buy too many drinks there as it does get expensive.  Great place to hang out and enjoy the atmosphere.",

Two people would be hard pressed to finish it, especially if you just ate a huge steak.  Pricey dinner, but large portions and good food.  Great service, fantastic location if you sit in the \"tree house\".  Live music often and usually very crowded.",

    "text": "I'm not feeling up for a lengthy review so I'll keep it brief. For two of us, without wine and dessert (the later was comp'd by our Mandarin Oriental Concierge) our tab was $230 + tip. I can say without hesitation having dined all over the world, and eaten at the best steak houses in NYC, Chicago, Palm Springs and LA, this was NOT a $230 meal. At best it was worth $120.   Food= Our seafood appetizers were delicious - oysters and shrimp. For dinner we ate fillets, lobster, au gratin potatoes, and creamed spinach. The meat was good, lobster decent, and sides very disappointing. Usually this is what makes a Steak house memorable -not here.  The warm \"pretzel bread\" and butter cake dessert were by far the most memorable portions of the meal.  Atmosphere = you're eating in a mall - albeit a beautifully designed mall with every luxury brand in the book, it's still a mall. Within the tree house where we dined, you watch mall walkers beneath you. Ouch.  Service= Very good, attentive, but not $230 good.   Overall 3 stars. For all of us Zagat's goons, I'd go with Food=21, Decor=23, Service=23.",

Decided to try this restaurant for my husband's bday after a friend's recommendation. I ordered the sea bass and my husband ordered the 20 oz rib eye! The BEST steak and sea bass we've ever had at any restaurant in Vegas.  The waiter was excellent! He knew we were sharing and decided to split both items for us ahead of time. He made an excellent recommendation on how the sea bass should be prepared (blackened) and plated our sides when our food came so we barely lifted finger :P And since they knew we were celebrating my husband's birthday he got a free chocolate birthday cake :) Will definitely be coming back here again! Excellent food, excellent service!",

    "text": "4 stars: Yay! I'm a fan.  When I called to make reservations a few weeks in advance, I had asked to be seated inside the \"tree house\" and they were able to accomodate this request.   Mastro's is a steakhouse chain that is better than most. If your school of thought is that Ruth's Chris is the pinnacle of chain steak in America, then you will be pleasantly surprised to have broadened your horizons.    What I like about Mastro's is that the dining experience is very consistent regardless of the location you choose to frequent.  This particular Mastro's is inside a shopping mall. A very nice shopping mall, but still a shopping mall. It's slightly off-putting, but does not affect the food or the service. If you wish to eat at a \"proper\" steakhouse, with burnished leather, dark wood furnishings, and Laguioles then perhaps Mastro's is not the spot for you.  If you're not too snobbish about your surroundings, I think this is a solid steakhouse in Vegas that doesn't require you to traipse through a casino to get to it.  The food is consistent with any other Mastro's so I won't dwell too much on it.   Stick with what you know.   The lobster mash, the crab and truffle gnocchi, biggest ribeye you can split with someone, or porterhouse if they insist on a tenderloin or filet.    The butter cake is worth every last calorie, so please be sure to save room for it at the conclusion of your meal.",

However i found the music to be a bit loud, but that may be because they had a full house, and therefore  the music had to be loud to overcome the conversations?    Our waiter was awesome, i cannot remember his name...he told us about the 32oz Australian Waygu tomahawk chop, and he had us hooked.  Thank you fellow yelpers for telling me that the portions here were huge.  So we decided to skip appetizers and go straight to the beef.  Oh boy was there a lot of beef.  The sides were also awesome, mac and cheese and mushrooms, they split our tomahawk and everything so that we didn't have to do it.    Our waiter recommended the butter cake, oh my goodness...it is a whole lot of cake, and it was so yummy...so glad we skipped the appetizers or we never would have finished this dessert.    We will definitely be back the next time we are in Vegas!",

    "text": "12/31/18: Considering that Mastro's had always been my favorite Vegas restaurant... I made reservations to ring in the New Year and have this be our last meal in 2018. I have never been more disappointed by any other restaurant! My absolute favorite drink is a dirty martini with extra blue cheese stuffed olives... The waiter was kind enough to fill my martini glass with plenty of olives, however, the cocktail itself was the worst I'd ever had. The martini was hardly dirty, but I decided not to complain since he was so generous with the olives. For our appetizers, we ordered the Dungeness crab cocktail as well as Alaskan red king crab claws. Dungeness crab has always been my favorite and I remember ordering this dish the last time we dined at Mastro's. The Alaskan claws were so dry and it was nearly impossibly to remove the crab meat from the shell. We had to use our napkins to do our best to break into the claws! The main meal consisted of Chilean sea bass, Alaskan King Crab legs, and scalloped potatoes. I was disappointed with every dish! The sea bass was undercooked, the scalloped potatoes were saturated with grease, and the King crab legs were by far the worst I'd ever had! The crab legs were very thin and the meat was over cooked and completely dried out! I was shocked that they had the nerve to serve such a low quality dish at such a high price. The only reason I didn't complain about the entire meal was because my boyfriend politely asked me not to. The service itself was fine and our waiter was polite and attentive. However, the quality of the food was not up to par with our previous experience. My disappointment was exasperated by the fact that New Years Eve is always a very special night, and Mastro's did not rise to the occasion.   Previous Review:  One of the best dinners we've had in Vegas! We had early reservations and the restaurant quickly filled after we arrived. The \"treehouse\" atmosphere was adorable yet elegant! The entire staff has very friendly and attentive. We ordered the Dungeness crab cocktail, Boston clam chowder, and Chilean sea bass with Ahi tune and mushrooms for our entrees. We both agreed that the Chilean sea bass was by far the best fish entree we've ever had! The sea bass was prepared perfectly (we opted for the fish to be grilled). My favorite type of crab is Dungeness... and it was super flavorful, tender and moist. Not one complaint with the entire experience. I even received a follow up phone call from the restaurant to ensure that we enjoyed our visit. We are both looking forward to returning to Mastros for another wonderful experience!",

It's located in the middle of the Crystals shopping center, but you honestly don't feel like you're in a shopping center at all once you're there.   Food wise we started with some oysters as a appetizer. They were super fresh & tasty. I preferred the west coast over east, but still both were very good. (4/5) We also were provided with complementary bread and butter. I only had a small piece since I didn't want to fill up too much. For a main entree I had the Chilean Sea Bass. It was cooked so perfectly and the texture was like butter. It wasn't over powered at all with seasoning and the fresh lemon along with it was perfection. (5/5). As a side we shared the Lobster Mashed Potatoes. It was a huge portion and the pieces of lobster were very generous. It was seriously to die for! THIS IS A MUST ORDER! (5/5) To top off our meal they provide us with a complementary anniversary dessert. It was very good, but I was just too full to eat more than a few bites.  Overall I was very impressed with the food, service, and decor of the restaurant. I will certainly be back again in the future & definitely recommend this place to others.",

Brandon & Anabelle were very patient when we called over the phone by giving us directions & telling us exactly where to go. We felt welcomed & the atmosphere is very elegant & relaxed. We had the pleasure of having Tim as our waiter. He went above & beyond for us. He knew the menu like the back of his hand. He made great conversation & was very VERY attentive. I have never had a waiter like Tim & I'm so incredibly thankful I had him tonight. Antonio was just as amazing, he had such a wonderful smile every time he approached the table. Kept up on our refills & was so polite. He removed all of our dirty plates & also put away my leftovers. I appreciate a good crew when I see one. I ordered the steamed mussels, king crab & the gnocchi. SO MUCH FLAVOR IN EVERY BITE. Black mussels had just right chewy texture with a squeeze of lemon and croutons. King crab legs were perfection with melted butter. The gnocchi was a great portion for two.  Overall if I could I would give this place a 10/10. Thank you so much to everyone!",

My husband had filet and he thought it was a little over cooked. The tuna tartare was my least favorite very mushy and tasteless. Our two favorites of meal were the shrimp cocktail and the butter cake!",

I was never in a treehouse as a child so as an adult I can appreciate it over a Chopin martini. The crab cakes were fantastic not mushy at all and you can see and taste the fresh crab meat. Calamari was good nothing crazy at least it wasn't overly greasy or chewy. Shrimp cocktail extremely fresh. Ribeye was spot on, prepared perfectly on a sizzling plate. The service as always was spot on. The best part of any Mastro's meal is by far the butter cake! So sinfully rich and decadent.",

I live at the adjacent high rise next to Crystals, & ive ordered from here over & over thinking its just been bad luck every time i get my food.. but this time ive had it. When i called in to place my order i specifically asked them to make sure i get ginger & soy sauce w/ my sushi (which should be an obvious given) but because they seem to always forget, i figured this time i would triple ask so it doesnt happen... of course i get home & what do i see? Sushi w/ NO SOY SAUCE OR GINGER. Not to mention the sushi tastes awful, old & fishy. I also ordered the sauteed shrimp which came w/ NO SAUCE!!!!!! What in the world ?!? This place is a hot mess & if the kitchen is this absent when preparing food that says a lot about management & the restaurant as a whole. Never going back nor will any of my high roller friends.",

Our waiter asked how our dinners were and my wife mentioned about the Artic Char and they offered to replace it or give her something else which she declined. The General Manager came over but my wife declined to get anything else.  I had the Key Lime Pie with their home made, absolutely wonderful, whipped cream.  All in all, the meal was very good and when we got our bill, they had taken the Artic Char off the bill.

    "text": "Take 3!!! Came here for my birthday celebration and knowing they have the best steaks in town.  Although, I have tried Mastros steakhouse and the Ocean Club, this was by far the best from customer service to the food.  If you have not been here before, Mastros Ocean Club is located in the Crystal Shops in the Aria. Since some of the other hotels charge for parking, choose to park your car in valet, as it is free. However, do not forget to tip the people.   My fiancee and I got there a little bit early, but we also had a reservation. They even sat us down early, which added more brownie points for this review. Prior to deciding if you want to go here, also make sure to let them know if you are celebrating a birthday, anniversary,  or promotion as you will be receiving a special treat at the end. Also, they can get extremely busy on other occasions. So book in advance.  The menu: they have appetizers, seafood, steaks and chops, salad, veggies and potatoes (not included in meal, considered sides) desserts, a massive wine list, cocktails, and beers. Since we were hungry and did not want to put food to waste, we ordered medium well 22 oz. Rib eye steak, cream of corn, lobster mashed potatoes, and rosemary mushrooms.   The food: they do take their time perfecting how all their steaks and chops taste. The steak, was evenly seasoned, juicy, and tender. I did not even have to use A1 steak like I normally do at other places. Makes you want to keep eating more and keep your mouth drooling for more. The cream of corn, awesome! Creamy and complimented the steak by adding some ohhh so sweet taste. The lobster mash, oh my, you thought that lobster could not get any better. This is also what they are known for. Fresh, buttery, fluffiness. Must order, and I am pretty sure you will never want regular mashed potatoes after eating this. Last, I got a complimentary chocolate cake for my birthday w/in house made whipped cream. By the end of eating, I literally could not eat the rest of my cake. We also added the chocolate pudding cake, which also was taken home.   Overall, the service was on point! Thank you to all who made this one for the books. Will be back soon.",

The service is okay, not 5 star worthy but just okay.   Let's talk about the experience of the food. My husband and I brought his parents here for Thanksgiving dinner and we were very excited to be able to treat them to a \"great\" meal. We all ordered steak and lobster, the waitress mentioned that the plates were 400 degrees and to be careful not to touch them. I wish that was True but she lied...  When they brought my plate of steak and lobster my steak was freezing cold to the touch. I told the waitress and she took 45 minutes to have her manager come out and ask me if I wanted to have them re-heat the food. At that point everyone at our table was nearly done eating. So I respectfully declined and wanted them to take it off the check. The manager then came over and was like what else can we do aside from taking it off the bill? I told him that I didn't think it was necessary because my party was done eating and we had a show to be at and I was honestly not in the mood to eat a re-heated steak. He rolled his eyes and just grabbed the plate off the table in such a horribly rude manner. Needless to say, I will never return to this location.",

This place is the most expensive restaurant I've ever been to, but to be fair I knew that before I made reservations. This was a Tuesday evening, and the restaurant was packed, so I highly recommend making reservations. I use Open Table. Mastros Ocean Club is located at City Center on the Strip adjacent to the Aria. The unique building structure looks like a gigantic whistle or modern tree house. Honestly, I'm not sure what the shape is suppose to represent, but you can't miss it when you get to City Center. We were seated inside the tree house overlooking the mall. We started with Fried Calamari which was amazing. Entree's were Pan Seared Alaskan Halibut and Chilean Sea Bass that melts in your mouth. Rosemary Garlic Sauteed Button Mushrooms and Garlic Mashed Potatoes completed the sides.  For desert we had their famous Butter Pound Cake topped with Vanilla Ice Cream. Don't even look at the dessert menu. Just get this cake. It's that good. Overall Mastros Ocean Club is a top notch restaurant that serves up a 5 Star menu, a quiet ambiance and a professional attentative staff to ensure you have a memorable dining experience. We'll be back.",

We had a large party for my husbands 40th bday last weekend we were visiting and the food and service was great!   We started with seafood towers, calamari, bone marrow and crab cakes. Everyone seemed to love it all.   Most got steak, however I got the scallops and they were delicious. I appreciated that the waiter was diligent in letting us know what others had ordered as sides so we didn't double up, which gave us an opportunity to order a different side for us to share. Of course that was split down the middle. One half of the table were able to share sides while the other half had their own. We had plenty of food.   From what I heard, the drinks were fantastic! Unfortunately being pregnant I wasn't able to partake but they were a hit at our table, which is where dessert came in for me. Wow I was surprised at how many strawberries came in the order but I was able to share and everyone enjoyed it as well.   Thank you for making my husbands birthday dinner a hit!",

We were in Vegas this week and had never been to this one until now.   Well I must say I will never go back there! Terrible service first of all.  We didn't see a waiter for first 10 min!   Drinks were great as usual.  Seafood tower- always a hit- however we said we wanted lots of shrimp and a few dunguness crab.  Got a few shrimp and tons of ( there were 4 people) crab and it was not smelling good to us! I told the waiter but he pretty much ignored me and of course charged us for all of it.  Steaks- warned about extreme hot plates(we knew about those) --ya not hot.  My son asked for a new hotter one and it was the same.  The steaks were not hot and not up to standard as we usually are used usually used to !!! I had the chopped salad 3 weeks ago in Scottsdale and it was fantastic. This time it was bitter tasting and I could barely eat it. The waiter asked if I didn't like it and I said no  .... no response from him and of course was charged.

Their Bone-In Ribeye (charred, medium-rare plus) will forever be the compared-to factor against all other steaks I come across in my lifetime.  The Ocean Club was an excellent dining experience among many in the city of Las Vegas. The great ambiance of the tree house accompanied by stellar five-star service sets a standard of elevated heights and their menu features some of the best food items in town.  Without saying anything more, I have zero complaints on my first encounter and eagerly looking forward to my next.",

    "text": "This is probably a 4.5 star review, but there really wasn't anything to gripe about, so let's ring in the New Year with 5 stars!   I've been interested in visiting Maestro's Ocean Club for quite some time. I'm a seafood lover, and a lover of fine dining, so it is right up my alley.  Located in Crystals, the layout is interesting. You simultaneously have the feeling of being in the mall, yet separated from it. There is a dome of sorts as the ceiling, so shoppers cannot see inside and gawk at the diners, but the diners can somewhat see out into the mall. Tables are a smidge close for comfort, but that's just a personal preference.  Service, as expected, was wonderful. Our server was friendly, personable, knowledgeable and professional without being overbearing. There is an extensive cocktail list, and I enjoyed my cocktail- \"Strawberry Dream\", which is very sweet, but I like sweet drinks.  For an appetizer, we split the lobster cocktail, which ended up being more meat than originally expected based on the presentation. Although the server warned us about the heat/kick of the \"atomic horseradish\", it actually was quite bearable, and complimented the lobster well.  I opted for the crab cakes as my entree, and they were also quite good. Perhaps not the best crab cakes I've ever had, but certainly a fine showing. They perhaps could have used a bit more seasoning, or some of the horseradish, but they were full of meat, and the little filler held things together well. We got a side of the Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, and wow!! Huge portion, and holy cheese, batman! Super cheesy!! Really good, very mild though.   For dessert,  we split the butter cake, and it was melt in your mouth good. Seriously. The homemade whipped cream along with the ice cream may have been overkill, but if you're going to do dessert, might as well go all out!   Of course, Maestro's is on the expensive side of things, but if you want a solid seafood fine dining experience, I wouldn't shy away from it.",

While the food was being delivered, moving the bread I spilt my drink on my steak and lap. The manager brought me a new steak, plate and drink all while apologizing for something that was an accident. They also where constantly checking tables and on the move. It was a great dinner with great customer service. They can teach the one in Newport Beach a thing or two.",

For starters, my wife's filet was cold and my ribeye was rare (ordered med). This after taking almost an hour to get our food. Our Rockefeller oysters were at best average. I would say that the highlight of our dinner was the complimentary surprise deserts in celebration of our anniversary. That was a nice touch. Also, our host was nice enough to comp one of the steaks. Still, the poor experience put a damper on our afternoon. All in all, not what we anticipated for our anniversary. Sadly disappointed.",

Our group ordered an individual plate and then we shared the sides we ordered. No quality was spared by the chefs and we indulged like kings!   It's on the higher end of the price range but it will make your trip to Las Vegas memorable and delightful.",

I appreciate that they cleared the table (and even our crumbs) immediately after the dish was finished!  We had the Chilean Sea Bass and it was cooked to perfection. We also had the Seared Scallops, which I feel are very underrated in terms of recommendations. The scallops were also perfectly cooked, and the sauce they were served in was delicious. The lobster baked potatoes were loaded with lobster!   They also gave us a complimentary slice of chocolate cake for my boyfriend's birthday. It was one of the best chocolate cakes I have had: moist, not overly sweet, and absolutely delicious.  This place is on the pricey side, but you definitely get what you pay for. Excellent food, wonderful service. I can't wait to go back!",

The hostess was very sweet. The ambiance of the restaurant was great, and it's located right inside the mall.   Service was great from our waiter and he was very attentive and helpful. My only issue was that when our server was busy and we tried to call someone over but even though other waiters were around and saw our flag down we were totally ignored.   Our food came timely, the spinach and scallop was delish! My only issue was that there was a hair in my lobster mash. I let the waiter know and he kindly took the mash away and asked to replace it. The replacement was delicious but I was already turned off with that hair.  That's why I took one star away. I felt that if I'm paying $300+ for a thanksgiving meal, it should come with high quality food, good service at all times, and that doesn't include hair in my food. I requested my steak to be medium well but it was definitely very rare. The meat was under cooked for my taste, and they were nice to recook it but it just took two times for them to make it right. & I'm reallly not a picky eater. It just sucks that the time they spent recooking in sitting there watching my party enjoy their meals.   All in all, I was dying to try this restaurant and had high hopes for it.. but I would not come back because of the high price tag and the service/food was not worth the $$",

They offer most of the same food items but for some reason Vegas is a little cheaper.   For the appetizer I got the lobster bisque and the mastros Cobb salad? I suggest ordering the salad as a half size the portion was huge even split between two people. The lobster bisque was soooooo good! I didn't want to share, but I did. I'd definitely pick that over the salad any day.  We ordered a bottle of red wine...forgot the name but it was pretty reasonable for $45.  For the main course I got the bone in ribeye, snap peas, mashed potatoes, sauteed mushrooms. All were really good! I was super full from drinking and our appitizers we had to make most of it back to our hotel. But the leftovers were still amazing as a late night snack.  I suggest sitting in the \"tree house\" it seems a little more intimate than in the other section. Lastly thy brought us out the better cake and oh my gosh! They did not have this option at the Costa Mesa one. This seriously was so good!",

    "text": "Came here for a friend's birthday celebration and the prices justified as much.  We gave our buddy a lot of crap for not being specific about tap water and we ended up with a fee of $20 for flat water.  Oh well.  I'll take the story any day.  This is definitely a white table cloth establishment.  It's not super stuffy, but this isn't the place to roll in wearing shorts and a t-shirt.  The restaurant is beautifully designed and if you can, try to sit in the \"pod\" where you get a view of the mall interior and everyone walking around.  Food was excellent.  We shared the shrimp cocktail and the vanilla battered shrimp for appetizers, and to this day, I still remember that vanilla battered shrimp.  Probably one of the best appetizers I have had.  My main course was the chilean sea bass.  The serving size was enormous and it brought off into perfect flakes during consumption.  For the side dishes we had the asparagus and scalloped potatoes.  Highly recommend either but their selection has a lot to offer.  Service was attentive as expected and best of all got to use a little bit of Polish.",

    "text": "We splurged (again) to enjoy mastro's great food and service.  This last visit was our second visit and we weren't disappointed at all.  TIP: to guarantee your spot, always make a reservation.  Las Vegas ocean club has the beautiful tree house and I even asked to sit in there.  They brought us to the bar while we waited for our table.    I was pleasantly surprised that the drinks we ordered were actually strong; usually other restaurants are stingy with their alcohol.  Maybe it was due to being in Las Vegas, but those drinks were tasty and strong.  A few minutes later we were seated inside the tree house.  The staff were very attentive to us.  We ordered ahi tuna and a filet to share. A couple of side orders of veggies, salad, crab cakes and some bread completed our meal.  I really thought that we would not have enough food but I couldn't finish it all!  We promised ourselves that we would come back just for dessert- and we did return the next day! - just for the chocolate pudding cake and their cheesecake.  I LOVE their pudding cake and I am not a chocolate person!  Again, their service was outstanding. Crazy busy on a Friday or Saturday night or slow like a Sunday dinner, the staff never forgot about you.  If you ever want to experience great service and food - consistently, mastro's ocean club in Las Vegas is a sure bet.",

    "text": "I'm no stranger to Mastro's.  I have spent many a special occasion at the one in Costa Mesa.  This is now my local Mastro's for the time being, so my boyfriend and I decided to have a nice Valentine's Day dinner at Crystals.  All-in-all, as with the other Mastro's, the food and service are top-notch.  Our waiter was attentive, friendly, and patient; other waiters provided the same level of attention to us even though they weren't assigned to our table.  Like always, we shared a 22oz ribeye, and a side order of Alaskan king crab gnocchi with black truffle.  We grabbed a second order to-go because we love that dish that much.  For Valentine's Day, we also got a complimentary order of Mastro's signature warm butter cake, which is incredibly sweet and rich.  Love it.  My only complaint is the atmosphere of this location.  The main dining room is located in an open-air treehouse structure inside the Crystals mall.  Although for Valentine's Day we were seated in one of the private dining rooms upstairs, I would imagine the atmosphere between the two is similar.  I dig the dimly lit, quiet, romantic ambience of the Costa Mesa steakhouse.  Since this location is in a mall and (mostly) open-air, you get ... a mall atmosphere.  Which is okay, but not optimal.  There also seemed to be a lot of very loud, drunk people at the restaurant, but I figure they're everywhere on the strip on a Friday night.",

You can create your own seafood tower to your liking and size. Our seafood tower had shrimp, snow crab claws and oysters. We all enjoyed especially my daughter; the cool dry ice effect and seafood tower presentation. The seafood was fresh and the oysters tasted amazing. My hubby had the lemon sole, my mom had the Chilean sea bass, my Dad had the herb roasted chicken, I had sauteed sea scallops and my daughter got to sample a little bit of everything. We shared two sides family style of their signature lobster mashed potatoes (love this combo) and the other side dish of roasted brussels sprouts. The seafood and chicken entrees and sides were served hot, fresh and perfectly seasoned. At the end, they complimentary served us their yummy signature warm butter cake dessert with vanilla ice cream and added Happy Anniversary wish which was a nice added personal touch. We had a wonderful time and food experience on our first visit here, and the service was friendly and excellent.",

Bone in ribeyes with spinach was excellent but maybe too much.  Could have split the steak leaving room for the butter cake dessert.  Also the bread is incredible.   For wine add the Stags petite syrah.  And they were generous with the wine.  Only downside was tables for two are limited and we were a twosome.  The guys big head in the both next to us was the center piece for us.  Good place for 4 to 6.  Great food and service.",

    "text": "This restaurant has become one of my all-time favorites! I've eaten here multiple times over the past 3 years, and that's says a great deal because the Strip has so many fine dining options. I've actually had the same waiter, Mike, a couple of times. His knowledge of the menu, and service to our table couldn't have been better.   My favorite entree is the Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganata style. This is a flavorful fish like sockeye salmon or snapper, not bland or mild like grouper or cod. The portions are large at Mastro's, both the entrees and the sides, and this dish is no exception. They serve 2 fillets of fish. There must be 12 to 14oz of fish on the plate. I've ordered steak here once as well, an 8oz petite filet. Is was excellent, cooked perfectly, as one would expect at a high-end restaurant.   For desert, I recommend sharing the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake. It has an amazing smooth and warm buttery taste that intensifies as you near the cake's center.   Lastly, with regard to the dining experience, the restaurant is located in the Crystals Mall, however, there is no \"mall-feel\" to the experience whatsoever. The wooden \"tree house\" dining area is an impressive sight to see, and a truly unique and beautiful open-air room to dine in.",

    "text": "In a place where restaurant service is generally lacking (Las Vegas), Mastro's hits the ball out of the park!  This is top notch service (white & black napkin service, hot hand towel service between courses, sides served onto your dish at the table, crumbing, etc.).  Notables not to miss: the crab cocktail - TRUST ME.  OMG...already shelled WHOLE pieces of crab - and so many!!!  The cocktails are awesome - do not be scared by the $15-20 prices each, you get about 2.5 martini glasses full, since they leave the cocktail shaker with (a lot) more in there.    We also had the escargot, which was a little (too) salty, even for this dish but still good and they made for a unique appetizer.  We had 3 different types of oysters, which were also good, but that is not really a refection on this restaurant since a raw oyster is a raw oyster...but they were very cold and served on a platter with dry ice, and accompanied by three different sauces, which was neat.  We shared the bone-in prime ribeye as an entree.  It was good, but Flemings is better, in our opinion.  Maybe we got a weird cut?  The dessert they brought out (complimentary) for my husband's birthday was the butter cake with ice cream.  It was excellent - my husband took that home and ate it in bed, like a heathen!  He even woke up and had some more the next day!!!  For a side, we had the lobster mashed potatoes... they were good and we are both glad we got them, but they were not worth $36, nor was there 1.5 pounds of lobster, as advertised.  That was a bit of a bummer, but we are still glad we got them once - still a tasty treat!    Nothing was bad or even just OK - it was all good and points were extremely excellent - The real stand outs were the crab cocktail, the service, and the alcoholic cocktails - these were far and above other nice restaurants!    We are so thrilled to have found this place (via a birthday gift for my husband from a friend) and are very much looking forward to coming back and trying some of the other yummy options on the menu!  Tips: ask to sit in the bird's nest.  You can share a steak and a few appetizers and have PLENTY.  we took our whole dessert and some of our steak home and we are both big eaters.  ORDER THE CRAB COCKTAIL!",

Asked for a michelob ultra - sorry , we ran out ...on a tuesday ?!?!?   the restaurant is cool looking but i don't need our waiter to babble on about who designed it, how much was spent, blah blah blah   Let's focus on the food.   Started with the seafood tower - solid . Of course, the pretzel bread - still my fav pretzel bread though CUT gives Mastro's a run for the $$$.   I went for the meat - Bone in rib eye, some creamed spinach and asparagus. Of course, my fav, the blue cheese/oil oil and garlic sauce for the steak ( pic ) ...decent but not to the level of the mastro's in B. Hills and Costa Mesa . The rib eye was also average - the talk about the plate being 400 degrees when it's brought to you - i think they needed to add the 400 degrees to the broiler - i ordered medium but it was rare. more bothersome, it didn't have that nice outer sear bordering on crunch - it was too soft ! flavor was decent.   Some nice pinot noir wines - even though the host gave me the wine list to order, i showed restraint - a Laetitia from Paso Robles and a forgotten Oregon - both under $90 each",

Unfortunately with the rather loud \"Billy Joel wannabe\" pianist playing all night, and the shoppers strolling by looking at your dining selection, this place does not rate as well as it should.    While the service was outstanding, the quality was mediocre when comparing it to other similar, better located, places in Vegas.  Price hurts a little too...guess the uberMall rents are high so the costs need to be passed along to the diners.  Since service is one half of a successful dining experience, this is what saved it from garnering a single star.  If you are looking for convenience and staying at Aria or Vdara, you could try this place....or you could walk a little further to other higher end dining experiences.",

    "text": "I followed Peter H.'s advice and was so happy I did.  The seafood tower was amazing.  The tower can be any thing from the raw bar you'd like to create.  I let the waiter create it for us.  It included, Alaskan king crab legs, lobster, oyster, carved crab meat, jumbo shrimps....  They were all very fresh and cooked,except the oyster.    I had the lobsters bisque which was excellent.  The wedge salad was good but nothing special.  For the entree, I ordered rib eye steak, medium, with lobster mashed potatoes.  The rib eye was sooooo tender with great flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes was unique and best tasting mashed potatoes I've had.  There was a good amount of lobster meat inside.  I tried to taste my friend's prime rib, which was not as good as my rib eye.  I did not have a chance to taste the dessert since we were all so full.  I thought the setting in the terrace was a bit informal not compatible with the price charged for the dinner.  I'd definitely recommend sitting in the tree house.  The seafood tower cost more than  $200 by itself.  The rib eye steak was $52.  The mashed potatoes was $38, but a good amount was given.  If you plan on going, you should plan for $75 to $100 per person.  The service was a bit slow but very good attitude.  Oh, be prepared to pay to $2 tip to the restroom attendant each time you use it.",

My personal recommendation is don't order rack of lamb well done.  It comes out inedible as punishment for liking well done.  I have made and ate well done rack of lamb all over the world. Never has a restaurant cooked it in such a way that a knife could not cut it AT ALL.  Service was great though. My husbands steak just ok.  Butter cake was wonderful though.  We would not return.  Much much better restaurants in Vegas.",

I don't even usually like shrimp cocktail, but it is really exceptional at Mastro's.  The jumbo shrimp is delicious and the over the top \"smoking\" presentation is pretty amazing.    The steak is obviously great, but I could have eaten just sides all night.  The creamed spinach, mashed potatoes, and roasted Brussels sprouts were all delicious.  Since I was there with a big group we also sampled several desserts.  I know a steak meal can be filling, but try to save room.  Highlights included the chocolate pudding cake and the key lime pie.  A great restaurant for a special occasion.",

    "text": "A good friend of ours suggested Mastro's when we asked for a recommendation for a seafood on the Strip. So I made a reservation online for that night at 7pm on the Mastro's website. What I didn't know was that I had somehow clicked on the Chicago location. Luckily I was walking around the Crystals shopping center that afternoon and went to check out the venue and was chatting with one of the hostesses who offered to check on our reservation to confirm it .. good thing she did and we fixed my error. They were pretty booked that night but were able to squeeze us in. :)   The service was pretty much top-notch from start to finish, hostesses, servers, and bussers,  all were very attentive and knowledgeable as well as being friendly and personable. Loved that they dish out our sides for us .. that's a really nice touch.   The food, we had a variety of items which were all delicious but at the top of our favorites were the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi and the Signature Lobster Mashed Potatoes. Both are must haves to accompany any steak or seafood dish. We had the bone-in Filet which was melt-in-your-mouth delicious as well as the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass which my dining companions said was spectacularly prepared and seasoned.   Dessert was over the top .. we had three .. Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake,  the Cherry Crisp, and the Profiteroles. The first two were topped with Vanilla Bean Gelato. Both were to die for. I had read lots about the Warm Butter Cake and it was everything I had expected and more :) .. and surprisingly I also loved the Cherry Crisp .. I am not huge on Cherry anything but the flavor had just the right amount of sweetness and was not overpowering and the Crisp part is a crumbly granola like topping which is an nice balance with the Gelato and fruitiness of the dish. It's something I would definitely order again!   My only complaint is that the server didn't warn us about the size of the Beef Carpaccio appetizer. Mom and I each ordered our own, and when they came out .. they were absolutely gigantic and even though we had a party of 5 we were unable to finish both. Being in the service industry myself, I would have definitely warned my guests about the size of the Carpaccio dish and suggested something else to order with it.   All in all it was a fabulous dinner, the restaurant, even though it is in a busy mall .. has a nice ambiance, and we will absolutely be back.",

Bone in Ribeye,  Bone in Filet,  brussel sprouts, Scalloped Potatoes.  Butter cake dessert.  The usual Mastro's fantastic food.  PLUS seafood.     Burt ordered the twin lobster tails.  Cooked to perfection!  Not an easy thing to do.  Lobster usually is a little tough or well done.  This came out perfectly and cooked very slowly on the hot plate but never got over cooked.  Excellent service as usual.    Mastro's Ocean Club is located in the center of a mall.  That sounds horrible doesn't it?  But its not.  First off its a high end mall.  Burt requested to sit  in the Tree House, which is a modern type open style room that hangs out over the mall.  It was very comfortable.  A live band was playing in the lounge so being in the Birdhouse was a nice distance to hear the music and feel the energy but still be able to conversate(sic) with the people at your table.    Bottom Line-  Burt Loves This Place!!!!!!",

The apple martini comes out smoking, we also saw a Cosmo come out the same way.  A really cool touch!  We order an appetizer of shrimp cocktail, it come with three but since there were two of us Lionel ( our server) suggested we get four, so we did.  They were huge and very tastie.  The cocktail sauce was delicious along with some very hot horseradish, perfect balance.  We also ordered ahi tuna as an appetizer, this was amazing too.  Ordered salmon prepared blackened style and my husband order tuna Asian style with a side of asparagus.  We ordered way to much food as the portions are very generous.  We then had raspberries sorbet, which was to die for.   So, I mentioned large portions..we took home tuna, salmon and asparagus to our hotel room and ate a wonderful lunch in the room the next day.  They also boxed up the bread, which is a variety of sourdough, pretzel roll and something like a baguette.  Our lunch was just as good as our dinner.  I mentioned Lionel earlier in my post.  Well, you must request him as your server, he is personable and very professional at the same time.  Be sure to sit in the tree house.  It is expensive, but well worth the splurge!",

    "text": "Wow, what a huge disappointment!  I have always heard good things about this chain, including this location in Vegas.  This is a high-end (very pricey) steak joint, so you expect (a) a REALLY good steak and (b) prompt efficient service.  Ocean Club failed on both counts during our recent dinner.  Had we not been pressed for time, I definitely would have had a candid (blunt) discussion with the manager regarding our disappointment.  Our party of 12 was promptly seated and we had two waiters to handle the large party.   Failure #1 - drink orders were taken from the ladies and those came out quickly (within 5-10 minutes); they didn't take drink orders from the guys for another 5-10 minutes and we waited a good 15 minutes before they came out.  They messed up on two of the drink orders (stuff that shouldn't have been a mistake). Failure #2 - they screwed up on one of the steak orders (ordered rib-eye - I was sitting right next to him, so I knew that is what he ordered), they apologized profusely and said they would expedite the correct steak.  10 minutes later guess what comes out?  The WRONG steak again!  Fortunately most of the guys got larger steaks, so we shared so that our friend wouldn't be left eating alone. Failure #3 - I had ordered my steak medium rare, but it came out much closer to medium-well.  For a high-end steakhouse, this should never happen - steaks should come out consistent / match what the customer ordered.  The only positive note was the side dishes were all very good.  Other reviews are consistent on the rave reviews of the sides.  Given how much we spent on dinner, it was a massive disappointment.    8/31 Update - after posting my review, I did get a personal call from the GM of the restaurant.  He was very apologetic and I believe he was sincere in soliciting my feedback to ensure the risk of this happening to other patrons is minimized.  As a gesture of good faith, he did offer a gift card for use at any Mastro's location.  To be honest, had this call not happened, I would have never set foot in this restaurant chain again.  But, because of this gesture, we did go to the Beverly Hills location and had an AMAZING meal (I'll post a separate review for that location).",

Slightly poor ambiance because it's in a mall, albeit an ultra fancy mall. The piano guy was pretty good.   The food was fantastic. Had really good oysters, ask for the grassy ones if they have them. Some sort of california oyster that had a really strong flavor that the waitress recommended.   The crab cakes and ahi tuna apps were also very good.  For main we got the seabass and the swordfish. The seabass was very good, but not in that cliched and too common sweet glazed seabass/ black cod.   Swordfish I foolishly ordered a little underdone but was still good. They allow you to choose how to cook the meat, if you don't know much about cooking and different fish, ask the server, he/she seems very likely to know the best way to order each fish.   For dessert, we got their signature \"butter cake\" which was obviously ridiculously rich and good. Served with an ENORMOUS tray of whipped cream. Everything at this restaurant appears to be made from scratch, and it tastes that way too. Every dish is enormously portioned as well.",

Then when you all flip into action setting a table it is hysterical - too much commotion for other diners.  It was like Cirque de Soleil.  Shining flashlights on the glasses - meanwhile, i'm served my steak and NO ONE comes to ask if it is cooked correctly - it was not - it was mooing at me.  Anyway. won't be back and you'll be closed in a year.",

If you are not a steak person like me they have other substatutions for seafood chicken and salad. I had the chicken breast something and it was very juicy and tender and spiced seasoning. Was well worth it. Great for anniversary dinners or birthdays. They had a huge selection of desserts at the end of you meal but I would order for 2 the portions on some of the menu can feed about 2-3 people. The service was great as well.",

    "text": "Review for Restaurant Week Fall 2012 menu only:  I went to Mastros tonight for the first time and I convinced my wife to try Restaurant Week, too!  We were very pleased with the meal.  We got a nice bread basket with several types of bread.  I really liked the pretzel rolls with salt.  There were five choices in the basket.  Course 1:  We each got a salad--my wife's was a Caesar and mine was their spicy mambo salad.  They were both the same greens but my dressing was made with some wasabi, hence the spicy.  Both salads had a good amount of freshly grated cheese on them and they were very tasty.  Course 2:  I ordered the Scottish salmon and Andrea got the 8 ounce filet cooked medium.  I had several preparations from which to choose for the salmon and I chose the blackened option.  The salmon was delicious.  The filet was very good, too.    With their Restaurant Week menu, diners can choose two sides.  We each ordered garlic mashed potatoes.  My wife ordered the creamed spinach and I got the creamed corn.  The sides were huge.  Since we each ordered the mashed potatoes, we got a regular portion which is their standard size for sides.  The corn and spinach were smaller versions.  All three were very good.  I needed salt, but then anything needs salt.  Samantha started us out by giving each of us some of the sides so we each could try everything.  Course 3:  For dessert, Andrea got the chocolate layer cake and I got the Key lime pie.  ALong with the desserts, we were brought a large bowl of freshly made whopped cream--lightly sweetened.  The chocolate cake was huge.  My Key lime pie was more a normal size.  Both were outstanding!!  We ate in the Tree House overlooking the shops at Crystals.  Service was superb!  Our server, Samantha, was excellent.  The staff cleared tables promptly, cleaned the table cloth between (not that I'm a slob or anything), our iced teas were refilled often, and the pace of the meal was perfect!    I am so glad Mastros participated in Restaurant Week.  It gave me a chance to try it and I will be back.  What a fantastic start to RW Fall 2012.",

    "text": "Food was amazing. The discount on this review is based on the hostess service upon check in.   I wanted to have dinner with my dad for his 73rd birthday. I made a reservation for 5pm for a party of two. I showed up early at 4:20pm and hostess said she could not seat us however we can sit by the bar and have drinks and appetizers. The two hostesses asked for my name multiple times for the reservation. We sat by the bar and the bartender says only non cooked items are available for appetizers. I wish the hostess mentioned this before offering the bar side option. 5pm passes by and I see the hostess seating other parties to the tables. I went back to the reception and the same hostess asked for my name twice. She points at another host and I assume to follow her. She doesn't acknowledge or provide a greeting. I realize she is the one supposed to seat is. Maybe the host station wasn't organized or wasn't ready for the evening but I didn't appreciate the confusion and cold reception upon check in. I understand names are complicated but I must have said my generic name seven times to two different people, \"Cheryl Garcia\". To add additional confusion, I received an email saying I did a 'no show' for my reservation on Open Table. I'm not certain how that happened even when I checked in on Yelp as well.   The server provided better service and made excellent recommendations. I have an issue with over ordering but that's because I want to taste everything. For a party of two, I ended up ordering the chowder, calamari, sides of roasted brussels sprouts, sauted asparagus, twice baked potato, sea salt & vinegar fries, and twelve oz bone in filet. The bread service was warm with an assorted selection. I enjoyed all the sides except the twice baked potato- I thought it was too salty & the chowder was slightly watered down and boring. The calamari was flavorful and crispy. The bone in filet was served sizzling on a ceramic platter and was super tender cooked to perfection.   The server brought out a complimentary butter cake for my Dad's birthday. The cake was warm and rich topped with a vanilla bean ice cream and strawberries. This was very special and made the overall experience much better.",

He ordered the bone-in ribeye and I ordered the \"Chilean sea bass,\" which our waitress said was their most popular fish dish. The ribeye was great, flavorful, and juicy. Pretty in line with the quality of steak we've had in the past.   The sea bass, however, was an entirely different story. I am 99% sure we were served the wrong dish. I've had Chilean sea bass countless times, and my fish tasted nothing like it. The shape was long and narrow. The texture was extremely dry and almost chalky. I ordered it with the parm crust and literally the only thing that gave it flavor was the lemon I squeezed on it. The fish was extremely bland and it was actually hard to eat. I should have sent it back but didn't want to be that person. I'm not a picky eater, so this was particularly bad.  Even the bread didn't taste as piping hot and magical as the bread we're used to.   The service was fine though.   Absolutely the saddest dining experience during our Vegas trip ever.",

I appreciated the tap water so much more since I had been charged for a super-bougie bottle at Gordon Ramsay Steak.  The attentiveness of our waitress was exceptional. During the dinner rush, our meals got lost in the shuffle and when she realized we were still not served (bout an hour in), she made sure we wouldn't wait much longer. Our food was out  of the kitchen quite quick.  I started with the lobster bisque and it was incredible. Best lobster bisque I've ever had, hands down.  The steaks were very good. I'd say that they are much better than 95% of the steaks I've ever had.  I was divided on the sides. The sauteed broccoli was nothing special. It did a very good job of tasting like broccoli. However, the gnocchi was incredible. I could eat it all day, every day.  My sugar loving girlfriend was in love with the butter cake. It really was delicious, and that comes from someone who isn't into really into desserts.  Overall, not a bad experience. I'll definitely be up for a return.",

    "text": "We were in Vegas for a bachelorette party for one of my besties and decided on this place for our fancy dinner night. We had 11 girls and people ordered a variety of things from the sea bass to the bone-in steaks. This is one of those fancy places where you order just the protein and then sides are extra. Here's the breakdown:  Bread basket - GOOD. Normally, I'm not a fan of loading up on carbs, but we were getting bottle service the night and I was already starving, so I had to put something in the stomach. I was pleasantly surprised at the freshness of the bread! So soft and slightly warmed.  Lobster bisque - giant serving (probably enough for 2!). Rich and creamy with actual chunks of lobster!  Seabass - good and buttery. It was a big serving size and I only finished probably half of it.  Bone-in ribeye - good, but slightly under cooked according to my friend's order.  Lobster mashed potatoes - I'm not really a fan of mashed potatoes and these were okay. Small pieces of lobster mixed in.  Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries - pretty good! Nice little break between bites of our main courses.  Creamed corn - pretty good! Nice side dish without being overpowering.  The food was pretty good, but for a place of this caliber, I expected a lot more. They either under cooked or over cooked several steak orders, which had me thinking: What kind of steak house is this?!  The service was top notch at least and our bride-to-be got a special warm butter cake delivered to our table.  Would I return? Probably not.",

The ambiance is very elegant, and the staff Is on top of everything. I highly recommend this fine restaurant. I do highly advise the bill will not be cheap, but you pay for what you get.

I had the rack of lamb - very yummy, tender, not overcooked. Others had the petite filet, New York steak, regular filet, lemon sole, scallops, and roast chicken. The side dishes are huge, and can easily serve 4-6 people. (We had lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes, steamed broccoli, and 2 types of mushrooms.) The butter cake was so recommended, we had to get it. Hell yeah, as good as advertised! And the chocolate cake (can't remember what it was called - it's the more traditional one) was delicious as well. But one of my absolute favorites was the whipped cream that came with dessert. It could've been dessert in and of itself. Thick and rich. Was like eating sweet butter! We were eating it by the spoonful, it was so good. (I took some of the cake home, and ate it the next morning - the whipped cream was STILL fresh - not flattened! Now that's good whipped cream!). Great service and atmosphere.",

I decided to spend Valentine's day dinner here because oddly enough I live in Las Vegas and never been to one of my favorite hotel chains? What better else day to try it out right? Booked my reservation through <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fopentable.com&s=897c359bd752b4f5407d5ea86453c82be2d1913c8d0b51b18d81fc58f52a6497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">opentable.com</a> and actually because of the level of high priority reservations, I had to put down a credit card just to hold my spot. Reservation was for 9PM and once we arrived we were seated immediately which was great because I was starving! Things started off a bit rough for the experience but they made things right and THAT's the part that counts. I know what the quality of food should look and taste like because I dine at the one in Beverly Hills all the time. So for our order we went with the Tomhawk for 2 which was running for $115 and added on a lobster tail ($36) to go with it. The steak is obviously sharing size but the cool part is that they can cook it to the temperature of what each person would like. I am more of the medium and my partner is medium well. So when the steak came out it was incorrect and we asked to have blue cheese crust added which didn't get added and the mac n cheese came out sub par as well, very dry with just no taste! Not sure what the chef was thinking last night but anyways. The fact that I was able to pull the manager aside and address my concerns with the presentation of my meal left me satisfied because he actually cared and fixed it. I commend the him and the staff for going above and beyond to make things right. My Valentines Day meal will now be memorable! Shot Out To Dan! Thanks again!",

    "text": "I don't really know what to say about this review. It almost became a 2 star review but our server was knowledgeable, personable and friendly, it didn't seem fair.  Food is highly unimaginative. With this sort of price tag, you would think there'd be something special about the food.  There isn't.  The quality of the meats itself, was wonderful. Definitely have a good supplier and though, I didn't care for the flavors of the food, the fish, scallops and crab was fresh and didn't have a terrible ocean taste.  The execution is mediocre. Flavors were not complementary, almost overpowering. With fresh seafood, you should let it shine but I felt like an amateur who didn't understand the lightness of the seafood made our dishes.  We did receive a complimentary cheesecake because it was my bff's birthday.  With how much we paid and the overall taste and quality. Don't even bother coming here, there are too many good restaurants on the strip to settle for Mastro's.  You've been warned!",

    "text": "We ate at Mastro's at their Los Angeles location earlier this year. The steaks that we had were the best that we had ever had. We were in Las Vegas during part of the Labor Day Weekend and had long decided to eat at the Vegas location in a shopping mall leading into Aria Hotel/Casino and in a tree house. We were staying at The Cosmopolitan Hotel it was a breeze to get to the restaurant. We were seated immediately to our table as per our reservation. The server was very attentive and informative. I had a bone-in filet for dinner with garlic mashed potatoes and a dessert in the end. All of the above with a forever flowing bottle of red wine. The steaks at Mastro's Ocean Club (Whether in Los Angeles or in Las Vegas) are dry-aged and prepared to perfection. The texture is so soft and buttery with the flavors bold and bountiful. I have to tell you that the term, \"Melts in your mouth\", can literally be used at this establishment and it would not be over stated. We paid a pretty penny for this meal as well however it was well worth all of it and then some.",

    "text": "How can anyone not love this place?    Amidst Yelp's Spring Break festivities and other dining excursions we had in Vegas, the dining experience at MOC was one of the most memorable.   From the amazing \"eighth wonder of the world\" tree house we were sitting in, to a generous martini offering, to excellent overall service....it was beyond a five star experience. And I haven't even scratched the surface yet.     With all the eating going on in Vegas, I could have been very content with just their fresh pretzel rolls and a fantastic Campagna Burrata salad.   But I couldn't resist and...  ...order more pretzel rolls.  They were just too addicting. ...try their Brussel Sprouts.  Lightly salted to perfection. ...taste the Lobster Mashed Potatoes.  One order can feed an army.   ...sample their Petite Filet.  Medium rare truly melted in my mouth. ...and savor the Seared Sea Scallops.  Cooked just right with an orgasmic garlic butter sauce. (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-CAiZ_Gg3h21PwrANB4Q?select=krtNnXcIArthzdx-FQ1_RA#MwXtyVuKcCbgmgFiZySLuQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/GI-C...</a>)  Just when I thought it was over, I was reminded of their infamous Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  So I had to be a teamplayer and try a little.  It was heavenly.  No matter how full we were, dinner was not complete without indulging in this popular dessert...and the accompanying gigantic bowl of whip cream. I discovered that 10 spoonfuls is \"just a little taste\" when it comes to this cake topped with vanilla ice cream and sliced strawberries. Ay!   Their mysterious live piano artist kept us entertained and added a nice touch to the ambiance of not only the restaurant, but around all of Crystals mall.  This will not be the last time I dine here, that's for sure. Even though we were running late to a Yelp event, it was well worth it!",

Our bartender knew her sprits well and we did some taste testing.. And learned some things too.  The service was great. Everything we asked for was prompt and accurate.   Food was delish. Bone marrow apps.. Yum.  My steak was perfectly aged and well marbled.  Everyone at our table was praising me about my selection of this place!  The bill was reasonable. The extra bonus of course was that we were not treated like rubes the way Gordon Ramsay Steak does. It was so nice not hearing about the \"Hell's Kitchen special\" five time before you cane get a word in.",

    "text": "Yelpers enticed us here--and we are glad we came.  We started with the Dungeness Crab Cocktail. It was great, too tantalizing to wait and take a photo; we only could do so once we took a break. Delicious morsels of crab stacked in a bowl over dry-ice. The red cocktail sauce has some horseradish-but if you like it hot, ask for some on the side.  We planned to order one of the healthy vegetable side dishes but our waiter Jonathan (\"Johnny\") gave such a wonderful description of the lobster mashed potatoes that we couldn't resist.  Unless you're big eaters, the way to go is to split a steak. At the next table over it looked as though their steak was cut in half before cooking. But Jonathan suggested that he cut our bone-in Kansas City Strip into slices after cooking, served on a plate \"in the middle.\"  This was perfect.  Highly recommended. We couldn't even finish our halves of this delicious, well-cooked \"medium\" steak.  The mashed potatoes were just as described. Great. A big splurge, but this dish added to our memorable meal.  Too bad no \"desert pocket\" left for the longed for Butter cake.  Next time.  If you're looking for a place for one of those meals you savor not only at the time but also in your memory for a long time, excellent food served by a pro, Mastro's is your place and Jonathan, who's been here since they opened, is the waiter you want.",

Made reservations online indicating our celebration and when we arrived reception greeted my folks with a cheery \"happy birthday!\"   We ordered a bottle of Cabernet and a bottle of pelligrino to go along with our warm bread basket. Started with shared Caesar salad and ocean club salad which the kitchen split for us, that's always a nice gesture when a restaurant does this. I enjoyed the ocean club salad, fresh, with shrimp, chopped tomato, egg, and bacon. Salads were dressed just right. We ordered steaks all around except for my mom who ordered the Chilean sea bass along with fresh asparagus, sauteed mushrooms and scalloped potatoes. Entrees were cooked perfectly and delicious, I had a piece of mom's sea bass and it was to die for! Sides were good with the exception of the scalloped potatoes which were way too salty (maybe I shouldn't have said yes to add Gruyere cheese). The finale was Mastro's warm butter cake with vanilla ice cream with piping around the plate \"happy 80th birthday\" and coffees. Wow, cake was sumptuous and so very good!  Really a wonderful, leisurely evening bonding and reminiscing. Glad we chose Mastro's to celebrate a special event! A special thanks to our server, Tim who was so friendly and patient with us. He even walked with dad to show him where the men's room was. He's the best!",

This is our second time visiting this location, and both times we have left extremely happy and full.  The first visit we didn't make reservations, but they were able to accommodate since it was a Monday, this visit we made reservations, but it was on a Monday as well, so they weren't busy anyway.  The staff was very helpful and provided excellent service; never had to ask for our water to be refilled and were always attentive asking if we were doing okay.   Food: We started the meal off with escargot and bone marrow. Both items were very delicious. Mastro's is honestly the only restaurant where their marrow is enjoyable because it is cooked to the point where there is zero blood, I don't know if that is the correct way to cook marrow, but that's my personal preference. My boyfriend loves their escargot. It is cooked, buttered, and seasoned perfectly. As for our entree we shared their Colorado rack of lamb as well as their sauteed spinach. Both items were cooked excellent as well. To end the night we ordered their famous warm butter cake. In all honesty, their butter cake is the main reason we love Mastro's. There isn't anything like it. The warm, sweet, soft cake paired with the vanilla ice cream just go so well together.   Overall, we love Mastro's and anytime there is a location we are staying at, we make it a goal to check that location off the list. So far we have been to the Newport Beach and Beverly Hills location here in SoCal, and the location in Chicago. It is so good, how can you not!",

From the Main lobster tail that's always so juicy to the steaks, I've tried a few but recently my husband got the tomahawk steak, they cut like butter and is always cooked to perfection. The lobster mash potatoes are phenomenal not to mention the world famous butter cake. This location is a little bit brighter and more of an open space. I've been to one other location that had more of an dark intimate feel.",

    "text": "I have to say, the staff was absolutely fabulous! We came to mastro's at the last minute after having a terrible experience elsewhere. We had to salvage our anniversary dinner somehow and mastro's was able to squeeze us in on a busy vegas night. Not only did they listen to our story(which is another review entirely) but made up for it tenfold.   Our waitress was knowledgeable about the menu and the wine list, and helped us select the perfect dinner choices. I must say the gnocchi w snow crab and truffles was exceptional, literally the best I have ever tasted. We also ordered a pair of lobster tails that were also excellent. To our surprise they comped us their signature desert w a happy anniversary message written in chocolate across the plate. Everything we tasted was outstanding.  Again I have to thank the staff for a truly memorable experience. Every person from the busboys to the manager were very professional and treated us like regulars. I would give Mastro's my highest recommendation and encourage anyone to give them a try.",

    "text": "What's that expression that a lot of us foolhardy guys toss about as soon as we get to Vegas? \"Go big, or go home\"? It basically gives us a free pass to indulge in things that are extravagant, luxurious and potentially dangerous. And Mastro's fits well within this criteria: the place holds meals fit for royalty, the decor is immaculate, and it can be hazardous to your wallet's health if you are not prepared. But for those of us still reading, and certainly for those of us who have had the honor, Mastro's is a must-dine destination if you're in town.  Located pretty centrally in the City Center shopping district, it's almost impossible to miss Mastro's: the opulent, wood-like \"fishbowl\" perched precariously at an elevation is definitely eye-catching, and I'm pretty sure I inadvertently photobombed countless tourists as they stopped to take pictures of this structure, which is actually a dining room. Before you can get to your table, you stop by a tiny hostess desk flanked by two gals who wasted no time getting us seated once we checked in with our reservation. You'll more than likely walk past an offshoot to another, more private dining room, a pretty spectacular bar and then make your way into the main dining room that is expertly laid out: whoever did the layout here did so in such a way that seating is maximized but not once does it feel crowded. And this is even more impressive when you consider the polished staff is zipping about without hesitation or collision.  And let's talk about the staff, right quick: simply put, these are professionals who know their craft inside and out. Our waiter, Lionel, was the epitome of providing an exceptional customer service experience. We were -THAT- table that upfront told him we had a show to catch later that evening, and without missing a beat, he assured us he would keep us on schedule and would not let the meal be compromised. His service, along with the refills and bussing provided by other staff members, made for the best, most efficient dining experience I have seen yet in years of visiting Vegas. Add in a visit from a manager who just stopped by to chat and make sure everything was cool, and you have a place with a team that cannot be topped.  But all the friendliness and attention to detail means nothing if the food is bogus, and Mastro's has this base covered, too. Oh, do they ever. My folks started with a bowl of clam chowder and a caesar salad, while I went with the lobster bisque. All three were perfect pre-show snacks for the main courses, and just typing this sentence out is making me drool with fond remembrance. Ahem.   Mom went with a red snapper that was cooked to perfection and my surf-and-turf combo of a filet and lobster tail (which Lionel was gracious enough to de-shell table side like a boss) ranks among the best I've had at any place around the world. But the most surprising part was when Dad sheepishly admitted he had somehow never had sea bass before... and now that bar is set unfathomably high as his Chilean sea bass here was his favorite meal of this trip. A side of creamed corn and scalloped potatoes rounded out dinner, and wiped out my stomach. Somehow, my folks found room for Mastro's signature dessert, a butter cake that made me question how a chef can bake happiness, joy and euphoria into one pastry. It's that good (even though I had two bites and almost went into a coma with the straight gin I was drinking).  I cannot say enough positive things about Mastro's. From the staff to the overall \"look\" of the place, and most assuredly the culinary satisfaction each plate offers, it's a place that rewards all those who stop by for a drink or a bite to eat. Take those winnings from the casino and invest them here: I promise it's a much better deal than your favorite variation of Blackjack.",

    "text": "I first must preface this with the fact that I've eaten at numerous steakhouses in the city and also know how to cook - I can't say the same for the present chef here. First, this mastros is in a mall so I can expect that they are most likely hiring inferior kitchen staff. They also let some dude in with a tank top shirt on in the restaurant and you'd think theyd at least tell him to have more appropriate attire on. Also If you associate your name with being a top tier steakhouse and you completely and absolutely fuck up the steak it's very disappointing especially with the price point. Our server came over and asked to bring out our dinners early cause they were already prepared. Never ever heard this before from a superior steakhouse. The item was delivered no joke cold to the touch and completely raw when I cut it open. Completely raw. I ordered medium rare plus and any chef who is any bit noteworthy knows what the hell that means. More so who in the hell is checking to make sure the sous chefs are cooking everything right before sending out?! The head chef who has a damn temp stick. The only reason this got two stars is cause the management gentlemen was professional and realized the present chef is better off at Cheesecake Factory. It ruined our night out. Also to note the servers and bus boys are very good. I hope this review helps management figure out when you charge that much hire a chef who has experience.",

    "text": "At first glace, the menu, the photos on their website and on yelp all seemed very appealing; how could you not choose to come here after being exposed to all that? I was able to easily booked reservations with Mastro's OC the same day (on a Sunday) through yelp/open table.  After sealing the deal on this place, I had somewhat high expectations of what my experience and food was going to be like. Mastro's is located on the second floor of City Center and is surrounded by the endless amount of high end stores (Prada, Gucci, Jimmy Choo etc. etc.) so these visual cues added to my high expectations. My date and I were comfortably seated along their edge where we were able to gaze out into the nicely, holiday decorated city center as well as watch 90% of the people window shop...guess it's too expensive and not the right time of year to treat yourself to these classy brands?  Anyway, to get down to it, I was cool with the service and location but the food was OK; it wasn't to my liking and it wasn't to my disliking either.  My date ordered the bone in ribeye medium rare and it came to our table sizzling hot, at the right temperature (or so we thought) until he got down to the middle. It was not warm but not cold either...just this weird temperature that didn't seem right. At least we were able to get that replaced ASAP.   I decided to go with 2 lobster tails--I had one regularly prepared and one vanilla battered. I should have just  had it reguarly prepared because the battered one wasn't really anything special; I didn't even taste the vanilla...or perhaps there might have been a hint of it that my taste buds were unable to pick up on.   And the sides...geez, it was expensive and nothing extraordinary! I felt like I could have chosen the potatoes and mushrooms out myself and made the garlic mashed potatoes and sauteed mushrooms myself. Actually, I think I could actually do Mastro's up in these items (not saying I'm some kind of professional chef or anything like that, just emphasizing that these items were nothing impressive).   So after 2 ice teas, the 2 entrees and 2 sides the bill came up to about $160 without tip. I can't say the price and food quality ratio was appropriate, though again, the service was top notch. Oh and their artisan breads were delicious as well. I will also say I appreciated the follow up call they did with me the next day; I never had that happen and I thought that was nice of them to do. I guess I might come back here again but purchase something else that might tickle my fancy.",

    "text": "I had made reservations to celebrate my mother-in-laws birthday. We wanted it to be special and seeing 4.5 stars in Yelp, I figured I was sure to impress.   They did accommodate my request to sit in the tree house section of the restaurant, which I appreciated. Unfortunately, that's about all that went right for the evening. Our server was very aloof and completely inattentive. It felt as though we were bothering her by our existance.  We brought our drinks from the bar and were met by our server fairly promptly. After the perfunctory \"welcome to Mastros\" which seemed a strain for her to do, we didn't see our server for at least 20 Min's before she came back to check on us & take our order. She was very indifferent to our even being there, so much so, that I made the comment to my wife, that she was probably having a bad day.   Here's where the fun begins. After receiving our salads which were very good, the fire alarm in the entire mall and restaurant started going off. So here we are with bright lights flashing all around us and the blaring wooooop......wooooop of the alarm is drowning out the piano player while everyone of the staff is walking around as if nothing is going on. We are all looking at ourselves and asking each other, is this for real? should we be evacuating? What if there is a fire? Finally after a FULL 10 minutes of this, I ask another server passing by what was going on. She politely said \"ohhh it's probably just a door someone opened\" and went on her merry way\".   When our dinner arrived, our server never said a word about the incessant fire alarm blaring for the last 30 Min's. Not an \"I'm sorry about this\" or \"don't worry there is no emergency\", or we are working on shutting it off. No....Nothing at all. She just dropped off our food not to be seen again until I asked for the check. It was very bizarre   Now about the food. We all had some type of fish. Which was mostly good. I thought my dusted halibut was very bland. I only ate half of my serving even though I was rather Hungary. The Gorgonzola mac & cheese was very good. The asparagus was decent.   All told we finished up and even canceled the birthday desert  I reserved, because we couldn't stand the fire alarm any longer. The only thing our server said was, \" ohh your leaving,? yeah I guess the fire alarm is a bit annoying. Which is kind of like saying, \" yeah Vegas a bit warm in the summer\".   All told, the food was 3.5 stars and the service was 1 star. At least I impressed my mother-in-law with the Jersey Boys show right before dinner. Now that was 5 Stars!",

    "text": "I've dined at many a Mastro's, and I must admit: this location hooked me (and my rumbling stomach) + a pal for lunch because I found it architecturally intriguing.   The staff in the front of the house were still very wet behind the ears. I was asked, \"Is there any special occasion that you're celebrating? Anniversary, birthday...?\"   I replied that I am a living kidney donor and I celebrate that every day. My response didn't even register with the hostess and there wasn't any acknowledgment at all. *shrug* People have birthdays every year; it's not that often you have the privilege of donating a kidney. Just saying.   I'm a sucker for waitstaff in white jackets; there's something very genteel about it that I absolutely adore, though the ambiance was a bit odd - the skylights above took away some of the mystery and glamour that one might otherwise enjoy over dinner. All the better to admire the lines and the strange view that our perch afforded us.   Couldn't help but wonder: because the \"pod\" is not enclosed by walls, but mesmerizing woodwork that undulates and is breathtakingly organic... do shoppers at the nearby boutiques get distracted by the smells of the kitchen?   \"Yes, I'd like this limited edition Dior - hold up a minute - I need me a steak! \" Surf, turf and couture - pinch me, please, and pass the pretzel bread, I'm wearing a silk shift with an empire waist - Carbonanza!!!   The pretzel bread is otherworldly. I ignored the other varieties in the very generous bread basket, and asked for more pretzel bread, which was delivered warm, fluffy and perfectly salted. A healthy slathering of room-temperature butter didn't hurt, either. Even though I don't eat wheat, I was no match for the PB, and just surrendered to each bite of pillowy bliss.   My virgin strawberry martini was not as tasty as the high octane version (yes, I had a sippie and was glad I did) and was just too sweet for my palate - but I had to wash all that PRETZEL BREAD down with something, right?   Another quirk: there was a phantom lounge singer, who was, to be honest, not good at all... it was almost comical. It took me a while to figure out that it wasn't tongue-in-cheek lounge-lizardy - the dude was actually that schmaltzy. He was playing and singing live... but from an indeterminate location - I think it was behind the blue curtain - but it was just so odd, we kept laughing about it.   My crab cocktail was okay... it was fresh and bright, but the last 1/3rd was frozen, because of the ice bath in which it sat. To their credit, when I pointed that out, a fresh one was brought out.   The salads were nice. Nothing that knocked my Paul Smith espadrilles off, but I was very pleased that the greens were not drowning in dressing. Nice, simple, tasty.   I plan to go again, but will make a reservation for dinner; lighting makes a difference, but then again... Pretzel Bread tastes good at any hour!   BELIEVE.",

    "text": "Restaurant is built like a tree house in the middle of the shopping area in the Aria casino.   Very cool concept and views over looking the casino.  The hostess was very nice and recommended a table for us right by the window in the tree house.  The waiter was very polite and super friendly. Besides recommending some of the meals, he had some personal conversations with us and it turned out that he is not too far from where I live.   Now to the important part..... For appetizer we had escargot, which was really good.  For main entree we ordered a lobster special that was recommended by the waiter and the lamb chops.  Both entrees were very tasty and made just right.  Some of the best meals ive ever had.  For dessert we ordered cherry pie which was really good, but very large, we had maybe a 3rd between the 2 of us.  If you get dessert, i recommend you split it. As a matter of fact, both entrees were very generous sizes and we couldn't finish it all. I highly recommend this restaurant to everyone. The food, the service and the atmosphere are fantastic.",

The lounge act was a sexy male/female duo who played the piano and had a swanky voice. (Most are not this pleasing to the eye.) The appetizers we tasted were incredible, especially the calamari and grilled asparagus. I loved the flair our bartender used and hope he did not mind our flaky decision making skills. Can not wait to go back for a full meal.",

I like my steak medium rare, and medium rare is what they gave me. I ate my leftovers the next day, and it tasted just as deeeelicious. The lobster mashed potatoes is my favorite side, and the only one I will get next time. The other sides are pretty tasty, but not worth filling up on when you have a huge steak to consume. BUT you HAVE to make room for the butter cake!! The whip cream is made in house and it's worth every single calorie. 5 stars all around!!!",

Service was great, the room was perfect because we could be as loud as we wanted, and the food stole the show.   Must have....... would be their seafood platter. It's a 3 tier platter that comes with dry ice giving that smoky, cloudy look. It came with oysters, shrimp, king crab legs, and lobster over a bed of shaved ice.   The bone in rib eye, bone in Kansas city, and bone in fillet were all perfectly cooked and seasoned. Do not get the fish here. The sea bass was a little overcooked and dry. Then again, why the hell would you order fish at a steakhouse?   Lobster mashed potatoes was great but not when this cost more than the entrees. I was told that this dish was featured in Entourage and a few other magazines.   We celebrated 8 birthdays so the staff gave us 8 individual desserts which was very nice of them. Their butter cake was to die for. My God that was good. Their bread pudding and apple crisp were also very delicious.",

    "text": "If you're short on time and/or simply not a big fan of the written word, let me start this review with all you really need to know about Mastro's: BUTTER. CAKE.  That's it.  5 stars for the best cake I've ever had.  Ok, now on to the merely trifling details. I made a reservation several weeks in advance as my boyfriend and I were headed to Vegas on Labor Day weekend for his birthday.  I requested a table in the \"tree house\" (I called it the birdcage or something equally gauche) and noted the occasion.  We arrived and were told they were preparing \"one of the best tables\" in the birdcage--that we could sit at the bar for a few minutes or be seated promptly at another table.  Obviously we hit the bar which, it bears noting, is visually interesting with a HUGE inventory of top shelf liquors stacked all the way to the ceiling. I had the Mastro's Martini--Belvedere vodka with handstuffed blue cheese olives.  Sweet jesus.  Hands down, best martini I've ever had.  Three days later, I'm still thinking about those olives.  Didn't even finish my drink before the hostess, a sweet, bubbly thing, took us to our table.  Situated on the perimeter of the birdcage, it was a great table.  Yes, it's a mall, so our view included Louis Vuitton and a hoard of assholes who had just evidently exited the Elvis show but, whatever.  It's Vegas.  Plus, I liked the change-up from the normal casino venue which meant I got non-smoky air for a full 3 hours.  Our meal, start to finish, was fabulous, perhaps only outdone by the impeccably rendered service.  A special shout out goes to our main server, Matt, whose plesant demeanor, attentive service and knowledge of the menu (and wine list) were truly something special.  We started with a custom seafood tower.  Wanting to save room for the steak, we went modest with 3 shrimp (HUGE), an order of Dungeness crab cocktail (the best cold crab I've ever had) and 1/2 dozen Kumamoto oysters.  The dry ice effect and caper berry garnish were nice touches but the star of the tower was the hand grated horseradish.  When was the last time you noticed and RAVED about horseradish?  Yeah, that's what I thought.  I will never buy the jarred stuff again.  Moving on to the main attraction: I went with the 12 oz bone in-filet and boyfriend got the Kansas City.  We both preferred mine as it offered a better combination of buttery tenderness and intense meaty flavor.  He would do the ribeye if he had to do it over again but he was by no means dissatisfied with his steak. For sides we selected snap beas, glossed in simple butter, creamed corn ,which mercifully left large kernels of corn intact, and an order of the matchstick fries (sans vinegar).  Two TINY complaints: (1) Upon seating, we received the \"Reserve Wine List\" which the BF deemed VERY high priced--not a single bottle under $100.  A few things we could buy for $150 at the store were priced at $900 and up.  1000% = excessive mark-up.  Nevertheless, he picked a nice bottle of red that he thought was reasonable.  When the menu came, about 10 minutes later, the left hand side had an enormous list of wines of the style and prices ($100-200) you'd expect at a standard steakhouse.  Would have been nice to have seen that list when we were ordering.  Might have been an isolated timing thing but worth pointing out.  (2) Our first order of fries came out and were basically salt sticks.  And I LOVE me some salt.  I could barely eat these.  The manager came by and I made a casual comment about them.  He said he'd have the kitchen do a fresh batch but would leave us the salt bombs until the new batch was ready.  VERY nice touch, in my opinion.  Because of course we kept eating them.  Second batch was perfectly seasoned and the manager seemed to recognize that the kitchen can get a little heavy handed with them.  These two missteps in no way took away from how much we enjoyed our experience at Mastro's.  Last but NOT least (since it already got a plug at the outset of this review), Mastro's blew us away with the complimentary butter cake--served on a personalized plate (\"Happy Birthday Rob!\").  I've since seen some recipes for this cake and I'm really sorry I did.  I could hear my arteries clogging as I ate this, but man it was worth it.  One of those items where you take a bite, laugh at the insane delectability, take another bite, and chuckle some more.  For me, there is no better mark of good food than laughter.   I found the prices high, but totally on par for what I expected in Vegas.  And, in fact, to the dollar, the amount we spent on Nobu the night before (with cocktails but no wine). We'll definitely be coming back here.  And will hopefully be seated in Matt's section. Oh, and the table next to us (3 couples) spent most of the evening talking about bra sizes and dirty Sanchezes.  Can't beat that for entertainment.",

    "text": "While in Vegas for a friend's birthday, we decided to have a nice dinner and settled on steak. After reading about Mastro's, I made a reservation, and we were seated in the large wooden structure thing. Screw it, I'm just gonna go straight to the steak.  When our waiter mentioned that their special was an A5 grade 33oz. wagyu tomahawk, I was sold. It's basically a thick cut, bone-in ribeye, and I knew I was in for something special just by looking at it. The first thing that immediately caught my attention was the rim - it was HUMUNGADUNGA. Normally, the rim just encircles the outer edge of about half the eye, but this rim was almost the same size as the eye! Why is this such a big deal? Of all the steak cuts, the rim of the ribeye is the absolute BEST tasting piece in the entire beef carcass. I always separate it from the rest of the ribeye so I can save it for last. The muscle fibers in the rim are very loosely bound, and marbling of ribeyes is second to none. What this means is that you have a piece of meat that's super tender (just as tender as a filet), super juicy, and super flavorful, which perfectly describes the wagyu tomahawk. Each bite was a blast of rich and savory goodness. The juices coat your mouth in a sheen of happiness. There truly is nothing to criticize. The only thing I could wish for is that they serve just the rim as its own cut of steak.  The next time you're in Vegas, forget the crappy frozen king crab legs at the buffets, and treat yourself to something really worth the trip and big bucks.",

We shared the ribeye which was a bit dry but bloody if that can even happen. As a side we had the lobster mashed potatoes that had pieces of the lobster shell mixed in which brutalized my gums. We also had the sauteed asparagus that never made it to our table but we can only imagine what that would have tasted like.   As far as service our waiter was good and the team that assisted him was good as well. I was disappointed that I had to box my own food for the price I paid but hey it is what it is.",

We arrived to a bustling restaurant and were seated at the bar. The bar is quite impressive. We ordered cocktails and as soon as they were poured, the hostess came to seat us. Another host came with a tray to take our drinks so we wouldn't have to carry them. Very nice touch. We headed to the \"treehouse\" and were seated. We had a wonderful view of the entire treehouse. The bar drinks were outstanding. Our waitress was attentive and polite. We ordered an appetizer which was good. I ordered the Sea Bass while my husband decided on the petit filet. As we were ordering, our waitress overheard us say we would share and offered to have both entrees split. We also ordered the lobster mash potatoes. When our entrees arrived, they both melted in our mouths. The filet was so tender and the sea bass was light and flaky. After enjoying our dinner, we ordered the butter cake we had heard was so magnificent. Indeed, it was one of the most amazing things I have ever eaten. We WILL be back in April and we will be bringing friends. This was a real dining experience. My only regret was not trying it sooner.",

It didnt provide the same, dark, old school lounge feel that the Costa Mesa provides, but I enjoyed it anyways.   The service was excellent as always. Out server, Brandon i believe, was very attentive, professional and personable.   The food was as good as ever. Started off with the ahi appetizer. Followed that up with the wedge salad, which is one of my favorites. Then the 12oz filet with brussel sprouts and mushrooms. And then finished off the night with buttercake.

Almost all of this was achieved.  Except for the making Vegas our bitch part.  Vegas pimp slapped us all.  Hold me Vegas.    Mastro's capped the trip off.  We decided to take the Bachelor to a great meal.  Mastro's rolled out the red carpet.  Complete with private room with a view.  No dancing girls.  Otherwise, it would've been a 6-star performance.  Still, overall, one of the Top 5 meals of my life.  Including my hometown Atlanta, NYC, Chicago, LA, and elsewhere?    So what did I eat?  I know you're dying to know.  I had the Dungeness Crab Cocktail to start.  So they do this Dry Ice thing to add to the presentation.  It's cool and all.  I don't really need that stuff though.  The crab itself though?  Slap my mama good.  I remember one of my buddy's trying to grab a piece of grab and me trying to stab his hand with my fork.  Back off my crab homey or get a stump back.    The next thing ordered was the Bone In Ribeye.  If I'm going to eat at a very nice place, I'm probably getting a slab of red meat at some point.  This didn't disappoint either.  Literally melting in my mouth while having a perfect combination of seasoning and outer char.  My buddy asked this time and I still tried to stab his hand.    I'm not normally selfish about food I order, but when it tastes this good and all you got was Salmon and Creamed Spinach, you're simply not allowed to offer that for trade.  Idiot.    I am not kidding about this place though.  It really was that good.  I can't remember our server's name.  He was pretty good though.  Made sure to bring the bachelor some free stuff too.  Not too shabby.    It's probably an amazing place to bring a lady too.  Get the dungeness crab.  I'll be back.    Vegas.  Hold me.",

    "text": "This restaurant is superb! I've been wanting to check this place out for a while now and it just so happened one of my long time friends was planning on having her birthday dinner here. The ambiance of the restaurant is high class and lavish. Making a reservation is highly recommened, especially if you want to sit at a table in the tree house. In case you were wondering, the tree house is that giant structure across from Louis Vuitton. We had a 7pm reservation, but the birthday girl was running 10 min late. The hostesses and staff were more than accommodating and held our table. Once everyone was there we were seated right away. The waiter went over the menu and highlighted his favorites as well as what they are known for. I was torn between surf or turf, but luckily my date wanted the Chilean Sea Bass which I had my eye on, so I opted for the 18oz bone-in filet. I ordered mine rare of course because I feel anything above medium rare ruins the True flavor of the meat. The cool thing about how they serve their steak is they actually under cook it and serve it on a 400 degree plate which allows the steak to cook more to exactly how you ordered so it's absolutely perfect when you take your first bite. They age all their steaks for 3 weeks, and omg they are perfect. Juicy, full of flavor, and melt in you mouth like butter. Now for the fish, the sea bass was buttery, flakey, not too dry, not too wet, and just the right amount of oiliness. For sides, you order them seperately and they feed up to 5 which was perfect since there was so many of us. We all ordered different sides and got to share. We had brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, scalloped potatoes, sauteed mushrooms, and truffle fries. Oh my oh my, we were all beyond stuffed. Every element of the meal was perfect, but dessert was what sealed the deal. Two words, BUTTER CAKE. If you don't think it is one of the most amazing desserts to ever exist, you need to reevaluate your life choices. They also make their own whipped cream which is euphoric. If you're looking to have a memorable dinner you need to check out Mastro's, it's totally worth the money.",

I NEVER waste food.  I was concerned I would not be able to keep it down.  The Chilean Sea Bass (Endangered species) that my friend had was overpowered by contrived spices, sauces, and oils.

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came here with his parents and the first point I'll make to get your attention is that our bill came out $450. Now that i've got your attention.  Service: One word excellent. I'd like to start off by saying that I came here for my 21st birthday and you know how usually you'll mention it to restaurants in hopes of getting something free and they'll come out with some weak bite sized dessert. My boyfriend's parents were the one who mentioned it and I quickly got a happy birthday and I expected nothing of it after. But for dessert I actually got a full on, very generous portion of a piece of chocolate cake (with raspberries!). It had come while I was in the bathroom so I wasn't expecting the waiter to relight it again but he actually did! The waiters were very nice, they made jokes and conversation (not just about food but where we were from, etc) They really knew their stuff, like not just knew what the specials were but they were very knowledgeable about their menu.  Food: For starters we ordered escargot, chilled seafood, and crabcakes. The escargot was probably the disappointment of the evening. I've had much better elsewhere. There was just no taste or not a great taste. It wasn't gross or anything but I've just basically tasted better marinated or sauced escargot. For the chilled seafood, you're allowed to pick however many pieces you want and what seafood you want on it. It came in this platter that had dry ice in it. The shrimp were so plump and juicy. The crab was the best part though. I don't even know how to describe it but my boyfriend and I were fighting for the last pieces, just popping them into our mouths one by one.  -Rack of Lamb: So juicy! It was probably the best lamb I've ever had. The taste was there, it was perfectly cooked.   Dessert: We ordered their signature cake and it was very unique. I don't think I\"ve ever tasted anything like it but I wasn't raving about it as much as the rest of my table were. It tasted like butterscotch or toffee angel/sponge cake. I couldn't really put my foot on what it was, it was just so different.   Bathroom: This is actually the first bathroom I've been to where it had a bathroom attendant who handed you towels. They had tampons and other amenities on the counter. She opened and closed the door for me. It's too bad I didn't have my wallet to tip her but she was very nice.   View: Where we were seated, you could basically look out into the mall and people watch.   My boyfriend and I will definitely be back to this chain, maybe for an anniversary.",

The hostess pulling out your chair to seat you because your date clearly forgot that it was his job.  3. The server's extensive knowledge of the menu! She made it sound better than the menu itself. It's always nice when people convincingly show that they know what they're selling. Makes me have more faith in the restaurant.  4. Although it was inside a shopping center, you could easily overlook it due to the dimly lit dining space and romantic ambiance.  5. Calling you within days to make sure you had a great experience.  6. Servers scooping serving size portions onto your plate, so you won't have to, because eating is so damn labor intensive.  7. OH AND THE FOOD: - Bone-in filet was cooked to perfection and melt in your mouth. Order it rare or medium rare. - ORDER THE GNOCCHI. DO IT. Your tastebuds will thank you.  Two bone-in filets, a side of roasted brussel sprouts, and the gnocchi ran about $180 with tax and tip.",

We shared the Chopped salad. Yeah, you are thinking \"out of the colorful selection, really?\" But it was marvelous. So flavorful and fresh.   And then Rack of lamb medium rare followed. Ahhhh,,,,, it came on super hot plate the whole rack in one piece. We cut through the meat which was on rare side and finish cooking it on the hot plate. The result  flavor of the dish was beyond extraordinary. Best rack of lamb ever.  Atmosphere great, music decent, waiters nice and well knowledge  of menu and wine.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and my second experience was even better than the first.  My hubby and I came here to celebrate our anniversary and we were so glad we did.    We were greeted by the sweetest hostess as soon as we arrived, and she asked if we were here for a special occasion.  I let her know that it was our anniversary, and word traveled fast since our waiter greeted us with a congratulations.    I ordered the petite filet (8oz) and a side of Brussels sprouts, and my husband ordered the Bone-In Filet (12oz) and the Gorgonzola mac & cheese.  My steak was so tender that I could cut it with a butter knife and it practically melted in my mouth.  My husband is a steak connoisseur and he said that it was the best steak that he's ever had.  The Brussels sprouts were buttery and pan seared to perfection, and the mac & cheese was rich and heavy.  I'm not a fan of blue cheese at all but the Gorgonzola was really mild (I guess they use 4 kinds of cheeses).    Although we didn't even have room for dessert, our waiter brought us a nice piece of chocolate cake with \"Happy Anniversary\" on the plate.  Along with this came a giant serving of their homemade  whip cream.  I somehow found room in my belly and managed to scarf down 1/2 of it.  A really nice gesture that went a long way.    The service was fantastic.  Even if we looked in the waiter/servers' direction they would come over to see if we needed anything.    The only thing odd about this location is that it is in the Crystal Cove mall, so the ambiance isn't what I'm used to with this kind of food.  At least we were surrounded by high end shops like Jimmy Choo.  The bathrooms are also upstairs which are kind of a bummer.  We didn't mind at all though, we were on cloud 9 with everything else about the place.",

This new outpost of Mastros is romantic and elegant with all of the True hallmarks of five star dining.  We have previously been to Mastros in Beverly Hills and I much preferred this location as food and service were flawless as we've come to expect with the added touch of refinement and class that Mastro Beverly Hills seems to lack with the Nightclub atmosphere and Hollywood infused scene.   The Food:  Appetizer:  Seared Sea Scallops -  Perfectly seared and prepared in a Garlic cream sauce. Accompanied by 2 Garlic Toasted Bread Crisps. Delicous.  Entrees:  Petite Filet (Medium) - Hers - Simple but perfect. Mastro's signature entree and they do it to perfection  Rack Of Lamb (Medium Rare) - Mine -  I love Lamb above all other meats and this is one of the best I can ever remember having. Bold but not gamey it flavor. (Jiraffe in Santa Monica is a close 2nd.)  Sides:  Sauteed Mushrooms w/ Onions  - Sweet & earthy. The perfect compliment to tender Filet & Lamb when combined with Mastro's Fries.   Sea Salt Shoestring Fries (No Vinegar) - Crisp and salty which just the right amount of texture.  Dessert -   Chocolate Birthday Cake - Brought out complimetary. Nothing special but a nice birthday gesture.   Warm Butter Cake Ala Mode - You simply HAVE to get this!  No meal at Mastro's would be complete without it. My wife talked about this for days before our meal and reminisced about it for days after. It's simply the best enormous warm, buttery sugar cookie you've ever had paired with the smoothest vanilla bean ice cream you can imagine.   I have to say we left very impressed with our Mastro's Las Vegas experience. It definitely raises Mastro's to our favorite special occasion restaurant from now on (Just not the Beverly Hills location.)With food, service and atmosphere this wonderful you just can't go wrong.   Next up for us is Mastros in Thousand Oaks.",

    "text": "Oh boy, where do I start?  I made reservations for my fiance here last Saturday night :) It was his birthday, and so I wanted to take him out. We were in Vegas celebrating, and seeing that this place had high ratings, I took him here to try it out. The restaurant itself is inside a mall, and though we didn't get seated in the treehouse looking part, it was still a pleasant visit. It was our first time dining at ANY Mastro's restaurant, and definitely won't be our last! We got a waiter named Tim (Timothy), and he has got to be one of the best waiters we've ever had. He was very informative and was extremely nice. He showed us the different menus and helped us choose. I decided on the chilean sea bass. It was sooo good! The flavor was on point, and it was a perfect portion size. My fiance ordered the filet for himself, and his was overcooked, but they knew right away after he received it. Dan asked him if he wanted to switch it for a new one, but he said it was fine, and ate it anyways. He liked the flavor and was genuinely fine with it and didn't think it was really a big deal. We also ordered calamari as an appetizer, and a side of sweet potato fries. (Which was family sized, for sharing.. but we didn't know!) The calamari was awesome. We ended up only being able to eat about 10 fries out of that giant pile.. lol. We were too full! A different waiter served us sprite and ended up spilling it all over my fiance's shoulder.. yikes. They did help him clean it up though. In the end, my fiance got a warm butter cake as his birthday gift :D yay! It was so delicious, we ate it all.. despite the fact that we were super full! We were also given complementary wine for the steak being overcooked and for the sprite spill. Now THAT's excellent customer service, and if Vegas wasn't so far, I'd come back more often. I'll miss this place :( Hope the one in Newport is just as professional! But I know if we were in Vegas visiting, this spot will be one of the first places I'd go to eat at. Thanks for the wonderful experience Mastro's! :) Stay gold.",

I couldn't convince anyone to go to Cut nor Craftsteak, so we ended up at Mastro's.  This Mastro's is located in the City Center's shopping mall called Crystals.  Just look for the unique treehouse design.  We were lucky to get a table inside the treehouse.    I enjoy eating course meals and family style, so here's how we ordered:  appetizers: Escargot Colossal shrimp cocktail 2nd course: Seared Ahi tuna 2 Lobster bisques Main course: Bone-in ribeye Garlic mashed potatoes Creamed corn  We enjoyed most of our dishes except for the escargot and the seared ahi tuna.  Those two we wouldn't ever order again.  The lobster bisque and bone-in ribeye were the stars of the night.  There were 4 of us eating together and that was plenty of food.  We were so stuffed that we skipped the butter cake.  Service was friendly and our server staggered our meal perfectly.  Another excellent meal!",

Enter Mastro's, the ever popular chain of steaks that knows just how to let you indulge and live it large on a nice meal.  And as for pricing, it's actually pretty fair as you get a ton of great service, and most importantly, great food.    The steak would be the only thing I get to be a snob about.  For instance, the meat was a little tough and although they've caramelized it, I can't but imagine thinking of how similar it tastes to Ruth's Cris.  But luckily, the other sides gave it supreme justice.  I got the bone in rib eye, at medium rare, so it should have been tender, but somehow wasn't.  The flavor was just buttery and I just wish there was more.   Just to make things interesting, I turf'd it up with combination of jumbo shrimp scampi.  The amazing garlic sweltering sauce which had a parmesean bread crisp  reside next to made all the difference in the meal as the big shrimps were engulfed with flavor from the buttery garlic sauce.    For sides, we shared the following: -Roasted Brussel Sprouts - pretty basic, but satisfying -Cream of Spinach - so damn heavy and big its a good thing we only limited ourselves to 2 sides only on top of our surfs.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal, but would I come back?  Probably not, or to any of the other locations for that matter at the time being.",

Absolutely gorgeous design, impeccably-trained staff, delicious food and excellent booze selection make this establishment a winner.  Only issues are the mall location. Also, I made a reservation yet I was made to wait in the bar for 30 minutes, yet I noticed tourists in shorts with their Forever 21 bags sitting there eating dinner, they were obvious walk-ins so I wasn't pleased about waiting.  Bathroom is a hassle, requiring an elevator or flight of stairs.  But one of the best restaurants in Vegas.  Oh if you are expecting to eat cheap here, forget about it, you're looking at about 75 per person, without drinks.",

Since our server, Leonard, kindly allowed me to split a martini with my friend, I actually remember my second visit to Mastro's in its entirety: from the amazingly addictive pretzel rolls, to the heirloom tomato and Campagna burrata salad, to the filet mignon (served with Bearnaise sauce, upon request), to the lobster mashed potatoes--and, finally, the famed warm butter cake.  This cake, alone, is worth 5 stars! The warm butter cake portion was more than enough for the three of us, served with a drizzle of berry coulis, sliced strawberries, a scoop of vanilla ice cream melting on top, and, in a separate bowl, enough whipped cream to frost a double-layer cake.  My first spoonful filled my mouth with warm brown sugar-sweet goodness, with the cake texture somewhere between a Genoise and a pound cake. The cake was wonderful on its own but we couldn't help but top our tastes with the whipped cream. We were so full from our meals (most likely due to that extra order of pretzel rolls) that, sadly, we couldn't quite finish the warm butter cake.  I plan to return for an all-carb meal next time: pretzel rolls and warm butter cake!",

    "text": "I'm kind of surprised right now. So if you read my other reviews you pretty much know that it's hard to get 5 stars, but pretty easy to get 4 stars. If you get 3 stars then there must've been something wrong.  First of all I was really into going to eat here. I thought it was really nice on the inside. I had a very positive attitude without super high expectations. That's the ideal right?  Well, I was here for my wife's birthday, and my sister in laws belated birthday dinner. I ordered bone in rib eye. My wife ordered bone in filet w lobster tail on the side and my sister in law ordered lamb chops. I ordered mine medium rare. It came out just under well done. My wife ordered hers medium and it came out well done. My sister ordered hers medium and it came out rare. The manager happened to come by and ask how everything was. I really want to avoid complaining at a restaurant, but my wife said his is too done, and my sisters is not done enough. I said hey it's alright we can handle it, but the manager said oh no please let me take care of this. Ok I said no problem thank you so much. So they started another steak for me and started to cook my sisters more. Ok so they brought mine back. It looked right on the outside...nice looking. Alright so it was practically raw. My sisters comes back and it looks like they threw it in the microwave. All the while it's my wife's birthday and her steak is brown. Wtf.  So I cook a little around the house. Some say my steak is better than most restaurants. I usually say it's ok. Well, in this case I can say I can get the temp on the money 90% of the time without timing it. I really was kind of shocked. I won't go into the meat anymore because it really was a train wreck.  The appetizers were good. Dungeness crab cocktail, and oysters on a half shell. Drinks were great. We all enjoyed. But the dinner was really one of the worst I have ever had. I am really bummed about that. I can't really rate it a 1 star because the manager was good, appetizers were good, drinks were good, but the dinner...well, never again. I almost want to bump up the 2 stars that I have given on other reviews because this review is really 1 and a half.",

Mario, our server, was awesome. He hooked us up with a great wine and had some menu suggestions that would make anyones heart flutter. The bread basket was phenomenal and the staff we could see was very professional and classy. However, the staff we couldn't see undermined all forward progress made by the men in white suits. The steaks were overcooked, the scalloped potatoes were sour and cold, and the timing of the food was as coordinated as the Dallas Cowboys 2015 offensive line, or any play by the detroit lions since 1976. Its worth a try, but I would have rather gone somewhere else.",

I've always been a fan of Mastro's, especially the Beverly Hills location but I hadn't been to their Ocean Club before.  I decided to go with seafood since that seemed to be their specialty and I was really impressed.  The blue point oysters were extremely fresh and for the main course I ordered the scallops which were huge and cooked to perfection. For dessert I ordered Mastro's signature butter cake which is always good. Our waiter was very entertaining and the service was beyond exceptional.  The washroom attendant was very cheerful despite having to be in there on Thanksgiving day.  Thanks for the wonderful meal I will be returning very soon!",

Their service is probably as good as it gets. The hostesses are all very friendly in their greetings when you arrive. The wait staff is very attentive. I felt like I never had to flag someone down, there was always someone readily available.   The energy in the restaurant is very nice. There was live music being played on a piano which helped to set the tone. The restaurant itself is set up in a modern tree house space located inside of the Crystal's shopping center. There is nice colorful lighting that helps set off the dark woods of the tree house and white table cloths of Mastro's.  The food though is the real star of the show. I had the 12oz filet and it was phenomenal. It was cooked exactly the way I like it. Perfectly seasoned. The other member of my party had the bone in rib eye which was just massive. The sides we ordered were more than enough to share. The side portions are a meal in themselves. Their mac & cheese is a must have! So are their sea salt & vinegar fries. If possible, save room for dessert. Their signature butter cake is by far one of the best desserts that I have ever had on the Las Vegas strip. I was lucky enough to receive a complimentary cake from the manager, so if I could, they would get an extra bonus star just for that.  All in all, Mastro's is a definite must visit. It's great for special occasions or even business dinners. It will become one of your new standards for what you expect in a restaurant.",

I loved the live music that I could hear from the lower levels of the mall.  Service:  Mike R was our server.  He was completely patient and totally helpful.  He gave us a taste of two different wines when we were trying to decide on a bottle.  He was great with any questions we had.  Great guy and a huge asset to the restaurant.  Food:  The bread basket was amazing and beautifully presented.  Wish I could have tried everything without filling up before dinner!   Beef carpaccio, bone in filet, ribeye (bone in), au gratin potaotes, and compliementary butter cake (for our anniversary!).  I loved every bite of our meal.  The food was superb.  Drink:  As mentioned, Mike R let us sample the wines, and we selected the Earthquake, which he stated was from a boutique winery.  Huge thumbs up!!!!!  Next visit will include one of the cool looking cocktails!  This was a great, great meal!  Mastos hit everything on the mark, and have two satisfied customers who can't wait to return!",

    "text": "We walked by the place early last week while shopping and exploring the City Center.  Love the ambiance, menu looked great, have heard great things about other locations so we decided to make this our last nights meal in Vegas.  Glad we did because aside from Mix, and JR's this has now become one of our favorite places in Vegas. I would not hesitate to recommend.   Seated in the main dining area right in the middle of the coolest structure for a restaurant you will ever see. Warm dining room, very welcoming as were the staff. Ours were a attractive redhead young lady and a younger guy.  Piano playing jazzy christmas tunes, nice touch.  Immediate introduction by the servers, it looked as if there were two for every table. We started with the house special martinis, served chilled and shaken at the table and blended perfectly. Really, perfectly.  Scanned the menu,  server came back by to check on the drinks and announced the specials. Decided on the following:  Sauteed Sea Scallops Warm Spinach Salad Chilean Sea Bass NY Strip w/o bone Lobster Mashed   Scallops arrived, great presentation. Now I love scallops, being in the PNW we have lots of choices on seafood and some of the best scallops I have ever had are at the barking frog near the Woodinville winery and home of the famous Herbfarm. These were excellent, large but not too, perfectly seasoned and prepared. All sitting on tip of the most wonderful cheese bread cracker in a wonderful sauce. Yum!   Salad arrived, again great presentation, just made, plate warmed just enough you could smell all the ingredients. Now this was key. Onion, egg, bacon and greens all perfectly aligned to emit this wonderful fragrance that just made your mouth water.  None of the heat or tartness you sometimes get with places putting too much red vinegar on the greens.  And the taste, I shit you not this was the best salad I have ever tasted. The senses alive with the fragrance and the taste perfectly aligned.   Steak and bass arrived, simple but elegant in preso.  Bowl of steaming potatoes with over a pound of lobster and a beautiful sauce. Steak done to perfection, one of the best cuts and flavors I have had. And I am a steak house freak.  Steak was severed still sizzling on the plate, little bit of butter on top on a simple white plate.  Wife's Sea bass was served equally as elegant. Simply in presentation, nice cut of fish perfect flavor.    Service was just right, friendly, genuine there when needed. Asked the server to choose a wine for me to pair with the steak. Perfect choice came back again.  I don't work for this place, wish I owned stock or had ownership though. This was by far one of the best dining experiences we have had all year. We will be back.   Thanks to the wonderful staff and happy holidays!",

Everything was fantastic, and I went in with very high expectations.  A friend recommended, and said it was one of the best steaks in LV.  I was not disappointed. Steak had terrific flavor, and melted in your mouth.  Drinks, appetizers, main courses, sides, and desserts - all were simply fantastic.  We also loved the atmosphere, and our waiter was excellent.  We will certainly return.",

I went to Las Vegas and noticed they also had a Mastros so I naturally made sure I go. There is no way I could actually like Mastros any more than I already do right? Wrong! Mastros Ocean Club was even better than the high bar that the Chicago location set. Aside from world class food, Tanya and Juan, who waited on me, were the absolute best servers I have ever had. They know the restaurant food very well and its almost amazing how they know almost every ingredient used in every dish. They also gave me great recommendations for the rest of my time in Vegas and were just overall great servers. Not only does Mastros have some of the best quality food around, and the ambiance is second to none, but Tanya and Juan made it such a great time that I can not wait to see them again this upcoming February! No matter what you will love Mastros but if they are working, make sure you sit with Juan and Tanya for a truly exceptional dining experience!!!",

Not a huge deal, but definitely not ideal.   I had the mambo salad (spicy caesar salad with no croutons), 8 oz. Petite filet and cheese cake for dessert. The filet was perfectly prepared, served on a burning hot plate that sizzled and continued to cook the sides of creamed corn, spinach and garlic mashed potatoes. Our table also shared the steamed mussels appetizer, which was excellent! Highly recommended!",

    "text": "Mastro's is amazing. I had the best steak here (even though this restaurant heavily features seafood). We had an early reservation because we had an 8:30 show to go to. We were seated immediately and i think they gave us white or black napkins, which they placed across our laps for us, based on what color we were wearing. And that was just a hint of the level of service to come. We had a very attentive server, but someone in a suit, his supervisor (?) was also constantly checking on us. My water glass was never empty, a standard I use to base a restaurant's level of service. I had gotten up once to use the restroom and accidentally dropped my napkin. As I was leaning over to pick it up, our server appeared out of nowhere and immediately insisted that he would do it. When i came back a fresh napkin was folded at my seat. When the sides came, someone immediately offered to serve them to us. I was surprised no one offered to cut my steak...lol. The restaurant quickly filled up, but from the time that we were seated until we left, never once did the superb service lapse.  Ok onto the food: There were a few different types of bread and i think I like most of them. They refilled our bread basket, but I wish they didn't lol because I ate way too much bread. I ordered a berry flavored cocktail and it came in a martini glass, but they also set down a shaker cup by my glass, and to my delight, there was enough to fill my glass a second time! =D We ordered the steamed mussels appetizer and they were delicious, so fresh, not fishy at all. Just delicious. I could have inhaled an entire order myself. Everyone ordered the ribeye and it was perfect. So, so good. We were trying to be kinda healthy so we got sauteed mushrooms and spinach and creamed corn as sides. But afterwards I wish we had gotten the mac & cheese and the truffle gnocchi. Everything was so delicious and the portions were pretty big. I ate about a third of my ribeye and we didn't even finish all of the sides. Luckily our hotel room had a fridge so we could take the leftovers.   It was definitely pricey, but for the amazing service and food, I think it was well worth it. I would definitely go back or at least go to one of the SoCal locations. Mastro's is the standard by which I compare all steakhouses and other fine dining establishments to.",

The location (which is a huge factor with fine dining) is in the center of a high end indoor mall and it's loud.  Mastros can not control ambiance and echoing noise from the mall including the 80s hair band music that was playing throughout the mall.  I have been to Mastros in New Port and I should say the mood is very different there because they can control it.  So all in all.  Food Great...Service Great....Location Not Great.",

    "text": "There's a reason why Mastro's has such high reviews.  Good service and incredible food.  My experience was no different.  From the outside, the restaurant is housed in a cool modern treehouse.  On the inside, it's what you would expect from your typical fine-dining establishment.  The service here is attentive and accommodating.   They pay attention to detail by offering a black or white napkin depending on your attire.   The food?  Perhaps some of the best I've had in Las Vegas.  Let's start with the bread basket.  It was mixed with a variety of carb-loaded treats.  Olive focaccia, soft pretzel, etc.    We ordered the Spicy Mambo Salad and the Ocean Club House Salad for the table.  Both portions were very generous and each is enough for an individual meal.  Both were delicious but have their own individual personalities.  The Spicy Mambo Salad has no protein and is reminiscent of a caesar salad with hints of wasabi.  The Ocean Club House Salad had bits of lobster and shrimp and were well balanced.  We also order a side of macaroni and cheese for the table.  The \"side\" was huge and plenty for a table.  In fact, we had some left over for a party of seven.  Again, delicious.  For my entree, I had the 12 oz. filet.  I ordered it medium rare as I normally do.  It was cooked perfectly and was tender to the point that I could have peel off pieces with only my fork.  It's arguably the best steak I've ever had.  A friend order the sea bass, and unlike other fine-dining restaurants I've been to... the portion was huge.  The sea bass had a lightly seasoned crust and super white in color throughout.  It was flaky, yet melted in your mouth.  This was by far the best sea bass I've ever had.   The reasons I didn't give Mastro's five-stars?  Three reasons.  First, the waiter seemed to have a little attitude when one of our guests requested separate checks.  And second, they had a band playing there that night.  I'm not sure if this is a common nightly play.  But, I'd rather not listen to a 70's - 90's cover band while I eat a fine meal.  Lastly, I couldn't overcome the fact that every time I looked around... I was still in a retail shopping center.  I love views, but not that of shoppers walking in and out of Louis Vuitton, Prada, etc.",

My date had the pan sauteed scallops. She loved them and my taste was wonderful. She also had the lobster bisque. It was so rich and creamy.

    "text": "Mastro's really is as good as it gets.  They were so good, my bf and I came here twice during our three night excursion in Vegas.  The service here is impeccable, the food top notch and the ambiance exquisite and dramatic.    The first time we were served on by Tanya who delivered exemplary service all night.  We ordered the seafood tower with beluga caviar, lobster, raw oysters, crab and shrimp.  Everything was fresh and even tastier with the atomic horseradish condiment, red onions, parsley, egg white, egg yoke and capers.  If you like it hot, the horseradish here is simply the best.  It will give you an amp, clear your sinuses immediately and possibly cause you to shed a tear.  The escargot was soft and delectable with a garlic and buttery taste.  I can't pick out what herbs they put on them, but there was a greater complexity on the palette to make it more interesting.  We ordered a nice bottle of Cloudy Bay sauvignon blanc to compliment the seafood.  Dinner was so satisfying, we didn't have room for dessert, but we ended it with a couple of dirty martinis.  Unbeknownst to us, they also bring an entire shaker with the remnant vodka leftover!  Let's just say we left a little behind.  Unfortunately, a couple hours later my bf fell ill, but I didn't.  As always when ordering raw shellfish, it's always a possibility to get a bad oyster.  It was only disappointing to have to end the night so soon.  However, the way Mastro's handled it was outstanding.  We didn't have to call them to inform them how our dining experience went.  They called the next day to make sure it was good.  I ended up speaking to Sherry and told her about our wonderful experience minus the bad oyster.  She was extremely empathetic and invited us back in to make it right.  We gladly accepted the invitation and dined at Mastro's again a couple days later.  We were seated in the tree house again and Lionel waited on us this time.  He was every bit charming with a sense of humor and also delivered immaculate service.  We both had to use restraint  from devouring the fine variety of artisan breads in the basket.  We both shared the Tomahawk Kobe Beef bone-in ribeye medium rare.  All I can say is wow!  This was the best steak ever.  The softness of each morsel, darker color and bolder flavor was a real pleasure for us.  We ordered the escargot again and tried the roasted brussell sprouts and sauteed spinach- both cooked to perfection and tasty.  Lionel recommended a nice cab which I can't remember what- maybe Hill?  Nevertheless, it was a perfect compliment to our steak.  We ended the meal with a nice sponge cake dessert with fruit, whip cream and a couple ports.  Dinner at Mastro's in their architectural masterpiece called the \"tree house\" was the perfect last dinner in Vegas before going home.  Their appreciation for their customers and solicitous attitude really make this place top notch.  We definitely appreciated all they did to compensate for the bad oyster from the first visit on our second visit.  We had an amazing time and are sure to return next time we are in Vegas.   Thank you Mastro's for a wonderful dining experience!",

    "text": "I received a gift certificate for this restaurant for my birthday.  Having never heard of it, I looked it up and found out it was the treehouse-like restaurant in Crystals.  Now, interestingly, I have always wanted to eat there but I never knew what it was called or anything about it.   Having eaten there, I'm not sure why I've never heard anything about it.  I belong to a number of Las Vegas forums and Facebook pages and have never heard this place mentioned.  That's a mistake.  You can't mention all the fine dining seafood and steak restaurants and not have Mastro's on the list.    OK, so having read some Yelp reviews, my big takeaway was that portions were large.  My friend and I checked and splitting plates wouldn't be a problem.  We thought, \"Great!  We can split everything and use up the $110 and even if we go over a little bit, no big deal;\" we were quite certain we would get enough to eat.  Famous last words!  First up was a bread bowl.  OK, that's just evil right there.  Four different kinds of bread and you know you have to try one of each.  Just try not to finish any of them---more food is coming---more than you know.  We ordered a warm spinach salad.  They split that for us and we each had a normal sized salad in front of us.  Everything about this salad was delicious, including the bacon and cheese. The dressing was so good and there's still some bread so you know the bread went into the dressing because, well, sometimes you really can't get enough of a good thing.  For our entree, we split a 22oz bone in ribeye, creamed corn, steamed asparagus and steamed spinach.  When they brought the sizzling plate with the ribeye and put it front of me, I was quite sure they hadn't split it yet.  I was wrong and this big honkin' piece of meat was half!!!  It was cooked to perfection and still cooking on that plate.  So, here's the problem, we ate the meat.  I don't know where my stomach found room but that wasn't going to waste.  Sadly, after we had our first portions of vegetables, whatever vegetables were left in their bowls didn't make it to our plates.  We were so completely stuffed.  But, wait, it was our birthdays (4/7 and 4/21) so we celebrated with warm butter cake.  OK, that's just wrong, on so many levels.  I thought the bread was evil but the butter cake Is the devil incarnate.  Oh, we're not done yet.  Here comes a bowl of  home made whipped cream for the cake.  The bowl was so big, you could have taken a bath in it.    My friend and I agreed we are going back to this restaurant but we are bringing other people with us because, honestly, three or four people would have been very well fed on all this food.  The decor, atmosphere, and service (Gino, you are the best!!!) pushes this restaurant over the top.  They have many peers but none better!",

It's definitely on the pricey side, but well worth it if you're looking for something nice. It can be the small things that make or break an establishment-in this case it's the ability to get \"half\" orders of their salads and side orders. Nice touch. I highly recommend giving Mastro's a try. Because it's in the middle of an indoor shopping mall, it's a little bit of a stretch to say it's super romantic or intimate. But, it's easy to tune all of that out and just focus on your food and company. I hardly ever give 5 star reviews, but I think this place has earned it.",

    "text": "One of the many indulgences of La Vegas. Mastro's is a well known stop for those looking to treat themselves.  Food: We went as a group of 7 girls and all got steak with a variety of shared sides. I split a 16oz filet made medium (almost half the price it would cost to get an 8 oz filet on your own). It was everything I expected from a good steakhouse, well seasoned, tender, and perfectly cooked. Its only dressing was a melting slice of butter on the top. The sides were all generally well made. The lobster mashed potatoes had real chunks of lobster it in, though, between the 7 of us, not everyone got a piece. The brussel sprouts and asparagus were cooked to just the right texture but there was nothing really special about them. The creamed corn was sweet and luxuriously smooth but needed a little more savory to balance it out.  Service: The service was excellent. The server was very accommodating and attentive. A few of us ordered steaks to split and they plated them separately for us. We also brought in our own cake since we were celebrating a birthday. They served the caked and repacked the leftover cake for us to go.  Locations: Mastro's unique architecture has made it a near icon among the casinos on the strip. Floating in the middle of Crystals, it makes up a beautiful view and provides one. The decor is subdued in an elegant way and it generally draws a quieter crowd.     While Mastro's wasn't a life changing dining experience, between the high class menu and eye catching locale, it certainly did not disappoint.",

    "text": "What a wonderful evening! When I initially called to make the reservation I had a warm welcoming voice on the other end.   Upon arriving I was a little unsure because I didn't realize it was inside the mall, I immediately didn't know what to expect. I have been to the one in Newport Beach, Scottsdale and Palm Springs, all fabulous of coarse.   Hostess looked well groomed, acted professional and was very inviting and seemed happy to have us dine.   Server Lionel was Amazing, Made great dinner suggestions. I had the Strawberry Mule to drink, Bone In Filet for dinner, My husband had the Lobster and we shared scallop potaoes and sauted asparagus. ( All sides are ala carte and are shareable for the table)   Only downfall was there was a problem with the scallop potatoes, within seconds a manager by the name of Brandon was there, took it away and offered garlic mash potatoes in place , until new ones were ready. Nice recovery, and made the situation forgotten. When the new ones came it was PERFECT!  At the end of our meal our server Lionel and Manager Brandon came by again and apologized for the mishap and brought us a complimentary dessert which is there signature dessert, The Warm Butter Cake. All I can say is OMG!!! Best thing ever.   It was a beautiful experience, Great food, service and atmosphere. Food was spaced out and timed perfectly. Excellent job chefs! I am defiantly going back next time we go to LV.   A restaurant that runs this smoothly from back of the house to front is all from great leadership. Kudos to whoever is in charge, keep it up because your doing it right!  Visited January 2016",

I feel like usually when I leave a review its because I'm unhappy with the place but that's NOT at all how we felt last night at Mastro's.. Down to every detail the experience and the night was amazing. Our server Paul gave us the best costumer service we had ever experienced. He was friendly.. Made jokes and even custom tailored our menus to our liking.  I started off with a cocktail that Paul personally had made for me based off my preference for something sweet and tropical, yet strong. My fiance had a beer found only at Mastro's. For appetizer we both had shared the shrimp cocktail. The shrimps were jumbo sized and so fresh it's as if they had just got it from the ocean!   For our entrees my fiance had the rib eye and I had the 3lbs Maine lobster. Our server brought out the food and de shelled the lobster in front of me. He even cut up my steak in front of me. Talk about excellent service! The food was so flavorful.. fresh and the service was impeccable! I definitely would recommend this place.. And ask for Paul to be your server!",

    "text": "Mastro's Ocean Club is a fine dining establishment located in the Aria Hotel and Casino. The ambiance is set well, the architecture is particularly astounding, and the service is exquisite. Our server, Joe, was on his game. My water glass and wine glass never reached half empty (or half full). Ordered the Bone Marrow, Lobster Bisque, Ocean Club Crab Cakes, Sauteed Broccoli, Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese, 22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye, and Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.   Bone Marrow - Holy Donkey Punching Jesus this is astounding. I have never had Bone Marrow before but its alluring presence on the menu was enough for me to sample it. The Bone Marrow comes half charred on a split bone with a serving of toasted baguette to spread on. The flavor, the texture, the taste and everything about it was amazing. I will order this every time and you should as well.  Ocean Club Crab Cakes - Hearty crab cakes with more crab than cake. In fact the cakes fall apart to the softest touch, the chunks of crab meat separating with ease as only a minimal amount of filler has been used. Flavor and spice is more than enough to accent the cakes.  Lobster Bisque - Oftentimes Lobster Bisque comes heavily buttered, even in the most finest of dining establishment. Butter is an easy thing to add to a dish to increase its flavor without actually improving on its originality and substance. However, Mastro's Lobster Bisque does not perpetuate this and, rather, has a full-bodied bisque with a generous portion of lobster inside. The thickness is akin to how a bisque should be.  Sauteed Broccoli - Opting to go a slightly healthier route with one of the dishes I was still impressed but of course, it's sauteed broccoli, and only so much can be done while keeping it True.  Gorgonzola Mac and Cheese - a perfect compliment to my Bone-in Ribeye and a hearty side at that. It's a shame our hotel fridge has a monitored scale with a restocking fee otherwise I would have had no issue taking the remainder of this with me.  22 oz. Bone-in Ribeye - One of the finer Ribeyes I have had. A generous amount of fat and it was seared and salted well enough to make it exceedingly juicy. Cooked to perfection (rare) with a cool red center while the black crust of searing on iron was still present.   Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake - Fuck. That's Amazing.  The servings sizes of sides are plentiful and the prices are what you'd expect at such an establishment. Be wary of those giving Mastro's a bad review due to price or service, such an establishment would be careful to hire only proven servers and I would wager that the reviewers themselves to be the standoffish party.",

And keep in mind I'm not asking for you guys to bend over backwards to keep us happy, but the attitude needs a lot of improvement from the host to the server.   I didn't keep that in mind for long because we were here for the food anyway and I thought the food will make up for it. We order the hamachi appetizer, which was the only decent tasting dish. We ordered the sea bass, rack of lamb and scallop. They were all just super basic dishes. It was literally just a protein with no sauce whatsoever! I could have done this at home and this would have tasted better at a local BJs. I expected much better from you guys.   Then when we were about to leave I asked for a box so I could take the bread to go so that we could snack on it later. I got attitude and was asked twice am I sure I did not want to take the courses to go. There's a reason why we didn't ask for box to go and we obviously thought it was NOT good enough to take it to go, and I understand why our server gave us attitude. He thought we were wasteful, but the food sucked so just leave us alone and don't ask twice with an attitude.   I would skipped this place if you're in Vegas, you can find much better places to eat around here. I understand sometimes it sucks to be working on a holiday or the weekend, but keep in mind we all work too and we spend good money to have a good meal out here too. We don't deserve any of this nasty attitude or food.",

Started with two delicious crab cakes, followed by halves of a Ceasar and wedge salads.  Then came the filet mignon, gorgonzola mac n cheese, and lobster mash potatoes.  We were stuffed but of course had to try their famous butter cake and we were so glad we did!  The filets were a tad more rare than we like but we're still great and my fiance said the lemon drops, Mac n cheese, and the butter cake were the best dishes she's ever eaten! That says a lot since we frequent places like Gordon Ramsey's Steakhouse, PRIME st Bellagio, N9NE at Palms, SW at Wynn, to name a few for special occasions.   It's a great place and we will absolutely return!",

The food and drinks were fantastic, the atmosphere wonderful and our server Sam (Samantha) was absolutely made our dining experience one to remember....in fact, we went back just this past weekend for my husband's birthday....and Sam greeted us, welcomed us back although she wasn't our server, she was checking that our dining experience was good. Nice touch, for a server to remember a couple in the midst of the hundreds that she assists (that's attention to detail if you ask me).   Our first visit we enjoyed their delicious bread basket (pretzel bread my fav), Lobster Bisque (dare I say, the best ever tasted...and that's coming from someone that grew up in Monterey with some of the best seafood anywhere), lamb (again, the best ever tasted), filet, sauteed green beans....and topped off with their signature warm butter cake! And can't forget the smoothest and delicious Lemon Drop cocktail....love the dry ice effect!   We had another fabulous dining experience that evening for my husband's birthday just this past weekend with Craig as our server. This time we started we took it lighter and slower to enjoy.....starting with their spinach salad and decided to split the 22oz Ribeye that I had read about and recommended...they kindly split it up on 2 separate plates for us (without us asking), sauteed asparagus.....and was topped off with a birthday creme brulee (my hubby's fav dessert)....I wasn't much of a brulee fan....until I tried theirs....smooth, creamy, delicious vanilla bean custard!  We won't miss a visit on our future Vegas visits...even if just to sit at the bar for appetizers, bisque, drinks and dessert!",

Moved on to the mixed greens salad and the vegetables weren't too fresh and the salad and plate both had some fridge taste...  Moved on to the Lobster Roll and again, it was pre-made, wasn't fresh, and had too much rice.  The seared ahi tuna came out really dark...didn't seem fresh.  My 8 oz Petite Filet was requested medium rare and came out as such. The meat had a strong flavor and was slightly salty...nothing spectacular here.  The sauteed mushrooms, creamed corn, and garlic mashed potatoes were all mediocre.  Service was okay. The wait staff slammed the dishes on the table and quickly split our side dishes...it was pretty rushed.  ...the tap water had a strong chlorine smell...gross.",

It's located inside the crystal shopping center. Literally looks like the Starbucks located across from the restaurant. The food was not great. The service was ok and the drinks were filled with cheap vodka. It was basically eating at sizzer",

    "text": "My lovely girlfriend took me here for my birthday. Being a non-practicing Hindu, I hold a special love for a medium-rare steak. Our reservation was for 7:30PM and once we got there we were escorted to our table and seated promptly. It's a very busy place; so do reserve a table ahead of time.  Our server was very nice and professional. We ordered soups for starters, my girlfriend ordered clam chowder and I ordered the lobster bisque, both soups were delicious, especially the lobster bisque. Lobster bisque was cream and not too sweet and as an added bonus there were big piece of delicious lobster meat.   After we were done with both soups we both ordered filet mignon. I went with 12 OZ. medium rare cut while my girlfriend went with 8 OZ. well done cut (sacrilege!!!). We also ordered creamed spinach, baked potatoes with cheese and sauteed asparagus. After a 20-25 minute wait we were served our delicious meal. The steak was exquisite, the seasoning was perfect and the meat was like butter. It melted in our mouth. The sides were also delicious, creamed spinach in particular complimented the steak well.  The only complaint of mine was that the baked potato had too much cheese on it, but everything else was amazing.   I think this is best steak house I've been to in Las Vegas and if you are on the strip, then this is the place to go.",

What people who visit Vegas don't know is, our little West Side has eats as good as anything you will find on the World Famous Las Vegas Strip.  However, for special occasions, we still venture down to the zoo.  On this occasion, for our 9th anniversary we settled on Mastro's after hearing nothing but amazing things. Welp. In fact they are all True. We were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food product, and the attention to detail.  Yes. It was an expensive dinner. But man, does this staff and Chef crew nail it. From the soft breads offered, to the Caesar salad, to the lobster mashed potatoes. Yes. Lobster.  The star of the evening beyond the waitstaff who I can't say enough about, was the medium rare Rib-eye with truffle butter cooked to literal perfection. I have eaten many steaks, all over the world. This was simply one of the finest I have ever had the pleasure of tasting.  Well done Mastro's. Well done.",

Imo, it's as good as Ruth Chris (but not as good as Fleming's). The potatoes were ok (but my wife makes WAY better). The desert there is friggin ridiculous! It's this huge butter cake and it's awesome! So get that and save room for it! Actually, maybe skip the steak and just get that! That's the only thing I would come back here for. The atmosphere sucks because you're in the middle of a mall. It's not really romantic or classy - more like food-courty... Service is good. The waiters were a little bit formal for my taste, but it's kind of that type of place.",

If you haven't tried it and you are on death row, this should be your final meal (for dessert). If you are not on death row or in prison, you should definitely make a trip and try it out. The rest of their food is really good as well, but we came for THE dessert.   I can't describe it, except it is scrumtralecent. I envy anyone who lives within an hour of Mastro's.

Located in the shops at Crystals which in itself is a gorgeous mall, this beautiful wood structure houses The Ocean Club Mastro's in Las Vegas. And as usual the food is always amazing here. My go to favorites have always been the bone in ribeye, the cream corn and the always delicious pretzel bread. And to top it off the always delicious butter cake.... the best dessert I've ever had in my life!

I had the Sea Bass and felt as though it was pretty dry and maybe over cooked.  The appetizers / sides were all good, but the highlight for me was the dessert.  I had the vanilla cake, and it was outrageously good.  It was like a chocolate lava cake, but vanilla.  I never had anything like that before, and it was great.  If the main dish was better, Mastro's would be a 4 star meal.  The prices were what one would expect.  By no means is it a cheap meal, but it was \"A-OK\" (for the price).  This has to be rated based on cost / enjoyment.",

The intimate setting and fancy atmosphere made me expect a very large bill but the prices are very reasonable for the amount of luxury, excellent service, food quality, and professionalism.  Piotr was our waiter but it felt like the entire restaurant's staff was at our finger tips. We never felt like we needed to wait and it really felt like we were special guests at this establishment. I would highly recommend this place no matter your group size! I felt like they could handle anything we threw at them.  The food was amazing and all the meats just melted as we ate them. The portion sizes available were very appreciated since the group had various (stomach) sized people. Cooked to culinary perfection, we had a meal to remember for the rest of our lives.

Hahaha, my boyfriend made reservation for my birthday dinner on a Sunday night this was last minute because we wanted to stay in Vegas longer hahaha , we usually go to the one in Orange County because we are from California.   OH wow this Mastros is GORGEOUS! Make sure to ask for a seat in the bird-nest!!   Food - BEST BEST BEST Lamb racks ever!!! Ugh I had it medium rare but it came out more rare but I didn't mind. Ever bite taste like butter. Boy friend has the New York Steak - This wasn't so bad, I couldn't stop thinking about how good my lamb racks were that I can't remember if this was super good or not hahaha. We had a side of Mac and Cheese too greasy, would not order this I think we prefer the Lobster Mash potatoes instead.   Service was wonderful! Better service than we had in Orange County. Everyone was nice, and even the manager came to ask if everything was fine.   In the end of the meal our server ask if we wanted any dessert but we were super full for any. But he still came out and surprise me with a birthday cake! He even wrote \" Happy 21st birthday. \" Which I think is very special to me!    THANK YOU MASTRO'S LAS VEGAS!",

The restaurant was beautifully organized and last but not least the food, I have to say, is the best I've had at any mastros.

But we made it and we made reservations in advance so no problems with our table.   Once placed at a table I think the floormanager thought it took too long before we got menu's and drinks because after some talking in a little microphone he brought the menu's himself. And bizarre: he really, really resembles Sheldon Cooper (Big Bang Theory). And once you've seen it........  Our waiter showed up explaining the menu and taking the drink orders. To be honoust, we've missed most of the information. A high speed talk with way too much information about the specials.  We decided on half a portion of the salad of the day (spinach, bacon, egg, the promised blue cheese was hard to find), the lobster bisque, a Ahi Tuna Tartare and the Ribeye with bone. For sides just the sauteed mushrooms.  Portions are huge, but had a few dissapointments considering the price. Although we'resure the waitress spoke off different kinds of Preparing the meat (grilled, blackend, etc.) she didn't asked we would like the meat prepared. Looking at the meat of our neigbours we asked which cooking that was. Turned out to be rare. Just a little too pink for us so we asked the meat to be cooked medium. Can tell you, what we got was definitely way beyond medium. Almost welldone. And no,we didn't send it back. I know, we should have.  The mushrooms were perfectly cooked and huge. Like the portion. More than enough to satisfy four. The bisque was oke but both appetizers, the spinach salad and Ahi Tuna Tartare were flat. The salad being nothing special and the Tuna was way to cold  discover any taste at all. I also don't understand the fried things (onions?) on the bottom.  Best experiences were the setting, despite the location, the services and the bread. Especially the latter was excellent.   Together with a glass of white and red we've paid $163 before tip.  NOTE: excuse any grammar and spelling mistakes. I'm no native speaker and keep having troubles with my Apple device that keeps trying to change the English words into proper Dutch words. Yes, you've guessed right. My first language.",

The food was good but nothing that made me say wow, i need to come back and eat this again. I had the miso cod and escargot.  Both good but not memorable. What was memorable was the ambiance. It was romantic yet there were large groups around that worked well too. There was a piano man right next to the bar area that took requests all night. We even stayed and hung out bar side because he was so good! When dining make sure to request to sit IN the treehouse, if not there's not too much of a wow factor in your experience.",

Although I never tried the food here, I have to give this place 5 stars (would give it more if I could) for one reason: the bartenter Victor.  Victor isn't just one of the finest mixologists whose creations I have had the joy of imbibing.....he is truly an artist.  I tried the Boulevardier (which was the most well-balanced Boulevardier I have ever tried - it was actually a little bit mind-blowing.  I am good friends with one of L.A.'s top bartenders and he says the Boulevardier is one of the trickiest drinks to balance) and something called the \"Faux-jito\" which was also amazing.  I asked Victor to make me one of his original inventions, and I sadly forget the name of the drink, but it was a unique and sensational libation as well.  Next time I visit Las Vegas, I hope to find Victor again and enjoy the best cocktails in Las Vegas!",

I went here first with my girlfriend for an anniversary and also with my family for New Years. I recommend their fish since they are known for their seafood here. The service is top notch and be sure to tell them if you came for an anniversary since they usually hook you up with some sort of dessert! If you like alcohol with your meal I definitely recommend their lemon drops. It was so amazing I asked the waiter how they make it and they told me they soak their vodka with lemons for a long period of time to get the flavor. It tastes so delicious I could barely tell there was any alcohol in it but I felt it hit me after a glass. One of the best drinks I have ever tried. Be sure to make a reservation as well. I never had too much trouble making one and they did seat me earlier since we got there 20 minutes early but it always seems quite packed. This restaurant would definitely make my top 5 of the best restaurants I have gone to in terms of service and food quality.",

    "text": "Our reservations were for 10:30 pm (Valentine's Day), but we arrived a little after 10:00 and were quickly seated in the \"tree house\", which is more like a bird cage!  Our waitress (Tanya) was phenomenal the entire evening.  She catered to every need and offered excellent suggestions during ordering.    We began with a few cocktails, which were very tasty.  My wife and I decided to split a bowl of Lobster bisque, since I had read reviews that it was very good (I had Lobster  bisque the previous evening at a Venitian restaurant, and was very disappointed).  This bisque was the best I have ever had!  It was a quite large serving with many sizeable pieces of lobster.  It could easily satisfy as a meal by itself!  As a main course, we split the Chilean Sea Bass ($50, I think).  When asked for suggestions, Tanya recommended the Blackened seasoning.  For sides, we chose the King Crab truffled Gnocci ($29), and Roasted Brussle Sprouts ($11).  The fish came a la carte on a large plate.  For being a split order, the portions were surprisingly generous.  The gnocci and brussle sprouts came as large sides to be shared.  The waitress dished the sides on the main plate.  Now, plated and ready to go, and accompanied by a basket of various breads, my wife and I embarked on the best meal we have ever had!  Initially, we agreed it had to be in the top three, but then we couldn't come up with where we had had a more impeccable meal (and service).  The Sea Bass was tender, flakey, moist, and so perfectly seasoned.  The Gnocci had large pieces of crab mixed with the creamy gnocci.  For the brussle sprouts, we like them almost burnt on the outside to bring out the flavor.  They, too, were perfectly roasted dark and tender!    We ate the all the fish, even though we were quite full.  We took home the leftover gnocci and brussle sprouts, which was enough to make another whole meal for two.  My wife made the comment that she wanted to take home a piece of the bread that was still in the bread basket.  The waitress said she would get us fresh ones.  With our leftovers, she packed four extra pieces of the fresh \"pretzle\" bread.  We travel a lot, we love to cook, and we love to eat at quality restaurants.  If you go to Vegas, you HAVE to eat here!  We hope your experience is as enjoyable as ours was!",

    "text": "We didnt get to sit in the treehouse, but we were nearby about two tables away.  This was on my  Bookmark before I even touched foot in LV, and only reserved here because we stayed another night and needed a destination. I was hesitant because I've seen postcard-type ads for this place at CES, and I believe that places that need to advertise aren't the best. Opentable also promoted it with extra points.  Anyways, OpenTable showed same day availability for party of 5, so I booked it anyways, no cost booking and I could cancel if I found a better place.  We were seated promptly at the reservation time, no need for a lengthy wait like the previous restaurants this past week. Mastro's wasnt that busy when we arrived, although it did once 8:30p rolled around.  We ordered our entrees and sides. However I did not know the entrees come as that, with the sides making the dish. What I also didn't know was the production involved once dinner arrived....  The production went as follows, you get one or two servers serving the entrees, then a supporting team of servers go around putting sides on your entree plate. I believe we had six servers, in a high paced whirlwind headturning array of food being served onto our plates.  The $37 lobster mash potato was alright, but having a similar $15 smaller portion lobster mash at N9NE the previous night, I would skip Mastro's and go for N9NE's.  I would skip the Au Gratin Potato, it was nothing more than potato with cheese melted on top, not what I expected.  Creamed spinach was good.   Yes, the booze is marked up.  All told, of the three dinners I had in LV, this ranked third.",

I had not heard of it before but when I saw the very high ratings decided to give it a try. All I can say is AMAZING!  The service was excellent!  Make sure you ask for Mike. He was a excellent waiter. He took his time answering all of our questions and his service was prompt and personal. The food was super delicious.  I had the ribeye cooked hard medium. Talk about juicy and full of flavor! I'm a firm believer that a good steak does not need steak sauce and brother let me tell you absolutely no steak sauce needed. Same for my wife, she had a filet (Oscar style). I paired my steak with a grilled lobster tail. OMG, talk about good. For our sides (ala cart) we had the saute asparagus and mashed sweet potatoes. Both very flavorful.  We paired our meal with wine. I had a perfect balanced Summerland Pinot (flavor was heavier than some Pinots but not as heavy as a Cab). My wife had a Jaylor Cab (pretty sure I spelled it wrong). She loved it with the crab and steak.  By the way the crab meat was large whole chunks.  Amazing!  For dessert Mike brought me a smaller version of their butter cake. OMG, OMG!!! I'm a huge chocolate fan and very rarely do I eat anything else, but this cake was phenomenal.  You have to try it.  That's all I will say.   Anyway I hope this helps. You can not go wrong with this restaurant.  Heck, we initially sat behind Shania Twain but moved because other people in her party were a little loud and we wanted a quiet dinner experience.  From what we were told, they always have celebrities visiting.   Forgot to mention that we stayed at the Aria.  Which is right next to the Crystal Shops, where the restaurant is. Check them out too.   Enjoy!",

I know restaurants are very busy on Valentine's but the plastic tables they added to the restaurant (the one we sat at) is very tacky for the ambiance \"Mastro's\" gives off. We got put in a corner, right next to the server station, where we heard the servers chitter chatter throughout our whole meal, the wooden doors slamming as they grabbed items for tables was very annoying. It was just not the feel my boyfriend and I wanted for a romantic Valentine's. The food itself was very delicious. Our waiter did try and rush us throughout the whole meal. Only had about 5 minutes to eat my appetizer before our main course came to the table. At the end of the day not a great experience, I prefer Ruth Chris for a classy dinning experience.",

My sister and I took my mother out as part of her 85th birthday celebration that weekend.  (I am a member of the Palm but it was closed, and I know Mastro's from Scottsdale.)  Having had wonderful meals all week, I expected nothing less that exceptional service at Mastro's Ocean Club.  We had a lovely experience at the bar, but once seated, the experience went steadily downhill.  Aside from the very perfunctory service by our server, Michael, and some hiccups throughout the meal, the greatest disappointment was the rush to clear our main dinner plates and the placement of dessert plates for what otherwise would have been a surprise birthday cake.  We had to ask for lemon for hands, and when the linens arrived, there was no server to remove them, leaving us to place them on the table.  We waited for the cake, and had a nice little celebration, but then no server came to cut and serve.  I can serve myself at home, but I do not expect to do so when I am dining out. I can't say that Michael was busy as there were several empty table.  Perhaps my expectations were too high as I was expecting the service I experience at Preston's, Dominick's, and Capital Grill.  Mastro's Ocean Club does not come close to even sub-par.",

    "text": "Mastro's Ocean Club is smack dab in the middle of the Aria City Center mall. Because of  this, the ambiance and setting is not as upscale as the one in Beverly Hills. This place has more of a casual setting to it but most people will dress in their casual Friday attire.  The food was great.. very similar to the food at Beverly Hill location but because of the Ocean Club name, they have more fresh seafood at this location.. I still think that Mastro's excels in steak so unless you don't eat beef, why would you order anything else?  Also, I recommend that you make reservations to this place. When I went, they were not busy (they had like 6 parties dining), they insisted that they were. Make sure you specifically ask to dine in the Treehouse. This is the middle part of the restaurant that overlooks the mall. Anywhere else, and you end up close to the piano, and the piano's volume can get overwhelming.  All in all, Mastro's in Vegas is a good steakhouse. But because of it's prices, I expected it to be a little more on the personal and upscale level. but the fact that it's in the mall makes it seem like they are a more casual restaurant with high prices. I personally prefer the Mastro's in Beverly Hills. If you are a local to Vegas, definitely give this place a try. All of you that did the 4 hour commute to Vegas, drive back and go to the one on Canan in the 90210.",

The lobster mash was humongous and delish with lots of lobster pieces, meats were tender, fish buttery, service sublime (checked on us without disturbing & smiled when serving), ended with desert to die for.

    "text": "My first Mastro's experience took place inside the treehouse of the steakhouse chain's Las Vegas restaurant. I had never expected to take the plunge at Mastro's in Vegas, as I have been eyeballing its SoCal locations for years but never had set foot inside.  The verdict? In the overall spectrum of Las Vegas steakhouses, Mastro's was superior to Craftsteak but a significant step down from CUT.   The high point of the meal arrived early in the form of the seafood tower, which was over-the-top but fantastic. In short, the seafood tower here crushes the one at Oceanaire. It's the best reason to have dinner here.  The low point of the meal was my filet. In fact, in an unexpected turn of events, I left feeling as though I should have ordered the salmon instead. Like everyone else at my table did. As for wine, order the duck horn merlot.   Surprisingly, another underwhelming aspect of the meal were the sides. Mastro's take on mac and cheese was a bust compared to CUT. The lobster mashed potatoes were a let down too, especially given the hype and eye-popping price tag. As a salad, I had wanted to order the caprese, which generally is a favorite of mine. Our server talked me into the heirloom burrata instead, which I regretted doing after tasting it.  For dessert, the chocolate cake sounded like the best choice after skimming the menu, but turned out to be dry. The better option was effectively donuts with ice cream. Neither, however, were good enough to recommend with much enthusiasm.",

    "text": "I found Mastro's on Yelp and didn't realize that it was the cool restaurant that looked like it was encased in a cocoon (now known as The Treehouse) when I shopped at the city center a couple of trips back.  I made reservations that day via Yelp and although we waited for about 15 minutes for our 9pm reservations, we were lucky enough to be seated in the Treehouse.  Very cool!    I had the lobster bisque for a starter and the bowl was HUGE!  It filled me up quite a bit and from the mid point on, I wished I had it to share but managed to drink it all.  It was a bit rich so I was kind of done with it before I finished it off but didn't want to waste any of it so I was a trooper and drank it to the last drop.  Chilean sea bass seemed to be the popular recommendation so that's what I ordered for my entree and that was definitely delicious.  It's a good thing I didn't order any sides because those two dishes totally filled me up!  Great place to try and would recommend at least going there once.  It is a bit pricey but I think worth the experience. Next time I go back, I'd like to go back with a whole bunch of people to get their seafood tower.  The table next to us ordered that and it looked really cool.  If not for the food, just to take a picture to post online.  Haha!",

Vanilla battered shrimp were outrageously huge (3x the size of jumbo shrimp, might want to note that on the menu) and too thick and chewy for me. I ordered my 8oz filet medium well; the waiter confirmed it would be lightly pink in the center, and it came out charred, crunchy and bone dry. Absolutely terrible.  A proper steakhouse always asks you if the steak was cooked to your liking; my waiter never asked me.   My girlfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass, also overcooked, and she pushed it aside after a few bites.  This place specializes in steak and seafood?  What a joke. Any high class restaurant in Vegas blows this place away, I've eaten at almost all of them. Of all the restaurants in the $100 per person class, I'd rate Mastro's dead last.   Service was good, albeit a little slow. The bright spots of our meal were the pretzel bread and chocolate pudding cake, they were delicious. Dining in the birdhouse was nice, but not worth the terrible food.",

We also got the gnocchi, which was great.  A little rich, but I think that was intentional.  Friends got fish and a sushi roll, both alright, but I expected a lot more out of a place that was charging so much.  Definitely can get better quality, especially in Vegas.",

We had a group of 8 and we decided to do family style and order apps.  We ordered the bone marrow, escargot, scallops, and calamari    The bone marrow was okay in my opinion, but everyone loved it on my table.  I would have like some more accompaniment to enhance the flavors.  There was plenty of marrow, bread and  micro greens, and fine sea salt flakes.  It was very rich and flavor, but i had better.  it is still worth it.  The scallops were perfectly pan seared, and it came with a pleasant herb-y butter sauce.  Each bite was amazing and when you are done with the scallops.  The sauce was great for  bread  dipping.  The escargot was good.  it came with the standard butter, garlic and shallots.  T here is probably a few other herbs in there, but we ate them too fast to really look. .   The friend calamari was good and came with two sauce, tartar, and i think a remoulade.  After having the other items, i wasn't too impressed.  This would be a great dish, if it was somewhere else. But we are talking about Mastro's.  The OMG moment was a  bone in petite filet we ordered.  When i first saw it, i was very disappointed when i saw the waiter cut it,  It look raw.  I was thinking how can a place like this, don't know the difference between medium rare and raw.  Boy was i wrong.  The table decide we should try it and not waste it, because we all thought the same thing.  But when i bit into it, it was the most wonderful steak i had in recent memory.  It has a full of flavor, it was season to perfection.  Every bite, i wanted another one.   In the end, i would have fought off the table for the bone.  Lucky for me, no one wanted it.  I love the acidic marinade they used for the steak.  I guess it is a balsamic vinegar marinade.  Man, i want to go back so badly.  Anyway, i don't think i can top anything else in this review.  I have to say the signature pound cake was good, but you must really have a sweet tooth.    Waiters and bus people were amazing and entertaining.  they are here to give you the best experience they can.    so please tip well.  The decor is amazing, just go look at the pictures online.    Now i just want to go to any Mastro's and have that steak again.",

I was warned about the size of the steak and from the menu it was 22oz! That's ridiculous! Even if the bone was about 5oz, that's still a whopping 17oz!  All the servers here are exceptionally knowledgeable and professional. I felt like I was not treated as a kid eating at the adults' table.   We all shared a portion of the lobster mashed potatoes and by far they are the best mashed potatoes I've ever had. I would highly recommend trying this dish.  For my main entree, I ordered the 22oz Ribeye cooked medium rare. Although next time I would probably get rare+, I thought the medium rare was still delicious. The steak was massive and amazingly flavored. By the end of the meal I felt overwhelmed and defeated. I have never been conquered by how much steak there was until Mastro's.  My brain kept telling me to eat more but my stomach fought against this decision.  Overall, Mastro's was a great experience. The steak here, so far, is only second to the Kobe beef I had in Japan. I would definitely come back for seconds.",

    "text": "Believe the hype. This place is worth the hit on your bank account.   They took 5-star dining to a whole new level via a phone call the next day to see how our experience was the night before. Some patrons might not like this unsolicited call, but I didn't mind the show of courtesy.   Must haves: bone-in ribeye, truffle crab gnocchi, and brussel sprouts.   Further proof they're all about customer service: they automatically split our entree in half for us (no split fee). Also, we were apprehensive about ordering the full order of the truffle gnocchi, so our server offered to give us a half portion (for exactly half the price: $16). This was NOT on the menu, and the half order is more than enough for 2 people (I can't imagine how huge the full order must be). If just two of you, I highly recommend you ask for the half portion and order something else.   So, here's a PERFECT meal at this Mastros for 2 people at ~$100 (no alcohol)-  1. Bone-in Ribeye 22oz ($59) 2. Half order of the Truffle Gnocchi ($16) 3. Brussel Sprouts ($11), or whatever other side dish you prefer  That's A LOT of food for 2 people. Trust me. And everything's mindblowing.   Lastly, can another unoriginal idiot please post another unoriginal picture of the restaurant's structure? There aren't enough of them on yelp. Thanks.",

Disappointing....I love when the butter cake is perfectly warm with the cold ice cream. It just wasn't as amazing as it normally is!

    "text": "It looks like it's all been said before, so I'll keep this short (as much as I can manage) and sweet.    Impressive digs: the sculptural treehouse dining room is a gem.  The bar is impressive (a two story shelf of bottles).    The service is absolutely top notch: when we arrived for our 8:30 pm reservations, the hosts apologized but there was going to be a twenty minute delay.  We weren't bothered at all by the wait, but we were still given glasses of complimentary champagne--and we were treated to the restaurant's signature Warm Butter Cake for dessert.  I have absolutely no complaints about the delay in getting seated.  Mastro's handled a difficult situation appropriately, and in my opinion, went above and beyond for myself and the other guests that were also seated late.  My boyfriend and I went all out for dinner and ordered the seared ahi appetizer as well as the Hamachi with Fried Onions.  Please, oh please make sure you get this.  I've never seen anything like it before.  The perfectly fried onions melt on your tongue like butter, and the hamachi was perfect.  What an amazing combination.  We ordered the Bone-In 12 Oz Filet and the 22 Oz Rack of Lamb with a side of Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese and Roasted Brussels Sprouts.   The proteins were cooked perfectly and were absolutely delicious, but the stand out dish on the table was the flippin' amazing Mac & Cheese.  We talked about it at the restaurant, as we were leaving the restaurant, while we were next door at the Aria casino, on our flight home, and ever since we've been back home.  They are out of this world.  We were so sad that we weren't able to take home the leftovers.  Dessert: what hasn't been said about the Warm Butter Cake already?  Just get it already.  This place is spendy--and totally worth every penny.",

    "text": "We recently dined here for my husband's birthday. Having been at the Mastro's in Scottsdale, we knew what to expect: tasty appetizers, good drinks, and even better steak, so we were excited to check out this location.  The restaurant itself is in a unique setting: inside the high-end Crystal mall in the ARIA in a wooden tree house sculpture - pretty unique! I will say that having dinner while being able to look out at the Fendi & Louis Vuitton store did seem to downplay the high-end feel of this restaurant and it made me really annoyed (I know, hater) at all the women walking around with their Chanel & Prada shopping bags.  We were promptly seated outside of the tree house in the booths and as usual, service was second to none. They were aware of the gluten-free dining note on our Open Table reservation and brought me the Gluten Free Menu which is pretty large and almost mirrors the regular menu with a few exceptions and some alterations.  Large signature cocktail, beer and wine menu - I liked that they denoted which cocktails were gluten free as this is usually a place in the gluten-free menus restaurants ignore. Stunning and colorful bar - my husband liked the large selection of craft beers as well. The two TVs flanking the bar though did seem out of place.  For a starter, the shrimp cocktail is a great choice: presentation is really cool with the dry ice vapor, the shrimp are HUGE and the sauce is good. For an entree, I went with the filet. Instead of their regular rub which contains gluten, they will season it with salt & black pepper. It was a huge portion (had I known, I would have ordered the small filet) and it was cooked well and they even did a butterfly cut to ensure it cooked through. I also ordered a side of green beans with sliced almonds - tasty & fresh however, there were no almonds...   Our waiter was extremely friendly and knowledgeable and did a great job of checking up on us despite a busy Saturday night.  He was even nice enough to bring out some chocolate covered strawberry with whipped cream on the house to celebrate my husband's birthday which was even more thoughtful because he made sure it was a dessert I could eat given my gluten-free diet.  We had an awesome time, with superb food and drinks and top of the line service. Would highly recommend for a nice dinner, but be prepared to spend at least couple of hundred dollars on this indulgence!",

I had the 12oz filet, wedge salad, garlic mashed potatoes, clam chowder, chocolate covered strawberries, and a glass of Hess Cabernet. Everything is a la carte, with large portions. I would say the cost is equivalent to most steakhouse prices, but Mastro's has great sized portions and amazing quality. We highly recommend the Las Vegas location and will be visiting the New Port Beach location for our next date night. Hoping to have another wonderful dinner in NPB very soon!",

I've been fortunate enough to eat here a few times on a corporate dime, and a few times on my own. It's always been a very good experience.

    "text": "I used to always walk by this place during undergrad thinking... \"Man will i ever make enough to be able to eat at this place?\" I still don't but pulled the trigger one night before watching the game of thrones concert. Call it an off night which i'm sure it definitely was because I really wasn't all that impressed with the service or the food.  ***Since this is a $$$$ restaurant, i'm gonna be much more critical so please don't think i'm being pompous***  Service: A beautiful wood hive embodies the restaurant as its worker bees hustle to make amazing food with beyond satisfactory service is the impression at first glance but upon being seated my plate had a long strand of hair waiting for me. Waiter was prompted and merely switched it out without any real apologetic notion. \"ohh oops... is this your first time here?\" I expected more of \"My dear this is absolutely unacceptable, please excuse this avoidable mistake.\" Our server was a middle aged man with what sounded like a scottish accent seemed a bit perplexed maybe it was his first few shifts working here but didn't represent the valor of \"Mastros\" that I have heard so much about. The wait staff was efficient in clearing plates and refilling our waters. I ordered my rack of lamb medium rare and it came out quite rare. The server was accommodating to take the piece back to have it more evenly cooked.   Food: Calamari was pretty standard compared to other calamari I have had at other restaurant. The Lobster bisque was definitely the highlight of the night, Full pieces of lobster claw and meat in my soup that was genuine since I was interrupted by a piece of shell in my mouth as I was enjoying this otherwise wonderful soup. Garlic mashed potatoes was standard and the gorgonzola mac & cheese was good but a bit thick with al dente macaroni. I was hoping for mac & cheese more on the soft buttery cheesy side but the cheese was quite solidified. Rack of lamb was excellent but make sure you order it medium and no more rarer than this. By the end of the meal we were too full to get dessert which I know they are famous for but at this point I wasn't to impressed with dinner.   Overall: I really can't say if i'll give this place a chance. I'm not big into fancy restaurants unless the occasion calls for it and the next special night I have i'll probably end up going to one of my favorite spots in Vegas, Echo and Rig.",

    "text": "This place is so good and totally worth the Vegas prices (note that you will probably spend about $100 per person). From reading many Yelp reviews, I developed a strategy. Share one of the bigger steaks with one person (because it's cheaper that way) and then split the sides with everyone. You will be super full - unless you love steak so much that you just have to have your own. I think the way most people do it is that they order their main dish - whether it be steak or seafood - and then you order a bunch of sides that the servers split and put on your plate.  We came with a party of six, and so here's what we got:   - I split a 12 oz filet with one other person, and they will totally plate it for you if you tell them you are splitting it. Two of my other friends split the 16 oz bone-in. And one of our friends got their special wagyu steak. I will say that I'm not a super huge fan of steak, but the steak here was cooked perfectly, seasoned well, and the wagyu was incredible. Best steak I've ever eaten - the perfect ratio of fat and meat made it just melt in your mouth.   - Lobster Mashed Potatoes: We were on the fence about this side dish because some of the reviews were meh about it. However, I'd say get it! The big chunks of lobster in the creamy mashed potatoes makes it so delicious. If you like lobster and mashed potatoes, definitely go for this dish. They put quite a bit of lobster in here - hence the hefty price tag of $35.   - Alaskan Crab Truffle Gnocchi: This is super delicious as well. The gnocchi is soft and pillowy the way it's supposed to be and the truffle flavor is perfect. I didn't really get pieces of crab in the serving I got, but I know the crab was in there.   - Brussel Sprouts: This was the only dish that was actually not done well to me. I like my brussel sprouts with a bit of caramelization and soft on the inside. Some of these just tasted incredibly burnt and the flavor wasn't great. I would pass on this as a side next time.   - Mac & Cheese: This mac & cheese was pretty excellent. The noodles were cooked perfectly and it was amazingly cheesy. It was so cheesy that it did that stringy cheese thing when the server put it on our plate. A classically delicious side!   For dessert, we listened to the rave reviews and got the butter cake. And you know what, it was underwhelming to me. I like desserts that are lighter and less sweet, especially after we got such a crazy rich meal. The warm butter cake is extremely rich, it comes with a dollop on ice cream on top and a side of whipped cream. It is more than enough to share between six people, especially after the meal we had. I personally thought it was too rich and sweet, but enough people have raved about it on here that you should give it a try.   The service here is very good. I especially appreciate that our server stopped us from getting two sides of the gnocchi. He thought it would be wayyy too much food for us and he was totally right. All in all, this was an incredibly rich and decadent meal and totally delicious. I would definitely come back again for some of the things we got.",

The food and service is amaze balls. If you are a steak lover like I'am. Then this place is for you. It's super ultra expensive. I had my New York Strip steak for $57.00 alone. Yes alone meaning you have to order sides for extra cost. But mind you! You are getting the very best in high quality meat. So expect to pay that much.   The sides comes out in family style in small platters. So you can take out what amount you want.   The wait staff pays attention to detail about you're visit. The waiters aren't overbearing. Always ask to be seated in the birds nest for an amazing experience. The architecture of the birds nest is truly magical.   Five stars all around.   Go get you're steak now.",

For appetizers we had caviar, king crab cocktail, crab cakes and smoked salon. Entrees we did family style and had the sea bass, blackened halibut, bone in rib eye (18oz), twin lobster tails, Gorgonzola Mac and cheese, king crab truffle gnocchi, sea salt and vinegar fries and asparagus. Everything was amazing! Even the wine was delicious! We started with a Duckhorn Merlot from the coravin section and ended with another red that I can't remember because I was mesmerized by the food. Thank you for the amazing experience!",

It was perfectly cooked as a \"medium rare\" steak as he requested, and it was melt in your mouth quality. I only have one other fancy steakhouse restaurant to compare it to and that's Ruth Chris' Steakhouse....And I would say this is better. The buttercake dessert is also to die for even though you might literally die from a heart attack from it because I'm sure it's not the healthiest thing out there, but it is sooo worth cheating any diet to try it! Again, I rarely eat red meat and I freaking love the steak here and believe that this may have been the greatest thing I've ever tasted. The texture and taste are both on point. I definitely want to come back!!!",

    "text": "The first time I dined at one of the Mastro's was over 5 years ago in SoCal.  I was with co-workers celebrating a huge case and were told to expense our entire meal.  My first experience was over-the-top due to the amount of money that was spent for dinner, desserts, beers, and alcohol.  I never had the chance to try Las Vegas' Mastro's until recently.   We were celebrating Valentine's Day a couple of days before the actual day to avoid the crowds.  We arrived about 10 minutes before our reservation and was immediately seated. Service throughout our entire dinner was as good as expected from a place like Mastro's.  We were served bread pretty much as soon as we sat.  The entire bread basket was very good.  The bread basket consist of a dinner bread, garlic bread, and pretzel bread. The basket had two of each, which is perfect if you're sharing with just one other person.  I ordered the 8 oz. filet and it was marvelous.  It's so lean, tender, and enough to keep me satisfied for a few hours.  We also shared the twice baked potato and this was a beast.  It's huge and a half serving is equivalent to most restaurant's full sized potato.  The highlight of the evening had to be dessert.  I have steak all the time and have to admit that I was looking forward to their Signature Warm Butter Cake the whole evening.  The dessert is really simple....just a butter cake, ice cream, strawberry drizzle, and heavy whipped cream.  Every part of this dessert was amazing.  Trust me, the Signature Warm Butter Cake is worth the trip to Mastro's.",

    "text": "Our waiter by the name of Craig was THE WORST server EVER. He was VERY rude and did not make myself and husband feel cared about at all. He took literally 5-10 to just come over and greet us and when he did he didn't let us know about any specials, whether it was our first time here or not, etc he just asked if he wanted to start off with water and walked off. He came back maybe 10 min later and then asked us if we wanted a cocktail and at that point we were already ready to order. When we ordered he was very short and not pleasant. He grabbed the menus and left and never came back over until when our food had arrived and asked how everything looked and never came back over to check on us until the end when he asked if we wanted dessert. At this point my blood was boiling because I've been to mastro's Plenty of times in Los Angeles and what stands out about them is not just their delicious steaks but also their superb customer service. Craig then came back with the bill even though we didn't even ask for it and instead placing the bill on the table he slid it over to us on the table and walked off. No thank you very much enjoy the rest of your evening. I left him no tip which was very hurtful because I'm always generous when I tip for great service. We thought at first maybe he was like that because he was having a bad day, but we watched how he interacted with his other tables and it was complete night and day. To be honest, our real waiter was the bus boys, they were more attentive to use than Craig was. The only reason why I know why his name is Craig is because I had to look on my receipt. Never like to play the race card, but just simply put: Craig had a PROBLEM with waiting on a black table. Mastro's I'm sooo upset with you, and Craig I hope you never have anyone make you feel the way that you made me and my husband feel #blackisbeautiful  I just feel that if you're going to spend quite a bit of money for great food, then the service should be EXCELLENT. I did end up speaking to one of the managers name Dan and yes I do feel that he listened to what I had to say, but at the same time I feel that he was kind of defending Craig by saying he's been a server for years there and he's never had a complaint. Kinda hard to believe ",

    "text": "Another bookmark that took us a while to check off, Mastro's Ocean Club is located at the Crystals Shops.  We celebrated Valentine's Day two days early to avoid all the crowds on the actual day.  We arrived at the appointed reservation time and were seated promptly in the \"birds' nest\" area of the restaurant.  All I've heard from friends about Mastro's centers around the Signature Warm Butter Cake dessert and we did have that, but first, dinner.  After perusing the menu and hearing the options available, I settled on surf and turf with the petite filet mignon (6 oz.) Oscar-style with crab meat and Bearnaise sauce.  According to our waiter, the meat of two large crab legs comes with the filet and when it was served, this did actually seem to be the case.  The dish was just the perfect size for me, plus we shared a large twice-baked potato.  Service throughout our meal was attentive, but not cloyingly so:  our glasses were never empty for long.  Oh, I forgot to mention the bread basket that came to the table first:  a carb lover's dream! We counted three different kinds of bread:  pretzel bread, garlic bread, and sourdough with the pretzel bread being my definite favorite.   As I mentioned, we finally got to try the famous butter cake served with a big scoop of vanilla ice cream and whipped cream on the side:  heavenly!   Mastro's is definitely a wonderful choice for a special occasion when you want to spoil yourselves.",

We asked to be seated in the tree house. They went out of their way to do this for us (Saturday night in Vegas and March Madness)not an easy request. Started at the bar for cocktails, staff was great and they pour them STIFF. The food was fabulous to say the least, but the staff was the True star. Very involved in our experience and wanting it to be a perfect night for us. They all took the time to engage with us and have a little fun. GREAT JOB MASTROS. Locals dining on the strip usually feel like just another one of the herd, but not at Mastros. You were on point and for that you have earned two new loyal customers.",

Dinner was the salmon for me, and rack of lamb for my husband with sauteed broccoli as a side.  Everything was delicious, and spaced out to where we did not feel rushed what so ever.  Not only was the food top notch, so was the service.

    "text": "Still outstanding.  Seafood, expertly prepared served in a contemporary tree house in the middle of the desert.  It never gets old.   All this from a chain restaurant.  The fish version of a steakhouse.  Large filet cuts of fresh fish, simply seasoned and grilled.  No swimming in sauces, no embellishments on the plate.  Sides, like at a steakhouse are ordered separately and meant to be  shared.  The food; this isn't a sushi restaurant or a steakhouse.  Nuff said.  Classic cold starters from perfectly cooked and chilled jumbo (U8) shrimp, sweet chunks of Dungeness crab leg meat, chunks of just cooked through lobster all served with a zesty cocktail sauce are all excellent.    For something warm, the sauteed day boat sea scallops, ocean candy.  Perfect sear, mid rare, enhanced with a bit of butter and squeeze of lemon.  Also consider sharing the Vanilla battered lobster (a main).  Sounds weird, but the vanilla imparts an indescribable flavor that heightens the oceanic sweetness of the lobster.  The light tempura style batter provides a hint of textural contrast.  Mains are all about the fish.  The Scottish salmon, simply seasoned and grilled medium is outstanding.  Loaded with creamy fat that carries the unmistakable sweet flavor of salmon.  The flavor goes on and on.  The Crusted Chilean sea bass cooked medium well is equally good.  Large flakes of moist, tender flesh oozing oceanic fattiness.     Save room for sides.  The lobster mashed potatoes remains excellent.  Seemingly more lobster than potato.  Perfectly cooked, large chunks of lobster enveloped in a buttery, mash, whole claws thrown in for good measure.  Sinfully delicious.  The Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, wow.  50 percent sweet king crab meat, 50 percent pillowy gnocchi in a delicate cream sauce imbued with black truffle oil and bits.  Aggressively seasoned but it works to heighten the umame finish that makes whatever piece of grilled fish accompanying it explode with flavor.  Very good wine program.  Typical Vegas resort markup.  Excellent steakhouse (I know) service.  Sometimes simple is best.",

I ordered the mussels and mashed potatoes.  They were really good.  The serving of mashed potatoes is enough to feed several people. The broth for the mussels was seasoned and not too salty.  I loved the lemon that was served in bags to catch the seeds.  The salmon was good but it could have used more flavoring.  My key lime martini was the most I have ever paid for a cocktail but I got two drinks out of the shaker and it was delicious.  For dessert the butter cake was very sweet but I saved half and ate it the next day.  The gigantic dish of whipped cream served with it is impossible to eat!  The tree house was interesting to dine in.  I wish Mastro's had a location in the Southeast so I could celebrate there more than once a year.",

From BAD placement, to RUDE servers and in the middle a very apologetic manager offering to move us from the table which was next to the buss boy/server station, where they made comments about the dinning guests and used foul language. To start the evening, we where staying at THE HOTEL and I had called ahead for reservations and informed the receptionist that it was a special occasion.On arriving  the young lady/Maitre d asked if it was a special evening and after answering YES she states she has a very special table for us! She then placed us next to the servers station when the restaurant was empty. The waiter came to our table and was RUDE, the food was HORRIBLE/ SUB PAR , we had the halibut special and the whole evening was one we will try to forget.

Right when we were seated, the server asked us if we cared for any drinks and offered us a warm towel to wipe our hands with. He also explained EVERYTHING on the menu which I thought was awesome.   My sister and I ordered two cocktails ($18/each for the cocktails) and we shared the salmon as a main course. For appetizer we had the escargot and oysters on the half shell. My bf ordered the filet mignon ($50+) but it was really tender and cooked to perfection. We also had the lobster mashed potatoes which I thought was great. The bill came out to be over $250 but I think it was well worth it for the great food, atmosphere and service.  I would suggest requesting for a seat inside the birdnest because every table is separated with a glass so it's very unique.",

Service was prompt; the waitress delightful and extremely knowledgeable. This was literally the best meal I have ever shared with my boyfriend of nearly a year. Each item was split and served on two plates in perfect presentation: the heirloom tomato salad, the blackened halibut. The brussel sprouts and lobster mash potatoes were of plenty proportions - and the mash had the most perfect creamy flavor with an abundance of lobster. The variety of breads were served warm with soften tabs of butter. Ever staff person was attentive. The drinks, a pomegranate martini and cucumber cooler, were a homerun. I've never tasted something better in my life. If I had the room, I know the butter cake would kick butt of any cake I ever ate (I'm going back today to make sure). And the coffee served at the end of the meal was the testament that the entire meal was EPIC. Thank you Mastro!",

You're sitting in a little wood bauble in the middle of a high end shopping mall and it's one of those \"only in Las Vegas\" sort of things.",

The tomato and mozzarella salad we shared wasn't memorable. In fact, for burratta mozzarella it wasn't good at all. I thoroughly enjoyed my bone-in filet which made up for the salad. The side of mashed potatoes was decent but not outstanding, same goes for the side of peas we shared. Mostly we went because the location was conveniently close to the Aria, where we stayed, and because after seeing the tree house on a previous visit to Vegas I desperately wanted to eat there. Being in the tree house wasn't the best experience. It's loud, since you are in the middle of the Crystal's mall. All in all, it was decent but overpriced in my opinion. I probably won't be returning to this Mastro's location.",

We started off with a couple cosmos which are my favorite at the Ocean Club because they seem to be never ending and they use dry ice to keep it exceptionally cold!  For our entree we chose the seafood tower (see pic) which was amazing and a ton of food!  After that we could not eat anything more except desert and our waitress Shauna told us the Butter Cake could not be beat and she was right.  I would definitely recommend  Mastro's Ocean Club for a fine dining experience... the service is spectacular, the food is spectacular and the restaurant is very cool.",

It was like a one night stand you want to call you again. Real classy joint. The whole family went to Vegas for Christmas. Since we are Jews, we decided to forego the stereotypical Chinese food and step it up a bit.  We were looking for a nice steakhouse and we were torn between Craft Steak or Maestros- Since we were staying at Vdara, Maestro's was closer.  Thank goodness- hands down best steak I've ever had. Even my picky eater girls loved it. I had the filet- melted in my mouth like butter.  We ordered the mussels, crab claws, bone marrow, salmon, broccoli, sweet potato fries, spinach- I don't normally eat seafood but I was so stuffed and satisfied when I left- I'll let you make the one night stand joke this time. EAT HERE.",

    "text": "Diane and I enjoyed another night here with friends, where golden Fried Calamari with Sweet Chili Oil and Spicy Aoli and Vanilla Battered Shrimp served as very nice starters, along with a complimentary bread basket.  Once all the great Pretzel Bread had been consumed, I asked for more, and we received an entire basket of Pretzel Bread to accompany the remainder of our meal.   Then I indulged in a bowl of smooth and creamy, potato-chunk-laden bowl of Clam Chowder, while Diane waxed euphoric over her bowl of Lobster Bisque with a generous dollop of Creme Fraiche.  An excellent small House Salad with Bleu Cheese Dressing was not that small, and surprised me with an unexpected, large cooked Breaded Shrimp lying on top of the mixed greens.  Now for the entrees!  Never tiring of vanilla battered crustaceans, Diane ordered a Vanilla Battered Lobster Tail along with a Steamed Lobster Tail for her main, both of which she very much liked.  A Twice Baked Potato remained untouched until it was boxed and enjoyed by her for lunch at a later date.  Although I usually make it a point to order steak at a steak house, this time I was in the mood for another treasure of the sea.  So I uncharacteristically ordered Grilled New Zealand King Salmon, accompanied by Roasted Brussels Sprouts and French Fried Potatoes.  The Salmon was moist and all I hoped for; the Brussels Sprouts perfectly al dente; and the crisp French Fries hot and enormous in quantity.  Half of the Fries were taken home to be eaten for lunch the next day.  For dessert I opted to slim things down with an order of Mixed Seasonal Berries (Strawberries, Raspberries, and Blueberries), only to then balloon up the calories and sugar intake by finding it difficult to resist the bowl of Homemade Whipped Cream which accompanied this dish.  Meanwhile one of my tablemates pronounced the Creme Brulee the best she had ever had.  Service by multiple servers was exemplary, and the atmosphere inside the nest overlooking The Shops at Crystal classy and somewhat romantic.  Another great dinner at Mastro's!",

    "text": "Omfg I love Mastro's. Although it's a chain restaurant, I really love the consistency regardless of the location you dine at. I've been to the Beverly Hills and Costa Mesa locations before trying this one. And all I have to say is LOBSTER. MASHED. POTATOES. I could eat that everyday (if it wouldn't make me gain 19362916392 lbs from the delicious cream and butter they make it with).   We came here for my bestie's bday and interesting enough didn't order a single steak. Hah! I love a good steak, but their seafood is actually so yummy too. Here's what we got:  - CAESAR SALAD: there's no Caesar salad like a steakhouse Caesars salad. I swear it's so freaking delicious and made with real anchovies and I just want to eat this every single day. 10/10  - OYSTERS ROCKEFELLER: tbh this isn't my favorite dish, but that's not a Mastro's issue. I didn't care for it in culinary school when I was introduced to it, and I don't really care for it now. BUT my bestie wanted to try it. Mastro's wasn't bad, but all I could taste was the Parmesan (we also had to get it without any meat they typically add - my bestie is a pescatarian). Comes with 6 oysters. 7/10  - HAMACHI WITH CRISPY ONIONS: ahh this was so tasty. It was a light addition to our apps. It's thin pieces of hamachi topped with a ponzu truffle oil, truffle salt and crispy onion. GIVE IT TO ME!! 10/10  - SAUTEED SCALLOPS: YUM! They cooked these perfectly - beautifully pan seared on the outside and so delicate on the inside. Comes with about 5 scallops - 10/10  - LOBSTER MASHED POTATOES: so this is my favorite thing and I get it always.... who doesn't love creamy, heaven sent whipped potatoes topped with succulent lobster. 15/10. YEAH THEY'RE THAT GOOD!!   - KING CRAB TRUFFLE GNOCCHI: I was not prepared for there to be a side to compete with the mash, but holy moly this one gave it a run for its money. I love truffle, gnocchi and king crab so this was a HIT. 12/10 (not quite the mash, but also heaven sent)  - BUTTER CAKE: I feel like if you're coming here, who cares about a diet anyway.... amirite?!?! Yeah so get this. I don't care how full you are... it's warm, beautiful butter cake, topped with vanilla ice cream and served with whipped cream on the side. Worst case scenario, you bring it home... and eat it for breakfast the next day. Hah! No but for real- get this. 10/10  The service here was also great. Our server dropped many things, but I was so engaged with how delicious my meal was, it didn't really bother me. It was hot as hell in there, but I think that's Crystals vs. a Mastro's issue.",

The staff are professional and pleasant, but not 5 star worthy.  Another thing I noticed is that this location doesn't really care how you look walking into their \"5-star experience\" restaurant.  I came on a Friday night around 8 p.m. and there were many people eating with casual dress on.  This would not fly in BH lol.  The food is priced how you would expect it to be...this isn't an Applebee's.  I decided on some wine (Browne Family Vineyards @ $23/glass) and the person I went with ordered Hennessy on the rocks (unsure the cost of that, but it wasn't just a shot -- good portion.)  The wine was yummy, but I've experienced better for less.  The bread bowl and butter are always a good way to start your meal.  I always have to stop myself because I could eat that pretzel bread for the rest of my life.  We both ended up getting a Filet Mignon (mine 8 oz. and his 12 oz. -- $52 / $59).  Also, 3 sides.  Lobster mashed potatoes, because you can NEVER pass this up if you're going to Mastro's - $38  Creamed spinach - $14 Steamed asparagus - $14  The sides are a la carte, but there is plenty to share!  They bring them out with a serving spoon, ask you which sides you'd like, and put your serving on your plate.  The lobster mashed potatoes are of course the best side you can possibly order, but everything else was satisfying too.  My steak had plenty of moisture and flavour to it so I was pleased.  Our waiter was helpful, but not as attentive as the waiters in BH.  They are always on top of everything!  Either way, this location wasn't horrible and I'm sure I'll be returning since I am obviously closer to this one.  But I will say that it's not at my top lists of restaurants in Vegas.",

Highly recommended by our son who has been to a couple locations in SoCal, we decided to make reservations since they had a Mastros here in Vegas.  The place was elegant and the service was over the top.  For appetizers, we went with the shrimp cocktail for appetizers (sweet and plump). The rest, we decided to go with what the son recommended (his favorites). The hubby had the steak of the evening and I had the salmon with tapenade.  Both entrees were cooked perfectly!  For the side, we went with the lobster mashed potatoes.  They should have called it \"lobster with mashed potatoes\" since the lobster meat came in huge potions...it was decadent!  As we waited they delivered a huge basket of piping hot breads of all sorts.  Our favorite was the warm chewy pretzels.  Dinner was amazing, everything cooked perfectly.  Got to chit chat more with the manager who told us Mastros in SF is soon to open up.  Excited to check that out!",

    "text": "My husband and I dine out often, and while in Vegas we were excited to experience Mastro's and see what the hype was all about. It was sadly underwhelming. Attentiveness from the wait staff and management were good, the kitchen was slow and the food was very disappointing. The waiter encouraged my husband and I to split the chopped salad which sounded great. It came out very bland and the iceberg lettuce ruined the flavor.   I ordered the petite filet which arrived over cooked and my husband ordered the halibut \"orgenata\" style. The fish was flavorless and the sauce served with it had an overpowering lemon zing.   On to the sides. My husband and I love creamed corn and order it often at five star restaurants. This version was on the runny side and not even tasty. The Mac and Cheese was too al dente and the pasta was oily, not cheesy. There was a layer of cheese on top, but none throughout the dish. I love Mac and Cheese and could not force myself to eat it. Much to our waiters insult it was sent back to the kitchen. The service was so slow that we didn't have have time for dessert before heading out to catch our show. Perhaps we should have opted for one of the seafood towers they are known for.   If you're seeking ambiance and good service this is a good place. If you're seeking great food, I'd dine elsewhere. We will not return.",

So a run down of dinner tonight is   Bread was pretty good, hot and fresh out of the oven, there was this one with like ... parmesan on it? YUM  First dish to come out, Roasted Bone Marrow, really deep flavor pairs good with the little toasted bread. Very delicious, and was my first time trying it :)  Moving on to the Burrata salad, this is my favorite type of cheese, whenever I see it I always order it, the Burrata itself was pretty yum paired with heirloom tomatoes topped with balsamic. A classic cant go wrong.  Next appetizer, was crab cakes, pretty nice and meaty, although gotta say I've had better. Thank you, next.  For main course we had the pan seared Sea Bass, which was good. Also a 12oz bone in filet. Sides garlic mashed potatoes, yuuum and asparagus which was eh, my own personal preference is I dont typically like the larger ones.   Finished with some chocolate covered strawberries :)",

And the fried calamari... the batter is all you can taste and still its not tasty at all. We asked for 2 medium well steaks. One is burned and the other one is soaking bloody on my plate. It was my husband's birthday and it was a mistake to choose this place. I will not recommend this place.  I should have also read the not recommended reviews at the bottom of this page. There were mostly 3 stars that were taken down.",

    "text": "I chose this spot to celebrate my birthday. I wanted to go somewhere special since we don't go to fancy places anymore since having kids. I was not disappointed with my choice.   Let me start with the service. Our server was Edgar, but my bf swears his name was Hector. I apologize if I'm wrong. Anyhow, he was amazing. He was very easy to talk to. Our conversation about being locals and loving Vegas was not forced. He was genuine with his words and I felt like he was actually listening to us when he asked how my day was going. 5 star service definitely goes to him.   On to the food...that bread basket to start was awesome. I liked how there was a variety of bread instead of just one type. Since it was my birthday, I ordered myself the Elderflower martini which had St Germain and Hendricks gin. This cocktail was light and clean tasting and was not too heavy with the meal. For the appetizer we ordered the sauteed scallops which were cooked to perfection. I loved the buttery sauce that it came with and soaked it up with the crostinis. For our main course, I opted for the Chilean sea bass and my bf got the 22 oz rib eye. My fish was moist, buttery and flaky. I didn't try my bf's steak since he ordered it rare, but he said it was one of the best steaks he's ever eaten. For our sides, we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and Brussel sprouts. Those lobster mashed potatoes...OMG, like heaven in your mouth. They were silky and smooth with huge chunks of lobster. And for dessert, we opted for the butter cake which was served with ice cream and hand made whipped cream. Dear Jesus, I could have eaten the whipped cream by itself. It was that good.   Now the reason I can't justify giving them a 5 star rating is for a few things. The Brussel sprouts were dry and boring. I make this much better at home. If I'm going to pay $14 for a small dish of Brussel sprouts, they better be amazing. And sadly, these were not. I was also excited to try their elusive butter cake. What we got was a dry and crumbly piece of whatever it is they gave us. It was literally like eating sand cake. Not even the ice cream or whipped cream it was served with could have saved it. And my last annoyance was that the tables were waaay too close together. I wanted to enjoy my meal since my bf and I never have alone time. Instead, they sat another party next to us and I listened to their snooty \"we have so much money\" conversation the entire time.   My tummy was definitely happy after this meal. I'm glad I was able to celebrate my birthday here. This will definitely be a spot to consider again for our next special date night. Maybe next time I'll ask to sit in their tree house where it isn't so crowded.",

Looks are a little deceiving because walking in looks a little small but this place is really big. Once inside immediately seated and be forewarned make a reservation because this place gets very busy. Our waitress was so nice and couldn't have asked for better service.   For dinner I had the salmon accompanied by a side of the roasted asparagus and lobster mash potatoes. Another warning the sides are huge and meant for sharing. we wanted to get appetizers but it was a long day and we were all pretty hangry so it was right to business with ordering food and salads to start. The salmon was amazing and even though they have steak options couldn't imagine eating here and not eating what they are known for which is fish. After an amazing meal we just sat here and talked and enjoyed the company. There was no rush to leave and even tough we were done our waitress acted like we just arrived. Great choice for dinner while in Las Vegas and would highly recommend  to anyone...promise you will have a great time",

Highly, highly recommend the scallops. I do have to say, we usually order the creamed spinach at the Chicago location, but I felt that the creamed spinach we had here was not as good.

The complimentary bread basket is huge with many varieties of breads and a side of butter. The bread was soft and warm, however the butter was a tad too salty.  I skipped the appetizers and went straight for the entree. Blackened salmon was my choice! Also ordered a side of wild mushrooms with truffle butter. Salted caramel martini was my drink that night.  The entree plate came with a generous and the most delicious piece of salmon. Perfectly cooked and juicy. Loved every bite of it. The side of wild mushrooms was also my favorite!  I highly recommend making a trip to Maestro's for dinner when in Vegas. You're sure to love it. Not just the food, but the high end ambiance and service all adds up to a perfect dinner experience.",

Both restaurants exude that high end feeling and you will leave feeling... well feeling awesome that you spent 50 bucks on a slab of meat. But that's not all.  If you make an Open Table reservation they will always call you the day of to confirm and remind you that you are going to attend. One of the times I've been to this Mastro's Ocean Club and they were fully committed, and suggested to look for a seat at the bar area, and then one of the waitress or hostesses asked if I would mind eating on the piano (they had live music that time) which I found it hilarious, a $1k+ grand piano with me eating on it. Regardless I told her I would wait for a party at the bar to be seated but that was another time.   You're going to pay at least $70+ per person but the food along with the service makes it all worth it. Every time I go to Mastro's, the waiters/waitresses are always so nice, helpful, professional, and willing to answer any and all questions you may have about the menu. If you haven't been there before they will let you know the vastness of the menu and how they operate as a steakhouse/ocean club.  My reccemondations as far as Mastro's Ocean Club in Las Vegas?  Bone-in Fillet Bone-in Ribeye (although the Filet wins my money by a mile) Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi Lobster Mashed Potatoes Garlic Mashed Potatoes Ocean Club Salad And their Raw Oysters - wherever it is from because it is super fresh  If you go in on a special occasion like a birthday or a graduation, most of the time they'll give you a slice of chocolate cake as dessert and the most kick ass whipped cream you would have ever had the chance to have. Yes it is just that good.  Hope you guys enjoy it as much as I do. After writing this review, I'm just vying to go back.",

I wouldn't get it again the sashimi tuna-AMAZING the best tuna I have ever had, and the sesame seeds added a great flavor the gorgonzola mac and cheese- Mac and cheese with gorgonzola... do I really need to say how tasty this was? the butter cake-super moist and sweet, good texture and flavor  Overall, I love this place. We sat in the birdnest thing, great experience and view.",

Yeah, this's place is that good hahha  Food Tried:  Pretzel Bread - like a soft, warm, perfectly salted pretzel.  Lobster Mash - delish Mushrooms - I love these tasty mushrooms Spinach - not a big fan of spinach but Mastro's does it right  12 oz bone in filet - cooked just right. Med rare and awesome  Service: Great. Attentive and courteous. My friend couldn't finish his 22oz rib eye and asked to take the rest to go. They accidentally tossed it but went out of their way to make up for it. Our group was dressed casually and I can imagine some lesser establishments not giving us this type of great service based just on this alone.",

    "text": "Mastro's to me is just another steak house. Just like Fleming's or Morton's and Ruth's Chris, Morton's offers a very classic steak restaurant. Visiting Vegas, I made a decision I shouldn't have made. Not to say that going to Matro's Ocean Club inside the Shops At Crystals was a mistake or a bad experience. I just have a dining out rule when I'm in Vegas. \"If there's one in LA or OC, don't go there.\" Well, I broke my rule, but it was all for a birthday celebration. I figured, I probably won't be going to Mastro's anytime soon, so might as well. And the bird's nest really attracted me. I was really happy with my decision for the most part.  We started things of with bread service. They offered pretzel, crouton, baguette, dinner roll, and wheat bread. The breadbasket had variety all were quite good. My favorite was the pretzel -- it was soft and airy.  I had some of the Caesar salad to start. I needed some kind of greens to soak up all that meat juice. Their Caesar salad was near perfect. The dressing was nice and creamy. The addition of parmesan cheese and cracked pepper made everything better.  I was ready for the main event, the 22oz bone in rib eye. The rib eye is one of my favorite cuts because of the even fat marbling and soft texture. Mine was cooked perfectly medium rare, though a bit more on the rare side. This actually caused the meat to be a bit tough. This cut did have some nice fat running through the steak. This helped with the tenderness and mouth feel of the meat. Even though this wasn't the best steak I have had, the help of the amazing sides made it all better.  The real reason I came here wasn't the steak. Well it is, and it isn't. The real reason I came here was for the lobster mashed potatoes. I mean. It is Mastro's Ocean Club -- Ocean, meaning seafood is in order. This side dish was rich as can be -- full of butter. I believe the potato to butter ratio is near 1 to 1. With a whole lobster tail carefully chopped up and placed in a pool of butter, the potatoes were creamy and flavorful. The pure essence of the sea was encased in butter, and mixed with potatoes. Eating this with steak was pure bliss. The kid in me wanted to order the mac and cheese. made with gorgonzola, the flavor was very rich. Another cream heavy and dairy heavy dish, the mac and cheese was delicious. My favorite was the layer of melted cheese on top.  My favorite was dessert. We were celebrating a birthday, so they gave us a chocolate birthday cake. The cake was rich in chocolate and eating just a few bites was enough for me. The best thing about this dessert was their home made whipped cream. Served on the side in a bowl, the homemade whipped cream was so dense and fluffy. The cold cream and the chocolate cake was a perfect mixture. Honestly though, the whipped cream was the best thing ever. I wanted to take it all home.  Eating at Mastro's Ocean Club was a great experience. The location is a bit awkward. As you are enjoying your expensive meal inside an amazingly architectured \"bird's nest,\" you look out and you see people shopping. That is cool and all, but you can't help but think you are inside of a mall -- Well, you are inside of a mall, and this Mastro's makes sure you know that. I couldn't help but think I was at a very glorified food court at a mall. When I eat at a nice establishment, I want to feel secluded from the world. I just didn't get the at from here. The food is great, though as far as steakhouses go in Las Vegas, you can do a lot better. I guess I can only break my rule once. Never eat at Las Vegas where you can at home.",

All five  of our  dinner party's  meals were very subpar.  Our bill was $500. We were trying to celebrate a birthday for a nationally recognized physician.  All were very disappointed.  I have never written a review before but because this meal was such a rip off I felt it my duty.  Please do not go to this restaurant.   Spend your funds on a very nice show instead. You'll be so glad you did. The ambience at best is fair.  Please please do not go by published ratings as we did. They are misleading. I am confident  the restaurant is good in other cities but this one in Las Vegas is very sub par. It is a waste of your money. There are many better restaurants in this fun city.",

We went here just for dessert (Boss Man is a butter cake fiend) and sat in the bar area, but our service was as good as if we were ordering full dinners & bottles of expensive wine.  Don't take me to mean that anything here is cheap - that butter cake is going to be $16 but it's an absolutely enormous cake (like 6\" round) and served with a literal bucket of Chantilly cream. It's easily enough for 4-5 people or one person who's been jonesing for this cake.   Their wine list is well chosen and a pretty good value as well, all things considered. I had a French Cremant & for $10 it was an extremely generous pour.",

We made reservations a week prior to visiting Mastro's, which apparently was a wise thing to do. We were sat within 5 minutes of our arrival. The server greeted us and informed us of the daily specials. We ordered the calamari (yuummm) and a mojito (don't order it, you won't miss out on much, tastes like Sprite with a hint of mint). The drink however, will not affect the way I will review our main course and service. My husband and I both ordered a filet for dinner with a side of scalloped potatoes and asparagus.... The asparagus was fresh and cooked to perfection. The potatoes were packed with flavor. You won't be disappointed with the potatoes. Lastly, the steak.... WOW. The steak was cooked to order and very delicious. We enjoyed our dinner at Mastro's aaaaand were very thankful and appreciative of the complimentary warm butter cake dessert that was given to us to help us celebrate our anniversary.   The excellent food, attentive and friendly staff, establishment design and atmosphere make for a enjoyable dinner experience. I definitely recommend this place. It's pricey, but worth it... I say live a little and treat yourself to a nice Mastro's dinner, you won't be disappointed.",

My husband's lemon sole was over cooked and his clam chowder was just ok.  I had the tomatoes and buratta cheese.  The cheese was very good.  My lobster tails:  one baked and one in a vanilla batter were both over cooked.  We shared the Butter Cake which was good but not spectacular.  Along with this our service was horrible.  We had to ask for bread which eventually came had no butter with it.  We had a different person for each course and were totally ignored in between.  In the meantime a woman manager in a business suit and the waiter were busy fawning over the people at the next table.  Eat at Sinatra's if you want a first class meal and exceptional service.

    "text": "Yes I know I am the only person on here to give them 3 stars but please hear me out for my reasoning behind all this.   On Saturday, I had made reservations for a party of two at 730PM. When he arrived at 720PM, it was not really busy nor was it a ghost town in there. The hostess stand said it would be a moment as they got our table ready and for us to take a seat at the bar, enjoy a cocktail or two and they will get us.   During our 30 minute wait (yes maybe they were short staffed, not ready yet etc.... which I am ok with) they sat multiple tables of walk-in's and a few reservations of small 2-4 tops. (I know this because a few sat at the bar whom we spoke to and others I over heard when I stood by the hostess stand to wait to check on my table. Off to a bad start.....   Anyway, we had a nice table overlooking the garden down stairs in the back of the restaurant. All the back-waiters were very prompt and professional with regards to keeping the water glasses full, serving the bread, clearing the table from the right and serving from the left etc... (After working in this industry for years, I get picky about this crap at high end restaurants) The server was pretty on the ball and friendly but a little to relaxed with us. (Yes we are young and eating at a high end restaurant, I am ok with that)  On to the food, below is a list of what we ordered and what I thought about it:   Calamari App: Lightly breaded with light seasoning. Dipping sauce complimented it very well.   Fillet Mignon: Very tender and medium rare is more of rare. But it is better to under cook the steak then burn the hell out of it. VERY TENDER, cut with your fork status.   Sea Bass: Parmesan crusted.... a little on the very fishy side for my taste which overcame the rest of the flavors  Cream of Spinach: Very creamy and just was not my style. Girlfriend liked it though.  Sea salt/vinegar fries: These shoestring cut fries were epic! Yes.... of everything I ate, I was most impressed by the large basket of $10 fries.   Warm Butter Cake: Once again.... this was the main reason we went here for my birthday and because the other half loves this dessert more than she loves me. :)  Multiple layer chocolate birthday cake: Now to be honest, this was what saved Mastro's from getting the dreadful 2-star rating from me. In my reservation, I had noted \"birthday\" but no one had seemed to see it. Hell, we even ordered desert and were half way finished with it before they brought out the cake. Personally, did someone at the hostess stand go oops! We need to send a birthday cake over to Table XX immediately even though they already are half way through their dessert? But to be honest, they did and it truly made my otherwise mediocre dining experience in to a pleasant one.   Overall Mastros.... maybe I set my expectations to high and I understand, you have only been open for a few months now so maybe all the bugs are still getting worked out. In the words of my girlfriend, it was not as good as the Crystal Cove, CA location yet on par with the one in Costa Mesa, CA.   Sounds like I have to try all this again at the Crystal Cove location and compare! Granted.... thanks for the last minute birthday cake. It was nice to see those little comments on Open Table actually mean something.",

My server Robert was outstanding.  It's the first time I've had a waiter observe my steak after I started eating, confirm that it wasn't cooked as ordered, and offer to send it back for another, without me saying a thing.  2 days later I received a phone call from the restaurant thanking us for the visit.  That just doesn't happen anymore.",

It's one of my favorite steakhouses in Vegas and #1 choice for outstanding deserts and port wines or a glass of late harvest liquid gold (Far Niente Dolce). Made a quick reservation on Yelp and we showed up around 9:30pm. The bar was lively. I ordered one Chocolate Pudding Cake and one Cherry Crisp, plus the \"100 years flight of Port flight\" and a glass of Dolce. The dark chocolate pudding cake was warm, fresh, and delicious. The liquid cream and fresh whipped cream, serving of blackberries and mint were exceptional and we all enjoyed. The Cherry Crisp was scrumptious. Highly recommend this venue as the architecture is remarkable, service attentive and friendly (Kaitlyn was wonderful) and it's convenient to The Strip action.",

The steaks were amazing, perfectly cooked and all topped off with their truffle butter (highly recommended but an extra $15 add-on, I know. I can buy a lot of butter for $15, but worth it). Yum! Also ordered a fairly large seafood tower. It was stocked with lobster, large crab claws, oysters, crab legs. Can you say, Unbelievable! With our steaks, we ordered the following sides. Creamed spinach, mac and cheese, and the gnocci. All amazing. Obviously the price here is fairly hefty but was well worth it. Impeccable service with our waiter anticipating our every need. We ordered so much food that they ultimately comped us on a free desert. Way to go Maestros. Will most definitely come again!",

I ordered a bone in filet which was almost $60 which was fatty and undercooked (ordered medium rare).  Didn't send it back because I wasn't interested in eating more food since we had so many appetizers and we had desserts coming.

We started with the steamed mussles and bread basket. mussels were good however quite small. Bread was aldo good no complaints. I had the 18oz bone-in filet, Oscar style something I've always wanted to try.  The amount of crab meat was generous and the bernaisse sauce was good. Worth the extra $25.  My wife got the pan seared Chilean Sea Bass and it did not dissapoint. As for sides we ordered half orders of the lobster mash, green beans and the mushrooms. The amount of food was way too much for the two of us. The lobster mash was good but not worth the $18. We could've gone without it. Better off using that money to get your steak Oscar style. Much more satisfying.  Staff was professional and attentive. Drinks were really good ad well. For dessert we got a complimentary butter cake which very good but we were to stuffed at that point to really enjoy it.   I took one star away because I had my steak packed to-go for a midnight snack and when I open the box I find that there was only one piece of crab. I know I had at least 4-5 pieces left. I really wouldn't have been able to eat it all but it's the principle.  Anyway I would visit Mastro's again but order less.",

It was pretty cool to be seated there because I saw this the last time I was walking around here and had no idea it was for Mastro's. For such a nice restaurant I really expect the sea bass to be of top notch but it sadly was not. We split some sides of scalloped potatoes (everyone thought these were gross and overly salty), sauteed spinach, mushrooms, and mac & cheese. The sides are nice but none of that really matters if the main entree doesn't hit the spot.  My friend order the special \"tomahawk\" steak which is a massive piece of meat on a gimongous bone, making it look like a tomahawk - pretty awesome!",

I've had better (more garlic/butter) escargot but these were pretty good.  Lobster bisque was more than acceptable. Ocean Club salad was tasty and cold but they use iceberg lettuce (really?).  Mussels were decent.  Bone Marrow was interesting but way overpriced. Sea Bass was nice, light tasty.  Blackened grouper was pretty good.  They served both the scallops and the lamb underdone.  They promptly took both back to the kitchen and when they re-served them (just three minutes later), the scallops were acceptable but the lamb was completely awesome.  The lamb was hot with the proper amount of crust and perfectly medium rare. (Why didn't they do that the first time?) The lamb was the winner, for sure. (I glanced at other tables' filets ... too small.  It didn't look appetizing.) Brussels sprouts were delicious.  The lobster mashed potatoes were too liquidy.  What WAS that liquid?  They totally should've been thicker. For dessert (ugh, we were so full but we just HAD to have dessert) was the cherry crisp.  Tasty but needed more cherry.  The ice cream was nice and the freshly-made whipped cream was awesome.  Plenty for four people. With tip (including two drinks and everything mentioned, above) for four people, the check came to $480 (incl. $80 tip). Yes, it was overpriced but it was a fun experience, very nice service (including lots of amenities in the men's bathroom) and the food was pretty good, overall.  Not sure we'd go back (because it's so expensive) but certainly nice when you're on vacation and want to splurge a little.",

All of the wait staff was very friendly and attentive and worked together seamlessly to make our experience as pleasant as possible.  They had a moderate sized wine list with a good selection of reasonably priced bottles as well as several by the glass options.  No complaints there.  For our entree, I ordered the bone in ribeye and my wife got a filet.  This was probably my first experience at a high end restaurant where the steaks were wet aged.  My impression was unfortunately mixed.  The steaks were definitely supremely tender but they lacked that meaty punch that good dry aged steaks usually have.  Overall they tasted like a really tender version of a supermarket steak - not bad but definitely below expectations.  We got the warm butter cake for dessert which was very good.  It's big enough for 2-3 people to share though you won't want to share it.  Anyway, aside from the somewhat disappointing steaks, this was an amazing meal and experience.  We'll certainly be back next time we're in town.",

There didn't seem to be much of a dress code and the steak (Ribeye) was too fatty for our taste. We didn't want anything lean, but this was too fatty. The best side to me was the creamed corn and the clam chowder soup was the highlight of my dinner. I will say it was my first time having clam chowder. The ambiance was not exciting at all.

    "text": "3.5 stars- definitely better than 3 stars, but not quite 4.  This restaurant is location in the middle of Crystals on the Strip.  From the outside looking in, the restaurant is inside a neat sculptured \"treehouse\". It sort of made me feel like if would be cool to eat in there, but sitting on the inside of the treehouse looking out I feel a little disappointed, because I felt like I was eating in an \"upscale\" food court with views of retail stores, such as  LV, Jimmy Choo, and Zegna.  Not exactly, the scene I expected  from an expensive restaurant, however on the other side there was a piano bar.  However, service was impeccable, except we were only told the beef carpaccio was out when we ordering rather than beforehand.  In a rush we picked tuna tartare as our appetizer, husband ordered mac & cheese, we shared the chopped salad,  king crab legs and sea bass.    We ordered a bottle of Schramberg Blanc de Blanc for $70. Given it is about $27 in retail that markup isn't terrible, beside by the glass ranged from $15 to $30. The wine list is comprehensive.  I am kind of bored with tuna tartare, but it was definitely above average and the portion size of the appetizer is the size of a meal.  It is presented like a tower with the base made of crushed fried wontons, then avocado almost like guacamole, then the seasoned tuna.    The mac & cheese was a huge portion that could feed 4 people on its own or 6 side servings.  I just had to have a bite, it was creamy, cheesy and tangy all the same time; I like the addition of gorgonzola, which still remained subtle.   Definitely an adult upscale mac & cheese.   Chopped salad was solid and I like how we were told the ingredients and asked if we wanted to omit anything.  The King Crab comes warm when it is an entree and that was a bit unexpected, but tasted sweet and drowned in the drawn butter....ooooh, so good. I was surprised how meaty the 1 lb of legs were...easily filling up one person.    I love Chilean Sea Bass prepared any way, but I it was pan-fried to perfection.  The outside crusty and the inside soft and buttery. the seasoning was just salt.  The serving size is probably 8 oz, which is ample and justifies the price.  No room for dessert, but a slice of  chocolate layer cake with schlag (whipped cream) was on the house since it was my birthday.  Very generous.  Overall, pretty good, but again I couldn't get past the view which cheapened the ambiance. We left with enough food for another dinner so that was good too.  Don't know why it is called \"beach club\".  The environment doesn't in any way demonstrate a \"beach club\".  That may be a good thing, though.  Will I go again? Probably not, I think Joe's Seafood (NOT the Crab Shack) has a better ambiance and food, except the fish here is better.",

Lack of attention to detail regarding reservation and celebrating a special occasion, lame excuse for credit system not handling chase visas and overall an unappetizing experience.   As a frequent customer to Mastro's I'm annoyed by the way management is handling us as consumers due to a fraud alert on our credit card.  Very impersonal, humiliating and overall disgusting.  We did enjoy the meal but don't feel I'll ever return to any Mastro's in the near or far future.  They even told us after trying to pay that chase visas have been an issue.  AFTER eating that is....BTW the credit was fine and all resolved but treated as lepers as we leave.  HORRIBLE",

Our server Megan was extremely informative and attentive. She went through the menu and gave us some suggestions.   We ordered some drinks and they brought out the huge bread basket, which had at least 4-5 types of bread. I really liked the pretzel bread and the cheese crisps. Our server brought out our drinks, The Paloma i ordered was excellent, not over powering but had wonderful refreshing grapefruit flavor.   I ended up ordering the Oysters Rockefeller, Clear Lobster Roll and the Alaskan King Crab Gnocchi with Black Truffle. My boyfriend got the Chilean Sea Bass, wedge salad and sauteed asparagus. The oysters were juicy and full of flavor and honestly this was the best gnocchi I've ever had. It was rich and was full of crab and truffle. The lobster roll was okay, had good flavor. My boyfriend's fish was cooked perfectly and almost tasted like lobster. It went well with the asparagus and gnocchi.   Our plates were cleared and Megan brought out a dessert menu, we were way too full for dessert. However, she brought us out a little pair of chocolate covered strawberries with fresh whip cream for a little sweet treat on the house! Service was impeccable, our water glasses were always full and we were definitely catered to. Megan our server made our experience a wonderful one, I highly recommend this place for a special occasion, it's worth every penny!",

It comes in a 200 degree plate so it'll continue to cook the steak.   for sides, we had the lobster mashed potato ($39)-it was delicious, it was a bit salty for me  but my party liked it.   cream spinach-bland- i think i had better at Lawry's   Gorgonzola mac and cheese-best eat it while it's hot, once it's cold it's really bland.   the sides are generous, we order one of each  and it was more than enough for my party of 6.

The bread was delicious, the crab appetizer was also fantastic. We got the escargot and it was actually terrible. It wasn't hot and the snails didn't taste good at all. I was very disappointed, because usually its one of my favorite things to order at other fine dining restaurants. My husband ordered lamb chops and they were very good. I got the prawn special. Each prawn was 8oz. Don't order this dish. Prawns aren't suppose to be that big. They tasted like bottom feeders.   Our friends got the filet and the tuna, both were very good.   Service was good.  Dessert was good. They brought us the butter cake for our anniversary. It was delicious.   Overall it was good and management was great!!!!",

Everything was top notch, including the attentive service, the gorgeous presentation of the food, and the portions. Some of my favorites included the crab cocktail (with an abundance of crab meat), served over a bowl with dry ice, lobster bisque (creamy and with actual meat), and the black truffle crab gnocchi. I had that night's special, which was a fantastic John Dory with a chardonnay lemon sauce.   Some of the other \"little touches\" to make the experience better? The server actually served side dishes on our plates for us, and we received a follow up phone call a couple of days later to ensure our satisfaction. Very classy!  Expect a hit to your wallet: Three of us walked out of there at $600, though we did splurge on Grey Goose martinis (shaken table side), wine and lobster. I can assure you it's well worth it!",

It is located in the Crystals shopping plaza that is next to the Aria hotel. This place is really nice and you feel a little bit underdressed if you aren't in your Sunday best.   I made reservations ahead of time but the place didn't looked too packed for a Saturday night. We had a nice table an attentive waiter. We got our drinks pretty quickly and the martinis were strong.  There was some live music being heard from the lounge area near the bar area which had a nice touch to it.   I still went with the meat selection even though this was the Ocean Club. My boyfriend and I both had petite which is served on a searing hot plate. The meat continues to cook on the plate and just easily cuts like butter. The steak just melts in your mouth as the seasoning of the meat and light butter from the plate meet in your mouth, I call it Meaty Symphonic Harmony.   We also ordered the sweet potato fries as a side. This is no mere small side dish but a mound of fries is delivered. Each fry is seasoned with an almost tempura like batter on the outside that leaves you craving more and more. I was stuffed after the filet and the fries and the yummy bread basket they bring you (with warm pretzel bread and other goodies).   Dessert is something that just can't be missed and I suggest the sinful delight of the signature Warm Butter Cake and whipped cream. The butter cake is rich and heavy with deliciousness and the whipped cream is no ordinary whipped cream. It almost has the consistency of ice cream as it hits your palate.  This is my treat for the year, it is expensive so be warned but it is also a high class meal. I highly recommend it.",

Seriously, though, the Bloody Mary was excellent; it was one of those that burned your throat; being the masochist that I am, I quite enjoyed it.

The service was impeccable; water was always full, the plates and crumbs were constantly being cleared and the waiter was friendly.  Me and my wife shared the double cut porter house.  This thing was REALLY good, and was probably the best steak i've ever had at the time.  We were not even hungry and we ate half of it.

I felt way underdressed even though the staff never made me feel uncomfortable. We ordered entrees, I had some sticker shock but it's Vegas and a nice place. I got the higher end (not waygu) new York steak 16oz medium rare and sides of asparagus and butter truffle mushrooms.   The food was delicious. Every bite of steak and mushroom was a symphony of flavor. The plates are served piping hot and even my last bites were still hot. I finished the whole steak and half of the mushrooms and asparagus. The vegetable serving size is very very generous.  The staff was great, although the food took a little longer than we liked, and I had to remind my server not once, but twice about my drinks.  Had the house specialty cake dessert. Well worth it. Great way to finish up.

    "text": "Food: - special bacon appetizer (delicious) - crab cocktail (AMAZING!) - sea scallops (too salty) - sea bass (great texture, too salty) - brussel sprouts (too salty) - butter cake (very strong butter flavor)  In general, I was underwhelmed by this place. Everything was too salty and this butter cake everyone raved about was not my cup of tea. I guess I don't like butter flavor. I'd rather have a chocolate cake or key lime pie.   Service: top notch as expected.   Location: inside the mall so the ambiance is not what I'd want for the price paid. Awkward to be staring at a store from your seat.   So many other high end options available, I'd rather go to a restaurant that is not in the mall.",

Once you've eaten here your tummy will answer, Not Enough!  It was my birthday and I had so many choices so I choose Mastro's.  It was amazing from start to finish. We sat at the bar and had a drink while waiting for our table.  One of the nicest looking bars in town and they always pure 2oz drinks!  Friendly professional staff were on top of our every need.  The hostess brought us to our table in the tree house.  I couldn't have picked a better table. We had the perfect view of the tree house and ice sculptures below.  I ordered the salmon and my lady ordered the 6oz filet.  We ordered two sides as they are plentiful. The gorgonzola mac & cheese and the sweet snap pea's.  They surprised me with a butter cake topped with incredible delicious scoop of ice cream and decorated with chocolate.  Thank you for the staff for making my birthday awesome.",

Our service was exceptional, from the head waiter (Johnny) to the team that assisted. We had clients invited tonight, so it was important that everyone was left fulfilled. Mission accomplished!  We started with the seafood tower. It was a marvelous piece of art loaded with crab, oysters, lobster and shrimp. I had the crusted sea bass. Nice thick cut and very tender. Others had scallops, ribeye and grouper. Everyone was pleased. Sides were good. Very creamy mashed potatoes, followed by tasty macaroni and cheese, sauteed spinach and asparagus. Everyone at our table was pleased.   My only regret was we didn't have time to try the butter cake for dessert. We had to attend the Bruno Mars concert. (Apparently Bruno Mars ate hear a few weeks ago and really enjoyed it).   Nice ambiance. Great service. Wonderful food. Will be back soon.",

Service is provided by a small platoon of servers, yet never over intrusive.  The steaks are some of the best I have enjoyed, ever.   I would recommend to share a 8oz Kobe New York steak. And consider ordering it Med. Not the expected Med Rare. The beer fed, daily massaged fat, gets released when you cook a tad longer than normal.    The appetizers are many as are the side dishes. The garlic mashed, snap peas, lobster Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts, and Himachi all are as expected, most likely exceeding many expectations.  I would suggest to make a reservation, keep your expectations high and be surprised by the service, quality, wine list, and craft cocktails.  Great people watching as well as captivating atmosphere.  Dress is Vegas upscale. A dinner jacket is not out of place.",

I give 3.5 stars for the seared tuna (sliced thinner than any place I've ever seen), the bone in ribeye (one grain of salt away from being too salty) and the rack of lamb (charred too much on the outside).  Overall it was a good meal but I wouldn't order the lamb again. I only ate one chop and took the rest to go. The seared tuna was a huge let down too. Also, we didn't receive a complimentary desert for our anniversary despite receiving well wishes from several members of staff. It's no big deal but reading the other reviews it seems that it's generally given to everyone else celebrating. Next time we will skip the appetizers and enjoy cocktails/steak/sides.",

Last time we ordered too much and didn't have room for dessert.  This time we ordered a Mambo Salad (basically a spicy Cesar salad with a wasabi dressing), the Chilean Sea Bass, and repeated on the Rack of Lamb and the Sweet sugar peas.  For dessert we had cappuccinos and since it was the wife's birthday they gave her chocolate cake! Sweeet!  Our server Kim was great and very helpful.  Excellent suggestions on the Sea Bass and Mambo Salad and thank you for the birthday cake!  Still a five star dining experience!  Christmas Season 2016:  I love this place!  The wife and I have been here several times. The food is great. The atmosphere is unique.  Always ask to be seated in the treehouse!  Today we are here for dinner and we had the rack of lamb, the Hawaiian Big Eye Tuna and several sides.    They start with a bread basket of several types.  I personally love the pretzel bread  The lamb was medium and perfect.  A nice char on the outside and moist and tender in the inside.  Standard presentation of a lamb \"drum stick\"  The tuna was barely seared and sashimi grade; served over a bed of carrots, onions, and celery with a beer and soy sauce. Served with wasabi and ginger. Great presentation.  Sides...mac and cheese, sweet sugar peas, and the garlic mashed potatoes.  Helpful hint - they actually offer a smaller serving size on sides (not on the menu).    No room for dessert today.  5 stars as always.",

The sides we chose were Twice Baked Potato, Cream Spinach, and the Mushrooms. All delicious. The mushrooms weren't out of this world. Average.  For the third course I did the Butter Cake which was very rich and creamy. I should've asked for milk lol. My friend has the Lemoncello sorbet which was perfect! I wish I would've gotten that as it was light, refreshing, and a palate cleanser after everything we ate. Do recommend this restaurant.

The overall score is an average of all other categories with steak being counted twice, since it is a review of a steakhouse.    Overall: 4.7 Decor: 4 Bread: 5 Appetizer: 4 Filet:5 Side: 5 Dessert: 5   Mastro's is a  steakhouse located in Crystals Mall in City Center on the Las Vegas Strip.    The decor is very nice, modern, and has an open air concept inside the mall and overlooking a few of the high end stores.   The bread was excellent with a good variety of very tasty breads.   I ordered the  crab cakes as an appetizer and it was very good. For me the lump crab cake at Morton's is the gold standard but Mastro's has one of the few crab cakes that I like.    The filet mignon was excellent.   As a side I ordered a twice baked potato and it was excellent. Mastro's probably has one of the best twice baked potatoes anywhere.    For dessert I ordered the chocolate cake with the homemade whipped cream and it was excellent.    Overall, Mastro's was excellent and a great place to go for special occasions.",

Stumbled to the mall center and noticed the beautiful dome decor of this restaurant. Load of people at 9:15pm. So Yes, I'm going to give this a try.  Hostess offered a table or the bar, bar it is. Great bartenders and service throughout the hour. What did I ordered: mussels, bone-in filet; tomato and onion; foie gras and scallops!  I finished half and box-away the rest. Buuuuurp. Belvedere tonic with extra lime and a glass of Pinot as the chaser.  Not bad at all... headed to more (buzzed) shopping afterwards =)",

The sauteed shrimp is to die for until the last piece of garlic bread hits your palette. Truly a meal unto itself. You only get three shrimp but they're huge and ridiculously delicious. We probably should've stopped there but of course we didn't. We don't live close so we went for the gusto. We finished with Truffle butter mushrooms, lobster mashed potatoes and Chilean sea bass cooked two different ways. And last but not least, the famous butter cake. This is not the place to skip dessert trust me. What a treat this was. Do yourself a favor and make the reservation.",

The Tree House is open throughout and allows for maximum people watching.  Water and a bread basket appeared in a few minutes after seating. George, our server welcomed us and described the specials of the day. Service is not rushed with ample time to enjoy cocktails. We ordered the Petite Filet 8 oz, twin Lobster Tails 7 oz each, Double Baked Potato and Roasted Brussels Sprouts. The Filet was tender and juicy which sometimes is difficult to achieve when ordered well done. A great job by the chef. The Lobster Tails with a side of melted butter was excellent, melt in your mouth joy. We shared the Potato and the Brussels Sprouts. The large size of the potato and the quantity of sprouts were large enough for four people. The sprouts were nicely charred to perfection. Dessert was a complementary birthday Butter Cake with a large bowl of fresh cream on the side. It was the perfect finale to a wonderful meal.  Service throughout was spot on. George checked on us periodically and the wait staff worked as a team in refilling water glasses and removing empty dishes on a timely basis.   Parking is complimentary when using the Crystals Valet parking service",

I was recommended Mastro's by a friend who lives in Vegas, so I decided to dine here on a Saturday evening. Reservations were a breeze to make online.   For a starter, we tried the bone marrow which was unreal. One of the best I've ever tried and I've had bone marrow prepared a few different ways. The bone marrow also comes with a side salad with a light vinaigrette dressing and capers which was a nice extra.   The main courses consisted of the seafood tower (this is totally customizable) and the alpine steak. The seafood was so fresh, my favorite was the east coast oysters. The steak cut like butter and was massive, plenty for two people to split. I highly recommend adding a side of the truffle butter mushrooms to top the steak with.   For dessert... BUTTER CAKE. Just do it. Amazing!   Next trip to Vegas, skip the branded steak joints and hit Mastro's.",

Yeah, you will pay for it too. But you will know where your money went.   I had a chopped salad to start. The bartender (I sat at the bar) suggested I might be happy with a half salad. I appreciated the suggestion. He was right. It was plenty and very good. Next I had the boneless 18 oz ribeye with fries. He suggested a smaller fries order. Same thing -- he was right. I like medium rare steak but I always think medium rare is too red in many restaurants. He suggested medium rare plus. They nailed it. Then I had dessert. I like profiteroles but only when made with ice cream, no cream filling crap. They really get it right -- dark chocolate and vanilla bean ice cream. They come 5 to an order but he suggested two instead. They were huge and it was more than enough.    When I want to be sure my steak is going to be excellent, I go here (or SW Steakhouse). You won't be sorry.",

You have to get it with the truffle butter. I must say the service & food was spot on. Our waiter Johnny was very pleasant we had a more enjoyable dinner.

The interior is also clean and gives you a comfort feel. The steaks here are priced as what you would expect at a fancy steakhouse. The sides were also priced slightly high with the cocktails. We shared the 40z Waygu Tomahawk Chops (Snake River Farms). My other friend got the filet mignon and the bone in ribeye. The Tomahawk was pretty tasty and cooked perfectly.  The sides I had were also tasty - I liked the cream corn, truffle butter sauteed wild mushrooms, and scalloped potatoes. The service here is great as you would expect from this establishment.

A small size is enough for 2 people. It's very rich. But tastes fantastic eith the fresh whipped cream. So happy our waiter suggested it.

Mastro's tries to drown this out by playing their music very loudly, which is also not consistent with fine dining.  My date and I arrived on time for our reservation at 6 pm.  We ordered steaks and split a Caesar salad.  We got our salad promptly, and then we waited.  At about 6:45, our waiter said he would check on our entree's, but he didn't come back with an update.  At 6:55, I asked our waiter to check again.  By this time, people next to us who had also ordered steak were finishing up their meal.  The food came at 7:00, exactly an hour after we had arrived.  The steak was too hot to eat, still, (which means the kitchen did not let the meat rest the requisite 8 or so minutes before serving), and I burned my mouth on the first bite.  Once my steak cooled off, it was tender and had a very good flavor, but my dining experience was basically shot.  At $63 per steak, I expect the total package to be much better than it was.  I won't go back there.",

EVERYTHING wasa absolutely delicious, and the staff is as professional as they come.  Unfortunately for me, after this visit, I fell ill.  I have no reason to believe it was because of Mastro's, but when they called to follow up on my dining experience, I told them, in the event others had also had issues.  They assured me they had not been aware of issues, but would talk to their chef, just in case.  They followed up with two more phone calls that rang True of genuine concern.  I live in the Chicagoland area and had no idea they had a restaurant in Chicago as well - if not for their phone calls, I may not know for a long time.  Class act, all the way around.",

We shared an order of the tempura shrimp for an appetizer, I had the twin lobster tails, my boyfriend had the new york strip and we shared a side of the creamed spinach. Wow, wow, wow is all I can say.

We went with the live lobster table side shelled by Tanya and the bone in fillet.  Lobster cooked to perfection (not over cooked) and steak was so tender it cut with a fork.  Drinks and sides were also wonderful...house special lemon drop, crab and truffle gnocchi, twice baked potato and mushrooms.  WOW!  High end Vegas at its best.  Shops with million dollar dresses in the window surround and live \"Vegas style entertainment\" abounds.  Definitely highly recommended (and the ONLY five star review I've even written on Yelp!).*  *((edit: ok at the time the only fiver I had given...found you need to do fives sometimes to bring up the average from the unwashed...sorry to be misleading in anyway ';-))",

    "text": "Can I just start off by saying, THIS specific Mastro's set the bar for all future fine dining for me.  We were in Vegas for my boyfriend's birthday and knowing that he loves steak, I got us a reservation at Mastros after seeing the high reviews. I left a little note with my reservation on Open Table stating that it'll be my boyfriend's birthday and requested to be seated in the tree house. We got everything we wanted and more!!  First off, we got there about 5-10 minutes early but the hostesses seated us right away. They even greeted him happy birthday and sparked a lovely conversation with us while walking us to our table. She was so friendly and made us feel comfortable knowing that it was our first time dining with them.   When we were seated, our waitress (whom I wish I remembered her name because she was simply the greatest) got us all settled with drinks and everything. She too greeted my boyfriend happy birthday and went on to tell us her recommendations since we were new to their menu. My boyfriend jumped at hearing the tomahawk steak so we went with that for him. Me, I'm not really a steak person but I really wanted to try their lobster mashed potatoes and their king crab black truffle gnocchi. I couldn't choose between the two so she said they can split half/half for me and make it an entree. Ahh, she made life so much easier! After we placed our orders, my boyfriend realized that he wanted some sides since his plates was just going to be a huge hunk of meat. So we asked her if we can add some sauteed mushrooms and spinach if it wasn't too late. She made it happen!   While we were waiting for our food, all the passing waiters or hosts all greeted my boyfriend happy birthday. We were so shocked cause damn, they made him feel like a king! Everyone knew it was his birthday and they made him feel super special, which I lovedddd. Our food came out after what seemed like barely 5-10 minutes, so quick! We didn't really hear her when she described how big the tomahawk was.. But when it came out, it was a huge 30-33 ounce steak..LOL . He devoured that thing till he couldn't any longer. Every bite melted in our mouths, it was delicious! They placed all the sides on our plates one by one, making us feel like royalty! Everything was delicious!!! They even brought him out a complimentary birthday cake and offered to take pictures for us. Overall, I was so mind blown by the superb service we had that night. My bf said I won best girlfriend of the year award for this dinner. (;  Expensive? Yes. But it was worth every penny!! I will definitely be coming back every time I'm in Vegas!",

My biggest complaint was the service of our waitress...she literally rushed us like I've never been rushed before and I was born and raised in NYC...I was chewing my so- called \"vanilla\" shrimp when she brought out our steaks... with our appetizer plates still half full...

    "text": "WOW I was pretty impressed with this place and I've done my share of dining in Vegas. The decor was modern and in the middle had this treehouse area where there are more tables. That night, they happened to have the treehouse rented out so there was live music playing which got a bit annoying since it was loud. That was my main complaint.   On to the food. We started with the seafood tower and I wasn't even hungry going into this dinner but I gobbled everything up. It had jumbo shrimp cocktail, kunumoto oysters, crab claws, lobster, and king crab legs, the works. It was presented with dry ice. They served it with cocktail sauce, this mustard sauce and atomic horseradish, when you mix all 3 it was a pretty good sauce that way too.   I was pretty full so I opted to get a salad and I chose the iceberg salad. Now I have to say i always get dressings on the side but this dressing was a red wine vinaigrette but it was creamy looking. The waitress said it was emulsified but there was no cream in it. It was the BEST salad dressing I have ever had! I think i wanted to dip every lettuce in a spoonful of dressing, that's how much I liked it.  It just had this tangy taste (from the red wine) but a smooth creamy texture but it had no creme. YUM!  I tried my bf's steak and he had the rib eye and it was delicious, melt in your mouth meat. Our favorite steak houses in Vegas are Michael's (Southpoint) and Cut (Palazzo) but I think Mastro's takes the cake on this. We had so many sides, potato's au gratin, snow peas, yam fries, mac and cheese but I heard the gnocci here was delicious from the rest of our party although I was too stuffed to try.   But the best part of dinner was the dessert! We had the warm butter cake, it tasted like a mix of pound cake and maybe cheesecake but it is served with vanilla ice cream and had a creamy inside, and sugar flakes line the cake to give it texture. Oh and it comes with homemade whip cream! I think that was better than the ice cream, I wanted to eat gobs of it.   This is definitely a favorite now although the seafood tower is VERY pricey, it was probably half of the price of the meal, and we were with a party of 10. n",

It is located on the second floor that looks like a wooden Aladdin lamp.    The ambiance was great.  It was comfortable, cozy, and had live music.  The food was pretty awesome.  I ordered the cowboy ribeye cut bone in steak.  It's the second largest steak on the menu.  It is probably by far the best cut of steak I've had.  It was tender, soft, and juicy.  The potatoes au gratin was alright.  Next time I am going to try the lobster mashed potatoes.  The bread they serve is pretty impressive.  You actually get a bread basket full of different assortment of bread.  There is pretzel bread, wheat, white, bread sticks, and others that I can't recall right now.  Tasted like it was freshly baked that day.  The service is the reason why I gave this place 5 stars instead of 4.  Our server was outstanding.  He was pretty knowledgeable about the food.  Helped me make up my mind on what I want right away.  Didn't give me too much info where it would confuse me (it doesn't take much to confuse me).  He checked up on us every now and then to see how we were doing on our meal.  He asked if we wanted to order dessert.  We declined because we were stuffed like a turkey at a thanksgiving dinner.  So we politely asked for the bill.  So our server brought us back a raspberry sorbet with our bill.  It was on the house and and he said he couldn't let us go without having dessert to complete our wonderful meal.  How cool was that!? I am not a sorbet fan, but I still take a few bites cause I'm a fatass.  I recommend to go and enjoy the food, but I will return because of the service.",

Parts of the escargot was cold and tasted like dirt. It was obviously frozen and not cleaned well. Just to let you know this is not our first time eating escargot, it's one of our favorite dishes, so we've had it plenty of times. As for the entrees we got the swordfish, which was extremely dry and tasteless. We also got the seabass, which was over cooked and the filet steak which was over chard. It was very disgusting! Very disappointed in the food.  How can we tell our server that all of the food that came out was disgusting. We didn't want to make a scene so we just ate what we could, paid and left. Our first and last time ever going there. The price that you pay for the food, it was definitely not worth it. We've had 100 times better. Mastro definitely topped the list for the worst expensive restaurant in Vegas. Definitely will not be returning. Great service but horrible food. Don't waste your time and money.",

    "text": "The were some definite pros and cons at Mastros.   The service was top notch, very impressed. Sat on the edge of the tree house area, prime spot.   Had lemon drop martinis throughout the night, they are served with dry ice so it appears as tough there's smoke coming from the bottom. Very nice, cool experience!  Ordered bone marrow and 3 MASSIVE shrimp for an appetizer (served with dry ice as well). The bone marrow comes with bread, I had never had it before but since everyone raved I thought I would give it a try...it was very good but I don't know what the hype is all about, in general---it's just a delicacy? The shrimp were delicious but I was not a fan of the cocktail sauce...waaaay too strong for me.   Ordered the lobster tail, not impressed at all. However, if you like a smoky taste on seafood, then by all means, order it. I was not a fan in the least, very disappointed. For sides I had the Gorgonzola mac & cheese and chic peas. Both are buttered to perfection, definitely worth the fat and calories.   I also happened to go on my birthday so they surprised me with their Butter Cake (with ice cream and whipped cream) everyone couldn't stop talking about and OMG I completely understand why. I would have never chosen to order it but I can say, with confidence, that this is hands down one of the tastiest, most well made desserts I have ever eaten. You have not lived until you try it.",

The food was good but not great blow your sox off.  We had crab legs (a little dry) and halibut also overcooked and dry.  Both had an ok taste however.  The tuna jalapeno appetizer was quite tasty and the serving size was nice too.  It was a great experience but I am not sure the meal matched the price.",

For our entree we had shared the wagyu tomahawk steak with gorgonzola mac n cheese and creamed corn. For a tomahawk given it's size it was actually cooked quite well at a medium rare. The creamed corn was actually the best I've ever had so buttery and creamy felt totally decadent! Service was excellent and personal. We went with our 2 young kids and the staff took care of us all. Will definitely go back to try other things on the menu!",

Gavin Degraw was also eating at the restaurant that night and shared the same feedback on the Caesar salad.    3. Steak is the reason that this rating is 4 stars instead of 5.  We have had far better steak at Craftsteak. But the side of mushrooms that you can order with the steak is sooo good!  4. Butter cake was a great dessert but there chocolate cake was very dry.  Both you could share with someone else.  5. The lemon drop is one of the best I have ever had.  I will order it every time I am in Vegas. The wine list is also reasonable and has a lot of good choices.",

Plenty of crab meat! 3) Gorgonzola Mac n Cheese was outstanding 4) lobster mash potatoes was good but nothing special except the few pieces of lobster added to it 5) snap peas are in season and always worth ordering 6) rack of lamb was cooked to perfection and I really enjoyed it 7) can't leave Mastro's without ordering some butter cake:) 8) Mr Michael provided us with exceptional table service:)",

    "text": "I read all these great reviews and I just don't get it.  I've eaten at the Beverly Hills location on several occasions and LOVED it.  I've tried on many occasions to duplicate the Tomatoes and Onions at home, but never the same.  I've been in Vegas 4 years now, and never knew that this was here until about 3 weeks ago.  It was so beautiful that i couldn't wait to try it.  Since it was my birthday, I said \"Lets go to Maestros.\"   Why am I the only person to have a bad experience here?  The waiters and bussers were waiters and bussers, no personality at all, but thats not what i went for, so no issue there.    I wanted the Tomatoes and Onions.  When the server sat the plate down, i asked \"Those are sweet onions, right?\"  He replied \"Yeah!\"  They were not. Three slices of tomato and 2 slices of a regular onion that you would put on a hamburger, burned the inside of the nose.  Calimari was very good.  We both ordered the 22 oz bone in rib eye, mine medium rare, my guest Medium, with a few sides:  Gargonzola Mac & Cheese (Pretty damn good), sauteed spinach, and Burnt Brussel Sprouts, which they were.  When they sat the plate down, the steaks looked like they were for Fred and Barney, and they tasted that old.  These were the worst steaks that I've ever had.  I sawed (literally) a piece off of each end and could not go any further. A chainsaw wouldn't help. The taste was like that of a 30 year old cow.  My asked asked \"Does yours taste like an old cow?\"  \"CLEARLY!\"  The busser asked if we wanted everything to go:  I said \"Sure, but please place this steak in a separate box\", as i intended to give it to one of the homeless people on the bridge.  When he heard us discussing how awful the meat was, busser told us that he could put it on the grill a little longer.  I told him that that wouldn't help it.  So, He boxed it up and the waiter gave us the check.  NO ONE (Manager, waiter, etc...) ever asked, from the time that the steak was sat down, \"How is it?\".  At Del Friscos, or Hugos Cellar, or descent restaurants they always say \"Please cut into the center and let us know if that is prepared correctly\", before they ever walk away.  I guess that they are tired of seeing the sawing action. After Paying, waiter said \"Till next time\" to which my guest replied \"there wont be a next time!\"  Trust me, I really wanted this to be an awesome experience, as it was my birthday, the place is BEAUTIFUL, and it took some talking to get my guest to go with me.  Check was only $250, but $130 of that was a total waste.  I could NEVER go to this place again, not even for free.",

I would like to say that I went a little overboard with the whole pound of steak. The 12 oz would've sufficed.  We had a side of lobster mashed potatoes. Mashed potatoes were really creamy and the lobster blended well with the gravy. Overall, I felt it was a decent side. Don't know why people keep raving about it.  We had sauteed mushrooms for our second side. These were very juicy and well flavored. Mushrooms and steak make an amazing combination.

This is not the place if you are on a budget but a great place for the special occasion.    Even with all of the choices in Las Vegas Mastro's is always at the top of our list.",

My boyfriend and I shared the mussels as an appetizer and were both really impressed with the flavor and freshness. I also loved all the little garlic crustinis that we're everywhere in the sauce. For dinner I ordered twin lobster tails which my server nicely de-shelled for me table side. My boyfriend ordered a steak special - wagyu beef which he loved.

We came here to celebrate my husband's birthday and we made reservations a couple of weeks prior. When we got there, the hostesses were not only rude to the patrons, but also rude to each other.  They were talking back to each other, rolling their eyes and just plain unpleasant.   The servers were great to the patrons, but we were sitting pretty close to the kitchen/bar and could hear the conversations of the servers and management and could tell that they just don't get along well. That made the experience a little bit of a downer.   As far as the food, I was just so disappointed!!!! Talk about the biggest let down ever! We spent about $300 on everything and it was not worth it.   First course was the Clear Lobster Rolls which were ok but we could get better sushi for less elsewhere. We also got the tuna sashimi, also good but had too many sesame seeds.  Second course was the clam chowder which was really good! The part that upset me though was when our main course arrived, I was still eating the soup, but then they took my soup away mid-bite and didn't even ask if I was still eating or not.   Our main courses were the twin lobster tails, which were really salty. My husband got the Chilean sea bass which was pretty dry but my husband said the flavor was good, but since it was dry, it felt kind of dense. We also got the mushrooms and lobster mashed potatoes. Both were delicious and seasoned well.   All in all, we will probably never go back again. The only good thing was that they did give my husband a complimentary cake for his birthday. We enjoyed the cake and the cream that came on the side.  Average food, mediocre service for a really high price. Not good.",

My friends and I had to restrain ourselves from devouring two baskets of bread so we won't be too full for our meal.  We ordered a Caesars salad split between three people, but it didn't come out until AFTER our meal and sides came. I didn't think that was very professional, but everyone makes mistakes.   We got the cream corn and lobster mashed potatoes for our sides. They were both to die for! I ordered the sauteed scallops which were delicious but a little too salty for my taste. My two friends ordered the filet mignon and the bone-in ribeye, which they loved.   We also ordered two bottles of the Argyle Pinot noir, which our server recommended for us. It was wonderful.. Not too sweet, not too dry.   We also informed our waiter that it was our friend's birthday, so at the end of our meal, they brought out an amaaaazing butter cake with a candle!   Overall, the experience was great, especially sitting in the nest! Lol",

    "text": "So let me first start off by saying I don't eat seafood. At all. Allergies make life fun.   With that in mind, I'd actually be giving this place a 4/5, but I can't say that as everyone came out very happy, including myself. The only drawback I had was the steak, an 18oz NY Strip on the bone that was nothing particularly special, but definitely adequate. When I say adequate, I mean a steak I'd expect to get at a mom and pop 'steakhouse' in the midwest, not one of the nicer places in Las Vegas.   Mastro's has one of the coolest locations in Las Vegas. The exterior bar in the Crystal Shops is flanked by retailers like Audmers Piguet, Tom Ford and Richard Mille....I mean, its hard to walk into the restaurant when so many cool shops are right next to it....but hey, that's neither here nor there. It actually has nothing to do with the review, I just love watches. Actually, the interior design probably plays into other people's reviews, so...uh...idk, 5/5? Would interior decorate appreciate again?  The staff was amazingly attentive, down to Earth and incredibly good at their jobs. I was incredibly impressed with the knowledge of the somm, and our waiter was very, very good at his job.   Everyone got appetizers, the foie gras was incredibly good...and I foolishly shared with another at the table. Given the portion was like 2 bites in total, I got one. Still damn good.   Dinner came; steak was decent, potato was...well, a potato...hard to do anything with a simple starch that would be categorized as amazing, but it was an overall good meal. Everyone at the table raved about their seafood though, like...they loved the place.   If you're still reading this, ha. But yeah, I personally think 4/5 due to 'meh' steak, but overall I'd definitely come back for the great staff, great location and great wine list.",

My favorite tables are located within the \"tree house\" because who doesn't want to be in a tree house? =)  I've been there a bunch of times and below are some of my favorite food items: - Alaskan King Crab Legs - (Available by the pound) Comes out warm and ready to eat with the shells already cracked open. They serve it with melted butter but I prefer their cocktail sauce instead. - Cocktail Sauce - Yes, I put this in it's own category LOL. It's AMAZING. This is the best cocktail sauce I have ever had. It has the perfect amount of kick. - Shrimp Cocktail - huge, plump, and delicious! One order includes 3 shrimps. It comes out in an entertaining presentation because of the dry ice below the bed of ice. - Dungeness Crab Cocktail - This is probably the best value for the seafood tower appetizers. You get a bunch of crab meat with a few different sauces: cocktail (again, its the best!), Mastro's mustard, and extra horse radish (super strong).  - Bone-In Rib Eye - They seem to cook a little more on the rare side. Possibly because the plate comes out at 400 degrees. (Be careful!) The meat tastes fabulous alone but they do offer Bearnaise and Peppercorn sauce as an option. - Sea Scallops - Perfectly cooked and savory (Appetizer portion has 3, Entree portion has 5.) - Signature Warm Butter Cake - THIS IS THE BEST DESSERT EVER!!!! Warm butter cake topped with a scoop of vanilla ice cream and served with a huge side of whipped cream. It is quite large and well worth the price! Serves 3-4 people easily.   The service is genuine and attentive. If you put any notes in your reservation such as a special celebration, they pay close attention to it. It was so nice to not worry about telling the server it was my boyfriend's birthday.  I know I listed a bunch of my favorites, but if you could take away anything from this review, TRY THE BUTTER CAKE! =)",

We ordered a wagyu steak that was over $100 and it was served well done although we asked for MEDIUM RARE. The manager treated us like peasants when we brought this to his attention, walked away before we found a resolution, and ignored us for over 15 minutes following the encounter. They then brought us an ice cold steak to try to resolve the situation. I unfortunately had a client dinner here next week with my CEOs but I will have to cancel because I cannot take a business risk.",

The service all night was outstanding, water glasses never got less than half empty.  We all ordered apps, salad/soups, main course and dessert.  The escargot was great, very garlicky and the sauteed shrimp were excellent.  The Caesar salad was good, but you could really taste the anchovy, if you don't like anchovies, stay away.   I had a bone in filet and it was the best, most melt in your mouth steak I have ever had.  All the steaks, sea bass, scallops and lobster were great.  The only critique I have is that my father's rack of lamb was quite under done.  We should have sent it back, but he refused.  Overall, a great place for fine dining, bring your $$$$.",

    "text": "Very few restaurants I've ever eaten in has ever left me walking away so satisfied feeling that they couldn't possibly top themselves... except Mastro's. From being ushered into the beautifully unique wooden architecture aka the \"Treehouse\" that housed the restaurant, to the exceptional service and, being, overall, treated like royalty, my party of three had pretty much felt that we had eaten at the best restaurant in Las Vegas.   Nestled aesthetically inside the Crystals at the City Center besides Aria Hotel, Mastro's was incorporated within the shopping center, in the midst of luxury brand names: Vuitton, Zegna, Cartier, et al. The most striking feature of the restaurant was how the interior of the restaurant is actually built into a structure that resembled a treehouse skeleton, with no solid walls in the main dining room. This monstrosity emerged from the ground floor and grew at least eight stories into the air and eventually flowing symbolically into the ceiling.   The dining experience was superb. Highly attentive, the staff reminded me of 3-Michelin star restaurants but at much lower prices and with sense of humor that made it fun and even more memorable. The maitre d', well-dressed in a fine suit, was always attentive over the entire dining space like a hawk and was quick to address diners' requests. Our waiter was especially quirky and cracked a few tongue-in-cheek jokes that were appropriate for our young, lively group.  As for the quality, it was on par with most upscale restaurants. Steaks were delivered in juicy perfection. The incorporation of seafood into potato dishes were noteworthy, especially the crab gnocchi and lobster mac and cheese. There wasn't anything else the chef could've done to improve these dishes.  These were the items selected by our table:  Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi *** Roasted Brussels Sprouts ** Lobster Mashed Potatoes *** Bone-In Filet ***12oz Filet ***12oz Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese *** Clam Chowder **  *   don't bother **  average/good enough *** exceptional  Not realizing that we had ordered more than enough food for our small party, we opted to take the rest home, which the waitstaff briskly took care of and within minutes, returned with all of the food packaged in their own individual black to-go boxes with the Mastro's sticker label affixed to the top and neatly arranged in a shopping bag.   Bathrooms were supplied with an assortment of items found in medicine cabinets had personal effects like Tums, men's cologne and mouthwash and someone to hand you a paper towel to dry your hands with. Again, Michelin-star quality without the Michelin-star price.   Best $350 spent in Vegas. Worthwhile for a beautiful night out to impress your significant other, client or, perhaps, to just have the best fine dining experience in Sin City.",

Our main course was delayed for some reason & I was really unimpressed by my steak. It was good steak, but it was a bit dry and tasted like it had sat under a warmer while someone forgot to tell the expo guy. My wife's Lobster was overcooked and dry. We actually sent it back which is rare for me.   All in all our meal was good, but not 5 star in my opinion.",

However I do think the seafood appetizer though delightfully displayed, was just \"I've had better.  The service was cool, although the group I was with had built that up something fierce, and it was a bit lacking from the time they had been there before. If you really want great service, check out the Chilis in Layton, Ut.  This is not joking, that is some fine service. They will never let your drink go empty, a mistake Mastro's made.",

Of course you can't just stop at the dinner you have to order s butter cake for dessert. I don't know how or what they do to make this cake so moist and buttery but it's addicting. The butter cake also comes with home made whipped cream made in house. My boyfriend loves their bone in New York steak 22 0Z it's so big. The complimentary bread basket is a nice touch also you get different varieties of bread while waiting for your food. I recommend getting your steak butterflied and well done. The steak always comes out on a hot plate sizzling. Maestros is becoming a Friday or Saturday date night habit for me and my boyfriend. We always get Stephen as our server he rocks he's so awesome. He's taken a nectar note of what we like and always remembers how we like it prepared. He's the best server hands down. For drinks I recommend the lemon drop martini it comes out ice cold and has smoke on top and it bubbles and makes a crackling sound. My boyfriend drinks the Maestros Margarita. The ambiance is beautiful we always request to sit in the dining area which is inside this beautiful caged area over looking the crystals mall attached to Aria. If you haven't tried Maestros you are in for a major treat. It's pricey but worth it. You. Any put a price on good quality food and service.",

    "text": "I have been to the Mastro's in Los Angeles and when I saw the Ocean Club at the City Center in Las Vegas - I have to say I was a bit taken a back. Do not get me wrong reader - here is this amazing bird's nest modern structure that looks like it should be in a museum somewhere....nested in a MALL. Given the shops were all upscale. But still, a MALL to say the least. It had that new mall smell that you'll just never get out of your clothes. It left me wondering what the restaurant and atmosphere would be like during dinner service. Well, I didn't have to wonder. My group had planned a bachelorette dinner for the lucky bride to be.   Staff - These people are pros. Seriously, every person works together like a well oiled machine. We had a group of nine girls, which is not easy but I'm sure they see that pretty often. It is Vegas. And the service was fantastic. Our waiter and the whole wait staff was really great and accommodating. Our reservations were at 745pm and we had to be out of there by 915pm to catch our ride. They were so mindful of that the whole time, but also didn't take away from the experience.   The meal - What can I say about the food that has not already been said? Pretty much nothing - so I'll just reinforce what my fellow yelpers have been saying the whole time - it's amazing. I ordered the salmon and one of the other girls ordered a fillet and we shared both plates. Both cooked perfectly. For sides - Lobster mashed potatoes, regular mashed potatoes and asparagus. All delicious.   The whole experience was wonderful. And I had serious reservations about what this was going to entail when I walked in. But Mastro's did not disappoint. I enjoyed stepping back and being able to compare my experience in LA to Vegas. And although each restaurant had their similarities whether it be with the menu or just how the staff serves you, both restaurants still had a their own uniqueness which made each experience stand out.",

You are really paying extra in exchange for the privilege of eating your dinner inside of a giant, 3-D artist's rendition of a tree house.  It's still pretty good though.  I got the big bone-in fillet, creamed spinach, and club house salad.  The house salad has shrimps and crab in it.  It's quite good.  The warm butter cake is OK.  I thought the grain was coarse and the flavor was just \"yellow\".  I dunno, it's just not as good as everyone keeps saying.  But I still gave it four stars for the architecture.",

We ordered mussels, vanilla battered shrimp, sauteed sea scallops and sushi sea bass ponzu. The ponzu was excellent lightly fried and tender. Battered shrimp also was nicely flavored. Main course was blackened sea bass. Grilled sea bass was very flavorful. Sides w French fries, sauteed spinach, desert was also fantastic. Warm buttered cake was a great way to finish the meal.

Seated in the neat tree house, Shady and Co. started with some seared Ahi tuna, well presented and delicious. Shady and lucky guest split the bone in ribeye and the crusted Halibut special and side of roasted sprouts. The steak and brussel sprouts were spot on. The Halibut was a touch disappointing, undercooked in spots and with no real oomph in the flavor. The dessert had to be the signature warm butter cake. Big enough for 8, Shady and friend got 1/3 through and called it quits. The creme fraiche was outstanding and the cake as good as advertised. But why so huge? Service was very good, and the vibe very enjoyable. Shady always have reservations ordering fish in Las Vegas, and next time will stick with what Shady thinks is their forte-the meats. 3.5 stars.",

    "text": "My first thought when seated was, \"It's a good thing all of these world class stores aren't doing any business because it sure takes the edge off a high-dining experience along the mall food court railing\". Our table felt like a satellite location for a sparkling contemporary version of daddy's classic steak house. And we weren't even seated in the satellite (you'll get it if you visit). It just seemed surreal for a \"room\" with such distinguishing attributes. I won't hold that against them, much.  It was just my son and I that visited to celebrate his 21st. Matt was our dining guide and he was fun. Not like, \"let's have a Vegas night!\", fun. Just that he carried his demeanor well and kept his smile on. He was very, very consistent in that his presentation to each of the three tables nearby was identical, and specific. He was meticulous to ensure accuracy and satisfaction.  We were completely impressed by the young lady and gentleman entertaining the room. We later learned that it was their first night at Mastro's. Their acoustics in that challenging environment are absolute perfection and their talents are superior.    We went light on the openers which were supplemented by an abundant variety of stellar bread choices. My son is All-American in his need for a Calamari appetizer. It was the best we'd ever had, and maybe will. I had the Ocean Club Salad and, again, maybe the best complete salad I've ever enjoyed. My son ordered the Bone-In KC Strip a little less than medium and he dubbed it The Crown Jewel of his steak experiences. He couldn't finish it and he finishes everything. I asked for the Bone-In Ribeye. Matt helped me herd descriptives into a perfectly cooked finish. I'm still thinking it's the fact that I live in Colorado, where even onions and garlic sometimes have difficulty offering flavor, but if it's possible to have too much natural flavor in a steak, it happened. I'm taking accountability on that one, because it's not Mastro's fault I live at high altitude. This was a huge steak and I hardly dented it. We sided up a strong contender for best garlic mashed, which we carried out more of than we ate. So we get this this lovely shopping bag, consistent with the elevated neighborhood, to carry our midnight snack down the strip with.   I have so many reasons to go 5 star all over this place and fractions of thoughts about why I wouldn't. Those fractions, the bulk of which are carried by the food court railing ambiance, add up to one. And I won't insult Matt because I liked him.  When I return in May, I might just take the other half of the family because I can't go wrong on this one.",

Service is super fast and super efficient. The kind of service I want when I go to Denny's. Not when I'm trying to enjoy a nice dinner. Like I said efficient but very rushed but I guess that is to be expected in Las Vegas! We split a filet and two lobster tails, sauteed asparagus and mushrooms, I had a bowl of lobster bisque. Asparagus was whatever, mushrooms were tasty, steak was perfect , lobster was too salty and not really fresh. Same with the bisque, it had a slight fishy odor. Lots of lobster and the flavor was good just not FRESH. Again, it's the desert so what did I expect? This was my first Mastro's experience, and while I wasn't disappointed, I wasn't too impressed. Satisfied. I would try the Beverly Hills location, but not again in Vegas.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I took a whole week vacation off to visit the West coast. It was our first time trip to visit Las Vegas, and the entire experience was amazing and unforgettable. Amid the many alluring performing shows, the endless eyes-dazing slot machines, and the gigantic resorts were some of the most fantastic restaurants that Vegas could offer.   We first passed by OC while exploring the riches on the famed Strip. It was located within the beautiful Crystal. Upon seeing it, both of us were intrigued by the outstanding artistry presented by the original designer. The structure's frames were made out of steel and covered with fine, deep red wood. Between the frames were giant crystal clear glasses that allowed a perfect view from both within and out. However, the most salient and attracting feature was that the entire structure was slanted. My words would be lacking and limited for the description, but just imagine an hourglass tilted like a forward-slash sign. Bemused by its charm, we booked a table on a Monday night and dressed in proper attires, girlfriend in a beautiful orange-red dress.  We arrived around 10pm after seeing the fantastic Le Reve at Wynn. Being Monday night, the restaurant had only a few tables occupied. We were given a table near the crystal glasses, which allowed an excellent view for the outside. Our waitress of the night was very friendly and polite. As she went slowly on explaining the menu she also told us that the structure was called \"The Tree\", its name inspired by the tiny leaves spurting out of the joints of the steel frames. From the menu, we picked \"Dungeness Crab Cocktail\" and \"Vanilla Batter Shrimp\" for appetizers, a \"Fillet of Arctic Char Oreganate\" with \"Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi\" as entree and side dish. The crab cocktail came in a special tall glass container filled with mist giving dry ice. Each large lumps of crab meat was tender and fresh with the saltiness and sweetness of the ocean. The vanilla fried shrimps were gigantic in size, each crispy on the outside and tender within, a must try for shrimp lovers. The arctic char was perfect, cooked to medium-rare the way I loved. It was a huge fillet more than enough for the two of us to share. The Oreganate style was foreign to me, but the combination of butter, spices, and bread crumbs had made a wonderful sauce suited well with the fish. The gnocchi was huge in portion, baked in large hot skillet and filled with delicious cheese and crab meat. The mix of crab meat, cheese, and truffle gave the dish an unique and saliva dripping aroma. However, due to the large portion, over-stuffing this huge amount of cheese, crab meat and gnocchi is not recommended. You would need to trust me on this, as the first 5 bites would have you mouthwatering for more, but double that you would start having the too-much-cream-stuck-in-your-stomach feeling, and beyond that would be just too much to handle.  Alas, at the end, gf and I had to pick out the delicious crab meat along with the truffle to eat and wasted a large amount of the gnocchi.  Regrettably, since we were on a tight schedule for a night club to visit, we skipped the desserts - What a shame! Dinning at Ocean Club was such a wonderful experience. My gf and I enjoyed every minute from beginning to end. Yes, it was a very expensive place, but so was everything else in Vegas and every penny spend was well worth it. So by chance if you ever stop by Vegas, be sure to checkout this amazing restaurant.",

The Scallops are in a butter sauce that I could drink! Thankfully they serve the dish with bread to soak up some of the amazing sauce! PLEASE DO YOURSELF A FAVOR and visit this restaurant!

I was there Friday May 4th with a group of 20 people. I thought it would be amazing since it is Mastro's after all. It was the opposite. Good service, but food was so so. My twin lobsters were so over cooked. It was tough & crunchy. I ate half of one & gave up. Felt bad not to eat it, but it was awful. I eat lobster all of the time & it's supposed to melt in your mouth. That was not the case here. The rest of my group ordered filet mignon & they were all complaining as well. Over cooked & chewy is what I was told. The shrimp cocktail was fine. The oysters were ok. The asparagus wasn't good. The cremed corn was good. The alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi was excellent. The creme brulee was great. But, I would never go there again. Unless you are in the wooden dome seating area it fells like you're just eating at the food court in the mall. Not what I expected. Save your money please & go to STK in the Cosmo or Joe's at Caesars. The lobster is to die for.",

I have to say that I was disappointed with food and felt it wasn't worth the money.   We were a party of 4.  Started off with the tuna tartar tower and escargot.  I thought they lacked flavor.  I've had better at other places that are not that expensive.  My daughter had the gnocchi with Alaskan Crab as a entree.  She enjoyed it.  My son and BF had the Petite filets 6 oz and 8 oz.  They were tasty but again nothing special.  I had the twin lobster tails.  They came out cold and were flat and just ok.  The sides we had were basic Garlic mash and asparagus.  I informed the waiter about my lobster and he gave us the butter cake on the house.  I thought that was nice.  But then again heard that it was amazing and I didn't think so and happy we didn't have to pay for that.  Our server was nice enough but nothing special.  Guess my expectations were to high.",

    "text": "As a newer Yelper, this is only my second review and beyond deserved.  On our most recent trip to Las Vegas last weekend, my boyfriend and I ended up unexpectedly at Mastro's Ocean Club in Crystals inside City Center for the first time.  We go to Vegas quite a bit (about once every 2 months or so) and have passed by this place quite a few times.    The interestingly constructed architecture of the main dining area has been quite the source of amusement to us in the past... it resembles something like the shell of a wooden submarine that has exit chutes above and below it to spit you out into Crystals when you are done with your meal (btw, this is a joke.  You do not get ejected from your seat.  It is only my strange sense of humor that comes up with this stuff).  My imaginative uses for the architecture aside, the design/layout is nice; it makes you feel as if the restaurant is floating in the middle of Crystals with a very open and airy feel.  As we were walking through Crystals on our way back to our hotel room at Aria from a long day of shopping, we decided to make an impromptu stop at the ejection submarine and see if there was any chance they would take us as walk-ins on a busy Friday night.  With it being such an upscale spot, I was sure we would either be turned away without a reservation or asked to wait for a ridiculous amount of time.  Au contraire!  They offered us immediate seating in the bar/lounge area or a few minute wait for the main dining room.  Since we felt a bit underdressed for the location, we opted for the bar/lounge area and were glad we did.  We had the perfect seat right next to the piano player and fiery red-headed chanteuse, who was pleasantly entertaining.   We were promptly greeted by our amazing server, Sara.  The only reason I know her name is because I made sure to ask her for it when we were leaving as I knew I wanted to review this place.  Sara was so attentive, knowledgeable about menu, friendly, and always two steps ahead of us -  really as perfect as a server can get.  All of her recommendations were great as well.  I had the swordfish (I hadnt met my mercury quota for the month yet) and my boyfriend had the bone-in Ribeye.  We shared the most delicious side dish - the Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi.  My swordfish paired very well with gnocchi and it was the perfect combo of light and creamy.  However, my boyfriend's Ribeye wasnt anything stellar.  It wasnt as flavorful as a most quality Ribeyes should be.  It's on our do-not-order-again list.  This is an \"Ocean Club\" though so maybe that was his error for ordering one of the few non-seafood options.  Now,  for the absolute BEST part of the meal.... THE MOST HEAVENLY DESSERT EVER - Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake.  Even if the rest of the meal and service had been horrible, which it was far from, I would have given this place 5 stars just for this dessert!  I dreamt about this cake the rest of our stay in Vegas and cant wait to go back again on our next trip just to have it.  This creation alone makes Mastro's Ocean Club one of my top 5 all-time favorite restaurants.  I would happily get ejected from this sea-faring vessel any time! ;)  Sorry for the ridiculously long review, but I had so much to comment on and didnt know where to shorten it.",

Got a nice seat in the treehouse, with a view overlooking the Dior store downstairs.  Since we didn't want to be food comatose for our show later, we ordered just the petite filet, the regular filet, and a side of scalloped potatoes. I also ordered Coke, but beware that it's by the aluminum bottle and not with unlimited refills. The scalloped potatoes were rich and delicious, but the cheese was too much halfway through the side order. The meat was very tender and cooked to perfection. The medium was medium and the medium rare was just as it should be. Since it was our anniversary, they also brought by a complimentary slice of rich chocolate cake topped with raspberries and whipped cream. Overall a fantastic meal!",

The bowl of whip cream on the side was massive and well appreciated. Overall a good dessert but not great. The Caramel Bundino from DOCG and the Toffee Pudding at Gordon Ramsay steak easily demolish this offering however. Nice service and vibe though.",

The whipped cream was fresh and had thick- butter like texture but was amazing. The only thing wrong with my visit was that Aria was testing the fire alarms. There was not sound, but the fire alarms were flashing. You couldn't notice the lights outside of mastros because the surrounding area was bright, but inside of mastros the lights were very dim and it was dark. The flashing lights stood out and gave me a headache. Other than that, the cake was great.",

We love to cook and are quite good at it. We enjoy having foods that we can't cook. Getting that perfect crust on the steak is nearly impossible at home, but Mastros has it mastered and is worth the price. Ok the Mac and cheese is not as good as mine, sorry. The Brussels sprouts were very good but again, not as good as mine. The evening was wonderful. We had such mediocre dinners in Vegas up to this point that is was such a breath of fresh air. We have eaten at Mastros several times, even near our home, and never had a bad meal. This was our 26th anniversary and they even gave us a complimentary cake. Thank you.",

My wife & I ate here on our honeymoon & while he food was great, the service was amazing!!!  FOOD: My wife had the sea bass which was incredible. Buttery, delicate, flaky, delectable & flavorful. I had the incredible salmon & I was floored! Not to mention the huge complimentary warm butter cake was THE BEST RESTAURANT DESSERT I'VE EVER HAD!   SERVICE: We ordered the mac-n-cheese but our waiter brought out the wrong side dish. He didn't dispute it, he didn't make a face or impose a funny energy about it AT ALL! He simply said, oh we're so sorry! Keep this one & I'll bring out the correct side dish. Whattttt?!?! Where do they do that at???? Mastro's apparently! They even plate your sides onto your entree plate for you. Ultimately & even more importantly the servers & bus boys energies were warm & full of laughter & smiles. This ..... Is what service is about as my wife & I rave about this place to everyone! This inspired a HUGE TIP!   SYNOPSIS: You so called Michelin rated, 4 star uppity high end restaurants could learn a hell of a lot from Mastro's. They have single handed restored my faith that fine dining doesn't have to equate to stuffy, dry, bland, pretentious uninspired service & energy. 10 stars!",

We had sauteed shrimp as an app, and split the bone in filet, garlic mashed and 2 lobster tails.  All was great, but he highlights....     1.  The sauteed shrimp was one of the bet things I have ever eaten.  Perfectly cooked.  And the sauce was to die for.  It came with soft garlic bread to sop up the sauce.  I would have been happy with this for my entire meal.      2.  I got lobster tail two ways, but the vanilla fried was amazing.         Lastly and maybe most important was the dessert.  I am it a huge dessert fan, and we probably wouldn't have ordered dessert if it wasn't for them offering it for free for our anniversary.   We are fans for life.   I think they call it butter cake.   It was insane.   We had leftovers and ate it for breakfast.   Soooo good.",

    "text": "I've been to this location before and as always, they are on point with their customer service. It's always great to see them work together as a unit and are attentive to the guests. The glasses are never empty, offering of seconds on drinks and breads are consistent.   The waiters are very knowledgeable of their products. They know exactly how the meals are prepared and the taste of each item on their menu. They also offer great advices on how to maximize the flavor and food experience.   The side dishes are large enough for a party of 4 and the main course itself are large enough to satisfy your hunger.  I have to be honest, the last time I was here, I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass and I was underwhelmed by the preparation. With that said, I wanted to give another fish another try since they are after all, the \"Ocean Club\". I  ordered their feature of the day, the halibut which comes 3 ways: pan seared, cajun/creole rub, or breaded. With the suggestion from the waiter, I chose to go through the pan seared route. It was a good size fish, served with tartar sauce on the side. The fish was prepared nicely. It was flaky and juicy. However, again I was underwhelmed with the flavor. In my opinion, it was bland and flat. The tartar sauce didn't do anything as far as offering another dimension on flavor.   My friend ordered the lamb chop and he was not impressed either. It was prepared well, pink in the middle and tender but he said he was expecting more flavors.  The other friend ordered a tomahawk steak and it was big! He said it was good and flavorful. From the look of it, the meat was prepared well also. Perfectly pink in the middle throughout. He said it was good but had better.   My bestie ordered a wedge salad (of all the great options...she gets a salad!). She said it wasn't impressive. Just another wedge. Although she did mentioned that she liked their blue cheese crumbles.   The lobster bisque was very rich in flavor and had a lot of lobster chunks. I love a good lobster bisque...but the cream was a bit too rich. I wouldn't have been able to finish one by myself due to its richness, good thing it was split in half.    The lobster mashed potatoes were full of flavors and is extremely rich in butter and cream. It was served onto our plates by the host. The sugar snap peas were very tasty and had the perfect crunch and bite to it. The fries were just fries.   We were all too full to order a big dessert, I really wanted to order their butter cake but couldn't bring myself to do it so we ordered the creme brulee. It was served with a big bowl of homemade whipped cream and was a good compliment to the dessert. The brulee was sweet and the cream was not which balanced out the flavors nicely.  Overall, it is a great experience but I don't know if I can justify eating the fish here.",

The food is great and since you want everything the real problem becomes trying to not order too much. Service is top notch and the staff is very friendly and knowledgable. Shrimp cocktail is served chilled with dry ice and the atomic horseradish that comes with it is sweet and will singe your sinuses in the best possible way. The lobster mashed potatoes are a must get, rich and filled with large pieces of lobster meat. We also got the Wagyu tomahawk cut to share which was perfectly marbled.   So why not 5 stars?  These items may seem nit picky but you can be the judge. We ordered the Wagyu black and blue (seared rare) and while it did have the cool red center you really want a better crust on it. In addition I know we were sharing but they simply cut the steak down the middle with one person getting the bone piece. For something like this you would expect a presentation similar to a porterhouse. Lastly although it shouldn't matter that it located inside a mall it does mean that the people next to you could be in shorts, flip flops and a backwards baseball cap. I know it's Vegas but come on.",

It's served cracked, fresh, and insanely cold with a dramatic dry ice presentation.   Food and service deserves 5 stars, but here's what I want to take a point off of. Nobody warned us that portions were HUGE. We left half the food on the table, which was meant for one person.   Keep in mind I am a size 0, it's not hard to guess I won't have a huge appetite.  The smooth talking waiter talked us into getting the steak special, 20oz bone in for $90-100, not on menu. He said it was for ONE person. Also he suggested the lobster mashed potatoes as a side and sushi roll.   The steak was good, but too big for both of us to finish.  Then the server hands me the charred bone bit - actually, more like plop it in the mashed potato - and tells me to eat the meat off of it. Really? Are you expecting me to lick my fingers off after I chew off the meat with my teeth and hands like a classy lady?  We opted for half portion lobster potatoes instead of a full, which was still a whole bowl of potato mash swimming in a pool of butter. Whatever happened to mixing? The half portion of sweet potato fries had so much breading that I couldn't taste the sweet potato. I'm sure there's a lot of people who drool over this type of side dish, but I was certainly not one of them.  I'll give 4stars, but next time, please don't suggest ordering extra food when it's clear we can't even finish one plate. It's too good to waste!",

    "text": "Good service. Ok food. Expensive.  Went here on expense account with group of 12. Love the look of the wooden structure but we were seated outside of it so it was more like eating in the aria mall (which is also beautiful but not as distinctive). Very good bread. Mixed seafood appetizer was nice, with all the classic things you would expect like lobster and prawns prepared adequately. Jalapeno sashimi was also added and was great. Cocktails well prepared but not imaginative.   For dinner I had sea bass which was overcooked. When you order any of the fish, they ask if you want it pan seared or encrusted. Therefore there is nothing imaginative about any of the fish entrees. It's just a piece of fish on a plate. I think this approach can work for steak, but I'd really rather the chef put some effort into a creative method and flavor for each fish on the menu.  Sides were good but nothing noteworthy.  Overall par for the course for Vegas. Unjustifiably expensive food with service that is excellent but also a little pushy, so you end up with more food than you want to eat. Very beautiful venue. None of the food or cocktails stood out.",

Only down side was the dish was a bit oily.   For my entree I went w the Sea Bass. I can't express enough.. this was hands down the best Sea Bass I've ever had.   Last but definitely not least..

Just look for the giant wood art sculpture second floor of mall. it is breathtaking.   I love love love their lobster bisque  Ordered the filet mignon with garlic mash potatoes and roasted Brussels sprouts. For added flavor and $$$ I added truffle butter   It was awesome! Bread basket warm and delicious. My favorite is the pretzel bread.   My son had the Chilean sea bass. It just melts in your mouth. We had it simply prepared as pan seared.  My husband and other son had steak too and they were so focused on their meal so I know they loved their steaks.   Our server Micheal provided great service. lt all ended with their famous butter cake with homemade fresh whipped cream.   Our meal for a family of four was costly but worth every penny.  We visit Mastros every time we come to Vegas. See you next time",

And we ordered the Chardonnay to make a nice pairing with the Chilean seabass... we chose the pan seared crust, which we love! But this time they actually served it as a shoe sole, completely fibrous, Tasteless, horrible... I complained and the waitress kindly changed it to us, second try was grilled... and it was raw and frozen on the inside.... AWFUL yet uncomfortable to eat that fish raw! They gave us the butter cake (awesome cake!!!!) as a gift but they charged the Chilean seabass.... that was the worse $150 and luxury night wasted for a seabass diner.  The restaurant is amazing, but the food Is just okay, never would recommend it as the best Chilean seabass in any place.",

    "text": "Tried the famous Mastro's Ocean Seafood Club. Very unique dining facilities. The staff and management are first rate and the food menu is extensive.   The Bone Marrow was generous, prepared well and tasty but I think the salted butter used on the marrow and toast points made it a little salty to our taste. I just downed more water as it was so good.  We shared a tossed salad with tomatoes, onion and shrimp and was very clean and delicious.  The main course of Chilean Sea Bass was grilled to perfection. The filet was a couple inches thick and not over grilled. It was flaky and very delicious - every bite. You may want to share it - it was so good.  The Bone in Rib Eye lacked the common fat eye. The meat was perfectly cooked med rare but the cut I got was tougher than I expected. Looking back at the experience I should have said something but I soldiered on and finished the meat. It would just be bad ju-ju not to finish it.  The sides were the Lobster Mash and Sauteed Spinach. The Lobster Mash was just ok. I like mash potatoes with a thicker texture and not as soupy as they present it. I'll pass on it next time.  The dessert was the famous butter cake. Oh man, this was great with coffee. However, after the amount of food we already consumed the desert was just too much to finish. It felt like a shame not to finish the dessert. The perfect portion for us would have be to share the dessert between four instead of two. 5,000 calories later  Overall the experience was positively memorable  - 5,000 calories later. A little loud at times. The staff did everything they could to make it a great night. The food was prepared well but in the case of the Rib-Eye was sub par. Chalk it up to sub-par cut of meat. I'll go to Mastro's again.",

That's a bit harsh.  - The cheesecake was superb! So smooth and creamy. I highly recommend a slice! - The men's bathroom looks like a women's bathroom!

Capital Grill, Gallaghers, Sonoma Cellar, Hank's, and the list goes on, but nothing beats the food and service we've experienced tonight. The staff there were very attentive, someone always there to make sure everything was as we liked it. The food, I must say was exquisite! The ribeye steak was cooked to perfection, soft and flavorful. The salmon filet was flaky and juicy..the lobster mashed potato is a must! And to end it all, as full as we were..we just had to get the butter cake, which I can say was heaven! Very good experience, and we will definitely be back!

    "text": "Tried Mastro's for the first time on Saturday while staying in Vegas. Made a reservation on Yelp (super convenient and easy) for 5:15pm. Ended up coming 15 mins late because of traffic but was still seated right away after we arrived. If you do plan on coming here, leave about 30-40 mins (depends on traffic also) early since you do have to park/valet then walk into Crystals Mall located at Aria.  Appetizer - Tried the calamari and I would have to say I have had better. The calamari was reallllllly chewy. Some might prefer that but I don't believe calamari should be chewy. The only reason why it was enjoyable was the creamy sauce that came with it. I could eat the sauce by itself. It was THAT delicious. As a high-end restaurant, I was expecting better calamari, but Flemings and Ruth Chris both win on that dish.  Entree - Bone-in Filet and Bone-in Ribeye. The Filet was amazing! It was tender, juicy, and perfectly cooked. I usually get filet without the bone but decided to try something different and it did not do me wrong. The bone-in ribeye was good but not as good as the filet. It was soft in the center but the outside was too blacken for my taste. It was over-charred and slightly burnt in corners. Probably wouldn't get that again.  Sides- Lobster mashed potatoes.... WOW! Such a genius idea. $39 side... so you will expect something amazing and it was! So flavorful with lobster pieces in each bite. I will definitely get this again. Cream corn - nothing that stands out from other cream corn I have tried before. Though, I could tell the corn was cut from fresh corn, rather than using canned corn - which was a plus.   Complimentary bread - variety... probably 4-5 different types.  Service - from a 1-10, I'd give about 7.5. Server wasn't as personable or attentive.  1 appetizer, 2 sides and 2 steaks came out to be $188.",

Can't you see it's we who 'bout that life at...MASTRO'S OCEAN CLUB! - Miley Cyrus (we can't stop)  I made reservations here the day of as I wanted to watch a cirque show but didn't know if we wanted to watch the earlier or the later showing. No problems here, as Mastro's was very accommodating. When I came to check in, they were already aware that I had a two hour window before the show and made sure I'd be good to go. Off to a great start!  Seeing as I didn't eat any steak earlier in the trip, I had to get one here. It was super tasty and although a little closer to medium than medium rare, turned out to be just as fantastic. The chilean sea bass, which many yelpers have gotten, is excellent pan seared and a good sized portion as well. We also ordered sides of the lobster mashed potatoes and a half order of the Alaskan crab black truffle gnocchi. Both were served table side and both had huge chunks of lobster and king crab, respectively.  With about half an hour to go, our waitress knew about our showtime as well and brought us out the signature butter cake, which is a must order here. You're in Vegas; this thing is crazy buttery but oh man, you have to try it. If I'm staying at the Aria again next time, I would order this dessert to go to take back to the room.  Huge thumbs up for excellent service and the live music was fun and we got on our way on time. With a very cool atmosphere and location, I want to thank Mastro's for a memorable meal, I approve!",

We wanted steak, but didn't necessarily want to spend an arm and a leg. Well, we succeeded at the former, if not the latter, but we left very happy and very, very full.  We settled into the bar and I asked the bartender about the dry-iced martini. It was at that point I discovered the bar was much more about the fufu martinis rather than classic. I'm partial to the classics, so I was a bit disappointed. That said, that's E-Me - I should have checked out the menu in advance, or read a couple more Yelp reviews. (Take note if you're looking for a classic cocktail here, you won't find it.) I wound up going with the on the menu manhattan, which was very good, but not great.  Now it was time to settle into the real reason for going - meat. We had a bit of a conversation with the very friendly bartender about what was good and must-haves on the menu. We already knew we were having the bone marrow, which she did recommend. We talked steak and sides, when she insisted we have the brussel sprouts. Now, I'm not much of a brussel sprout fan, but given the recommendation that was given I figured we had to have them.  The bone marrow came out and it was two huge bones. I could have slid down them - I'd have been a very happy man if I had. The marrow was plentiful and delicious. You won't have to scrape just to get a little, you'll be scraping just to get the last little bit of all that wonderful marrow goodness.  Now for the steak. I did the bone-in ribeye, which came out perfectly rare - if not maybe a touch too rare, which is very weird for me to say. That said, it was amazingly flavorful and near melt-in-your-mouth. And the brussel sprouts - well, I'm not a True convert yet, but if you keep serving me more like these I might change my ways.  Then, on to dessert. A huge, and delicious, butter cake. We couldn't stop eating it despite the fact that we were absolutely stuffed.  In the end, and for the money, I do think there are better steak experiences to be had on the strip. That said, you absolutely can't go wrong with a stop to Mastro's.",

However, the lobster in the bisque was tough and chewy. The scalloped potatoes had an imitation cheese taste. My filet was terribly salty and undercooked. I ordered medium well and it was absolutely medium rare. Near purple center. I have never complained in a restaurant and would have if our waitress had ever come back. She stopped by when food was served and I was about to cut into my steak and never returned. After a long wait I finally had the bus boy clear it and asked him to find our waitress with the check. Total bill was $250 with a bottle of wine.",

I felt like we were dining in a modern interpretation of a Jack and the Beanstalk tree house above Superman's Fortress of Solitude. Enough imagery, onward to the food review.  The sea bass was amazing, the cod was very good; but the blackened halibuts were overdone (even the one we had specified medium rare). We also had crab cakes, a lobster bisque, and a salad - all done very well. Sides of creamed spinach and mushrooms were also on cue.  As such,  we made no mention of the less than perfect preparation of the halibut. Yet, a dessert arrived at the conclusion of our dinners, compliments of the house, as if the chef could read our minds. Maybe this is the real Superman's Fortress of Solitude!",

I decided to treat my girlfriend to a good dinner for her birthday and I remembered how she was saying that she wanted to try Mastro's Ocean Club. I took her there on February 19th as a surprise dinner. For the amount I paid, the service could have definitely been better. Started off great. Had a 9:00 reservation and was seated as soon as we arrived an hour early. Unfortunately the wait for drinks and food took a lot longer to come. The server was very pleasant, but whether she had too many tables, it just took way too long. The food was good. We absolutely loved the Lobster mashed potatoes, the steak was great, and the Swordfish ( usually one of my favorites ) was a decent entree. The dessert was pretty good too. It was the butter cake which they are known for. I may go back in the future, but there are many other places in town I think I would try first if I plan on spending over $250 on dinner again.",

I did extensive research before I picked a restaurant to take my mom for her 70th birthday dinner while in Vegas for the weekend. I ordered the bone-in filet; she ordered the grilled salmon. The salmon was absolutely delicious, perfectly cooked, generous size, literally melted like butter. Speaking of which, we ordered the heirloom tomato/cheese appetizer. OMG, yum, yum, yum! Again, the portion size huge for an appetizer. As for the bone-in filet, well, we both agreed the best steak we've ever tasted. Oh, and the bread basket? Huge, warm, ridiculously fresh variety of insane bread and butter. As for dessert, they brought her their signature warm butter cake with a side of whipped cream... okay, without questions, best dessert I have ever tasted! I literally brought the leftovers home on the plane the next day! As for SERVICE - top notch but not stuffy!!! Our waiter Tim was awesome!!! So funny, professional, accommodating, couldn't have asked for anything better. As for the PRICES - hey, it's Vegas, it's going to be expensive; however, there are thousands of restaurants that are overpriced and you feel ripped off when you are done - not Mastro's! Worth every penny if you ask me (and my mom!). Absolutely excellent dinner all the way around, would treat myself to this upscale dining experience any chance I could get!",

My bone-in filet (12ox) was tasty, but I personally miss the crisp edges and extra butter on the Ruth Chris' steak. The Mastro side dishes though, definitely beat Ruth Chris'. I loved the Truffled Gnocchi, Lobster Mash Potatoes, Sweet Potato Fries, and Oysters Rockefeller.   My highlight of the night was the butter cake! Yummy!",

The filet mignon was cooked to perfection and the sushi was excellent. The sushi dish actually came with quite a large amount of sushi. The bread basket was pretty nice also. We also got the asparagus and the mashed potatoes. We actually had a miscommunication with our very very knowledgable waitress and wanted lobster mashed potatoes instead. The manager came up to us and without hesitation brought us a lobster mashed potatoes literally within 3 minutes. The lobster mashed potatoes were also great. For dessert we had the butter cake and it was to die for. I'm not usually a cake person, but this was one of the best desserts I've ever had. Highly recommended - great service, great food. The price tag of the meal is quite high however; with all of our food the total was still about $100 even with a $100 gift card.",

The sides come out really hot in their own pans and we had the mac n cheese and green beans which were delicious. They have a great wine selection but the butter dessert cake really topped it off with the scoop of ice cream on top you just can't get enough of it.

Overall, it was a great experience, the service was good and the food and drinks were overall good, but not necessarily amazing (thus the 3 star rating).  Drinks: they have a great cocktail list. The first one I had was a nice smoky drink with a little bit of spice. I also had the spa day which was a strong but refreshing cucumber drink. The drinks were pricey ($15-$25) but everyone seemed to be happy.  Appetizers: We had shrimp, calamari and bone marrow. All was tasty and I would order again.  Main meal: For the main meal, I had the pacific swordfish Cajun style. This is where my rating got downgraded. My fish was a bit over cooked and this dry.

The service was outstanding, and I actually prefer this Las Vegas location to any of the ones in and around LA. It's a much more intimate and quiet restaurant.

Initially I thought it was going to have a \"food court\" feel to it. I was wrong, as soon as our waiter and pretzel bread arrived, we forgot all about the mall. Also worth noting, you never hear any pedestrian traffic. No weird mall conversations to ruin the atmosphere. The whole thing works brilliantly. Pretzel bread, home run. My wife always orders some smokey bubbling drink that is always from to watch and I get the same theatrics with the shrimp. Dry ice smoke shows make everything better.

    "text": "Enjoyed dinner here the other night. I had been to the location in Arizona a couple times and I remember loving the entire experience. So, needless to say I was yet again pleased with my experience at the Las Vegas location.   Honestly, I was a bit reluctant it being inside a mall, even though yes its the Crystals mall (which is not any average mall). We were seated at a table overlooking the edge, which kind of gave the appeal of being near a cliff. The host who greeted us was extremely friendly and personable. Our server greeted us within a few minutes and went over the menu and a couple items he suggested.     We started with the foie gras and escargot for appetizer. The escargot was average but the foie gras was delicious. Served with some sprigs of green and toasted bread. We also enjoyed half a dozen oysters on a half shell. We then moved on to have our entrees. Japaleno tuna sashimi definitely recommend this item. Truffled gnocchi was delicious as well as the creamed spinach.   Discovered a new wine as well, Leviathian, a red blend from St. Helena California. Extremely smooth and vibrant!  Still not disappointed with Maestro's",

Masto's Is my favorite restaurant on the planet and the Malibu, Vegas and Newport Beach locations top my list. I haven't been to a location yet that has disappointed me. My favorite choices on the menu, you may ask: Chilean Sea Bass-blackened, sauteed spinach, Mac and Cheese, Caesar's Salad, Wild mushrooms, Mastro's Margarita and Veuve Clicquot La Grande Dame Rose'. Just stop me now!!! I can't think about the Warm Butter Cake without getting all sorts of tingly.  So, its that time of the year again and I will be on my way in 3 weeks with a party of 19. I've already made my reservations for Saturday night and I'm hoping we get the Tree House again for my group. What can I say,  I'm a creature of habit and this is definitely a habit I don't plan to get rid of anytime soon. Hey Mastro's Las Vegas....See you in 3 weeks!",

You have ruined me!! #MeToo, my tastebuds were assaulted by what is known as a marblelous (see what i did there) Japanese A5 Wagyu steak :'( I had never had a steak this wonderful in my life. When people say a steak melts like butter in your mouth, they must be talking about Wagyu steak. I know for damn sure there is no other steak out there that can compare. When i saw the price, I was like \"this steak better have gold flakes on it or something..\" it was $150 for 8 oz but I thought what the heck its Vegas and I'd been winning at the tables yeah baby! So after ordering a lemon drop , a delicious concoction thats sweet and sour and gets you all warmed up, I went for it. Needless to say, everytime I eat steak from now on, they will be compared to this amazing steak, and they will always fall short in expectations :(. The boyfriend got his usual ribeye, still on the quest for the best ribeye. Nevertheless, he thoroughly enjoyed his meal. We ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese and lobster mashed potatoes. Both sides were delish, the service was attentive and not pretentious at all. Our server George was very knowledgeable about the menu and even suggested we try an appetizer thats not on the menu, thick cut maplewood bacon. Oh my god, ot was sooo damn good!  They added a special touch at the end of the meal, bringing out a big piece of chocolate cake with a heaping serving of fresh whipped cream, having mentioned my bf was celebrating his bday. Oh my lanta, just what we needed to cap off an amazing dinner.",

After leaving  review the restaurant manager contacted me didn't offer me anything beside basically telling me to let him know once we are in next time for better service .

Staff was incredibly friendly and we were greeted several times for water, bread, menus, etc.   The menu is extensive and delicious. It was difficult deciding on a drink with so many amazing choices. Although I wanted to try the in house infused vodka's - the red wine recommended by our server paired nicely with our filets.   We each ordered a filet and shared the lobster mashed potatoes. This was an incredibly amount of food. We weren't able to finish the lobster mash. We ordered medium filets with the black truffle butter. They were delicious albeit over cooked, which was a bit of a disappointment for a $52 steak. The lobster in the lobster mashed potatoes although plentiful was also over cooked and a bit chewy. Not a soft melt in your mouth lobster which was also a bummer.   For dessert (which we did save room for since no appetizers were ordered) we couldn't decide between the flourless pudding cake (GF) served molten lava style or the creme brulee (GF) - so when in Vegas - get both! And then we needed to be rolled out. They were amazing. The flourless cake was incredibly rich and neither of us were able to finish it. The creme brulee had vanilla bean and was light and perfect.   Our server George was great. He suggested a wonderful wine and was very knowledgeable on the menu and the ingredients the kitchen uses - which is helpful for me being gluten free.   Our water was never near empty and servers weren't hovering over us obnoxiously and came and went with ease, barely interrupting our dinner conversation.   The ambience of the restaurant is really cool as is the architecture. It does feel a little weird eating at such a classy establishment in a mall.   The steak with the truffle butter was probably one of the top 5 I've ever had. Had it not been overcooked - likely could have been top 3. The meal overall was the most expensive we've ever had and it was good - but not the best we've ever eaten. For the price we paid, I would have expected close to perfection on every front.    I'm struggling with either a 3 star or 4 star. This place has the potential to be 5 stars if the steaks are cooked properly and the lobster isn't overcooked.",

The bill came out to $300 with alcohol and (free!) dessert. I recommend getting several plates and sharing.   I highly recommend their truffle Alaskan crab gnocchi! I think it was a seasonal special but I hope they keep it on the menu. It was one of the best dishes I've had! They also served us really good rose. I normally don't care for rose (I prefer red wine) but their version was refreshing.   For dessert, they serve this delicious butter cake! It was enough for the whole group.

    "text": "Definitely not impressed. Read several reviews online before deciding that this would be where my husband and I would have dinner on our last night in Vegas. The only good things about my experience were the bread basket and the scallops appetizer. I had a petite filet and was not impressed. I ate maybe half of it. I would have thought that when our server saw that I had stopped eating that he would have asked if everything is ok. I did not want to complain so I didn't say anything and that is where I messed up. A manager stopped by and asked how everything was and that was after maybe 1-2 bites before I realized exactly how poor my steak was. I always order a filet when I go out for a nice meal and now I am wishing that I had just ordered the appetizer instead of wasting money on eating half of a meal. I am now back in my hotel room trying to figure out if I should try to go somewhere else to salvage my night and have something to eat. I will add that my husband had the ahi tuna sashimi and it was a very large portion and he enjoyed his meal. We ordered the garlic mashed potatoes and didn't even finish half of them, they were definitely nothing spectacular. There are way better dining options, so be careful what you order and if you don't like it then say something, unlike myself who is now out $125 for a mediocre dinner.",

Now you know the place is great when its part of a basket / bird nest sculpture...  On a serious note, the food was out of this world. I had the bone-in filet mignon, medium - one of the best filets I've EVER had...and I've had a lot of filets.  I can't remember all the sides I had, but they all were great as well. The sides are served \"family style\" so you can share with one or two people at a time. Service was at part overall. The hostesses were very accommodating with reservations (might be because it was a Monday). We did have to flag down our server once or twice...and usually I ding a restaurant for having to do that...but the food was so great this place gets a pass. Oh, and I think we were the youngest patrons the entire time. Could've been a fluke...again, was a Monday night.    Definitely would come again!",

Very attentive waiters, but not annoying. The food is good, it's just not great. I haven't been wow'd either time. I enjoyed my meal, yes, but wasn't super crazy. Maybe its' the price point and I dont feel I'm truly getting my moneys worth. I had the ribeye the first time and the sole the second time. I've had the calamari appetizer (PASS on this, not good), the mussels (pretty good both times), I also had the wedge salad which I always enjoy. Again, food is good, I'm not complaining, it's just not great. Drinks are good but like the food, on the priceyer end.",

My MIL always says that the first sign of a really fancy restaurant is that if you request a black napkin (to avoid the white lint on your clothes of course), they don't bat an eye and bring you one immediately. Well, at Mastro's, we didn't even have to ask - as we sat down our white napkins were removed and black ones were draped across our laps. Superb start.  Our waiter was both professional and friendly - we really enjoyed the service here.  The food was excellent, and too much of it of course! We wanted to try so many things that there was no way we could really eat it all.   And, they brought out a complimentary, decadent desert for my 30th birthday to end the night.  We drank and ate our way to belly bulging bliss...ready for club XS after this!",

Ive been there probably 20 times and ive never had a bad anything. Ive had everything on the menu because we often go to dinner with about 20 people so we order everything. Great wines, really fresh seafood, but the side dishes and desserts is what really sets them apart from others. My fav sides are brussels sprouts, scalloped potatoes, creamed corn, gorgonzola mac n cheese and mushrooms. For desserts nothing is better than the butter cake and pecan pie. If youre not a fan of raspberry sauce like myself you can order the butter cake without the raspberry and its heavenly! Its romantic enough for a date and trendy enough for dinner before going out with friends- like i said best restaurant in the entire world!",

    "text": "We went here last night for my girlfriend's birthday.  Mixed feelings about our experience.  To start off with, the service was impeccable.  Daniel and Tim made sure to constantly check in and my water glass was never empty.  We started out with the strawberry mules which tasted good and strong.  We skipped an appetizer and just munched on the bread basket which was also tasty.  For dinner, we ordered the lobster mash and steamed broccoli to share as our family style sides.  Our server came back to apologize that they were out of broccoli so we switched to spinach.  Both were good.  We loved the lobster mash. For our entrees, we ordered the 8oz petite filet, Chilean sea bass, sauteed scallops and another fish dish that I cannot recall at this time.  My scallops were great.  My friend said the other fish I can't recall was great as well.  Birthday girl had the petite filet and stated after her first bite that the quality of meat was definitely lacking.  After us all trying a bite, we agreed it did not taste like a very high quality meat.  The server confirmed it was corn fed beef sourced from various Midwestern farms.  Surprising for such a high quality restaurant to source corn fed beef.  The Chilean sea bass our other friend ordered was a bit over cooked making it dried out as well.  We mentioned our dislike of the steak to our server and he did apologize and offer to get us started on something else.  We were all sharing our meals and noted it was fine and we didn't need a replacement dish.  For dessert, we were treated to a happy birthday slice of chocolate cake (a bit dry) as well as the butter cake (which was phenomenal).  In the end, the steak was taken off our bill and both desserts were comped.  The service made our experience enjoyable despite some of our dishes being off.  5 stars for service, 3 stars for taste of food, 3 stars for price in comparison to quality of food.  Unfortunately, not sure the price is worth the quality of food you receive at this one.",

    "text": "I would rate this more of a 3.5.  For starters, the decor and architecture of this restaurant is absolutely breathtaking.  Based in the center of a classy mall, the treehouse area has a unique and interesting view of everything around you.  We went around 9, so no one was really shopping and the mall was pretty bare. I felt like I was in a different world!  For a Monday night the restaurant was hardly crowded and we were seated immediately at a table of our choice.  The complimentary bread was interesting, although there were several pieces that were extremely hard to bite into, I enjoyed the soft pretzel-like bread the most.  For drinks we tried the lemon drop and the cantaloupe martini.  Both very awesome, and the cool thing is that they come with the martini shaker, so you end up getting two drinks really.  I enjoyed both drinks, the cantaloupe one tasted like sweet cantaloupe but strong enough to get you buzzed.  As for the lemon drop, it was soooo cool - they put some kinda sizzling dry ice or something in it so it looked like a volcano when it came out.  I sat there in awe for like 2 minutes just staring at the smoke come out of my drink! Then sipped on it and got buzzed 10 min after hahahhaha.    As for the entree, we ordered the rib eye medium rare, macaroni and cheese, and creamed corn.  I'm sad to say but I wasn't too impressed with the rib eye.  I felt like it was cooked in fire too high - the bone was completely charred.  Even though the inside was medium rare, the outside had bad burnt areas all around it.  And since we shared a plate, they brought out another plate for me, but it was soooo hot that when we put food on it, the oil kept splattering on me!!!  I mean granted it was a nice gesture, but I did not like how bits of oil kept splattering on my nice dress!  So anyhow, despite the slight disappointment in the steak, the macaroni and creamed corn TOTALLY made up for it.  The macaroni came out in a sizzling pan where the cheese would not stop ooozing when you tried to take a spoon full of it off....just the way I like it!!! I couldn't stop eating the side items that I probably would have rather eaten those as my meal rather than the steak itself!  Anyhowl, I dont know if I'd come back for the steak, but I definitely appreciated the view, side items, and drinks.  Our bill came out to be $110 for 2 drinks, 2 side items, and 1 rib eye.  It was what we were expecting for a steakhouse at this caliber so not surprised.  I rounded up on the rating only because between the two of us, we shared the leftover mac and cheese and creamed corn the next day and still were satisfied :)",

When we arrived, they couldn't find my boyfriends reservation, although we have the email confirmation and the the notes he wrote that said it was my 30th birthday. They sat us anyway, without asking or engaging with us and we were seated by what I assume would be a manager. Anyhow, they sat us next two family with their kids running up and off the booths. When there were other tables not in between two families. We ordered the bone marrow and lobster bisque to start, both were great. We shared the tomahawk and truffle king crab gnocchi and mushrooms. All great, steak was pretty fatty but it was still good. Dessert we had the butter cake, I was expecting a candle or something since it was my birthday and I forgot they messed up on the reservation. So they had no clue it was my birthday. Overall completely disappointed in a very expensive dining experience.",

In the grand scheme of steakhouses, I'd rate the food a solid 4, perhaps a 5, but the attention to detail by the staff, fantastic cocktails, wonderful ambiance, and late hours helped Mastro's earn a 5th star in its belt.  I was a bit peeved that we had to wait almost 30 minutes for our table at the bar, but the generous cocktail pours helped soothe the senses.  Plus, we were late to our reservation by an hour and a half so I had to throw them a bone (haha!).  We arrived around 10:30pm and were surprised to find a happening bar scene and a 75% full dining room.  We left past 1am, but the staff was gracious and didn't try to rush us out even when we were the second to last table in the restaurant.  The food was delicious.  We may have over ordered on the appetizers, but we hadn't eaten in 12 hours so we figured we would indulge a bit.  Very fresh oysters with all the fixings with lemon halves that were wrapped in cheesecloth and speared onto a fork.  Great detail.  Smoked salmon plate was also good.  The fried calamari was ok - good, but certainly have had better.  My bone-in rib-eye was great.  Cooked a little past medium rare, but still tasted wonderful - a nice char on the outside, lightly salted crust.  The side dishes were also good, in particular the mac and cheese, but get it while it's still warm.  At the end of our meal, our coffee order came out a bit lukewarm, but it was close to closing time so I gave them a pass.  In honor of the groom, the staff also brought out a dessert with the words \"Don't do it!\" written in chocolate on the borders of the plate.  Again, great attention to detail.  I really think this is where Mastro's shines.  The details.  We were asked whether we wanted a black napkin versus a white one to minimize lint getting onto dark pants when we sat down.  I just received a phone call today asking whether we enjoyed our experience and to visit again.  I might have had a better steak elsewhere (not by much), but it's a real pleasure to dine somewhere that focuses on the little details that elevate a dining experience into a fine dining experience.  Bravo Mastro's - I will be back.",

I adore the gorgeous setting in Crystals, part of City Center in Vegas and  I love sitting at the opulent marble bar and enjoying a glass of wine.  The bartenders on this particular night were a little busy so we were not getting the service we usually would expect, but it was still good.  We ordered oysters for the appetizer.  As always, fresh and delicious!  The seafood here is consistently fresh and perfectly prepared. I have never had the steak, but people rave about that as well.  Mastros, you never let me down.  Next time I am home, I shall visit you.",

    "text": "We were celebrating my wife's birthday and decided that we would go out for a nice dinner.  After a couple of our first choices were not available, we did get a reservation at Mastro's.  I can see why they had availability on a Saturday night.  The night started out really well.  The live music in the lounge was very good, and our server in the bar recommended a fantastic Riesling.  Once we were seated, our server recommended a couple of salads.  I had a spinach/bacon salad.  Nothing special, but ended up being the star of the meal.   For the main course, I decided to try the vanilla batter twin lobster tails, because I read that it was a specialty of the chef.  I should have known something was up when the server also said I could get the tails baked or steamed, or a combination of those options.  I chose steamed and the vanilla batter.  The steamed tail was just fine, as expected.  The battered tail tasted like something from Long John Silvers.  It was so salty, and greasy, it ruined what should have been a great dinner.    We also ordered a twice baked potato to share.  This should be a very safe and tough to screw up dish.  They managed to do so.  My wife and I both commented that we get better twice baked potatoes from the grocery store, and we certainly prepare them better.  These must have been sitting out for a while, and were probably over cooked to begin with.  They were so dry, we could not finish it.  We had two waiters for the evening, and we never saw them.  I'm sure they saw our meal and did not want to check in with us.  No refills on our water, much less filling our wine glasses.  I did see the manager at another table, but she did not stop by to see us about our meal.  The star of the meal if there was one, was the portion size of the ahi tuna sashimi.  It was reasonably priced, but loaded with seeds, so bad that it was a chore to wade through them.",

He let us know that he also works at Mastro's Ocean Club so we also had to go visit him there...  This restaurant is gorgeous to look at and basically looks like a tree house with the Crystal's shopping area of City Center. It's gorgeous!  We started with amazing cappuccinos in the bar area since our favorite waiter, Dion, was not quite ready yet. I noticed that a cocktail that one girl in the bar was drinking was \"smoking\"... I think they put dry ice in it for effect!  When we were seated for lunch, we ordered the fried onion strings as an appetizer and the escargot. The bread including \"pretzel bread\" was a great appetizer too. The onion string serving size was HUGE and could have fed about 8 people. The escargot were in amazing sauce that I dipped my bread into afterward!   Then, I ordered the Cobb salad that came with a generous serving of huge prawns; it was delicious! He had the sea bass with the light bread crumb preparation and it was also amazing! We also shared the house mashed potatoes that included scallions, bacon, etc mixed in and were rich and delicious.   What a fabulous late lunch/early dinner on the way to the airport! It was tough to leave Vegas after an amazing meal like that though!",

    "text": "LOVE, love, love this restaurant!  What a treat and a perfect way to end an already awesome Vegas trip.  This restaurant is located within the new City Center mall and was ultra convenient to get to from the Aria Hotel.  We started the night by sitting at the live Piano Bar in the lounge and ordering Pomegranate Martini's on dry ice.  The Martini's bubbled from the dry ice.  It was very cool and they were oh so good.  As far as the food goes... the meat is so tender and cooked to perfection.  My husband and I split an 18 oz. Bone-In Steak and it was more than we could possibly eat.  The steak was gigantic.  It was also really nice that they cut it for us and brought it out on two plates.  With 4 people we ordered 3 separate side dishes and it was way too much food.  One side will feed 3 - 4 people easily, but they are all so good you have to try more than one.   By the time the chocolate birthday cake was served we were all so full that we had one bite and that was all but it was really good too.  The servers were really good and the atmosphere was perfect.  The tree house was really neat.  This is a definite must try.  Oh and I almost forgot... We shared the Lobster Bisque to start and it was the best ever.  We also really enjoyed the different breads in the basket.  I think the waitress said that the Pretzels come from Germany.  If you want an amazing dinner you have to try this place.",

    "text": "Delicious! Best steak I've had compared to: del frisco's, papa's, Perry's, Ruth Chris, Flemings, the strip house, Vic and Anthony's, Morton's .... All of them and more.   I don't remember what my cocktail was but it was a strawberry drink with a sugar rim. The shaker had an endless amount. I ended up with at least 3 full refills for $18.  The calamari was crispy and deceptively flavorful. They appeared to be plain, but the seasoning was just right. I did not care for the horseradish/mustard type sauce though, but I think that was just my dislike for those types of condiments.   I ordered the 12oz filet medium rare. It had a beautiful seared crust that was crispy and not burned. The inside was so perfectly tender juicy red and melted in my mouth. The texture of the two was perfect.   For sides we had the baked potatoe which was huge! But was the least appetizing item all night. The Gorgonzola Mac and cheese was delicious! I don't tend to like blue cheeses or very much cheese, but this cheese goodness was Devine. I enjoyed it so much I'm going to try to remake this this week for dinner! It was served in it's own skillet and was more than enough for myself and my two othe dinner companions.   Warm butter cake. What can I say but order this! I usually love tiramisu and cream brulee but mmmm this cake was so moist and had a crunch sugar top under the vanilla ice cream. The cream brulee was actually disappointing. I didn't care for the crust or Vanilla flavored cream... Or perhaps the butter cake just stole my heart.  The live small band sounded great with dinner. They werent too loud and the music was a good mix, classy good sounding modern and hit music, not clubby like stk. you wo t leave with a headach and sore throat.The atmosphere of the restaurant was light and elegant. I didn't mind that it was located in the crystals. Honestly I liked being able to walk around while we waited for our reservation we made through aria, our hotel. If you do have a bit of a wait go down stairs to the little water tornadoes. They are touch sensitive and you can control how they spin!",

It was cooked perfectly!!! but honestly it really needs sauce. not the type of steak you can eat by itself. maybe next time ill try ribeye. But with sauce its good.  SEAFOOD TOWER WAS INCREDIBLE!!!! Lobster Cocktail & Oysters were great. They use blue point oysters.  Lobster Mash was good.  For Dessert, the CHOCOLATE PUDDING CAKE WAS THE BEST!!!! Very similar to a Chocolate Lava Cake. Outstanding.  I love this place. Its so beautiful and it really represents living the good life!!!   Service is great. They have like 5 people waiting on your table, bread person, server, drink person. everything. Great great service.  Seating was quick. Probably because City Center is new. I am enjoying it though & i am not looking forward to when this place gets packed. LOVE IT!!! GOTTA TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE EXCLUSIVITY WHILE IT LASTS!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I talked some friends into joining me by talking up the butter cake.  To start off we were very late for our reservation due to a later than expected golf round and traffic.  I had to call to make sure our 6:30 reservation would be honored I was assured it would.  We arrived at 7:15 to a packed house but only had to wait 10 minutes at the bar, just time enough to enjoy a drink.  We were seated at a great table and were waited on non stop.  We all ordered individual appetizers I had the lump crab meat cocktail (my favorite).  The crab was dungeness my favorite and off the boat fresh, I however prefer a horseradish dipping source theirs came with cocktail sauce and mayo.  My entry was the baked halibut in a special seasoning particular to Mastro's it was very good!  We ordered sides as well the creamed spinach and creamed corn were really outstanding.  We enjoyed a great Pinot noir with dinner that our waiter helped us choose his wine knowledge was extensive.  For dessert we had the signature butter cake.  We enjoyed a lot of fine dinning on this trip but the four of us agreed Mastro's was the best!  If you have never been it is so worth the trip.  If you get a chance I recommend Mastro's Ocean Club as a must eat when visiting LV.",

Love the layout. This is a nice place if you wanted to do a business dinner! (We were just a party of two though) Appetizer- Dungeness crab cocktail. Okay. I am spoiled by Seattle's seafood so I have high expectations. Yes. The crab is good. Cold and refreshing. However for $25 dollars I rather have tried something else as I can get much more up north. However it was good.  Steak- bone in filet was their signature so that's the one we chose. I think they cooked it exactly the way we wanted. Medium rare. It was tender and it was good, but not melt in your mouth fantastic. It was overshadowed by (dun dun dun) the fish!!!  Seafood- Chilean sea bass. I got it the \"arreganato\" way. I probably butchered the word too. Holy crap this was amazing. It melted in your mouth and left you wondering where the heck it went so you just kept going back for more.  Sides: thanks to the yelper who gave the advice to get half the amt of gnocchi. Omg this is soooo good. The truffle oil just perfected it. Best gnocchi ever!! Lobster mashed potatoes was a huge portion (had to take it to go!) I am not really a mashed potato or lobster fan but my bf is and he really liked it so definitely try one of these sides.  Didnt have room for dessert but we really wanted to try the butter cake. Lame. Next time!  Overall a good experience but expect to cough up some serious $$$. Try the fish!!!",

The food was good to great. My wife's steak was a tad over cooked, but my steak \"Oscar style\" was awesome! The sides were generous and delicious (lobster bisque, gargonzola Mac & cheese, king crab gnocchi). And the butter cake for dessert...wow! The service was impeccable from our waitress Tanya to the support staff. Tanya was informative, attentive, and most of all friendly. If we make it back there, we will request her table for sure because we were very impressed. So, even though it is pricey, I highly recommend Mastro's. Cheers.",

    "text": "Great food, great service. awesome execution, and a wonderful wine list - This was the best meal I had in Las Vegas this year. I went back twice this week! Gnocchi with Alaskan crab ,truffle oil then topped with shaved black truffle and crisped panko bread crumbs is decadent and delish! It is served sizzling and definitely  enough to share between two people. I ordered a half portion the second visit and it still was enough between the two of  us! One of the best things i have ever eaten. I am picky about gnocchi and they do it light and pillowy here with a white sauce. On to the steaks, PRIME CUT EVERYTHING! all steaks are served on 400 degree plates with clarified butter and ur choice of salt/pepper or u can request cajun blackened. Phenomonal steaks and yes I am from Texas and still say this, My favorite winery is Michael David from Lodi  ..they make the good ol 7Deadlyzins, petite petit sirah and Mastros serves their Earthquake Cab for only two times markup (51 bucks)! this is a GREAT value for Vegas . SW steakhouse in the Wynn charges an obnoxious 5x markup! - This is important if you love wine with ur steaks. I had filet mignon, tomahawk ribeye,  truffle crab gnocchi, chocolate pudding cake, gorgonzola mac and cheese, lobster roll, and oysters rockefeller this week at mastros. The gnocchi , steaks and lobster roll were NOT TO BE MISSED here. I wasnt crazy about the mac and cheese but that may be because I was totally spoiled by the gnocchi(priced at 32 full portion, 16 for half portion) . If you are budgeting however the mac is only 13 and 6.50 for a half portion. try it you will love it ! Our waiter was excellent and attentive , this place is worth the money in the big pool of steakhouses in Vegas",

We checked in with the hostess, and the hostess who walked us to our seats was very friendly.   We sat next to the live band, a lady singer and a guy pianist/singer. They played really good music ranging from older American pop songs to older R&B songs with their own twist. I couldn't help but to quietly sing along during dinner.   We ordered the following:  1. lobster mashed potatoes - this was the best mashed potatoes I've had in my life. They really don't skimp on the lobster meat either you would find huge chunks, and it was like digging for treasure! The meat was also cooked just right, and it was really fresh. If you go to this restaurant, this side dish is a must get if you like lobster.   2. Sauteed Asparagus - pretty standard just got this dish to get some veggies.   3. Petite Filet Mignon - usually I like more flavorful cuts like ribeyes, and I don't really like filet mignons because they are lean. However this steak was so tender and cooked just right. I enjoyed it a lot. It was just the right portion, 8 oz, since I wasn't too hungry.  3. Sea Scallops - I had a small bite, the scallop was cooked just right, medium rare, and the meat was so sweet!!  Definitely recommend to come here on a special occasion, or if you won from gambling!",

At first I was not a fan of our server- took about 15 minutes to get menu's and an introduction. I think he heard me bitching about it because after that he went out of his way to attend to us. He was an odd fellow but he was trying very hard. I am a sucker for expensive glasses of wine and love it when a restaurant offers such- The server gave a very on point description of the wine I ordered. For entree I had the sea bass and my boyfriend had steak- something with a bone in it- I guess the rib eye? Im not sure about that as I dont eat beef...I was loving my sea bass until my darling mentioned that his steak was extremely salty...and in that moment I noticed that mine was also extremely salty...and I LOVE salt. The sea bass was cooked to perfection and was so flaky and delicious with just the perfect amount of crust on the outside. But- it was almost too salty to eat. My boyfriend said the same thing about the steak- that it was perfectly cooked and a great piece of meat but too salty to really enjoy.   Overall the meal cost me an arm and at least 2 legs...Service B+, Wine A+, Entree C, Bread A+, Price for what you get C+.",

    "text": "Surprised my wife with a trip to Vegas for our anniversary.  Stayed at Palazzo and have eaten at Craftsteak, Cut, Delmonico, and being from Chicago, we know our way around our Beef (Nine, Gene and Georgetti's, Gibsons, Chicago Chop House, Keefers, Kinzie...).  Considered return to Cut, booked and unbooked Carnevino and Prime before settling on Mastro's because of our evening plans (Mandarin Oriental for drinks) and because we've wanted to try the newbie here in Chicago.    Request, and wait for if necessary, the tree house dining.    Mike R (ASK FOR HIM, HE'S THAT GOOD) did an excellent job with the pacing of our meal.  He knew it was our anniversary and he made sure to congratulate us several times, chat us up without being intrusive, and sincerely took an interest in making our experience pleasurable.  Wife had the bone in Filet (12 oz) and I had the bone in Rib eye...plate, ordered the au gratin potatos to share (our server Mike R recommended one side to share due to the size) and the meal was worth every single of the five stars we are giving this place.      For our anniversary, they treated us to their signature butter cake.  We were stuffed but did our due dilligence....very tasty, very good, and if you actually save room for it, worth ordering.   Upon reflection, this was a perfect destination to celebrate an anniversary.  Live music was noticable, but not intrusive, the tree house, particularly when the sun went down, created a very romantic atmosphere.  Have read complaints about the setting (basically in the middle of the mall) but I don't share those complaints.  Yes, you are in a mall, albeit a mall the average person can walk through but not afford to shop in, but you hardly notice the people honestly.  Saw many people enjoying either bottles of wine (like us...oh, and yes the list has some mark up and bottles you would have to mortgage your home to afford, but also some very reasonably priced, well worth the mark up bottles to be enjoyed ... ) or their signature cocktails which were generous pours and will be on \"the list\" next time we visit.    But I have to come back to Mkie R, he was a throwback, a restaurant professional who knows the food, knows the wine list, knows the importance of making your feel as though he is there only to make your experience memorable.  I am not kidding, REQUEST him when you visit, you will write me and thank me profusely if you do.    We return to Vegas in September...will definitely drop by for drinks and desert at minimum.",

Mastro's Ocean Club was by far THE most expensive dinner I've EVER had (almost a grand including tips for two), but it was so @#$%^&!%$#! good!   What we ordered:  - Cosmo with dry ice - Mastro's Signature Seafood Tower with caviar* and lobster cocktail - Escargot with puff pastry - Tomahawk (bone-in ribeye) - Lobster mashed potatoes - Dessert? I'll pass. I just want my steak and lobster mash!!  * Seafood tower with caviar was the main item that drove up the bill. (i think it was 200-300 just for that). It's definitely feasible to have a more affordable dinner at Mastro's.  Writing this review makes me wanna go back to Vegas and order the tomahawk again. oh. my. gosh. sooooo amazing!!

First order of the night were drinks and appetizer. I ordered a lemon drop and surprised that the whole shaker remained on the table. I had probably 3-4 glass servings. There was dry ice in my martini glass so the fog effect was a nice treat!  For appetizer, we shared the crab cake which was just enough for us two. They brought out the bread (different types) and ALL freshly baked!  We also shared a Caesar salad per recommendation of our server cuz it was a good size. Not your average Caesar - you can tell is was all from scratch down to the anchovies.  For the main course, I ordered a 6oz filet and hubby ordered 12oz. Both perfect as expected. For the sides, we had the lobster mash potatoes (OMG!) and sauteed asparagus. All of it was scrumptious. Finally, they brought me my bday cake - butter cake topped with vanilla ice cream and a side of housemate whipped cream.  It was yummy and rich, But truly, this could be shared by six people, I barely scratched the surface.   Great atmosphere, great servers, awesome food!",

    "text": "One of the BEST meals our group agrees we've had. Even the simplest details, from the almost-double-portion martinis to the piping hot pretzel rolls are well-considered and designed to impress and welcome. Steak was incredible, portions were generous. We couldn't decide if the \"blackened\" finish or the truffle butter won more accolades, but I doubt you can go wrong.   I had the petit (6oz) filet mignon with a crab cake to create my own little \"surf & turf\". Again, portions were above and beyond so it was almost more than I could finish. Having lived in Boston and Maryland I'm extremely well-versed in seafood, especially lobster and crab cakes, so I tend not to order these items freely elsewhere. The crab cake was pan-fried but still great. (I tend to prefer broiled.) The steak was better than top steak houses in DC/NY. Honestly. Find a way to get steak and seafood into your meal!  For \"family style\" sides we ordered creamed spinach (unnecessary), crab gnocchi (food heaven), lobster mashed potatoes (must get), and sweet potato fries (I didn't even bother as I had too much more interesting food already). The server actually walks around to distribute the sides as you like, which again was a wonderful touch for our group of 9.   Other winners: shrimp sushi roll, all martinis, espresso drinks, tomato/burrata salad.   Our server was really fantastic. Friendly, efficient, doting, and plenty loud which again, is very important when you have lists of specials to communicate enthusiastically and a long table of 9 semi-rowdy friends.  We used to actually go off the Strip to find hidden top steakhouse gems but now Maestro's in Crystal Center will be the go-to.   If you have only ONE good/fancy/formal meal for your trip: go here.",

This was my first time visiting Mastro's and I had long heard of the famous warm butter cake, so I was excited to come for a pharm. rep dinner, get to learn and try a new place.   We made our selections from a pre-set menu.  My first course I went with the Caeser Salad, this was pretty standard except for the bits of anchovie throughout, which is my favorite kind of Caeser.   For my entree I chose the 8oz filet. I asked for it to be prepared medium. What came out was between rare and tartare. Since we were in a small private dining room for the lecture, I didn't feel comfortable sending my steak back, it would be disruptive, and I didn't want to interupt the lecturer. I ended up giving it to my friend to take home to her dogs.  The family style shared sides weren't impressive either. Mashed potatoes had no flavor, and the sugar snap peas as well. Only one I liked was the creamed spinach.   Dessert we had a choice between chocolate sin cake and cheesecake. I went with the chocolate cake, it came with a side of homemade whipped cream which I thought was better than the cake itself.   Pretty disappointing meal all together. I would come back for a second try, just not in a hurry to do so. I definitely enjoyed the lecture more than dinner.",

I wasn't that impressed with the venue, almost like a food court in Crystals, City Center. But the service and attention from the moment we arrived more than made us feel special. We had crab cakes, mussels, filet and lobster mashed potatoes. Super heated plates, everything cooked to perfection. We shared everything and had more than enough food for two. Oh and a couple of bottles of wine. The prices were not silly! I had mentioned on the reservation that it was a birthday and an absolutely phenomenal dessert was brought to the table with no prompt from me. The manager personally visited the table and left a card. The following morning I received a call asking how we enjoyed ourselves. Who does that?? Perfect attention to detail.",

Alaskan halibut: hubby says was very good. Creamed corn side: delish. Signature butter cake: so yummy! Sugar snap peas side: cooked perfect...super crunchy.

The hostesses explained the wait, and offered for us to have a drink in the lounge until our table was ready.  They kept checking in on us until we were ready to be seated.    We started with two cups of coffee and the Dungeness Crab Cocktail.  The crab came out on a cup of dry ice that was smoking and was a very good presentation, as well as being extremely tasty.  For dinner my wife had the 8oz. Petite Filet and I had the Chilean Sea Bass.  The waiter, Piotr, explained that the sides are served family style and that we should share a couple.  We chose the Lobster Mashed Potatoes and the Steamed Broccoli.  My wife, when asked how she wanted her meat cooked, asked for it to be medium, Piotr explained that medium would still have some pink in the center, and sensing the way that she likes hers cooked, recommended medium plus.  When it came out it was cooked perfectly, and was the most tender steak that she has ever had.  My Sea Bass was cooked so it had a nice, crispy shell of the outside, but was milky and soft on the inside.  The Lobster Mashed Potatoes has spoiled me, now I find it hard to not expect that kind of perfection from all other potatoes.  After dinner they brought out a complimentary Chocolate Sin Cake for us to share with a birthday message written in sauce on the plate.    Overall, this was an amazing meal at an amazing restaurant, and I would highly recommend this to anyone.  The prices are high, but you will get what you pay for.  My only regret is not being able to try the Warm Butter Cake everyone raves about, but I guess that means I have to go here again next time.",

We order a couple a la carte sides ( Yumm to the lobster mash) and I ordered the rack of lamb. I really like my lamb but unfortunately it was too much for me to finish. I highly recommend this place if you've never been.",

The only possible knock is the dining room, although sleek and modern with an amazing architectural tree house in the middle, is in the mall.  Even though this mall has the highest of high end shops, it still feels a bit like your eating in a mall. No biggee for me, just something to consider.  Food: Steak 5 stars - ribeye was an excellent cut and perfectly prepared Salad 5 stars - really simple but well done Wine list and our selection - 5 star - great bottle at reasonable price Desert - butter cake?  10 stars - best desert I have ever had - our group talked about it the rest of the trip   Service: Polite, professional and well trained.  What you get in a AAA five diamond restaurant.  Mastros should be proud.  This is even more rare than great food.  Ambiance:  The piano player, ultra modern dining area and spacious layout make this a great place for a business meeting, special occasion or date night.    Overall - awesome ++ Love it!",

    "text": "For starters I really wanted to give this place a great review because the food was good, but after receiving my bill I just can't do it.  Our total bill came up to $243.23. That's not my complaint. My complaint is that we left a cash tip and when we saw the charge on the card, it was for $291.88. I'm glad I kept my receipt.  This prompted a call from me to the restaurant today to find out why there was an additional $47.00 charged to my card without disclosing it to me. The manager told me that the company they use AUTOMATICALLY adds a 20% gratuity to the bill.   This was not disclosed to us by the waitress. It was not disclosed on our receipt. In fact, when I called, he said they receive that complaint at least 5 times a day, as if that's the normal order of business. FIX IT if people are complaining. You have no right to charge them an additional 20% without disclosing this BEFORE  they eat.  Tips are VOLUNTARY, not mandatory unless disclosed. I leave my tips in cash and I always cross out the tip line on the receipt.  The money isn't the issue,its the principle that they have no right to take my money without my permission. That is basically theft.   So now, I have to wait 2-3 business days for the additional $47 to be refunded to my card, which means I won't see my money until Tuesday or Wednesday, since we ate there Friday night. Other than this absurd experience with my bill, here is a review on the food.  1) The customer service is great except for not disclosing that I'll be charged an additional 20% even if you leave a cash tip.  2) The  crab cakes were good, but both my wife and I had a small piece of shell. Nothing worth complaining about.  3) My wife had the blackened ribeye. It was delicious.  4) I had rack of lamb. it was delicious.  5) Twice baked potato was good.  6) Gorgonzola mac & cheese was good.  7) Clam chowder was good.  8) Calamari was just OK.  9) The complimentary bread was mostly hard except for the pretzels. I don't mind a mix of breads, but when the majority are hard, its just not for us.   Overall, the food was good, but we will not be going back until the change they policy of charging people an additional 20% without their knowledge.  If you eat here PAY CASH.",

The table we were assigned was not one we liked and they had no problem letting us sit beside the balcony instead... I ordered the oysters on the half shell and even though the month of July has no r in it, they tasted extremely fresh. Their horseradish is amazing! For an entree I ordered the scallops. I have not ordered scallops in years because it's such a difficult food for restaurants to really have fresh but this was a worthy choice. My partner is vegetarian and her sides were homemade mashed potatoes, brussels sprouts and asparagus. Everything was so good that we forgot to leave space for dessert... Even the complimentary bread was irresistible. Thanks Mario!",

    "text": "Mastro's has good reviews and my honey really loves lobster bisque so we decided to give it a try. We had seen the strange bird house looking structure at Crystals many times before. We made a reservation for a table in the birdhouse although there are a lot of tables in the other sections of the restaurant. We were promptly seated and service started immediately. We ordered the vanilla battered shrimp as an appetizer. My wife ordered the lobster bisque which we shared. She ordered Parmesan crusted grouper. I ordered Blackened Chilean Sea Bass. For sides we ordered creamed spinach and sea salt and vinegar fries. My wife liked the shrimp, I was disappointed in it. It was very lightly tempura battered, very tender. I just thought it was bland. The lobster bisque was everything we had hoped for and more. It was thick and creamy with large pieces of lobster; very savory. The Parmesan crusted grouper was excellent. It was perfectly cooked and lightly spiced. The Sea Bass was perfect. It was very thick, light and flaky. The creamed spinach was excellent. The salt and vinegar fries were good. They are very thinly sliced (think potato sticks). But the best was still to come. We ordered their signature warm butter cake. OMG this may be the best cake either of us has ever eaten. It is served with a garnish of fresh fruit, a huge scoop of ice cream and fresh whipped cream. Regardless of what else you order here, you MUST try this warm butter cake. Service was excellent and she the price is fair.   Minuses- the noise level is very high. Very hard to hold a conversation. They have a large staff of servers, but service was slow. One of our sides was delivered as we finished our entre's.   We will definitely be back.",

Called for Reservations a week ahead and they called me the day off to confirm. I told them we were running 15 min late and they said it might take longer to seat us.  We ended up waiting 30 minutes before we gave up and left since we had a show to get to. I don't think pushing the reservations 15 back should have made that much of a dramatic wait difference - isn't the point of a reservation is to HOLD the table for me? Whats the diff between holding it 15min in the beginning than if i took an extra 15 min to eat/sit there?  Anyways, as we were waiting at the bar, another couple had  reservation as well and they were waiting longer than we were and also getting fed up.What's weird was there was a decent amount of empty tables so it wasn't like very table was filled to capacity.   Don't think I'll attempt to eat at this place, whats the point of reservations if you have to wait?",

When it was time for dessert I was too full for anything so I enjoyed a double espresso so I would be ready for a Vegas night!   I really should mention the ambience. The location is so cool it sort of feels like you are seated in the skeleton of a wine barrel or an old ship. The beautiful polished wood and dim lighting it had a very romantic feeling. Plus it is elevated in the heart of this shopping area so you can watch all the people passing by. I would definitely go again!",

Awesome decor  Tim was our server and he was friendly and very helpful with our selections.    We ordered both steaks and fish.  All the entrees come a la carte.  The steaks were steaming hot as they arrived.  Melted in your mouth!  My sea bass was delicious.    For the sides, make sure you get the mac & cheese, delicious!  We also had the sweet potato fries which were crispy and the broccoli.  The hot bread was also very delicious.  With no alcohol, our dinner for four was $275 plus tip.  Not an everyday place but definitely a once in Vegas trip.  The next morning Zach called us to follow up on our experience, I have never had this happen from a restaurant ever!  Nice touch",

I got a Spicy Mambo Salad and would probably skip it next time, only because it's just a caesar salad, sans croutons with a hint of wasabi. Kinda boring, but not worth losing a star over. Sweet potato fries are bomb, as are the mac & cheese and mashed sweet potatoes. DO NOT SKIP THE BUTTER CAKE. Thank me later.",

    "text": "I'm not sure where their high ratings come from. At the price they sell main courses ($35-$60) which includes no sides at all but just a piece of fish or meat is ridiculous as even then it's just a piece of meat - no interesting garnish or sauce even on the plate.   The quality of the fish was ok but we too don't live on the coast and the fish at our local Whole Foods is as good or better than here. Also their beef was just that - ok but I know our local store sells as high of quality.   Was pissed that this place charged $20 for an heirloom tomato salad and served it with the tomatoes cold as if straight from a fridge. Who the hell does that? The tomatoes should be stored at room temperature anyway and I certainly don't want a cold tomato salad. Weak and almost embarrassing for the restaurant.   The vegetable sides are about as generic as you can get and available almost anywhere. Brussels sprouts, green beans, garlic mashed potatoes -  not interesting nor were they very good.   Not sure if their high ratings come from people that live way outside a major city or maybe in live the middle of the country where chain restaurants are the only option but this place was downright shameful for the price and for the generic food preparation. Almost like they have no head chef running things but just an expediter slinging out the same old stuff every day and never thinking to change or improve things.   Bill was around $120/person. No problem if it was an amazing meal (or even above average) but again I could've cooked it better at home for 1/3 the price.   I guess this restaurant will keep cashing in on people don't who know any better or want the most simple uninspiring food on the planet.",

Our group of eight was seated at a round table underneath the massive open-air structure.   The lobster mashed potatoes were so buttery and delicious. This was a table favorite and it was devoured in minutes. I honestly think the garlic mashed potatoes would have probably tasted just as good and would have been much cheaper.   The 22oz bone-in ribeye was enormous. My friends and I were joking how maybe half the steak would just be bone, but it turns out we were sorely wrong .The bone was maybe 4-5 ounces and the rest of it was delicious, flavorful meat. I opted for medium rare, my friend opted for rare, and I think most of the table preferred the medium rare since it had more flavor although the rare meat was more tender. It really depends on your steak preferences.  The dessert was butter cake. The first couple bites I thought were way to sweet, but that's why it came with a side of heavy whip cream. Top the dessert with the whip cream and it really tones down the sweetness.  The things that stood out the most was the ambiance and quality of food.",

    "text": "I'm so disappointed to write this review.  We had such high expectations of Mastro's having been to their other locations.  Celebrating our wedding anniversary and completely giddy, we sat down, ordered cocktails and dove into the incredible bread basket.  Our waiter seemed annoyed with us from the start, but no big deal, we ignored it.  I ordered chicken (please spare me the \"you don't order chicken at a seafood place\" lecture...I ordered it because it was on the menu, so let's get through that, k? Lol).  Our waiter was non-existent all evening, so he wasn't around at all for me to tell him that the chicken was glaringly under-cooked.  The manager happened to see us looking around and took it back to the kitchen.  He brought the same re-cooked piece back, but one spot (it was a really thick piece) still didn't look ok.  We had the flash light out and kinda debated if it was cooked enough, but the chance of eating slightly under-cooked chicken and getting sick was not an appealing option to me.  (And should I be having this debate at such a fine restaurant?).  I decided not to chance it, but not say anything.  The manager saw me not eating (our waiter was still in abandonment mode), took it away and insisted on replacing it with a filet.  The filet came out and was delicious and we were happy, albeit the mood had changed.  We felt like we had done something wrong.  Honestly, our least favorite meal of the whole weekend.  No butter cake, no second drinks--happy anniversary to us.  :(  Thank you to the manager for not charging us for my chicken or filet and really trying to fix it, but I'm so sad we spent our anniversary there.",

The crab cocktail was delicious, perfectly cooked sweet crab with a decent cocktail sauce. The swordfish was a little dry on the sides but perfectly cooked towards in inside. The mushrooms were fantastic and full of garlic and butter. The gnocchi was to die for, so delicious and creamy and oh so full of crab- they do not skimp out here. The buttercake was delicious.   My largest complaint about Maestro's is the waitstaff. While they were very nice they were very pushy. They came 3 times in five minutes to ask if they could take our plates. It was probably around 6:30 and our plates were half full. There was no need for a rush.",

Our server wasn't that busy and we had already ordered drinks...so don't know why there was such a lag.  It was somewhat annoying, as we love their desserts.    The shrimp cocktail and jalapeno sashimi were outstanding.   Actually, the sashimi was better than similar dish at Nobu that we always order.   Crab cake was good.   We also had filet, crab legs and scallops.    All good.  Sides were average and actually didn't really enjoy the Brussel sprouts.     Still 4 stars but for an $$$$ dinner--should've been 5.",

The waiter took his three pieces of steak back where it was cooked dry. The brussel sprouts had no flavor and were just dry. I gave two stars because the waiter kept my water glass full. For a $200 meal I expect my food to be cooked properly. I've included a picture of my burnt steak.",

Service started out good but before we even got around to placing our order they were already falling flat. No drink menu or wine list for starters and to go along with that no wine recommendations. I guess if you don't want us to order wine, 1) don't give us a menu, 2) don't mention what pairs well. Service got obnoxiously slow after we ordered our food, so bad that one of our party went and lodged a complaint with the manager. The only saving grace on this visit was the food. Everyone seemed to enjoy their plates. I ordered the filet, which came out wonderful and cooked perfectly. For what they charge here, everything should have been dialed in, it's unfortunate that we didn't have the same experience so many others were able to enjoy.",

Excellent service with super friendly and knowledgeable staff, great ambiance and outstanding food.  Not too often you get all three in one place.  We went to Mastros on a Wednesday night recently and were seated in the bird cage area.  Very cool way to encase the restaurant in the mall.  Elizabeth and Daniel took care of us that night and what a great team.  So friendly, relaxed, professional and fun they made it such a great dining experience.  Before i even get to appetizers I have to mention the bread basket. I'm not a huge bread person but this was so good! And my martini was classic, simple and perfect. For appetizers we got the spicy salad and the heirloom tomatoes and buratta cheese.  I struggled feeling like I should choose some seafood but Daniel assured me the tomatoes were spectacular right now.  Boy oh boy was he right!  Fantastic flavors on both of these dishes.  For dinner my husband chose the filet rare which few places will actually cook RARE.  His was picture perfect.  I chose the seabass with the Oregenatta topping suggested by Elizabeth - DELICIOUS! Just outstanding.   Lucianna the Bar Manager realizing we were from Washington DC told us about the new restaurant opening there in just 2 days.  She was lovely to check that we were enjoying our time and sent over their signature butter cake for dessert.  we weren't going to get anything since we were stuffed but we dug into what we now call the dessert to beat all desserts.  My husband is a big chocolate person so saying this about vanilla cake with caramelized sugar, vanilla ice cream and raspberry sauce is something.  Like all the other diners say - this is not to be skipped!  when you pay a lot of money for dinner you want it to be good and rightly get annoyed when it's not.  We walked away saying this place is worth every single penny.  we haven't had such a lovely time in ages.  I cannot wait to return to Mastros in Las Vegas and will be sure to visit in DC.  Thank you Elizabeth, Daniel and Lucianna!",

It's part of the Mastro's chain, which I was familiar with before my visit from their store in Beverly Hills.  Despite the intimidating size of the City Center complex, if you park in the Crystals valet, getting in and out is really pretty easy.  The restaurant is everything you would expect from an eatery at this price point and more.  The service is immaculate and attentive. (I particularly like the flourish that comes with the simultaneous presentation of all of the table's entrees.)  Also, the manager came over and checked on us to make sure everything was perfect as well.  This restaurant has the steaks that you would expect from the Mastro's name but its primarily focus is seafood. (Thus the \"Ocean Club\" moniker.)  The quality and preparation are top notch.  In terms of the facility itself, part of the dining area sits in a stylized banyan tree. (Really.)  It certainly makes a statement and is definitely where the cool kids want to sit.  Finally, while it will shave months off of your life, you absolutely must have the butter cake desert - I lack the vocabulary to describe how utterly scrumptious this myocardial infarction inducing item is.",

As another reviewer pointed out, if you order a main dish, like the Sea Bass, it will come all by itself on a plate.  So order some side dishes.  The waiter will plate it up for you at your table.  We were so stuffed that we didn't have room for dessert.  Bummer, because I'm sure it would have been yummy.  Our bill was around $475 with tip.  So not too bad with all that we had, including cocktails and wine.",

It's Vegas, I really didn't need anything to make the evening warmer. The service was attentive, and the wine selection was nice.  I will definitely stop in at the new location Chicago to sample more of their appetizers and fish selections.",

A few comments:  1) the restaurant is in a high-end mall so it didn't feel very secluded or intimate; 2) we ordered creamed spinach and mashed potatoes as our sides.  These side portions could have easily fed 4-5 people each.  I wished that the waiter would have told us that how much food this is. Too much waste.  We were on vacation - so no doggy-bags possible.",

We also had the lobster mashed potatoes (amazing as well). unfortunately, we didn't have room for desert, but it a reason to go back!

Although it's basically a restaurant located in the middle of a shopping mall (albeit an upscale mall), it is a very pleasurable dining experience. The food here is incredible. The lemon drops are fantastic and entertaining as they are served smoking and bubbling. Excellent wines on the wine list. The filet here is magnificent. The truffle lobster gnocchi is out of this world. The side dishes are excellent and feed about four or five people. The warm butter cake is spectacular and is served with a huge bowl of some of the best whipped cream we have tasted. Unfortunately, one of the people in our party ordered the crab cakes and was disappointed with them as she thought they were over seasoned and almost tasted as though they were seasoned with poultry seasoning. The last time we ate at Mastro's Ocean the service was tad bit better, but compared to the poor service that we've been receiving lately, the service was outstanding. Did I mention the live pianist? Some of the people in our party thought they were listening to some recorded Billy Joel music and were surprised when they found out that it was actually a young man playing the piano.",

While there are a handful of high quality restaurants in Las Vegas, Mastros Ocean Club stood out for its consistent, high quality cuisine and  great service.  While the nose bleed prices are over the top and the greet staff unexceptional, the food was excellent, the portions ample, menu deep, ambiance nice and service excellent.  That, in and of itself, is sufficient for me to reserve at least one of my nights in Vegas.  The thing that would bring me there every night was my waitress, Heather.  Sweet, smart, personable, attentive, funny, efficient, knowlegable and unassuming.  She handled tables of conference guys, couples and singles with equal aplomb. I live in NYC, eat out alot, have my goto places with goto staff, and have to say that in a very short period of time Heather distinguished herself as top notch.  If you're lucky enough to get her as your waitress, with sufficent credit line, you'll eat there every night.",

By far my favorite part was the sea food tower, build it anyway you like, everything on there was so fresh I could hear waves crashing.  My steak was cooked exactly how I like it, and the wine flight pairing made for a nice compliment.  Only down side was because our party was somewhat large, and there was at least one other large party service was a little sparse and at one point we waited 15 min for someone to come around.  This is the only reason Maestros gets a 4 out of 5 in my book, however I will return as the food was just that good.",

I wish I could have spent 3 hours drinking my way through the meal and probably will allow myself that much time next visit.   I had the 12oz bone in filet, it was excellent. Our table ordered the gnocchi & crab as a side dish. Delicious even for $26.    It's a tiny bit awkward that it's in the middle of a massive shopping mall, for this kind of evening I wish I could just put on a nice dress and heels, take a cab and have a doorman open the restaurant door for me instead of trekking through a gi-normous mall up and down escalators to get there. However they make up for it with a cool bar and outstanding service.",

My husband and I are from Chicago and the Mastros here is my FAVORITE restaurant in the world (see review)- so I came to this one with really high expectations. First off our server, Tim, was phenomenal! So friendly, quick, and informative with every question we had. Next was the food, which was just as I expected- amazing. Husband had the bone in filet, and I did the halibut. Both delicious! I tried my girlfriends sea bass and that was awesome too. We all split a ton of apps and sides, and finished off with butter cakes for the table. Food coma heaven!  The only thing lacking was the atmosphere. (Why I knocked off 1 star) we were expecting a loud, energetic \"Vegas\" style restaurant (much like the one back home here in Chicago) But it was very quiet, bright, and just low energy. More suitable for a quiet dinner with your significant other, not a crazy group of 8 guys and 2 girls lol. But hey maybe that's the feel this Mastros is going for, which I can totally appreciate.",

The prices do support this, but once you divide it by 2 or 3 I feel it is worth it.  The wait staff is very friendly and knowledgeable.  They are excellent at giving you the actual methods of preparation, ingredients, etc. on any item vs. places where they basically repeat what is written on the menu (yes, I can read).  The lobster bisque is sublime.  The creamed spinach is wonderful.  The fish and seafood I have had each time was perfectly cooked and very tasty.  And above all else...be sure to save room for the warm butter cake!  I feel bad for the tourists that usually leave so much on the table.  Me....I'm walking out with my doggy bag!",

He made great recommendations, was attentive, was kind, was not annoying in the sense that he was trying to recommend only the most expensive things.  He was honest about what was good and not just based on price.  The steaks were cooked to perfection and they are huge!!!  You can seriously share a steak.  Like really.  The sides were amazing and also huge.  I mean seriously... Truffle Gnocchi!?!?  Holy hell!  And Lobster Mash?!!!  Yes please!  And you need to save room for the butter cake. You just have to.

I came here w/ a group of 20 other guys for my friends bachelor party and we were given a private room w/ a tv so we could watch some football. Boys night out w/ steak, wine, and football? Cant beat that. The Bachelor kept saying this was way too fancy and it was all too much when he walked in the room.

I highly recommend having Juan@Tanya as your servers. Those two are top notch. I am very picky on customer service. It seems like a forgotten art these days. They were friendly, never let our glasses empty and even helped with pairing  food. Juan even suggested we remove some items from our order just because it would be too much and we would of been stuffed. So many times these days wait staff don't care what you order or how much. And they expect their 20% regardless. Not these two! We will visit Mastro's again in the future.",

He was like no, you better try it.  So, I was on a hunt to try this warm butter cake.  To my surprise, my hotel is literally across the street from the place.   We get to the place at 11:30pm and the hostess tells us we're closed and we're bummed.  Bummed because we're scheduled to leave tomorrow and wouldn't have the chance to try it.  We begged to just sit at the bar and see if they would let us order dessert. She said sure...YAY :)  Got to the bar, looked at the menu and the bartender said you have to try our signature dessert dish and we said ok but we're here for one thing and he said the warm butter cake and we were like YES!!!!!  When it came out it was sooo beautiful.  To cute to cut!!! The cuteness didn't last long.  We took our first bite and OMG...decadence!!!! It was mouth watering. It was fabulous. It was soooooooo sweet and so good.  i could feel my sugar levels going up but I didn't care :)  Gotta try it!!!",

Granted it's Mastro's ocean club, their salmon was excellent, but their steak. Egh, dry not too flavorful. Service was excellent, we sat upstairs in our own room which was lovely.  However the service did not make up for the food. Will not be returning.",

We started with the crab cake, then tried the ahi tuna tostada. We had the Seabass and the John Dory fish with a large sized side of the Lobster Gnocchi. The service was impeccable. This has to be one of the best seafood places anywhere.",

The atmosphere is very inviting and romantic, and the servings are VERY generous. I was full after eating just bread, my appetizer, and side salad! Lol Our most recent visit was on Valentine's day evening. We were seated in the private dining area upstairs and were very pleased with the service. Our waiter was extremely friendly and informative if we had any questions regarding anything on the menu. The hostesses were VERY welcoming and easy to talk to over the phone when making reservations. Our most recent visit was fantastic! They even gave us a butter cake \"on the house\" as a thank you for visiting them on Valentine's Day (Score!). We had a wonderful experience and overall, the food, atmosphere, service, experience, etc, was all top notch! Highly recommended.   The ONLY thing I had a problem with, was halfway through our meal, we noticed there were so many servers and waiters, some of them stood around and walked around aimlessly (WITHIN the private dining area, instead of out in the hall) because, well... I don't know.. maybe they just couldn't find anything to do because there were so many of them? It made me a bit uncomfortable as I felt I was being watched or stared at. I'm sure this was due to the fact that Valentine's day was a busy one for them, so I'm sure it's not normal. But, still..",

Off the bat I felt out of place in my \"los pollos hermanos\" graphic t-shirt, basketball shorts, and flip flops, but they made me feel welcome anyways. The service was nuts, by the time I entered and had my plate of food, I was probably introduced to like 8 different people, all of them friendly and accomodating. They work super fast and efficient too, the lady swooped around behind me and refilled my water without me even noticing. When they brought out our food, they had a person for each plate, and put it all on our table within a few seconds. I was like daaaayuuummm sooonnnn. food was great too.",

I had the pleasure of having a gentleman named Matt as my server and he made for an extremely delightful experience. He knew the menu and the specials by heart and gave me great recommendations based on my interests. He was friendly, professional and even cracked a few jokes which made my solo dinner outing so much less uncomfortable - felt like he was an old friend.   I had the truffle gnocchi which I highly suggest if you're a truffle fan. Thanks also to Matt for recommending the butter cake which was to die for. It's waiters like him that keep me coming back to places like this. A+",

My sister had to ask her to direct us which way. As we walked in to the dining room another waiter saw us looking confused and sat us at a table. She needs to be fired!!!

My friend had the chocolate cake which was good too. I ordered a martini and it was so tasty, they even bring you the remaining in the martini shaker! Brandon was our server and was very professional, the bussers and water servers were so on point as well! Would highly recommend this place!",

The Kumato oysters were fresh, but sandy. I wish we would have tried the crab or lobster instead.  The steak was good, but had parts that were more heavily seasoned than others. It was still tasty, but I felt Ruth's Chris does a better steak. The mac and cheese was mediocre and could be skipped next time. The asparagus was fresh, but the tips weren't cooked. I did like that they serve the sides for you. The berry dream cocktail was to die for! It was strong, but didn't have the strong alcohol taste and the server shakes it up table side and leaves you the remains in the shaker. Definite plus! For dessert, they brought out the chocolate cake for our anniversary celebration. It was overly sweet and a bit dry. I really wanted to try the butter cake so we ordered one of those too. Very decadent and delicious. I enjoyed the slightly crisp edges and soft, warm center with the ice cream.  Overall, this was a good experience. We would come back the next time and try more of the seafood.",

The service was absolutely amazing; the waiters practically catered to our every whim and made sure that our time at Mastro's was warm and inviting. The appetizers were delicious. The escargot was average but the steamed mussels were very good.   I ordered the petite fillet cooked to medium. My parents ordered their special of the night: the Australian wagyu. Let me just say the steaks were absolutely amazing. Definitely 5 star status; both of the steaks were flavorful and tender. The juices from the meat blended incredibly well with the spices. These were probably some of the best steaks I've eaten and I've eaten at a ton of places.   The lobster mashed potatoes and the Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi was just so delicious and filled with epic flavors, I give my kindest remarks to the chef. The meal was too amazing.   We were too stuffed for any dessert but the next time, I'll be sure to try something off of their dessert menu. This restaurant was way above expectation: service was extraordinary, food was delicious, amazing presentation and ambiance. Absolutely perfect! I love Mastro's and will be sure to visit again.",

For dinner I got the petite filet special. This was different than the regular petite filet, because it came with the most delicious king crab leg meat as well in a yummy butter sauce. I honestly could only eat half of the steak, this was just too much food all around.   For sides, we got the mushrooms, creamed corn, creamed spinach, sweet potato fries, and scalloped potatoes. holy bananas these were all so good.  Then we finished with the butter cake!!

    "text": "I was so excited to try Mastros for the first time after hearing such amazing things about the place. Boyfriend made reservations here for our 8 year anniversary on a Saturday evening, requesting to sit inside the \"treehouse\" that everyone on yelp recommended. They even called him the day before to confirm if we were still coming.   We arrived about 5 minutes early and the host immediately had an \"oh crap\" look once we gave her the name for our reservation. She said if we wanted to sit in the treehouse it would be a 45 minute wait.. I was so upset because we made reservations almost a month in advance and the fact that they called us the day before to make sure we were still coming... Whatever  We didn't want to wait the extra 45 minutes cause we were starving, so they sat us at a different table.   We ordered cocktails, which were really good and strong! We got crab legs as appetizer and they were really fresh, I liked the cocktail sauce that came with it. We decided to share the bone in filet because we didn't want leftovers because the hotel we stayed at had no fridge, they were kind enough to split this for us. We also ordered scalloped potatoes as a side. The steak was okay, a little too salty for my liking. The potatoes were still hard, I wish we got Mac and cheese instead. Even though we split the steak we still couldn't finish it, we ended up taking it togo along with the potatoes.   For dessert we got the infamous butter cake and it was delicious! They put and candle and wrote happy anniversary, which was really sweet of them. When the check came I noticed that they charged us for the anniversary cake, I was reading other reviews that people got their dessert comped?! Anyways, overall I'm not sure if I'll return, at least not this location. I'm still bitter that they couldn't accommodate our seating arrangement for our anniversary.",

I was there during restaurant week and got the three course - chowder, strip, and butter cake. I'll save room for more steak next time, but the cake was delicious (not really a sweet tooth kind of person). I was amazed at the quality and freshness of the seafood - we got the tower with dungeoness and snow crab, prawns, and oysters ($200).   Everything was totally worth it. The service was impeccable.",

    "text": "Mastro's literally is THE best restaurant in Las Vegas.   The restaurant overlooks the main floor of Crystal's and is absolutely gorgeous. Very spacious with plenty of seating area.  I've been here about 4 times and am never disappointed. In fact, I think I'm even more impressed each and every time I go and fall in love with the restaurant all over again.   Service: Impeccable, from the hosts to the servers. I've had a light skinned African American male with dreadlocks and glasses twice (embarrassing I should really remember his name) and he was quite delightful. I've had other servers as well who without a doubt, like the gentleman we had twice, ensured we were taken care of throughout our entire meal.   Food: To die for. The best bone-in ribeye I've ever had. I've tried quite a few steakhouses in Las Vegas (ribeyes because I am obsessed) and none compare to Mastro's. Their appetizers and sides are wonderful too! I've tried their scallops which are soft like butter, tuna tartare, lobster mashed potatoes (a must try), Gorgonzola mac and cheese, king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and the brussels sprouts (gotta have some veggies).  Wine: They have one of my favorite Cabernets here that pairs perfectly with the ribeye, Chateau St. Jean. Highly recommend with your meal if you're enjoying steak, not seafood.  Dessert: Do the butter cake. Comes with a heaping pile of homemade whipped cream. Sweet, warm, and delicious!  I love this restaurant. Writing this review makes me want to go there this week. A perfect 5!",

    "text": "Unfortunately this was not one of those awesome Mastro's visits that everyone raves about. We've been to both Mastro's in OC and the one in LA and this was by far the least pleasant visit. We've also been to a lot of the high-end restaurants in LV and typically skipped Mastro's because we could get it easily when we lived in SoCal. But now that we live out of state, we were craving BUTTER CAKE!  When Mastro's called to confirm our reservations, we mentioned that we would be coming in straight form the airport, and they said it wouldn't be a problem to store our luggage during dinner. Upon arrival, they didn't have any room in the clutter closet behind the hostess stand. We brought our luggage to the dinner table which was slightly awkward but there was room.  We had two different main waiters and the service was a bit off. The appetizers were cleared from the table and placed on a stand next to us...not sure why they weren't just removed. Then the entrees came - we were warned about the hot plates but they were barely warm. I ordered the steak medium rare and parts of it was rare so I didn't eat it. It took a long time to flag down someone to get our dessert order. I had previously mentioned in my OpenTable reservation that we were celebrating a friend's birthday. Mastro's was very kind in bringing out a slice of chocolate cake for her with a message written on the plate. When the butter cake finally came out, it was also not very warm. We didn't finish the cake but it was still pretty delicious.  Maybe this experience was an anomaly or off night, but we won't be back soon. Even if the butter cake is divine.",

    "text": "This review is not about foods but about how the servers pushes its patrons to have more foods than what they wish to order. We had to repeat and tell our waiter \" No\" several times in respond to him asking us \"I can just double every order.\" If we wanted double of all our appetizers orders, we would have requested double. We came here yesterday to celebrate our best friend 40th birthday. We are a tight group of close friends and know each other likes and dislikes. We all love fine dining and enjoy Maestro Ocean club on a regular base. So it's disheartening for me to write this review as the foods and services have always been excellent in the many years we've dined at Maestro's establishment. (not this particular one) This was our first time at this Maestro in Vegas and because of this incident, we may not return here. We were charged 2x for majority of our appetizers dishes. We specifically told our waiter NOT to double as we like varieties and didn't want to fill up so much as our meals are always so filling. The night was fun and We didn't feel the need to check our bill. It wasn't the first time and Maestro have always given us superb service. But the next day, my friends and I all look over our bill, $2,286 for our large group of 16 but to have the waiter took it upon himself to ADD it to our order was a bit of a disappointment. I hope this is not a regular practice of this Maestro with large parties. So if you dine here, please check your bill and make sure to emphasize with the servers what you would like to \"Double\" or not.",

    "text": "After reading the Yelp reviews on Mastro's, I was excited about having a high-end steakhouse experience. I was a little suspicious that their Yelp rating was so high since they were nowhere to be found on multiple lists of the best steakhouses in Vegas, but we needed a place that could accommodate a vegetarian, the Yelp rating was 4.5 with over 1000 reviews, and the decor looked inviting and unique. However, I wish I had listened to my gut and gone something else.  The service was incredibly slow and poor in quality. I had to ask twice about the location of our waitress after being seated for 5-10 minutes with no service. Each time, I was told she was \"on her way,\" and one server offered this same excuse even after our waitress finally showed up. It seemed like a standard line they were using rather than actually communicating with each other and coordinating adequate service. Furthermore, they serve the side dishes for you, which took an unfortunate turn when one of the servers missed the plate with our macaroni and cheese and decided that pulling the hot, cheesy mess over my wife's lap was a better idea than putting the spoon over the plate or returning the mac and cheese to its dish.   Also, they heat their steak plates to over 400 degrees, a fact that they are quite proud of. In my opinion, a truly high-end restaurant shouldn't have a gimmick, let alone one that has no appreciable purpose. I really enjoyed not being able to adjust my plate on the table, in addition to having a personal space heater for the evening. /s  I like my steak medium rare, and I was warned that they tend to undercook their meats, but I ordered a medium rare NY strip anyways. Imagine my surprise when I received a steak that was medium at best (medium pink center with a few reddish juices) and too chargrilled on the outside to really appreciate the cut of meat (44 Farms). I've had better steak for the same price at restaurants back home. How is this considered a good experience in one of America's steakhouse meccas? My wife ordered the clam chowder and couldn't even bring herself to finish it.   The sides weren't terrible, but I don't agree with the other reviewers about the lobster mashed potatoes. For $35 I expect to see more than 2 tiny pieces of lobster meat. They tasted fine but were nothing mind-blowing. For that price, there should have been at least a few whole chunks of lobster meat to enjoy. The twin lobster tails run twice the price on Mastro's menu; am I supposed to believe that the cost of potatoes is so much that they couldn't afford to include even half of a single lobster tail? The brussels sprouts were overcooked as well, with their charred exterior overwhelming any proper flavor.  The treehouse design of the restaurant is an interesting concept and looks cool in pictures, but in reality, you are floating over a shopping mall, and seeing/hearing shoppers meander about really detracts from any sense of class you hoped to have during your meal.    Overall, I expected much more given the critical acclaim Yelp has for this place. The next time I'm in Vegas, I'll stick to the big name steakhouses or at least those that worthy of a mention on Eater.",

So my mom, grandma,  and I were late for our 6:15 reso. I made the reso via open table letting them know it was my moms birthday and we'd like a table in the tree house. Even though we were late(double your travel time if its raining) they honored our table request!   We started with 2 lemon drop martinis and a glass of white zin. The lemon martinis are no joke. The lemon flavor is PERFECT. Our sever Brandon(I think) explained that they infuse vodka with lemons to make the martinis. For apps we had bone marrow which was served with an arugula salad dressed with capers and escargot served with puff pastry. Both were PHENOMENAL. My 89 yo grandma killed the bone marrow!   For our meal we shared sea scallops,  ribeye,  alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi, creamed corn, and mashed sweet potatoes. Everything was FANTASTIC!! The scallops were served in a garlic butter sauce with tomato and parm. I could have licked the bowl they were served in! Because we shared the ribeye it was sliced for us and we were supplied with tongs to serve ourselves(after the initial serving the manager and server helped serve). I loved how they served us our food!  You need to get the gnocchi. It is AMAZING. The creamed corn was fantastic too. Our service was fantastic. We ordered sparkling wine and our flutes were never empty. Timing of the courses was great. We finished our meal with chocolate layer cake and butter cake. Both were oh the house because it was my moms bday and because we're locals. I didn't care for the chocolate cake but the butter cake was good!! For all the items above including tax and 20+% tip we spent $140 per person. Pretty hefty but well worth it!",

I had to ask for my plates to be cleared.   Regarding the food:  average food, way way overpriced.  Everyone on yelp raves about the butter cake?  Not good at all. One friend had the Chilean Southeast Asia bass and said it was actually great. Another friend had the Clear Lobster Roll and said it was in the bottom 2% of sushi he's ever had; all rice.  I had the ribeye, wife had the NY strip. I should have had the strip.   Cocktails were a hit!  Tiki Time, Lemon Drop, Caliente Breeze!    And then they brought the wrong birthday cake??  REALLY??!!  Watch your check closely. Review it carefully. Audit the bill folks. Or, just skip Mastro's and walk to In-n-Out Burgers. Better food, better price.",

    "text": "Absolutely beautiful and delicious! Made reservations for this place back in January based on the Yelp reviews. So glad I did! Well worth every dollar! Husband and I are celebrating our 10 year anniversary... (one notch down, 1,000 to go) Our waiter, George was on point! He started us off with a lemon drop martini.... yeah it was the bomb! Appetizers (crab cakes) were amazing, they give you so much food, no way you leave without a take home bag or two. Husband ordered the swordfish, I chose the 22oz. ribeye (medium). When the plate arrived it was so hot the steak was still sizzling! Cooked to perfection. Lawd have mercy! Lobster mashed potatoes were so smooth and well seasoned. Creamed spinach was definitely fresh, not frozen. Also had to try Alaskan king crab black truffle gnocchi. Very good I must say!  The lemonade was perfect and they made sure to place it with a refill each time. To end our experience, we received a large complimentary slice of double chocolate cake to share! I honestly don't have anything negative to say about this restaurant.  We will definitely visit again while in Vegas.  *I suggest casual attire* *Take pictures, you don't want to forget this restaurant*",

Don't dress like you are going to a buffet. I suggest a jacket for men and something nice for women.   Once you get there you are greeted by lovely people. You will be seated in a beautiful space with comfortable chairs. They have a full bar and an extensive, and very expensive wine list. Not being rich, I skip the wine so I can have more starters. All of them are amazing.  They have the best oyster rockerfeller you will find in the state. As for mains, the sea bass, any steak, the lobster and any fresh fish are cooked to perfection. Get the lobster mashed potatoes. Get two--I do, but I forgot about a diet years ago. They are just heaven.   You are never rushed but there is great service and they are there when you need them.

My husband and I are well-versed in dining at steak houses/restaurants and out of all the places we decided on Mastro's. We like the flavor and sides and appreciate good service.  Overall we had a pleasant experience with our server and accommodations.  Food was good although I wasn't a big fan of the tomahawk since I'm more of a filet mignon type.  I would've given this place 5 stars but I felt like they were too bougie to acknowledge our celebrating our anniversary. In the middle of crystals shopping plaza with rich people all around who needed our business. My bro in law used to manage the one in Newport coast so it wasn't a big deal for us.  If I had to choose another place to eat I would've if I knew they didn't  celebrate or even ask why we were dining there.",

But remember to make a reservation as they can get pretty crazy packed.   We wanted to try to crab cocktail but they ran out, so we got the shrimp cocktail instead. Those giant shrimps were delicious! For entree, I tried the Chilean Sea Bass and got it pan seared, which I really enjoyed. We also got the bone-in ribeye (huge portion) that was cooked perfectly and was super juicy. We shared the buttery lobster mashed potato and was one of the best mashed potatoes I've ever tried. They sure don't skimp out on the lobsters they put in there. The portion of the mashed potato (a side dish) was pretty big so I would recommend sharing that with 3-4 people. But as far as my favorite thing from Mastro's, I still crave it everyday - would be their warm butter cake (also extremely huge so you can share with 3-4 people). I don't think I ever had anything like that, it tasted exactly like the name, warm and buttery, topped with fresh strawberries and their house made whipped cream. I know it sounds plain and simple but trust me, try it!!   I cannot wait to be back, mainly because of their warm butter cake but also excited to try their other seafood options!",

    "text": "This review is purely for a stop at the bar, not a dining experience.    On a hot summer night, my husband and I were walking down the strip, taking advantage of a few kid-free hours.  We were looking for something new and different to try when we walked past the Aria.  Just inside the attached shopping center and right off the strip, is Mastro's.  My husband has been wanting to try it out, but to be honest we weren't sure this was the right day because we were wearing shorts and sandals.   We walked up and asked about the dress code.  Surprisingly they said, \"No problem!\" and pointed us inside and to the left when we asked about the bar.    We walked in straight to the bar, which is a little small, with some tables just behind it.  Dining tables extend into a interesting architectural feature that has you eating suspended over the shopping center.  With a full bar, there are several cocktails and other beverages available, including a few signature ones.  They are pricey (like  $20 a drink), so make sure that you know that going in.  I like sweet stuff so I had a dream berry martini with a sugar rim. It was yummy.  The bartenders were very helpful and fun to chat with.  The cool thing about this place is it is definitely a celebrity hangout.  We were there during NBA summer league, so my husband saw Laker legend Magic Johnson and got a hug and a handshake out of him.  The staff likes to keep it low-key so we did not push for pics.  Stop by this cool spot and have a drink!  I'm hoping to come back for a meal some day.  You never know who you might run into!",

The front door of the restaurant seems to set an atmosphere of warmth with dark wood. However, after walking further in, it opens up and feels like a mall. I understand, the restaurant is in a mall but I had thought the inside of the restaurant would be more intimate.  The server was completely professional and also perfunctory, the food was good but lacked salt and appeared rapidly plated. The whole experience seems like a great example of when corporate rules kill passion.",

It was a go to place for special occasions and business dinners when it had to be awesome. Never disappoints had the chance to plan a night out with my Sweetie and this popped up on Open Table and we knew it would be great. As usual, I'm never wrong. Mastro's hit a homer.   First it's in a great location in Crystal Shops in Aria complex. Easy to get to from pretty much anywhere in that general south Strip area. For us we were at Cosmo and easy 5 minute walk. I was a little taken aback at first since the location seems centered in an open area in the mall. Not an issue regarding noise or intimacy. Once seated in a great comfortable booth in center area it was service central. We had a couple cocktails. Wife two thumbs on pomegranate martini. I'm a simpleton so had a Redbreast on rocks. Extensive bar menu.   They double team service so you are always being attended too by Pro's. Anticipate needs and appear. Service like this is under rated and more rare. We decided to split a surf and turf with sea bass and boneless ribeye to enjoy both sides of the protein world. They have the best sea bass bar none and know how to sear and get the skin crispy with tender flesh. Again over the top. The ribeye might been a touch more rare than we wanted, but the small portion left on our plate says not a big issue. Sides we did max and cheese and creamed spinach. Both are large portions that we barely made a dent in and we left fully stuffed.   Good choice in a super competitive LV strip market but superstars from many by doing things just a bit better.",

The staff is super professional and make you feel like a good. They take care of your water, pick up any croutons, make sure your drink is filled up.  Mastro's Ocean club specializes in seafood and their many offers every type of fished cooked different ways: Pan seared, grilled, and blackened.  I personally have had the Chilean Sea Bass, and its magnificent. They give you a thick filet and they cook it just perfectly.  Mastro's is also really good at steaks and I've had the filet mignon and is amazing!!! The sides are shareable and I highly recommend the lobster mashed potatoes. It's the most delicious mashed potatoes ever, with generous pieces of lobster.  The clam chowder is nice and can be split between two people.  For appetizer I tied the shrimp cocktail and OMG! The biggest shrimps ever! The cocktail sauce was a little bit to hot but delicious!  As most of you have read the main thing about Mastro's is the Buttercream cake. A delicious dessert with pieces of fruit, ice cream and home made whipped cream. This cake can no be described with words you can just try it and enjoy it \"mmmmmmm\" feel the most amazing flavors in your mouth.  I know my review is getting longer but I can't leave without mentioning my favorite cocktail. This guys have a cocktail name Hennessy Sidecard. It's made with Hennessy and juices, it's a strong and delicious drink. They bring you the shaker to the table. Cheers!",

Went there to celebrate my husbands birthday and asked if we can have a special table when I made the reservations, we get there and they seat us in the wayyyy back of the restaurant where no one is there. I asked the server to change tables is when the manager walked over and spoke to us like we were idiots!! So I said whatever. For the next 11 minutes the servers were breaking up tables moving chairs and making so much noise and at this point we haven't seen our server or even gotten a glass of water! We decided to walk out then the same manager walked back over and asked what was the problem we said well we asked to switch tables which you didn't wanna do then for 11 minutes we had to heat tables and chairs banging around and No server to be found. He them says I'll switch your table if you want???? Really Dan really?? No it's to late 30minutez were wasted. Thank you mastros for ruining our evening!! Thank you Dan the manager for being so rude!

The seafood here is top notch and as fresh as it gets.   Everything from the amazing crab cakes, to the scallops, and outrageously fresh king crab legs were any seafood diners dream come True. The Chilean Sea Bass was perfectly cooked and super flaky and buttery.  Warm Butter Cake, their signature dessert, is worth saving room for.   On top of that, service was one of the best I've ever had in any restaurant. Super attentive but not overly fawning - they were always there at the right time.",

Mastro's Ocean Club ranks at the very top of all of my dinning experiences. The restaurant is located in the Crystals Shops in the Aria hotel. The place is quite stylish and spacious.  What is there not to love about Mastro's? The carefully crafted cocktails and perfectly cooked food with amazing sides dishes is a given for a calibre of this restaurant. The menu is varied and offers a wide selection of seafood and steaks. Other vegetarian options and (chicken, duck, eggs) are also available. The accompanying dishes, wine pairings and cocktails were really what dining at Mastro's to a higher level of excellence.   The only time I eat bread and butter is while dining at restaurants. I certainly wasn't disappointed by the carefully arranged basket of bread and the purest of butter goodness at Mastro's. Since I'm a vegetarian, chef prepared perfect pasta for me off the menu. Sides of note; macaroni and cheese was one of the best ones I have had. The sauteed mushrooms were absolutely out of this world. For desert a butter cake that was large enough to serve 2. One of the better butter cakes I have had.  A tequilla based cocktail marked the start of our eating festivities and a good South Australian Shiraz ensured the gleeful fine dining momentum continued throughout. Mastro's is absolutely on the pricy side. However, it's literally worth every single penny. I cannot recommend this restaurant enough.",

This is not a cheap place to eat, however, I had the bone in ribeye which frankly, I would put against any non Waygu steak in town, it was fantastic, the same could be said off my lobster bisque, I can honestly say, this was perfection.  The not so good....  Caesars salad, it was okay, a little heavy on the anchovies, which considering I love anchovies means it could be way to much for some.  Scalloped potatoes, they were under cooked, not terrible, but just a little more time in the kitchen would have done wonders for them.  The bad....  Sea bass, yes it's sea bass, so it does tend to pick up the flavors of the other foods on the plate, however, there was no saving this dish, I will say, it was perfectly cooked  The really bad....  The service, at this price point, service needs to be top notch, now I counted 15 or so waiters and assistant waiters, however, service was slow, I do not mean it was rushed, I mean it just wasn't there.  As I said above, the sea bass dish was not good, however, there was no way to send it back as the food was dropped off and everyone disappeared, we suddenly became invisible.  Drinks were left empty, which considering the cost of $5 for a very small bottle of soda, you would think that management would make sure they were being pushed by the staff, the same could be said for the $16 gin and tonic, though I will say, the pour on the gin and tonics was at least a double, so the price could be forgiven, what can not is having to walk to the hostess station to get someone to find someone to get us drinks and deal with the bad fish dish.  This should of been an excellent dinner, however the service levels were not there, if you do decide to try it, the ribeye is hard to beat.",

Our julienned vinegar and salt french fries could have been a side dish for a table of 6 without a problem.     We enjoyed the Rack of Lamb and Blackened Swordfish, both expertly cooked although the blackened fish had more than its' serving of salt in the seasoning. The twice baked potato was rockin' and we also loved the Brussel sprouts. Don't miss the butter cake which comes warm and a la mode.     The service was so amazing it felt like we were their only table.",

Waiter was really nice and explained the menu to us while suggesting very popular items.   For appetizers we started off with the \"Oyster Rockefeller\" and \"Sauteed Shrimp\". The oysters were not bad but let's just say we won't order them again. The shrimp on the other hand were very delicious. Had great seasoning and the creamy butter sauce was pretty amazing.  Main course le boyfriend and I each both had the \"22oz Bone in Ribeye\". And for sides we did the \"Lobster mashed, Cream corn & Sauted mushrooms\". Both steaks were cooked and seasoned to perfection. \"Seriously best steak I've ever had in my life\"... those were the boyfriends words since this was my first time in over a year eating red meat. But I have to agree with him. The lobster mashed potatoes were so creamy and buttery. Cream of corn was very tasty, almost reminded me of the mexican corn with out all the cheese. The sauteed mushrooms were also very delicious. Very happy with the entrees and sides we got. I fell in love with all of them.  Las but not least, DESSERT!.  Waiter brought us out a chocolate piece of cake with fresh whipped cream. I did not care so much for this cake as it was a little on the dry side for me but eh it was complimentary for our Anniversary. I knew I had to order the famous Butter Cake so I did. The butter cake came out super warm with a big scoop of ice cream on top. Okay so this cake was good but I feel like I've had better dessert. I hate salt on any dessert so this was a huge downfall for me. Cake tasted like a very sweet, buttery corn bread. I don't know how to make out of this cake but if I go back I probably won't order it again. Yes I know very sad as everyone literally worships this cake. Over all I had a great experience and I cannot wait to go back again. I think this is my new favorite steak house.",

As the Kool-Aid Man famously yells, \"Ohhhh, Yeeaaahhhh!\"  Every course we ordered was mouth-watering delicious, from the Sea Scallops to the Filet and Lobster Tail to the complimentary Chocolate Cake I received for my birthday.

But this time, his boyfriend had a client to impress, so we off we went on a steak dinner.  Yay me!  Anyhow, since it is rare back home in Honolulu to find a filet with bone in, that's what they got.  Myself, because my eating habits have changed (boo!!) I opted for the petite filet.  I know, sad, right?  I got 8 ounces of meat!  Not the 12 ounces they ordered.  I got my meat rare, cold center, hot plate.  Mmmm I just love a good piece of meat especially when you can control how you're gonna receive it.  I got it just the way I want it, which is actually hard to come by.  I'll take it the way I want it.  He says out loud, \"you think you know a person,\" when I ordered my meat rare.  Oh, honey, you've known me for how many years now, and you still don't know how I like my meat?  As rare as can be is how I like it and I got a True piece of meat perfection.  You know that I ate all of it!  I love me some meat!  The rest of the dishes were typical.  Salads, soups, sides were just regular, nothing extraordinarily spectacular to really write about.  The portions for those items are generous, I must say.  We did order a bottle of wine to go with dinner.  I think it was a shiraz.  I didn't pick it out, but it did go well with dinner.  And since it was their birthday, there was dessert.  Not 1, but 2, since two of them were celebrating.  One was a butter cake and the other a chocolate cake.  How nice, right?  We couldn't finish the desserts, but I must say they were very rich and of course yummy.  Would I return again?  Most definitely!  It's good that this place was a nice walk from our hotel.  I sure am glad that they are open late, since my eating habits were out of wack.  I love me some meat!!",

Their customer service here at Mastros was superb!! They know how to make customers feel like they're having a great eating experience.   We started with a bottle of Moscato! Nivole Moscato D'asti is my favorite!!   I had a little trouble deciding what I wanted to eat for dinner, but when I saw the Chilean Sea Bass in the menu, I was hooked! They rubbed panko bread crumbs and fried it lightly to perfection!! My husband had the rib eye cooked medium well! And guess what? It was medium well!! They had a long list of sides. We went with the Lobster Mashed Potatoes, which had big chunks of fresh lobster. The lobster and potatoes just melted in your mouth because of all the butter! And then we had the Gorgonzola Mac & Cheese!   I was so sad that our hotel room did not have a refrigerator. I would have definitely took our left overs with me. As we left the restaurant, I was devastated! The food was absolutely delicious and I wished I had room in my belly to finish all of it!",

The atmosphere at Mastro's is open, airy, cool and is perched inside a funky tree house in the center of Crystals at City Center.   But my most recent visit was to the bar for a drink with a friend having just seen Akhob by James Turrell at Louis Vuitton.  It was about 4:45PM on a Thursday.  The bar is not incredibly large, but is it welcoming, tasteful, upscale and classy.  Their drinks are priced in the $15-$21 range, but are really the essence of a great mixologists and high style.  The cocktail list is extensive.  The bartender was quick to have me taste a few things and explore my senses a bit.    A solid bar experience!",

Many of you might know lots of dishes with \"lobsters\" ain't really serving many lobsters in it (not even with \"Red Lobsters\"), but man, this dish came with A LOT OF lobsters in it, which made me speechless with the tenderness and the flavor of the sauce! It totally worth $38. And also you can see the size of the Bone-in ribeye (22 oz.) which I took more than half home cause I was hungry but not that hungry haha! We had a great experience with the service as well, the GM on training came to say hi with friendly introduce. We will be back fo sho! :)",

The staff, from the hostess to our waiter, were very friendly, and our waiter was very knowledgable on the menu, chef preparation recommendations and specials. He also didn't hover too much, which is appreciated.   Our table started with calamari and an order of one of the day's selected oysters. The calamari was incredibly tender, the oysters were excellent too - the delicate cucumber flavor was exactly as described by our waiter.  For our main course, I had the arctic char oreganata (prepared with seasoned breadcrumbs) and my companions had the special wagyu and Chilean sea bass. For sides, we split the gorgonzola mac & cheese, sauteed asparagus and creamed corn.   I'm deducted one star for the slightly underseasoned sides and for the ridiculously large portion sizes. My arctic char, while delicious, was enough for three meals (no, seriously, it was a pound of fish), and the sides were also much larger than you would expect at a restaurant in this price range, which can significantly limit the variety of sides you can try if you're dining in a party of 5 or less.",

This intimidating slab of wagyu beef was perfectly medium rare, well marbled, and seasoned with care despite it's size. Definitely one of the best, if not the best, steaks I have had. You can be a monster and eat it all, or even split it with someone and order a few sides.   So what if Mastro's is in a mall or if the \"treehouse\" is a little tacky for your tastes...you'll forget after your first bite. Best mall food ever.",

    "text": "First off, the service was outstanding. As per my request, they were able to save us a table inside the tree house near the edge, so we had a nice view of the architecture around us. Our server Sam managed to be attentive and informative without being too intrusive and asking us how the food was every few seconds, which I thoroughly appreciated.   Usually I don't talk about the bread basket, but this one was pretty good. The bread was warm and soft, but waay too much for two people. On to the main courses: the rack of lamb was tender, juicy, and perfectly medium rare..kind of wish there was a bit more seasoning though. The bone-in ribeye was just as tender and more to my liking, although the outside seemed pretty charred...  After we were done with the mains, we barely had any room left for dessert, but I kept reading reviews for the warm butter cake, so we ordered it to share. The cake came with a HUGE helping of whipped cream on the side and a big scoop of ice cream on top...naturally, we couldn't finish it and asked to have it wrapped up. The cake was moist and the layer of crunch outside from the caramelized sugar was great, but overall, it was too sweet. =(    We definitely made a good choice coming here. The food and service was all really good. Will definitely try to come back again next time we're in town.",

They give you the right amount of service at the table, checking on you timely but without interrupting or being overbearing. When the set up the table, I saw the manager readjusting to make sure the setting was perfect, they even put a light on the wine and water glasses to make sure they are perfectly clean! Everyone is super polite, you are rushed but not left unattended either. They have nailed it! We really appreciated it.  Food is delicious.

    "text": "We went to Mastro's on a Sunday early evening for dinner.  There were maybe three to four other tables occupied but other than that there was plenty of good seating available.    Speaking of seating, I found the set up a little off-putting...we were seated at a two person table that butted directly against the back of a circular seating arrangement, which just so happened to contain 3-4 lovely active young children on this day.  Somehow your ability to enjoy a nice meal is a bit inhibited with a 5 year old staring at you from 1.5 feet away.  Perhaps it was our fault for not requesting one of the 50 odd other empty tables.  As other yelpsters have stated it is also a bit weird to be enjoying a $$$$ meal with Miley Cyrus cranking in the background due to the open seating overlooking/hearing the mall like Crystal Shops.  Enough nit picking though, on to the food!  Our server was very attentive and started us out promptly with ice water and tea.  Micro demerit for including a lemon in my iced tea after asking to hold the lemon, but no big deal.  Huge stars go out to the staff for keeping the beverages brimming full, a frequent problem for such an iced tea addict as myself.  The bread service came with enough to feed a small army.  Mini-loaves of sourdough, pretzel, bruschetta, and French.    We ordered the Calamari ($15).  There was plenty for the two of us, lightly breaded and including a lemon side and a dipping sauce very similar to the Outback sauce you get with bloomin onions.    Taking the \"go big or go home\" philosophy I decided to order the twin lobster tails ($69) AND 22 oz Ribeye ($55) for my entree.  My girlfriend ordered the sea bass ($50) and we split a side of lobster mashed potatoes ($38).    The steak was wonderfully charred, cooked medium.   The server was nice enough to \"de-shell\" the lobster tails.  The lobster was perfectly cooked and delicious with melted butter.  The sea bass was also excellent.  I let my date enjoy the majority of the potatoes as they were a bit soupy due to the sauce but the small portion I had did taste good.    We got the butter cake to go, not sure on the price, it came complete with detailed instructions on how to best prepare it from our server.  Final bill with tip $325.",

Our sides were the lobster mashed potatoes and the Mac n cheese. We also had calamari which was the best any of us had ever eaten. Only thing I regret was not saving room for the desserts I saw at other tables. Two sides were more than enough for our group of 6! I did not find the total bill to be too much! Any nice place I expect to be around $100 per person. Overall a perfect dinner",

I've better had better escargot's at a Vietnamese restaurant in Little Saigon. My Chilean Seabass was a tragedy, usually my favorite fish. It had to be the oil or butter that they pan seared it in that tastes like gasoline and left me nauseated. It was the fist time I left Chilean Seabass half eaten. The shoe string fries was mostly fried in the same horrific lard. Even ketchup couldn't salvage the flavor.  The mushrooms were good but my nausea keep me for enjoying them.   The 18 oz bone in filet was had no character what so ever. Such a disappointment compared to other Mastro's that we dined at.  I've had good steaks at good restaurants. This place isn't it.",

We also ordered sides of steamed broccoli and garlic mashed potatoes. Since it was her birthday, she got a free warm butter cake with a personal touch!   The food was good - although there was a wee bit of over-charred areas on the steak and the butter cake was also a bit too sweet (maybe my taste buds are too sensitive now).

Boyfriend ordered lobster tail and in his exact words \"best lobster tail I've ever had.\" I'm glad he felt that way since the rest was just ok.

It's funny . . . we live in Scottsdale, home of the original Mastro's and Mastro's Ocean Club, and yet, this is where we decided to dine in Las Vegas. Having never been to Mastro's Ocean Club in Scottsdale, but knowing friends far and wide have been so delighted there, we thought on our vacation, we should give the sister restaurant a try! We are so glad we did!  The space itself is very unique in design. We were seated in the \"Tree House\". It is quite a spectacle from inside as well as outside as the wood towers from the lower level of the Crystals shopping center to the very top with a rounded platform area, that kind of resembles an open wooden spaceship, within which is the dining room seating. It is very light and airy. There is plenty of room between tables and despite some of other reviewers complaints that the music is loud, we had no problem with it, even on a Friday night.  Our waiter (I think his name is Robert) was one of the best servers we have ever had, in just about any restaurant in which we have dined. He was knowledgeable, friendly, didn't hover, and was not pushy at all. He gave us time to order, time in between courses, time to finish the humongous plates of food.  The rest of the waitstaff was also attentive. Having sat outside at the pool all day, my husband was parched, and I think he drank at least eight glasses of water . . . he never had to wait for the glass to be refilled! When I couldn't finish a course, the attendant asked if he could wrap the remaining up to go. I didn't have to flag anyone down.  The food was top notch, bar none!  We started with the ahi tuna tartare. It was a massive appetizer of tiny cubed ahi piled above avocado and what I believe were panko chips. Fresh, flavorful and enough for a table of four (not two) to share! Not knowing how large the portion was going to be, we also ordered an Ocean Club Salad to split - fabulous! And, huge! It had chopped egg, onion, shrimp, lobster, blue cheese . . . you could eat one as a meal. At that point, I issued a proclamation to my husband, aside from our main entrees, we could only order ONE side. Hubby ordered the bone-in rib eye . . . a hunka hunka burnin' love of meat, perfectly seasoned, perfectly seared to medium rare. Bliss for my hubby who gets no red meat at home!  I ordered the Chilean Sea Bass Oreganata . . . melted in my mouth . . . and, it too was a giant piece of fish! I couldn't even finish it. The twice baked potato was delish, even luke warm, as we couldn't even finish it during our meal, but instead had it as a midnight snack back in our hotel room!    One other note . . . and this was pure genius. I couldn't finish my wine. If I put anything more into my stomach, I think I would have exploded! Our waiter said on the way out, take my drink to the hostess and she will give it to me to go. Apparently, the hostess can do this, but the waiter can't. Thinking I am going to get my wine in a plastic cup . . . the hostess actually poured it into another wine glass and told me to keep it!   Without a doubt, this was the best meal we had in Vegas over this three-day holiday. And despite what some would say is a hefty price tag, I beg to differ. The quality of the service and food were spot on. We had dinner at two other similarly priced restaurants and left feeling robbed. Not so at Mastro's Ocean Club.   I think I have finally convinced my husband to make the Scottsdale Mastro's Ocean Club on our regular rotation for fine dining . . . I hope it lives up to the Las Vegas outlet!",

    "text": "I was introduced to Mastro's by a friend of mine.  He had nothing but good things to say about it, so last year, we gave it a shot. Mastro's is the perfect hybrid of really good seafood and classic steakhouse.  When you walk in the first thing you smell is the juicy steaks coming out of the kitchen. This was our second time here and I'm not going to lie, I was a little worried that it wouldn't be as good as I remembered. Lucky for us, it was just as good. I remembered that they had a nice wine list and they still do. Gramercy Guy was able to get Darioush (one of our favorite Napa wineries) by the glass, which is really hard to find.   While our waiter was walking us through the menu, some specials, and suggestions, I zeroed in on a salad called, the Spicy Mambo, which is a take on a Caesar salad, without croutons but has horseradish and blue cheese crumbles. It was really tasty and I'm looking forward to going home and adjusting my Caesar dressing recipe with some fresh horseradish.   A secret menu item is the Mastro's Mash. It used to be on the menu but has recently come off, if you ask, they will make it for you. It's like a loaded baked potato but mashed. We also got sauteed spinach, don't forget your greens.  The design of Mastro's is really amazing, they have what they call a 'tree house', a wooden structure that has two levels. The bottom is the Crystal's information desk and the top level is the Mastro's tree house. When we booked our reservation, we requested a table in the tree house. Once you step inside, the atmosphere totally changes, the band (which is really good) gets muffled and it's very relaxing and feels almost private (there are about a dozen tables).  My advice for anyone going to Mastro's...share...the portions are huge and unless you have a place to store your left overs, it will all go to waste. Also, the pretzel rolls in the bread basket are amazing.

I don't appreciate my waiter giving me attitude just because I don't know half of his fancy schmancy expensive food vocabulary.  We got there last Friday at around 730 PM. The waiter went over the menu with us and began taking order. We didn't know what kind of cooking style we want on the fish. When we asked him questions, instead of him answering patiently, he decided to just give us THE LOOK and say \"i just went over all the cooking style with you..\"BLAH..  The food was salty and whatever..   I don't understand why he's giving me attitude if I still have to pay him tip.  I'm gonna save that money for a nice purse next time.",

I have brought my over-sea clients to this restaurant and the service was 30% of what it used to be.  Our waiter kept chatting with other waiters and it took us 3 times to raise our hands to get his attention for both times.  When I had asked about the types of steaks, he answered as if I was supposed to know that with \"Obviously\", \"of course this type of steak is more firm...\"  we really do not appreciate that.  We pay high price to came to enjoy the food and environment, not to be treated as if it is our job to know the types of food.  The food was good, but our party of 9 people who are all business owners said they liked the food, but agreed that for this class level of spending, the service was very disappointing and substandard.  We did see that services were much better at other tables...seems as if our waiter has a little discriminative to Asians.  As a result, we gave 10% of the service tip instead of the 20% I usually give at this restaurant.  This will be my last time taking clients to this particular restaurant.",

No eye contact when we arrived, no eye contact as we were speaking to her. We understood that there were extremely busy during the time and we had to wait, but interaction with the first person you encounter makes a big difference in your whole experience. The first encounter ruined our whole dining experience. We made the mistake of staying because we were so hungry even though we had to wait an extra half hour even with reservations. We were hoping the service after the first encounter would be better but the whole experience just felt rushed. The food was so so. The one star is for the Chilean Sea Bass which was excellent but the rest you can find at other similar restaurants. For the price you spend at a restaurant such as this, we expected better customer service at the very least.  Would not recommend as there are much better coptions in Vegas with similar menus, much better service, and much better ambiance (not in a mall).",

We ordered the seafood tower and everything was delicious.  For my entree, I ordered the petite filet.  While good, it definitely could have been seasoned more and was a bit overcooked.  Honestly, I think Kevin Rathbun Steak has ruined  every other steak restaurant for me - nothing will ever to compare to the steak I had there.  As a side, we ordered the gorgonzola mac and cheese, which had far more mac than cheese unfortunately.  I could barely taste the gorgonzola at all, and given it's strong flavor, there had to be practically none in there.  Drinks were top notch and the service was excellent.  We sat in the treehouse, which was very cool, but the food just didn't do it for me.  Unfortunately, it just didn't live up to my lofty expectations.",

I ordered the salmon - blackened, lobster mashed and sauteed spinach. Salmon...close to perfection...mashed potatoes good but lobster was a little chewy. $40 mashed potatoes...wow...they were good, but not THAT good. I will admit that the side portions are definitely big enough to share (we had a table of 4). Overall the food was fresh and flavorful and the service was icing on the cake. Troy/Christian brought us out  the butter cake....SLAP YO MOMMA good!!! It looked dangerous just sitting there on the plate, but after one taste...OMG.

After waiting about 15 minutes to be seated, we started with the Seafood Tower because nothing says over the top LV dining like a seafood tower.  On this tower were jumbo shrimp, a variety of crab legs, and some oysters.  Served on the side were a traditional cocktail sauce, their atomic horseradish, and a mustard sauce.  I was a little too liberal with the horseradish sauce and can confirm that the \"atomic\" description is accurate.  For my main, I went with the Ribeye steak and the table ordered a variety of sides: lobster mac and cheese, creamed spinach, gnocchi, asparagus, and au gratin potatoes.    Unfortunately, the highlight of my meal were a few of the sides.  I really enjoyed the lobster mac and cheese, the gnocchi, and creamed spinach, all of which were excellent.  But my steak left a little to be desired.  It was flavorfull, but the piece of meat simply had too much gristle.  I appreciate a bit of fat on my steak, but this piece of meat had just a bit too much on and I had to cut around quite a bit of my meal.  Based on the other reviews, it sounds like my experience may have been out of the ordinary, but from my experience, there are better places to try in LV.",

    "text": "Came with full anticipation of excellent service, great ambience and tasty dishes based on experiences shared by other Yelpers. Left with full satisfaction and lasting impression of a wonderful dining experience. Our table was located in a treehouse with chandeliers and white tablecloth; however, it did not feel stuffy, rather cozy and friendly, with top notch service. Cloth napkins were offered in either black or white color. Hot towels were distributed after we finished our seafood appetizers served icy cold with cool dry ice presentation (their signature seafood tower). Salted caramel martini is deliciously mixed and served in a salted rim glass. The portion is very generous, from the drink, to the bread basket (5 different types), as well as the entree and side dishes. Collectively, everyone in our party was very pleased with their choices of entrees; e.g., Halibut, Arctic Char \"Oreganata\", Chilean sea bass, Vanilla battered lobster tails, Bone-in Ribeye. Side dishes were meant to be shared. The lobster mashed potatoes and Alaskan King Crab Black Truffle Gnocchi were very tasty with big chunks of lobster and crab. Sea Salt & Vinegar Fries were crispy and well-seasoned. The meal ended with the popular warm butter cake and key lime pie. We left in time for Caesar's Palace's Fourth of July fireworks, and others from various Station Casinos throughout Vegas. An epic meal ended with an impressive firework show. What a memorable Fourth!",

We have dined frequently at the Beverly Hills location and thought it would be a perfect date night on our last trip to Vegas to experience their Ocean Club. The location of this restaurant is in the crystals shopping center which is a little bit of a disappointment.  We dined in the tree house which was beautiful but the view of people shopping and the mall did take away from the ambiance, thus the four stars. I am a sweet wine type of girl and had the moscato, which was so smooth and sweet.   For an appetizer we ordered the scallops which were cooked to perfection and tasted amazing. For our entree my husband ordered the chicken and I ordered the bone-in rib eye.  The Ocean club is the sea food version of their traditionally restaurant but offers many of their beef variations.  Most of the appetizers are seafood options but they offer their regular sides with additional seafood options. The mac n cheese and garlic mashed potatoes were great as always.",

    "text": "WOW is all I can say.  We have a Mastros Steakhouse in Chicago and I have not been able to get in as it's always so hoppin. So since we were in Vegas, we decided to give Mastros Ocean Club a try.  We were not disappointed.  The restaurant is located in the City Center shopping area and fits in well with the high end shopping and the swanky decor of the city center and surrounding hotels.  The decor is simple contemporary.  It would be too simple if it wasn't for their amazing bar set up but more their \"tree house\" structure.  If you visit Mastros, request that you sit in the tree house section.  They also have a lounge singer and piano player.  The volume was fine (as I've read other review that it was extremely loud) - but we were sitting in the tree house area so I can imagine if you had one of the tables next to the singer or in the booths behind them, it would be pretty loud.  Regardless, the singer was very good and sang songs from all genres.  Now to the important part - the food.  Everything we ordered was amazing.  As all higher end restaurants, all sides are ala cart but big enough to share.  Our entrees were delishous - ahi tuna, sea bass, and scallops.  I have no complaints, all were cooked PERFECTLY and extremely flavorful.  The portions were quite large.  The sides were equally amazing and big enough to share between 3-4 people.  One of the sides - the mac and cheese was AH. MAZ. ING.  If we're ever back I'd be happy to dive into the Lobster mashed potatoes.  The wedge salad was enourmous, enough to share between 2 people.  I had the lobster bisque which was very tasty.  I've had it before at other places and it sometimes has had a \"fishy\" taste but not this. And there were big chunks of lobster.  Service, supurb as expected.  The menu is pricey, but worth it.  I'll definitely be checking out Mastros in Chicago.",

    "text": "Landed in Vegas and went on a mad hunt for a place to eat with the boyfriend. Wandered into Aria and found this swanky little place. Went to see if they had any tables open. About a 30 minute wait so we decided to do open seating at the bar. We ordered the mussels for appetizer, scallops for the main dish (for me) and steak for the mr. The mussels and the scallops were a little too salty for me, but the texture of the scallops was cooked perfectly. I also felt like I was eating the same thing with my main dish because the scallops came on slices of bread which was the same type of bread that was served to us for appetizer. The portion was quite generous though. The bf and I were trying to guess how many I'd get. I thought maybe 2 big pieces, and he thought maybe 3 moderately sized pieces. The dish came with 5 moderately sized pieces. The boyfriend's 12oz filet, however, was on a whole different level, and I couldn't stop eating his food. Juicy, tender, not overcooked (he got medium rare). It was the best steak the both of us have ever had. Seriously, TRY THE STEAK!",

I have been wanting to go for awhile now but the Vegas location is byfar the prettiest and in the middle of the City Center. The staff was super generous and allowed us to delay our reservation time a few times and still had a table for us. I have been looking forward to these infamous lobster mashed potatoes for awhile as I have only had them once before as leftovers. IT WAS AMAZING! I'm still dreaming about them now... It had a perfect consistency of creaminess and flavor with large pieces of lobster. I had the Chilean Sea bass for my main entree along with the mashed potatoes and mushrooms on the side. The Sea bass had perfect consistency and was huge in portion. It was flaky and cooked perfectly. For dessert, we had the butter cake which was overbuttered in my opinion but was topped off with a fresh homemade whipped cream and ice cream.",

    "text": "Worst dining experience of my life. Came with the family for my son's 21st birthday. Reservation was at 10:00. Main course didn't come out until 2 1/2 hours later. Service was horrible. Food was barely mediocre. I wouldn't recommend this abomination of a restaurant to anyone. I am usually pretty easygoing. I can't even remember the last time I even complained about a meal. Our reservation was at 10:00pm.  We sat in the bar and had drinks until our table was ready at 10:30. We sat down and our server took our drink order while we looked over the menus. The drinks came in short order and then the fun began. We ordered several appetizers, salads and our main courses. The appetizers included tuna so our server told us that he would bring those first since they came out quickly and he wanted them to be fresh for us. They did come out first. About a half hour later. An hour into our meal we were still waiting for our salads. Our server was off working the cash register. I couldn't get his attention so I got up and went over and asked when our salads would arrive. He looked at me like I had two heads and said he didn't know we wanted them out so quickly after our appetizers. Mind you we were now over an hour into our meal and had long since eaten the appetizers which were so so. They finally showed up a half hour later. I got up again and asked to speak to the general manager. The server told me it was all his fault but I insisted on speaking to the person in charge. Eventually someone came up who introduced himself as the assistant manager. He apologized profusely, told us that section of the dining room was running slow and what could he do to help. I said please send out our meals. He looked at me quizically and asked if I really wanted my food to come out right away since we still seemed to be into our salads. I said yes just bring the food. He said right away. A half hour later our meals had not yet arrived. I found our server and told him that most of us had lost out appetites since we were so upset with the service. We wanted to cancel our food. All except the birthday boy who still wanted his steak dinner. It finally came out. He had ordered it medium. It was charred nicely on the outside but when he cut into it, it was so raw I swear I saw the slab of meat start to squirm. We had to send it back. It came back and was cooked to the right temperature. My son took a bite and said it was OK. Some tried a bite and agreed it was very mediocre. He finished and we left. The impression we left with was that they thought we made far too much of our service. In fact we had assumed that the reason the assistant manager came over was that the general manager was not working that night. Not True. She was the woman with the walkie talkie hovering about in the background we later found out. She never once came over and and seemed to have no interest in trying to help us out. Please people, if you have any compassion, boycott Mastros. HORRIBLE!!!",

    "text": "Truly a study of excess starting with the \"tree house\" in the middle of the Crystals Mall.  The excellent food is also a study of excess especially if you are not a huge eater!  Starting with the Escargot, served in the shell swimming in butter and garlic with a wonderful assortment of breads on the side.  Best I have had in a long time.  The entree of Ahi Tuna Sashimi was huge (10 oz.) and perfectly cooked (virtually uncooked!) was a real treat.  The scallops were also more than generous, perfectly seared and served in a wonderful creamy sauce with toast points.  We decided to splurge and went for the $37 lobster mashed potatoes and were not disappointed, only bad part is this really would be too much for a table of four instead of 2 but we managed to eat all the lobster anyway.  Service was flawless.  As you might imagine the bill was part of the excess, cocktails, wine, shared app, entrees with side and a shared desert came to about $260 but it was fun!",

    "text": "I had been intrigued by the scallop-looking building in the sky since the first time I had gone to Crystals when it had initially opened.  I finally went earlier this week, and was extremely impressed with the decor and the service (everyone from the host stand to the waiter -- service is top notch here).  When the menu came, I was in a seafood eater's heaven!!  Their seafood, which ranges from the traditional (tuna, salmon, swordfish) to the the more interesting (opakapaka and chilean seabass), is flown in fresh.... and that's what allows Mastro's to keep the flavors simple so that the fish remains the star on the plate.  I opted for the Chilean Sea Bass and my man went for their jumbo lobster tails.  Brilliance.   The group we were with also ordered almost all the sides on this menu and stand outs were the creamed spinach, the asparagus, and the sauteed mushrooms.   Their wine list is also pretty extensive and the sauvignon blanc was fantastic.   We skipped dessert because we were too full... but the tea we had (they have really interesting flavors, including chocolate coconut) was a perfect compliment to a great meal.  Given the choice between Bartolotta (see my review) and Mastro's, I would take Mastro's any day.  Bravo, Mastro's, on a job well done!!",

I originally booked the table for 7:30 p.m. but as we were running late, I called and asked that our time be pushed back to 8 p.m. and the lady said it should be fine.  We got there at 8 promptly and were seated at the first table by the entrance.  It has its pros & cons.  It's good in that we were sort of in our own corner but bad in that there was a lot of traffic, people walking by and the table next to us was quite loud.  Nevertheless, we enjoyed our dinner tremendously, both the food and the service.  Our server was Rob and we really want to thank him here again for his excellent and professional service.  I hope he will read this review, but if not, I hope other diners will ask for Rob as he is really awesome.  He is very sincere and does just enough to make you feel welcomed and taken care of.  The food was really awesome.  We ordered lobster cocktail, a 33 oz Australian Kobe steak to share and a side of sauteed mushrooms and a bottle of Tomey.  Everything was delicious.  We were on a bit of tight schedule as we have a show to watch at 10 p.m.  at the Mirage and Rob did everything he could to get us of out there in time for the show.  Thank you so much Rob for a wonderful dinner experience!",

    "text": "I just experienced a wonderful meal at this establishment. I would say there was a mid-century modern flair to the establishment, with an extremely classy twist. Our server was a gentleman by the name of Eric Baily, and I use the term gentleman loosely...kidding of course, as this man had a great sense of humor, and would truly appreciate a joke as such. He was amazingly attentive.  Our table was also assisted by many other staff members throughout the meal, who were also very helpful and attentive. Everyone was definitely friendly, and seemed excited about the restaurant and what they had to offer. We also spoke with a bar manager for a bit, Luciana, I may have spelt that wrong :(. She had a radiant personality.  They offer a great cocktail and wine list. We tried a key lime martini...yum, and they had Duckhorn Decoy by the glass, for a respectable price...so I had to try it. The bar is beautiful, several stories in height, layered with a beautiful collage of bottles. There was a great open air feel to the restaurant, yet it still maintained a  wonderful level of intimacy.   Then of course comes the food, solid, simple, and of high quality. Judging from my one experience...that seems to be what they are going for. We had a chilled lobster cocktail and oysters on the half shell for starters. Seriously...amazing oysters...I am in the middle of the desert....eating amazing oysters. The lobster was also great. For our mains we had a steak that came out on a 400 degree plate, hot as can be....I know because I touched it, even after I was warned not to ;P Perfect med rare...perfect med rare for sure. My lady had a crab cake dish... a little ballsy to order such a thing coming from living outside of Maryland for some time. Yet...it was much success...top notch fresh crab meat. I guess you gotta thank modern times and next day air, cause everything we tried was super fresh and very tasty. Again, dishes were very simplistic...but with fresh flavors such as that, you'd only be doing an injustice by masking it with complex levels of flavors.",

We sent the steaks back, they cooked the same steaks, that were already charred and burnt on the outside, when we received them back they were so over cooked it was like beef jerky. The garlic mashed potatoes tasted like box potatoes, runny and flavorless.  Now, for iconic butter cake dessert! We have ordered this dessert many times before in other locations and it was always great, however the butter cake was cold and hard.  I'm not speaking for all Mastros locations but this location was a real let down.",

The taste and texture of the dish is perfection.   Sea bass 3.5/5 - The sea bass was pan seared crispy on the outside, but it was also lacking little seasoning. The dish was a bit disappointing to me due to a lot reviews saying so much great things about it.   Scallops 5/5 - The scallops was my favorite dish of the night. Very much like how the sea bass was cook, and   Brussel sprouts with bacon 3.5/5 - they cooked the brussel just the way I like it. It was crispy in the outside and soft in the side. There was a few piece that was burn and left a bitter taste, but the one that isn't taste very well.   Bone in ryebye 4/5- the streak was delicious , but it wasn't anything speical.  The overall quality and service was amazing. At the end of the night I was highly satisfied!",

Although the designer of this restaurant claims that it is set in a treehouse, it feels more like the dining room of a luxury cruise ship.    Their Caesar salad CANNOT be beat.  I'm a huge fan of the pretzel bread too and apparently my server noticed.  He won my heart by giving me an entire basket of it!  I wish they were still open for lunch.",

Every other fine dining restaurant in Vegas should emulate EVERYTHING that Mastro's does but they won't so Mastro's shall remain the BEST.  I took my 74 year old mom there for her birthday after reading the glowing reviews and she was in tears over how AMAZING her experience was!  They cater to your every need and anticipate them which is what I look for. Never an empty water glass, dishes cleared immediately, food kept coming!    And the fooooddd!!! Appetizer: Mom: Calamari Me: Lobster Bisque=  OH YEAH!  Entree: Mom: Scallops Me: Chilean Sea Bass= Woah Nelly!!!  Sides: Scalloped potatoes,  creamed Spinach,  and those French fries= To die for!  Dessert: Their world renowned BUTTER CAKE!  They wrote \"Happy Birthday\" to my mom in chocolate and gave us this CRAZE AMAZE homemade whipped cream.  We were both so stuffed by then that we couldn't eat that much of the cake but next time I'm not eating for a week before I go!!    Overall,  my mom and I are still both in complete awe over our dining odysey at Mastro's.  I've lived in Vegas for over 17 years and it's actually pretty rare to get service like that here.  There's good service  and then there's MASTRO'S SERVICE!!!",

The Oysters Rockefeller and jumbo shrimp cocktail were delicious. The special \"Tomahawk Australian Wagyu beef\" was tender, juicy, perfectly seasoned, grilled to perfection medium rare! The Twin lobster tails were lightly steamed, preserving their delicate texture and softness! Tasty Garlic mashed potatoes and creamed spinach were the perfect complement to the proteins. We mentioned that we were sharing everything, so the chef pre-sliced the beef and lobster, upon suggestion, to my liking! So high end, so pricey and so worth it!",

We decided to celebrate my birthday in Vegas and what better way than to have dinner at Mastro's in Vegas. We had in mind it was going to be just as great if not better than Beverly Hills, but that was not the case at all. Upon arriving the table we were seated at was so close to the next table it was so uncomfortable I had to apologize to the couple sitting next to us in advance before getting through to my seat, and we were pushed right up against a wall where all the waiters and waitresses are constantly coming in and out of.  Our waiter was nice but he spoke so fast and also had a very heavy accent that we just could not understand what he was saying or explaining to us. My fiance' ordered steak and it had to be taken back twice because it was just too noticeably under cooked. After we ate we were looking forward to having their famous butter cake that we always have upon celebrating a special occasion and we ended up just paying our bill and leaving. We were really disappointed and most likely will not be returning back to this Mastro's.",

The restaurant was chic and the service, cocktails, and food were all first class. Johnny was our server and he was phenomenal. It felt so refreshing to have such amazing service. The food, ugh the food, was exceptional. We shared the crab cakes for our appetizer, which was delicious and made with all crab meat, no fillers. We both had Hennessy sidecars for our drinks. Great choice!!! For our main course, we asked to split the twin lobster tails between the two of us and each was paired with an 8oz filet and petite filet. The steaks were topped with truffle butter. The filets were so tender and the lobster was baked to perfection. We enjoyed the side dishes as well. Our meal concluded with complimentary butter cake and chocolate covered strawberries for his birthday. A great finishing touch to an already outstanding dining experience.",

Highlights for us were the shrimp cocktail, caesar salad, sea bass, big eye tuna and button mushrooms. We also enjoyed the classic martini which was perfection and came with a hefty \"extra\" shaker serving. Everything was truly outstanding and worth every penny. The portions are huge though, so keep that in mind when ordering. They offer half portions of all sides which was a nice touch.

    "text": "I guess I just can't say that I am a fan of this famous restaurant, but hubby is definitely a fan of their steak, so still 4 stars, the service was over the top, and the restaurant is classy and beautiful.   Decided to have anniversary dinner here, we asked to be seated at one of those window seatings in the tree house, our host managed to get us one, it was very nice of her. Started off with bottle of French champagne, loved it, the bread basket was so delicious, just too much for 2 people, it could easily feed up to 5 people seriously! Menu is huge, in addition to lots of choices of steaks, the seafood selections were great too, also sushi items.   Our server introduced lots of things, we decided to do chilled seafood platter first, a little bit of everything on the platter. The presentation was amazing, smokes came out of the prawns container, beautiful and appetizing. The Kumamoto oysters were so good, the lobster claw meat was fairly tender. But the other things were bad, the crab meat was so hard and chewy, the prawns were the worst, they were hard to cut, harder to chewy on, almost impossible to swallow, we couldn't even finish them, so wasteful! The horseradish and cocktail sauces were so good, great with the chilled seafood. It pains me to say that this seafood platter was the worst I have ever had, for a famous steakhouse, that's unacceptable!   Clam chowder soup with garlic bread, our server was nice enough to split the soup for us, even though we didn't ask so. The soup portion was still huge after splitting, too bad I didn't want any soup, so I just gave it to hubby, kinda felt bad for our server's thoughtful gesture.   Lobster roll as my entree, it was so bad, the rice was thick, the stuffings were flavorless, I didn't like the cream sauce on it, I had one and half pieces, and couldn't continue to eat.   12 oz bone in filet in medium rare, the plate was 400 degrees hot! Perfectly cooked to medium rare, the steak melted in hubby's mouth right away, he said it tasted amazing! Absolutely loved every single bite of it!   Side of mushrooms, I love mushrooms so much, but those were so bland, I had one bite, that's it.   So, either my taste buds were numbed from too much drinking? Or Mastro's is really just for steak lovers? My food was just bad... I didn't even eat that much, just sat there, sip on my champagne, and tried very hard not to fall asleep in the middle of a dinner date!   They gave us anniversary chocolate cake with a lit candle, so beautiful, and a huge plate of whipped cream too. The cake was so good, both of us loved it, so yummy! I had a 20 -yr -old tawny ($27) to go with it, it was amazing. It's a famous steakhouse, of course it's pricey. Reserved wine list starts at $100 a bottle, up to 10 thousand. Tab was $350 for two.   To be honest, I didn't like my food, not one bit, dinner experience was good, I was just too sleepy to really enjoy it. Their restroom is located on second floor next to private dining room, the elevator was claustrophobic.    I don't think this place is good for dinner dates, food is too much for two people, impossible to finish everything. The restaurant is too bright, not intimate at all. But it's definitely great for family, group dining, or steak lovers!",

Service was excellent like usual. The only thing was that they messed up on the peppercorn on my fiance new york strip. I know it's the ocean club but all the Mastro's are usually consistent. Can't take away a star for that b/c everything else was amazing. The server even brought complimentary THREE DESSERTs for the table for my dad's birthday. Usually they bring the slice of chocolate cake or the butter cake, but they presented a massive plate with those two and eclairs! AMAZING but prob a good 5000 calories.  Love Mastro's and will def be back to this location next time we're in Vegas.  Thanks for making my father's dinner a memorable one!",

    "text": "It is no secret that I am a huge carnivore. Naturally I constantly get asked what the best steak is. However, one does not simply choose a best steak. True aficionados do not limit themselves to one choice. They are so in love with the subject they want to learn everything about it. So when you ask me for my favorite steak be prepared for a long response. I might ask you what you've liked in the past and what you look for in a steak. There are so many ways to prepare a steak that it can't be drilled down to just one ideal steak.   With that said, Mastro's did not disappoint. It has made it on to my list of high quality eats.  Went on a Saturday night so it was very busy. However the service kept up with the demand quite well. There is a bar with live piano music where you can wait while they prepare your table.  We ordered the seafood tower with oysters and shrimp. Other available choices were lobster, caviar and crab legs. No complaints here. Just great tasting, fresh food.  I wasn't in the mood to have the meat sweats later so I ordered the modestly sized bone-in filet, medium rare. I judge a steak by how it's cooked more than anything else. I like mine almost rare and it was cooked as requested. Highly recommended. Other steaks at my table were the Tomahawk Wagyu Ribeye and the Ribeye. The steaks are huge so plan accordingly if you want to order sides and dessert, and you should.  As for side dishes we ordered the lobster mashed potatoes and creamed spinach. The mashed potatoes had a whole lobster mixed in it and topped with a sauce flavored with the juices from the lobster. Most creamed spinach I've tried in the past were way too buttery but they nailed it here. More cream than butter so it remained thick and didn't fall apart.  The service was first rate as expected for a joint like this. Our waiter, Craig, was professional and gave us a great tip when we asked if he knew a place to get cigars afterwards.   To top it off the hostess sent us a butter cake on the housel! I normally don't order dessert but this cake changed my life.",

The restaurant is pretty cool looking, and the waitstaff was excellent though the hostesses were not very hospitable.  There were 4 of us dining here and we thought the food was not very good.  Bland!!!  I had the bone-in ribeye which is the only steak I order and the flavor was just bland. Another person ordered the Chilean sea bass and we both agreed that it simply lacked flavor.  The lobster mashed potatoes did not taste good to all 4 of us.  The only thing I enjoyed there was the pretzel bread and their warm butter cake.",

    "text": "My wife and I don't often eat at restaurants this pricey but maybe once or twice a year, so when we do we really want to be sure that it's worth it. Some friends of our invited us out and really wanted to go here, the reviews made it sound wonderful so we agreed. The reviews, glowing as they are, don't do it justice in my opinion. Everything from the service to the food to the atmosphere is top notch.   We sat in the treehouse. We'd seen this structure before when we'd walked through Crystals (the mall the restaurant is located in) and had no idea what it was, so we were pleasantly surprised when we entered to find out that the main dining room is located in this unique architectural feature. From below, you would think it's not that spacious, but feels very airy due to the open nature of the design. We didn't feel cramped in any way, and we had a party of 6.   The waite staff are dressed in white jackets and bowties and they are the best at what they do. You feel very well taken care of without feeling watched or \"hovered\" over.   The food is amazing. I won't mince words here, it's expensive and everything is 'a la carte', but the portions are substantial and the sides are easily shareable. In fact, that's the only potential \"negative\" of our experience. We ordered WAY TOO MUCH food, but that's not our server's fault. He warned us but we refused to believe him. The good news is we got to try a little bit of everything, the bad news is we ate a little too much of everything and still had food left over!   I had the Chilean Sea Bass cooked \"oreganata\" style, which was amazing. They really know how to prepare seafood here. It's easy to overcook fish but this was cooked perfectly. Sea Bass is one of my favorite fish and this is easily one of the best I've ever had.  My wife decided to REALLY splurge and ordered one of the specials that was on offer, an 8oz Japanese Wagyu Steak for $125. Words don't do it justice. It was delicious. It melted in your mouth and was just buttery, rich and savory. Not a trace of gristle, every bite was perfect.   Our friends ordered the roasted chicken which was excellent, a bone in ribeye with truffle butter which was almost as amazing as the Wagyu Steak for half the price, and halibut, which was also excellent and perfectly cooked. We started with oysters (I'm not a oyster connoisseur so I can't provide any more detail than that) and for sides we had sauteed asparagus, creamed spinach, gorgonzola mac and cheese, salt and vinegar fries and lobster mashed potatoes (now you see why we ordered too much food). All of the aforementioned items were excellent but the standout was the lobster mashed potatoes. We're not talking about mashed potatoes with bits of lobster flavor, we're talking about mashed potatoes drenched in melted butter with massive chunks of lobster. Seriously, there was not a bit of lobster less than an inch thick in there. It was fantastic.   For dessert we again ordered too much. We had the butter cake (and you should too) which was easily shareable by 4 or more people, but again since I didn't believe the waiter, we ordered two. We also had chocolate covered strawberries and Key Lime Pie, both of which were fantastic, but the butter cake is a standout!   Drinks. The wine menu is extensive and the beer selection was pretty decent too for a \"fancy\" type of place (which in my experience usually seem to look down on beer). The signature cocktails/martinis were delicious and, again, nicely portioned for the price. $17 seems pricey for a martini until you realize they give you the shaker with practically another entire glass full in there for a top off. They also have a nice selection of ports, dessert wines, and cordials for after dinner. I don't usually splurge on an \"after dinner\" drink, but I was in full on splurge mode that night, so I did. The waiter recommended a white dessert wine as opposed to a port since it would pair better with the butter cake, and he was not wrong. I had no idea what was good so I went with his recommendation, which was a Royal Tokaji 5 Puttonyos Aszu wine for $25. It blew me away. It was thick, viscous and sweet but not overly sweet and the flavor was a delicate array of fruit (apricot, hints of citrus and honey) with a creamy, slightly smoky finish. I immediately looked it up online and ordered a bottle for home, which was $50, that's how much I loved it.   I can't reiterate enough how special this experience was to us. Our total for 6 people was a little over $800, but that price seems perfectly justified based on our experience. We would return here without hesitation, although we would definitely listen to our waiter next time when he says we might be ordering too much food, and if we were to show more restraint on our next visit, I think we could get out the door for under $200 (for 2 people). Which as a meal for a special occasion would be more than worth the price.",

We were runing late so I called Mastros to inform them of our situation, when we arrived at the restaurant the hostess said thank you for informing us that you'll be late, we reserved a nice seat by the tree house for you two. She was very nice. She even checked-in my coat.  I love the restaurant ambiance, not too loud and not as cramped as the Beverly Hills location.  I love the different bread choices.  We started our dinner with escargot, which is really good. I love the flaky bread that came with it. We ordered mac and cheese, rack of lamb and bone-in filet. This is not the best steak I've ever had but my steak was done perfectly, medium rare which I asked for. My husband loved the rack of lamb. Lamb serving was huge, he got 2 racks. Mac and cheese was ok. They didn't have porterhouse here not like the Beverly Hills location, since their specialty is seafood.  We had a great dining experience!",

After dragging ourselves over here from Vdara, we finally made it on time. It was an absolute drag because we were awake for 30+ hours & we felt really crappy from all the \"beverages\" we consumed... basically we felt like utter sh** and couldn't enjoy our meals =(  Located in the City Center, the restaurant is pretty much in the very center of the building. Service was good but a bit slow. I love the assortment of bread, my favorite is the crunchy cheesey-garlicky one =)  Here's what we ordered:  Lobster Bisque - comes in a huge bowl, tastes very very VERYY rich, not too many pieces of lobster but still pretty delicious  Seared Sea Scallops - I've had this before at Mastro's in Beverly Hills, same thing, still delicious, comes with 3 scallops & yummy cheese/garlic bread. Scallops from Mastro's comes in 2nd place after Providence's :P   Bone-in Filet - cooked medium. Comes on a sizzling plate, very good rich flavors and good texture. I was only able to eat 2-3 bites. I did eat the leftovers the next morning & it was still pretty tasty.   Chilean Sea Bass - blacken cajun flavored, I think.. It was pretty damn good, texture is very similar to scallops.  King Crab Gnocchi - big enough to be an entree on it's own, holy sh*t, I don't know how this thing can just be a side dish lol it's meant to be shared amongst 4+ people.. I thought it was pretty yummy, I love cheese and king crab meat... but this is super duper heavy, I probably would not order this again...  Garlic Spinach - tasty but a bit too garlicky for me, it was so infused with garlic that it tasted a bit bitter to me..  I am so sad that we were so full that I didn't get to try to butter cake, AGAIN! =( We didn't have much of an appetite at all, plus I think we ordered a little too much lol... we were stuffed after having a few bites of our appetizers.  Service was good, our waiter was a bit slow though. Our water glasses were never empty (thank goodness, we must have drank a total of 13 glasses each..)  Restrooms are located on the second floor, kind of a hassle to look for. Bad idea to go when you're intoxicated..  Lesson learned: do not attempt fine dining after a night of debauchery....excellent restaurant & food! Must try the butter cake one day.... =(",

There was 9 of us for dinner for a friend's birthday, our table was ready and waiting for us when we arrived, they allowed us to decorate the table, the service was awesome, their menu includes steak & seafood so everyone could order whatever they wanted.  The restaurant was very busy I must say and every table had cocktails on it, both are good signs for me.  They have tons of steaks to choose from, lamb, vanilla fried lobster, scallops, and tons of fish. My only confusion came from how the fish was actually prepared b/c there wasn't really on the menu explaining how you can get your fish cooked. After asking the waitress, she explained the 5 fish preparations.  Here's what we ate: 1) Sashimi tower -white fish, Tuna, lobster rolls all very good [see pix] 2) Heirloom tomatoes and burrata salad-very tasty and tons to share 3) Escargot-my favorite very very good [see pix] 4) Creamed Corn-typically not a fan but I did enjoy this very much 5) Brussels Sprouts-eh they are good for you 6) Mac n blue cheese-yes for sure 7) Halibut Oreganata - almost $50, but was a huge piece of fish, definitely could share this 8) the fried lobster was another one of my favorites 9) tuna tostadas again very good [see pix]  I wanted to try the crab cake but didn't have any room left. We had more leftovers in bags then arms to carry them on.  Other notable notes: waiters were exceptional with their service of our table, my glass of Veuve was never empty and the waiter was calling me by name the whole time :). Our bill was over a grand after everything was said and done. So it's on the pricer side.",

My husband and I split a Wedge salad that was perfectly mixed with blue cheese, cheddar cheese, bacon and onions. My husband really enjoyed the bone-in ribeye and I couldn't finish the delicious Artic Char I was served. The double baked potato was gargantuan and awesomely scrumptious, but the best part was ordering creme brulee' and to be served a giant wallop of real whipped cream bigger than the dessert portion!

We were seated immediately upon arrival and we never waited for anything. Our server, Elizabeth, greeted us promptly, explained the menu, and brought our drinks and a warm bread basket. In addition, there were many other \"wait staff\" assisting all of the tables. The minute our glasses were empty, someone was right there ready to fill it. In all of my years of fine dining, I've never experienced service quite like this...not to mention, it was prime time on a Friday evening so it's not like they weren't busy.  Now, aside from the top-notch service, the food was out of this world! The jumbo sauteed sea scallops were cooked to perfection, with a delicious garlic sauce. The filet mignon was so tender, it just melted in your mouth. I've been craving it ever since we left! We thought we were full but when that warm butter cake came out....O-M-G. Best dessert I've ever eaten in my life! All I can say is, it's a good thing we ate here on our last night because I would have wanted to go back a few times! I researched the other locations and found one in NYC. I'll be going there in March and I'm looking forward to another fantastic meal!  I highly recommend this restaurant. I would give it 10 stars if I could...and a special thank you to our server, Elizabeth, for making this such a memorable dining experience",

    "text": "***Short version of this review***  Mastro's is the Cheesecake Factory of fine dining.  --------------------------------------------------------  ***Long version of this review***  I dropped by Mastro's in the Crystals mall for a quick dinner before a night on the town.  I'd heard of the Mastro's chain before, especially their swanky steakhouses in Orange County and LA, but this was my first time hearing of their seafood restaurant.  It seemed like the perfect opportunity to lose my Mastro's virginity without being subjected to massive slabs of red meat.  First thing's first -- Mastro's is enormous, and it's absolutely stunning.  In terms of architectural design, this place is a feast for the eyes.  The interior of the restaurant is bold and stunning.  Much of the dining room is suspended over the rest of the mall in a giant wooden \"treehouse\".  I sat at the bar, which was a veritable mountain of mirrors and glass.  Just being at Mastro's feels glamorous.  After being seated, I ordered a glass of the \"Grace Lane\" Riesling (which was fabulous) and was promptly offered a complementary breadbasket, filled with pretzel bread, toasted baguette, and various other goodies.    I noticed that most of the plates being carted around the restaurants were pretty large, so I decided to build a dinner out of two different appetizers.  I opted for the sauteed sea scallops and the ahi tuna tostada.  Needless to say, two appetizers were more than enough food, since these so-called \"appetizers\" were really entree portions.  The sea scallops included 3 giant scallops, soaking in a rich and buttery sauce and served alongside huge slabs of cheesy baguette.  The ahi tuna tostada was actually 3 separate tostadas, each loaded to the hilt with big-eye tuna, avocado, and ponzu chili sauce.  Of the two dishes, I preferred the scallops, which were simply prepared and oh so silky and indulgent.  The ahi tuna tostada was less enjoyable, since the tuna was served warm and had a slightly mealy consistency.    Service was efficient, formal, and bland -- fairly typical for a chain restaurant, but especially a Vegas chain restaurant.    All in all, I'd really glad I had the chance to experience Mastro's for the first time.  The behemoth portions, straightforward food, and stiff service felt like Cheesecake Factory -- not a bad place per se, but not somewhere that I'd visit on the reg, either.",

FOOD HIGHLIGHTS * Bread basket: Served steamy and warm with Mastro's fresh salted butter. Pretzel bread and cheesy, cracker-like breadsticks were my favorites. * Truffle-lobster gnocchi appetizer special: The chewiest, richest gnocchi I've tried, with tender lobster meat and drizzled with truffle oil. * Bone-in filet steak, medium rare: Soft, tender beef, topped with clarified butter and a pinch of herbs. Served on a 400 degree plate, so it stays nice and toasty throughout your meal! * Butter cake: Devastatingly moist, melty, slightly salty, and of course, buttery, with a crisp crust, a scoop of French vanilla ice cream, and whole plate of freshly whipped cream. Not overrated in any sense of the word.  I'm going to stop writing now because I'll drool all over my work laptop keyboard otherwise...",

    "text": "Overall, this is a solid choice for an evening of fine dining. But there are a few annoyances keeping it from being 5 star.  We walked in with no reservations but it was early and we were sat immediately. We were escorted to a table outside the bird nest, which wouldn't be a big deal if they were not playing the most awful fine dining lounge music ever. After requesting a new table there was some initial resistance but eventually they sat us in the birds nest which thankfully has traditional dining background tunes. - 1 star  The service was quick and friendly though we ordered way too much food. I don't feel we were properly warned about the portion sizes of the side items. There was easily more than a pound of food left uneaten. But what we did eat was good enough to avoid losing another star. Simply put it was all around delicious. Judging by what we had, the dishes I watched go past me, and the reaction of the other diners... close your eyes and pick anything you want... it will be great.  In summery, great food, good service, $$$-$$$$, but-   Unless you want to bring earplugs to dinner, be sure to get a table in the birds nest!",

It's pricey but the steaks are worth it. I read the sides are massive, they were decent. Enough for 2 people in my opinion. I had the bone-in filet and it was delicious. My partner had a grilled fish and it was fresh and tasty. The sauteed spinach was full of garlicky goodness and the asparagus was cooked to perfection. The big bread basket had lots of choices and the chocolate cake was great. The service was impeccable and our waiter was very knowledgable. The only downfall is the location. It's so odd to be at a high-end restaurant in a mall, even if it is a very high-end mall.",

    "text": "This is actually 3.5 stars.  So me and the guys had dinner here last night and as usual the food is excellent (5 stars).    The reason for the lower rating was due to service and ambience.  I've been to other Mastro's and their service has always been top notch.  They always anticipated your needs and followed up quickly.  Our main server here could have worked at Sizzler, Black Angus, Outback or any of those type of places and the clientele there would have thought he was good.  At Mastro's, not the case.    I am a low maintenance client and in the restaurant business so I understand how it can be.  But last night's dinner service wasn't busy and Mastro's has a pretty good wait staff to client ratio so our needs should have been met fairly easily.    My biggest complaint are the lack of water initially and follow up afterwards.  We didn't get water until are appetizers were served.  There was never a follow up after any of the dishes were served.  This is pretty basic service for a fine dining establishment so I will not give you any leeway here.    My other issue is more of a personal taste.  Mastro's is located in Crystals Shopping Center at CityCenter and has an \"open top\" feel with views of the mall.  The restaurant is not enclosed so it feels like I'm dining at a very expensive food court.  As with typical steak houses they are usually dark but here it's pretty bright.  I didn't feel like I had the full Mastro's steak house experience.  While I really enjoyed the food and time with my friends I'm not sure I will go back since Vegas has a lot of dining options.",

Otherwise I was just generally unimpressed. We were put in the darkest corner with no lights so the ambience was a little off to me. All the food was just blah, not bad, but not what you expect for the price. Fried calamari had too little seasoning for me. Seared ahi tuna was pretty tasty I will say, but there was like 4 thin pieces not much to eat. Spicy mambo salad was basically like ceasar salad. Seafood tower was decent and included raw oysters, lobster, crab...the basics. I was going to take pictures, actually I tried, but as I said place was nightime dark in there.

I would not return no matter how good the food just because of the noise level.  The food. We split a Caesar salad, which was OK but too salty and over dressed. We had to ask for some bread. My wife loved her scallops. My swordfish was very thick and looked delicious. It, however, was a little over cooked, and fairly bland. It did not have that grilled flavor I love on fish. The waiter recommended the lobster mashed potatoes ($38), so we got that and the green beans with slivered almonds. If you do not absolutely love lobster, take the $10 baked potato instead. I do not like my veggies over cooked, but the beans were way under done. After dinner decaf coffee was just OK and served in a large cup, but we not offer a refill until we were ready to leave.

I made reservations for a group of friends and I, and despite some initial resistance from my fellow Yelper Lauren M., we all had a fabulous time and were more than happy with our decision to come here!  Our server, Lionel, was amazing the whole evening. He was friendly, helpful, and attentive. He recommended we get a customized seafood tower, and everyone in the group was very impressed.  We were also impressed with our meals. I got the bone-in filet, and two of my friends split the tomahawk special. My other friends got fish. My filet melted in my mouth and was cooked perfectly. I don't typically get filet when I go to a steakhouse, but I was so happy with my meal!   We also got the very popular lobster mashed potatoes for a side, and it was delicious. Lionel brought us out some of the warm butter cake for dessert, and it was amazing! You could definitely smell the butter as soon as he put it down on the table. You must try it if you come to Mastro's!  The setting is a little weird, as you are essentially in the middle of a mall.

On this Labor Day Weekend visit, our initial disappointment, of not being seated in the unique & always fascinating \"tree-house\", was quickly extinguished by Shauna, our Culinary Captain Extraordinaire, menu \"tour guide\" and libation/wine aficionado.  Turns out... our \"Terrace\" seating near the piano bar was as enjoyable as it was entertaining, resulting in yet another \"positively outrageous\" fine dining adventure.  Shauna introduced us to Mastro's participation in \"Las Vegas Restaurant Week\", a worthy nationwide charity drive to raise money for & donate meals to 3-Square Food Bank in Southern Nevada.  She offered a special 4-course dinner deliciously flanked by Beefsteak Tomato & Onion Salad, an 8 oz. Petite Filet, Creamed Spinach & Garlic Mashed Potatoes, and Key Lime Pie all for a reasonable price, part of which was ultimately donated for a worthy cause.    As there were 5 of us on this visit, the aforementioned special meal was joined by collection of our menu favs and Shauna's recommendations. She perfectly paired our appetizers & meals with wonderful Riesling, Cabernet, and Sauvignon Blanc.  Sooo, included in the culinary delight were: The Legendary Seafood Tower (Ohhh YES!!), Lobster Bisque (best in class!), Herb Roasted Chicken (delightful), New York Strip (absolute perfection), Chilean Sea Bass (sweet & outa this world), Sauteed Sea Scallops (Oh Yeah!), Creamed Corn (buttered and seasoned to perfection), Sauteed Mushrooms ( a fav of favs), Roasted Brussels Sprouts (these aren't yo mama's sprouts, believe it!), 1 lb. Baked Potato (huge), Triple Chocolate Layer Cake (nothing but delish), AND...(drum roll)... the Mastro's Signature Warm Butter Cake!!...once again to die for!!!  Without fail, and to paraphrase the writings of T. Scott Gross,... Mastro's was again a \"positively outrageous\" dining experience where the culinary expectations were always far exceeded.  Shauna's unsurpassed service & superior guidance was unexpected, delivered-at-random, fun, entertaining, and so very memorable!  It doesn't get any better!",
