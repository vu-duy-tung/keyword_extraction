    "text": "The overall experience was well-received. The waitress, Jessica, answered my questions and responded quickly to my requests. It was delightful to have such an amazing customer experience with her. The menu comes with the usual assorts of seafood creatures. I ended up with 2 lbs. of crawfish seasoned with Hot n' Juicy and extra spicy. It was good but I expected more of a kick. The Cajun spice was there but I didn't get the effect of volcano eruption from my mouth. I don't think the extra spicy even register on my Richter scale. If you're accustomed to Boiling Crab and comparing it to here, I would say Boiling Crab is spicier. The decor is quite different as well where Hot n' Juicy resembles an America bar and Boiling Crab looks like you got into a shipwreck. I will revisit this place and recommend it to anyone who has an appetite for Cajun seafood.  TL,DR: Good customer service, flavorful but not spicy, ambiance is more modern, recommended for seafood lovers.",

I will go back next time I'm in the area and we tried some more. I will note that it was slow when I was there for a late lunch and the service was fine.",

The hot N juicy special is so tasty you won't regret it (unless you loath spice).  An order of rice is so necessary because the sauce is too good to waste!    The service at the eastern location is on point! I went in for lunch at 12pm and it was not busy (WARNING this place is usually jammed pack) I would recommend coming when the doors open to skip the long wait.  Don't get me wrong eating here is totally worth the wait!   The shrimp was cooked perfectly. The crab is succulent and sweet!  The crawfish is cleaned well and sweet to the taste.  The staff makes eye contact and constantly runs checks throughout the restaurant. Very cohesive team working here.    The atmosphere is nice too. The eastern location has an open feel to it compared to the original location. I Highly recommend this place to anyone looking for a fun and delicious dining experience.",

Just recently moved to Las Vegas and found that there was a new opened location close by to where we had moved!   Excited my boyfriend and I decided to order some for take out.   Flavors were great and the crawfish was yummy! Loved everything about it, but knocking off one star because we didn't get any gloves to eat it with!   It might have been my boyfriends fault for not checking the bag and asking If there were gloves, I mean I know anyone wouldn't really want to get that messy with their hands while eating hot n juicy.  I also called and asked if they provide gloves when ordering take out, the girl over the phone said that you have to ask for gloves when you order over the phone, so make sure you ask for gloves!    If you forget some gloves, just drive down to Walgreens and get your own box, that's what we did lol",

    "text": "I think crawfish is one of those things that people either love or hate. They have a texture, flavor, and look that you just have to get used to in order to enjoy crawfish. Personally, I have only started to try crawfish when it became popular here on the west coast with all of these new crawfish spots popping up all over. And again for me personally, I don't really like getting all messy while eating either, and I don't do well with spicy foods.   So how did I get here to Hot N Juicy with all those personal caveats I pointed out? Of course someone had to have a bday party here and I had to go. But, I do say I did enjoy the food here.  I got a half pound of their garlic butter shrimp at the baby wimpy spice level and a pound of the crawfish of the same seasoning. Butter really does make everything great and although the baby wimpy spice was kind of spicy for me - I drank a lot of water and took french fry breaks between cracking open crawfish and shrimps. Next time I think I will get a potato \"extra\" to go with the crawfish because it looked tasty in my friend's bag.",

    "text": "We were really excited for a new Hot N Juicy closer to our house.  We've been to the other 2 locations in Vegas and loved them.  So, we had high hopes for the new one on Eastern.  The decor looks fantastic, they basically gutted the whole space and it's very modern looking.  Comfortable seating and lots of it.  Quite an upgrade from the previous tenant.  We had dinner around 7:15 on a Tuesday and it was about 3/4 full.  We were seated immediately and a server greeted us within 3 minutes.  Our drinks came out very quickly.  So far so good.......  After this, the wheels kind of fell off.  My wife ordered a half pound of the steamed shrimp with garlic butter.  I decided I didn't want to get super messy, so I got fried shrimp with French fries.  I've had Hot N Juicy's fried shrimp before and loved it, so I didn't think it was going to be an issue.  Well, after about 7 minutes my wife's shrimp was at the table.  I then waited............and waited.  My wife was put in the position of eating her shrimp alone or waiting until my food arrived and then eating a cold dinner.  During this period, while we waited, the waitress basically ignored us.  I think she could tell how angry I was.  25 minutes after my wife's food arrived, I spoke with a supervisor.  She was nice about it, apologized that they were short staffed.  The fries then came out after about 30 minutes.  My shrimp didn't come out until nearly 35 minutes after my wife's food arrived.  This was approximately 40-45 minutes after I ordered.  So, that kind of turned us off to the whole meal.  It may be that my opinion was colored by the experience, but I also thought the food wasn't as good as the Spring Mountain locations.  The breading on the fried shrimp was thicker than last time I had it.  The Cajun fries were good however.    They handled it well, we were only charged for the steamed shrimp in the bag.  The supervisor and our server were apologetic, but like I said, the meal was pretty much ruined.  I think we'll probably give this location another shot, but so far they seem to be having some issues.",

Were were not told this in the beginning so our server was kind enough to split the checks for each party.  Also they auto grat larger parties so watch out for that as it usually not mentioned.  This was the first time dining at a place like HnJ.  There were no prices on the menu for the main courses but they were posted at the register and different places around the restaurant.  I would think a daily printing of the menu with the prices would alleviate squinting to see the price posted across the way and table mates not thinking that your staring at them when your actually reading the menu.  :)  Our server suggested that if it was your first time here to order spice level that is one level lower than you are normal used too!  I myself am a medium level gal all around and decided to just go for it!  I ordered the snow crab legs, medium spice with butter and garlic. After putting on a bib and choosing to dig in with bare hands, the fun begins!  Plastic gloves are available if you choose not to get dirty!  The crab legs were good.  They were fresh! and fun to eat!    I would come back here another time to check out other options!  Give them a try and decide for yourself!",

This time we had a wonderful server who's name escapes me (Brooke?) but she was very helpful. My wife had never been before and opted for a pound of Crawfish. I went with the shrimp (more meat), we shared a dozen pieces of sausage tossed in the hot'n'juicy sauce in her bag, and we also had an order of the corn fritters (a MUST have with your meal). The biggest thing for me was the recommendation from our server to toss my shrimp in the lemon-pepper sauce. It. Was. Awesome.   My wife's only complaint was that the crawfish was a lot of work for little reward, but that's not the restaurant's fault. If you want more meat, get the shrimp. If you want to try new things, get the crawfish or lobster or any of the other delicious things they have. You can either have your fish tossed in a bag with the sauce of your choice, or order the sauce on the side. You also eat with your hands but they do have a washing station near the restrooms if you decide to go gloveless.   All in all another great experience at Hot'n'Juicy. DEFINITELY go here.",

    "text": "All hands on deck! Channel your inner Filipino and partake in the spirit of \"kamayan,\" the traditional style of eating with your hands. That's right, utensils need not apply at this place. Forget your dinner etiquette and fancy silverware. Just simply suit up (with their fashionable plastic bib), bring your ten nimble digits, and dig right on in.   The breakdown:  Step one -- Choose your favorite crustacean or shellfish.  Step two -- Select your seasoning.  Step three -- Pick your poison (i.e., spicy level).  Shrimp is highly popular and worth it. My family and I shared a pound of each of these: Louisiana style, lemon pepper, garlic butter, and the hot n juicy special. We got them on the minimal scale of spice. The last two were my favorite, although it was hard to keep track once we started dumping them onto the communal sea of smorgasbord. Don't forget the rice.  My bf doesn't care much for seafood, so he had the chicken wings with cajun fries, lol. I was surprised they even had poultry... My family also ordered two pounds of king crab legs and a pound of mussels, along with two orders of their pork rinds as appetizers. (Yep, we feasted.) The cajun flavor on pork rind's pretty spicy, but good if you can handle it. Our waitress completely forgot and we didn't even get the rinds until we were practically finished. Service seemed jumbled when we went. Overall, for a party of six, we were all sufficiently stuffed.   Side note: Make sure to rub the lemon onto your hands and let it sit -- this will help alleviate the smell that sometimes will linger on your fingers for a day or two. You're welcome.",

    "text": "Oh yeah ! Let's get down and dirty at hot and juicy ... Calm down, let's keep it G rated.   The restaurant is hot and juicy and when you eat here you better not mind getting your hands dirty.   NOTE: they do provide gloves for you, but I think if you're gonna eat here you need to enjoy the experience, I mean how often is it that you're eating with your hands ??  The food is always on point and the flavor is always consistent.   The family and I prefer medium hot and juicy flavor for everything.  Typically we order 2 lbs of crawfish and 2 lbs of shrimp.  Now they offer 1/2 lbs of food too, so that was a nice addition.     Here's the negative side. Man, this place gets busy,especially on holidays or since right now it's lent and on Fridays Catholics can't have meat .. I think they all decide to go to hot and juicy, just like we did.   Over 45 minute wait.  BAD IDEA.     Now I like I said, the food is consistent, so that's fine, but the service seems to go down the drain when they get busy.   It's like chickens running around with their head cut off.  Our bad experience was that we got all our food, but we were missing a bowl of rice.   3 different servers kept telling us \"the rice is coming, the rice is coming.\"  It literally came when we were almost done eating.   How difficult is it to scoop a bowl of rice ?? I can understand if they told me, we actually ran out of rice and we are making a fresh batch, because it took that long for our rice to come.  Drinks take forever to refill, it's just a mess.  I understand they are busy, but they gotta come up with a better plan for busy days.     TIP OF THE DAY:  Just come here on a regular day, you'll get better service and you'll enjoy the food !!",

    "text": "This was my fourth time in Vegas in the past couple of years and I was there for several days.  I realized that my previous Las Vegas trips have been Strip-Centered.... (I mean \"the\" strip, NOT strip club you dirty minded perv) Regardless I decided this trip to focus my eating on off-the-strip meals and activities and found Hot N Juicy Crawfish.  I had never eaten in a \"Boil\" style fish place.   I had also not eaten Crawfish so this was a perfect experience.   I ordered a sampler which had Crawfish, Shrimp, Andouille Sausage, Potato and Corn on the Cob.   They asked my spice level and I said medium, always seems perfect for me.   I got a beer too although the one beer that appealed to me the most was discontinued.     The meal arrived and it was an impressive amount of food.   Wearing the provided gloves I negotiated the slippery crustaceans and quickly mastered the fine art of beheading and shelling the little bugs.    As I popped them in my mouth they proved to be the freakin' hottest things I have ever eaten!  Holy crap they were spicy.   The fact that my lips were chapped from the dry Las Vegas air multiplied the spice ten fold and my lips went from cracked to blistered.  I begged the server to find me some Chapstick and started looking around the room for moms with large purses...    The waitress said that their heat scale might be a little on the aggressive side and suggested that next time I go with mild or even their wimpy beginner heat level of \"Baby-mild\"   Honestly I might just have to start there.     After all of this why five stars?  Because it was so damn fun!!!   And in spite of the heat it was truly delicious and the portion was more than generous.   I would 1000% recommend it but please communicate with your server exactly what your heat tolerance might be.",

Be sure to ask for the full beer list as they don't automatically bring you that menu.  Unfortunately, when we went, they were out of blue crab. So we went for the Alaskan king crab and shrimp. The shrimp you can order by the 1/2 lb, which is nice. (Everything is minimum 1 lb.)  We went with the garlic butter seasoning with medium spice for the king crab and the hot 'n' juicy seasoning with spicy spice for the shrimp. It is definitely spicy! (And I say that as someone who loves spicy things.) We also ordered the cajun fries (which were loaded with seasoning). (Tip: Ask for a side of ranch for the fries.) The Alaskan king crab legs were gigantic! Some of the biggest I've ever seen (including in Alaska).  All the food was yummy. I liked that they gave you gloves as well as bibs. This really helped IMHO as your hands didn't get covered in sauce and seasoning.  We were never offered another drink or if we wanted any other food. We had to ask for several tools. So like I said, not exactly good service. But the seasoning was on point and the seafood was fresh and yum. So I'd be willing to overlook the service issues and eat here again.",

    "text": "(Edit to update review) We went back to this location last week to give this place another try. After my husband and I wrote our reviews, the manager wrote us back and gave my husband a discount on our next meal. We decided to just go and not tell anyone it was us. It was a busy night, with every seat taken and plenty of staff. Our waitress was really nice, prompt with our food, and even preemptive with our drinks. Most importantly, the food was really good. My husband. And I both got the (get your feet wet) bag filled with crawfish, shrimp, sausage and corn. It was perfectly flavored and spiced.   I think this totally fixed it with us in regards to Hot N Juicy. I'm not sure I would go back a day before a big holiday, like Thanksgiving, but I would definitely go back any other day. I'll also leave up my original post below:  I just moved back to Vegas after 20 years of service in the military. My mom highly suggested we go to Hot N Juicy because it was so worth it. We arrived to the restaurant at 5:40 p.m. on the night before Thanksgiving and were ignored for 10 min. It looked like there were only two servers working the partially empty restaurant and probably the cook who we didn't see. One of the staff members who was working behind the bar eventually asked who was next to the two people who came up after we did and said they had already ordered to go. She looked at us and I just told here we were just sitting here, jokingly. She didn't know what to say, but it would have been nice if she had greeted us. She then promptly told us that we were the last to be seated, because they were closing at 6 pm. My husband and I looked at the door which said they close at 10 pm and we were obviously confused. Also, there were no signs saying they were closing early, so I guess patrons are just supposed to automatically know? She didn't offer an explanation, so I asked if it was because it was the night before Thanksgiving. She said it was and told us to pick a seat, which would have been nice to say to us 10 min ago. My husband was already pissed and wanted to go elsewhere, but I figured I wanted to try it since my mom said it was so good. I'm just not sure she went to this particular restaurant since there are more than one in the valley. After another 10 minutes of being ignored (I've been to places with little staff and the ones with good customer experience will say something to you apologizing for the long wait) my husband and son, who were both complaining of being hungry, got up, took off their HnJ plastic bibs, and left. I was not happy, but I decided to confront the waitress. I told her that we didn't think they wanted to serve us, so we were leaving. She acted apologetic, but I explained that they ignored us for 10 min at the door and 10 at the table. They were obviously understaffed, but again, I've dined places that were understaffed, but still treated their customers like they appreciated their patronage. We ended up going next door to East Ocean Dim Sum and Seafood Restaurant. The lady/waitress/possibly owner greeted us as soon as we entered. I think the Hot N Juicy staff on Eastern could take some notes from next door. Another customer walked in after we did, and the HnJ waitress told them they were closed. If they continue their service that way, then, yes, I think her prediction will come True.  Edit: My husband, who reviewed before me, got a response very soon after he posted from the manager. She nicely offered him a discount and free drinks. I'm still waiting for an acknowledgement of my review, but maybe she assumed we were together? Not looking for a freebie by any means.",

Max constantly checked up on our table consistently filling up our waters and asking if we needed anything else very personable and funny guy too. We ordered the a pound of king crab extra spicy and my were those spicy. We also ordered 2 lbs of crawfish served with corn hot n juicy baby spice lol I love to enjoy my crawfish haha. By far the best experience I had with hot n juicy. Thanks guys will definitely be back.",

We had the Hot n Juicy shrimp, mild heat, and the garlic butter king crab. We also got some potatoes, rice, and because we are fatties- corn fritters. Everything was outstanding. The shrimp with the rice and the lemon rivaled anything I had from famous North Shore Oahu shrimp trucks. Fantastic service and food, and a fun experience. We will be back!",

Before now I would make that nice drive from Henderson to Las Vegas to enjoy boiled seafood at the boiling crab...even though it was nothing compared to the taste of the boiling back home.   Since I tried hot and juicy I have not been back to BC, it might mainly be that it's closer. The prices are a tad bit more but it's worth it. I always get a pound of shrimp hot and juicy medium and a pound of snow crab the same way.  Warning: if you love spice I still say start with the medium and work your way up, their food runs hot! Lol but everyone's taste buds are different but I just know I can handle more spice than most and even I had to relax on the spicy/extra spicy.  Overall great food, I've had decent service times I ate inside, last time I called an order in, they already knew my name which added a personal touch to the order...JUST GO EAT! Lol",

I love that they serve you the food in a bag, right on the table, and that you can pick your own custom spice. The shrimp and crab legs are awesome, but the namesake crawfish are tiny - just ok. Prices are pretty reasonable and you get a ton of food. Don't wear your best shirt - it's messy!",

It's bigger than the Chinatown location and even when it gets packed, there's never much of a wait and service is fast.    The size of the crawfish depends on the season, but nonetheless good every time!  That's the only reason why I'm giving this place 4/5 stars because of the crawfish size.  With 2 pounds of crawfish they throw in a potato and corn on a cob.    My favorite sauce is the Hot N Juicy Special.  You do need your bib...or atleast I do because it gets messy eating with your hands and handling all that sauce.  The sauce is absolutely amazing, and it's finger licking good!  Just imagine tasting buttery garlic lemony old bay seasoning sauce.",

Let me give you a few examples:  the server brought the food to our party of six, one meal at a time, separated over a ten minute period; the waitress omitted an entree in placing the order so that one member of our group got the 2nd half of his meal after everyone else had finished; when the snow crab orders came, they were served without utensils with which to open them.and requests had to be made to supply them.  The food creates a pile of debris that nobody offered to remove until they were asked to do so.   There's a difference between \"hip\" or trendy and this do-it-yourself and you're on your own concept.  They definitely earned the  description as a \"once-in-a-lifetime\" experience!",

Tony is our favorite waiter but honestly every staff member is friendly and they all help each other out so that each table is well taken care of.  NOTE: we love spicy food but the \"mild\" spice level here is plenty. I highly recommend starting with mild and work up to medium if you like. They even offer half pound servings.",

    "text": "Like the idea of wearing a plastic bib with a pocket at the bottom? You know, like the ones you put on infants to catch everything? How about wearing silly giant plastic gloves? If you like playing with your food, ripping shrimp heads off, peeling the shells, and working for your meal, come here.  This is the place to make a gigantic mess that is simply wrapped up in the plastic table cloth and disposed of.  You have wonderful choices of seafood; lobster, black or green mussels, clams, Dungeness, Blue, Snow or King crab legs, shrimp or crawfish- all by the pound. Choose the seasoning you want it cooked in ( butter, garlic, lemon pepper) and then the level of spice. Sides include but are not limited to rice, Hawaiian rolls, corn on the cob, potatoes, etc.   The moment we stepped in the door we were greeted enthusiastically, led to our choice of tables, ordered, and our food arrived unbelievably quick. The restaurant filled up equally fast. Do come early and bring a big appetite.  I don't understand why we don't have a Hot N Juicy Crawfish in the Coachella Valley, CA desert?  I believe there's one in Hollywood and Orange County.  They're plentiful in the Las Vegas area. But then again, I have noticed that whenever something becomes popular in LV, it eventually makes its way here.  Whoever opens the first one in the greater Palm Springs area is going to make a killing.  I double dog dare you!",

I always take family and friends with me so they can try and everyone always loves it! Pricing is as expected for seafood and serving size is standard. I typically get crab legs, shrimp, mussels, corn, potatoes, sausage and a few rolls when i go. You pick your own seasoning and how spicy you want and omg they all are good! My latest visit i got the Hot & Juicy seasoning and Spicy and it was perfect!  Loved everything!",

It's a lazy, rainy Sunday in Henderson and we've been meaning to try this place out. We weren't really in the mood to go out, but alas! Hot n Juicy does takeout!   We ordered a pound of crawfish hot n juicy sauce spicy, a pound of crawfish Cajun style spicy, a pound of snow crab legs in butter garlic mild, and a pound of king crab legs in butter garlic mild.  We're pretty sure the crab legs butter garlic mild turned into hot n juicy spicy somehow...So there's that for miscommunication.   But the food we got was super flavorful & tasty! The sauces are finger lick inducing, & don't forget to rub your meat in the sauce!  The boyfriend ate the crawfish and said it was possibly boiled/steamed to long because the meat was somewhat mushy (but this could be because we had takeout).  That's pretty much the only complaint we had.   Pleased with what we got, & we will go back :)  Also! Takeout tip! They provide you with a plastic table top cover - so thankful. They also offer you gloves. & they have crab crackers (the metal tool, not like a cracker you eat) for sale!",

Three of my friends told me I had garlic breath... next day, all day (more than 20 hours) and I brushed my teeth 5 times and chewed like 100 mints. The scary part is I didn't realize myself I had garlic breath at all... Embarrassing. Not doing this unless I know I stay home all day the next day.  Love coming here for take out! If I call in right before I leave my house, it's ready when I get there (15 min.). Smooth transaction. Never waited. I love spicy food and I'm not sensitive to any spicy food at all, so I ordered mine with \"Extra Spicy\" when I was there for the first time. I got major stomach ache 2 hours later. Be careful. If you are sensitive to spicy food, order \"Baby Spice\" not \"Mild\". If you are super super sensitive to spice, they can also make yours \"Completely Plain\". They just boil with Cajun flavor water and no sauce.  If you remember, I recommend bringing your own gloves (I buy them from Amazon.). The gloves they give you are thin and too big, they break easily while you are fighting with crabs or crawfish to eat.  If I don't have to see anybody next day, I order mine with \"Extra Garlic\" in it... It's very spicy (garlic wise) but I love it!! (Don't do if you have to see someone after or next day.)",

I had family in from out of state and my daughter with me and we were so equally disappointed with the level of service we received. Not only did they rush us to eat but when my cousin requested for her king crab to be sliced or that she be given a knife or scissors to cut it (as most restaurants that serve King Crab do) she was denied and condescendingly asked by a waitress if she \"wanted her to help her to crack her crab\". No we are not children for one, and we have frequented many restaurants like hot and juicy and are just used to either (specifically king crab) the crab either being pre sliced or given a knife or kitchen shears. It was just a bad experience that not only put a huge damper on my birthday but definitely made my daughter and I skeptical about returning to this restaurant as we are now Las Vegas residents. Who serious is going out for a birthday dinner and having the check brought to them 10 minutes after receiving their food. So disappointing!!",

    "text": "Don't wear white, bring a hair tie and come with friends (so you can try multiple bags!) Hot N Juicy is an experience you have to try. No need to drive to Chinatown to get your Hot N Juicy (or similar restaurant) fix. The one on Eastern is just as good.  I'm going to assume you'll order the crawfish (because of the name of the restaurant), but I personally don't recommend it. The amount of meat in the crawfish is about a fourth of that in  the shrimp and the crawfish comes with more body parts (thus heavier non edible part, smaller amount of meat for the same weight and price? NAHHH). Also if it's your first experience the crawfish might freak you out.They look a little.... roach like.  1lb. of shrimp will be enough for one person, 1lb of crawfish won't be. Crawfish enthusiasts will tell you the meat is juicier and to suck out the juice from the head to get the full experience, but to me it tastes the same.   The Hot N Juicy sauce is buttery with a slight kick. They'll advise you that they come out spicier than you expect. We ordered the baby spice and that was perfect for us.  The Cajun fries were way spicier than the baby spice shrimp we ordered and we were unable to finish it. If you're getting a spicy meat, I suggest getting the good ol' regular salty fries to give your palate a break.  We also ordered the calamari (baskets come with fries, calamari is not considered a basket). Good, but it didn't seem worth the price- same price as the lb. of shrimp we ordered.   Quick service and no utensils. Just that alone sounds like a good restaurant to me.",

Our server JanJira gave a very thorough explanation of the menu and made sure we understood the sauces and heat levels, especially since we ordered everything spicy hot & juicy with a side bowl of extra spicy hot & juicy sauce. We like it spicy bordering on a nuclear meltdown - JanJira assured us we would be satisfied.  The crustaceans came out in unassuming plastic bags keeping them stewing in the juicy spicy sauce.   The crawfish were fresh with succulent juice filled heads. If you've never had crawfish, don't expect much meat, just delicious flavor. To order them anything but spicy would be a shame.   Shrimp o' glorious shrimp how I love thee. The shrimp are amazing. Heads ON! Flavor ON! Peel and eat, the side of extra spicy sauce was a good call. Much of the sauce is lost when you peel the shrimp, so the thick side of sauce came in handy to lacquer them with more of the garlicky buttery chili love.  The Cajun fries are some of the best ever. The fries are glass crisp on the outside and steaming soft on the inside. We ordered another after we devoured the first. The fries are perfect to give your mouth a spice break when the heat starts creeping up.  About a half roll of paper towels later with our white plastic drop sheet looking like a crime scene it was time for the check.  JanJira is a fantastic waitress, very attentive and made sure we had a great meal stopping by our table several times throughout the meal for a quick chat.  Next time we will be taking on the crab and a double order of spicy shrimp!!!  Aloha!",

Actually, it's like pulling teeth everytime we come here. They are quick to snap at you for asking a simple request and immediately give you attitude for pointing out something simple.   The last time we were there, the server just could not be bothered with being courteous and spraying herself with body spray. I do not appreciate being smothered by smoke before, during and after I eat in a non-smoking restaurant. It is disgusting.",

The calamari was ok. It wasn't bad but I have had better. I will definitely recommend checking it out for the broiled seafood of you are in Vegas.",

We decided to visit this location because it was the closest and we were starving.  We ordered catfish baskets and corn. The corn wasn't even room temperature so we sent it back.  10minutes went by and they brought me the wrong order, a shrimp basket. I then had to wait 10 minutes for food including hot corn. We got the corn back and the reason we ordered it is because we want more sauce! They put a spoon full of sauce in each container. We complained , nothing was done. Instead we were told to order more food (anything that came in a bag). My friend doesn't order that stuff. We shouldn't have to order more food just to get sauce!! I complained online and the manager offered a free side order of sauce. Wth? No thanks!",

The waitress said their baby spice is equivalent to most places mild, and she was right.  We also tried the Cajun fries which were so spicy I couldn't eat them.  I don't mind a kick in my food but I was choking on how spicy they were, when I mentioned it, staff was super nice and gave us regular fries (no charge)!  We also ordered the soft shell crab Po Boy sandwich......yummy!  All servers are very attentive to your needs, drinks were constantly refilled, every time anyone walked by they glanced or asked if we were okay.  It was such a fun time wearing bibs and making a mess on the table peeling shrimp.  Prices are good, we will definitely be coming back!",

We ordered \"the drool\"... it's a little bit of everything. 1lb of crawfish, 1/2lb crab, 1lb shrimp, a dozen of andouille sausage, 2 corns, 2 potatoes. We ordered in a mild spicy level. It was delicious the sauce is on point and they are not messing around with the spice level. It all had a prefect kick to it. Everything was so good we ordered more.... another pound of crab legs, 2 orders of calamari, & 1 pound of green mussels. Everything was delicious. We ordered 1 order of calamari regular and 1 Cajun. Definitely Cajun was way better. Also had a nice kick to it. Nothing special with the regular. Definitely a fun family experience. Everything wearing bibs, earring off the tables covered in plastic, eating with fingers, no utensils. It was awesome, unique and fun. Definitely will be back",

It is so f'n good too!  The menu is as complicated as multiplication.  4lbs of shrimp/mussels/crawfish x 6 hungry people = happy full smelly handed people.  Choose butter garlic, spicy Cajun, etc. and how many pounds of it you want.  Add some sides like fries or what-have-you.  The seafood comes in steamy saucy plastic bags that everyone grabs into copiously shoveling into their faces until there's a big pile of shrimp husks and heads, shells laying there.  Barbaric hands-on dining which makes for an interesting first date or family dinner.   As a Pescetarian I don't eat any animals that don't breath underwater.  Aside from the few times documented in my previous reviews, that is.  Hot n' juicy is one of those places that my understanding family agrees to go because of my dietary choice.

We wanted a booth and the hostess made sure we got a booth, even though there were other customers ahead of us (give or take that it was a giant party waiting for more tables to be available). The food came in a fast pace & the waitress was attentive and very nice.",

We had 2 lbs of shrimp, 2 lbs of crawfish, 1 lb of clams, 1 lb of snow crab, etouffe, accompanied by sausage, potatoes, rice and corn.   The hot n juicy sauce was outstanding.  The waitress warned us that we might want to order 1 spice level down, but I didn't find it too hot.  I love spicy food and the extra spicy shrimp was not overly hot.  Warning: do not wear anything you don't mind getting messy, you WILL get sauce on your clothes.  We will be back.",

    "text": "The experience of this place was what I enjoyed, not so much the food. Salt, salt, salt. I typically enjoy a low sodium diet with lots of veggies, so you can understand why a restaurant of fried and sodium filled proteins might not appeal to me. But the plastic covered tables and the bibs and plastic gloves and giant bags of super saucy seafood drowning in butter and garlic that you smash and eat with your fingers is just a fun way to spend the evening. I definitely enjoyed watching my friend get covered in seafood and Cajun sauce (literally covered, I was wiping it out of her hair and armpits, though in her defense she'd had 3 beers after an afternoon of champagne).   The service is spot on with the exception of waters. They'd much rather serve you beers than keep the water cups filled. But very friendly wait staff. We had the Cajun calamari, which tasted like spicy Cheetos, and the corn fritters, which were very good. We ate the king crab and clams in garlic butter medium spice. It was too much spice and salt for me and I couldn't help my friend eat the pound of crawfish. Also, the crawfish faces creeped me out. We both were burping garlic for 2 days after.   I personally won't be eating here again. Once home I dove into a salad faster than a fat kid with cake. I'm obviously not their target audience. But I recommended this place to my brothers and I think it'd make a fabulous first date location. What better way to really get to know someone than to see how they handle being showered in seafood sauce.",

For a group of 4 we ordered the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" which has a pound of crawfish, a pound of shrimp, andouille sausage, potatoes, and corn for $30. Alongside that we also ordered an additional pound of crawfish and an order of cajun fries and we had more than enough food to go around. We ordered the combo in garlic butter and the additional pound of crawfish in hot n juicy flavor. The garlic butter is so good! Especially to dip the fries in or to suck the heads on the shrimp -- the only way to eat shrimp!! If you don't have much of a heat tolerance I'd recommend sticking to mild heat or lower because even the medium has a good kick.   We went pretty early, before the dinner rush and the service was quick and friendly. Our group was also all from Hawaii and local music was playing when we went in which we thought was really fun and nostalgic for us. Once prime dinner hours started they switched it off though. Sad faces because we were all really enjoying it!   Overall we had a great experience at this location and will definitely be back.",

Since I have been wanting to each crawfish since my sister shared a pic of a pot of crawfish that she boiled, I told Earl I want to eat crawfish.  We arrived at H&J at 9pm and got seated immediately at one of the booths.  My toddler was in a great mood and was jabbering to the hostess and waitress, saying \"Go Knights Go\" and \"one apple juice please.\"  Unfortunately H&J doesn't have any kind of fruit juices so she opted for water.  I proceed to order 2Lbs of fresh crawfish in the H&J sauce medium.  Medium is quite spicy so by the end of it, my lips were very red.  This order of 2lb comes with a potato and corn.  We also ordered the chicken nugget basket for my toddler.  She ate 4 chicken nuggets and left all the fries behind.    Earl also got the Michelada and it was tasty.  Beer option was either Modelo or Corona.  This Michelda was for $5. So for our dinner, the bill was $42 pre-tip.  Was I satisfied?  Yes.",

Ordered 2lbs of shrimp and a lb of clams. Both with hot n juicy seasoning and spice level spicy. The shrimp was on point, although I could have went up a spice level. The sauce for the clams had too many chunks of garlic and made it overwhelming. Loren was our server and she did very well",

It is completely inappropriate to comment on a young woman's appearance and to withhold seating based on stereotypical commentary. The seating host was offensive to our group and I highly doubt if we had been a group of men the same commentary would have been made. I recommend they review the way they train their hosts and maybe brush up on women's equality. Welcome to 2019.",

    "text": "Been to other 2 locations in town multiple times before first visit of this location. HUGE, BRIGHT sign. really hard to miss =X located next to East Ocean Dim Sum.   Clean and doesn't smell (yet) XD still new.   Service wise. Good and Bad. Their service for seating is bad. Before i had arrived, 2 other parties waited a decent amount of time, to be sitting, instead of standing and waiting. I'm not sure how long they waited but i waited at least 5-10 minutes before they asked, and they didnt ask until a 4th party showed up and stood there before anyone asked. The service in terms of at table, was great. My water cup was never empty (almost usually full, which is surprising for a Hot n Juicy), food came out pretty fast as well.   Food wise, since the last time i had Hot n Juicy (Spring Mtn & Valley View location), had ordered spicy. It was great but a little too much spicy, covering the natural seafood flavor, and my friend's stomach didnt like it too much XD. This time, decided to order medium instead. This locations medium, felt like a mild, if not a little lower. The sauce in the bag, seemed a little watery/diluted as well.   My mistake, i had ordered 3 lb of shrimp, medium, hot n juicy special, in 1 bag. Therefore, we couldnt really reach the sauce. Had asked the waitress for a side of sauce, which she told us they charge extra for sauce, and recommended to get like a potato or something for $0.60 and comes with the same amount of sauce. The sauce that came with the potato, seemed thicker and tastier (to me anyway) so that sauce disappeared quite fast XD.   Overall, good experience. Aside from maybe the spice level difference, it matches the other locations (always worrisome for me, that quality would be different between locations sometimes)   For those who like watching sports, TV's everywhere, doesnt matter which direction you sit. I sat facing the front of the store, and i still had maybe 3 tv's in my view.",

    "text": "I'm being very generous right now with a 2 star rating and this is only because it was only 10 days since they opened this location so I'm giving them the benefit.  There service was very unorganized.  It seemed that the staff was running around with there head cut off.   Let's start with drinks.  They failed to refill my drinks numerous times.  There were a few people responsible to refill drinks throughout the entire restaurant and they had no clue who to service.  The food.  The Pro: tasted the same as the other locations.  The Con: they messed up my order.  Forgot to add my sausage and corn.  In one of my bags they put the wrong spice and mix.  Overall I had to wait at least 15 mins for them to fix the order.  Our waitress couldn't handle the tables she was assigned to.  She was a nice lady but she was very flustered and couldn't handle the pressure.    This location is very nice compared to the rest.  They invested a good amount of money to make it look that way.  There were many TV's all around so it was great to catch the game during dinner.  I will definitely give them another shot after a month to see if they have improved there service.  My suggestion:  perhaps they need to have all the employees play Diner Dash so they understand how to improve there flow lol",

    "text": "There's a reason why there are 3 Hot N Juicy locations in Vegas.   Hot N Juicy is BETTER than Boiling Crab.   I was impressed with their opening weekend. I had a flawless dining experience tonight for the following reasons:  - SHORT WAIT - Don't let the 10-15 hungry diners in the waiting area fool you.  This place has FAST table turnover. - Greeted by server right away and drinks came by a minute later. - Orders were taken promptly - Food came out quick and hot (C'mon it's seafood & fried stuff...there is no reason why it should take long anyway) - Food was flavorful and cooked right! - Convenient sinks in the back for dirty hands. - Less than $20 for dinner for two :)  We ordered the lemon pepper shrimp (medium spice level) 1 lb. $12 and two side orders of rice (generous portions) $2 each  The layout and interior is nicer here compared to other locations.  Be prepared to leave smelling like the aromas of the restaurant & having a seafood or spicy taste in your mouth. Also, no desserts on the menu.  The new location on Eastern is surrounded by many places to satisfy your sweet tooth that it is pretty much a gimme after eating at Hot N Juicy. Frozen yogurt, frozen custard, boba, crepes and waffles. You name it.  Can't wait to get my hands dirty again!",

    "text": "It was once upon when I visited the other Hot n' Juicy location on Spring Mountain and Decatur. If my memory serves me right I had no complaints with the food, the service was fine, and the concept of eating shellfish out of a bag was kind of cool. One thing that I remember vividly of the time was the shower I took that night I ate the meal and how much my hair smelled like garlic and how my clothes were marinated with the smell of the restaurant. Although the food and experience was mediocre, I felt like all the work to get rid of the stench was too much.  Like I said, though, that was once upon a time. The other night, I was in the mood to eat some shrimp; some really spicy shrimp. I was out in the Henderson area visiting the in-laws and I searched Yelp for Hot n' Juicy with the intention of visiting the same location I had gone long ago, knowing full well that I should to gear up for the occasion and what would be required after. To my surprise, however, a location that was much closer to where I was popped up in the GUI and I decided to try it out.  What a great decision! This location has recently opened up I have learned. The inside of the place looks modern and contemporary, they have nice big booths for dining and quite a bit of seating. We arrived right around 8:30 to 9:00 pm and there was about a 15 minute wait, which I was expecting for a Sunday night. There was plenty of open seating at the bar where I would have sat had my wife and I not brought our little niece along to enjoy the experience. There were 3 to 4 flat-screen TV's on each wall meaning if you every wanted to eat spicy seafood while you catch a game, there wouldn't be a bad seat in the house.   Part of the experience was identical to that of the other location on Spring Mountain and Decatur; the tables are wrapped in plastic for you to discard the shells of the fish, gloves are given upon request, no lids for the drinks (although, you may be able to request one), and a little plastic bib to remind you that you hardly need to be careful while you eat.  Another part of the experience, which I thoroughly enjoyed, that I couldn't recall (or perhaps didn't exist) from my previous visit to the other location; there was a nice ventilation system in this place. The air was only mildly filled with the flavorful aromas simmering from their savory sauces.  Ok, now the reason I really wanted to write this review: THE FOOD. I got was I was coming for; I got my shrimp. However, I don't remember the food being this good! I ordered two pounds of shrimp. In one bag we went with the Louisiana sauce \"spicy\" and in the other we got the\"Hot n' Juicy special sauce \"spicy\". Although they were both good, the house sauce was exceptionally good. I found myself dipping the Louisiana flavored shrimp in the remnants of what was once a pound of of Hot n' Juicy Special flavored shrimp. I probably looked like a rabid dog while I sucking out whatever was contained in the heads of the shrimps just to enjoy every last drop of the sauce. I was going to the empty out the bag as a drink, but by that time my wife was already giving me the look that meant I needed to take it down a notch; so I complied.  I walked out of that place a happy man. I didn't smell like I spent a couple hours in a garlic-steamed sauna and I had just enjoyed some of the best tasting shrimp I had ever tasted. Needless to say, I'll be back, and most likely to this location.",

We knew we wanted some hot peel and eat shrimp and some fried fish. We got a pound of shrimp with mild Louisiana spices which was a perfect blend for a shrimp boil. Just the right amount of spice and each shrimp was a decent size. We also got a 4 piece catfish basket with Cajun fries. Fish was good we only had one piece that had the cornmeal breading falling off a little... no biggie. OK, now if you need to order something on the side, definitely get the corn fritters. Little nuggets of fried corn love with a ranch dipping sauce. These are to die for. The service was attentive and filled our iced teas constantly. They had frequent check ins and greeted everyone who entered. Looking around you can see everyone splitting their time well between chatting and getting hands on there shellfish. We will definitely visit again in the future and bring friends.",

Our waitress told us that the \"spicy\" level was really really spicy, but it was still an enjoyable spice in my opinion. The service was great and the food came out fast. Definitely a fun and unique dining experience getting messy and peeling the shrimp/crawfish all over the table. My hands still smell like the sauces from all the peeling, but I don't care because the sauce was so good!",

The shrimp was great and plentiful!  The crayfish were fine (I am not a huge fan, but had to try it).  I think they are too much work for so little meat when paying by the pound.  The spiciness was great and the sausage was perfect to go with the meal.  The service staff was not too educated on their meals because she told me I would have to devein the shrimp.  Luckily I knew better on these type of shrimp and they showed me how to tear up and eat crayfish so it wasn't the end of the world. Otherwise, I was checked on many times for any refills or whatever.  Overall, not a bad meal made to order, but I'll stick to east coast or Louisiana for my boiled shrimp.",

Staff has always been friendly so no problem there, but the snow crab has been old and crummy on multiple occasions and just tasted like expensive garlicky garbage. And the lemons were brown, so old and rotten some of them looked chewed on...I should have took a pic. The shrimp was good though. Another big trigger is the sauce, it is inconsistent, sometimes it comes out sweet and it's not terrible, but if it's going to be sweet I would rather offset that with more spice?...or something, but I really don't appreciate it being sweet out of nowhere, when sometimes it's not, so I don't know what to expect. I want something I can depend on, and this place, it can not be trusted",

We ordered 250.00 worth of food and drinks.. we wanted more but the girl just didn't come back and then when you would try to have someone else get us more food or anything for that Matter they didn't follow through! The worst part was we ordered king crab legs waited 45 mins for them and snow crabs showed up.. then the person that brought them wasn't so nice about it. We know what we ordered but obviously the server didn't. They need more servers and bartenders they seem to be short staffed. The manager seemed to just worry about seating people instead of helping the servers take correct orders or maybe getting guests drinks and being a team player. This place was busy and when someone stood up the busier cleaned the table the hostess sat them. I don't think they needed help.. it was the bartender and servers that needed it.",

But this just made me angry.  We love hot n juicy. We think it's better than boiling crab to be honest.   We hadn't come in about a year so we decided that we wanted that for lunch. After this experience, I don't want to go back.    My husband, sister and I arrived at 2:20pm today to eat. There were 4 groups ahead of us that hadn't been helped waiting to get on the list. A server finally came over and sat 3 parties.   So now there was a group of 2 people and then us a group of 3.   After 10 mins 2 ladies walked in and they were put on a list. They had 7 people in there group.   A big group left that had occupied 2 tables.   Awesome! We thought we'd be next because the two tables would be easy to separate for the group of 2 in front of us and then our group of 3.  PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE tell me why you sat that group of 7 when not all of their party was there?!   The server said \"we are seating large groups first and then seating the small ones.\"  Why? You had 2 perfectly good tables that you could've separated.    This was at 2:48pm  We decided to let it go until they called for a group of 9 at 2:52pm that had arrived no less then 5 mins ago.   That was the last straw. We walked out and decided to go to BJs where we were sat right away.   Long story short, don't go to hot n Juicy with a small group of people because they won't seat you as soon as they can. Come with groups of 7 or more because they are the priority.",

They even give you a bib and gloves so you don't get smelly! Highly recommend!!",

Sauce at other places are definitely better. Prices here are a bit cheaper though. Wish they had bread instead of rolls. Rolls were way to soft and sweet. Corn was not good either, too mushy and not sweet.",

The lobster, shrimp and clams are great. Have to return to try the other menu items. One thing though, after two visits now, we were handed the bill without being asked if we needed anything else. Not cool but not a deal breaker. I'm sure it varies from server to server. Yes, we're going back!",

    "text": "Warning #1: be prepared to smell like garlic awesomeness! So maybe leave anything you don't want to smell in your car...  Warning #2: if you get anything else other than shrimp you'll most likely leave hungry since most of the other choices don't have much meat in them and also the sauce doesn't get through the hard shells as well.   I give 5 stars for the shrimp in hot n juicy sauce. I get spicy level medium, but I always have friends start off with mild because you can easily add spice, but you can't take it away. Warning #3: the shrimp have their full bodies...I love it but my friend had her hubby do the dirty work of breaking them a part.    5 stars for the Cajun fries, but warning #4, they are usually on the spicy side. Sweet potatoes fries are thin and crunchy.   GET THE CORN IN YOUR BAG! You'll thank me! The Mr. gets potatoes too, but they aren't anything special to me.   My bro always gets the oysters and even though I'm not big on oysters they're actually really good here.",

Prices are pricy but hey it's seafood! I've been here the first time they opened and trust me I was skeptical about even returning... But I noticed through time they've improved a lot! Service wise. I mean it's always a hit or miss but you need to go in at a certain time when it isn't so busy. I remember one time I came in and it was slow at first and they got slammed out of no where. So our waitress totally forgot about our table and we waited for our check for half an hour when we finished our food less than an hour ago. Anyways, one of the servers there changed my perspective because he was very attentive and kind. Kudos to the gentlemen who loves spices there! He told us a story of how he would put XXXL spice and ghost chili peppers on all his food in the fridge so his roommates wouldn't touch his food. He definitely made our night and I do apologize for not catching your name. Thank you so much though! I will definitely be returning. I can't deny good food!",

Pretty much the best shrimp \"dish\" on earth.  It's expensive that's why I don't go often, sadly.  This place deserves more than 5 starts. I'd give it 10/5  I adore the sauce on the white rice.

You wait up front to be seated, but at this location the wait is never longer than 3 minutes. After you are seated, they start you off with your drinks, bibs, and if you request for them, gloves.   At this location, they have a new spice level! \"Baby Spice,\" right before \"Mild.\" I always take my order mild, which is only at about a 'hot cheetohs' level of spice, so I'm guessing baby spice would not be spicy at all.  My usual order is a pound of mild, garlic butter shrimp with a side of cajun fries and deep fried calamari. If your skin is sensitive like mine, I wouldn't suggest ordering spice levels higher than mild, otherwise your lips will swell!  The service here is average on somedays, good on most. They once gave me a basket of cajun fries with half of the fries being cold. I usually wouldn't mind, but that order was for my boyfriend's mom, so I asked for them to heat it up for us and the waitress seriously rolled her eyes at me! Lol. Which reminds me they gave us those fries when we were almost done with our meal, so you would probably expect them to be fresh in the first place.  Despite all this, I love Hot n Juicy, and will continue to be a regular.",

You will be seated at a spot in the restaurant with a table top covered directly in plastic, provided with plastic bibs and a roll of paper towels.  There are no plates here, your food comes out straight to you in plastic bags full of wonderful spices and aromas.  No frets here it is very clean.     If it is your first time visiting let the waiter or waitress explain to you have everything works (the staff are very helpful and they know their seafood and flavors).  They specialize in Crawfish but you can have any of the following: shrimp, Dungeness crab, blue crab, oysters, king crab, snow crab, lobster or crabs.  Then you pick a seasoning and a spice level.  That night my husband and I enjoyed shrimp hot n juicy spice level medium, crawfish hot n juicy spice level medium and crawfish garlic butter spice level medium.  Hands down the hot n juicy combo was are favorite, it hits all the taste buds just right and shall I sum it up by saying umami.  The Garlic butter is okay but if I try it again I will get it spicy.  ***If you do order two pounds of crawfish you will receive on corn on the cob and potato in your flavor bag and it soaks up the flavor amazingly.***  The crawfish here are not tiny and their shrimp are a great size too.  We also order their calamari and was pleasantly surprised to find it extremely fresh, it taste like it is hand dipped in their own batter and then fried (not the pre-frozen kind).  If you have children that do not know how to pick crab, shrimp or crawfish this is not the place because you will end up doing all the picking for them and they will do all the eating.",

    "text": "I would have to say my favorite place in all of Henderson/Vegas area.  The Hot and Juicy special sauce is like crack. I love seafood and the sauce just makes it that much better.  I've been a regular at this place for the last year.  I've become friendly with the management and all the staff. I have not had a bad experience yet.   The oysters with their special red sauce are some of the best I have ever had. I've had expensive oysters at fancy steakhouses not as good. I've pretty much tried everything in the restaurant at this point but my favorites are the oysters, clams, snow crab and occasionally i will get crawfish if I am in the mood.    It will be hard for me to ever leave Henderson/Vegas and move somewhere else that does not have one of these restaurants.  In fact I just ate their last night and I still crave it again today.    I first tried the place after seeing Man vs Food on TV. Noemy who was featured on the show still works there. She is super cool, very friendly manager.  I just tried it by chance to say I went there. I had no idea how addicting it would become. The management is great. They always treat us good at all 3 locations in Vegas area.   The only advice I can give you is to wear a bib, wear gloves because you will get messy.  You will smell like the sauce the rest of the night even still so don't plan on leaving your house without showering like 7x.    I usually take all my friends/family that visit me to this place when they are in town when they just want to kick back and have a few beers and eat some good food.",

    "text": "Given just a 1 star for this particular location is for the sake of it's name. Other than that, I would gladly had given a zero if I could. The other two locations on Spring Mountain are well rated because staff that actually acknowledged their customers. Unlike this location.   Was the very first time for my family and I to come here because of distance, so we decided to come here. Came inside, no wait at all, no one greeted us, waited at the door for a good 7 mins, then sat us. Took our order after 10 mins, waiter didn't give us any specials, what they didn't have, what wasn't in season etc... Ordered 3lbs of Hot n Juicy seasoned shrimp mild and 1lbs of Crawfish with same seasoning. Order didn't come out till 30 mins later, without any lemons or butter, not even the salt and pepper. We basically had to ask for everything that was already supposed to be with our orders. Orders of food that wasn't ours kept coming to our table, waiters were confused and didn't know which orders belonged to what table.   Ripped into the bag of shrimp, which was over cooked, but was tasty and little spicy. Ripped into the crawfish and the bag only had 2 big pieces and the rest were about a size of a quarter some even smaller believe it or not. Then asked the server if they had bigger ones they can change for me or exchange it with shrimp instead. She then said \"oh they're not in season\" which she was supposed to mention before we ordered (pass visits in other location) also with Boiling Crab. If she had mentioned that the crawfish was out of season, then obviously we wouldn't have gotten that.   Waiter then asked a fellow co worker (man waiter) on what to do. He came to our table And told us, there's nothing we can do, you can order what you want with the same charges that's on the menu or take it off the bill (very rude). So not only did we wait a while for our food, being the fact that my kids were hungry, they didn't acknowledge or take care of their customer needs by exchanging what we wanted since it was wrong on their end.   At this point I was already furious and wanted to leave, I then asked for the check right away, ruined our whole dinner, and they even forgot to get my check, so I went up to the register waited for them to print out my check, and they also charged me for extra butter and rice that I didn't ask for, but I still paid it, money wasn't the problem on my end. While I was waiting at the register, two customers got up from their seats and asked for hot sauce, forks and spoons. That shows lack of customer service. Something has to be done. Perhaps a more thorough customer service education? I would rather drive the miles than to come back to this place. I WILL NEVER COME BACK HERE. I will stick to Boiling Crab. Happy New Year!",

It would have been better without the lemon pepper in the sauce. The shrimp were large and cooked perfect. It is weird to have the wait staff in a restaurant this small to all be wearing walkie-talkies and earpieces. The staff was very attentive to the guest.

The corn fritters were delicious, the shrimp- \"over the top\" and the service was perfect!!!! Aubree was our server and she was so attentive and friendly!

We were glad that we did.  The menu is a little overwhelming but it didn't take long to figure it out. The waitress helped with the order and showed us how to eat crawfish the proper way. It was good she explained it because my in-laws were a little clueless.  There were many flavors to choose from and we had a big crowd so we chose a little here and there and ended up with a table full of food. It was a massive boil. We had corn, potatoes, and crawfish everywhere.",

    "text": "I have been to all the hot n juicy locations including this one in town and have always had a great experience up until tonight.  My family all had an issue with one thing or another.  My bf had ordered a side of potato and didnt get it with his order.  He had asked 3 times after that and nothing.  My nephew had ordered an ice tea and I had to ask 3 times.  Finally I asked one of the female servers and she brought it right away.  My son asked for more ranch 3 times as well and he gave up p as he already ate his meal.  Then this is the one that really pushed me to the edge...I ordered 1 lb of lemon pepper shrimp and i had basically no sauce in the bag so I informed one of the other servers who then brought it to our server, (dont recall his name) and he returned to my table to tell me, \"thats the correct portion.\"   My bf showed everyone else's bag of shrimp and their's had sauce.  He then says that we can order more sauce for $1.75. Honestly i was asking for maybe 4 to 5 tablespoons just to enough to dip my shrimp in.  You realize that its not going to kill your profit/revenue to give a little sauce.   I get it... we all make mistakes but for that many in one sitting with 4 out 7 in my family is a bit excessive AND to top it off you're going to charge for the sauce when the other server even clearly saw it was barely nothing.   Its very rare that I complain, but you guys could've handled the situation much better than you did.  Being in this business of serving guest, you should always try to put yourself in the guest shoes.  Very important!",

The sauces here were good but I must admit I still favor Boiling Crab's.  The hot n juicy sauce was good but the Cajun sauce had way more flavor and was my favorite.    And now for a couple things that weren't my favorite.  After putting our order in, the shrimp and corn came out in about 10 minutes but the green mussels took about 35-40 minutes to come out. We were already done eating and just waiting around for the mussels. After reminding our server a couple times he finally went to the back to check on it and after that it came out in about 10 minutes so I'm pretty sure they forgot about my order in the back until the server reminded them. After that we put in an order for fried calamari and the SAME THING HAPPENS!!!! The server this time apologized and admitted things were falling apart with the kitchen staff.    Overall the food was ok but the kitchen staff were slow and kept losing my orders so I gotta bring it down a star. Hopefully they get better at managing orders in the back.",

Our waitress seemed like a wonderful person however she was challenged on how to appropriately give exceptional customer service. She was very cheerful and explained the process of ordering, even though we knew the process. We told her we were ready to order and she said ok just a minute, and left. It seemed like she was gone about 10 minutes. We had to wave her down to order. We order a pound of shrimp and one 2lb Dungeness crab and a fried shrimp basket. Well the boiled shrimp came out in about 5 minutes and the jasmine rice. About 7-10 minutes later my sons fried shrimp basket came out. My kids were trying to wait until my crab came out, which came out about 15 minutes later. Can I tell you they brought me a whole crab that was not cracked or cleaned. Which the waitress didn't disclose when I ordered it. In most of the crab boil restaurants that I've gone to in California ask you if you want it cleaned. I am aware that there are people that absolutely love the innards of the crab, I however don't. And had I been told that this how it was served I wouldn't have ordered it. Now not only was it a whole crab but they didn't give me any utensils to crack the crab open or clean it. It was the nastiest $54 crab I have ever had. Needless to say our waitress never came back to check on us not even to bring us the bill. It was so disappointing because my daughter had been to the Chinatown location and was extremely pleased.",

I felt the food was perfect and the spicy level wasn't bad for me, while I'm sure others would think it's otherwise. The shrimp and crab legs came our hot, and were enjoyed thoroughly. I would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I love this type of food. The crab boils and crawfish type stuff. With garlic and butter galore. The spice and flavor here is good here. But the price is more on the top end for this kind of joint. The boiling crab is about a dollar or more less on some items and so is the crab shack. But of $$ is no real problem for you to spend on good food. Then by all means this place is great.   Service with a smile and a lot of attention and refills galore. Making sure everything is going well.  The fresh crawfish was good. Had about 5 dead ones in a 3 lb bag. So that's pretty dang good. The rest are big and juicy well worth the price on them.   King crab is succulent but was rather a bit salty this time around. Not sure why.   The shrimp is good and large and cooked properly.   Cajun fries are my fav here. Not overly seasond with a good amount of crunch. Perfect with ketchup or dipped into your bag of sauce .  Mmm  I'm getting hungry just writing this. That's it y'all.   Enjoy and Stay Wild!",

He said the fish was watered down (clearly it had been previously frozen, yes I know we are far from the beach so fresh fish is hard to find) and the fries were way too hot. My fiance and I ordered the Drool. It was plenty of food! We ordered the flavor Hot N Juicy and spice Mild. So glad I didn't go any hotter because Mild was way to hot and I love spicy food. They need to slow down on the spices. Other then that the fish they used for the baskets were very fresh.  I would return but not waste so much money on a lot of food.",

First of all, I've been to the Spring Mountain locations before.  The food is the same, but the ambiance is totally different.  This Hot N Juicy is bigger, cleaner, and has enough TV screens to keep you occupied while you wait for your food.  If you felt cramped at the other locations, then give this H&N a shot.   I dig this H&J and as for their food, it's messy good.  Present during our dinner was Teri W, Terri R, Tracy P & Hubby, Khatherine & Boypren, Michael K, and Norm K.  We had a great time during dinner and our waitresses were efficient with handling such a big group.  Like I stated before, the food is messy good.  You can't eat here without getting food all over the place. Terri and I shared the 2 lbs of their Garlic Butter Shrimp and White Rice.  My strategy was to peel the shrimp, mix it with my white rice, and try to stay clean.  Peeling the shrimp was a slippery mess and it's a good thing I had gloves.  As for trying to be proper and eating with a fork, that didn't happen.  The garlic butter shrimp with rice was so good that I ate it Pinoy style (with my hands).  The shrimp was seasoned just right and I can't wait to give them a shot again.    TIP:  Don't wear white and use their bib.    PS:   The spice levels can be high by choice.  Ask Michael K.  He went for their hottest flavor.  I can't even imagine peeling that shrimp with no gloves and a paper cut.  Hah!",

I ordered 2 lbs of shrimp (with medium Hot N Juicy seasoning!) while my friend ordered the Soft Shell Crab basket.  One word: Amazing!  The seasoning on the shrimp was just perfect and the basket was way better than I expected it to be. I was skeptical of the soft shell crab basket since I've never had anything of that sort. However, once I tried it, I realized how wrong I was. The batter used to fry the soft shell crab gave it a very delightful taste and the consistency was nice and tender!  Overall a wonderful first experience at Hot N Juicy. The prices are quite reasonable and the customer service was top notch. Big \"Thank You\" to our server, Max, for being patient with us and answering all our inquiries. He was always attentive and was reachable at a glance. Really made an already-awesome dining experience just that much better.",

I ordered a pound of shrimp, medium spice, with the sauce being the Hot N Juicy which is a combination of all their sauces.  you put on your bib and some plastic gloves and when your bag of goodness arrives, you dig in and start taking off the shells.  After awhile, I got really frustrated with the slowness at which I was removing shells.  I took off the gloves and then the process became easier--messier fingers but faster work.  Robin was our main server and she was a GEM!  What a pleasant woman and what a help!  I will be back.  This is one of the things I do by myself unless my wife wants to have fried chicken fingers.

    "text": "Hot N Juicy and MESSY Good!  They're one week into opening over here at Sansone Park Place right next to East Ocean to be exact.   For virgin HNJ Crawfish diners here's the drill:  1. Pick Your Cravings...Market Prices per pound. Shrimp is the only one you can order 1/2 pound of. Make note of the list of current prices posted as you enter.  2. Pick Your Spice Level. ..Mild-Extra Spicy  3. Pick Your Seasoning. ..Cajun, Lemon Pepper, Garlic Butter, and their house blends from what I remember.   4. Roll up your sleeves, tie the bib, and put on the plastic gloves provided for you. There's no dishes or utensils so just dig in!  Since it was my first time here my server guided me thru the menu. My pick: Steamed Shrimp ..Seasoning: Garlic Butter...Spice Level ..mild ..thats all my palate can take. My server read off the sides and Corn Fritter aka Hush Puppies is what I picked. .I don't remember nor did I really didn't pay attention to what else or how much everything was ..my bad.   My order of shrimp came out in a plastic bag nice and HOT.   The shrimp is pretty meaty and when you sink your teeth into it's JUICY!  The MESSY part of is that you get to eat with your hands and do the work  peeling the skin off the shrimp. It's messy but  buttery garlicky good!  The staff did a good job tag teaming. Host greeted and seated everyone in line pretty quick. The servers did great.  I was constantly checked up on. It was a fairly short wait for the main entree to come out. Docked star though because side order came out midway through my meal. I had noted that fried items were a problem after reading some of the reviews here. Looks like the back house  still short a fryer.   The dining area is pretty big. Seating wise it's great for groups.  You have your choice of sitting in either booth or table that's covered in sheet of plastic.   Good thing for laid back atmosphere. Cause using no utensils can get messy. NOTE: There's a sink located just outside the restroom so you can clean . Spent just under twenty bucks for lunch. Super  deal for my meal!",

I usually order the 1lb shrimp or crab depending.  I  order rice, corn and the biscuits to go with it. I also like that you can order half a pound if you don't think you can eat a whole pound .  I like just ordering my food and bringing it home to enjoy without rushing.  I was super happy when this  location opened up its closer to me and I don't have to drive all the way to the  spring mountain.  Prices are reasonable and service is always great and the place is clean.  A bib and napkins are needed for sure as this is an eat with your hands type of place.",

And if I'm super hungry, I'll get crawfish as well in a separate bag just for the extra sauce!  w/ Cajun fries or calamari!!!!! Definitely worth the try if you're a calamari lover like me!

    "text": "I have wanted to dine at H&J for so long, but the other locations are so dang far from me that it just hasn't worked out.  I was SO SO SO excited to see the new location open in Henderson that I set up a UYE.  The restaurant is in a great location, just off the 215 on Eastern.  There is plenty of parking, and although the restaurant isn't huge, they had no problem accommodating our party of 10.  This is a messy, messy place.  Be prepared to be up to your elbows in spicy, juicy sauce!  Don't be intimidated, just dive right in.  Here's the deets:  1.  Pick your \"meat.\"  They sell everything by the pound, according to current market price (posted throughout the restaurant). They have lobster, king crab legs, snow crab legs, mussels, clams, shrimp, and off course crawfish.  2. Pick your spice level.  The waitress said that their sauces tend to be on the spicy side and they recommend going 1 level down to ensure you are comfortable.  If it's not hot enough, they can bring you extra sauce on the side.    3.  Pick your sauce.  They have cajun, garlic butter, and some others, including their special H&J sauce, which is apparently a mix of all of the other sauces.  You can also add sides - the cajun fries were really good.  They also have corn and potatoes that will be added to your bag.  Yes, bag.  Your food will come out in a large plastic bag!  They will also provide gloves if you don't want to get dirty, but where's the fun in that?!  There is a sink in the hallway leading to the bathroom where you can wash up when you are done - what a life saver!  The decor is nice and modern.  There is plenty of seating, with tables in the middle and large booths around the outside.  There was also a bar, but it looked seriously out of place and didn't look like there was anything going on behind it.  Couple of things to note:  They add auto gratuity to large parties.  They will also only split checks 3 ways.  Our server was very friendly and offered to split them up for all of us, which actually created mass confusion and took a long time.  I felt bad for her!  Everyone was super friendly.  If you've been hesitating to try this place out - DON'T.  It's something different that you should definitely try if you love seafood.  Although, they also had chicken nuggets on the menu if you don't!",

Both of us could not take it. Do u know when the food is so spicy u cant even enjoy or taste anything? Like that. We were so disappointed. The mild was crazy spicy, Im glad we didnt bring family with us cause they dont like spicy food and that \"mild\" would've been very embarrassing. Beware of the very spicy food. If u like very spicy u will enjoy it. Not us, we are not going back.",

They peel apart much easier when they're frozen.   We sometimes go with the whole lobster(can't go wrong there) but always get a pond of green mussels, shrimp and snow crab.   I love spicy food, but we usually stick with mild here so that we don't lose the taste of the fish.   Corn fritters are awesome but very filling. For carbs, we usually get a few potatoes or the dinner rolls to sop up that delicious sauce.   Favorite sauces and most flavorful to me are the lemon pepper and juicy Cajun.   Not one bad thing to say about this place! Enjoy!",

We finally made it, as it took a while to find it..but, BOY was it worth it! We ordered the fried catfish. It was fresh and made-to-order.  The french fries (my favorite addiction) were cajun flavored and fresh out of the grease!  We ordered the etoufee (not so great, just spicy) and the get your feet wet shrimp, crawfish, sausage, potatoes and corn boil.  It was delicious!  The sausage was spicy, and my husband couldn't stop eating them.  My favorite was the huge shrimp and the corn (flavorful and simple).  We would definitely come again.  They have other locations (some on the west and east coast), but they have yet to make it to the Midwest...i am hoping that this would change in the near future!  BUT, while we are out traveling, if we happened to see a Hot N Juicy sign, we are stopping and eating!",

When I had questions about the quantity of crab legs in the bag, she snatched it up from the table, rolled her eyes and said \"do you want me to take these back?\"  No explanation or not even trying to satisfy me with an answer or solution. This is the second time I've encountered unprofessionalism from her. Once when I was there, she was outwardly scolding one of the waiters and in eyeshot of customers fussed at him then called him \"white boy.\"  She will not be the one that stops me from going to Hot & Juicy however higher management needs to send her to customer service school or fire her.",

Would go 5 stars because I love it so much but there were a few bumps today with service and food  wait time Was a bit long today for food. My belly was rumbling watching food go out to guests that came in 20 minutes after us.   I'm not a fan of the system where one person takes your order, another runs the food and a random fills your drink. Our server never came back and I felt bad asking just anyone who passed for lemons and my bill. I'm assuming they split tips because it's the only reason I left one after being ditched by our server. They were all polite however.  Today we got   2lbs crawfish . Hot n juicy medium with a dozen sausages. I would say a 1/2 lb was just random claws with no body. Which is no good since they have no meat. I can't wait til spring when they get big! Otherwise they were fresh n tasty.  1 lb of shrimp hot n juicy spicy. Way too mushy. Yuck. This is a problem I have run into at the other location too on spring mtn. You can't even peel them, they just mush up. I actually found myself researching that texture, I thought over cooking makes shrimp tough, I would take hard over mushy any day. It's the reason I switched to crawfish, but when I bring new people shrimp is always a go to. Fix this please!   Plus a side of sauce for dipping... Yum  1 lb of snow crab hot n juicy spicy. Good enough. Fresh. But next time I will spring for the king crab  Chicken nugget plate for the kid. Cajun fries were too spicy for him though. Oops my bad.

I usually go to the Spring Mountain Location and have zero Complaints.. Yesterday however two dumb down.. First when I walked in the hostess up front did not greet me at all instead asked if I had cover up... I immediately looked at her as if she was crazy.. First let me start off by saying I was wearing a Romper my boobs were not out or was my stomach showing.. It was a Romper I got from BEBE.. still no greeting instead saying I will have to ask you to leave if you don't have one talk about embarrassing right in front of my friend.. I'm again like what.. I figured I will just go to my car and grab my jacket but I was blown away.. Secondly my friend had to track down a waitress to refill his drink 3 times.. No one came over to our table once the food was delivered.. Just terrible.. Needless to say my normal 5 star review gets a  one star and that is only because I cannot give a zero star review.. I will not be returning to Hot N Juicy I will switch to Boiling Crab from now on.. Hot N Juicy no no from here on out .. You just lost a long time loyal customer.. No more Hot N Juicy Special Sauce I will now be a Whole Shabang Lover !!!!",

I ate less than a pound before I told my bf I was done. It was just too mushy for me. The rice was also mushy, they used way too much water. Service was alright... We didn't get our limes and salt/pepper until I asked for it. The food took a while to come out. I prefer the Chinatown location, but the fact that this location is literally 2 mins away from me I can't complain. This venue is nicer, I love the open concept. They also have two sinks outside the bathroom, if you just needa wash your hands!   I gave 4 stars because it's still very new, and I have no doubts that they will improve!",

The service and ambiance are all pretty similar to their other locations. Also, they rarely have blue crab now, which I get is seasonal, but even in season they never have seem to have it on a regular basis. Too bad too because blue crab and the extra-spicy hot and juicy sauce is the best thing on the menu.",

I just wish there was an option to get it all in a big bowl with some utensils and another for shells.  I'm  sure the owners are loving it though.  Ship the food in without processing it, money saver!  Boil everything in one pot including your sides, little prep equals saving money!  Serve everything on and in plastic bags, no silverware, even the cups are disposable.  No dishes to purchase or clean.  And after all those savings the food is still sold at a premium prices.  When we go we usually end up paying around $30 or so a person.  Went to the new location on Eastern a couple of times and the service is not good there.  Both times the place wasn't busy and both times it was poor service.  I actually had to get up and go find someone in the back to get drink refills.",

    "text": "Decided to give this place a try and I honestly left without the most important thing.. a full stomach. This was my first time going here and I ordered 3 pounds of crawfish which were 10.99/pound. I ordered two of the Hot N Juicy flavors and 1 pound of Louisiana. The crawfish were large and it was messy and everything I thought when it came to eating them. Only one of my bags had a piece of corn while the other two pounds just had crawfish. I ate them the traditional way where I ate the tail meat and sucked the heads. I ordered butter which was 1 dollar extra. The problem I guess I have is the amount of meat that come from crawfish and the amount of money that will be spent on the amount it takes at least me to get \"full\" is not worth the price of admission. Other than that the main thing the crawfish were actually good and you come for those.. so give it a try .. but make sure you get those bags filled with more corn.",

We walked in and had to wait about 5 min and there was a couple in front of us and there were about 7 free booths. No one even greeted us. We got sat and waited about 10 min, no server to ask for our drink order yet. Many servers walked passed us and did not even acknowledge us. A man walked in and got seated immediately and was asked what he would like to drink. We still haven't gotten acknowledged by any server yet. So we decided to leave because that is just not acceptable. No one even paid attention or saw us leave. Ridiculous!!!!! I was really surprised how bad the service was because the other two locations are awesome. Sad because I won't be coming here again!!!!!!",

    "text": "When my friend told me a \"Hot N Juicy Crawfish\" opened up on Eastern Avenue, I was thrilled!  I've always wanted to go but the other locations were a bit far for me.  So, me, my boyfriend and a friend of mine decided to have lunch here after church yesterday. I'm very happy we chose this place!  We were greeted and seated right away.  The staff was very friendly and attentive, always making sure we were being taken care of and had everything we needed.  Being that it was our first time, the waitress kindly explained the menu to us and told us all about the sauces and their intensity.  We ordered 2 dozen oysters and each had 2 pounds of crawfish as well.  The oysters were very clean and a good size.  With a little lemon juice and cocktail sauce, they were pretty tasty.  I ordered the crawfish with the Hot n Juicy \"mild\" sauce.  I was told that if I liked spicy that I should \"kick it down a notch\" because their sauces are one step up.  They weren't kidding.  The mild sauce had a nice bite to it.  I suggest if you don't like anything spicy, order \"less than mild\" sauce.  The bag of crawfish also comes with a potato and small corn cobb.  We didn't wait long for our food and began our crawfish adventure.  Before digging into my bag of hot n juicy goodness, I made sure to put on the recommended gloves and my plastic bib.  Once suited up, I opened the bag, pulled out one of the spicy crustaceans and went to town.  The crawfish were just like the name says, hot n juicy!  The mild sauce was a bit spicy, but nothing I couldn't handle. I actually like a little fire to my meals.  The crawfish were easy to peel,but very messy.  Thank goodness for the gloves and paper towels!  I devoured most of the bag, leaving just  a small amount on the bottom.  I liked the Hot N Juicy sauce, which is a mixture of all of the sauces on the menu, but I would like to try some of the other sauces on their own. All in all, I was not disappointed.  My friends and I really enjoyed our lunch at Hot N Juicy Crawfish and will definitely be back again real soon!",

If you are ordering from the fried menu, be prepared to wait a while longer for your meal, even if other people in your party are ordering from the boiled menu. Apparently, even just after opening, there is an all-out run on the fryer. My meal did not arrive until well after the other people in my party. They had ordered the shrimp, which was overcooked but basked in the most delicious sauce I had ever tasted. I would give this location a few months to iron out the kinks.  I am returning, as the catfish was delicious, but not when I am under a time crunch. Maybe they need to invest in an additional fryer or prepare themselves more for when the doors open by having the fryers ready to go.",

We ordered two lbs of spicy hot n' juicy shrimp.  The waitress asked if we would like it in two bags I said \"yes please, and some corn in both bags.\" We also ordered some rice.  Our rice came out first and it was SERIOUSLY over cooked.  To the point where it had a weird taste.  A different waitress then came to our table and dropped one bag of 2 lbs of shrimp on the table with no corn.  I then got the attention of a different waitress and asked if we had the right food. I explained to her that the waitress we ordered from said we could have 2 bags of shrimp with 1 lb each and that we ordered corn.  She then took the bag back and came back with 2 bags of shrimp and no corn.  A different lady then brought out two things of corn soaked in sauce. Which was nice even though it wasn't in the bag.  Service was pretty terrible especially when I made it known exactly what I wanted from my initial food order to ensure the waitress would not have to run back and forth with different requests.  The shrimp tasted okay but was kind of mushy.  The rice was gross and super over cooked like I said before.  I will most likely try this location again only because my boyfriend enjoys the atmosphere.",

We have never had an issue ordering Garlic & Butter clams (simply garlic & butter) At this location we got it with the Cajun spices . When we asked the server about the order she stated they do not have a Garlic & Butter selection. My boyfriend didn't want to make a fuss so he was just going to eat it. The manager came over to explain the spices and was slightly condescending but she agreed to fix it and give him the the g&b sauce. OK problem solved...when the clams arrived the manager handed them to him and spoke to him like he was a child and again explained if  you don't specify that you only want g&b you will get the Cajun as well.  He bit his tongue because he was about to lose it.  I was kind of taken back by her tone as well.  When he started eating there was so much garlic that it as difficult to eat.  He was so over it and angry he  just did not want to talk to anyone. He felt it was done on purpose because it had to be remade.  I'm still not sure we will visit this location again as the Spring Mountain Locations have never given us any issues.  We hope they get it together and learn how to talk to customers in a respectful manner.",

Their crawfish are so tiny compared to the other 2 restaurants by spring mountain and they have a really bad service here too! They forgot to serve our rice, so we waited for almost 30 mins to order a new one, and the taste of their sauces was just not very good comparable to the other 2 Hot n Juicy restaurants in Vegas...",

    "text": "My husband and I have been Hot N Juicy Crawfish fans since moving to Las Vegas eight years ago. This new opening was a wonderful surprise! The food is amazing and the service is impeccable, as always. We ordered the Hot N Juicy (medium spicy) seasoned crawfish, which were small and frozen to start with, but had an amazing flavor and texture. The perfect crawfish season is Fat Tuesday (2014 = March 4) thru July 4th - so we are eating these delictable critters at an unseasonable time of year. BUT still quite yummy!  We love restaurants where all of the staff helps all of the patrons, and you don't have to wait for \"your server\" to be notified of your request. This is the perfect example of this customer service philosophy. Not only are you not waiting for anything, the entire staff stops by your table frequently to ask if you need anything. The assistant manager, Katie (totally adorable girl), even stopped by our table to make sure we had everything we needed - PERFECT!   This wonderful addition to the Hot N Juicy chain will not disappoint. If you love Cajun food, you must give your taste buds a treat, and check out this new addition to the Hot N Juicy chain, just south of the 215 on Eastern. Yummy!!!",

This location was not nearly as crowded as the other 2 locations (although soon I'm sure it will be).   I took a coworker with me, it was a first for him and I'm sure this will be a new lunch spot for us...here's why:  Close to work...'nuff said.  I went with my usual...1lb of Snow Crab, 1lb of Shrimp (with Corn and Andouille)  I usually do the Hot & Juicy sauce and get this XXTRA Spicy...I got the Shrimp this way  but the AMAZING waitress, Molly recommended the Lemon Pepper for the Snow Crab. I'm glad that I took her advice!! We also got a side of lemon and pepper on the side.   The food was good as usual but the service here was key!! We were not rushed, beers refilled quickly and she even held a Shrimp seminar for my Hot & Juicy first timer friend which was really cool!! I will definitely be back!!  I will probably try some new things every time I go back but the one thing that I WILL NOT change is where I sat. Molly is the best!!  Seafood, beer, Molly, Seafood, beer, Molly....LOVE THIS PLAY!!  SERVED BY MOLLY AND I'M SWEATIN' ...WHOOOO!!",

You have to call that one a few times to get an answer. The person who took my phone order was great, she made sure she had my order correct by repeating everything to me after we finished, I had a very large order so I was glad she took her time and made sure it was right. When I got there I walked right up and let them know I was there to pick up an order. Everyone was very friendly as they pulled up my ticket so I could pay. My food was already ready when I got there which was great and they made sure I had whatever condiments I needed and also wet naps. The food was amazing as always! I love this location because even though it gets busy everything still is done in a timely matter and the wait is never too long when I actually go and sit down and eat. Great job guys!",

    "text": "Was visiting a friend in Henderson this weekend and we were headed to the Kabob Grill per his recommendation for lunch and I saw this place and got excited. I'm from the south and love me some crawfish and shrimp, fresh only of course. So when he said he has been meaning to try this place after I pointed it out we headed in and asked the important question. \"are your crawfish fresh and where are they from\".... we got a \"yes\" on the fresh part and a \"I don't know\" on the origin. Normally I only like Louisiana crawfish preferably non-farm raised....yes I know I'm a snob but when you grow up catching your own you learn a thing or two about your catch. We moved forward anyway. Since my buddy had never really had crawfish it was fun to show him how to eat them. 2lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Crawfish, 1lbs Hot and Juicy Mild Shrimp, and a Fried Catfish Basket for good measure because my buddy is a big eater and he was afraid that just the seafood would not be enough. Needless to say the table looked like a bone/shell yard when we were done. Which I always find amusing....  Now I am from So Cal so I am a regular at a place called the Boiling Crab which is a chain with the same concept as this one. They fly their seafood in from Louisiana daily and they typically have large crawfish. I'm not sure where this places supply comes from but the crawfish were mostly really small with a medium one here and there. And as everyone knows eating crawfish takes some labor. So small ones make the process of getting full a lot harder. Also becuase they were soo small it was easy to overcook them a little which normally makes their tail ( where all the meat is ) pop off. I felt bad for my buddy because he kept grabbing ones that were head with no tail. He spent the later portion of the meal digging through the bag to try and find all the missing tails..... The flavor was good, not as good as Boiling Crab. But it was worth trying. I typically don't like citrus in my crawfish and shrimp and the Hot and Juicy Special seasoning had some citrus flavor in it. So if you are like me I would go with the Juicy Cajun or Louisiana Style I think, not sure because didn't try it but it sounds closer to what I normally get back here. The spice levels are a little deceiving which is typical at places like this. We discussed this with the waitress and she acknowledged that the medium was on the hot side and so on and so on..... so the mild has enough kick to get you by without not allowing you to taste the meat. Of course if you are a pepper head then by all means....blow it up!  The catfish was different both my buddy and I agreed. Not necessarily bad but just ok. You could tell it was frozen and maybe had not been properly defrosted before it was fried. The Cajun fries were good, better than typical regular fries. All in all it was a good experience.  Oh also if you are not used to eating a lot of butter/oil (which most people aren't) this place will be a little heavy for you. They use alot of butter in their sauces. So if you are like me you just use these places as a treat from time to time. But hey if you can handle it everyday carry on carry on.....",

I love visiting Hot N Juicy when I'm in town and its always a great experience. Its definitely a get your hands dirty kind of place but the food is cooked and spiced exceptionally well.   I normally don't try to get too spicy but you can never tell HOW spicy it will be. There are some days where it'll be TOO hot and some days where its mild. So I took a chance and decided to do a pound of shrimp Hot N Juicy Medium. This day is wasn't too spicy so I ate absolutely everything with no problem.   Of course, I tried using gloves to keep my hands clean but that failed so I opted to go gloveless. To get the smell of seafood off your hands, just squeeze some lemon juice on your spicy saucy hands and wash them in the sink. Thank god this location has sinks in the hall because its always so hard to open the bathroom doors with dirty hands.   No matter what, everything smells like seafood so I would suggest just eating everything there if you can because you don't want your car to smell like seafood.",

We ended up ordering 2 additional chicken tender meals for the kids that TOOK 35-40 To make ! The kids we're SUPER HUNGRY!!! It's was hot mess!!!  The overall service was HORRIBLE!!!!

The experience this day was unlike any other and very disturbing to not only myself but to our friends and family. Our server's name was Jani during this visit and we sat in station 3 with enough chairs to seat 16 people. Jani took our drink requests and then came around and got our food orders with no assistance from any other servers. I ordered the Etouffee, which is a soup like dish, I had never ordered before and Jani asked if I would like to try it first and I agreed. Shortly after Jani brought the taste portion out which was good but extremely hot. I ordered a serving of the Etouffee for me and my wife to share. As we waited Jani brought out our drinks then started bringing out some of the main orders for others in our group again with no assistance from any of the other servers. Since the Etouffee was ordered as an appetizer I only assumed Jani forgot about it and would shortly bring out our main meals. Without warning from Jani I sat back in my chair and at this time Jani spilled the entire foam bowl of scolding hot Etouffee all down my shirt, shorts and on my sneakers. I immediately felt burning on my stomach and leg. My wife asked Jani multiple times for something to help clean this off and was brought out individually packaged wet napkins. Finally my wife was given a towel and she came back to help me get the scolding hot and very spicy Etouffee off of my clothing. At this time my wife saw the marks left on my stomach and leg from the scolding hot Etouffee and advised Jani the food severely burned my body. Jani never offered me any professional medical attention and provided no documentation of the incident even after I asked multiple times. Numerous policies were violated per the companies HR specialist during this incident. Hey, accidents happen but hopefully this doesn't happen to you or most importantly a child. At this point the company has brushed me off and stopped responding. Consumers Beware!",

Marie, the manager is wears the name proud! She is everywhere! From my view in this busy bar, she personally walked to all of us and greeted and ask if were comfortably accommodated. Her personality, professionalism matches and, exceeds my expectations when it comes to customer satisfaccion and most of all quality. Keep up the great work and I will def come back to this hidden jewel. Cheers",

We usually just get it with baby spice, we feel that the more spicy it is, it takes away the flavor of the shrimp. We always order chicken wings too but on our last visit (1/31/15), they were way too salty.   Took one star off because of the service. The waitresses aren't very friendly unless there's a male at the table then all of a sudden, they're too friendly. Just because I don't have a penis doesn't mean I wouldn't appreciate good service. Hope all the men you ladies flirt with tip you well because all you will get from me is the minimum 20% tip and I usually tip 30-40% if I feel that it is earned. Oh well...",

First of all, the nice hostess vanished for several minutes - I assumed she was helping to clear tables but some other guests came in and stood at the front for several minutes (maybe 7?) before the other guests asked us if we had been waiting long. I told them that the hostess was probably clearing a table - why am I making excuses for your business? The food was delicious but then I noticed no one came to check to see how we were doing (and I kind of wanted some hot sauce to go with my catfish). Well, whatever - I just ate my food. But then we waited for 30 minutes before my guy went to ask someone if they were going to give us the check. (I'm a bit emotional about this because something similar happened at Outback the night before and I think these bargain places are going downhill if this is a new trend in going out.) I'm not coming back to this spot.",

    "text": "Me and my wife drove here from Grand Canyon so you can only imagine how hungry we were, I mean... it is a 4 hr drive!  We got in and the nice waitress sat us to our seat immediately. So far so good. She took us our drink orders and after a few minutes we decided what crazy combination of seafood porn do we wanna shove into our empty bellies.  We settled on:  1lb of shrimp 1lb of black mussels 1lb of crawfish(frozen) 1lb of snow crab legs 2 pieces of corn 2 pieces of potato  ... all of this smothered on a medium level hot n juicy sauce, with a side of cajun fries.  Food came out fast, seafood first then came the fries. Cajun fries were fresh to order, crispy on the outside and just the right salted seasoning you would expect. Pro-tip: Skip the ketchup and use your seafood seasoning for the fries, you won't regret it.  Onto the main show. Medium level spicy is definitely spicy! I love habaneros and jalapenos and I though after a few pieces of shrimp, I was starting to feel the fire. The only problem is that it's good you eat through the pain until the only pain you feel is how full your stomach will be.  If you ever had boiling crab, I would say the hot n juicy sauce is very similar to the shabang sauce but it's a little sweeter. I really prefer it to the shabang sauce at boiling crab... it's a shame san jose doesn't have a hot n juicy location...  Overall, great food, great service...oh and the price was great too!   If you're ever in Vegas or in LA, I highly recommend coming here for a meal if you love seafood, cajun boil, and both of them together. You will not regret it.",

Prepare to get messy (which is part of the experience).  I had the king crap legs. Very good. My only gripe is that you spend a lot of $$$ and do not get full. 1 lb of king crab legs cost $34. So for the two of us to eat with sodas cost $96. Pricey and as I said we left still hungry.  Definitely fun and good food and great staff!",

However, I was promptly greeted by a very hospitable guy that took me directly to a table to wait for the rest of my group.  I was then also promptly greeted by our server, and she was as equally friendly and helpful.  Once our entire group was together, the amazing server helped everyone with answering questions and guiding them through the menu.  If you've never been here before, it's an extremely casual dining experience, with great food and service.  The table clothes are plastic, rolls of paper towels on the table serve as your napkins, nearly everything used to serve the food is disposable (plastic cutlery, styrofoam containers), and the main food is served in a plastic bag full of its own sauces and juices. They provide gloves if needed (to handle you sauce coated seafood), because their signature \"HotNJuicy\" sauce is heavy on garlic. The smell of garlic even hits your nostrils as soon as you walk in the door.  Our food arrived very quickly, even though the restaurant was fairly busy, and as to be expected, everything was fresh and flavorful!  You'll LOVE this place!",

The food stayed warm for hours and I didn't need to heat anything up. I ordered 2lbs of shrimp medium spicy and 2lbs of Alaskan king crab medium spicy and potatoes and corn extra spicy. This Is definitely one of my top favorite places to eat.",

    "text": "We've been considering trying this place out for a bit now.  Lets start with the good.    1. The service is great.  Our waitress was perfect.  Very understanding and constantly checked on us.  Not just our waitress but the other wait staff also.    2. The quality of the food was very good.  I've got no complaints about the quality and the quantity.  Loved the taste.    3. Prices are reasonable for the quality and quantity you receive.  Worth the money.    Now the \"Not so good\".  1. The spice is insane! I'm usually fine with Cajun spice and mild, however this place has a new level of mild or cajun that is 2 levels above typical places.  If you don't like spice do not get even a little.    2. Things that should not have spice actually do.  I can understand if I order spice but if I order Oysters the cocktail sauce should not already come mixed with your spicy sauce.  It should come normal, unless I request it.  After the oysters my mouth was on fire.  I had to take a 15 minute break before diving into my food just simply because my mouth was on fire... from oysters.    3. Its messy.  This could be fine but also could be an issue.  Its so messy they drape a plastic trash bag over the table.  Your food comes out in a bag mixed with all the sauces.  You are given gloves to eat your food.  Like I said, this could be fine if you're prepared for it.  If you're not dont go here.    All in all, I enjoyed it.  Next time I will make sure to be very clear to put zero spice on anything.",

Hubby really liked the snow crab. I really liked the shrimp (really prawns) and wished we ordered a full pound. My daughter also liked the chicken nuggets with fries and Hawaiian bread. We also had a tasty basket of sweet potato fries.   Service: Cruz was super friendly and helpful. Even got my hubby another ice tea for the road!  Ambiance: went early (5pm on a Saturday night) and glad we did. That place was hoppin'!  Location: Same plaza as Lee's Sandwiches.",

    "text": "First time here and definitely will NOT be the last! Hot N Juicy Crawfish is located in the same plaza as the BJs on the strip of Eastern and is not difficult to find. Parking lot is shared with the whole plaza but I have not had a hard time finding a space yet.    Came here on a Friday afternoon around 5 PM and was seated at a booth as soon as we came in. There were already bibs, napkins, and menus at the table which was great. We were also offered gloves when our server came by. I've been to a restaurant similar to this and I was excited to see how amazing it was going to be based off of all the pictures and reviews.  They have a menu which lists their items and then a separate menu that has how much each item would be for half a pound or a full pound. I got a pound of the shrimp in their signature \"hot n spicy\" sauce in mild which was a combination of all three sauces - can't remember what they were all called though but it was mouth watering. Also ordered their Cajun fries which were seasoned to perfection!   Customer service was excellent - multiple employees came to check up on us and were always refilling our waters and our sweet teas. Can't wait to be back!",

I'm not knocking this place as some people like their food this way. I did however enjoy snow crab baskets. They aren't big enough to share but totally worth it. (13.99 each). The staff was very accommodating to let me exchange the crawfish for a snow crab basket. My husband and I did eat the shrimp because we love shrimp no matter what. It's in full shells with eyes too.

Had jessica & Rick as servers and they made the experience fun, energetic & making us wanna come back tomorrow!! What topped it off compared to the other places was that they give you gloves to use (I have a cut on my finger so didn't want to get the sauce on it) and they have sinks outside the bathroom to wash your hands! Oh AND the whole ambiance and feel of this location I LOVEEE!! It's interior design was so nice and clean and the fact that it wasn't busy made the experience so relaxing while we ate!!

    "text": "So happy they opened one on my side of town!  When we got there, there were still tables open. We had a party of 8, but the guy server refused to seat us until at least half of our party was present. Which the eighth was a four month old baby that wasn't even going to eat. It was understandable until the tables started filling up and the only table left was ours that a girl server purposely left reserved for us. Instead of the guy server out of courtesy asking us if the rest of the party was here, which they were, but were trying to find parking, (the parking isn't that great in this plaza by the way) he was pretty darn close to just seating the next party that arrived. I felt that was rude in and inconsiderate as we were patiently waiting. The least he could have done was ask if they were here or not. They could have been walking to the door and he probably would have just seated the other party if it weren't for my husband telling the girl server that our party was parking. That was frustrating.  We finally sat down and ordered. When it came to us waiting for the food, it was taking a lot longer than I had experienced at the other two Hot N Juicy's on Spring Mountain. We were probably waiting about 45 minutes to an hour. We only ordered shrimp and the rest were chicken baskets. The other two would have the food out a lot quicker.  Definitely no more than a 20 minute wait after ordering.  Every time we needed something we had to keep looking for our server as he never really came to check up on us.   At this location, I felt the service was about a 1 1/2 stars. I love the food and the location which bumped my rating to 3 stars. I love how they have a sink in the hall to avoid the clutter in the bathrooms. I would choose this location as my least favorite out of the three, but since it's less than 10 minutes away from where I stay, I will be returning for that reason.",

The food was good  the atmosphere great, the service is what is lacking. We were seated and then asked if we wanted anything to drink, I said no because I would like to see the menu. Well no one came .  We waited and waited.  I said we would wait 2 more mintues and then we would leave.  Finally were served.  Food took forever even though tables that were seated after us received their dinner before us. I never knew who my server was. They all asked or stopped by the table. But never when I needed them. It's too bad.",

This place offers affordable and delicious seafood!  My friend and I both got 1 lb of shrimps each (with heads on). Each pound was $13 which was pretty affordable. We both got them in the Hot and Juicy special sauce which I highly recommend by the way! The waitress was very accommodating and service was very quick. We had such an awesome meal and I couldn't ask for anything else better. This place is a must re-visit when I come back to Vegas in the future!",

Catfish had a wonderful taste and the fries were well seasoned--no salt required. Our server answered more of our questions about some of the other meal offerings, which encouraged us to return and try some other foods. If you enjoy seafood, this is the place.  If you enjoy Cajun food, this is the place.",

We did get mild because the waitress said their stuff is spicier than average, and I was glad because it was spicy as hell, but the sauce was delicious. The corn was over cooked in the bag and there was what seemed like too much shrimp vs crawfish. The beer and micheladas were only $5 so cant beat that for a strip restaurant. Wouldn't go again, but gave it 4 stars for the sauce alone. My husband did like the snow crab legs in the bag - we got the combo bag.",

I order a pound of a shrimp which is about $12 a pound today with lemon pepper sauce and mild seasoning. The rest of my family order a couple pounds of crawfish with a really high spice level.  The sauce was really watery when I received my bag of shrimp. It was still tasty and I enjoyed every single piece of shrimp they gave. I was hoping the sauce would be thicker to stick on the shrimp better.  When I sampled a couple of my families crawfish, the spice level was too much for me. I am not really into spicy food so be aware of the spice level you choose.   The customer service was okay. A little bit slow on refilling on drinks and hard to find a server to ask for a few condiments such as ketchup.  Overall experience was good. I'd come back here whenever I crave seafood and to try out their different seafood and sauce.",

I'm not one to cause a scene, but I had to flag down a server and let her know I wasn't served as yet. Food finally arrived with no offer of gloves, but Taylor made it right by quickly getting me a setup. It was a poor start, but thanks to Taylor, I might stop in and give this place another try.",

First of all, I could smell the seafood when I opened my car door! It smelled so good! We walked in, and I noticed there was white plactic on all of the tables, and no silverware. My first thought was that this was going to be an interesting dinner.    We were seated really quickly. We arrived around 9, and they close at 10, so the dinner rush had already come and gone. Our server was named King, and he was great. He explaned the menu, made some recommendations, and explained how to order. We decided on 2 sets of the meal that came with 1lb of shrimp, 1lb of crawfish, corn, potatoes, and sausage. One we chose the hot and spicy seasoning on baby spice, and the other was the garlic butter seasoning also on baby spice. Glad we picked baby spice on both, as even that had a little kick to it!  The server brought out the food, and it came out in plastic bags, and super super hot! We dug in! Being newbies to this place, we honestly had no idea what the shrimp came whole hahaha my son's girlfriend and I laughed and gave each other a look when we realized we were going to have to shell and pull the faces and legs off!  The food was awesome. The corn was the best corn I have ever had. The potatoes were kind of bland, but the fish was so good. I personally liked the hot and juicy flavored sausage the best, but the garlic butter corn and shrimp.   I am totally going back for a date night with my husband. I would highly recommend! Oh, and they give you a bib, and offer gloves if needed :)",

The fried calamari appetizer is really good, too. When I order the shrimp, I get a whole pound and I can finish it no problem. If I get an appetizer, than I just get 1/2 pound.

Everyone is nice, professional, and we never had to ask for drink refills or ask twice for anything.  I get everything with Hot n Juicy sauce (mix of all the sauces) mild. I love the king crab, cooked perfectly, sweet, and juicy. The lobster was mediocre, over cooked, and rubbery. The shrimp is easily my second favorite, cooked to perfection and absorbs the flavor well. The crawfish is definitely not worth it in my opinion. (I'm from New Orleans so I have high standards for crawfish.)  It's definitely worth trying at least once. And as others said, be ready to get messy!

    "text": "We were in neighborhood and craving spicy seafood boil, decided to give this place a try. We've been to Boling Crab (BC) in LA and few others like it so this isn't our first time. They're located in huge strip lot which offers ample parking. I was surprised how big the place is inside. There are a lot of tables, and booths, plus large bar counter. They were able to accommodate our party of five quickly.   Since it was Cinco de Mayo, we started off with a some micheladas, which were delicious. Good size portions for $8. The fried calamari was tasty, but I had better. We had 2 pounds each of the shrimp, mussels, and blue crab with half-dozen corn, potatoes and sausages. For seasoning sauces we got their the famous \"Hot N Juicy\" Special, done medium spice. All seafood arrived in separate bags with exception to corn, potatoes and sausages which were combined. Everything tasted delicious and we plowed through everything pretty quickly. Quality of fresh seafood and flavors were good. Spice level was on point without being overbearing. Along with bibs and gloves they provide, I still end up getting it all over myself. I don't think the plastic gloves is suitable on crabs because they puncture quite easily. I ended up removing it.  Overall, food was delicious and the service was great. The staff checked on us regularly and was efficient. We will definitely be back .",

My party of 2 got there just in time. It was fairly empty when we arrived, but by the time our food came (which wasn't long) it was almost a packed house. The tables already have a cover over them and bibs and gloves are waiting for you.   Service was pretty good. Our waiter asked if this was our first time there and went over the menu with us. I had already checked it out online so I knew what I wanted to order. We started off with delicious margaritas and Hawaiian bread. Next we order a la carte with 1lb of snow crab legs, 1lb of shrimp, sausage, 2 corns and 2 potatoes all in the hot and juicy sauce with a spice level of mild. Our waiter warned us that their spice levels were a step above the normal and I'm glad I listened and stuck with mild. I love spicy food and that was a good first choice. Everything was delicious. I should've ordered more potatoes and corn because 1 was just not enough. It would be nice if they had a 3 for $2 type of deal for the corn and potatoes.   Expect to get messy. Roll up your sleeves and enjoy!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try a seafood boil for a very long time and finally got around to coming into this crawfish joint. They have medium and large seafood boils with Cajun or varying seasoning. We chose the Cajun seasoning. It was spicy!! I got 4/10 for spice level.  I also enjoyed the Po' boy and realized maybe seafood boils are better enjoyed in bigger groups. I loved the food, but my hands and breath did have a strong garlic smell all day afterward. Nonetheless, they give you gloves and bibs to avoid spillage and messiness. I'll come back with a bigger group to avoid taking leftovers home. I'll definitely have another po' boy then too. Come to eat if you enjoy family style seafood at a good price, and aren't afraid to get a little messy.",

I usually get half of the shrimp with the hot and juicy sauce medium spicy. I got spicy on our first visit and it was way too spicy for me. The shrimps have been very fresh and they're pretty decent size. I also add the sausage - they're sliced thinly. I love how they give you options to get half a dozen or a dozen of slices sausages.   We tried out their catfish fried basket the second time we were there. We got 4 generous pieces and the breading is not too thick. You can get them with regular fries or Cajun fries.   We'll definitely come back here if we crave seafood.",

    "text": "Came here for lunch with my sisters and cousins. I had been here before, but that was years ago. There was not a big difference to the seafood in the Bay Area.   I had ordered one pound of shrimp. Mild level spice and Juicy Cajun seasoning. I had also ordered one corn and one sausage. The sauce was thick but not runny. I thought it was a bit spicy even though I got mild. I didn't use the gloves because coming from the Bay Area, we typically don't use it lol!   My sister's bf was allergic to shellfish and the waitress said that they reuse the same oil for ALL of their food. So unbeknownst to us, there was nothing on the menu he could eat! The waitress said that he could order outside food and bring it in the restaurant and eat with the group. I thought that was nice of them.   So caution to anyone who is allergic to seafood. You won't be able to eat anything. Not even the fries!   For those who aren't, this place was not bad. Good service, good food and pretty clean.",

Peel and eat Shrimp are the easiest to eat, for the payout on the work.  Crawfish are tasty but it's a lot of work for the amount of \"meat\" you get.  Crab is crazy hard bc it's gets really messy. Thank goodness they have a sink that's outside of the bathroom to wash up.  Service is always friendly and prices are great.  Normally shrimp ranges from 11-13 a pound.

There was a group of 13 of us so we understood that there would be a wait and we went around dinner time so the wait was not a problem.   Once we finally got seated, it kinda took awhile before our waitress came over but she finally did and took out drink order. She was really nice and even made the exception to split the check as they are restricted to how many times the bill can be split which was awesome.  I ordered a pound of shrimp/ CAjun spice / medium, green muscles/ garlic butter / medium, corn rice and calamari. My food came a last from everyone else which I was kinda annoyed but it was okay, the calamari held me over a bit till then. Once my food finally came out, I started peeling my shrimp. They give u gloves and a bib, which I recommend u use. The shrimp was really good a juicy however, I didn't realize the medium was spicy. I was able to handle it however next time I will need to order the mild. The muscles was pretty good too, they gave a good amount. Our waitress was good too, she came by often to make sure we was okay and refilling our drinks when needed.   I would come back here again, however next time I will order mild haha.",

    "text": "Super happy and grateful that they have a location in my area! It's in a plaza off of Eastern & 215, specifically -- Eastern & Richmar, which is filled with a bunch of other popular restaurants, but I've gotta say, Hot N Juicy is at the top of my list for lunch or dinner.   This was my first time at this location, can't believe I haven't been here sooner. I've had my fair share of boils, at their Chinatown location and private events.   We went on a Sunday afternoon, lunchtime, about 2pm. I thought it would be a long wait, it was fairly busy but we waited 10 mins before we were seated.   Compared to the Chinatown location, this one is bigger and spacious. I liked the booth seating and big windows to people watch.   I'm so glad we ate here for lunch since I've been craving shrimp lately.   We ordered the \"Get Your Feet Wet\" special, which came with a lil' bit of everything -- crawfish, shrimp, sausage, corn, potatoes. With Cajun seasoning and medium spiciness.   The seasoning was ok, the spice level was just right. I wish I asked about popular seasonings. I'll have to try those next time. The cajun wasn't bad, but it felt like it was missing something.  The food was delicious and the service was friendly. Our waitress was smiley and checked up on us often. I'm sorry I don't remember her name.   My only complaint was that the shrimp were hard to peel. Possibly, over cooked. We were there at least 2 hours haha, but I was in good company.   We ate all the shrimp, but not the crawfish, corn and potatoes.   Next time, since I'm on the Ketogenic diet (also diabetic), I would order the shrimp, sausage, green mussels, crab, instead of the special.   I would definitely come here again, and bring my out of town guests, friends and family. They have ample seating for large groups.   Tip: There are sinks set up right outside the bathrooms, to wash your hands after you eat!  2018 Yelp Challenge Review #12",

She said we make last call at 9:45 and the kitchen already closed since they didn't have anymore orders. Meanwhile they quickly turned off the open light. Every other restaurant and business doesn't close until their actual closing time (have worked in restaurants many times). Definitely will not be going to this location again. 3rd time I've come here and the service and staff are not friendly and inviting like the other locations.

To order some catfish and fried shrimp?? There was a large party but it wasn't a party of 20-that I can understand. No follow up as far as beverage refills and when it did come around, we got water added to whatever we were drinking. Regardless of what it started out as. This place is cool if your food is To Go-otherwise? I'd frankly go elsewhere....... Will SO not be back-especially at those prices and level of service.",

Typically get 2 lbs shrimp in garlic butter or a medium hot n juicy with a dozen sausage and side order of rice. HNJ delivers a consistently good experience.  Perfect for watching football or any sport with all their TVs. Will be back on our next seafood craving!",

We waited 15 min for our sodas and then were served them twice because of miscommunication between the servers. We order crawfish, rolls, and crab legs.....crawfish came right away.....we had to ask 3xs for our rolls....and were told our crab would be out momentarily. We eventually got our rolls we asked for buter and were tolf they only had melted butter not cold. After 45 min they asked did we need anything else and we said we are still waiting for our crabs. They went to check and the kitchen forgot to cook them. So after another 20 min they finally came out and we were told they would comp the crab. When we got the bill we were still charged. We had to go find the original waitress (as we had 4 different ones) and she was like oops. So after they fixed that with the manager we finally left after being there for close to 2 hours. Like i said great food just not the best service. Woukd definitely do take out nect time.",

We chalked it up to just opening.   Tried it again last night. Service is BAD. Several people did come to check on us. however after asking for my husband's rice THREE times we finally got it at almost the end of the meal. The sauce for some reason is absolutely not the same. We both ordered snow crab, one with garlic butter mild, one with hot-n-juicy mild. Very little sauce in the bag and the taste is just different. The crab was not as fresh it seemed either. We both became sick last night.   It was so different that when we left I called the location on Spring Mtn to see if it was the same owner. The girl on the phone was very nice and said yes. She advised me to place a YELP review and then someone would contact me. We will only be going to this location from now on, but I do hope they fix this one. If this is the first location someone tries I doubt they will be back!",

This young blonde girl who started as our waitress (I told them to not send her back) seemed to be on drugs or left her brain at home. We ordered 1 lbs of baby spice shrimp butter garlic, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium, 1 lbs of lemon pepper medium with corn, 3 rice, 2 waters,  and 1 unsweetened tea. First she brought me raspberry tea, corrected her it was unsweetened tea, brought it to me with sugar on the side. Smh. Food got here and got about 1 1/2 lbs of the butter garlic that was the complete opposite of baby spice. Then the other 1 lbs bags were about half a pound, and one was missing corn. Had to constantly ask for refills on my tea. My auntie wanted the least hot spice, and got the hottest on the menu, no wonder she was so miserable by the time we finished. I will NEVER come back to this location,  now as I'm writing this and get my check, she brings my check with charging me 4 lbs. Looking for the GM. This place is a joke. Stand by..... Ok so GM tried to fix the ticket and messed that up. Ended up leaving being charged for 2lbs, 3 rice, 1 corn. Sure hope this GM can turn this place around.",

    "text": "The seafood was very good, correctly cooked, and seasoned nicely.  We had the combo with crawfish, shrimp and sausage with corn and potato in the bag.  The seasoning was hot and juicy spicy.  We also ordered the fried catfish with cajun fries.  The crawfish was very good, but as usual with crawfish, you don't get much meat.  The shrimp was very meaty, however, and cooked just right.  I wouldn't order the crawfish again but would do the shrimp.  The sausage was a good addition, but nothing special.  The potatoes were perfect, but the corn was overdone and mushy.  The fried catfish was again cooked perfectly, but we are not fans of the cornmeal coating (although it was again well done).  The cajun fries were prepared nicely with a good crunch.  I probably wouldn't buy the hot and juicy the next time as a little drier would probably work just as well.  But then again, I was licking my fingers so it couldn't have been that bad as it tasted great.  1 lb. of shrimp is a lot of food and you should plan on sharing unless you are a really big eater.  We took the rest of the shrimp home and had it for lunch cold the next day.  It was still much better than you would find at any grocery store and the seasoning was still good.  The service was also very good.  If you are a seafood person, this is one place to go.",

The prices are so reasonable and the staff is nice. It's neat how you eat the food, the table is covered in plastic for easy clean up and they bring your food out in bags and you get a bib and gloves because it will get messy (In a fun way!).

Half of my shrimp was all mushy and I definitely lost my appetite. When my shrimp came in a bag, it was very securely tied at the top with a layer of two bags; that tells me that it's been in that sauce for way too long. I was super disappointed. The waiters we had were super attentive, although one of them seemed to be in a hurry because she kept grabbing the check when we haven't paid yet and asking if the check was ready when clearly we were still eating. Very unhappy with the hot n juicy on eastern, maybe the one on spring mountain is better. I used to like hot n juicy better than boiling crab but now I'm not so sure.",

If the seafood wasn't so good I'd give this place 3 stars. Took them 40 min to get our food out, and on top of that they kept forgetting orders!  All together or took over 2hrs to dine here. .  Never again,  I will be ordering to go from now on in this location.  Ps, to the server I dislike,  stop acting so fake cause everyone knows it.",

We came for lunch around 3pm, and were unable to order until about 20 minutes after being seated. It proved quite a difficult task trying to attain our servers attention when we had simple requests, especially for such a large venue that was not busy at all. Compared to the Spring Mountain locations, the cajun sauce is quite runny and not as thick and rich like the other locations. They barely put any sauce on the crab legs and the crab legs still seemed a bit cold. I was highly disappointed with this location, both times I've been here! Word of advice - you'd be better off sticking to the Hot'N'Juicy locations on Spring Mountain where the food quality is remarkably phenomenal and the service is top-notch.",

We also ordered rice, cajun fries, sausage, and chicken nuggets. I usually try to stay away from pork but I had to give the sausages a try. They were really good in the H&J sauce.

The manager was also very nice and attentive by asking how everything was and did we like the food! I would only change two things which is why I rated this place 4 stars instead of 5:   First, we had to listen to music that wasn't really that bad for adults (I guess) but if we had our children there, it would have been bad. Other people had small children dining with them and songs like \"Bubble Butt\" and \"Pass that *ss\" just isn't appropriate for children. Secondly, please brew your own iced tea instead of using the raspberry tea from the soda fountain. Places like Wendy's, Panda Express and Rubio's all brew fresh iced tea and they are considered quick serve restaurants not full casual dining like you guys. But other than that, we loved our meal and were very happy. We will be back again!",

Not sure if this location is owned by someone different than the other two in Vegas because it was a not-so-good experience. Everything from the service, to the food was just meh.  My absolute favorite thing about Hot and Juicy is the fries, oysters, snow crab, and the corn. Starting off the with cajun fries, the tasted the same - no difference, but how can you really screw up fries??? Next, the snow crab. It was sooooooooo BAD!!! There was no meat inside, it was smaller, the meat was so salty it made me want throw up and the white part of it looked moldy and disgusting. It was green and black, so disgusting and it left us with a sick stomach. As we were breaking them, there was never any meat inside of them. What's the point? This place is expensive and to get empty snow crab seriously enraged me. Next, the oysters. I' was pleasantly surprised with the oysters. They tasted very fresh and didn't even need hot sauce to slurp down! Lastly, the corn. It just wasn't good. Period. The kernals were small, it wasn't juicy and biting into it felt like it was just all core.  All of these lead me to believe that the owners are different because it seems like they're using all different things. I say, stick to the chinatown locations. Haven't been there in a while, hopefully things haven't changed.",

And it's not like it was a busy hour, there was numerous amount of empty seats. A young lady ask if we were being helped after standing for a good few minutes and I said no. Matt, slowly set up our table and asked us how many and I said 7. We get seated and my cousin asked for waters all around. He did not ask \"can we start you off with anything to drink?\" He literally stood frozen like hello say something. And he had to count how many waters when I said in the beginning there was 7 of us. Him and the other team members were working slow except for this one guy who was not wearing a name tag. He seem Pacific Islander.

Never eaten here before so \"Dixie\" our server was helpful in explaining the menu to us and even showing us how to open the crawfish. The crab legs were my favorite. Very large and flavorful. The service is what stood out to me. Dixie was always stopping by to see if we needed drink refills, more gloves, items cleared. She really did a great job! I'm not a huge fan of cajun spices so I can't say I will go here a lot, but it was a fun and new experience and the seafood was cooked perfectly!",

The hot and juicy seasoning was very delicious but I think next time I will try the lemon pepper. The shrimp didn't really absorb the flavoring as well as the crawfish did. I will definitely return. Service was excellent, especially Jessica! She was attentive, personable and more than made up for the slacking of some of the others. Its too bad they pool tips because obviously others are riding on the backs of others (Angela).",

The waiter came and said, \"we only have 4 left for the night.\"  We said, \"ok no problem, bring the four.\"  The waiter said, \"Let me check with the manager and see if I can sell them to you.\"  We said, \"ok\".  Mean while we were talking amoungest our selfs discussing how weird it was that he wouldn't just have offered us the oysters for free beings they only had four left.  He came back said stated he could not sell us the oysters as it would screw up there inventory.  WTF????  Are they planing on saving them till they get their next shipment to be able to complete a order of 6 or 12?  It's situations like this where customer service is completely ignored because someone be it the waiter or manager didn't have the balls to make a judgment desicion.  I only give this place two stars because the craw daddy's we did order were very good.",

Went there to eat horrible spice is inconsistent the waitress forgot our food like 3 different times they didn't get the order right at all not by the end of the night. My king crab which I paid $27 a pound for was cold inside on some and overl cook and mushy on others. anybody you write a good review about these places is not a qualified diner. They probably don't eat out much money do they probably eat somewhere like Long John Silvers. This is a horrible place at both locations completely rotten service with super poor quality food",

I ordered one pound of shrimp with the hot N juice seasoning.  This is basically a combination of all of the four seasonings that are offered.  The hot N juicy seasoning has a very unique taste that I didn't particularly like.  I did however LOVE the fried shrimp.  The breading that was used was spicy cornmeal.  Man...they sure know how to cook those bad boys.  They were so good, I returned the next day for a second helping!  I will go back again, but try a different seasoning the next time.   And buy-the-way....I really wish they would remove the heads of shrimp before they serve them however.",

Service: The servers were super friendly right out the gate. They were very accommodating and sweet enough to teach us all about the craziness we were about to experience that was hot and juicy! They constantly check on our table and always made sure we had enough to drink.  Food: after we learned a little bit about how the menu work, we decided to try a pound of the shrimp since they were out of blue crab and also the Cajun fries and Creole calamari. Everything was extremely delicious and the space was on point for the spicy shrimp. My only hope, and being the fitness girl, was that there was some kind of salad or greens option which was the only thing missing from the menu-I have to remember that not everything can be healthy  Experience: we have eaten crab legs before in the comfort of our own home but it was really fun to experience hot and juicy with the plastic bib and the plastic gloves and the nonuse of utensils-it was like being a big kid out in public! Everything was awesome and we definitely want to come back when they have more seafood in stock so that we can try out the entire menu.",

But, they don't  have any silverware. Except the very cheapest plastic ever. Couldn't eat corn. Way too mushy. Guess if you're drunk enough, and the spice it up enough, (which mine was after asking for no spice), doesn't matter what they serve. Very bad experience for me.

As of lately, they've only been giving one cluster. I was too embarrassed to ask the waitress if this is the correct order but I drummed up the courage and waitress said with confidence that my order was correct. So I went to a grocery store the next day and asked the seafood department to weigh a lb of snow crab legs for me and it was indeed two clusters! I feel cheated!!! Shame on you Hot N Juicy Crawfish for cheating your guests!!!!",

The nice waitress did warn us that the crawfish were frozen since they weren't in season but I'm thinking the shrimp may have been as well since a lot of pieces were mushy inside the bag. The sauce was great that came in the bag but the random mushy pieces of crawfish and shrimp threw us off. I think we'll hunt for a place that does a crab boil with the sauce on the side since businesses that drench their seafood in tons of sauce can hide inferior quality much easier. Something at this restaurant definitely changed and the quality has gone down..maybe they're trying to cut corners to save money.   My boyfriend and I were both sick 20 min after eating here so it could have been the seafood hence all the mushy pieces in our bag.   Nevertheless we won't be back. :(",

We placed our order with Sara shortly after. My order came out first at 6:30pm and I wanted to wait for my fiance's order to come out so we can eat together. 7:00pm came along and my foods getting cold. We didn't see our waiter around so we followed up on her order with a different lady. She went to go check on the status and did not get back to us. 7:15pm other people that came after us were receiving their orders. And it continued until we asked for our check to pay for only what was served. They thought it was a kind gesture on their part to leave with free food..it only added insult to injury. Definitely or last time going there.",

We were easily accommodated for a group of 8. Chicken wings were greasy, but Cajun fries were good.

The shrimps are fresh and huge. The sauce suites the the shrimp meat very well. I also love their seasoned fries.   The parking and customer service is also very good.",

My friend and I came in around 7:30 and this was the first time there was absolutely no line or queue for a table. In fact there were only 2 other tables at the time.   The place was cold so it was obvious they were cheap on turning up the heat to a reasonable temperature. My friend and I ordered 1 pound of shrimp each, that's it. Considering that were only 2 other tables, I wasn't expecting to wait over 10 minutes but we did. Surprisingly, the shrimp came out cold for some reason and the amount of sauce was lacking that 1/4 of the shrimp wasn't even touched by the sauce. This tells me this restaurant is cheap and cutting back on the amount of butter they use. I wouldn't be surprised if this shrimp was sitting around and wasn't cooked to order.   Cheap on heating, cheap on butter and cheap on fresh shrimp. Will never come to this location ever again!!!!  Now I knew why there was no line and the place was really empty.",

The main thing that makes crawfish worth eating is the crawfish itself; hot n juicy is known for having the freshest crawfish being that we are away from the shore. Why is it important to be fresh? Because the meat is extra tender! Even when crawfish is out of season, they serve crawfish that is fresh frozen and it taste pretty decent. The next important thing about good crawfish is the sauce!!!!!! Hot N' Juicy is known for their over usage of garlic, but that's what makes it so tasty! Just make sure you don't wear anything or bring anything unless you want it to smell like garlic because the smell with stay on you for days!",

Only can comment on the take-away part of the business, as I have never eaten in the restaurant itself, but the only difference is the seats, they serve you in a bag no matter what. The servers are attentive and friendly, even if you are just chilling and waiting to pick up your order.  Market price on the seafood, seems in line with everywhere else, ~$11.99 for shrimp, ~$9.99 for clams.   The best sauce is the 'Hot N Juicy' style, and they aren't kidding about the spicy level- so be warned!     Full on the weekends, and for good reason, you need more shrimp!!!!",

    "text": "Similar style to Boiling Crab in California, and to compare the two, I would say this place tops them! First of all, we came at roughly mid-afternoon (3:30 pm) and there was no wait at all; Unlike if I was to go to Boiling Crab I would be waiting a little bit around this same time because of how popular they are (and to be fair, it has been awhile since I last visited them). Now onto the food! The flavor was deep and rich! I couldn't stop digging in, and before I knew it finished 1/2 lb of shrimp in a matter of minutes. The best part was peeling the shrimp on top of my rice to let the sauces fall and soak in the rice. Their king snow crab was absolutely delicious as well. Cracking, breaking, and digging for the meat never felt so easy and tastes so good! In addition to the food, our primary server Alison (I believe that's how her name was spelled), delivered such wonderful customer service the entire ambiance felt as if one was eating at relative's during the holidays. She was sweet, kinda, and very genuine to talk to. Her along with her fellow co-workers were on top of their customer service for not just my table, but other tables as well. I saw refilling drinks in a timely manner, joking with the customers, and making the environment very welcoming. Overall, I am very impressed and happy with my first visit here, and I would definitely come back to visit whenever I'm in Vegas again!",

So... as you walk in, you notice that all the tables are covered with white plastic and everyone is wearing bibs and most are wearing gloves.  Right off the bat, you know this is going to be an culinary adventure in some messy eating.  And oh man is it.  The menu is pretty simple... mostly shellfish... so if you are allergic I suggest you stay FAR away from this place.  They don't have salads on the menu... or really any type of veggie other than corn and potatoes... nothing green anyways.  So, don't go expecting to get a side salad with your shrimp.  You can get rice, french fries, sweet potato fries, hush puppy-like dish and bread to help soak up all the yummy sauce.  We got 1 lb each of shrimp and king crab legs with the Hot and Juicy sauce, Mild.  Their Mild is like most other places Medium.  It's got a nice kick to it and after eating a couple pounds of shellfish... your mouth is \"warm\".  (Good thing that Nielsens Frozen Custard is in the same shopping center.)  So you eat the shellfish with your hands... Peel and Eat right from the bag. They serve it to you in big plastic bags.... no platters... no plates.   They do have plastic spoons for the rice tho.  The sauce is Great!  And I want to go back and try the Lemon Pepper which I hear is really great too!  The shrimp and crab legs were meaty and had good texture... but it's all about the sauce and the experience.  We had fun playing with our dinner... and because you eat slower... you get full faster.  So, I think that's a good thing, right?  :)  Service was super friendly.   This would be fun with a group of people.",

Five stars because she engaged with my son. He hardly gets treated like he's there and I loved that she had a little conversation with him when we got to our table. We're not the type to use gloves when peeling our shrimp and dug in with our bare hands...all eyes on us and heads turning but we didn't care because that's Filipino roots for ya! :P",

As we sat down to eat we were given and plastic gloves and sat at a table covered with a white plastic wrap.  We ordered a pound of shrimp and ordered it with baby spicy,  which was still pretty spicy for us. Our order came to us in a plastic bag tied at the top the shrimp all the seasoning the corn and seasoned red potatoes were in the bag. There is no silverware and no plates you just open up your plastic bag and eat on the table. Pretty neat atmosphere and experience. Our server, Janjira, was fantastic she explain everything to us and even gave us sample crawfish to try first time. The food was fantastic if you don't mind getting messy.

However, it is done well, the food is fresh and they have a good selection. Remember that some seafood is seasonal so they may not have everything on the menu year round. My only complaint is that if you order an appetizer it usually comes out at the end of the meal, we've been twice and this happened both times. Not sure why, as they refill drinks quickly and overall service is good, I think the fried foods take a back seat to the steamed foods. Modest beer selection, but they have sweet tea so that wins them an extra star rating.",

We weren't greeted right away when we walked in, but it wasn't a big deal, plus the restaurant was packed and we barely had to wait because of our timing.  You aren't assigned a specific waiter/waitress.  Someone seats you/takes your order and basically if you need anything or want to order more, you flag down whoever is walking by.  This is both positive and negative; you never need anything until you realize no one is around, haha.  They have bibs and gloves available, but we didn't need the bibs, really.  I started my meal with gloves on, but they made it hard to peel the shrimp.  We ordered one pound of shrimp with medium hot-n-juicy and one pound with medium lemon pepper. We also ordered one order of Cajun fries.  Everything really is hot and juicy!  All of the prices for their seafood are based on the market price, so if you check out their menu online looking for prices, you won't find anything.  The cheapest seafood item was $10.99 (crawfish) and our shrimp cost $11.99/lb.    It was delicious and we will certainly return!  ***Beware if you have a sensitive stomach like me, you will be on the toilet shortly after. Take care to order spices according to what your body can handle!***",

My wife did order a po'boy shrimp sandwich which wasn't that good. And my mom did order the battered butterflied shrimp. I found that to be overbattered. The sweet potato fries that came with it were quite good. We got some rice and we poured some of the shrimp sauce on it and it was sooo good. We wimped out and ordered baby spice on the shrimp. So delicious. We loved the concept of just eating with our hands. The flavor of the garlic butter came through very well. Suck the shrimp heads and then peel the body. Soooo good. We also ordered a pound of the crawfish which wasn't our fave. We preferred the shrimp for sure. We'll be back.",

Of course when someone asks me \"have you eaten here before?\" my answer is \"no, this is my first time.\"   He gave a complete, simple and friendly explanation of how to order, engaged with our group asking what we liked, our level of spice tolerance and his recommendations. We actually added some additional items, we would not normally order off of his recommendation.  Lazar continually maintained our drinks while we were waiting on our food. We were thirsty and we never had a chance to ask for refills he was there.  Food was delivered timely and in the correct sequence.  From that point they maintained an excellent wait time check on our needs and kept our beverages full.   I stopped and asked one of the female wait staff what the name of our server was? She replied honestly \"we are are all your servers here sir, is there anything I can assist you with.\"   First thought: Damn the wait staff here got game.   Food:  4stars Ordered  2 lb crab ordered different flavors and spice levels.  1.5. Shrimp, diff flavor and spice levels. Full oysters on a half shell. Oysters were clean tasting but were disappointingly small. Corn tots, didn't care for them but other members of my party raved about it.  The service put this visit over the top at 5 stars. I will come back here again. Sorry BC.",

We ordered one regular and one spicy.  I loved the spicy!  Great flavor.  The meal comes with crab, shrimp, crawfish, potatoes, corn, sausage and a calamari appetizer.  We thought it was great food and fun to dump it all on the table.  We will be back!",

I ordered pound of shrimp and a corn on the cob with a side of red potato. Well my potato came first with the corn was really cold temperature, I sent it back and asked for a new one. Well my sons fries never came and I had to keep on asking for them. My potato finally came with my corn when I was done peeling and eating my shrimp. My napkins were out had to ask to get them replaced. Also my drink was never refilled till the end. Never got an apology for their lack in service. Never will come to this location. Your employees need training.   The manager contacted me and offered me a free brownie dessert!!!!!! Really!!!!!!! WOW!!! That's not going to solve all the issues I had with the restaurant!!",

    "text": "The best tasting mess you could possibly get down with! I love it so much that i just keep ordering the same thing every time. They sell the seafood items by the pound (anywhere from $10-$15 lb) unless they're offering higher end fish such as lobster or dungeness crab which are usually a higher market price. They come in a large bag with the seasoning of your choice, the spice level of your choice as well as the option to add corn or red potatoes to be boiled in there. They also offer fried fish baskets such as catfish or shrimp, fries, poboy sandwhices and estouffe.   My go-to:  1lb Shrimp w/ Hot & Juicy Seasoning in Medium Spice Level  Fried Catfish Basket w/ Fries *TIP: Dip your catfish in your bagged sauce! SO GOOD! 1lb Mussels w/ Hot & Juicy Season in Mild Spice Level 1+ Corona Cerveza  *Be sure to ask for extra lemons and Salt/pepper mix for your food when it arrives! **Medium Spice: Not too spicy but enough to get your nose going toward the end ***Mild Spice: Really good if you're all about savory flavor (awesome for dipping fries in)  It's a really casual environment, they offer a bib and gloves. WEAR THE BIB! You basically eat out of the bag, crack and peel shells on the table in piles, use a million paper towels to maintain a decent grip on your beer... basically all right up my alley. The servers are all really nice, they're constantly walking through the tables so if you need anything any of them regardless of your waiter will take care of you.   WEEKEND ALERT: If you're planning to go around dinner time on a friday or saturday prepare for a little wait (15-30 minutes). I recommend making it a later dinner (8pm) or an early dinner (5:30pm). Otherwise they're pretty good about getting you seated promptly. There is also the bar which is about 8 seats at a high top bar that servers super quick.",

When it came time to pay the bill Tiffany the hostess arrived to the table with the bill and asked for identification while using a credit card. Under normal circumstances when this protocol is in effect with all customers then I respect the protocol. This was not the case as I observed several patrols not of color satisfy the bill without producing identification. I would suggest people of color not patronize this Hot N Juicy establishment as the hostess did a poor job apologizing for her disrespectful approach resolving the bill.",

    "text": "Since i love seafood hot n juicy is one favorite restaurants.  But today they really let me down.  1st of all my dinner date didn't really even want to go there but i talked him into it since this was his last night in town.  We arrived there around 9pm and planned on leaving by 10pm (when they closed)  as i had to pick up my daughter from the airport at 1040pm. By 920p my dinner date had his food and was eating (..he ordered a fried basket and i got crab legs)  i patiently waited for my food to come out.  After awhile i noticed a couple who had walked in after us already had their food.  After i asked about 3 servers 30 min later where my food was i was finally told the order wasn't put in for some reason and they had to do a rush order.  Got a vague apology.  So around 955pm I finally have my food.  Mind you my dining buddy is already finished his food and is just watching me eat. I love to savor crab when i eat it but that this point i'm having to scarf it down to make it to the airport on time.  This was not my ideal dinner outing.  My date asked if we can get the bill adjusted so the server takes the bill to the manager and she takes off a whooping $2.16 (Off $38) Its not like we came to hot n juicy to seek out a free meal but we wanted good service and a enjoyable time before he flew out the next day and we didn't feel like we got that.  Then my date went to the manager to try and get more taken off after explaining the circumstances she then takes off another $3 for a total of $5. Again,  no real apology or anything.  Very disappointed. Hot n juicy is always crowded,  they act like comping my $21 meal for their bad customer service was going to put them out of business or something.... smh. Im big on principles and i feel like they dropped the ball tonight.  Won't go back anytime soon.",

If I'm ever craving shrimp or crawfish, I'd definitely come here instead of Boiling Crab or the other Chinatown location.  My go-to order: Cajun fries (kinda spicy), 1 lb. Medium Hot N Juicy Shrimp and a side of rice. I think it was about $12.99 per lb for shrimp. This definitely filled me up! Unfortunately, I still prefer Boiling Crab's Whole-Shabang, but for the location proximity and little to no wait, this place is definitely the next best alternative.  Delicious. Messy. Smelly. Garlic-y. Yup. This place has it all! Service was attentive throughout our visit and they were super friendly. My partner ordered crawfish too, which was tasty. They had a frozen crawfish or fresh option, which was interesting to see. When we went, I think it was about $7.99/lb for frozen and around $12.99/lb for live crawfish.  In total, we spent about $58 bucks including tip and tax for a party of 2. This was definitely expensive for a seafood craving, especially since we didn't even order crab or alcohol. No regrets.

I'm sickened to think that I had already eaten half of the bag before I found it or what I might of eaten before since I've gone here a few times! I've even brought my boyfriend and mother praising how good it was and now I feel guilty of what they might have eaten too.   This place cost too much to find bugs in your food!! CHECK YOUR FOOD CLOSELY!! THIS IS NOT ACCEPTABLE!!",

I always get rice just because rice helps me get full, or else I could eat 10 lbs of seafood to myself with no problem, and w/o hesitation, I get calamari for babe and Clams forsure for me.   Firstly, you get started with a bibs, gloves, salt, pepper, and lemons. Squeeze the lemon in you salt and pepper for dipping your seafood. Put the gloves to the side, because not getting messy is no fun. Put your bib on (SERIOUSLY, PUT YOUR BIB ON IF YOU LIKE YOUR SHIRT), and prepare to devour.  The clams are juicy, plump, and large. The mussels are well-cleaned. The shrimp are large and generally not overcooked. You get to pick the size of D. Crab. Go big or go home! Corn is a 1/4 cob, sausage is sliced... overall you cant go wrong with what you get because it's the sauce that makes everything great!",

Not too spicy just enough to still be able to taste the flavor of your meal. Also got a basket of Cajun fries so I can dip them in the juice bag of flavor that the crab comes in. It's so good.

    "text": "I am not sure why I haven't wrote a review for this place, we have been coming here since it first opened. Hot n juicy and boiling crab has always been my favorite places to grab me a nice juicy pair of crab legs, or a whole crab or a bag of shrimp with rice and corn. With Last nights experience I will probably not be coming back for awhile. Let me tell you one thing I won't be missing! I won't miss spending an arm and a leg on the amount they charge for their seafood.  I have been eating crabs all my life and never discriminated on any of the crab clan including the blue crab (female ones are my fav)  So on with my experience: yesterday I decided on ordering the whole dungeon crab (per sons request) and as I was breaking that sucker open I saw some unfamiliar clear slime all inside the shell. I thought hmmmmm, must be some kind of fat. I was so caught in the motion of breaking my crab up for my son.  When I finally snapped the legs apart I saw the same thing on the inside of the body!  I was immediately alarmed! I've never seen this shit before in my life!  I told my husband WTF is this?  I sampled a piece and was so grossed out (mind you I don't like sushi) and Good Lord! I realized it was not cooked! The waiter happen to come in the nick of time and I showed him my broken up pieces, what the heck is this? I have never seen anything like this in my life! He was a little struck with shock, he then replied oh wow! That's not fully cooked!  So he basically confirmed it was raw! I was so grossed out!  But since my son wanted crabs so bad, I agreed to having another one fully cooked!   Can I just say this experience was probably one of the most difficult task in my life! Believe me I had plenty! But to Consume another Crab after that experience was unbelievably hard! I literally was forcing my self to eat my expensive crab.  Looks like I won't be eating Crabs or seafood for a very long time!  This morning I woke up with the reminder in my mouth and stomach!  Last night was ruff, I kept obsessing over my experience, and my thoughts took over, that I had to partake in google and researched my possible illnesses that could of occurred. As I read more into my research I have a possibility of symptoms occurring within 6months! WTF? Google was no help as I sat on my porcelain throne, pushing the night away. Overall: I was a little disappointed the way they handled my situation. The manager never came to my table and apologized or asked if their was anything they could do! The waiter apologized but also reminded me that it will take awhile to cook another one (which probably had more to do with them closing soon)  So overall, I hope I won't get sick with their neglect to properly cook seafood and I probably won't come back here for awhile. Which I am pretty bummed!  I love the sauces! The sides and shrimp! But after this experience, I won't be coming back for a very long time! I don't my stomach could handle it!",

    "text": "I love me some Hot N' Juicy! This particular location is located in the corner of a busy strip mall on Eastern right before Silverado Ranch Blvd. I almost missed it because the sign was out and it was dark. They were not too busy when we arrived, and were seated promptly. The staff were friendly throughout our time here.  So this is a seafood place but with a twist. They have your standard fried seafood items like clams and shrimp, also po-boys and fries. But I come for the seafood by the pound and it's unlike any other place I have been. How it works is you pick your seafood and you can choose from: shrimp, clams, crawfish, various types of crab, lobster and mussels. Everything is market price so it can change daily. Then you pick your sauce which the seafood is tossed in. I always get the Hot N Juicy which is all of the sauces mixed together, but they have lemon pepper and cajun to name a few. Lastly you choose your heat from baby spice all the way to SPICY. Everything is then tossed together in a plastic bag which then is served to you hot at the table. You eat with your hands which can get messy so they provide bibs and gloves.   Although crab is my fav. it's pricey, so this visit I got the shrimp and it was $14.99/lb. I only got half a pound and added sausage and potato to my bag and a side of white rice, with the hnj seasoning, mild. This was the first time I've tried mild and it was a bit too spicy for me. I will probably stick with baby spice from here on out. The sauce is extremely delicious though, chock full of garlic and lemon and butter with cajun spices. This is why I get the rice so I can sop up all that deliciousness. The shrimp come whole which is a minor annoyance having to peel them. Even with gloves, be prepared to smell like a vampires worst nightmare for a couple days. I had garlic coming out of my pores. I really enjoy this place and will come back soon.",

After reading some reviews about the place, I warned them all not to wear their fancy church clothes. And I'm glad I didn't let them because it is MESSY!   The food itself was ok. I read other reviews about too much salt, I have to disagree, not enough in my opinion. The food was a little bland and also kinda pricey for the amount of food you get. We were  all still hungry after almost spending over $200.  Another reason I knocked some stars off is because of the service. We didn't get just one waitress, we got 3 different ones. So we kept having to repeat ourselves. We clearly told them we were all gonna share everything, yet they forgot to bring everyone the utensils for the crab legs. Only half of us got them. There were 8 drinks, but we only got 6 straws, etc. it just wasn't good service. We still left a big tip because they did have to clean our mess afterwards.",

    "text": "I eat crawfish all the time back home, and all my friends had said hot n juicy is really good, comparable to boiling crab, so we gave it a try today.. And it was eh. Very disappointing. The hot n juicy sauce was alright. It was a mixture of garlic butter, lemon pepper and what not. Make sure to shake up the bag for all the garlic at the bottom! Either way, the sauce was okay not that flavorful unless you pick up a crawfish with all the garlic on it. I had to order a extra side of spicier sauce.. We ordered 5lb and the crawfish was all small. Every 2lb comes with free corn and potato which was cool, but neither had any flavor either. I don't know. Maybe it was an off day, or it's just this location. Cause my friend who was also dining with me did not even touch her 2lb, she said Chinatown is much better? Idk but never again. Was not worth our 100$. We could've ate a buffet instead.",

    "text": "I love hot n juicy so much. I've yet to cheat with the competitors.  My order is medium spiced lemon pepper shrimp with sausage. I also like their corn fritters & Cajun fries. White rice of course:] I just wanted to say this location definitely trumps the other two in the city.  I came with my coworkers after work and was HUNGRY!   90 % of the time there is a wait in the china town locations so I was so happy to be immediately seated.  The service was awesome. Everyone who came into our paths or by our tables helped us or asked us if we needed anything.  The other locations are usually super busy and service sucks and always forgets refills. It's high spice and sodium food we need refills!  If you've never been you order seafood by the pound in different spice levels and different sauces. You can add corn, sausage, and potatoes to be cooked in the sauce also. They also carry different fried food baskets like catfish and chicken nuggets.  The food comes in bags and you eat right out of the bag and leave the trash or mess on the table. There is also wine and beer at this location as I believe there is a bar you can sit at.  This isn't for everyone but I love it. Sure it sucks you and your car might smell garlicky but to ding them is silly.   I don't have much more to say. I had a stellar time here the other night. Sometimes the other location almost over boils the shrimp as the meat gets stuck to the shell but not here.   The main reason I enjoyed myself so much was the staff. We couldn't stop talking about how nice, helpful, and efficient every one was.   If I had one thing to nit pick about it was sort of lame my fries came out awhile after the shrimp but it was still the best time I've had at any location.   I'll definitely return.",

We started going to the Henderson location because it was larger and didn't feel as congested as the other two locations, even though it is much farther.   The food like always is delicious!!!! Definite 5 stars. There were 10 of us and most of us got shrimp, different sauces and spice but were all very satisfied. We tried the new Cajun calamari, definite must try. It is just the right amount of spice. Oysters tasted fresh!   Unfortunately, the deduction of stars was for service. We waited for about 35 minutes for our food which wasn't too bad since they had told us they were a bit behind but one of the people with us didn't get thier order and after asking twice where it was (& everyone just saying I'll check)...another 20 min went by and his food finally came but was wrong! Additionally, we asked for another rice but they said it would be 30 min for rice (we said never mind). The server was apologetic but honestly she didn't even seem to know what was going on with our order.   It was a busy night so maybe that played a part, but overall the food is definitely worth coming back for!",

The server did look at us a little weird when we kept ordering because there were only two of us ordering this much food but we were troopers & finished it.   Everything was delicious and our server was super awsome and on point and he always kept checking up on us to make sure everything is good. Our crab came out a little undercooked & we asked them to cook it up a little more but they made us a whole new one! Talk about service!

If I rated this just on food I'd give it 4 stars. I ordered a pond of shrimp, crawfish and blue crab with cajun spice at the spicey level. Spicy wasn't too hot, I could have gone to the top level. The shrimp and crawfish were excellent, fresh, a good amount. Crab wasn't the best deal, just two in a pound but I figured that.  What could have been better... ambiance is just OK. Maybe a few more booths and a little more space between tables. Needed some baskets for discards so we didn't have to dig through our old stuff in the bags. Service was a bit slow but it was a busy Mother's day Sunday.  I'll go back again just for the shrimp and crawfish and try the extra spicy.",

We got Cajun fries for appetizers and they're probably the spiciest fries I've ever fasted. They were really good nevertheless. We also got 12 pieces of oysters. The oysters were really delicious because they were still juicy and still has the consistency of fresh oysters. They were also big oysters. The platter came with lemon and Tabasco Hot Sauce. For my main entrees, I got 1 lb of crawfish and shrimp. Both with the Hot N Juicy flavoring and mild level of spiciness. The shrimp were big and easy to peel and so were the crawfish. Beware though that \"mild\" is pretty spicy and should have enough kick to get your sinuses to open up. I would definitely come back to this location again because of their awesome customer service and great food. I highly recommend this place over other similar restaurants. Just remember to wash your hands really good or you will smell like crawfish all day!",

I would have to give this place 5 stars because of the wonderful customer service I received ordering my food over the phone (also my parents come to this location all the time and the food is always delicious) wish I had her name but definitely 5 starts.  She recommended if the medium flavor since the spicy is extra hot today",

I ordered 1 pound of clams and while I ate them it felt like I was crunching on rocks. Probably only ate 6 and left the rest for the trash. I ordered the crab shell pho sandwich and can I tell you, it felt dry(very little sauce and lettuce). Did I mention that I only got 3 pieces of crab shell and the rest was balls of deep fried dough. It was a waste of money.",

The sauce is extremely flavorful and loaded with chopped garlic. The shrimp and crawfish are of nice size and fresh. They sell bowls of their incredible sauce mixture, which I loved taking home and incorporating into rice dishes.",

To start off typically you are supposed to receive the drinks before you receive the food. Nope got out the fries which I ordered CAJUN and did not have seasoning. The waitress insisted they were seasoned well I guess my memory is shot because I order the Cajun fries all the time. I ordered a pound of shrimp which was not hit when I got it. Whatever I tried to eat it anyways and the most of them were mushy. Which means they were not made fresh. I sent them back after eating 3 and received a 20% off. Again the server insisted that it was just that \"typically they get like that\" I eat at hot n juicy (off of sprint mountain) multiple times a month and have never had that problem. I will take the trip to spring mountain next time. The service here is awful.",

    "text": "This place is an unmitigated disaster. We waited at the door for ten minutes despite four booths being open. Then we got seated by a hurried waitress proclaiming that \"we only have a table, will that be ok?\"  Curious since there are booths on either side of us...but ok.  The waiter started off great and took our order quickly. It was all downhill from there.  The other couple in our group does not like overly spicy food so ordered theirs \"mild\".  What came out of the kitchen was so hot it made me tear up, and I adore spicy food. I was lucky to even get that since it seemed that our server had forgotten to ring in my order.  I sat while everyone else at the table ate their dinners. We made many attempts to get our server's attention and finally did so after about 15 minutes.  We had to remind him twice to refill our drinks and had to argue about our order to prove to him that I was indeed missing my food.    Fifteen more minutes passed and still no sign of my crab legs, so we asked to speak to a manager.  To which we were told that the manager was fixing the soda machine.  So he sent a \"lead\" to our table.  She told us that there had been a mix up and that they would START making my crab legs now.  So the server had done nothing in the last 30 minutes to rectify this issue. By now, I was furious.  I didn't even want to eat the food that finally showed up.    I went to the seafood market the next night and bought clams, lobster, shrimp and crabs.  We had an old fashion seafood boil in our own house for less than HnJ and it was all delivered on time.  Save your money and get creative.  We had so much more fun making the seafood in the comfort of our own home!!",

I decided to come here ordered the half pound of shrimp which is not very much hot and juicy style baby spice which made my nose run because it was so spicy. I got three potatoes in my meal, the flavor was good tons of garlic so beware bad date spot! Ordered a side of calamari for the table. It was around $12 and it came out in a tiny basket with one thing of sauce with about 12 pieces so $1 a piece and it was horrible! After we left everyone was still kind of hungry as it wasn't a lot of food but it's not cheap either. I honestly can think of a ton more places I would rather eat! I guess for the \" experience\"  it's good but to me not something I'll be adding to the top of my list by any means.",
