    "text": "I really, truly, honestly wanted to give this place five stars.  The vast selection of beer is mind-boggling.  Beer after beer after beer...beers you have never heard of, eagerly waiting to be sampled.  I came in with my family for a late lunch (3:00 on a Saturday) so there was no wait.  The service was great.  I have two complaints, though.  First, the beer sampler is mediocre at best.  It was your typical six 5-oz glasses, but the choices were already set.  Whoever picked the beers for the sampler must have been feeling very uninspired, because they had two Gordon Biersch beers.  Gordon Biersch is a good beer, but I feel that with the huge selection available, it is definitely on the JV squad of beers.  If you go to Yard House looking to try something new and exotic, not just the microbrews they sell at your local grocery store, you would be better off convincing your dining partners to purchase a few different pints rather than relying on the sampler. Second, the portabello burger was unimpressive.  The bun turned mushy and fell apart when I tried to eat it by hand.  Maybe it was meant to be eaten with a fork and knife and I am some uncultivated country rube unacclimated to the proper use of dining utensils.  But I think the primary purpose of going to the Yard House is to drink beer; having food available (even lackluster portabello burgers) is a consolation prize.",

Their entire menu is made up of comfort food, so if you are down to eat pot pie and all the staples that grandma used to make, you have come to the right place.  They have a huge beer list, but unfortunately there are no descriptions of the beers, just names.  However, their staff is always happy to make suggestions by asking what you like.  Their awesome food and friendly staff plus the location is enough for me to give this place the elusive 5 star rating.",

Lots of crab meat and crab flavor, nice chunks of lobster, can't really taste the lobster because the crab was over powering . Maybe they should omit lobster and give a bigger portion or charge less. I'm guessing maybe 5oz portion of dip, comes w flat bread and chips. Onion rings served red robin style on a metal peg. I like these better then RR looked like made in house w/ a beer batter, and dusted w/ parm cheese. If this is the batter they use for there fish and chips , nice. I had the crab cake hoagie bread was toasted nicely , it came with two crab cakes about 2 -3oz ea. Bacon,tom  lett and onion. I could only eat half I didn't care for the Cajun aioli it came with, but that's not YH fault my own personal taste, next time I know to get tartar sauce. Fries was shoe string very good. Wife had the mac and cheese , with  chix , mushroom and bacon , I had a little taste . No big deal she liked it,i'm sure she'll write her review. Menu reminds me of claim jumper , something for everyone's taste . I would eat here again .",

This is a great place to get lunch if you have some extra time during your lunch break or if its your day off.  Pretty mellow atmosphere during the day, gets pretty busy during the evenings.    Before our friend arrived we told the waitress that it was her birthday and asked if at some point towards the end of the meal we could get some kind of little birthday dessert brought out. She delivered on that towards the end of the meal, no charge.    She was a great waitress in every other aspect of our meal as well.  Made it such a great experience.  The food was pretty good as well, especially the lettuce wraps. There were no complaints from anyone at the table about the food, there was praise all around.  Best part was it was a pretty cheap meal for 3 people, at least cheaper than i expected it to be and that's always a pleasant surprise.   This is definitely my favorite Yardhouse out of all the ones in the Las Vegas area.  Will have to go here again when we get the chance to visit Vegas again since we now live in Utah.",

It was much appreciated and seeing their smiles made my midday. It wasn't the fake costumer service smile you see at other American bars, it was the I'm proud of where I work smile. Which is rare in this day and age where costumer service isn't as exceptional as Yard Bird. Sharon and Kristian (misspelled Kristian's) made sure my experience there was amazing!   I got the Korean short rib street taco meal and my boyfriend got a bacon burger meal. Whatever all of the chefs were doing, keep on doing it! The contrasting flavors with the taco, spicy rice and refried beans made the meal a perfection of fusion flavors. Lol, I got some of his French fries before he ate them all yet fried just right. Perfectly crisp on the outside and fluffy on the inside along with the right amount of salt made the fries addicting. I will be back, this time towards the end of the day. Trying the chocolate sout root beer float is next! You guys from management to crew amd chefs are greatly appreciated.",

There is a patio entrance but not really clear.   We elected to sit at the bar to enjoy happy hour beverage specials. We were helped by Lauren and Taylor. Order of how we were helped remain fuzzy.  They were both friendly, attentive, and made sure we were well hydrated. Our bill was also settled fairly promptly.   Some drinks offered and ordered that day included Old 43 and  Timmerman strawberry lambert. Old 43 a mixed drink with bourbon and citrus.  Timmerman strawberry lambert was on tap. One of the two was a bit more on the bourbon and the other was bit more sweet. Both good. The strawberry drink was good. Like a different type of cider malt beverage.  Overall good experience with staff and beverages times.",

My DogFishHead 90 minute IPA washed them down perfectly . I had the short ribs for my main course which was very good. My wife and I usually share entrees and tonight was no different. I didn't enjoy the Lobster Garlic noodles. The lobster was a bit bland and the sauce didn't compliment the lobster well. Some spice and perhaps a stronger Samball or Sichuan kick would have been nice.   The patio was very comfortable and we got to watch the NFL draft too which was nice. We always come here when catching a movie. Parking is never too tough here too which is nice.",

For our main course we ordered the fried gnocchi. I'm certain it's a good dish, it was probably just something neither of us liked.  We decided that we weren't going to take it home but had no problem paying for it. When Cebal brought our check he told us that he would take the gnocchi off our check. Wasn't expecting that. We will be back as we have had some great food. Great beer and great service.",

    "text": "This place is always crowded when I go. Even after happy hour has ended during the middle of the week!  So if you are planning a get together, call ahead and make a reservation. Even then, there might still be some additional wait time for the tables to be cleaned up and reset for your party.  The biggest draw for hitting up Yard House is probably their beer selection.  Because the food is just alright overall with highlights here and there that I have discovered. For arranging parties when you don't know where else to go, Yard House is a safe bet.  Everyone in Vegas that goes out even occasionally will know about it.  Love watching sports and paling around with friends or near by strangers?  This is a good spot, if you are willing to wait for an open table or vacant chair at the bar.  There are plenty of flat screens to occupy your attention.  Looking for a quiet intimate and relaxing place to chill and grab a bite?  The noise alone will get this place crossed off the list.  But you are also not going to be spending the kind of money you would expect to pay at a restaurant with nice tablecloth and illuminated by real candle lights.  The service is okay to way above average.  What I do love about coming here with a large party is that the waitstaff has been trained to keep track of who ordered what, so splitting the bill at the end of the night is as painless and effortless on the customer's part as it is going to get.  Uber kudos for that alone!  I would almost give this place a 4 stars, but for that to happen the food has to be better.",

We asked the bartender about the missing order and she quickly went around the corner to see the food sitting there. I guess no one had notified her that it had arrived. Despite our lunch being overpriced and late it was still decent food.   An hour later after we had departed I started to feel very sick and nauseous. At that time my colleague texted me and said she felt horrible and had been in the bathroom since she returned from lunch. Long story short I had to leave work early and go home because I am feeling absolutely terrible from what I ate.  I have been sick for almost a whole day now. I don't think I will be going back.",

    "text": "Been here twice now. The food was good the first time -- it's expensive for what it is, but what can you expect being in the middle of Town Square.  The first time, things went okay. It was a weekend, but an off-hour, so the place wasn't very busy. Service was fine. Food was pretty good.  The latest time, it was an entirely different story. My sister and I decided to go there and ended up being there at the same time as a wedding reception. Not a big deal; we choose to sit outside under the heater and enjoy the early evening weather. My sister gets a beer, I get a soda, standard stuff. Service is slow, but not terrible.  Then we order.  My sister and I eventually run out of conversation topics. I get a refill after a long wait, she gets another beer. I look down at my phone and it's been basically half an hour since we ordered -- WTF? No information at all.  Eventually our server finally tells us what happened -- My sister's food got picked up by someone and given to the wedding reception guests!! They have had to start her order over entirely. Two refills and another half hour later, they finally bring it out.  My food is luke-warm and uninspiring, while hers is okay. It is nothing to write home about, especially for the price paid. We ask if we are getting any sort of consolation for having to wait over an hour for our food.  The manager decides that the employee discount is fine, which amounts to /less than one of the beers/ off of our ticket (which had two meals, two beers, and one drink). For having to wait nearly an hour for what we ordered. I could understand if there was some complaining, like \"Oh, our order came out on time but there was some trivial thing wrong\", but this was entirely on them, both the delay in telling us what happened and the delay in fixing it.  Not going back again. The slow service, overpriced and under-delivered food, and insanely lame fix for their mess up put me off forever. There are better places to go without wandering through Town Square.",

    "text": "Yard House is the perfect place to have lunch or dinner at after watching a  movie. I've been here twice but my last visit was when I actually tried their food.  Every time I visit it's always crowded, especially on nights when there's a football game on, which was the reason why my friends and I waited for over 15 minutes, but this wasn't a problem.  Yard House has a huge menu that begins with several pages dedicated to beers and other alcoholic beverages. They have a good selection of foods to order. I particularly liked the section where you can sub dishes containing meat with soy.  FOOD  + Baja Fish: Two fried fish tacos topped with shredded cabbage, pico de gallo, guacamole, and sriracha ailoi. This also comes with a side of beans and rice, but I opted for steamed vegetables instead. The tacos were good and have a little spice to them.  I didn't enjoy the flour tortillas. I prefer corn over flour any day when it comes to fish tacos. I also didn't like how small the tacos were, though I learned that you can order more than the two you receive; however, any extras will cost you an additional $5. I'm glad I inquired about this since our waiter didn't mention this when I was asking him questions about ordering additional tacos.   Originally I wanted just the beans and no rice, but our waiter said that counts as one side. I asked if the reason why it's considered as one side is because the beans and rice are mixed together. He said \"no\" and that it's just the restaurant's policy. He also said he could go ask the kitchen if what he said is correct, but he wasn't in a hurry to do that and just stood there waiting for me to make an order after I said it would be cool if he'd ask. (ok then, forget it!). So I chose steamed veggies instead over the stir fry option. I like steamed vegetables, but the veggies I received were watery and disgusting.   + Chicken Nachos: My generous friend offered to share her humongous plate of Chicken Nachos since the two little fish tacos I consumed didn't satiate me. The nachos are topped with chunks of chicken, guacamole, cheese, sour cream, beans, and onions. The nachos tasted better than my tacos, but I disliked how there was fat and skin left on the chunks of chicken. Not cool.  SERVICE No problem with the servers or hostess, but we were displeased with our waiter.  + I understand that the place was packed when we visited, but our waiter didn't come to our table until 10 minutes after we were seated. We ordered our beverages and it took  five minutes for him to return with our drinks.   + When I was finished with my food (plate empty, utensils down, and me sitting there not eating indicates I am finished eating), he came to our table three times, looked at our table, said nothing, then walked away. When he returned for the fourth time he asked me if I was done eating in which I replied with \"yes\", then finally took my plate away.  + He called my friend \"bro\" when SHE asked for another glass of beer. I guess her side ponytail, makeup, and her magenta pants really screams \"bro\".  + As I've previously mentioned, he didn't bother returning to the kitchen to inquire about the question I had about the beans and rice that came with my tacos, and he also tried to get me to buy more tacos without explaining to me that I'll be charged extra. I understand  that it's implied that additional food costs more, but it should also be mentioned because that's just good, honest customer service.   OVERALL  I can see myself making another visit to Yard House, but I'll have to skip on the fish tacos and the mediocre service, which I hope I won't have to experience again.",

Overall decent experience I just wish the service hadn't taken so long",

Beer is expensive, wine is moderately priced, cocktails are absurd  - mu Shu egg rolls taste like cat food  - tuna poke has huge chunks of sometimes tough tuna - summer salad was nice with clementines and strawberries - I do like the selection of videos they play on tv and the music is general good too - service is always decent  - French onion soup is mediocre at best.",

    "text": "On a last minute whim, took a quick trip to Vegas.  Avoiding the overpriced and often horrible service downtown hotel eats, I took a trip South of the city to Town Square Shopping Center.  Here, amongst may outlet stores, I found Yard House.  With the incredible beer selection, this is my kind of place.  Featuring inside and patio dining, I opted for the quicker option of inside inside dining.  Considering I like a more quiet atmosphere, I should have taken the patio dining instead.  Inside was very noisy, and it got worse the more people piled in.  It seems whoever built Yard House went with the industrial look but left out any soundproofing or noise control.  Yard House has over 150 beers to choose from, and I found an old favorite from my time in Germany; Kronenbourg 1664.  The appetizer-size of Guacamole and chips worked well for two but won't feed more.  I chose the Parmesan Crusted Pork Loin.  When it arrived, it was a BIG portion of two chops over sweet potato mash with a healthy side of asparagus.  Now THIS was DAMN GOOD!  The sweet potato \"mashed\" was a great counter to the savory chops.  Breading on the chops was light but covered well.  Over top, chefs drizzled a cherry sauce.  The asparagus was boiled just right, still crisp yet tender.  For an entree just over $20, I felt is was a great deal.  If the inside noise level wasn't so overbearing, I might have stuck around for a second or third beer.  I left with a tab just over $36 and satisfied, as it was a great dinner and more affordable than anything downtown.",

I would highly recommend coming here during happy hour, which is currently between 3pm and 6pm on weekdays and 10pm until close on Sunday through Wednesday. I believe most of their draft beers and many of their appetizers are half price. Otherwise, prepare to spend quite a bit (for my taste anyway).  I've really only been here a few times. Each time, I've been able to find a beer that has been really enjoyable. On my most recent visit last night, I had a Delirium Tremens (a Belgian Strong Ale) and an Alaskan Amber (also an ale). I believe I once had the Delirium Tremens at the Freakin' Frog and it was almost $10. Here it was around $5.  Honestly, I've always liked the idea of Yard House, but it's not a place I go to often. If it's happy hour, I definitely recommend it, especially if you want to try a new beer.",

I have also been offered samples on a few occassions, which I think is awesome!  They have great happy hour specials on both appetizers and drinks.  The outside patio is lovely during the spring and fall, inside tends to get a little loud, so the patio is great for dinner with friends.  The food is delicious.

I had to give someone else my half drunk water. She ask twice if we wanted same glass of water refilled but never refilled it. we were never offered more alcoholic beverages. we felt as if we were being rushed to the  point, ALL condiments were removed and well as glasses from table before we were EVEN done finishing our meals.

Tyler fine came by and handed me a menu, the neglected to return to see if I'm ready to order or sample, finally when Tyler returned  I asked if I can sample the house honey blonde. She grabs a goblet instead of the sample cup so I had to informer her that it was just a sample and that's when the attitude started...  I decided  to get a miller lt and when I received it, it had 2 inch of foam so I waited to show her  to ask if she could top it off and when she came  it was deflated. She informed me that she could not do that cause I could have drank some which I hadn't. I told her I never touched it because of that reason, she rolled her eyes and went to fill it.  I thanked her and was going to giver her a tip but after all that forget it! I am a bartender as well  and hospitality is key with a smile..

I'm a huge fan of the Yardhouse, and even though it's a chain (there are locations all over the west), it has really great food and probably the best on-tap beer selection I've seen in any restaurant.  As for the food, I've tried all kinds of dishes and I've never been disappointed. My favorites are the garlic lobster noodles, the surf and turf burger (a hamburger with asparagus, lobster and a bernaise sauce) and the \"Spicy Tuna Roll\" which may be the best appetizer in this type of restaurant in Las Vegas. It's basically a deconstructed spicy tuna roll that looks like a birthday cake  - with layers of endamame, cucumber, tuna and avocado. It's awesome, and even my kids like snacking on the endamame before the entrees arrive.  The beer selection is immense, and it used to be perfect, but I have to take points off because they recently removed Tetley's (one of my favorite beers). But honestly? Any place that has both obscure Belgian ales AND Pabst Blue Ribbon on draft can't be bad.  As for the kids menu it is what you'd expect, but all the food is just a little better quality than you normally get in a similar restaurant. In fact the mac and cheese is so good (I'm pretty sure there's some truffle oil in there) that your kids might not like it. Though, you'll probably enjoy it the next day for lunch.  I can't vouch for the service in other Yard Houses, but the service in the one in Vegas has always been outstanding. And in the very few instances where we've had a problem, they've taken money off the bill and rectified the situation immediately.  I can't say enough good things about this restaurant, and if you find yourself shopping in Town Square and need a quick place for lunch, it's really the best.",

    "text": "It was my first time to have dinner at the Yard House. After shopping at the Town Square, my friend and I got hungry, so we randomly picked a restaurant. When we get to the entrance of the Yard House, we saw people walk in and out, and some of people were just gathering in front of the entrance. This restaurant was very busy that it took us about half an hour to get a seat. We sat in the restaurant booth, which is about 8ft from the bar. The design of the dinning room is pretty. The room is dark, but very comfortable. I ordered the small size Penne with Chicken, which is in the House Favorite category. My friend ordered the small size BBQ Chicken Salad. Even though the restaurant was very busy, the service was very fast. It took only about 10 minutes for the dishes to be served. In the Penne with Chicken, the penne was nicely mixed with the asparagus, mushrooms, tomato, and cheese, and it also looked glossy. The size of the dish was about 12 to 16oz. The smell of the dishes is very good that it is not too strong but mild. The penne was smooth and a little bit creamy; it was slippery in the mouth. The chicken was tender, and its flavor was salty, a little acid, and creamy. The acid flavor of the tomato was balanced with the marsala cream sauce. The BBQ Chicken salad had a very fresh smell and bright colors. The fried onion had a weaker smell than the no fried one, and it was well mixed with other greens. The texture of the salad was crispy and moist. Because avocado, tomato, beans, corn, cilantro, and pasilla were included in this dish, it had flavor of salty, sweet, acid, and spicy. The chicken of the salad had a little burnt taste. The size of the salad is big that we did not finish it even though the one we order was a small size. Due to the good first impression, my friend and I would like plan for a return.",

    "text": "This is my FAVORITE place in vegas.  Im a visitor from NY and I asked one of my co-workers where their favorite spot in vegas is.  They told me here.  That person did not realize the impact on my life that he made when he said the words \"Yard House\".  This place is located in Town square which is a huge maze.  I have no idea how to navigate around this area, so be prepared for that.  Anyways, we walked in to a lively wonderful atmosphere of people enjoying themselves and just a fun vibe.  We were seated and were amazed by the beer selection.  This place is like an ale house where they must have like 100 beers on tap.  It was awesome.  The first time we came here we sat in a booth with a really nice waitress.  She was quick, interactive, and knowledgable.  I started off with a beer. The first beer I got was 9 dollars and the second beer i got was 6, so I assume that the prices of the beer vary.  We tried the asian thai pizza  - which was amazing.  I think asian thai salads and all of those asian dishes taste the same.  The pizza was amazing and extremely flavorful.  It was like 16 dollars or something.  Then we ordered the Bisque and grilled cheese. It was ok.  Average.  Not the best gr cheese and not the best bisque. 12 bucks or so. (The menu w pricing is easily accessible online)  I ordered the Turkey club which was moist juicy and saucy, which i love.  Bottom line - food is amazing here.    One final thing of note - My girlfriend is a vegetarian and they have a GARDEIN menu.  This has changed my life forever.  It is a soy protein that tastes JUST LIKE CHICKEN.  I now know gardein exists and its amazing.  Thank you Yard House  There are tvs all over the bar and are clear as day.  Great place to watch games and anything.  It was awesome.",

    "text": "I've visited various locations of this chain around the country and I simply never come away disappointed. The one drawback of visiting this location for the first time was actually finding it. The complex/development in which it is located is an absolute monster and it was difficult to drive AND look at all the various store signs at the same time. Once inside, we found a spot at the always large bar and were greeted with the information that Happy Hour was still going and encouraged to take advantage of it. Not only did we do so, but even our second round of drinks were billed to us at the Happy Hour discount despite being ordered at least 15-20 minutes beyond its expiration. The Happy Hour was a tremendous value, especially on the food as both the crab cakes and turkey burger sliders were rather tasty and filling. Not only were our bartenders very nice and attentive, I really appreciated how a store manager was extremely active in keeping a very full bar of customers very happy. Happy Hour or not, I'm a loyal customer of any Yard House and wish there was one in the Tampa Bay area I could visit on a regular basis.",

    "text": "A recent visit to celebrate a friend's birthday, Yard House left me feeling disappointed.  We had a large party, about 14 people at the table.  During our visit, we even had a shift change, where our original waitress was kind enough to let us know she was leaving and who was taking over.    Although the rest of our table had appetizers, The Husband and I arrived in time for entrees:  * New York Steak Salad \"green beans, roasted peppers, avocado, crispy potatoes, red onion and baby lettuce tossed in a gorgonzola vinaigrette with beefsteak tomatoes and pickled egg\" ($16.95) - A generous and flavorful salad, loaded with the ingredients listed and a tasty steak.  * Cuban Roast Pork Dip \"tomatoes, pepper jack cheese, pickles, dijon and garlic aioli on french bread grilled with bbq au jus\" ($12.65) - This was The Husband's order and I had a bite.  It wasn't that great, especially when I recall my previous experience with a Cuban sandwich.  The fries were good though.  My concern was more with service.  The waiter asked the birthday girl what kind of dessert she wanted (out of three choices), and she went for the Chocolate Souffle Cake \"mini serving with vanilla ice cream, served warm\".  When it arrived, there was no candle which surprised us all.  (How are you supposed to sing happy birthday without a candle to blow?)  And he only gave us one spoon, which reminded me that he never brought back dessert menus for the rest of us.  At this point, we didn't bother ordering dessert since the birthday girl already had hers.  That part made the experience disappointing.  The other waiter was able to do a split tender on the check, which was helpful.  (Although he put the costs wrong on my receipt, oh well.)  I usually think Yard House is on top of things, but I guess they weren't that night.",

The only con is that wait times can be long since it's in such a busy area. But that won't stop me from going there and I totally think it's worth the wait.",

    "text": "I must say Yard House is one of my favorite restaurants in Vegas. Whether you are coming for a full dinner or a snack or just a beer, it's amazing!  My favorite snack food here are their Truffle Fries. They fry their shoestring french fries to perfection, tossing them in a combination of truffle and garlic flavors. I get it every time I come here! My favorite appetizer would be their Wisconsin Fried Cheese Curds; they are accompanied by two sauces, one is a creamy, toned-down horseradish sauce and the other is a spicy-honey sauce. They bread the cheese curds lightly enough that it does not drown out the cheese. As for entrees, I enjoy their chicken tenders (which are perfectly crispy on the outside and moist and juicy on the inside), their mac and cheeses (which has the perfect amount of cheesy gooey-ness and is balanced by bacon pieces throughout), and their penne with chicken (that has tender pieces of chicken and is accompanied by crisp pieces of asparagus, giving an extra crunch to the dish).  For their beverages, they have a wide selection of cocktails and beers. I enjoy their more fruity beers, where my go to is the Timmerman Strawberry. Cherry Wheat is also a great choice!  Overall, I really enjoy the atmosphere of all Yard House locations and their food never disappoints. And if you can get their during happy hour, it makes it that much better!",

Cons: Environment isn't unique. Overpriced. Food is average. The lobster Mac and cheese and crab spinach dip both  had shells in them, which was not great.",

Don't get me wrong, the food isn't bad but it doesn't \"wow\" you. It's just average; you would expect something amazing for a meal that's worth almost 2X compared to other places. Now the pros. From when you walk in the place has a nice ambience. It's dimmed lights, open area for walking and enough room between tables for socializing without feeling confined. The staff is kind and always promptly checking on you: filling your water and asking if there's anything else we need. With that said I only go here whenever my friends want to go for a gathering. This being my third time, i guess that means one of two things; either my friends haven't been here before and want to try out this place, or maybe I just haven't been ordering the right foods. Attached are what I ordered this time. I got the poke nachos(~$14) and the spicy jambalaya(~$18).",

    "text": "After picking our friend up from the airport, Ms. G suggested we come here to share some appetizers and dessert. It was a Friday night around 6:45p. We were told it would be a twenty minute wait, but I'm pretty sure it was more like ten. Our waitress Nancy was super friendly, but it seemed like she was stretched pretty thin - I think they're understaffed.   Here's what we tried...  Deviled Eggs - a classic deviled egg covered with a sweet tomato sauce and topped with bacon. SO GOOD!   Egg Rolls - solidly delicious, but probably nothing different/special from anywhere else. Basically, it made me happy because I love egg Rolls.   Chicken Fingers - just like the egg Rolls, pretty much like what you'd find anywhere else. It's well done and can hit the spot. Also, they come with Fries which can be upgraded to truffle Fries.   Truffle Fries - Awesome! You can actually taste the truffle flavor, unlike at so many places. The Fries are skinny cut and pretty drench in the oil. But they have enough Crunch so it didn't bother us.   Short Rib - meh. Great flavor, but too chewy for me. Also, it was accompanied by sauteed spinach that hadn't been seasoned at all and simply tasted of the oil they'd been cooked in   Burger - my friend Mr. P ordered this. While he enjoyed his burger, he made the mistake of getting a side of veggies instead of fries. The veggies seemed to simply be steamed and not seasoned - no good.   Butterscotch Pudding - awesome! Definitely my favorite dessert!   Coconut Ice Cream - much better and more exciting than most coconut ice creams out there. Not only was it full of toasted coconut shavings, but it was bursting with flavor! It almost tasted like a Samoa cookie without the chocolate.   S'more Brownie - fail. Wouldn't get this again. While it was a generous portion, it was wider than it was deep. I was hoping for a deep dish, warm, Gooey Brownie. Instead, it was only a little thicker than a cookie and very dry. No good.   I'd love to go back for happy hour to try more and pay a better price!",

The servers, managers...everyone I interacted with were wonderful. Shout out to Mike, Bo, Seth, Kyle, Dev, and Prescott, for being awesome and actually wanting to be at work that Friday.  Onto the food....I ate Pork Lumpia egg rolls with sweet chili (yummy)and creamy soy white truffle (not so much) sauce. I went something thats hard to mess up and boy was I pleasantly surprised. Flaky fry job outside and moist flavorful inside. Definitely, will be going back again and again.",

I found the salad and I rarely order anything else. Overall, great spot, decent food and drinks.",

The food was okay. It's basically the same type of menu as the Cheesecake Factory mixed with a loud bar. I had the jambalaya and it was tasty but not as spicey as the description made it seem. Not a place for kids (should have read more into this place). And if you do bring your child don't expect people to respect that a child is near with their language (smh). I dunno it would be a cool \"night out with guys\" type of spot. But just not my cup of tea. I liked that I could watch the lakers game but the noise was deafening.",

They have TONS of awesome food starting from $5-$8. $1 off domestic pints & well drinks. $2,$3, & $4 off specialty drinks, martinis and premium spirits. They have two different happy hours from 3pm-6pm & 10pm - close.  I always have to order four of my favorite appetizers; Poki nachos, chicken lettuce wraps, crab cakes, & the margarita pizza!! If you don't want any of those items the options go on and on.  The only down fall or thing you need to be aware of is that this place gets EXTREMELY busy during the happy hour times, so if you're hungry come knowing that you will probably wait at least 15 mins to be seated.  A tip would be just come a bit before the happy hour begins so you can be seated and a little ahead of the crowd.",

She called and wasn't able to make a reservation prior, but we were  still seated within about 45-60 mins which was still pretty quick for peak time.   The service was pretty good. Our waiter was trying very hard to make sure we had everything and constantly checked on us, but the bar was pretty slow with getting our drinks ready.  Food wise I love so many options here. This time my bae and I shared the calamari and the classic ranch salad. The calamari was pretty average, but good. The salad was a bit disappointing dressing wise, if it's called a classic ranch salad you would think I should certainly be able to taste the ranch, but not the case with this one. I recommend trying the grilled cheese or lamb burger here. Those are typically my go to options.   Overall another great yard house location located in a central part of the valley. It's a great spot to grab dinner or a drink after a afternoon shopping spree.",

I always go to happy hour with a group of friends and we all end up sharing everything at the table.   Buffalo chicken wings- Yummy, tasty, and has a little kick! Served with celery sticks and ranch. Chicken lettuce wraps- Healthy and crunchy. They give you about 5 or 6 lettuce cups and three different sauces. So the flavor choice is all up to you! California roll- Don't be fooled by it being just \"one\" California roll, but it's HUGE. It's a jumbo California roll! Calamari- Crispy and cooked perfectly! Squeeze some lemons and dip it in the spicy tomato sauce and it is TO DIE FOR. Spinach dip- Delicious!! Comes with chips. And it's A LOT. Classic sliders- Comes with 4 mini sliders. They give you mustard and ketchup bottles. It comes with a pickle slice and fries. The fries are skinny, crispy, and leave you wanting more! Ahi poke- Though it could be a little bigger of a portion, it's really tasty. Onion tower- They stack a huge tower of onions, fresh to eat!  I've been coming to Yard House forever now and they always have great service and good quality food for their prices.",

Also 8/10 you have OUTSTANDING service. Tho this was not the case the other day. For the most part.   We came in and got sat with Seth. Food was awesome. Except the Thai Chicken Pizza. It was so soggy that when you picked up a slice everything would fall off. Now I would say toppings but no. EVERYTHING. That is where my only issue was until.  So Seth was busy yes. Though the other three tables around me, he stopped and had a full on conversation. My partner and I, were taking our niece out, and wanted to show her a restaurant that is more than your basic Chili's. I got a gift card from a family member, so why not use the opportunity. Teach her real table manners while you eat out. Now I literally sank in my seat with what happened next.  The Pizza was either under cooked, or they put too much sauce all over it. What ever the case, after flagging down Seth, and just asked for the pizza to be taken off. As I didn't want a new on at that point as everything else was eaten.   I asked Seth if he could split the check and CHARGE me for the Onion Rings. My exact statement was. Can you split the check and put the Onion Rings on one check so I can pay with a Debit card, and be able to tip you. You can't tip off a Gift Card.   He literally stoped and looked at me and was like \"Yeah, I mean you better tip me.\"  No. No way. So we still just continued to pay, and I went up to ask for a manager. After waiting and speaking to a manager she did reverse all the charges, and asked to come back again. I did return and had a much better experience at Red Rock. I have a review there too... I recommend staying away from this location, as other reviews state, they have problems with regulars. Though they don't realize they could have a regular also if they wanted to treat everyone like that.",

I ordered the grilled cheese and tomato bisque. It was not my first time ordering it and won't be the last. I like to dip the grilled cheese into the bisque and it's perfection! My husband ordered the cuban sandwich and it comes with a delicious broth you dip your sandwich. Although it is not your traditional cuban sandwich, it was still really good. The service here is always very fast. I've never had to wait long for my food. The prices are reasonable and they have happy hour here Monday through Friday.

My waitress, Genna I believe, was extremely rude. Right when I ordered the kid's meal she was annoyed (probably because the bill would be less).

Which I don't mind, but it's too crispy and greasy. I was fortunate enough to figure this out years ago. I decided to try something new, crab cakes, bad decision!!!! Once again, too crispy! Note to self, don't order fried food!   After I sent back the crab cakes, I went with a favorite, lobster, crab dip. Comes with chips and pita!   They are known for their beer selection on tap. I don't drink beer, but if you order a yard size... Just know it is exactly what it sounds like. A yard!",

The atmosphere is always nice and lively. Our food came and plates were nicely portioned and cooked correctly. My steak sandwich was so good. The brioche bread was soft and the meat cooked medium. The sweet potato fries we're crisp and not greasy. Everyone was satisfied with their orders and we were happy to at yard house. Regulars for sure!",

My usually go-to is their truffle Mac N Cheese. Awesomely gourmet and cheesy. Comes in two sizes (reg and large), go with the regular. Will fill you up just fine.  Good news for vegetarians: an abundance of veggie options here! They even offer a tofu-based meat substitute \"chik'n\" in pastas or sandwiches. One of my fav veggie items are the CHIK'N WINGS - offered in three sauces. Opt for the Jerk sauce! A yummy, tangy, Asian dip!  Heads up that their Asian dishes will be very \"Americanized\". Example - their California Roll is NOT your ordinary sushi roll. It is one giant cake! I have ordered this dish with the rice slightly hard a few times, so I don't take my chance anymore.   One of Vegas' better elections of beer. Everything from wheats, amber, IPA, ciders. Truly something for everyone! My favorite? Watermelon Wheat.  Lastly, no cell connection here!! I dunno if this is a clever way to get people off their phones as they dine. They offer a Yard House guest wifi but it's as good as no connection at all. Couldn't even check into Yelp in here!",

Then finally after a while got our food, 3 of us order burgers and fries (2 of us got fries not really warm but for the 3rd one he didn't even get his fries because they were not ready, so he got his burger without fries, only once we finished his burger the fries finally came). And top of the top, we were still working on our food for some of us and some we had finish, the waiter brought the birthday cake without even paying attention we didn't finish to eat or thinking to clean the table a little !",

I've heard the new beer cocktails are \"weird\" so haven't tried those.  Service is usually good. The servers attitudes are sometimes better than the food runners. I've had plates slung at me...I laughed it off on all accounts, it's a tough job, I get it. They try to keep drinks filled, sometimes they succeed. Better at keeping the alcohol flowing than the water, if you get my drift aka $$.   Some of my family's favorites are chicken fingers (kids menu), their fries, spicy tuna roll & California roll (two of my faves), seared ahi sashimi, Pastrami Sliders & the chicken lettuce wraps. Mac n Cheese is AMAZING, but I usually allow myself to order it once a year- it's so rich. Also, loved the Lobster Garlic Noodle; it's a special occasion dish, too! Any of their salads are good. The Gorgonzola dressing is great. Skip their pizzas.   Check their HH special before you go.  Overall, I am especially fond of the vibe, the layout/lighting & decor, and their great playlist. Service and food are good enough and the drinks are great!",

To date, this is the biggest Yard House I have stepped into so you can tell that during happy hour it can pack quite a big punch for sure..The location itself is massive and tables are everywhere inside and out which made for a very quick wait time as you can imagine!  Foodwise I decided on the black truffle cheeseburger and after some \"local\" inside of my dinner mates the truffle fries..The burger itself was pretty filling and they certainly know how to prepare a medium rare burger when requested to do so (a pet peeve for me)..The patty was juicy and the showstopper to me was that the truffle sauce accompanying the burger and actually the truffle fries was not heavily salted like I am used to here..It turned around my view that maybe there is more to Yard House then just the Yards?  A low point was our waitress who was either just having quite the Vegas night or a Scrooge year round..Initially she threw the coasters down on the table as we ordered drinks and continued to slam down random items at will through out the meal (ketchup, food, etc), but did seem to try the cliche schmoozing when it came time for the delivery of the bill..That was a bit disappointing as it did have all of us blank staring each other if we really just witnessed this, but it did not rule the meal in the end!  The overall atmosphere seemed quite calm, cool, and relaxing..It did have it's share of loud tables, but you must make lemonade when given lemons",

Instead of canceling my order I figured I'd try it since I was at a different location. Wow! I was pleasantly surprised to have the most fantastic New England clam chowder I have had since the East coast. It was the perfect consistency and loaded with flavorful clams. I definitely got my money's worth. The service was excellent, as they bought my glass of wine since there was a minimal delay in my drink order. A delay I barely noticed, but I did make a point of telling them to call the chef in Summerlin and teach him how to make clam chowder.",

    "text": "This is a review of one thing and one thing only: the turkey burger. Walking around Town Square on a Friday evening with a pal seemed like something different to do (at least for me).   Honestly, I don't adore Town Square, and I don't really adore any of the limited culinary experiences I have had at Town Square. I do like the relatively pedestrian-friendly space it provides to roam about and window shop. And, I had remembered reading a glowing review of the turkey burger here, so I wanted to give it a nibble.  Let me be upfront and say that if you care about being healthy, you should probably skip this turkey burger. It was frickin' delicious, but I just knew there had to be some bad things in there to make it taste so good. I checked out the nutrition info on the Yard House website, and this mamma jamma has 2810mg of sodium, plus a lot of other large numbers in unhealthy columns. Wow. I should be swimming laps and doing jumping jacks instead of writing this review. At least I substituted the fries for a salad, right?  Just browsing around their nutrition info, I get the impression that the secret to their tasty eats is salt, salt and more salt. Be warned. The California Roll has 3415mg of sodium. Now, how does that happen? I know fish comes from the salty ocean, but... this crab must be dating someone in the Morton family.  So on pure taste, that burger was definitely in the 4 to 5 star range, but I probably will never eat it again.  Despite being absolutely slammed, the service was great. Our waitress didn't even try to rush us off, which really impressed me.  I think I am seriously going to go swim some laps now.",

    "text": "Ohhh I how I loathe reviewing another chain.  I have eaten here so many times and had an okay experience.  However, yesterday I was there for happy hour with a small group, and we had our share of issues.  First - for whatever reason, the waitress stacked like 7 or more menus on the table, and never picked them up.  As people came to join us outside on the patio, we had to keep moving them on top of the planter divider things that separate the patio from the sidewalk.  We ordered different flavored teas.  The waitress brought separate ice cups and was very slow to refill tea.  She also never brought the limes my friend asked for twice, until we flagged her and reminded her - she had to write it down.  For happy hour, they make the chicken lettuce wraps half off but not the mushroom - weird.  So we opted for chicken...and out they came, with the nastiest lettuce cups I have ever seen - completely brown and pink, looking rotten and absolutely inedible.  Since the waitress disappeared, I had to wait like 15 minutes before showing her and asking for new lettuce.  Quite a while later, she brought a plate with nastier, browner, pinker lettuce.  I told her no way, and she took that away to show her manager.  She took that off the bill and replaced it with another item, and luckily the protocol is to have the manager come out.  The manager apologized for the \"bad lettuce shipment,\" but I explained to her that under no circumstances should anyone in the kitchen allow nasty lettuce to be served, especially not TWICE.  I told her I strongly recommend that they do not serve lettuce to another person that day.  I hope she took my advice.  Kinda turned me off....would rather come back for beer than food now.",

She thought it would be really cool to take me to the Yardhouse because they have so many taps and seem to be a fun place. We were seated fairly quickly and our waitress was very nice. But it took about 15 minutes to even get our drink orders. And then we order appetizers and our meal. That took a while as well and the food was definitely nothing to write home about. The calamari and squid were tough and chewy, and the lobster/crab dip was way to salty! I got the seared ahi sandwich and couldn't even eat half of it, the tuna was dry and overcomes and the dressing was not good. My mom got the baha fish tacos with rice and beans. They were also less than appetizing. Especially for the price! Way overpriced for what you get! I order another beer when our entrees were brought out and it didn't even arrive until we were finished and ready to leave. Yes, this place a great variety of excellent beers, but would definitely not recommend it!",

    "text": "To start off, I will confess...I am already a big Yard House fan. The main reason is it's spin on comfort food and enormous beer selection. That being said...Town Center Yard House gets the fourth star rating because of it's proximity in relation to everything around: shopping, movies, and bars.   Here, Yard House is the perfect addition to a night out at the mall.  - Gone shopping? Get a beer.  - Seen a movie? Get some dinner.  - Headed to the Blue Martini for a Natural Vibrations concert? Drink here first.  The ambiance here is always great: kind of like a dark SUPER SIZED PUB full of beer selections from around the country, hell even the world.   The food is as I said before, comfort food (or it could be the only things I decide to order). My usual order consists of either the Mac and Cheese Squared, Turkey Pot Pie, or Grilled Cheese (with bacon and tomato)/tomato soup. The M&C2 is perfect, what more could one ask of pasta, cheese, bacon, chicken, and truffle oil...brilliance in every spoonful. Turkey Pot Pie is an entire plate of turkey, cream sauce, and veggies covered in a flaky fresh crust. And Lastly, the grilled cheese is the perfect accompaniment of a cold day...or cold beer. Speaking of beer, try the sampler. Daily, the beers of choice switch up so enjoy the variety.   Service is quick with the drinks, courteous, and fun to be around.   Yard House in Town Center exceptional. Beware, place gets crowded pretty quick. Give it a try and see how new age comfort food is made.",

We had a group of approximately 22 and we sang \"Happy Birthday\". That's what I was told was the offensive noise we sang too loud and this is a \"Family Restaurant\". Not for the fact the the Yard House is a Bar & restaurant but come on don't act like this is my mom's house. We spent in excess of $700 so I will not take my business back ( and I know no one cares) just putting out a warning if you're planning to host a large group at the YardHouse. DON'T DO IT !!!!",

Twice now we've been turned away (even asking for patio seating) because of our well behaved, certified dog. So twice now we've gone upstairs to McFadden's to open arms and amazing service. Your loss, Yardhouse. Currently there is a French Bulldog party beside us on the patio. So cute.",

My husband and I just left the Town Square location, and our server's name was Seth.  Let me just say, incredible experience!!  He showed up to our table within seconds.  He had a huge smile on his face, and it actually seemed genuine.  There were some new menu items that had been added since our last visit, Seth knew about all of the new items.  He answered all of our questions without skipping a beat.  Best part about it...he didn't seem annoyed at all.  He was very pleasant and informative.    Our food arrived very quickly and was just as delicious as always.  Seth came back to check on us a few times, but we had nothing but great things to say.  He never let our drinks get less than half full, and he anticipated our needs like a True professional!!  Everyone knows that Yard House has great food and a great happy hour.  I decided to write this five star review because I'm sure that not everyone knows how fantastic Seth's service is!!  My husband and I were so happy that we were seated in his section, especially when we saw most of the other servers.  They just looked so miserable...(mostly) smiling while they were at their tables...and then frowning as they turned away.  I don't think they know that their attitudes come across and can sometimes ruin a dining experience.  Seth was incredible.  I really wanted to let a manager know how much I appreciated him, and I would have...if I saw one at any time during our meal.  I really wish I had seen a manager walk by or come check on any tables.  They really should know what a great employee they have working for them!",

We came for a friend's birthday and about half our group arrived 20 minutes before the other half so the waiter took our drink orders until the others arrived. About 4 out of the 8 ordered drinks and it took him 30 minutes to finally return with 4 beers - this is no exaggeration. Once the other half arrived he got them their drinks and then we didn't see him for a long while and had to flag him down to order our food. Luckily the food was fast, but that's because our waiter had no part in that. He never once came over to check on us as see if we needed anything else like drink refills or ask if the food was ok. The busboys cleared off our table when we were done and once again we sat and sat and sat waiting for our waiter to come over and bring the check. Once he was done flirting with a group of girls at the next table over he finally stopped by to ask if we wanted the check. After that it took another 20 minutes to finally get the check. I understand we were a large group of people, but it was a Thursday night and it was not at all busy. And I'm sure he had it in the back of his head that he was getting his 18% auto gratuity due to the group, but he could have made a lot more if he stopped by to get people more drinks.   The food however was good and everyone was happy with their selections. I just can't give this place more than 2 stars because of the horrible service.",

A decent wait later she came back to say \"I guess i will be your server so what can I get you?\" I ordered a beer and she just blankly stared at me for a while so I assumed she needed my id and started digging in my purse which seemed to annoy her (in her defense I am only 25 so I cut her some slack there.) We put in our order but when the spinach dip appetizer came out the chips provided looked burnt and definitely tasted so, so we had to wait for our server to stop talking to coworkers in the kitchen (we had a clear view from our booth) to gesture her over and ask for a new batch that weren't nearly black. (Again, gave her slack on this because she didn't run the food to see the chips before they landed on the table) but then she must have forgotten our request because we didn't get the chips until our actual meal came out. And they were plain tortilla chips, not the same ones we originally received. She again sat in the kitchen talking to other servers, probably annoyed she had to take more tables since it was fairly slow (as a food server I am fairly positive she only had one table as we were seated that had paid before our meal came, and one other table of three men ordered a beer each as we ate our food). Only making note of that to say there's no way she was just very busy. I get bad days but this girl hates her job and just wanted to get out and made it very apparent that she couldn't do that until we got out of her table. For very \"meh\" food that wasn't great or terrible, the server is the deciding factor to make or break the experience and Veronica made it a definite bust. Won't be back- and if I am I'll make sure to sit at the bar top where the working staff can't hide.",

    "text": "I've been here twice over the past 3 months, first trip 5 stars, second 3 stars, average 4 stars.  The atmosphere is really inviting, great for groups and reflective of what a tap house should be.  First trip I ordered the half order jambalaya, second trip the seared ahi tuna sandwich on rye.    It's hard to make a good jambalaya that isn't too salty, most are, and the YH hit it on the head.  The shrimp were large, and sat on top a cup plateau of rice, with the chicken, crawfish, and sausage in a moat of spicy cream sauce around.  Some of the best jambalaya I've had and would certainly order again.  The second round was the ahi tuna sandwich.  I was a little suspect out the gate with it coming on rye, but had a little trust from the last trip and how great the jambalaya was.  As the plate sat down, I could tell the ahi tuna was not seared to rare, but more of a medium well, cooked white with only traces of pink, bummer.  Hoping the toasted rye bread would compliment the meat and somewhat pickup where it left off, it didn't, and just made the sandwich more difficult to handle, literally.  On the upside, the peppercorn aioli and caramelized onions saved the sandwich from a certain fate in the back kitchen's garbage can.  Normally, I would have sent it back, but I was with my boss for dinner and decided to suck it up rather than act like a food snob for \"overcooking cooking my ahi tuna\", not a good look.  This place is pricey, perhaps over priced in some respect, but if they can pull off all their dishes as well as they did the jambalaya, I'll come back for not just the beer.",

The food is good not great...I do however think their pizza is amazing and their Ahi poke appetizer and love their calamari.  Their drinks are great! There is a huge variety of drinks, beer, and wine! They have a great happy hour from 3 to 6 and another that starts at 8. The prices aren't bad. They have TV's all along the bar area so you can watch sports if your into that.   Cool spot to chill with friends and family.",

    "text": "Big fan of yard house especially this location at Town Square, because it's a usual family friendly spot for happy hour where the parents can enjoy food and a few adult beverages and then walk it off at Town Square afterwards :)  Yet it's also a cool spot to hang with co-workers or friends.  A good mix of either, yet when your their with the family you don't feel awkward because so many other people are having family nights out and then when you are there with adults only, you aren't bothered by all the kids around, which is pretty rare to find a place that can manage to do both at the same time.  Maybe because it's a little dim and louder inside, but either way how the booths and tables are set up it's not too loud where you can't hear each other talk.  Happy hour menu is one of the best I think in town.  A variety of good choices that aren't just appetizer size, but could be full meals, so getting a good amount for what you pay for.   Garlic noodles, poke stack, sliders, onion stack and cheese pizza for the kids are our go-tos.  I have had items off the happy hour menu and those were delicious too.  I don't think I've ever had anything I don't like here.  Recently had the mushroom lettuce wraps while doing the Daniel fast and those were really good as well.  A good local go to spot for us, especially for Family Friday nights at Town Square :)",

The only thing bringing them down a star is the ambiance, I guess you can say. It's definitely on the darker and louder side, but I can't complain too much since they have TVs around the restaurant playing any game you can think of.

It was a great decision. We ordered some beers, The Lobster Crab and Artichoke Dip and the Chicken Nachos. The Crab dip was really good and served with both chips and pita bread. The Chicken Nachos had a ton of guacamole, cheese, sour cream and good sized chunks of chicken. I am always on the hunt for delicious nachos and the Yard House nachos were great. The chips were nice and crispy and didn't get soggy like some nachos, when they sit under all the toppings. We will definitely be back for their happy hour and a full lunch/dinner. The service was also great. From the hostesses, to our waitress, the servers were happy and helpful. Always good to find a new spot to eat",

    "text": "For someone who's frequented Yard House often for the last several years, I was shocked to have had such a terrible experience while having our baby shower at this location this past Saturday . I reserved the patio area for my baby shower from 2-4pm over a month ago and had an awesome experience with Kourtney, the Event Coordinator for Las Vegas . She was great , we preordered our food and set all the details in advance, including 30mins of set up time beforehand since we'd be hosting a huge party.  We arrive at the agreed time (1:30pm), are not allowed to set up . Actually , there were people who were JUST seated on the patio (which should have been reserved). Guests began to arrive and we weren't allowed to start setting up until maybe 1:50pm, and our section was moved to some other tables on the patio . (In all fairness, the manager on duty at the time did provide a few comped appetizers for our guests due to the inconvenience). We (fiance and myself) arrive and greet our guests . A waitress by the name of Crystal (she wears a ponytail with bangs) walked by our table and we asked her for water for ourselves and other guests who were waiting for water refills . (We requested a pitcher of water for each table to avoid this whole issue, but were told Yard House does not provide them.) She huffed and puffed , walking off and returned about 10minutes later with a disgusted look on her face and only 2 waters. I don't think she realized we were the guests of honor because we were SHOCKED by her lack of hospitality (but I was the only pregnant person there) . Please allow me to mention that ALL the other waitresses and waiters were AMAZING !!!! Crystal was the only terrible one . My 11 year old asked for water 3 or 4 times before actually receiving it and was treated so poorly by this waitress . Her attitude with our guests, who traveled domestically and internationally to attend our baby shower, was disgusting , to say the least . More than 8 of our guests complained about her by name .  There were several other instances where this waitress provided inaccurate information to our guests regarding the menu - we preordered food , this is the food we would pay for our guests to have , if the guests wanted additional drinks or alcohol, they would need to pay for those options . This waitress advised our guests if they did not want the food we offered , they could order off the regular menu and the hosts would pay for them . Not accurate !!!!!  We reached the end of our event , we received a bill for items that NO ONE in our party ordered . Come to find out , this waitress (Crystal) billed us for other customers on the patio . We knew this because the customers ordered vegan burgers and garden salads (which we never ordered.) To be frank , nothing we ordered was vegan .  Everything was very heavy and honestly, unhealthy food such as sliders, chicken wings, fries , artichoke dips, fried Mac and cheese . None of these options would make sense to anyone who's vegan . Had our reservation for the entire patio been honored, this would have NEVER happened . In addition to this billing issue, instead of taking responsibility for this mistake, Crystal accused our guests of eating and leaving without paying for these items . How insulting !!??? We thought the whole reason we preselected items was to provide an easy experience for our guests and we fully expected to cover the bill at the end for the items we provided . Not our guests . Adding insult to injury , Crystal refused to explain which tables these charges came from or even how these ended up on our bill . She kept repeating \"you can talk to the manager\".  The manager (who was very nice and understanding) ended up taking a few of the incorrect items off the bill once we explained the issue but this doesn't excuse any of the mistreatment from Crystal . She's a disgusting , rude, disrespectful and demeaning human being and she should NEVER be allowed to work in the hospitality industry . Because of this experience , I have sent this review to corporate and will NEVER return to any Yard House establishment . We were thoroughly embarrassed in front of our guests (trust me, we have NO issue paying a few hundred dollars for food) and WE (not the waitress) apologized profusely to the guests who were accused of eating and leaving without paying, when in reality, the guests who ordered the vegan meals on the patio (CLEARLY separate from our party) clearly ate and did not pay since their items appeared on our bill . This was clearly racially motivated (we are racially diverse and indigenous group) and I'll never ever step foot in another establishment owned or operated by Yard House . Unorganized , disrespectful , demeaning and irresponsible . Thanks Crystal , you are an embarrassment to the establishment .",

He normally likes A good steak but opted to eat light too and ordered the lunch size portion.  We had to wait about 10 minutes to be seated at 545pm on a Wednesday.

It became apparent that we made a terrible decision.   A few minutes into our dinner the table near us with 3 women and 4 children started screaming with ear deafening screams and would run around causing servers to dodge them without tripping.  This continued for our entire meal.  The staff never talked to the table or made any attempt to get them to behave.  Who goes for a Beer or drink and dinner to listen to screaming kids?  Seriously.  If I made that kind of commotion I would be thrown out. I caught the managers attention. Explained the situation and he was aware of the problem.  He offered to buy us a round of drinks. I declined but he insisted.  The funny end to this is. I ended up paying the same as I would have without the manager giving me a discount. Not sure how that happened.",

We were intrigued with the very positive reviews and over 100 beers on draft!!!  The location is tucked within the Town Square near the airport and south of the strip. We walked in and were amazed to see all of the kegs behind the windows!  There were several people seated in the lobby area but we inquired about sitting at the bar and she told us we were welcome to sit there as it was open seating and she stated if we had any difficulties finding a seat to come back and let her know.   We were able to find two chairs at the bar and were immediately greeted with drink and food menus.  We were definitely impressed by the beer and menu options!  We decided to order the queso appetizer, it is served with both chips and flour tortillas.  My wife ordered the two taco entree which came with rice and beans while I ordered the carnivore pizza. The interior is very clean and comfortable and it was fun to sit at the bar and watch the Saints and Vikings game.   Our food arrived in a timely manner and looked and tasted delicious. We were really impressed with the entire  experience. We wish we had a Yard House in Reno!",

    "text": "Very busy!!! This restaurant is located at the Town Square Mall.  It is near Gameworks.  It was just after the holidays so everyone was still going to the mall.  The parking lot was very full but was lucky enough to find a parking nearby.  I parked by h&m which isn't too far from Yardhouse.  They do have happy hour from 3p-6p which I sadly missed :(   As we walked into the restaurant, there was a lot of people waiting.... It was very crowded inside especially because It was too cold to wait outside.  We waited for about 15-20 minutes which isn't too bad.  There is open seating at the bar but we had kids so we got a nice booth in the corner.  Once we sat down, we were handed menus. Our server came to us in about 2-3 minutes to take our drink orders.  It did take a while for our drinks to come in but understandable.  We ordered 3 kids meals and they each come with a drink, entree with 2 sides, and a choice of dessert for only $6.99! My friend got the gumbo and I decided to get the Margherita pizza and truffle fries.    The 2 adult orders surprisingly came out before the kids meals.  The kids ordered Mac n cheese and teriyaki chicken.  The kids juices also came after the meals because they told us that the bar was backed up.  Everything did taste great though!! The pizza was very hot and delicious.  Cheesy just the way I liked It.  The truffle fries were awesome!!! I'm craving some right now.  I also had the kids Mac n cheese which didn't really have much flavor.    My tab was maybe about $20 which isn't too bad for a whole pizza.  I would come again but would like to come for happy hour!  Oh! And they are also vegetarian friendly!!",

So me and some friends went to hit up yard house for a good happy hour. Wow great !half the prize! Mmmm so I decided to have a cup of decaf ( I know I know youre probably saying say whaaaat ? decaf happy hour? ) yes i was just feeling it okay? Sadly when the coffee came arrrrh it was not even warm nor hot it was just room temp? ( they had to brew a new one)Mmmm wuz up with that? Then comes my margherita pizza? Ohhhh myyyyy! Yukky soggy pizza? Ekkkkkkk the hard cold pizza from last night when i was in  college tasted so much better and that was when i was already recuperating from a hang over and that was the only thing i could find in my fridge. So yard house this time its a NEY! Oh yeah service? My server was short during the orders and the serving but when he was giving the check he was super nice and chatty... mmmmmm why is that I wonder. Happy happy hour guys! Try it your time . Maybe it was just that day :)",

They have a set happy hour menu which is a list of items from the regular menu that are 50% off. I am always happy with the hospitality of all of the employees at Yard House and it is one of the reasons I keep coming back. After being seated, we took a glance over the eclectic tap list Yard House has to offer and settled on the Split Shot milk stout from Elysian Brewing Company. The new beer glassware at Yard House is unique to their restaurants! My girlfriend and I split the chicken nachos and onion ring tower. These are our go to dishes and Yard House is consistent with the serving size and quality. The onion rings are breaded well so there's a nice crunch on the first bite. The chicken nachos are the best happy hour nachos in the city in my opinion based on size and quality. Chips topped with refried beans, cheese, chicken, two dollops of sour cream, and a big scoop of guacamole make the perfect late night meal. Nachos, onion rings, and a pint for $22 is a pretty good deal. We will be back!",

There is option for outside seating which is perfect for summer nights and is often times accompanied with misters to cool you down.   YH is always a safe choice for an outing location because the food does not disappoint and neither do their drink options. They have a very large selection of beer (if you like cider or just don't feel like drinking a beer/cocktail, try the ace pineapple cider or Stella cider) and even better -- they have great happy hour times!   Their daytime happy hour is 3 to 6pm. Late night happy hour begins at 10pm until they close. Happy hour here includes a wide range of both food and drink options for a fraction of the price. Unlike some other restaurants, Yard House's happy hour food options are desirable and the portions/prices are reasonable as well.   Give Yard House a visit if you are looking for a drink and a small bite, or just a full on dinner! This place is versatile. :)",

    "text": "Came here for happy hour and we ordered calamari, traditional Buffalo chicken wings, onion ring tower, BBQ chicken pizza and blue crab cakes. All of that for 2 people, we were out of control.   Buffalo wings and the BBQ chicken pizza were very good. We asked for more Buffalo sauce though as the sauce was too dry on the wings. The pizza has thin crust, which I like. Definitely would order these again.   Onion ring tower is just above average, in my opinion. At first, I thought we would only get 5 rings, but they actually gave us A LOT. They came with two kinds of sauce. Their sauces are super duper good. They brought the onion rings to another level. I don't know how they make their sauces, but I wish I knew their recipes. I'm not even a fan of sauces, but I like those.   Calamari and crab cakes were just mediocre. I wasn't too impressed.   Apart from happy hour menu, I usually come here for lunch and get the lunch specials or Korean pork tacos - LOVE these tacos!!!!",

    "text": "This review is towards my take-out experience with this establishment.  I'm sure this is a great place to dine-in as there's a lot of people.  I'm a fairly new delivery driver and this place doesn't have it together.  I accepted the pick-up delivery at 8:08pm that's when customer ordered the food on a Monday night.  I get there at 8:22pm as I was fairly far, hit \"Arrived\" to let them know I'm here.  I checked in at the counter to show the order I'm picking up to this lady and she said \"It'll be a moment\"  Waited a good 15 minutes and it was getting crowded so I waited outside.  Now normally when the order is ready to be picked up, I'll get a notification.  I didn't get notice.  Waited for another 10 minutes and I go back inside to see if it's ready.  Nothing.  So the lady finally ask which order I'm waiting for...  I'm thinking to myself \"are you kidding me??\"   They should know exactly which order is it.. it's not like there's 3 other delivery drivers waiting...    I'm the only one there...  So turns out the order was partially ready and was just sitting there.  I'm like \"what's missing?\"  two drinks but she needs to get an \"To-go specialist\" to get these drinks for me.  And this \"specialist\" was no where in sight...   I'm like freaking great...  waited another 5-10 minutes for her to show up... then she takes another 5-10 minutes to pour two drinks.  I'm thinking \"is this really happening?\"  It's obvious they're short staffed, and the staff doesn't know what to do with delivery orders....   I finally got everything at 9:05pm...  takes almost an hour... what a joke.    Avoid take-out from this place...   and just let your driver do the waiting for you.",

    "text": "This was my first time at the Town Square location, as I usually visit the one in the Linq Promenade. While the beer and menu are the same, the atmosphere is much more relaxed and mellow than the one on the strip, as expected. I dined for lunch on the weekend and found myself really wishing it was happy hour because they offer such great portions at a discounted price.   Our table ordered a few salads and sandwiches, a burger, and macaroni and cheese. No complaints about the food; the portions are great and the food was tasty. The menu in general is pages long and offers a little bit of everything with convenient half and full size options.   As for the beer, this place has it all! I discovered a very special watermelon IPA that was only $8/pint and 10%ABV! One pint did the trick and it was really fun choosing from the pages and pages of specialty beer on tap. They do offer 2 free samples, which I didn't realize, so I'll be sure to take advantage of this on my next trip.    I think I definitely prefer the other location; my fun-meter wasn't as high while dining here, but I would be sure to come back if I'm ever shopping at the Town Square outdoor mall.",

I just ordered a grilled cheese with French fries instead of the tomato bisque that it usually comes with. OMG ! The best grilled cheese I've eaten in the whole US so far ! It was made with 4 different kinds of cheeses : Fontina, Gorgonzola, Cheddar and Swiss. Made with artisan bread and also slices of roasted tomatoes. Perfectly grilled with the running melted cheeses. Sooooo good ! The French fries were cut very thin so they were very crispy, not fattening at all and so much better than the big ones with skin you usually get.  So that small \"nothing special\" meal turns out to be simply great !  I have to say we were a party of 8 and everybody loved their meal. Pasta, tuna, tacos, grilled salmon, no left overs.  Look at the pictures to see the sizes of the draft beers. Humongous !  The only thing we didn't go crazy for was desert. We mostly had Creme Brulee. But it had bananas on top of it instead of the usual crispy caramelized sugar and chocolate at the bottom. Not exactly what we expected. Good but definitely not to \"die\" for like the rest of our meal...",

But this time was even better, Tim was our waiter and he was quite efficient. They wanted to try some beers and he made suggestions and brought samples.  He was helpful with questions, kept our glasses full and brought the kids menu without us having to ask as we weren't seated with it.  better service led to better experience. S The mac and cheese was a big hit, the adult and the kid version.  the roasted turkey melt was also a nice sandwich with a lot of flavor.  I got the spicy tuna roll and I always love it. it's my usual go to option there! Its not your typical roll, almost like a spicy tuna cake with edamame, avocado, and tuna mostly without any rice.  It also is one big roll. Yummy as usual.... Like the soups too and the lunch sandwich or pizza and soup option but wasn't in mood. The kids meal comes with a fruit pop and side too which is way too much with their portion sizes! Lol...  we were all too full to try dessert but they sounded good too. lol.  another positive experience here, just go hungry as big portions and so many options! Definitely the go to place at town square....",

    "text": "I've been to Town Square many of times but never stepped foot inside of Yard House til now. The resturaunt was huge and the staff was very friendly and welcoming. Smiles and good times was all over the building, not only from the staff but also the customers.  The food was amazing and if you're a beer lover such as myself they have over 100 brews to choose from. The selection included everything from lagers to ale's and even mixed beer drinks if you want to mix raspberry Lindermans Framboise w/ a chocolate flavored beer. And worse case scenario, let's say that you can't make up your mind on a beer selection; they also have samples of every brew to find the perfect one for your taste buds... I prefer Peroni.  The dinner was delicious. My girlfriend ordered a spicy chicken flatbread sandwich with parmesan & herb fries. I had to take a bite lol, and that was <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>! Chicken was grilled to perfection with avacado, cabbage, and spicy mustard. I ordered the BBQ cheddar burger! Heaven on earth. 1/2 lb sirloin cooked to order, melted cheddar cheese, smoked applewood bacon on a sweet Hawaiian bun and sweet potato fries on the side. Best burger I've ever had hands down.  The only downer I seen about the place is that its extremely loud inside of Yard House. I'm not knocking anyone's fun but it was hard to carry a convo with my girlfriend without shouting at eachother and we're sitting next to eachother in a booth. But there's also outside dining so that probably could've been more peAceful to enjoy a nice elegant dinner. Definitely is the spot if you're having a nice date and get hungry :-)",

Which were both packed.  So it was super. Fucking. Noisy. Which was great for my anxiety!  Food wise, we got the macaroni and cheese which I thought was really good. And we also got the thai chicken pizza off of the Gardenia menu. I was pretty impressed with all the things on the vegetarian menu, and they even have little V's next to the food names to indicate it is animal free. The thai chicken of course was not real chicken, not sure what brand they use and forgot to ask, but it was really amazing.  The waiter was cool, and frequently came back to check on us and brought our food out pretty fast despite the amount of traffic there was.  The only I recommend is, if you hate people, don't come here!   It's super loud, you'll have to shout out your waiter to get them to hear you. By the end of the night I wanted to cry cause the sound was unbearable. But that's just cause I'm a weirdo! Everyone else seemed to be having a good time.",

Come here during Happy Hour with a group of friends and/or family, grab a brewski and some well drinks and it's a guaranteed good time!   Other than that--food is decent, more salty than not and comes out a little slow.   In my opinion: DO - Get a little tipsy and stumble your way over to one of the other food joints located around Town Square.  NOT - Eat here, if you can help it.",

The host that showed us to our table was so kind. He chatted the entire way talking about how his day was.  It is usually pretty packed so I would make a reservation or get there a little bit early to grab a table. Its really loud especially when there is a sports game on so I would not recommend going if you are taking a date there and would like to hear her!   I always order the mushroom lettuce wraps with Tofu.  It is an appetizer but fills me up like an entree. Pricey are very reasonable including drink prices!

Although it seemed like it was really busy due to the number of people standing around near the hostess table, we only had to wait a couple minutes before being given the option to sit outside(quieter) or inside. We ended up sitting in a booth inside.   A major reason to go to Yard House is the beer selection. I love Lindeman's Framboise, so when I saw the Youngberry Chocolate on the menu I had to try it.  It is Lindeman's Framboise & Young's Double Chocolate Stout and oh so tasty.   For my meal, I had the Ahi Crunch salad was good but not great, mainly due to boring veggies. The ahi was seared perfectly and well seasoned, I think I would have been better off with the ahi poke bowl.   We ended up skipping Blue Martini. Drinks were cheaper at Yard House for the guys (and martinis are always $10 at Yard House versus the $12+ pricetag at Blue Martini when it's not happy hour!!!) and the atmosphere was nice and laid back so we just stayed there. Yard House is definitely a place we will go back to.",

I have been to Yardhouse before in a few other cities, but had a friend tell me last week about their vegetarian menu.  They use a meat substitute called gardein and it can be used in any of their dishes but they even have a section of the menu devoted to all of their vegetarian dishes. I decided to choose the chicken & veggie bowl with jasmine rice.. I expected it to be like a teriyaki sauce, but I have to admit that was my own assumption... In spite of not being sweet like I expected, it was a very delicious meal that I thoroughly enjoyed. My friend ordered the veggie chicken strips with a side of sweet potato fries. Of course I had to try this and I have to admit I would have loved to have ordered those too...  I think this is going to be another one of my new spots to frequent as it can totally fit into my diet and keep others around me happy too...  yay!!!  PS: Can someone tell me why this isn't classified under vegetarian?? I would have found it a lot sooner...",

Food menu: at least to me it was somewhat plain (yet overwhelming with choices) and I couldn't find anything that attracted me so I went for an old favorite, buffalo wings (more on that later) Beer menu: huge and somewhat confusing, browsing it can take some time and apparently that is not to the liking of the wait stuff, but more on that later. We had some soups, onion and creamed tortilla- xlnt, had some salads- very good the wife had sliders, fairly plain and tasteless and 3 out of the 4 went home in a doggy bag, the wings I ordered were ok but some of them were pink in the middle and I had to send them back while lecturing about salmonella- not a good thing. Beer: while the micros are good the prices and quantity are not worth the entry price (imo) paying almost $9 for what looks like 7 ounces of Belgian pirate ale is a bit rich for my blood, further more those tall \"yard house\" glasses while they look cool are completely impracticable, drinking out of them is painful and  uncomfortable, wish there was an option of a traditional stein instead.  All in all I found that its not as spectacular as describes and there are better options Vegas wide for like (concept) places. lets just say that I expected more then received.",

My review is completely based on this location only. I come to this Yard House a bit too often during their happy hour. I love it because of their late night happy hour. After a long day of school and work, I'm usually done way after the normal happy hour ends. Fortunately, Yard House caters to the night owls out there and starts at 10pm on Sunday-Thursday.  Now, I'm sure none of this is new to anyone, every Yard House in the nation offers late night.   Here's why I love this location: The bartenders here are the best in town. I have come to love the 6 main guys that work the later shift. I usually have one of them pick out my beers for me, and he's always spot on as far as my cravings go. The bars on the strip could really learn a bit about service from these guys. I wouldn't recommend sitting at a table. SIT AT THE BAR! No wait and better service.",

    "text": "I have lived in Vegas for now over a year, and I have to say that by far this was the worst restaurant I have been too.   When we first came in it looked fun, loud, dark - perfect for a younger crowd looking to have some fun. We decided to sit outside because Vegas weather is to be enjoyed as much as possible and were quickly concerned by the size of the menu.   I have never seen a menu this large. Yes 2 pages are of the brews that they have on tap but the other 5 pages (back and front) are of food they serve. They serve pizza, soup, salad, vegetarian, tacos, fish, sushi, dessert, sandwiches, burgers, pasta EVERYTHING. This is when I got nervous. Usually when I see a menu over 2 pages I'm wondering if they're a \"Jack of all trades and a King of NONE.\" As I looked through the menu every item had this grandiose listing of ingredients that looked as if they belonged in a high end restaurant. As far as I knew I was in a restaurant that cherished beer and was named the \"YARD HOUSE\". It was obvious that they were overcompensating or just flat out LYING about what they put in their food. After reading a novel of a menu for over 10 minutes I thought I had finally decided what I wanted. I ordered a ranch side salad and their \"famous\" mac n cheese. My husband ordered a BBQ burger - well done with french fries. We did not order any brew.   When they brought out my salad I was surprised to see that they had used a hot plate to serve my cold salad. It did not help the taste. The lettuce itself was very weak and not crunchy at all like Iceberg lettuce generally is. After eating a few bites I saw something dark and shiny in the bottom of my bowl...I began to dig it out and realized that it was a long thin dark black hair. I stopped eating.   A few minutes after I stopped eating I asked for our waitress to take the salad away due to the hair and she apologized and asked if I would like something else instead. Just to be safe I ordered the Caesar salad. The salad quickly came out within two minutes and I was excited to try it because I LOVE Caesar dressing. I took a huge bite and for some reason my nose and my pallete tasted and smelled something skunky...I had assumed it may have been the man who had just walked by and continued to take another bite. After that bite I knew it was the dressing. The Yard House had tried to \"remake\" caesar dressing and it was awful. It tasted like someone had just rubbed their dirty gym sock all over my salad. I didn't take another bite.  Shortly after that our meals had arrived and as I am the BIGGEST mac and cheese fan I was super excited to taste their rendition of an old favorite. They had used some \"fancy\" pasta with a few different cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms and a bread crumble on top. The cheese sauce was good, the pasta itself was way overcooked and too soft, the bacon was soft..which was not appealing and some of the chicken was cold as if they had frozen slices and just heated them for the dish. I pushed everything but the pasta and the cheese to the side and tried to enjoy it. After a couple of bites I started to feel really sick. I'm not really sure what caused it but I honestly felt like I was going to throw up. It might have had something to do with the fact that a few seconds before the table next to us OUTSIDE had ordered fish and I was drowning in bad fish odor at our table. My husband even complained of the stench. That fish was IN NO WAY FRESH. It smelt like rotten salmon that had been sitting under a heat lamp all day. I almost gagged when they first brought it out. I think that, and the combo of feeling like I ate a dirty sock and soft pasta may have made me sick.   My husband said that his burger was alright, and the fries were okay, but really stringy.   Halfway into eating my mac and cheese a woman came out to speak to me about the hair that I had found in my salad. She let me know that it was NOT a hair, and that it was actually corn silk, left over from the \"fresh\" corn they had just chucked to make my salad. I've eaten fresh corn, canned corn and frozen corn all of my life. They have very distinct differences. I know, that that was frozen corn. It was gooey and hard to chew, fresh corn just pops in your mouth. I don't know why anyone had come out to argue with me about what I found in my salad. Last time I chucked corn the silk was usually white to a yellowish color. Not BLACK. Nice try though.  Anyway, my husband and I both left feeling very nauseous and the drive back to Henderson was NOT a pleasant one. The entire drive home I was trying my hardest not to throw up. I don't want to explain what the rest of my night was like but I'm sure you get the picture. We wont be back here.",

    "text": "Yelp Challenge! Started 8/20/2011 (15 of 365).  My usual order during happy hour goes something like this; don't worry, I share it with one other person!  - Truffle Fries.  It's not on the Happy Hour list but it's only $4.  You can't go wrong with that considering truffle oil costs $20 a bottle!  These fries are bomb!  -Garlic Noodes w/ Shiitake mushrooms.  Sounds simple but the dish is really flavorful.  -Sliders.  Pastrami or Classic.  You can never go wrong with these especially at 4 fairly sized sliders for $6.95 during Happy Hour!  They don't come in your natural hamburger bun, they come in sweet rolls; yum!  You can substitute your fries on this dish for more Truffle fries.   That's how I do!  -Ahi Sashimi.  This is good paired with the Garlic Noodles.    Some other items to try of course are their pizzas.  They're all pretty good, pretty big, and half price during happy hour!  Awesome.    I like sititng in the booths here because they are a perfect distance from the bar and TVs to watch the current sports games while you eat, plus its a good view to people watch.  Sometimes it's nice to eat outside on their patio as well.  Their brownie dessert is pretty good too if you have room for it! Oh, and don't forget the beer.  They have a wide variety to choose from and you can have a whole YARD size glass to yourself.  Good luck with that!",

I guess it depends what you order, the burgers and sandwiches come with a side, but not sure about other items. My sandwich was AMAZING. I did add avocado to it too! I was stuffed at the end and it wasn't a healthy meal but it wasn't heavy either. I'd definitely go back. Remember if you are ordering mixed drinks to say \"light ice\" or you will get 3/4 cup ice and a few drops of alcohol :p",

Dinner is a little pricey so I like to come out more for the happy hour where you can get pizzas, wings, chicken strips, etc.  It's probably a step up above Kona in terms of the happy hour foods.

One thing I don't like about the Town Square location (and this is probably True at all Town Square restaurants)  is that it is the DBC....DBC being Douche Bag Central.....and the later u go, the more u will come across them.

    "text": "Horrible service! My friends brought me on my birthday 7/29. Our server can't tell you her name cause she didn't even introduce herself was the worst server I've ever had. We didn't feel welcomed she'd  roll her eyes every time we asked her something. You can tell she just wanted to get out of there. You know most servers ask \"how's your night going?\", \"what brings you in tonight?\" Or s a simple welcome my name is..... She asked for our drink orders right when I looked up from looking at the menu she was gone I guess we took to long for her. When we got our food she didn't being bring us cutlery, not ketchup, napkins or asked if we needed anything for our meals. I guess I'm suppose to eat my rice and beans with my hands. We asked three different people that walked by our table if they can get it for us of course they said yes but never came back. She finally showed up and brought us some 5-10 minutes later. I understand it's busy but if your working for tips you'd think you'd put some effort into giving A+ that would've been better instead of getting treated like shit. We wanted to go catch the movie but again she was no where to be found finally brought the bill and left right away so we went to the front cause we wanted to leave already the hostess said you have to give it to the server so we saw a guy with a white shirt not sure if he was the manager he took it said the server will take care of it. When she gave it to us guess what she disappeared again so we asked if the hostess can take the check book she said you have to give it to your server I asked can't you take it it's empty mind you she was leaning on the counter talking to the other 2 host I guess if she would've grabbed it the counter would've fell because she wasn't leaning on it. If you want to get treated like shit definitely come here. If you want amazing service go elsewhere cause you won't get that here. I wish I can give them a 0 They don't even deserve a 1.",

They have some neat stuff and the 6 pack samplers change regularly. The food is good, but I can't tell if it's microwaved, so that's almost as bad as being microwaved.  A mix list provides cleaver names for the combos you already know and love. The servers are generally pleasant and helpful and have, at the very least, remembered the scripts for various beer questions that may arise.  It is good, not for everyone, but sometime for me.  If you are in the area to kill time, stop in, have 2 beers and see how you feel about the atmosphere and the selection.",

    "text": "Having finished up with a few errands and hunger took all decision making skills from the wife and I, we settled on Yard House, as we hadn't been there in a while and the food seemed good on previous visits.  We were told it would be 15-20 minutes for a table in the very packed restaurant, no problem, we will enjoy the padded seats for a bit. By the time we sat down and got comfortable, our pager went off, and to the table we ventured.  Weaving through groves of people, we arrived at a table toward the back of the restaurant, furthest from the kitchen. I think the host was trying to talk to us during the trip, however, it is so ungodly loud in there, that I couldn't hear a word he was saying.  Flipping through the menu, neither of us remembered it being that expensive and of course, our lack of decision making skills due to hunger kicked in again and nothing looked good.  I, for the second time in the night, settled and chose the four cheese pizza. One type of food that I had expressly stated I did not want prior to arriving. Oh well, can't win them all.  It seemed to take forever for our server to bring two glasses of water, almost as if they made her go to Lake Mead, fill a jug with water, bring it to a purification center, then make some ice cubes and finally, deliver filled ice water glasses to our table.  Our orders were taken and again, it seemed like an eternity for the food to get delivered. It was an OK pizza, about what you would expect from a non-pizza-centric establishment. I did find it odd though, that the crust was soaked with grease or water or something, and was as flimsy as a wet noodle.  Finishing the food, the service seemed to pick up, plates were cleared almost the instant they were clean, the check was dropped off, a moment later, was picked up, with our payment. Then... the waiting began again. I think Yard House makes the staff bring the credit cards to the issuing bank to extract their funds.  Once we were able to reclaim our card and head to the exit, the wife was almost bowled over by an employee that was on a mission. Escaping into the very windy night, we both agreed this was our last visit to Yard House for the foreseeable future.",

    "text": "Sad to say that I went on a Friday during lent so I had the four cheese pizza rather than my usual meat filled platter. The pizza was pretty darn good though and huge considering during Happy Hour it only cost 6.50. Talk about a deal! My roomie had the Cuban sandwich and said it was AMAZING. Overall the food tasted pretty great and if you during Happy Hour I really think it's hard to beat this level of food for this price. A lot of places serve really small portions for their lunch specials or Happy Hour but I think this place does it right and gives you huge portions hoping you stay around long enough to drink up a nice tab. I for one am willing to fall into this trap any day of the week as long as their food stays on point. Last star is missing because although the service was acceptable it wasn't star worthy.   Great food, good size portions, Happy Hour makes their food cheap so plan accordingly.  (Spinach and cheese dip is pretty awesome btw.)",

It's a tiny little morsel, and just enough to top off a fantastic meal.  It's only around $3, and it's pure heaven.  If you are a chocolate lover,  but are sick of restaurants slaying the \"chocolate cake\" with a mediocre knock off of a good ol' Duncan's Hines box cake--then this is your chance to indulge in a decadent, warm, rich chocolate treat!  As far as dinner goes, I'm a huge fan of the Southern Fried chicken, and my hubby loves the Enchilada Stack.  We've never been unhappy with anything we order, they really know how to make a meal...even if it doesn't look at all like it sounds!  For example, their Mac & Cheese is so much more than \"Mac\" & \"Cheese\".  It's several kinds of cheeses, mushrooms, chicken, oh my!!  We recently ate at a Denver Yardhouse location, and it's consistent with our Las Vegas locations!   Oh, and I totally forgot about their vast array of beer choices--can't miss with this restaurant!",

    "text": "I'd been avoiding Yard House ever since a failed attempt at the Red Rock location: long lines, extra-loud music, spillover crowds, and a \"more here to be seen than to eat\" kind of vibe. There's nothing wrong with a busy, happy, trendy place, of course, especially one advertising more beers than anywhere else in the world, but it's not for boring old me.  But, the menu we'd perused online looked so different and interesting (at least for vegetarians) that I had to give in when my husband pushed for a visit before going to see a movie at Rave. Put anything in Town Square and I'll probably visit it at least once.  Even though it was busy and the music was indeed cranked up, it was my kind of music (classic rock), and the space between tables meant we didn't have to feel like we should introduce ourselves to the family at the next table.   We had two servers during our meal (our first one went on break), and both were as enthusiastic as they were thorough, which is to say amply both. As I ordered, I was pleasantly asked if I'd like my salad dressing on the side, if I was a vegan (so the order could be adjusted if necessary), and - be still my heart - if I was fine with the veggie burger I ordered being a Gardein burger. Seldom do I know what I'm going to get when I order a vegetarian burger. It could be a nuked black-bean patty, it could be a homemade concoction starring bulgur and carrots, or it could be the most dreaded possibility of all: the tasteless Boca puck.  Or it could be the best veggie burger in Las Vegas, which is what I was served at Yard House. Oh boy!  I can't claim it will be the best for every vegetarian. Some people like a strong faux-meat experience, and others want the opposite. I like anything with a traditional burger texture and some kind of spicy flavour with a lot of \"umami\" - fullness, and that's what I got. I went with the potato bun. Fresh, but very squishy. I may try the wheat bun next time.  But before this we'd already been charmed by the appetizers. The Onion Ring Tower - as tall as its name implies - kept luring my fingers back. The rings were crispy but not greasy, with a dust of Parmesan over all.  Throught the meal our lemonades kept coming, each free refill with a ring of sugar around the rim. Okay. We were *definitely* putting Yard House on the short list for sure things.  And, open until 2 a.m.? What was this? And it's a full menu until 2 a.m.? That entire page of Gardein vegetarian items - wings, sliders, thai pizza, sandwiches - plus everything else on the near-novella of a menu is available after most restaurants pack up for the night? And they have half-priced pizzas and appetizers not only during regular happy hour, but also after 10 p.m. (Sunday-Wednesday)? Squeal!",

I blame my actions on fatigue, and pray you don't judge me.  Came here today for lunch at 3pm. Was seated in their lovely patio. Started off with guacamole, it was fine. When it came to our lunches my friend asked if he could have a pizza half pepperoni half BBQ chicken. We were told you can't do half pizzas when they have different sauces. What? He explained he didn't care if the topping ventured onto the wrong sauce (BBQ/tomato) and the kitchen refused. Then came my brilliant order of the Hawaiian poke stack. At this time, an alarm should have sounded in my brain \"Rachel! It's ahi tuna! It's raw! It takes skill and quality to create a sublime product and your at a chain!\". Instead my tummy prevailed, and what I got  was a stringy, chewy, tough, pile of butchered fish.  Lesson learned, when hungry and if you wind up at a chain, pause, think, then order. I do want to mention the staff is great and this in no way reflects on them.",

Veggie \"Beef\" Sliders.. \"Chicken\" Rice Bowl.. Spicy \"Chicken\" Sandwich.. (that's what I got.. Mostly because I've always wanted to say \"Can I get the spicy chicken sandwich please?\" I've never been able to say that before!). Its the Gardein substitute for meat, a gluten-free, soy-based protein that is supposed to duplicate the flavor/taste/texture of meat. I thought it was delish. Moist and Very filling. The aioli was great too. Don't be afraid of the cabbage (I was, I hate cabbage). It's a thin layer, quite sparse and the other flavors conceal the cabbage anyway. I'm not sure if this is a NV thing or a new feature at the chain, bc the last one I went to in So Cal didn't have that many veggie options (they had the regular amount, just not a half of a page in the menu dedicated to soy protein (fake meat) dishes!!  I'd love to give them 5 stars, I really wanted to. The staff was friendly, they called when the order was ready (I picked up), they even had the water I requested all ready to go... But the sweet potato fries weren't cooked all the way through. Not all of them, at least. As a giant fan of sweet potato fries, that is disappointing. It means enough to knock off a star even though YH knocked my socks off with the veggie menu. So stoked about that!",

Maybe people feel more comfortable at a chain, maybe people are just boozehounds, the world may never know.   I like Yard House better for lunch personally because I find the dinner entrees to be a bit overpriced. When it first opened friends constantly wanted to dine here and my wallet cringed as well as my patience as we jammed up against the bar waiting for our table. Once you get past that however, the place is quality. The portions are big and no one can complain about the beer selection (unless, like me, you await the arrival of Yuengling to the west coast, I check every time I go). They have a great selection of food so everyone in the party will be able to find something they're in the mood for. Yard House reminds me of Cheesecake Factory, but substitute cake for beer. The lunch specials are very fairly priced and will fill you up.  The outdoor seating is awesome in the still bearable months of summer and at night prepare to see some sights sashaying over to nearby Blue \"wait this isn't Tao?\" Martini. Good times all around. There are TV's everywhere in this joint, including outdoors, so you won't miss a pass, kick or homerun. Overall I recommend but if you're going for dinner, have a snack before you leave the house to hold you over.",

Love it.  So versatile in your usage with this place.  I've done birthdays, dinner with my parents, happy hour with my friends... all here.    The food is always yum.  Love the fries, love the burgers, love the steak, love the salmon.  Okay there was one thing I wasn't fond of... I got wasabi mashed potatoes one time.  Weird. But I don't like wasabi anyway... had to try it still!  Now I know.  The service is always phenomenal.  Look, I don't like beer, but there is some raspberry beer that doesn't taste like beer... and it's goooood.    I've always had a good time here.  I love the vibe of this place.  They play good music.  It's never dead.  I just, love it.",

    "text": "This is an OK place in my eyes, wouldn't probably wanna go back unless its for the beer. The night itself was amazing because we were there with good friends and it was really fun. The restaurant itself didn't impress me so much and the food didn't exactly take me to an amazing culinary journey.   First of all, I was really impressed by their beer selection. My husband and I shared a Hefeweissen dunkel und it tasted really smooth and good. The service was relatively fast for how crowded the place was. They were trying really hard I thought. Still it took 15 minutes for our waters to come out.  I guess I'm a little bit of a health freak and when I eat things I think about all the good things and bad things of the food for my body. I mean everything did have good flavors and was spiced pretty good, but I couldn't enjoy it so much and left the restaurant thinking 1. Am I going to fit through the door? 2. OMG I'm going to get a hearattache...   The sweet potato fries were very very greasy and there was almost oil dripping from my fingers as I was eating my sandwich. Also, the food was kind of expensive I thought. The entrees were 10 dollars and up and didn't come with a side. They charge extra for the sides.",

I guess that helps explain how good it is (or, wait, I think it is just because of Town Square).    I just liked it a lot more initially because it was a chill local place to go, but now its just like all the tourist places - packed and unwelcoming!!  I may still go there though for the good late-nite happy hour, only as long as they continue to accept reservations.",

    "text": "This is gonna sound like a recurring theme, but I came here for a friend's birthday dinner. Not sure about the other Yard House locations, but this place is GIGANTIC. Ample indoor and outdoor seating with enough TVs to watch any and every sports game.  With their burgers, Asian influenced fare, pastas, and Gardein selections, their menu has something for everyone and it's just a matter of deciding what you want most. Eventually, I settled on a surf and turf burger, which has a beef patty topped with lobster, grilled asparagus, and a swiss and tomato bearnaise. The burger was all right, but I should've gone with my gut instinct and ordered the pepper jack burger. I dipped my fries into the bearnaise instead of putting it on my burger. Oops. Let me just say that I'm just a sucker for crisp fries and savory dipping sauces.  Figured I might as well get a drink since I could walk it off around Town Square. One hpnotini for me please! It's a balanced mix of pineapple juice, pineapple rum, hpnotiq, and vodka. Basically, sweet + fruity + alcohol = girly drink. I'd drink it again, but I'd want to try their Snake Bite, the birthday guy's favorite, before making repeat orders.  Even with about 20 or more people in our group, the wait staff never stopped being accommodating, patient, and attentive. Major kudos to them for being amazing to us despite having a full house on a Saturday night.  Celebration or not, Town Square's Yard House is a hot and casual spot for watching the game with some pals or get-togethers for a meal.",

Not only are the host upfront not the most welcoming but so is the rest of their staff. It's really hard to find good service now we live in a city that constantly deals with guest service and yet it's always a fail to walk out of a restaurant feeling welcomed.   I understand happy hour probably isn't TE ideal time to get full service but it doesn't give anyone the right to lose their manners. Not 1 excuse me, thank you or anything came from our server Carl. From snatching the menus to throwing down the straws and that face he would make as we placed our orders was just completely unprofessional. Since we had the kids with us I stepped away from the table to contact a manager.   When I approached the hostess stand the gentlemen at the stand was assisting other guest. A lady walked up with another unwelcoming look on her face I approached her in regards to speaking with a manager. When the manager arrived I informed him on the service, he was apologetic and took 2 kids meals and our desert off the bill.    The happy hour is well worth it. The food is good and the portions are great! Not to mention the delicious raspberry beer.",

And then to find out they have locations all over california too. Go figure.   The food is awesome. I tried from salads to pastas to burgers to sushi...and its amazing. The happy hour is the best!! I've ordered a lot from the happy hour menu that can feed 4 people or more and our bill was a pretty good deal for the amount of food we've ordered.   I like that Yard House has the outdoor area with MISTERS for the summer because we all know how HOT vegas gets!! The service is really friendly and helpful too. And as a tip for fun! What my friends and I do on a \"night out\" we hit up Yard House first for happy hour drinks and then head to BLUE MARTINI upstairs to dance the night away! I never get disappointed.",

Usually the place good but tonight they bombed out.  1) waiter needs to go back to bussing tables he's not ready to be serving  2) nothing worse than just staring your salad and the entree comes.  Really hate that and it's partly due to inexperience with a server who puts the whole order in at once.  3) don't take my food you brought too early and set it in a warmer for whatever time it takes us to eat our first round and then bring it back. When we tell you we want fresh you better do so or you will get a nasty review like this one   So bottom line you guys screwed the pooch and lost another group of customers",

    "text": "Great new selections like the \"snacks\" and there are indicators for Vegetarian and \"under 600 calories\" meals!  Another restaurant that I have frequented quite a few times since it first opened In 2008 and have sampled most of the menu. It's been a while since I've visited, but I decided to keep it simple and go back to my favorites.  SPICY TUNA ROLL: They'll warn you EVERY time - it's not really a sushi roll. It's a beautiful stack of chopped cucumbers and edamame, layered with spicy tuna, and topped with avocado. A little sriracha, sesame oil, and sauce around it to add some flavor. Delicious and light! ORGANIC TOMATO BISQUE (WITH GRILLED CHEESE): You don't have to get the grilled cheese, but you haven't had a grilled cheese sandwich until you've had this one. Crusty, oily artisanal bread with four fabulous cheeses and tomato oozing between their slices. With the hearty tomato bisque, crazy good. FIRECRACKER WINGS: I'm not crazy about wings nor do I order this often, but the \"firecracker\" sauce is just damn good. Zesty, spicy, sweet, and very flavorful! Give them a whirl to get away from the boring hot, medium, or wild wing sauces. PEACH APPLE COBBLER: It's just really good. Not much to explain. I tried it the first time in the Trio Dessert Sampler and I ended up liking this one better than their souffles. The \"cobbler\" part is really great.  There's H/H in the middle of the day (M-F) from 3pm-6pm and at night after 10pm (not Fri and Sat), so that's a great time to go for great deals on their appetizers and alcohol. I'm not a big fan of their martinis (not sure why, but I've tried several on multiple occasions and they are really terrible), however, there are people that love them. May just not be my style.",

Our server was Lisa I believe and she was great. Always checked on us. Our drinks came first then our food.  My order did come out a little later then the rest of my party but I didn't really mind cause I've had something to drink and some appetizers.  Lisa did notice that my food wasn't out yet right when we were about to ask her.  She came out with my food and it was warm, it would have tasted better hot. I didn't make a big deal out of it as she was accommodating and apologized. She asked if I wanted to have them make another one but of course I didn't want to wait again when everyone is almost done so I said it was fine.  She insisted she'll get the GM as that wasn't ok.  The GM came out apologized, and asked if I wanted anything else and I said no. She also comp'd the meal.   Overall, good experience.  I appreciated that they comp'd the meal but it wasn't necessary as their apology was enough and asked if I wanted a new plate; I just didn't have time to wait.",

I'd have to say it's the second yummiest thing I've ever eaten, only behind the salty caramel macaron ice cream sandwich from Ginger Elizabeth in Sacramento.  I shared the pudding with someone on this particular visit but not next time! :p  If you are a caramel lover like I am get that dessert for sure!  For my entree I ordered their mac and cheese which you can't go wrong with.  I love that they now have a smaller less expensive portion of the mac and cheese which I still found to be quite a bit of food!  I've enjoyed drinks and other entrees at a Yard House back home in Northern California and I think it's safe to say that their food is consistently good from one location to the next.  I definitely enjoyed my meal here and our server made the experience that much better!",

The food was amazing the flavor of the lamb burger was so moist. I ordered a salad but they forgot it. Once it came I can say it was worth the wait. It was fresh honestly the best house salad I ever had. Great selection of beers. Enjoyed the amazing hefier weizen. Next time I'll go and enjoy the large bar and just chow down on appetizers.",

    "text": "I've enjoyed Yardhouse in the past, however, my most recent encounter with one of the managers, Leo, has really affected my overall experience and opinion of this restaurant.   Leo informed my group of friends sitting at the bar that one of my friends would have to leave if she couldn't sit still. It was her birthday and I will be the first to admit she was slightly intoxicated... I would understand if my friend spilled a drink, broke a glass, screamed obnoxiously, or literally fell over in her chair which she did not. She. Did. Nothing.  My friend was a little tipsy and the manager was quick to judge. I understand that if someone at a bar seems intoxicated it is a liability issue, however, I feel there could have been more professional and polite verbiage used to relay that message. This was not the the case.   Leo was cold and came off rude. The group I was with were all surprised and shocked because as I said earlier, the friend we were with by no means was acting obnoxious or creating a scene. I asked for the man's name who happened to be the manager and he told me it was Leo. He also tried to grab his business card and realized he didn't have one with him. He didn't offer to retrieve one for me either.  ... I get it. Working in the restaurant industry I know there are a lot of difficult and intoxicated guests to deal with (I've been a server back in the day myself) however, there is also a thing called empathy and delivery which goes a long way. I don't work in the restaurant industry anymore but I do work in guest service management. The manager could have asked politely what he would have liked to occur, but that didn't happen. I hope Yardhouse management improves because I actually really liked that place. My interaction with Leo really bothered me (still does).   Mitch, a bartender working at the time tried to defend Leo and didn't show empathy as well. He event spelt his name out for me because he was very confident in defending why I was wrong to feel offended with my interaction with Leo. Not sure if Mitch understands what the interaction consisted of. He sure was quick to make me feel like I was in the wrong.  Unfortunately this recent experience has really affected my overall experience with Yardhouse. I will not be recommending anyone to this restaurant nor I will be returning. Being a large chain as they are I hope they improve in customer service to retain some loyal business.",

    "text": "First time at Yard House, but I had heard a lot about it from friends.  Pros:  1. The food was great and came out in a timely manner. 2. Amazing drinks selection. If beer is your thing head on over. 3. Servers are friendly and attentive.  4. Ambience is perfect for a night out with friends or a casual first date.  5. Bathrooms are clean with roughly 5 stalls so there wasn't really a line for the ladies. (Important for me)  Cons: 1. Each server has their own table and if you need something you have to look for your server. My husband and I had our hand up for a good 5 minutes and heard other servers ask each other who our server was before finally heading over to ask what we would like. I understand why they did this but all we wanted was some hot sauce...haha  2. Their menu has such variety it threw me off a little. I like consistency because it means they specialize in certain foods. And it's easier to choose.  What we had: Fried mac&cheese (was not in love with it) Truffle oil fries (loved it) Mediterranean Salmon (loved it) Korean BBQ tacos (husband liked it) Dessert trio sampler (chocolate souffle was the best)",

Also love the poke stack, nachos, pizzas, calamari from the happy hour menu (that's all I've tried but I'm sure I'll love more).  Went here for dinner tonight with one of my girlfriends and as appetizer we had the deep fried Brussel sprouts that has crispy potato wedges and a savory sauce underneath everything... Wow this is the best best best dish I've tried by far at yard house. You must try it!  Entree I got the chicken penne pasta, which was creamy goodness with chunks of chicken, asparagus and sun dried tomatoes, which really gave it a kick! My girlfriend ordered the ahi tuna crunch salad which was also very good, seared ahi tuna on top of salads tossed with wonton crunch and sesame sauce... Very good.   You can choose from small to large portion, we both chose small and with an appetizer it really filled us up :)",

Sarah was our hostess. She was excellent she kept our drinks flowing and was always insight. Very polite and upbeat attitude. She always carried a smile on her face. My friends asked her to take pictures for us of us and she happily did so even with one hand being she had plates in the other   This was on a Tuesday night and the place was packed. I can just imagine on a weekend how this place turns out. I'll stick to a weekday anytime. It's located at the Townsquare mall right off the strip. Very nice location and not hard to find. Very clean and tvs all over. Although you really don't pay attention to the screen with a big party involved like tonight. But it's nice to know you have options.   They have a huge menu. From a long list of appetizers to a full on entree menu. Food for the whole family to enjoy. Lots of drinks as well. Kids are welcome. The prices are....about right for the quantity and quality of food you receive. Parking is free and relatively close to the restaurant. I'd definitely come back and enjoy this experience again.",

Why would I want to eat bar food? I was wrong because the food is good, not just average bar food.  The lunch specials are very tasty and accommodate a lunch hour at a reasonable price. My favorite combination is the 1/2 Roast Beef Dip with a salad. Diet splurge meets healthy. My favorite appetizers are the Onion Rings and Chicken Nachos. When we come here for work dinners the Mac & Cheese with truffle oil is a favorite for several of my coworkers. The burgers are also really good, loaded with toppings and very juicy.  The menu is huge and has something to accommodate all tastes. Great spot to take a picky friend. This is obviously a great spot for beer lovers since they have so many beers on tap.  This particular location has a lot of outdoor seating which is a great option on a nice day. The patio is in the center of the shopping center for plenty of people watching entertainment.",

It's a challenge I'd gladly accept.  Well not the transplant!  I've been here for both the evening happy hour and the late night happy hour and have had an excellent time.  The chicken nachos are so big they're a meal all to their own.  The chicken lettuce wraps are good and the Asian chicken salad is delicious and the flat bread to die for.  But the real reason I come here is beer.  So many great beers on tap.  I love Rouge Hazel Nut Brown!   It always tastes like another!  Super friendly bar tenders are waiting and willing to serve you up a plethora of suds that will satisfy even the most thirsty of beer drinkers.  It's no doubt why the bar is always full. However it doesn't matter if you sit at the bar or sit at one of their outdoor tables the service is always fast and the food is tasty.  I recommend checking them out the next time you're at Town Square.",

I ordered the rice bowl which was undersized as a dinner entree.  Another in my party ordered the ribs which was a huge pile of food.    We sat outdoors on the heated patio that really could use a few more heaters.  Out table was between two units and it was a bit too chilly with the breeze in this particular evening.   I would add more heaters with the option of throttling them back than not having enough.     Beer on tap was a bit pricey for a brew house but there is a wide selection to choose from.    I am pretty non-committal about a return visit to this place.   There was nothing memorable about it in a town full of memorable eateries.",

Came here for happy hour on a Wednesday night. First of all, food was great, like always. We ordered a pint of Heineken and a cocktail for drinks. For food, we got a onion rings, chicken wings, bbq chicken pizza, and mushroom lettuce wraps. Everything was tasty. The only reason Im giving them 2 stars.  However, that day was far by the worst service I've had. I'm not sure what the guy's name is, but I found him very rude. After we ordered, he didnt come by to check on us once. While we were still eating, he dropped a few to go boxes and the check without even asking if we even needed it or if we wanted dessert. We had like 6 slices of pizza , over half of the onion ring tower and a couple chicken wings left.  We felt so rushed. I would have understood if they were getting ready to close, but it wasn't even 11 yet. It seemed like he didnt want us to be there at all.   I honestly hope that will be the only awful experience I have here because the food is wonderful.",

    "text": "Gets two stars for the interior decor, the vibe and cool bar. Everything else, not a fan.   I ordered their buffalo cauliflower which was very good. I also ordered a chopped bbq salad minus the chicken and also a Bloody Mary. First dreadful mistake was the menu, giving us the description of drinks that we liked which contained Tito's vodka. Only to order said drinks and be told there is no more Tito's vodka. Then get the drinks and them taste like there is absolutely no alcohol at all in them. I'm convinced they forgot to add it or the waitress thought we said virgin Bloody Mary. My boyfriend wasn't happy with his drink either. The weakest ever and the Bloody Mary was way too salty. My chopped bbq salad came with a Bloody Mary vinegarette dressing that was pretty non-existent and bizarre in itself and I had to actually use the dipping sauce from my buffalo cauliflower on it to actually taste any real dressing or flavor. When I ordered the bbq chopped salad minus the chicken, the waitresses asked, \"So you're sure you don't want to add any protein to your salad?\" I've never had anyone ask that before lol. I wanted to tell her that clearly I was vegetarian but didn't feel like wasting time explaining that. Salad was terrible. It literally was chopped veggies with water on it. Worst I've ever had and I'm amazed someone could screw up a salad.   FOOD: Mine was not impressive but I can't say I wouldn't go back and try something different next time and maybe a different location.   AMBIANCE: Very chill, I call it \"Neo-Noir Lighting\" dark but appropriate and effective. Great for a first date.  SERVICE: Jury is still out on that one  DRESS CODE: Casual to dressy casual",

First off the music creates a vibe that transports one back in time and the hockey game on all over the place adds to it. Our server was great and explained that it was happy hour so we tried the four cheese pizza . And they were half off yeah.   The atmosphere that Yard House creates for the guest is very laid back and chilled. One almost feels over dressed since not in flip flops and shorts when you come in. The inside dining is great and all. But secondly, they offer outside dining and the use of heat lamps in the winter and shade awnings in the summer. They used to have a fire place that guests could dine by, but it's no longer here.   Thirdly, I tried the sunset margarita and I had three of them by the time the second margarita came it just seems that the alcohol gets a little stronger each time, but it's probably just me. We experienced desert with the try 3 plate. It featured creme brulee, Apple cobbler, and a chocolate mousse. They were all delectable.",

They put a sauce on their that i cant put my taste buds on but compliments the beef, cheese and pickle well. For $12 you get 4 sliders and french fries which is a pretty good deal I was full when I finished. Service was good and constantly checking on us and refilling our drinks. The patio is actually warmer outside than inside due to the heat lamps so the patio was enjoyable.",

We visited on a Saturday night, the place was PACKED. Still, the wait was only about 10 mins. Our server was great, super friendly and attentive. The food came out quick.

However, the location is also exceptionally loud and service on a recent visit was less than attentive, even with a large party and a reservation. Luckily they didn't tack on autograt. The prices also seemed higher at this location than others, and the food just wasn't quite as good as usual.  AHI TUNA SALAD: Protein portion was noticeably less than at the Red Rock casino location. CALAMARI: Portion size was good, breading wasn't too thick or too oily, and there was a good mix of whole pieces and rings. The dipping sauce was cold though. GRILLED CHEESE & TOMATO BISQUE: Pretty good but nearly $14 for sliced cheese, bread, and tomatoes, is a bit ridiculous. Unclear whether other sandwich/burger orders include a side. TACOS: $4 for various street tacos. They're street taco sized but not street taco priced and not very tasty either. Pass on the chicken, at least. POKE NACHOS: Probably your best option. Well priced, good portion, and fresh. I liked the seasonings used, wasn't as salty as I'd expected. Easily shareable, too.",

Whether here for a a special occasion, or just for good eats, you are sure to find something you like.   One of my favorites is the cheese curds. The sauce that comes with it, not so much, but the curds are as close as a Wisconsin cheese curd, that I've found in the desert. Their street tacos are delicious too. The food is always fresh and comes out nice and hot!   This is a great spot for happy hour as well. You have nice choices of what to order, and the menu is not skimpy like other happy hour menus around the valley. Drinks $2/$3/$4 off depending on what you order.   Service in here is always good! I love when I go to a restaurant and the server has a sense of humor. It always makes the experience better.",

They have a huge selection of HH food :D -Poke nachos ($8): raw ahi, with avocado, cilantro, green onions etc. This is so yummy! -Spinach cheese dip ($7): comes with crispy flatbread its so savory. -Onion ring tower ($5): love how huge the onion rings are! -Fried calamari ($7): the bomb, it's so crispy and appetizing. -BBQ chicken pizza ($7): my favorite out of all the pizzas; it's a thin crust pizza with red onion, cilantro, chicken and bbq sauce. -I'm really sad that they took out the california roll and spicy tuna roll off of HH. Those were my favorite entrees too :(  HH DRINKS 5/5: -$2 off beer, wine, and cocktails -I usually get a black and blue (blue moon + guiness stout) or black and velvet (stout + cider)  SERVICE 2/5: -I called in to tell them to book a reservation for 7 people and they confirmed. So when I got there, the hostess said \"I don't see your name, and we don't book reservations for less than 8 people.\" Well okayyy, I didn't know that, whoever talked to me on the phone should have told me. I was super annoyed, and as a former hostess, she could have handled it a different way instead of disregarding me. -Our server (can't remember name) was really rude about us asking questions about the beers they have. Anyways my boyfriend was inquiring about coffee beers and this server was basically getting annoyed and making us feel uncomfortable with all the questions. The servers should be open to have a conversation with us, we don't know what kinda of beers you guys have.",

They have a ton of great food options as well.     You can come here for many a different occasion from a huge group of people to a date.  I remember one year we came to do a holiday gift exchange with my co-workers, with no problem at all (and half of us didn't even eat or drink anything).  Just remember if you are bringing a date here, it can get a little loud.    I like to come for happy hour as the food is very discounted.  You can get a lot of different items that are all the same size and quality they would be outside of happy hour.    I've tried quite a few things on the menu but I do notice that I tend to get the same thing all the time.  Poke stack and ahi crunchy salad.  This salad is something I'd probably want on death row.  Must have it.  Sometimes I do find that my mixed drinks can be a little hit or miss but my favorite cocktail is a Moscow Mule and with their housemade ginger beer, you can't go wrong.",

I really enjoy the line of gardein vegetarian and vegan options they have.   Of course they have a great selection of craft beers on tap and bottled. Wine and spirits are of course available as well. For this visit I enjoyed a wonderful Belgian Trippel. Absolutely delicious and full of rich notes with a fantastic finish.  I chose the Orange gardein chickun and while its not what you'd call health food it was delicious. I was here to celebrate my birthday with my awesome Brother, amazing Sister in law and her lovely Mom so hey I can splurge right? The sauce wasn't too sweet though I'd like a bit more spice to it. The dish came with a large portion of rice and I ate the whole thing! It was that good. Enough sauce to soak into the rice a bit but not so much as to require some water wings for the gardein chickun pieces.   Service was attentive and let us do our thing which was nice. The restrooms are nice as well, clean and tidy. Given the chance I'd certainly not hesitate to come here again.",

My quinoa salad was HUGE and included rare items such as pomegranate, beets, pumpkin seeds, blueberries, feta, and a flavorful vinaigrette. Delicious!   If you enjoy beer, ask for a little sip of the ones you want to try. There are a TON of options. Enjoy!",

I had to take the top of the bun off just to see the chicken. Very disappointing. Out waitress  Crystal was great but that does not cut it.  I paid 13 dollars for a chicken nugget on a bun.  Manager was great but stop with the portion control and give me a chicken sandwich.  Would you give me a half of a burger on a bun .",

    "text": "This location $#!Ts on The LINQ location to be completely honest, it's like they're not even the same restaurant. Coworkers and I will drive from the strip to Townsquare because their standards are better, to the point that other location has cheapened their menu items presentation and ingredients. The service is better and the food is made, served, and presented better. They don't bring the ingredients I add on the side - which it's fine if it's on the side, but I appreciate when it is actually incorporated into the meal prep as that is what I intend to do anyway, it also tastes better this way. They refill my water without me having to ask, yet another acknowledgment The LINQ location lacks, as I've had to ask to have my water refilled nearly every time I've gone to that particular location. This location is also usually not flooded by tourists. It is usually busy but not sardine like crammed. The patio is refreshing, oh and there's free parking. I can enjoy YH for lunch, happy hour @3pm for drinks, with a wide range of beer and cocktails or at dinner time. I really do appreciate their wide variety of menu options, but preferably crave and enjoy their ahi tuna options most, which is why I go to YH so often. Really The LINQ location should have the Townsquare hell or even the red rock training crew teach them how it's done, especially for being in the strip, not the quality I'd imagine they'd want to leave guests / tourists with the impression of what YH is. Will continue coming to this location, no doubt.",

The food was great, but the service was reeally slow... We probably waited 20 minutes to get our drinks and we got to switch waitress twice.

We were quickly seated at a table and greeted about five minutes later by our server Seth, who brought out our hibiscus tea and water. He was efficient and friendly and made great menu recommendations. We don't eat much at one sitting so we went straight in and my sister ordered their classic cheese burger with fries and I ordered the shrimp bowl with rice. One thing I noticed was their drink selection was ENORMOUS. Drafts, cocktails, mixed drinks and margaritas you name it they know it. Looked like a great happy hour spot if only we could've came at 10 pm. But it was ok, once our food came out I was very happy with my choice as I love veggies with my food and this place did a rice bowl with veggies and shrimp PERFECTLY. Since we were pressed for time we did not stay long but overall satisfied with the experience, I recommend going for happy hour on the weekdays so your server isn't rushed because I got that vibe a few times from the look of the servers there. Would go for happy hour!",

    "text": "This is a review about their happy hour sliders.  The Skinny: okay burgers that have a poor patty to bun ratio and need more interesting toppings (3), service - long wait times, reasonable service (2.5), value: it's reasonable - not too expensive and within keeping with other happy hour specials in town.  We ordered a plate of bearnaise sauce sliders and classic sliders. Serving sizes are large - one plate comes with four sliders and a side of fries.  The sliders are served on a slightly sweet pan-styled bun. Overall, there is probably a little too much bun and not enough meat inside. The patties are well-seasoned, crisp however are a might on the dry side.   The classic came with some standard cheese and pickle - which was okay but would have been better if there was some lettuce or tomato on top. The bearnaise sliders come with some fried onions which really improved the flavour of the sliders and texture. The bearnaise sauce wasn't anything I needed to go back for however.  The skinny fries are okay when they're hot but once again suffer once they've sat out for too long. They are crisp but are a little on the thin cut fries side of things so it lacks some of the lovely mealiness inside.  Overall, not bad sliders, but nothing really special. The edge goes out to the bearnaise sliders by virtue of the fried onion topping.",

My mom was looking for a dress in Town Square, and we decided to lunch at Yard House.  Generally I am a difficult person to eat with because of my dietary restrictions, but thanks to Mitch my life was made easier.  Yard house, a veggie/vegan portion of the menu that has mock meat dishes.  This basicall means, you can can get most the items with meat on the menu, with veggie meat instead.    I had a grilled spicy chicken sandwich on sourdough, with fries.  It was good,  not huge (which is good), and it came with Fries...The yard house fries are so good, since they use truffle oil.  YAY!  At the time i ordered my server wasn't sure if everything was 100 percent vegan, without having to ask he went out of his way to make sure I was eating no animal products. (THANK YOU!).  Having a server check with out asking is amazing.  No one ever does it, and nothing spoils a meal like hidden animal bits.    I will come back here again, especially when I am with family or other meat eaters.  A great place for non adventurous eaters.",

It has truffle oil which is always a win with me.   The service is pretty good most of the time. The servers are pretty attentive even when being slammed during happy hour.   I went here for lunch the other day and they have decent lunch specials (around $7.95). I got the french onion soup paired with a crab cake hoagie which was pretty good.

I was sad to find no happy hour, but that was my bad for going so late. :[ This meant that I had to pay full price for my appetizers? I haven't done that in...well, ever.   Since I had to DD, I ordered a plate of fish and chips. I must admit, those were some pretty good fish and chips. It's not THE best I've ever had (check out my Mad Greek review for that), but it is definitely up there.    I was surprised to find out that their last call is at 1:45.  It reminded me of being in California.  I didn't think any place in Vegas had such an early last call, but since they close (what? they close?) at 2, it makes sense.    Despite us being there so late, I didn't feel rushed to leave.  I truly appreciate that because so many places are egging you to leave when it comes to the last 15 minutes of business hours.  Instead, they started to clean up around us, close up the bar, etc, but our waiter still came by to see if there was anything else we needed or wanted and even came by past last call just to double check we didn't want anything else.  Overall, I am down to go back. Hopefully, I'll make it for happy hour. :D",

It's a big menu but very few items are edible. Usually 80% of the time it comes cold and 50% of time improperly cooked. I do like their jambalaya when it's cooked ok and their buffalo boneless wing when they are not overcooked. I used to go there once a week but the raw shrimps on the jambalaya made it become once every 3 months, that was the last drop and we make sure we eat before we go there",

Ok, so we had a party of 14 (plus being a Saturday night at 7, we knew it would be busy), so one of our guests went at 6:15 to put in a name and wait for a table, which we were told would be about an hour wait. Well 7 rolls around and no table, so half of our party waits to leave their hotel, because...no table. Well we finally get seated at 7:45 (we tell our friends to come meet us). The server comes 5 minutes later to get drink orders, 5 minutes after that, the Manager Leo comes and asks us when the rest of our party will be there and we say shortly, and he then complains he can't have empty tables for long. Well unfortunately there is a movie theater upstairs (and Stars Wars opened yesterday, so Town Square is busy) so our friends have trouble finding a parking space. Well maybe after 10 more minutes, the Manager Leo comes back to our table and begins to actually yell at us about the empty table, and how they had it reserved at 6 and they held it for us...Which wasn't even for our group! So we tell him this and we tell him our friends are trying to park, but he continues to yell at us and say he needs the table because other people are waiting. We respond and say we had waited (just like everyone else) for over an hour and a half for our table and our friends will be there any minute. He storms off mumbling, and then of course our friends show up 30 seconds later. We did have an issue trying to get our check, and at one point, Manager Leo came over to the corner of the bar area and glared at our table for about 10 seconds and stormed off again. I have to say that I have NEVER seen or been treated that way by a \"manager\" and I think that the General Management need  to have a talk with him. I can't imagine what he's like any other Saturday night during dinner hours.",

    "text": "You'd be surprised how much is closed in Vegas on a weekday night as far as food options. Living here, it's amazing how few choices there really are for late night food. Luckily, reverse Happy Hour happens late at night, which is why on my most recent visit, I was here with Justin G. (6/18/14.)  I've been here before for dinner and this place is pricey. Happy Hour is definitely the way to go if you wanna try this place out. While I won't go over what I've had here before in detail, I will say that many of the entrees are quite bland.  Justin and I ordered a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, garlic noodles and chicken nachos. It was a HUGE amount of food and came out to $18.   Pizza - according to Justin, \"I feel like pizza is pizza. It's hard to get bad pizza anywhere.\"   Noodles - terrible. Would not get again. I asked them to not put tofu in the noodles, but didn't notice that the noodles were covered in edamame. These were not only covered in toxic legumes,  they were bland and had no garlic taste whatsoever. Skip for time and all eternity.   Nachos - good. Too many beans. Would definitely order sans beans (uggggh) and would have been better with hot sauce.  Place is very loud and very busy. At 10:30 PM, there was a line to get in to be seated. That either speaks to how good this place is or how few options are in Vegas on a late Wednesday night for food.  Edited to add: They do not have good Ranch. They need to get their dressing game on lock because it is shameful.",

    "text": "The presentation and taste of the food is excellent, but the service you'll receive on a busy weekend night might not be worth your hard earned money.   I was with a group of friends deciding where we would eat and have some drinks when one said, \"If the restaurant isn't busy, I don't want to go in there because it probably doesn't have good food.\" Sometimes, however, a place can be too busy to provide exceptional service. That was my experience at Yard House this past Saturday night.  We sat down at a booth and order drinks, appetizers, and entrees. Our drinks took about 20 minutes to arrive, they don't come in chilled glassware, and the tap isn't cold - so your drink is warm after three-four sips.   Our appetizers arrived with our entrees. The bowls/plates are large and with five people in a booth, we didn't have table space for the food. We were eating on top of one another. Since we ordered appetizer soups and entree sized salads instead of finger food - this wasn't cool! Armando blamed this on the kitchen, so my guess is they don't fire entrees separately from appetizers. Some restaurants fire appetizers and then check on the table's progress before firing the entrees. My recommendation on a busy day at Yard House would be to place your appetizer order, wait 15 minutes, and then order your entree.  We had a sixth person join us after our food arrived and her drink arrived just about the time we were all done eating. Overall, the experience was nothing special. I generally order appetizers for one reason, to offset the hunger and pace the food so you can enjoy the company your with and experience the meal.  Outside of the service complaints, the Chicken Tortilla Soup was very good. It has a creamy white cheddar flavor with slices of avocado and tortilla strips in addition to a nice portion of chicken. The bowl of soup is not a large generous portion, so it could easily be an appetizer.   The entree portion of the Chopped Salad w/ salmon was fresh looking and generously portioned. It comes with the typical tomatoes, bacon, and avocados in addition to corn, cucumbers, celery, onion and cilantro.  For dessert, we decided to try the Mini Peach Apple Cobbler and the S'Mores Brownie. All three bits of crust topped cobbler were delicious. The S'Mores brownie required a topping of ice-cream, ordered afterward, because it is too dry to eat.",

    "text": "Yardhouse is really not all it is cut out to be. I took my best friend to lunch for his birthday. We ordered the lobster garlic noodles (meh!), orange chicken, and two beers. My bill was $98.00 for the two of us! The lobster noodles were nothing special; in fact, the dish was not good. To be fair, there was a generous portion of seafood in the dish. But for the amount of delicious seafood - it lacked a lot of flavor. I was very disappointed in the dish; which my waitress suggested to be her favorite. My best friend ordered the orange chicken. And by his constant comments on how we should have just went to Panda Express across the way, I can only judge that he didn't think it was very great either. We were both let down by our food and overall experience (like waiting 15 minutes for a water refill AFTER we asked for one). All in all, maybe I will give this place a second chance for happy hour when I have the opportunity to spend less money on lackluster food; but I doubt it.",

I ordered the porchini Halibut with bok choy, asparagus, and mashed potatoes. This was ridiculously delicious, everything was flavorful and cooked perfectly. I also go a Moscow mule, and it was nice and strong.  I will definitely come back to try more of their dishes.",

    "text": "I only go to YARDHOUSE for happy hour... and that's because I believe they have the best menu (including price, options & booze) in Vegas for happy hour! I love going here with a friend or even a big group! They have over 30 different types of beer on tab and an array of wines and other liquor. They are known for there yard sized drinks of your choice in a fun and hip glass! The ambiance is very relaxing and chill. Service is great and the bartenders are funny, too! Okay.. onto to the food that I've tried!  Happy hour food: Hawaiian Poke Stack- Ahi tuna on top of friend wonton chips with avocado, ginger, carrots and their sauce.. amazing! must try! one of my favorite items on the HH menu.  Fried calamari- I love calamari.. I love drizzling lemon juice on top and dipping it in the sauces. It tastes like every other fried calamari.. nothing special but still so good.  Kung Pao calamari- came with rice on the side, Kung Pao sauce with the calamari and it was mixed with red bell peppers, carrots, and caramized walnuts. Very different, a little spicy, but very tasty!  Bernaise sliders- you have an option to upgrade fries for a dollar! I upgraded my fries for truffle fries and they were amazing (I'm a sucker for truffle fries)! The sliders tasted like regular sliders.. nothing too special. I will definitely try other stuff next time!  Chicken lettuce wraps- came with four different type of sauces and the chicken came inside a taco-shell like bowl. I love making wraps, but it was okay. The chicken was okay. Is it me or they never give enough lettuce? Hehehe  Drinks- Great selection for a cheap price!  Overall, this place is fun for happy hour food, drinks and fun with friends! I wish the Linq had happy hour menu!",

We got seated, drinks were ordered and then around 5:30pm we ordered food (Pizza and boneless wings on the happy hour menu). To our disadvantage, the kitchen was backed up. We started noticing that tables who arrived after us were receiving their food before us. Our waitress, Nancy, was very apologetic and doing her best to fix the problem. After 45 mins, we asked to speak to the manager. Jose, the manager, came over and spoke with us. He apologized and explained that the kitchen was backed up and offered to cover the bill. Our food came out one by one but fresh and hot. ALL THE FOOD ENDED UP BEING ABSOLUTELY DELICIOUS!!!! We really enjoyed all the flavor. We even decided to get dessert! We enjoyed ourselves as we ate and enjoyed our last day together as a group. Our wonderful waitress came by frequently to check on us and refill our drinks. The manager also stopped by to check on us.  Even though we had a dilemma with the timing of our food, the customer service was great. I would definitely still return. I can't believe I've been to town square so many times and never stopped here. I can't wait to come back.",

When he went on break he brought in Blair and introduced her...I thought that was very nice. She was awesome as well giving is more suggestions for our second round of drinks.   We ordered cocktails from their special menu in honor of the World Cup...they were yummy and strong! Our appetizer was the Hawaiian poke stack. I could eat this for days! Ahi tuna with carrot and dikon over flat fried wontons with an avacado and a very flavorful sauce on top. It was great.  We decided to get a pizza which we never get except from a pizza place. The BBQ chicken with onion, cilantro and tangy sauce was what we ordered. Overall the taste was on point. I wish I had ordered more sauce to go on top!

I ordered the pepper crusted gorgonzola burger. The marsala mushrooms and bleu cheese went really well with the arugula. A slight twist on your typical bleu cheese mushroom burger but the change actually means something instead of just having fancier ingredients for fanciness's sake. The patty was perfectly medium rare, tender and juicy. YUM. The beef was gamey, almost like buffalo, but I liked the change of pace. However, I do wish the fries were cut thicker though.  Almost forgot, they had perfectly fried onion rings! Excellent texture, crunch, and flavor. Plus they come out on a tower, kinda like those kiddie ring tosses. Good stuff.

I have fond memories of many of their locations (Costa Mesa, Irvine, Long Beach and West Palm Beach) and it was always with a crowd, so this is one of those chain places where good times are guaranteed.    We went for happy hour since the appetizers were half priced and pints were 3.25.  The beer selection is HUGE and my companion and I had a hard time in choosing something to start with.  One of the two servers taking care of our table suggested we get a \"pre-designed\" sampler.  This is when the bar selects six beers for you, rather than you choosing six, and they stay within a certain medium, such as pale ales, darks, etc.  We wanted something in the medium category.    The sampler is something I totally recommend you do if you're undecided about what beer you'd like and you have someone to share with you.  We sipped each beer, rated them accordingly, and decided our top three, in order, were Redhook ESB, Redhook Blond, and Fat Tire's New Belgium.  Since the top two were the New Belgium and the Blond, we ordered pints of each and shared 'em.  As for the appetizers, we picked up an order of the fried chicken strips and Hawaiian poke stack.  Great choices (kinda hard to mess up chicken strips, though); the poke was a pretty good portion for an appetizer and was tasty!    Both of the servers were outstanding in tending to our party of 14.  Very attentive, didn't miss a beat, and were great about reminding everyone to get their last orders in before happy hour ended.  Can't beat that!  If only the Yard House were in the DMV.....",

    "text": "Pros: * Delicious food. You have to try the chicken tortilla soup. * Friendly staff. * Modern menu and decor.  Cons: * Expensive. The food while good is slightly too expensive. * Due to the popularity, they're generally crowded with long waits.  I believe Town Square to be the best shopping and restaurant plaza in Las Vegas. The quantity of choices for either is only matched by the quality. There certainly is no shortage of great food at Town Square and on yelp, Yard House is rated best of them all. I haven't tried them all but I can definitely say Yard House is the best I've had yet.  I went with a group of four on a late Tuesday afternoon. They weren't busy or crowded but I have seen the line pour out the door enough times to know I was lucky. We were promptly sat down just time to enjoy the happy hour menu. We ordered their famous tower of onion rings while we sifted through the massive menu. I ordered the chicken salad with a cup of tomato bisque soup. The other members of my party ordered the barbeque chicken salad with a cup of chicken tortilla soup, pastrami sandwich, and a mushroom burger.   When the onion ring tower arrived it instantly lived up to the expectations. Thin, lightly battered, crispy onion rings sprinkled with parmesan cheese and served with ranch and chipotle ranch. They bursted with flavor to die for. At first the tower seems so incredibly large but when you finish the memory feels small in hindsight. My soup and salad was good with a pleasant, creamy, rich ranch dressing and well-seasoned tomato bisque soup. However, it paled in comparison to the nothing short of perfect, chicken tortilla soup. I have never had a tortilla soup so creamy and flavorful. They put a large piece of avocado in the cup along with the crispy tortilla strips and large chunks of chicken. Together, they blend to create a truly wonderful and hearty cup of soup. I had a bite of the barbeque chicken salad and while it was a bit too saucy for my tastes, the barbeque dressing wasn't overpowering and went well with the large pile of onion strings atop the salad. The pastrami sandwich looked great and the burger looked even better. The burger bun instantly caught my eye with a smooth crisp surface devoid of any grease or sheen. Next time I will surely try a burger.   The Town Square location is large and wide open. The lighting is dim and creates a hip vibe that went well with the modern menu. Everyone in my group had a few questions about the menu and the server was friendly, knowledgeable, and willing to help. The prices however are a bit steep and you might want to arrive early to take advantage of the happy hour choices. One specific item that caught my eye was the 17 dollar macaroni and cheese. It looked delicious but it would have to be at that price.  In the end I walked away satisfied and yearning to return to try a burger or maybe even that posh mac and cheese entree.",

TVs everywhere, helpful staff...Really really good Diet Coke!  All I remember was the sheer embarrassment of being the only person wearing a sparkly gold dress and a friggin bridal veil, only in Vegas...except we're not on the Strip, so now I'm totally self-conscious about a restaurant full of people staring at me...though not embarrassed of rolling deep with 14 hot girlfriends wearing tight black clothing.  Taxi service is slow at this venue, especially on a Saturday.  Doesn't really matter because you're in Vegas and after you're done, the rest of it just kind of fades to black, don't judge me...you know what I'm talking about.",

The salmon was also very good as well as the jambalaya.  But the thing that stood out the most about this place was when the waiter asked me if he wanted to change a channel to my team! There are so many TVs in tune to the sports. I was so happy about that!",

We had a guest in town with a gluten allergy and found that they advertise a GF menu. Excited to find some place to take our guests, the menu and excitement quickly faded. Their GF menu lists a burger (and sandwiches), but it wasn't really a burger. It was just the patty with a side of lettuce, tomatoes, onion and pickle. That's not a burger, then fries were not an option (oil is used to cook battered onion rings, chicken, etc). So burger and fries, became a patty and salad. Why bother with a special GF menu? You can order the same way off the regular menu, by skipping the fries and say no bun. Other non-GF plates ordered were pretty basic. Wouldn't go out of my way to go back here, especially if our food allergy guest comes back. If you have a gluten allergy, skip this place and go to the Chesesecake Factory in Henderson and get a real burger with the bun and fries...all GF.",

The late happy hour starts at 10pm so we opted to drink until 10pm and then put in our happy hour order. Yard House has a fabulous happy hour with a variety of options for drinks and food. So worth it to check out the happy hour here. There is a regular happy hour and then a late happy hour. We were ecstatic to catch the late happy hour. Prices for apps are almost half off.  Our server was Jordan. He had an awesome sense of humor because I made a comment about his name and said, \"Jordan like NKOTB Jordan?\" He laughed and said, \"Why NKOTB? I prefer Jordan like Michael Jordan!\" Good save. He was friendly, accommodating, and funny.   My friend noted they had Lindeman's Framboise which is one of my favorites!!! So I asked the server to do half Framboise and half Hoegaarden beer. Trust me, it's a pretty perfect balance without too much sweetness of the Framboise. We call this drink a Dirty Ho on the east coast, Yard House calls it a Rose Garden.   Always always always get the Poke Nachos here. I dream about this stuff. I'm so obsessed actually that after the first two times I had it, I just had to recreate the dish at home. It's that good! And happy hour price is even better.  We also got the BBQ Chicken Pizza which was solid. The Vampire Taco was good but only took a bite because we were all so full. The mini sliders were tasty and juicy. Love the string fries, it's the perfect size to munch on. Our friends got wings which wasn't special but still consistent and good.   Downside to this particular visit was the air conditioning was down and it was warm as hell. Might as well have sat outside because you at least get fans out there. But everything was still good and our server Jordan rocked so it was all good.",

We had our beers poured. I had the ACE PINEAPPLE cider. Really crisp and refreshing. My buddies ordered two burgers and I got the Mac and cheese. Biggest regret right there. My gut told me burger but I was craving something different. The description said chicken and bacon in it. Well if you count three tiny cut up pieces of bacon as an addition to a dish.... There was more bacon on my deviled eggs than my whole Mac and cheese bowl..... The noodles were crunchy and undercooked. The Mac and cheese sauce was dry and wasn't creamy. Kinda just molded to the undercooked pasta.   I did the universal sign of pushing my plate forward to hint to the bartender that it wasn't good. Well see that's the problem. With so many bartenders on we didn't know who was serving us. I swear we had 5 different people taking care of us....yet no one noticed a full plate of food pushed forward. Did not appreciate not knowing who was taking care of us.   The only way we got a managers attention (assume the managers wear white) was that my buddy literally screamed HELP! to gain some attention. That's sad. She came over and asked what was wrong and I told her and she offered me something else. Honestly with ticket times and the fact my two buddies were done eating I just wanted to leave. I feel stupid bringing them here especially because they were here for only one night :(  The check said Beatriz on it but again really didn't know who was helping me. I prob will never come back to this location. It is not a good representation of the brand.  On a positive note I was pleased with how whoever took my order was very serious about my tomato allergy. That was nice. Also the deviled eggs were good. Nothing special just a good tasting pre snack. The host was very sweet and polite on my way in.",

Slow day today so noise wasn't an issue- place is MASSIVE! Got two tacos- they looked light on the portion but the taste was good. Chips were super fresh. Just stopped in for an app and a beer- customer service was great. We'll come back for happy hour food!",

Tonight we came and had an aggravating experience, after ordering two beers and an appetizer our server Taylor Y asked us if we would like to wait until happy hour to put our ordered items in, happy hour starts at 10 and she asked us this at 9:59? Of course we said sure! After ordering at 9:59 by 10:10 we still didn't have our beers, or water, our server swung by and said \"your beers will be on the way soon\" we were very confused because inside tables were empty, the only thing busy was the bar, so at 10:13 I went to the service bartender and told her that I knew it wasn't her fault but our beers were ordered about 15 minutes ago and we're just checking on them, the service bartender pointed them out Sitting and said she'll have somebody bring them over, finally 2 minutes after checking we got them! However we still had to ask for waters, sat with empty beers after our first round, and waited about 10 min for our second round, our server was a very nice person however she was not able to anticipate our needs to give us a great experience! We ordered 4 beers total, and 2 appetizers and we sat there for over an hour and twenty minutes before deciding that ordering anything else would take too long :(",

I was looking at the menu previously and said t think I would find something I like but that was it and it was a good price for the portion too!   I'd say the biggest downfall was the music, it was too loud. I couldn't hear my sis in law who was sitting right across from me and it wasn't just me, my mom could barely hear her as well.

This place has an extensive beer selection - I tried one (the rose something... which I didn't really care for, but I still will have to come back to try some of their other offerings).  Food was, for the most part, really good.  Our large group had a variety of dishes for lunch and they were all pretty tasty, not to mention huge.  We shared a couple of desserts as well.  They were ok, but in my view not worth writing home about.",

I've had their upper manhattan's at 2 other locations and they are, in my opinion, one of the BEST drinks I've ever had (San Diego and Summerlin locations). I've always enjoyed the food at Yard House and usually love the drinks. From now on, I'll stick with the Summerlin location.  I suppose if you are a beer person, this is the place for you.

However, Tim took the order of the table next to us within minutes of them sitting down. He checked on them multiple times during their meal. He didn't check on us once. Even something small, asking if we needed anything else, would have been appreciated. Instead, we had to flag down other servers and ask for our check and more water.

The chicken nachos are big enough to definitely share with a few people, and the shushimi is very good, as well. We've tried the burgers ( I like the turkey burger a lot), the street tacos are excellent, pasta dishes look good (although I haven't tried any yet) and the pan seared ahi and ginger salmon are tasty. There's a good kids menu, lots of beers to play around with, full bar. Service has always been excellent and the atmosphere can be loud, but it's casual, too. We have eaten inside, but prefer outside.  It's moderately priced for that type of restaurant, typically for our family of 4 the bill is $80-100, that's dinners with a beer or a cocktail.",

    "text": "Yard House is one of my favorite places to eat, drink, and relax.  The front desk and servers are always nice and friendly and provides excellent customer service which is as equally important than the food and drinks.  As a manager in the service industry, I take pride in not only ensuring my customers are treated well, but also my employees.  We are all human and make mistakes and as a manager I know I have the responsibility to hold my personnel accountable, but there is a time and a place to do so and in front of customers in never the time nor the place.  While dining, one of the managers was reprimanding one of the front desk persons for something done incorrectly.  I get that businesses strive for perfection but that incident was inappropriate and unprofessional.  I love coming to the Yard House and enjoy going to this location but if this ever occurs again when I am there I will take the time to go to the other one in Red Rock.  Please make sure this doesn't happen again and let me give you all the extra two stars!",

They were pretty busy so we had about a 45 minute wait time to get seated. We took a quick stroll around the area and when we returned we got seated shortly thereafter. We were quickly greeted by our server who was knowledgeable about the menu. We placed our drink order and began looking over the vast choices in the menu. We then placed our order and received our food about 30 minutes later which was surprising given the amount of people there. The food was excellent and really hit the spot. I would have loved for the prices to be a little lower but overall I think it was worth it do to the customer service our waiter gave us.",

The prices seem identical to other Yardhouses in the area and the atmosphere seems the same.  I do have one main complaint. My last time I was served here.My waiter seemed confused as to what I was saying as if I had a hearing problem. I asked for pepper for my chicken soup, and he thought I said the opposite.  He then promptly walked away without me having the chance to correct him. He never truly took the time to ensure our orders were correct. For instance, we were brought the wrong beer and had to have another server fix the mistake.  Unfortunately, I do not recall his name, but he was a young tall man with long hair.   Although I just ranted about service, you must know that the food is incredible. I love the pork belly tacos, the crab cakes, and Thai chicken pizza. I'll always come back here for a good happy hour special.",

We decided to come for lunch and since the weather was beautiful we decided to sit outside. I have NO IDEA why YardHouse does this but they sit people when their servers are at lunch. The logic makes NO SENSE to me because how is there supposed to be service at a table when the server assigned to it is off the clock. Right? I'm not sure either. This happened last time and it happened again. Thankfully the server wasn't on lunch for a godly amount of time and we were actually able to get our order in in a timely manner.  The food seems really consistent location to location and you can't get me away from their french fries or  BBQ Ranch chicken salad but seating your customers in an area that won't get any service needs to change. Until then, this place is still just \"ok\"",

    "text": "Came here for dinner last night. Overall experience was poor... at best. I've been here for lunch once before, it was fine. Came here for dinner with somebody who was in town and the music was just pumping. It was super loud.  It was fairly early in the evening, around 5pm, when we arrived and there were a lot of people in the restaurant, mostly families and people just trying to have a conversation over dinner. I asked the waitress if there's any possibility of turning the music down slightly as it was almost impossible to have a conversation in the restaurant and she indicated that they would not do that. That was their music level and that's where it was going to stay. She wasn't rude about it, but certainly as you looked around the restaurant most people were having the exact same problem. I understand if it was a later crowd and maybe more of a bar crowd but this was absolutely families and people having dinner.    The second issue was the service. Food came out at a relatively reasonable pace however they forgot my French fries to go with my sliders, another member of our party ordered chicken fingers and they were way, way over cooked. They really didn't seem to care whether they were overcooked or not and nobody really ever came back to check on us. So my two star review is because it wasn't exactly consumer-friendly, service wasn't great, and anybody could have, should have, noticed that the food wasn't prepared properly. French fries are pretty standard item on some of these menu items and over cooking something as simple as chicken fingers.... I doubt I'll be back.",

    "text": "So many beers so little tolerance. Yard House has a phenominal number of beers to sample on any given night including some local brews as from Sin City Brewery (my fav 7 years running) and Tenaya Creek. I ordered an Anderson Valley Boont Amber from NorCal before I saw the Sin City beers. No worries though. The hops in this California style amber went well with my dinner. I ordered a black truffle chesse burger. Freshly grilled and topped with gooey truffle cheese and onion bacon jam, this burger was some rich pub fare. The bitter hop notes of the beer cut through that richness. My only complaint was the size of the burger. I think I can get a bigger burger at Carl's Jr but it wouldn't taste so good. Luckily there were enough fries to make up the difference. Lovely little shoestrings that took to ketchup real well.   Other fare ordered on this particular night were average fish and chips with the unique jalapeno tartar sauce and garlic aioli, a roast beef sandwich and jambalaya with pasta in place of rice. I tried the fish and a bite of sausage from the jambalaya. My favorite part of any of it was the garlic aioli for the fish but that stuff would be good on just about anything.  It was very loud in Yard House.  The music was loud which is fine by me especially given the classic rock sounds they were pumping out but it was difficult to hear my family over the sound of music. Not to mention the place was packed so we were talking over the couple hundred other people in there too. Despite the noise, the food was good and service was adequate. I will be back.",

Patience run thin here today. Which I don't understand, because it's usually my favorite Yardhouse location to come to in town...  Came in 10 before 3 (it's 4:10 as I'm writing this) as I'm writing about this, for reference and it wasn't busy for it being the start of happy hour. I get sat quickly enough, but my server doesn't come to even take a drink order for 10 minutes. Ok, whatever. No big deal.  When she arrives, I ask for a Grey Goose martini extra dirty and water. The water arrives and so does my meal, a small ahi crunch salad, but no martini. I watched it get made at the bar from my booth and sit at the bar while my server grabbed other drinks for her tray (maybe there wasn't enough room?), walk between the server's POS station and the host stand, take the order of the table next to me, AND serve their drinks. In the midst of all of that, I stopped another server to say that I think that drink at the bar is mine and she told me she'd inform my server.... my server comes back to apologize for the wait and she's just waiting on the bartender to actually make it to bring to me... walks over, picks up the SAME martinis and brings it to me. And it was extra dry, not extra dirty. Go figure.  But wait! There's more!  I ask another passerby server if I can send it back and have it remade, and they again informed my server who came to ask what was wrong with my order and I explained politely but ended up not wanting a drink at all. I asked for my food menu back in the interest of ordering sliders to go and that took another 15 minutes so I decided against another food order and requested the check, which has just been presented to me. It's another table's check, for a bunch of happy hour cocktails and fries, etc... remember how I said I only had a small ahi salad? I deducted another star by the end of this review.",

    "text": "Yard house is pretty awesome especially when your there with awesome company.  I've been here a bunch of times and always have a blast.  If you're here you're going to be most likely getting one of those long glasses filled with beer, I always thought they were yard long glasses, hence the name Yard House, but I think they're half yards now. They have a great selection of domestic, imports, and craft beers.  They also have a special selection of beer which they'll serve until they run out.  I'd recommend trying those first if they sound good to you.  Happy Hours: Monday - Friday 3pm - 6pm, half off those drinks, apps, and pizzas, there's also specials on some drinks. Sunday - Wednesday 10pm - Close, same as M-F except no half off those long drinks.  If you can try to get a sit outside because inside is usually pretty loud and you might get your drinks faster, the bar is usually crowded.  It's also easier to get a party of about 20 seated together.  I think we had about that many last time, some passing out, everyone a drunken mess, good times. They have heaters during the winter and when it gets warmer nice place to have a beer away from the A/C.  Their food is actually pretty good better that what you'd expect from a place that serves mass amounts of alcohol.  They have everything from burgers to seafood to pizza, pasta, ribs, desserts...  Service is usually most of the time, haven't had a problem yet except for the time I asked for a yard a crown and they said no jk.  I'd say the only problem about this place is that when it's crowded, every time I've been there, it gets difficult getting a beer at the bar. Overall I'd always go back.",

    "text": "I have been a fan of Yard House ever since it opened here at Town Square, especially during Happy Hour where we can take advantage of the special deals on appetizers and drinks. It's a great way to find out what we like so we can share suggestions when take our out town guests here for dinner.   Dining here has always been pretty good as far as food and service goes. Except for my last visit here.  I had ordered Chicken Nachos appetizer and mistake on my part, I didn't realized it's served with Guacamole which I am highly allergic to and get real bad food reactions from it. I was going to work my way around the nacho plate but our server was really nice and said he would have it remade, no problem, only it would take a few minutes more.    Few minutes later I had a dish of Chicken Nachos! Looked great and it did for the most part tasted pretty good. Only thing is it was the same plate of nachos with the one layer of guac just scraped off the plate.  There were still even traces of guac still left on the chips and smudges of guac on plate!  (see pic: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yard-house-las-vegas?select=j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg#j_re5zvpe5Qh7zwBXkpMyg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yard...</a>  ) I didn't really want to have this plate taken back yet again.   Needless to say I was really disappointed I didn't touch the plate after I saw there was still guacamole on it.  It's no fault of the server. Rest of our orders were pretty good.  But the cook line needs to know that food allergies should be taken seriously. Had I ate anything that even had a smidgen of guacamole, you would've had your guest knocked out on your table.",

It seems like the Vegas douchebags and  whores like to pre-game at Yard House before they go to Blue Martini. It's filled with drunk college kids and people who get sloppy. The service is terrible on the weekends at the bar, you almost have to throw something at a bartender to get service. The food is great though. Honestly, I have never had a bad plate of food from there. It is a little pricey for a bar I will say. They have a huge list of beer available on tap and it can be a nice place to go to if you don't go at the already pre-specified times by another reviewer. It's basically a less fancy pick up bar on the weekends for college kids. If you want to get loud and rowdy, this is the place to go on Friday and Saturday. If you want some great food for dinner before a movie that's not on the weekends, this is your place.",

Someone in our party sent her burger back not once, but twice, because it was RAW in the middle (no exaggeration...it was cool, gummy, blood red-- not medium, as ordered.) Our server, Barry, was unsympathetic, unacommodating, and wholly unprofessional. His careless, lackadaisical attitude was off-putting and detracted from our experience at Yard House. Who cares how many beers are on tap if your server is a douchey loser, angry at the world? He literally said to my table of 5: \"You all are nothing but numbers to me. That's how I roll.\" A manager granted us a free dessert for our troubles and extraordinarily long wait time for food that was uncooked. Baffling. The Yard House is dead to us.",

    "text": "I'm really not sure why I haven't reviewed the Yardhouse yet (being that I'm there all the time anyway) but I figure I chime in and give the Yelpers yet another review of an awesome eatery/bar.  I pretty much love this place.  The atmosphere is great, the music is usually pretty jammin (albeit someone has the top 40 hits on rotation nowadays and I'd definitely rather have the classic rock they usually throw on), and I always seem to run into someone I know.  Now, I'm usually not an advocate for chain restaurants but the Yardhouse has it's own uniqueness to pride itself on.  What exactly am I talking about you ask?  THE BEERS: the main reason why I commute well across town to Town Square.  The Yardhouse, aside from the Freakin' Frog on Maryland Pkwy, has the most impressive variety of beers available that I have ever seen.  They have all kinds of different types of beer for every type of palate and for 3.50 domestics and 4.50 goblets/specialty beer mixes during happy hour, that is definitely hard to beat.  I did mention happy hour and I will also mention that happy hour is the best time to go (10 to close Sun-Wed and I'm not sure of the mid-day happy hour but I know there is one).  Select appetizers are half off during happy hour and they even have well drink specials for the spirit and hard liquor lovers out there.  All in all, I must say that the Yardhouse is one of my favorite hangouts and they usually never cease to impress.  I say usually because they did get rid of one of my favorite beers (the Kulmacher Eisbock for those interested) but I guess they have another hundred beers to choose from to help console my woes.  Cheers and happy beer-ing..oh and please drink responsibly ;)",

The fish was salty and the chicken in the pasta dish was bland and had no flavor, which was my husband's main complaint with the Jerk Enchilada Stack.  The server we had was okay, professional and doing his job.   We felt that for the lengthy wait, the food should at least have more flavor.   Seemed a tad overpriced for what you get.",

Most of the time the staff is helpful and friendly. They seem to enjoy or at least \"more than tolerate\" being at work. The food is fantastic, the happy hour deal is a real bargain and they always have sports on the big screens. One more awesome aspect: the music kicks a$$. Southern Fried Chicken dinner is fantastic. The Korean short ribs are one of the best appetizers. I get \"no onions\" on my chicken nacho's and they are so thoughtful that they put the Guacamole on the side because it has onions in it, Attention to detail, that most places lack. A+. My two bad trips. 1: they matinee waitress was rude, probably just having a bad day, but don't take it out on me. 2: My Korean short ribs were real fatty and under cooked, I never NEVER send food back so I was S.O.L.

Even though there's a bunch of outposts of this Irvine, CA based chain in LA (including the new LA Live location downtown) I've never been to Yard House before. Shame on me, I know. They've got their own microbrewed beer in two varieties and a great Late Night Happy Hour so prices are really good if you come in late for drinks or apps. Another thing I like is you can get a sample shot of any brew for a buck. Which is what I did as i sampled four different beers including Vegas' own Sin City. Bartender was actually upfront with me that it wasn't that great a beer but when in Vegas, try the local stuff and for a buck, why not? So I tried the Sin City Amber and it was fair alright but at least it wasn't downright atrocious. Surprisingly, Tenaya Creek isn't offered here. They should do something about that. Also odd. They carry Gordon Biersch. Don't they have their own brewpub just a couple miles away? Waste of taps in my opinion. Plenty of variety and a chance to really improve your brew knowledge. I've got to finally check one out in the LA area sometime soon especially that the LA Live location is now open.",

    "text": "Fun place to go for drinks and good times with friends!  I agree that the Happy Hour from 3-6 pm is definitely pretty sweet.  Can't go wrong with 1/2 on appetizers and drinks.  For appetizers, we tried the Onion Rings, California Roll, Fried Chicken Strips, Fried Calamari, Spicy Tuna Roll, and Blue Crab Cakes.  Onion Rings, Fried Calamari, and Blue Crab Cakes were all nice & crispy.  Fried Chicken Strips came with fries and were good as well, but nothing out of the ordinary.  The California Roll and Spicy Tuna Roll were interesting, in that their presentation was unlike that of those you see in a sushi restaurant.  They actually came as one huge, cut sushi piece, kind of like a cake or a tart.  The presentation was pretty unique, but the taste was also good but nothing really special.  If I was really craving sushi, I'd probably go check out normal sushi places like Osaka, Sushi Club, or something along those lines.  For drinks, I've tried the Mangolicious Martini, the Malibu Peach Martini, Blue Moon beer, and Wyder's Raspberry Cider.  I'm usually not a huge beer drinker, but the Wyder's was good...nice raspberry taste! Of course, looove the martinis!  And to top it all off, we all shared a Kona Coffee Ice Cream Sundae, which was to die for!!! I would definitely be hitting up Yard House a lot for Happy Hour with different groups of friends in the future.",

I certainly can't speak for anything on the menu aside from their appetizers, but everything that I have eaten has been excellent (and not just because I had downed multiple assorted beers).  The tap selection is unparalleled, which is great for people like me who like to see choices that go far beyond the basics like Sam Adams and Fat Tire.  They have scores of beers on tap that I haven't seen at any other bars in this city.  The only bad thing I could say is that they require 80% of your party to be present before they will give you a table.  That can be frustrating when you know that 10 co-workers are going to show up, yet they won't give you a big table because you only have 6 people present.  No matter, we usually just put in for the table and wait at the bar for everyone to show up.  Obviously I'm not too upset about it, because the great prices on Happy Hour appetizers and the ridiculous beer selection are what make me give this place a resounding 5 stars.",

    "text": "Yard House is by far my all time chain restaurant. How can you not love a place with a selection of pizzas, pastas, seafood, burgers, vegan, and gluten free!?! Wait did I mention they also have sushi!?? The first time I went here I looked at my boyfriend and said, \"WHY HAVE WE NOT ATE HERE BEFORE?\" He was as confused as me. However in the past 2 years I would say we have had our fair share of this place.  We have gone just us, we have taken my mom, and also taken the kids for a family event.  A couple of my favorite dishes include the Jambalaya, the garlic noodles, and the spicy tuna roll. The jambalaya actually has a spice! I hate it when places skimp out on dishes that are suppose to burn a little.  The sushi rolls come as one big roll. A layer of rice, then a layer of fish, wasabi, tempura etc. The presentation is so nice you don't want to eat it.  My biggest issue when dining here is not getting a soup, salad, appetizer, main entree, and dessert. I suggest going with someone you don't ming sharing with because you will want to try theirs too!  The recently added a salted carmel butterscotch pudding. Oh man, just put all my favs in one cup and serve it to me why don'tchya?  Decent prices, good service, open late, caters to parties small and large.  How a good chain should be!",

You'd think with a dish called lobster garlic there'd be garlic flavor right? It was very bland, dry and salty. Not much going on for such an intriguing dish.  Glad I had my favorite appetizer (chicken lettuce wraps) and a cup of the tomato bisque or it would have been a total bust.  Since my guy and I split everything we saved room for dessert. Ordered the baked brownie with a scoop of caramel ice cream. It says that it takes 15 minutes to bake and come out. Ours was about 25. Think our waitress forgot about it along with our drink refills.  Normally I'd rate yard house higher and be very happy. I guess the moral of the story is stick to what you know you like.",

Happy hour is M-F 3-6 PM, and Sun-Wed 10PM-1AM where a lot of their dishes are in the $5-8 range and drinks are even more reasonably priced.  I always go with friends and try a variety of their dishes. Their ahi poke bowl is decent although there are probably better poke places around Vegas, but it's decent for a bar. Thei fried calamari is always on point. I can never complain about good calamari. I've tried some of their lettuce wraps and they're all pretty good. If you're watching your sodium intake, some of their seasoned meats can tip you over the edge if you're not careful.  They have a wide selection of drinks available and I have a good time trying out different brews.  Their staff is friendly and mostly attentive although they can become forgetful if business becomes busy. However their staff should take their breaks away from public since some of their staff become rowdy when on break in front of the restaurant.  Overall the Yard House at Town Square is a good experience and you won't be disappointed to hang out with friends there.",

    "text": "Pop quiz: how sad is it that eating at this Yard House was one of my most anticipated moments before getting on the plane and heading out to Las Vegas for a few days? Gambling, glitz, girls and other words that start with \"G\" are all fine and dandy, but sometimes a guy just wants to down a few beers, chomp on some outstanding food and unwind in a place where not everyone is a raging tourist carrying an over-sized plastic drink that is watered down and reeks of desperation. This is that place.  My folks and I actually made it over here before they opened on a Monday morning and people were already lined up at 10:50 a.m. That's cool, right? This place clearly has a faithful audience, as evidenced by this review. And once those doors opened, shoot: it's like the customers in line thought the first 10 people in the door got a free unicorn that performs karaoke exclusively to hair metal songs. They rushed the door with a fervent desire to be first in and we just sort of meandered in after them. It's a big place with plenty of seats - there's no point in scrambling over each other to be the first one in. There's a lengthy patio, a surrounded bar and more seating than the average bar would know what to do with.  A hostess guided us to a booth opposite a table of nine individuals who exemplified the \"money cannot buy class\" rule. We overheard them tell the waitress they had to be out of there to catch a movie so right away you could tell this had potential to be the table from Hell. We already felt for this gal and then we realized she was waiting on us, too! Let it be known that Tasha, our waitress, got the MVP award for eternity during this shift because when the place opened, it appeared she got triple sat right out of the gate. Now I'm not an expert in the service industry but I know how hard it is to recover from a hand dealt like that in the opening minutes. We assured her we were in no rush, mostly because we weren't, and partly because we did not want to witness a breakdown on the floor. To her credit, she kept her cool and was efficient as she was sassy.  Speaking of keeping cool, you might want to psych yourself up before eating here because the menu is positively Dickensian with its verbiage. Six pages of beer alone?! No, you have not died and gone to Heaven; you just happened to wander into a place thriving with variety. Being that we stopped in for lunch, we stuck with sandwiches and the must-have lunch combo: a cup of soup and half a sandwich/pizza. Mom's chicken avocado sandwich was polished off with ease, Dad's... whatever Dad ate, was equally delicious, and my tortilla soup and pepperoni pizza were wolfed down in a shameful display almost as noticeable as my preference for hopping around the beer menu: Big Sky Moose Drool can totally give way to Kronenbourg 1664 if you try.  And through it all Tasha managed the suffocating requests of her demanding table, a performance that would go unnoticed if you were not paying attention given that everyone working here is a study in quick service and attentiveness. Food runners actually running food? Hostesses navigating the dining room with purpose? Bartenders keeping their orders flowing? You'd better believe it. We did not see a manager but I am assuming one was on duty, probably sitting in the rafters like Batman/woman, waiting to pounce when the need makes itself known.  There was one last bit of unfinished business: dessert. I'll just say this now: order the s'more brownie item. It will change your life. As the owner and operator of a beard and mustache, it almost made me consider shaving them off due to me realizing hot marshmallow embedded into my hair is not the most glamorous feeling. But wow if that was not the best way to go into a sugar coma that I have had the pleasure of eating in quite a while.  Yes, Yard House is a chain and yes, you know what you're getting by eating at one. But this one in particular has service and set up down to an art form. More TVs than you could ever watch? Extensive seating? A prime location away from most of the touristy things? Absolutely. And believe the hype, too - until the owners build one of these in Dallas, TX (hint, hint), it will remain a \"must-go\" destination for any upcoming Las Vegas trips. Who am I kidding? Even after they build one in Dallas, TX (nudge, nudge), I'll still be stopping here.",

    "text": "Our last experience here during this check in was a miss.  This place is usually great as it serves as a good place for grabbing a beer, watching sports, and eating some food.  This time,  I brought my wife and 2 yr old here and we had a little scary experience. We ordered a kid's meal for my daughter with an apple juice.  Out comes this kids cup with what looks like a cloudy apple juice.  Of course my wife (who is pregnant ) tries our baby's drink beforehand, and then tells me it tastes bad.  I took a sip, and it tasted like BEER.   WTH.  So I flag our server, I ask if apple juice is supposed to have a 'fizzy' type taste with it at this restaurant.  She said no.  She brought the drink over to her manager across the room and I saw him smell into the cup and then walk away.    A while later, we finally get the manager to our table, and he gave us this explanation:  \"I dont know what happened, but it wasn't beer.  It looks like our apple juice just fermented.  I don't know how that is possible since we usually go through the juice pretty fast and replace it.   Anyways, this is new apple juice now from a new barrel.\"    That's pretty much it.  No, real apology on what Im almost sure was beer.  No offer for any discount on our food or anything.  Afterwards he just left.  As for the food, nothing out of the ordinary.  Enjoyed, the ahi tuna poke.  That's about it. =T",

When we arrived at 6:30ish we were told that inside seating would be a 20 minute wait for two people, but outdoor seating was open immediately. We opted for outdoor seating since it wasn't too hot. And this would had been fine if it hadn't taken our waiter 15 minutes just to bring us water. Once we finally ordered, the wait staff seemed to not be communicating with the hostess. First, we kept getting all the food that the table to the left of us was ordering. Then, the table to the right of us was getting our food. It was super frustrating because the table kept accepting our food, and I had to tell the waiter it wasn't theirs - which was awkward. After we finally got our correct food, our service was slow and subpar. I went inside to use the bathroom and there was a hoard of waiters just standing around talking, and I had to say excuse me multiple times to get by. I was really upset and sweaty since our water kept going unfilled and we were seated outside. The people behind us got their water, but we did not. At one point I'm pretty sure we could have walked out without paying because we got no attention from our waiter. I'll be visiting a different location from now on, until this one gets better.",

It you want to sit you have to order food. Their food is pretty good. It's bar food with a fancy twist. They have happy hour with half price food. Great chicken fingers! Their tuna sushi roll is one big roll with soy beans in it and hard to eat. Not exactly something a lady should order while sitting AT the bar lol. All in all it's a great hang out place. A bit too trendy for people like me who love dive bars. But the beers,lagers,3 different cidars on tap who can complain!?",

    "text": "I don't know if the Yard House at Town Center is typical of other Yard House locations... but my first impression of the one at Town Center is \"Wow! The largest Bar / Sports Bar I've ever been to!\" The Bar must have been forty yards long with a circular seating arrangement... that's almost a football field length of seating just to consume liquor or watch your favorite team on one of the LCD TVs. Don't feel comfortable at the \"Bar\"? ... well there's dimly lit table seating around the extremities of the interior of the Yard House, as well as outside seating under a covered patio.  If you're not consuming your liquor at Happy Hour here at the Yard House... you have a lot more money to spare than I do, or you're just being extravagant for no rational reason. Lindeman's Framboise at only $4.00 a glass! Raspberry Cider, also at the same price! And, the Happy Hour extends late into the night...  As for the food... specifically the Appetizers... the menu needs work...    Spicy Thai Chicken Pizza (*) First of all, it's a thin-crust Pizza.. a        negative already! Carrots, Green Onion, Cilantro, Mozzarella,        Macadamia Nuts, and Firecracker Sauce as a topping... essentially        very, very close to a Vegan Pizza. Prior apologies to all Vegans...        Yecch!   Chicken Lettuce Wrap (**** 1/2) Stir fried, smoked tofu, pine nuts and        green onions with three dipping sauces with a meat choice of either        Chicken, Tiger Shrimp, or Shiitake and Portabella Mushrooms. Very,        very good.    Onion Ring Tower (****) Beer battered and dusted with Parmesan        Cheese... served with Chipotle and Ranch Dip Sauces. And... I don't        even like Onion Rings... that's saying a lot for the perfectly made        Onion Rings!   Chicken Nachos (**) Thin, and I mean thin Tortilla Chips with Cheddar        and Jack Cheese, Tomato, Cilantro, Onions, Guacamole and spicy        whole Pinto Beans. Chips were deteriorating as we sat. Word to the        wise... consume this appetizer quickly, or it just turns into mush.        Definitely, not as good as one of the many cheap, late-night Taquerias        you can find around Las Vegas.   Fried Calamari (**** 1/2) An appetizer which I never order because most        restaurants usually over-fry the Calamari where it becomes        super-tough and chewy... but not that night when we consumed it!        Served with spicy Tomato and Tartar sauces.   Spicy Tuna Roll (**) Definitely, not a favorite at the table. Not enough        Tuna, maybe? Or it could've been the odd mixture of textures with an        almost crunchy Edamame. Seared Ahi Tuna with Avocado, Edamame,        Cucumber and Wasabi Soy Sauce.   Classic Sliders (***) Nothing special here. Four mini Burgers made from        Naturewell Natural Angus Beef served with Cheddar Cheese, House        Special Sauce, Fries and Pickle. Preparation of the Fries were better        than the Sliders!  Do you know what it takes to transport all the Liquor over to the Bar area? As I was looking around Yard House to take some pics... I noticed the shiny pipes running along the ceiling emanating from the entrance area of Yard House heading off in the direction of the Bar. There are, literally, dozens of pipes that feed liquor to the bar stored in an Orange-hued room ( <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/uxe7CbaX8_9H82ljSg2Jxw/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a> ) ( <a href=\"http://static.px.yelp.com/bphoto/a1UfHHYUMxC145fLbNcyLw/l\">static.px.yelp.com/bphot...</a> ) to the left of the entrance as you walk in. Moving that much Liquor takes quite a bit of technology!  Liquor @ Happy Hour (*****) Appetizers (***)  Dessert? Not tonight. Went back to my son's house for Guava Cake ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery-san-jose#hrid:NKSpkOhHHESYQkF1WN_nOg\">yelp.com/biz/akis-bakery...</a> ), which I brought over from San Jose...",

I never knew they had ciders on the menu based on the names, but the new categories made it easy to see that they do...love the pear one!!!  My only issue with Yard House is that they don't have a late night happy hour on Thursday nights...I can understand the weekends, but what's up with Thursdays?? I always seem to get my Yard House cravings on Thursdays late night, but no Happy Hour :(",

We both thought the food was pretty good, the prices weren't great but they weren't crazy bad either.  I actually loved the way they cooked the chicken in my chicken caesar, so much that this one was probably the best caesar (and I order a lot of them) I've had since we've moved to the Vegas area.  Wouldn't come here regularly because it's in Town Center, which is too crowded for my tastes.  Plus there are so many other choices to try to come here regularly.  Oh the music they play (mostly classics) is very  very loud.  It didn't bother me, but my husband was really annoyed by it.",

The waitress took our drink and appetizer order while we waited for our friend. She delivered the drinks and appetizers yet there were no plates nor silverware and napkins on the table. She then turned us over to another waiter who scrambled to get proper settings.The calamari was over cooked ( dark brown and crunchy ).  The main course came; surf and turf.  Lets start with the lobster sauteed in garlic butter; dried out piece of rubber that once looked like a piece of lobster. Hamburger, medium rare was more like medium sawdust burger. Little flavor with zero juices.  The one stalk of asparagus was okay. The fries were somewhat good. I don't know where they hid the bearnaise sauce but it wasn't on our plates.  All that said 3 of us was  $ 130.00 of  utter slop.  Save your cash for someplace that actually knows how to cook food.",

I've tried the one in San Diego which is OK so I didn't have high expectations, especially since this one is in a big mall. Well, the food and service were excellent. We had a couple of salads, the lettuce cups, ahi sashimi, mac n cheese and the beef dip. All excellent, but that shashimi won over 2 non-raw-fish eaters at the table. It was really outstanding. We will definitely be eating here when we're in Vegas again!!",

Yardhouse is famous for all the beer it has on tap, i beleive its something like 100 types or somewhere close to that.  This location is in Town Square right next to Rave Motion Pictures, so instead of paying $20 for popcorn and soda, stop by Yardhouse and get a real meal!  You can go there just about anytime and have some great appetizers, entree's or dessert!  It's usually busy at night any time on the weekend so get there early.  Especially if your trying to watch the game.  It's a great place to go and I will go again, especially now since they have one in Red Rock Casino.",

The manager was sympathetic and promised gift cards, but they never came. After speaking to another manager tonite, I am compelled to write this review. He was dismissive and questioned whether any of this even took place! I tried to reason with him for 20 minutes, but to no avail. No apology was offered until requested and he questioned if we should even receive gift cards- AFTER WE WERE LAID UP FOR 2 DAYS OF OUR VACATION! Poor customer treatment.",

For happy hour, the Ahi sashimi is so good. Perfectly seared with the right amounts of pepper and seasoning. Also the Margherita pizza has a good blend of garlic, mozzarella, and tomato. Their fried calamari was fried perfectly with the right crunch. Their wings, wraps and fried Mac cheese I'll pass. For non happy hour entrees, their jambalaya is like the best fried rice I've had; spicy but you can still taste the freshness of the seafood. In addition their shrimp and calamari diavolo is a must try. Almost everything here is perfect, parking is easy, the ambiance can be family or bar like, the service was too good (it was a Friday too), their happy hour is a good bang for the buck, and the location is convenient like right next to an AMC. The only reason why this is 4 stars is because not all the foods were perfect lol.",

We walked in today at 11am with a party of six and sat in a nearly empty restaurant.  A hour later the place is packed, due to an obvious large following, and our entrees are just now arriving!  In addition to that, some items are now cold?  Weird!  The Moo Shu Egg Rolls were large and quite outstanding!  The Vampire Tacos however were fairly tasty but quite cold to the touch!  The Pork Lumpia, Filipino egg rolls will sweet chilies, was a rather disappointing appetizer! Entrees ordered around our party included the BBQ Pizza which was good but certainly not something noteworthy!  The Nashville Hot Chicken however was outstanding!  Two fried chicken breasts that are dipped in hot sauce, served with three mini sweet potato pancakes that are to be dipped into honey and ranch!  Our server Jared, I believe, was incredibly friendly and tried his best to make up for the inconveniences!  I will admit that the manager came by to offer to refire items, but we'd waited a hour for our food and waiting longer wasn't an option.  Some items are great, some average, and quite a few were not recommendable!",

Every recommendation I've gotten has always been a great one. Recently came here last night with a party of 18 and I love how they're always able to accommodate. Being able to accommodate large parties at short notice is always very important. I also really love how you can have separate checks for a large party. I've only had one bad server since coming here for years, but every other interaction cancels that one out. I enjoy their calamari a lot! Love coming here.",

Most recently stopped in after a movie and caught the Reverse Happy Hour. Great selection of dishes, appetizers, and drinks.   Anything on the menu is delicious, and they have a large menu to choose from.   Most recent visit we got the calamari, which was a bit tough, hard to chew. The Poke Nachos, delish as always. Lumpia appetizer -- sausage filling, good and not bad at all, but don't expect it to be the traditional Filipino lumpia.   This was the first time I got the sashimi and didn't know or ask how it was served. The sauce was too sweet for me, so I'll ask to remove it next time. Other than that, I really liked it! Sashimi craving satisfied.   All from the Reverse Happy Hour Menu!   Everything was delicious.   2018 Yelp Review #24",

I called ahead and they told me to go to their website to put my name on the list in advance, when we got there it was busy but we did not have to wait more than 3 minutes.  I went several weeks ago but our server was so awesome I remember his name. Bryson gave us recommendations and he changed one of the TVs for us so we could watch the hockey game. After we ordered we were just browsing the drink menu and he asked if we wanted to try any beer samples. He said everyone gets 1 free sample and he recommended to try a \"fun\" beer because it's a sample so why not. He recommended us a peanut butter stout, which was fun and I did enjoy it. Because he was so great we decided to actually order drinks as well.  I had a shrimp and lobster pasta which was sooo tasty but the portion was so small. I was hungry afterwards and disappointed but I'd go to try something else next time. My boyfriend got the Nashville spicy chicken and he loved it.",

    "text": "So I will start by saying I'm definitely a yard house fan and have been here too many times to count, however, over the past year I feel like the quality of the food has gone from 5 star to 4 and I'll explain why.  First about 6-9 months ago they changed there fries and if you read reviews everyone always loved the small fries and then you could make them truffle and they were <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> but now there fries are nothing more than the same thing you would find at your local jack in the box. Next is they have changed the happy hour menu so some of the favorites are no longer on their like noodles and bone in wings and a few other items . These changes kinda hurt my feelings a little lol  Now on to the good! They still have a lot of items on happy hour and just recently they changed it to half off the happy hour menu vs having a tiered pricing which is nice. The portion size of all their food is good and the pricing is fair , also they are a full brewery so you can get your drink on and be happy. Another thing I like is the atmosphere, it's casual with a lot of tv's so you can go catch a game or have a date night or even just grab a snack before you head to the club, This place meets every criteria . My favorites are the carnivore pizza and the sliders, and I like to order a onion ring tower and add the onion rings to my slider so I kinda create my own slider lol.",

They usually have a good amount of customers every time we come here but it never affects the solid customer service we receive.   Today, we came around 3pm, were seated promptly and our drink orders came all in the span of 5 mins. We ordered off of the HH menu which ranged from $3-$8 per dish. The onion ring tower, poke nachos, and calamari plate were enough to feed a group of four comfortably but of course we ordered all that just between the two of us. The bill reached about $20, not bad for dishes that usually cost double during regular hours.   The inside is kinda dim which portrays a more intimate setting. A little loud when the games are on the bar tv (or when people deliberately scream when they're talking to the person in front of them) but overall I like coming to this place.  I can only assume that this place is better than the one at the Linq since that's tourist central. If you're local, you should come to this location!",

What made me write this review is because we had an amazing server. His name is Celal (I hope I spelled that correctly!). His service was great! He made sure our water cups was always full, and he came to check on us regularly but without being overwhelming. All restaurants need someone like Celal! Anyways, if you're looking for something casual, good food and drinks, Yard House is the place to be.",

Great food and drink prices. I will say it is noisy in there but that is probably because it was Friday eve. They are near the AMC theater. Great food, drinks and server was great. I had a margarita pizza but others had poke nachos, lumpas, lettuce wraps all half price til 6. No complaints. I will be back again soon. Good option for anyone at the strip to get away and spend some time at town square shopping, walking around or even a movie. Town square is really a nice place to visit.",

    "text": "I have been to several Yard Houses and it's always good. The Town Square one has to be the most convenient one I have been to. Good parking and an easy walk from the back parking lots of Town Square.  The service here is superb! We ordered a Hefe-weizen and they said it would take a minute to switch taps. We got it right away. To have a local place that has German beer on tap is pretty awesome.  The food is fantastic too, I've never had a bad dish. On my last visit, we shared the Queso dip. It was pretty ooey-gooey and very delish. I think it needed more chips though, we kind of ran out and started piling on the queso towards the end.  I think I heard my arteries screaming \"For the love of God, not all at once! \"   For my main dish, I ordered the miso sea bass with bokchoy and brown rice. I'm a huge fan of miso fish dishes after trying the miso cod at Nobu in 2009. So the miso sea bass at YH is one of my favorites. The sweetness and the freshness of the fish was impressive. I also prefer brown rice, so having it as an alternative over white rice is always a plus.  Yay for Yard House!",

Unfortunately, upon sitting down, I saw their happy hour was a completely different time frame, so we asked our server, Jordyn, about their happy hour. We told her that when we called, we got a different answer, and she said she would ask management if maybe they had another special going on. In the quick five minutes, not only did she find out what happened (the hostess was new and wasn't clear on times) but she spoke to her manager about the miscommunication and was able to get us happy hour priced appetizers. That showed that she truly cared about the service she gave to her customers AND was able to fix it! In such a quick manner as well!   My boyfriend and I were originally debating on staying because we were a little upset, but this definitely displayed great customer service and I knew that Jordyn will surely take care of us. We ended up ordering poke nachos, calamari, the carnivore pizza, and 2 tacos (kbbq and a fish taco). The food was delicious as always! Yardhouse is always my favorite chain restaurant.  We also ordered 2 micheladas each. After the first round, Jordyn said another bartender just clocked in that makes amazing micheladas and ensured she would make ours. She was very attentive and very clearly catered to us!   When it was time to pay out our check, not only did Jordyn remember our discounted appetizers, but she was able to comp them completely off! My boyfriend and I have both worked in the service industry, and so we are both very critical when it comes to customer service, but she was amazing from the time we sat down to the time we paid out our check.   If we could have her be our server every time, we definitely would!!",

Everything tasted great, the food was fancy and fresh, it is not chain restaurant style food. It's fresh and stylish and worth a few extra bucks.

Yard house has never really been a go to place for me but we had to meet in the middle. This location in town square was really nice. They have outdoor patio seating which is always a plus. They offer happy hour everywhere inside not just the bar area. They have a lot of options for happy hour not just a select food like most places.  I asked our waiter which sangria she preferred and she suggest I go with the red which a little sweeter and mixed with Hennessy I loved it. I decided to go with lettuce wraps they were good I liked the 3 sauces it came with. My friends ordered a Caesar salad and calamari, the calamari was ok nothing special. My vegan friend got the \"gardien\" wings which looked like boneless chicken nuggets. I'm personally not a fan of substitute meat so when I tried it, it tasted funny with a nasty after taste. The service was decent nothing special to write home about. I would like to come back and try there entrees.",

I tried almost everything on the menu and can't go wrong with the Chilean Sea Bass.  The bad boy is one of the priciest items on the menu though.  There is also great appetizers from poke to street tacos...good for complimenting your choice of beer.    The Yard House in the Town Square is always bustling and nearly impossible to get a table without some sort of wait.  The happy hour menu is pretty good as well.  I usually just take up the standing room along the bar.    The countless screens should cover all your sports needs, and if not, the helpful staff should be able to flip the channel to your desire.    Still, the main reason I come here is for the beers.  My favorites include Delirium Tremens, Chimay Cinq Cents, Trois Pistoles, Gulden Draak and a special offering of Firestone Sucaba (limited offer).  I have visited the other location at Red Rock and noticed that they seem to be less packed.  Either way, they are perfect for pre-funking, dinner, or whenever you get thirsty.  P.S. put the waitlist buzzer pager in your pants to get an unexpected surprise!  Never gets old...",

There are these little U's next to menu items that are under 600 calories, and to my pleasant surprise, they had a 5 oz. turkey burger with a salad with cirtrus soy dressing with a U next to it.  Fan-effin-tastic!!  I ordered it, despite thinking of every dry, tasteless \"healthy\" burger I've ever eaten.  My expectations were low.  Granted, I've never ordered anything at Yardhouse before that I didn't like, but the pessimism from my experience with healthy non-beef burgers trumped my consistent satisfaction with the food from Yardhouse.    Our meals came quickly and my neat little plate of burger and salad (with dressing on the side, which I didn't even ask for, thanks server!!!) actually looked quite delicious.  Upon my first bite, I was in heaven!  It was juicy, tasty, delicious goodness in my mouth.  It came topped with roma tomatoes, which I think really sealed the deal.  At 5 ounces, I finished my entire plate and felt perfectly full, unlike most of the time when I go out to lunch and overstuff my face.  I was so happy that I promptly forgot about the annoying sales rep I had dealt with at a meeting earlier that morning. I was ready to go back to work with a renewed pep in my step.  The service at Yardhouse is always fast, efficient and friendly.  Although, I used to have this one server that would always try to upsell shots and drinks during my business meetings.  It was quite awkward, but I haven't seen him the last few times I've been, so maybe he quit when he realized the lunch crowd here was not exactly his demo.  We've always been able to get a table quickly for both lunch and dinners.  I also love sitting at the bar sometimes at night and trying new beers from their vast selection.  Yardhouse is just an all-around great spot!",

It's at Town Square and right by UNLV, perfect place to go to during Happy Hour with the amount of draft beers they have!!  The restaurant is huge inside with outdoor seating!! I like sitting outside during fall/spring time frame and definitely indoors during winter and summer. It's a laid back chill environment that's good for everyone. The ambient lighting is good for that kind of romantic feeling if you want it to be, but also just to relax and chill.   I'm here for Happy Hour with a bunch of friends usually, we used to frequent this place at least once a week, now not so much as we're getting tired of the same ol' thing, lol.   I like trying something different every time I come here as far as the draft beer goes. I've tried almost everything and found some of my favorite types through doing this! Just gotta keep an open mind and be willing to try something new in order for this to work out! Amber ales have been my favorites, followed by stouts, and then lagers, but I've also been spoiled by what's on tap and now I stay away from bottled beer as much as possible! It really does taste different.  With my friends and I, we usually just stick around to what's on the appetizer menu, because they're half off during Happy Hour. Some of our favorites include the Chicken Nachos, Chicken Tenders, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Sliders, Spinach artichoke dip, and pizza. You'll almost always see these items on our table from the Happy Hour menu. Other items we usually end up ordering are the Truffle Fries and the Mac & Cheese. The portions are decent for the appetizers and good for sharing, especially the Chicken Nachos.   It's good for just all around hang out with a bunch of friends to just relax and catch up. I don't usually do large groups at other places, but here it's fine, because it does get pretty loud.",

    "text": "I've tried most of the watering holes and food joints in and around Town Square.  Of course, it is always a hit and miss.  I've tried Miller's Ale House on the opposite side of the outdoor mall also and I can say that Yard House is, hands down, way better than Ale House - in so many levels.  Am not a big fan of chain or franchised restaurants and tend to be very judgmental of them.    My friend was starving after watching the most recent Superman movie at the Rave, or AMC Theaters.  I blamed my friend for choosing Ale House the last time because that was just a waste of a hard earned money so we went to Yard House which is literally a few steps away from the cinema.  I wasn't very happy of the choice, but hey, I might as well give it a try.   We were quickly seated and drinks were served in a flash.  I ordered their Spicy Jambalaya with linguini instead of rice, and my friend ordered their Parmesan Crusted Chicken.   My review is based on the food that I pig out on.  My friend liked the chicken too, more than the pork medallion (actually pork schnitzel) from Ale House.    We didn't wait long for our entrees.  The Jambalaya pasta came tolerably hot.  Good servings, if I may add.  It was reasonably seasoned.  Not that spicy as I was expecting but there sure was some kind of a bite and kick because of the paprika, cheyenne pepper and cajun seasonings.  The dish was perfectly tossed in cajun sauce generously packed with small shrimps, roasted red and green peppers, fresh tomatoes, slivers of andouille sausage and topped with two grilled huge shrimps (mini prawns).  I remember having Jambalaya pasta from Cheesecake Factory and Claim Jumpers decades ago and I thought they were good, but Yard House's is better.    We liked the way our server/waitress didn't bother us every 5 minutes or so asking how everything was.   We were left to enjoy and savor our food, and only came when necessary (refilling our drinks, clearing up our table and bringing in the check).  Suffice to say, i finished my plate and was happy with it.  Total damage for me was $25.00.  A bit pricey for a pasta dish but considering the ambience and the service, it wasn't that bad.",

Atmosphere was wonderful on the patio, however our waiter seemed like he did not want to be there.  We sat down, and had 2 others join us a few minutes later.  We ordered our drinks first, and he brought the others, and never bothered to ask the other 2 if they wanted drinks.  Every time we wanted something, we had to ask, he was never around.  When it came time for dessert, he just brought our checks.  We had to tell him we wanted dessert.  He was pleasant, just not a good waiter.  It will be a long time before we return.",

    "text": "Yard House has been updated to a 5 star, after several visits helped to elevate it to one of the best overall restaurants on the west end.  The most recent visit was after a disastrous experience at the Gordon Biersch down the street (See Review). I am willing to admit that my disgust with GB's could have influenced this particular visit to Yard House, but after all, the right time and the right place are also factors by which we develop opinions.  I had two items off the happy-hour appetizer menu, the Seared Ahi Tuna and the Spicy Tuna Roll.  The bartender kindly warned me that the Spicy Tuna Roll was presented in a completely different manor than I was probably used to, offering my a bit of his personal insight to allow me an opportunity to rethink my decision. But I am a culinary warrior with the self-proclaimed fortitude that has catapulted me toward some of the worlds greatest food discoveries - and I was not about to be deterred by unconventionalism.  The presentation was unusual, to say the least. But this work of art was visionary delight, in a castle of tuna, a delightfully mild wasabi sauce and a number of items I wont embarrass myself trying to identify. It was almost too beautiful to want to breach the walls of this incredible castle, but the urge to sample its goods was too tempting. I can say, although its taste resembled a spicy tuna roll in many ways, it uniqueness made it truly a one of a kind item.  The Seared Ahi Tuna, which I had had before, was delicious as always and its presentation rivaled that of its chivalrous brother.  I am truly blessed to be within a stones throw of Yard House. I suggest you stop in some time - you might just see me there.",

Never checked on us or followed up on drinks, by the time he came around we weren't thirsty anymore. Fast forward to the sales transaction....server acknowledged two credit cards and repeated to us that he was going to split the check. Server comes back with only one credit card to which the entire check was charged. After minutes of flagging down our server we told him that only one card was charged and one card was missing he quickly took the check back and walked back to the registers. Minutes pass and he returns again now with both cards with split checks and said that the missing card was declined so that's why he didn't bring it back the first time. Dumbfounded, we then brought to his attention that one card was now charged twice (I verified through my online bank app) and his explanation for the other card missing for five minutes during the transaction is extremely suspicious and made no sense. We demanded to speak to a manager and the manager cited that it was busy and there was just a mix up on the registers. To add insult to injury he then tried to diffuse the situation/appease us by offering $5 gift cards! Wow! What we wanted was an explanation for the missing card and a guarantee that we wouldn't get charged three, four, five times for bad service. We walked away with his business card, which we had to ask for and an insincere apology from our server.   Be sure to dine here if you want subpar service or want to be scammed!  Note: I had to give them a star to continue with this post!",

While I have no difficulty getting a Molson or something even harder to come by, I also have to pay $6 for it.  And that's for a standard 12 ounce glass.  I know Vegas alcohol prices can be inflated but that's a bit much.  I don't have much experience with the food.  I got some fries with a beer here once and they were on the greasy side.

Don't get me wrong.. food here is great but the service of the waitstaff needs a little work. The last time I was there, the food runner dropped off our pizza at the table next to us. We were already irritated the food was taking long so we saw the whole thing. The girls next to us were talking among themselves that they got a free pizza and proceeded to pick and eat the toppings off. The server came by 5 minutes later and apologized to the other table... TOOK THE PIZZA OFF THEIR TABLE... AND DROPPED IT ON OUR TABLE and said \"Sorry... here, enjoy!\" Gross. That was the last straw.. I'm NEVER going back there again. Try the Summerlin or the LINQ location. I've been to both and it's MUCH better service there.",

Thing I hate: the loud ass music that they play from time to time. It's annoying!!! I walk out of there sometimes feeling like I just got out of a club! WTF.",

Their pork belly banh mi sandwich is really good and I don't if it's just because of the hype with Vietnamese food or the location but $13 is a bit much for only half a sandwich considering a full banh mi hoes for maybe $4. They have a pretty good selection of beers and wines. It's a nice establishment and the location is great especially after you are done strolling through the plaza!",

Whether it's when we're sitting outside, getting showered by the misters, or we're inside and my friend Grace is spilling her water all across the table and I'm pulling a Neo and miraculously dodging a drenching; they've always got some witty remark to keep the ball rolling.  Maybe we're just setting them up with situations to be a smart ass, or they're just naturally that clever.  Either way, it's always a good time.  The goods: Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour. Happy Hour.  Their apps are re-dic and when they're half off they taste even better.  Love the calamari and chicken tenders.  Had a beer called \"Twilight\".  Combination of Guinness and Blue Moon.  Honestly I just got it because I hoped Edward Cullen would come sprinting around the corner.  Kidding...or am I?  No, seriously though, it was a great beer.  Not too sweet, not too bitter.  The atmosphere:  It's a pretty live joint, day or night.  Can't tell the locals from the tourists; don't really care.  Everyone's there for the same thing.  Great place for girls night out because according to Maria, Yardhouse gives out condoms because their waiters are fiiiiiinnnnnnnnnne.  I'm not gonna disagree with her, but I try not to leer at the employees.  Call me crazy but I think drooling into my buffalo wings while I'm undressing Timmy/Justin/Brad with my eyes would be considered rude.  The place is a lot of fun, and it's a walk away from Cadillac Ranch (which I heard will be closing soon!?!) and Blue Martini.  If you're on the South side of town, I would definitely recommend this place.",

The server only checked up on us once to fill my cup with water, after she never came to see if we were okay.    Food: The food here is alway great, especially when they have happy hour.

    "text": "My first time at the Yard House wasn't really anything special, but I can see why people would like it. The ambiance is cozy for sports enthusiasts and beer connoissers.  They have about 150 different beers on tap which is impressive. I sat at the bar and had one of the beers on tap. After looking thru their extensive beer menu, I ordered the Sin City Light; it was good. It's about $6 for a beer. So for the most part, the bar is what makes the place; along with all the flat screen TVs mounted throughout.  As a restaurant...they need A LOT of work. I ordered the Roast Beef Dip. A simple dish (it's a sandwich for crying out loud), how can anyone get that wrong...Au Jus was too salty. That's what makes the sandwich! Also, they need to melt the provolone in the sandwich. They just slapped on a cold piece of cheese! One of my friends had the Porter House Steak. She had ordered it medium, but she realized as she was cutting into the steak that it was a little on the rare side. Once she pointed that out to our non-attentive waiter, he did take the steak back and correct it. The manager even brought it back out to her and apologized for that and did not charge for her entree. That was nice of him... My cousin had the lettuce wraps. I didn't try them, but he says that the wraps were really good. My brother had the Ahi salad. He liked it. The prices on their food menu are comparable to that of a Chilis or Chevy's.  Now about our waiter...Seems like he was trying to avoid us the whole time we were there. The sad thing is that he was also training someone on the floor that night; what a good example he is setting for the trainee! We had to wave him down a couple of times for drinks and a couple times for condiments. Come to think of it, we didn't even get place settings until after our food arrived. We had to ask another waiter for that! He only came by to check on us once, and that was the same time he slapped us the bill.",

The tables which line the area between the booths and the centered bar are spaced well enough to accomodate large parties as well as not wreck the view from the bar or the booths. The outdoor seating wraps around the outer perimeter of the restaurant, so if you don't mind sitting in 100 degree heat, there are patio options as well. The HH rocks. Great food specials and beer and wine specials. We sampled quite a few of the appetizers and they were pretty tasty.  For Vegas, it's hard to find a place that's not sooo overpriced you can't get a snack for a reasonable price. You must know me to know how important snacks are :)  The servers were cool. The atmosphere was OK. This is a place  would recommend to my family members who never travel, because they will feel right at home. Nothing unique of spectacular, but comfortable and you know what you're getting.",

In my short week stay in Vegas a few weeks ago, I went there quite a few times, and I'm not ashamed to say so. The bartenders were very sweet & talkative and always made sure my glass was full, there was a limited douche bag status (I didn't have any drunk a*holes falling on me, and spilling their beers on me), and I LOVE the music selection (I usually end up playing drunk air guitar, and mouthing the words at least once or twice). I just love this place, and I WILL be back ;-)",

THAT was pretty good.  & for an appetizer, the portion was quite big.  It seemed to be more of a main dish to me.  It came with a choice of white or brown rice.  Super yummy! Southern Belle for my drink was refreshing. Ahhh.... ; ) Definitely will order that again. lol. The guy who seated us & our waitress was very nice.

The food is always very good, although the atmosphere can be annoying sometimes with the insanely huge singles crowd simply there to drink and look for a date. My only pet peeve about this spot is that they don't have any type of call ahead seating or reservations, so if you go on Friday or Saturday, expect to wait at least an hour for a table. Something like that just bothers me, I don't care if you want to take a credit card to hold a reservation like the high end joints do here in Vegas, but at least give us the option of reserving a table! Other than the insane waits and sometimes slow service, the food is great! Try the lettuce wraps!",

I normally always opt for outside seating in restaurants but even I needed a temporary break from the 100+ degree heat.  The waiter was very good - checking back frequently on everything and keeping our drinks full.  I loved the Enchilada Stack - who knew a beer restaurant could serve a great mexican style meal.  It had tons of lean white meat chicken, lots of cheese and yummy green and red enchilada sauce.  I finished the whole thing which I never do!  My husband enjoyed his steak as well.",

We ordered the following items: 1. Mooshu eggrolls -  love this and strongly recommend to try it out 2. Calamari -  too oily,  which I'm having a heart burn now.  3. Buffalo wings -  super spicy.   I guess I should have asked for light on sauce; still good to order 4. Penne with chicken -  it was kinda good.   Too much sauce even though my daughter requested for less sauce.  5. Jambalaya with brown rice - can't feel the spice of Jambalaya except for excessive sauce.  6. Lobster garlic noodles -  too salty.  If not salty then this will be a perfect dish.  Anyhow, kid's pepperoni pizza was amaze. I like it more than my dish .  I gave this four stars due to the taste of the food.   Overall,  still recommend people to eat here.",

Good luck with the service.  Service is normally better at tables, unless it's really jam packed with tourists.  Wanna be treated like bros trying to get their underage friends drunk? This is the place for you, otherwise, go to any other place nearby.  People at work always insist on comIng here for functions, which is the only reason I'm here. I really loathe this place. Go downtown, there are far better places to drink and a way more genuine and interesting environment.",

Love their happy hour menu, delicious food, great portion and for cheaper.  Nachos, huge portion and delicious, perfect for sharing. Loaded with bean, cheese, chicken, jalepeno, sour cream, pico, guac... the goods!!  Shitake Garlic Noodle - smaller portion, good for one - very good.. not crazy garlicky.  Hummus - they have a chili oil type on top that adds such great flavor to the hummus, but not spicy at all.  Fried Calamari is delicious - decent portion, crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside, the aioli that it comes with is delicious.  ABSOLUTE FAV: Firecracker wings - these have a little kick to them, salty and sweet at the same time - great flavors - a must try! Chicken Lettuce Wrap - pretty big portion, good for sharing - 3 options for sauce - all very good! The Seared Ahi sandwich is so good.. I'm usually not a sandwich person but I will eat this one any day.  Mac & Cheese - not for kids - truffle oil and wild mushroom - so good...  I can go on and on and on because I have tried most of the items on their menu - but these are the ones I always go back to!",

We ordered drinks and the martini that i ordered was barely half full but when I pointed it out, it was as if \"I\" did something wrong. I called to complain to the Manager, who we met that evening. Though he is very nice and mentioned what they all stand for and how service \"should be\", I was offered nothing as a result of what turned out to be a HORRIBLE experience. I will never go to this location again where EVERY person that I experienced working there that night, besides the Manager, appeared angry to be there or unhappy. NO thank you.   M Hannah",

I have always liked Yard House because they have an entire Gardein section (fake meat dishes) on their menu that I just go nuts for. I started hyperventilating the first time I went to Yard House. I always end up ordering the Spicy Chicken Gardein Sandwich, which runs me about $12-$13. For some weird reason the Spicy Chicken Sandwich is not on the menu but it is online. Regardless, the waiters know exactly what I'm talking about when I place my order. The portions are always overwhelming, which takes me to my happy place.    The menu and beer section at Yard House is ridiculously huge. I think that's why Yard House is so popular - it's great for groups! The vibe at Yard House is great. People are buzzing and if you don't mind talking loud, you'll be fine. The dim lighting makes everyone prettier too lol. The prices sneak up on you though. It's one of those restaurants where you get the bill and you wonder how it got so high. Sneak attack!!",

This location.. Well.. I mean it was just okay because I really didn't feel anything was 4-5 star worth type of service. The drinks are what was really disappointing. Our waiter was very friendly and cool however that didn't make up for the weak drinks that the bartender was pouring up that night. I ordered a long island because I know it should have a PUNCH to it, and it wasn't even a jab to say the least. My bf ordered a Long Beach and that too wasn't made well. When we were asked would we like another drink from our waiter I had to kindly decline and let him know that the first round was awful. He informed me that they do some sort of measuring technique and I guess can't pour more alcohol than what's listed. I don't know but we ended up only ordering appetizers off the happy hour specials because after the under whelming drinks I was ready to depart! Chicken nachos are HUGE and filled with flavor, Calamari was great as well. Will I be back? Maybe...",

Usually the bartenders are on point and more than willing to serve, but not tonight.  When we sat down the bartender asked if I wanted a drink (as she should), but when I said I needed a second she had a little attitude. I was also waiting for my wife to join me and she returned a few times with no drink order yet. After that it seemed like she wanted nothing to do with us.    We ordered some fried cheese curds (which were delicious), but took nearly 40 minutes to arrive. When it came time to order food I made it blantely obvious we needed something and no one came to help. Finally tracked down a bartender who said \"I thought you ordered already\".  Our 2 salads took another 30 minutes to get.   May have to rethink when I want yard house again which is sad because I generally love this place.",

Alas, my last two visits to your restaurant had been less than stellar. How very disappointing.   A few weeks ago, your zealous bus boy cleared my food from my table when I accompanied my child to the bathroom. That was somewhat annoying but forgivable - after all you've always been very efficient with your service. And you made good on our food with new plates of food very promptly. Thank you. I appreciated that. I just wish you could be more prompt with your bathroom clean up.   Then yesterday, my child and I headed to your restaurant again to get a quick bite before our movie. Service was great, your wait staff is fantastic. But I can't say the same about your dishwashing staff. There was an awful lot of somebody else's lipstick on the glass you served me. That was an appetite killer. My inner germaphobe had a mini freak out moment. See picture. There's no excuse for that.  All that said, I still like you. You have nice people and good food. I'll just have to check my glass and guard my food more closely when I next dine at your place.",

I'm not a huge beer drinker, but they have a big selection to choose from so I feel like anyone can find something for them on the menu!

Also I should mention a vast array of beer. With reasonable prices great service and an expensive menu, you can't go wrong. So take a break from shopping and enjoy yourselves.

We shared an order of Fried Calamari.  It came with tartar and spicy tomato sauce.  There was a good amount of tentacles and body breaded in a heavy cornmeal breading.  My friend ordered the half order of Ahi Crunchy Salad which had 4 pieces of seared rare ahi, field greens, asian slaw and crispy wontons tossed in soy vinaigrette.  The full order had 6 pieces of seared rare ahi and more field greens.  My other friend ordered the lunch portion of BBQ Pizza and a Classic Ranch Salad.  The salad was just iceberg lettuce with shredded carrots, cucumber, and tomatoes.  I ordered the lunch portion of half a Roast Beef Dip and a cup of Clam Chowder. There was not a spoon on the plate, so I had to track down our server.  The Roast Beef Dip was tender and the creamy horseradish was really good.  Next time I would order a whole Roast Beef Dip which comes with fries.  i had also ordered a side of french fries.  They were warm, not freshly fried.  The server brought out a complimentary Mini Lemon Souffle with fresh raspberries and house made whipped cream with a candle for my friend's birthday.  It was very light.  I will be back.",

It's in Town Square, which is a suburban ped-mall with bars, restaurants, shops, and a movie theater, not too different from, for you Chicagoans, Streets of Woodfield or the Glen of Glenview.    They have an excellent beer selection.  I shared the tuna sashimi and vodka sauce shrimp pasta with someone.  Both were very good!  The food is good quality and the menu varied.    No, this isn't a big Vegas restaurant, and it's not too dissimilar from a beer/restaurant that you'd find at home.  But that makes it comfortable, and they do a good job.",

Which is funny because they were talking to each other a lot. More than they were talking to any guest, no wonder they are working the day shift. Fries were really cold chicken was hot though.  They didn't put out ketchup for me and none of them paid enough attention to see my hand wave at them. So I ate without.  When I was five I waited 13 min for someone to take my cars that was sitting there. And it wasn't even the two bartenders that were serving my side of the bar... It wasn't even that busy.   No real upsides. So one star.",

They also had late happy hour from 10pm-close while we were there so that was a plus! My group ordered a bbq chicken pizza, mac and cheese, spicy tuna roll, poke nachos, blue crab cakes, vampire tacos, and truffle fries. I was able to get a taste of each and would have to say the food was good overall, but I especially liked the truffle fries! Not many restaurants have the skinny type of fries so it good. The poke nachos were also very savory and different. My friend also ordered a martini, but couldn't handle the alcohol so she asked the server and he gladly accommodated by offering her a replacement drink. Service was pleasant, which was surprising coming from a chain restaurant. Overall, would come back for more late night munchies! On a side note, parking could be limited here, but still manageable.",

I ordered  a ketle martini and mushroom wraps also some garden wings my bf ordered a few beers and a pizza. When it came out it was delicious but when I went to bite my wraps there was a black long beatle that crawled from under neath one of the lettuce wraps and I'm not going to lie i spit out my food and almost threw up, I am actually a vegan and have a very sensitive stomach I just couldn't believe how gross you can at least check the lettuce before serving. A Mgr came by said don't worry he would take care of it when I got the bill I of course had a 35 dollar ck. My wings drink and his food was still on it. Not like it matters but it kinda does, I would think it would be alil more compensated. I still of course took care of everything the server as its not her fault there was bugs in their food but I literally didn't eat anything after that I just didn't feel like they cared. Please be more caring and understanding of your customers",

The wait isn't as long as BJ's, we waited after 8 for a table for 3 for about 20-30 minutes.  However, the prices seem a little higher than BJ's.  My friend who lives out there took bf & I to dinner here since her & her bf eat here all the time.  Though parking was kind of difficult, I love the location of the restaurant in Town Square.  Town Square reminds me of The Grove in LA without the snootiness.  I loved my Cuban Roast Pork Sandwich!  The pork was moist and the pepperjack cheese was melted nicely.  The au ju was a perfect accompaniment...even though the sammie didn't need it because the meat was not dry at all.  It also came with a mountain of crispy shoestring fries.  Oh god, I just looked at the site's nutrition facts for it....luckily I saved half of it for the next day.   Bf thought his BBQ Chicken Pizza was okay.  And my friend always gets the same pasta dish that she enjoys.",

I went for a \"sampler\". 2 versions, one is lighter (which I had), the other is heavier. $8.95 for 6 small glasses of beers from San Francisco - Alaska.  It was good. Food Looked great. I didn't eat. Just there to check it out. Hard to tell who wasn't on business in the crowd due to all of the credit card purchases (or debit maybe?). Suspect though there were locals.  Nice room. BIG! Screens everywhere with piped in Vid's. Music, I heard Foghat, Alice Cooper, and......lost track.  Good crowd. 20's -30's. It was Saturday night.  It's on the South side of Town Square (near the Airport). Just behind Guitar Center & Rave Motion Pictures.  Food looked Great!! Prices? Didn't look.  Yard House. Get's it's name from the Yard tall glasses you can get a beer in. Looks like a hassle to me.  Definitely hopping place!! And a lot of Tap's to choose from.  I don't know if they have any of their own Brews though. If not, they should. If not I should also deduct a Star.........",

I had a Spaten Optimator, Guinness, Black and Tan, a Dark Castle, and a Warstein Dunkel.  As you can see, they've got a great selection of dark beers.  $3-$4 each, which is great.  Also, my wife and I shared a pretty big appetizer pizza that was, like, $4.   The atmosphere is standard bar/restaurant fare.  They play good music (classic/alternative rock) and it doesn't get too loud.  Make sure you go early to happy hour, or you'll wait for a seat.",

    "text": "Ok so I'm actually a big fan of this place; great happy hour and food is mostly good. So we won a visa giftcard of $100 and decided to celebrate at this yardhouse earlier...everything from the food, drinks, and service was going great until the bill came of $160. Ok so we explained to the waitress to charge $100 on the card and the rest will just be cash of $80 which the change would be her tip...she comes back to us saying the card wouldn't go through because ''giftcards like this takes out a percentage,'' so she claimed she tried swiping $95, $90, $85, and finally the amount of $80 went through. She also said it took out an extra $12 as the ''percentage that goes to the back to the bank.'' we made sure to ask if that $12 goes to her and she said \"NO.\" ok nothing seems to make sense, so I called customer service and they told us that the reason why the amount didn't go through BECAUSE they charged the amount of $115, $113, $110 (so obviously it wouldn't go through BECAUSE the card only contains $100!!!) and that extra $12 was charged as a gratuity for the restaurant, it doesn't go back to the bank merchant...So this waitress PRETTY MUCH LIED to our face not realizing we won't call the customer service of the card!!! They obviously keep track of every single swipe and was able to tell us what amount they charged us. She purposely charged more than $100 into making us think that it won't go through and charged that extra $12 for tip but lying that it doesn't go to her so we can give her more money...that is just plain SHADY! are u freaking kidding me? Why would she lie like that? Has other waiters here done this as their way to pocket more tips? It's not about the amount that gets me, it's this dishonesty that really boggles my mind! It was such a disappointment because she was accommodating but forget that when you're dishonest! Normally patrons would have made a fuss over this but I'm not like that, we just left but I would like to talk to a manager about this tomorrow because that's just wrong. We were willing to give her 25% tip but we're not as stupid as she thought we were so we left. She still got that $12 though so whatever.",

When I asked our waiter if they could turn it down a little so I wouldn't have to shout to converse with my neighbor at the table, he informed me that it was a management decision to have the volume at that level.  Go there if you want a good selection of beers and aren't interested in conversing with your companions, but don't go there if you want the full dinner experience.",

Got some seared Ahi Tuna appetizer and my main course was some jamaican jerk chicken of some sort that had a bunch of shrimp in it as well. It was damn good.    Staff was friendly and even though the place was packed I got seated right away.    They have these 32 oz beers (maybe 24 oz) that come in these super tall 3 foot glasses. There a pain in the ass to actually drink out of but there the most beer bang for your buck I believe.    They have outdoor seating with all these water spigots spraying all over the place but I didn't exactly want that all over my food plus I love the AC so we ate inside.    I got some Spaten Bock and a few other beers I can't remember but they were all good.    I love this joint and I'll be back for sure. The long hallway / fridge with all the kegs you can look at is like a dream come True. You gotta check it out., it's to the left of the front door right after you walk in.",

Because of this little incident I will no longer go there ever again. The hair was baked inside of the pizza and it was a happy hour pizza so trust me, I wasn't trying to get it for free. I had ate one slice as well. I was extremely disappointed that no manager came to say sorry. My coworker paid for her bill and we left.

We would always order the same thing, The happy hour specials. Its too many items to name but you can look it up and see what it is(Pizza, onion rings, sliders, poke, calamari, fries, etc). All of the items were very good and I would say the Bernaise sliders are my absolute favorite. Some would say they are pretty basic, which I agree, they are. But its the mild yogurt-based dipping sauce that they serve with it that gives me an O-Face everytime I take a bite. Im a slider expert and I dont know about yall, but I like my sliders basic(beef, cheese, onions). None of that foie gras, pork belly, cilantro leaves crap. Keep it simple stupid!! I would also always order the same drink, a St Bernardus 13(14% alcohol, yeah buddy!!!) Cant wait to go back, probably wont be for while since monster-in-law and her boy toy broke up. We'll see tho.",

We went here during their happy hour, 3-6 pm Monday-Friday. Appetizers were 1/2 off, as well as beer/martinis. I tried the Pomegranate Martini, which was excellent! I love pom juice, and this drink didn't make my face squint. I couldn't even taste the alcohol! By the end of the night, I had my Asian glow face after a few sips from my glass. GEEZ! It was that good!  For appetizers, my friends and I had an array of different foods: blue crab cakes, ham and pineapple pizza, firecracker wings, buffalo wings, chicken lettuce wrap, garlic noodles, sliders, and spicy tuna roll. All of the appetizers were pretty good.  I was also able to try their Raspberry beer, Lindemans Framboise. It was mighty tasty, and again tasted like juice. I also found out you can make floats out of the draft beers. Maybe the chocolate stout with vanilla ice cream? YUM!  I definitely would come back here and bring another group of friends.   BTW, you can call ahead Thurs-Sun to get a table.",

There is usually a line to get in, but it's only because they are checking IDs and giving you wristbands. The bouncers are pretty friendly, no elitism at this joint, no cover like at Blue Martini which is just upstairs.  Drinks: I seriously think they sell the cheapest drinks at Vegas. I was able to get vodka tonics for just $5 each...seriously? I can get 3 for the price of ONE as compared to one of the pricey clubs on the strip. I didn't really eat a meal here, but I did nibble on my friend's bbq chicken salad, which was delicious. The alcohol I drank induced french fry cravings, so my friend and I split an order of their fries. The fries weren't the big thick fries you get normally, but they were still really good with ketchup and ranch dressing. The wait staff are very attentive and friendly, also very accommodating. We were in a large group on Friday, and they are not allowed to give separate checks, but she had no problem giving me one.  My only gripe about this place is that the music is REALLY loud as it gets later into the night and you have to basically shout across the table to hold any kind of conversation. It's also nearly impossible to find parking around Town Square on Fri and Sat nights, but I guess that comes with the territory. Also, it's kind of hard to walk in and get a table at peak hours, so I would recommend making a reservation for a larger group.  If you are looking for a good place to chill with friends, AND cheap cheap cheap drinks, this is DEFINITELY the place to go.",

I knew that I would enjoy this place immensely.  The Yard House is in a nice location. It's away from the main Strip, down near the airport, but not too far that a taxi ride is too expensive. We didn't check out any of the shops around the restaurant but it did look like somewhere worth coming back to.  We didn't have a reservation, but received a booth with no hassles or wait time. It was a Sunday night and there was a football game on and the restaurant was very busy and noisy, but our waitress told us that everyone usually left as soon as the game finished, which they mostly did. Our waitress was extremely helpful and friendly and gave us some delicious suggestions for beers to try.   For dinner I ordered the Rib Eye, which was delicious and my vegetarian wife had the BBQ \"Chicken\" Salad. There is a massive selection of vegetarian meals on offer here, which apart from the beer was the main reason we came here. Both of our meals were very nice indeed.  After several beers and a perfect amount of food later we left the Yard House very full and very happy. The only downside to the whole night  was that our first very friendly waitress finished her shift shortly after we ordered our first beers. The waitress that took over from her was far from friendly and barely paid any attention to us all night. This wasn't enough to take away from a great night and if we're ever back in Vegas we will definitely be making a return visit here.",

With over 100+ beers on tap I am sure you will find something that ya like.   I strongly recommend coming in during happy hour. Weekdays from 3-7 and 10-close (except for Fridays) means almost all of their appetizers are half off, on top of that, they have $7 sliders, and cheap pizzas as well. The classic rock and continuously flowing drinks make this place a perfect place to hang out and chill if you want to go out with friends.  The food here is usually a step above the bar food found at similar establishments. Yes they do have nachos, pizza, but they have more adventurous fare such as hummus and pita, double stacked chicken enchiladas, tuna tar tar, and so on. I will give them props for food that you wouldn't think they would. But the thing that makes this place amazing, like a few other fellow yelpers mentioned is the... TURKEY BURGER! I don't know what they do to they turkey, but they make it delicious. Succulent turkey paired with herbs, cheeses and thin slithers of roma tomatoes make this one of the best turkey burgers I have had. Definitely give it a try.  Of course one of the coolest things about all Yardhouses is what I call the keg exhibition. Ever Yardhouse has a large room where they store the 100+ kegs in cold ice-cold fridge. Large windows allow pass-er-bys to gawk at the beauties.   The location in Town Square is similar to the other ones around the country. A standard restaurant space consisting of booths and tables. A large central bar in the middle, and a ton of pipes which make the draft beers possible.",

A good loud - because it's hopping with business!    My visit last night gets 4 stars instead of 5 because the service was considerably slow.  The restaurant was full, like always, but the service seemed much slower than ever.  That being said, this place never dissapoints me.    Visited Yard House last night (Friday night around 6:00pm) for drinks and dinner with friends.  Wonderful time with great food and great beer!  I tried a new dish last night and it was YUMMY!  The Chicken Tinga tacos rock!!  But be ready - they are SPICY!  When a beer restaurant can make some of the best tacos in town, you know you are in a special place!   The mexican rice and beans are excellent as well!  It was one of my favorite meals I've had at Yard House - and I've probably had about 25.  I paired my meal with their House Belgium Trippel Ale - which was very good!    The children's menu is very good as well.  We ordered the Mac-N-Cheese for the kiddo, with a side of fruit, and it comes with a drink and an ice-cream dessert for $6.95.  A little on the pricey side of Kids Menus, but the food is top quality kids food!  It's not Kraft macaroni and cheese out of a box - it's homemade with the same cheeses they make the entree meals from.",

I decided to give it a whirl.  We started with the crab/artichoke dip which was pretty good, a bit salty though. The onion rings on the tower were very nice. Fried perfectly and great dipping sauce.  Jambalaya was pretty spicy.  You have your choice of pasta, jasmine rice or brown rice. Comes with peppers, sausage, crawfish, and some giant grilled prawns. I stuck with the pasta. It was tasty. Of like big brewery chains like BJs and Gordon Biersch, this one is probably the best of the pack.",

    "text": "Birthday party on a budget.  Happy Hour half off appetizers and drinks after 10pm, Say What?!  Last night, I joined two of my friends at the Yard House to celebrate one of their birthdays.  I've eaten at the Yard House many o' times  and love the beer choices.  The experience/food is not the worst, but it's not the best.  It's great for happy hour and I'm sticking to that!  For drinks, I just got the Fat Tire pint for about $5.  Although I appreciate the 130+ beer choices, I'm partial to my Fat Tire/Newcastle beers.  For food, we got a few appetizers which were all half off:  First, the  Jamaican Jerk style boneless wings.  Came with a sweet hoisin type dipping sauce. The chicken was tender and the batter was delightful.  Next, we had Moo Shu egg rolls-chicken, chili cream cheese, carrots, green onions, cilantro, spinach with apple ginger plum sauce.  The chicken was a little dry but was redeemed with the sweet plum sauce.  Lastly, we got the chicken nachos-spicy pinto beans, cheddar, jack, red & green sauce, tomato, cilantro, onions, guacamole, sour cream.  It's a huge serving, but just your average bar nachos.  The cheese was a little hard.  I did appreciate the great service that night.  The manager came over a few times, because a drunk lady invited herself on our table and then asked for us to pay her bar tab.  She was a little loud but somewhat funny.  Our server was cordial, but not to impressionable.    The Happy Hour will continue bringing me back to the Yard House.  It isn't busy and we got a table right away.  There's typically a younger crowd which offers a hip vibe in my opinion.  Let's just say that overall, I wouldn't necessarily wait longer than 15 minutes for a table unless you're crazy about beer.",

They put this sweet salsa like sauce on top of the eggs to give it that extra umph. They only give you 3 halves so we were wondering where that 4th half goes off to ;-) The truffle fries were seasoned with herbs and garlic making it the high light of our apps. Pretty dang delicious! The service wasn't all that great but they were very busy and our server did check in with us periodically when she could. I just love coming to Yard House. The atmosphere is something different than what anyone else can offer.    The restrooms were very well maintained as well as the establishment itself. A+ for effort!",

Got a new server, who was very nice, Amalie?? Anyways,  we ended up asking for a manager 30 minutes later because our food was taking over 30 minutes.  He was very polite, made the situation right, got our food out and everything was AWESOME.  Not a good start but things happen, not a big deal. Definitely appreciated the manager, didn't catch his name but everyone and the food were all excellent.  Highly recommend:)))",

A few minutes later, she finally decided to walk towards it after she was done chatting about things that were absolutely not work related.  Once at our table, our magnificently pathetic server didn't even bring the 4 of us waters for a solid and literal 25 minutes. I did however get my beer in the meantime.   We ordered food, and while we were all eating and drinking, the waters still never got refilled but once over a 4.5 hour time span. The waiter went out of his way to avoid our table because I think he acted as if we were way to demanding. I know that getting drink refills and taking food orders is a tough gig, but that's your job.  We asked for our bill to be split between the 2 couples, and ours came out about half correct when he brought it out the first time. Then 5 of my buddies friends walked in the door and stood around to say hi because they'd not seen each other for years. When our waiter came back, I asked him to correct the bill and supplied my card to be charged the correct amount while my friend paid him cash for his portion. When it came back being delivered by another waiter, I'd been charged an 18% gratuity for a tab from a party of 9 (because of the standing friends), and my buddy didn't get anything back!  The waiter had left because the place was closing, that's what he charged, and I was basically told that they didn't have time to remove the gratutiy and that they could charge it even if there was not a group over 8 people, and my friend was out $14 in his change because the guy just kept it.  I'll never go back here again. They were terrible service, and terrible people. If you just did your job correctly in the first place, you wouldn't have to go out of your way to steel your tips from people.",

    "text": "Normally I love going to Yard House and would just stock up on appetizers but this time I decided to order an entree just to try it.  I ordered the \"SEARED SEA SCALLOPS\" which comes with a description of \"orzo pasta with wild mushrooms and white truffle sun-dried tomato sauce\".  Sounded great but was a disappointment when it arrived.  First off, you were given 4 scallops.  Two of which must have been bay scallops and two of which must have been the larger sea scallops.  So the first thing that you noticed was that you received 4 scallops which were not all of the same size but seems to have been cooked for the same amount of time.  Any one that has seared a scallop or eaten a perfectly seared scallop knows that you want a middle that is still slightly translucent.  The two smaller scallops were completely white and over cooked.  The sear on one side too much and the sear on the other side not enough.  With the two larger scallops, it was closer to a perfect sear.  However one scallop was falling apart (bad prep) and almost white on one side receiving no sear at all.  For the orzo pasta, the description indicated wild mushrooms.  I am a huge mushroom fan and love almost every kind that I've had the opportunity to try.  However, I feel that I (as well as most people) probably do not think of button mushrooms or shitake mushrooms as wild mushrooms.    I know that most sun-dried tomatoes are kept in oil to keep them moist.  But when they were added to the sauce, far too much of the reserve oil was added to the sauce.  If I tilted my plate, bright red oil would be able to leak onto the table below.  It was a far to heavy sauce for such a tiny pasta as orzo.  Now I do realize that I am at Yard House and not a celebrity-chef named sea food restaurant, but I would have at least hoped that their entrees would have been as good as all of the appetizers that I've had.  That a chef there would still be able to provide equally sized scallops for one plate and that I would not receive overly greased pasta.  All in all, this will not detour me from returning to Yard House for some apps or a beer but it will detour me from ordering an entree again.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I came to eat here for a celebratory occasion however, I wish we hadn't.   I ordered the small chicken Cobb salad and accidentally forgot to ask them to remove the bleu cheese. Our server Mike was fantastic, he had no problem taking the salad back to the kitchen to remove the cheese. When Mike returned with my salad it looked great, but as I started mixing the salad ingredients together I noticed the hard boiled eggs were grey and the tomatoes the cook served me were all spoiled. I understand that because of my mistake they had to remake my salad all over again but, the cooks should not be allowed to even serve rotten or spoiled food to their customers (especially because the food is being paid for). At this point I had lost my appetite so I asked for the manager, Debbie. I thought the manager was suppose to help solve the issue not treat you like you're ignorant. Debbie said \"that's the color tomatoes are suppose to look like\" implying that I was being scandalous for no reason. I grabbed the fork and tossed the tomatoes over so she could see that the tomatoes were Black. She took the tomatoes to the back to show the kitchen manager & tell them to \"be more careful.\" It just didn't seem like a coincidence that the cooks served me a bad salad after I made them redo it & I emphasized that to Debbie but she was no help. In fact, she made my experience worse by talking to me as though I were a twelve year old. She never returned after she took the tomatoes to the kitchen. Mike was the only person who actually helped, which is why I'm leaving two stars instead of one. Kudos to Mike for working with such immature and unprofessional people. & thank you for not charging us for the salad, I wouldn't have paid for it anyway.",

Some of my favorite food are the Mac & Cheese, calamari, and chicken wings.  There is tons of other good stuff but I can't recall it off the top of my head.    My favorite thing about the yard house though is the music!  Almost every time I'm there, they are blaring classic rock which is awesome!  On the occasions its not classic rock, they play 90's alternative which is my second choice.  Usually places like this play hipster, wub wub, or Justin Beaver type music.  Its nice to have a bar play actual BAR music!  Keep it up Yard House.",

I wouldn't come here just for drinks, or just for the food, or just to eat....come here to eat good food with a huge selection of fairly priced drinks, and plan to be here for a little while.  The service is pretty quick, and a refill of any beverage doesn't take long.  They move around a lot, so it is easy to grab their attention if needed.  The beer selection is one of the best in town, if not the best, and there will be plenty to choose from.  I typically like trying new beers, so I order small sets or their tasting sets to mix the palate.  The food is good...it is not outstanding, but it is good.  Like I mentioned before, treat it like good bar food.  It is good, but I wouldn't come here just to eat...not that noteworthy IMO.  The vibe and atmosphere is cool...a good place to burn a short few hours with friends!",

I have had a few different items here but I always end up getting the mac and cheese squared.  This stuff is a grown edition of the kids meal.  My wife likes to order the  Chilean Sea Bass.  The beer menu can be daunting when you first see it.  Don't worry they offer beer samplers.  The samplers are hit and miss.  One time we went the sampler had 2 different Sam Adams and common hefeweizen.  Sometimes it can have some great selections.  They also have some cool beers blends.  I like to order the Dark Castle which is new castle and Guinness.  So if you have a friend or relative from out of town visiting take them to the Yard House, chances are they don't have one in their town.  Cheers!   Oh and if you go on the weekend, call ahead and reserve a table.  trust me!",

Other dishes were fine (jumbulaya, cheese sandwich w/tomato soup, and orange chicken), but everyone finished their entire plates. We ordered dessert because we were not quite full. Our trio dessert was okay, but my daughter's chocolate dessert was not served warm as described.

Wasn't hungry even though the people around me eating some pretty damn good-looking food.  I was here for the drinks. Do people really drink this early in the day? Hell yes! There is probably one drink that I look forward to the most. Not many people know it, and very few bartenders can make it to perfection.  And it's called the 'LA Water.\"  Soon as I mentioned the name, bartender smiled and handed a glass of one of the best LA Water's I've had. Guess it was a hot day, 'cause I started drinking one after another like nothing. Bartender gave a chuckle and said \"...drinking it down like water.\"  So yes, I was satisfied. Watched the game (USC won of course), burped and tipped the guy $10. I was feeling generous!  Must come back to Vegas just to come back here again.",

Having enjoyed it in CA we thought to give it another try.  This time we took the in-laws in town from the UK.  They were in need of a good pint or two.  Our experience was a lot better this time.  Our server was still a little blah, as if she wasn't comfortable interacting with her tables.  She was fairly competent at least.  The food was good for it being a chain.

Once the new one was brought over to me it was warmer but all that hot however the rest of my party was almost done dining so I choose to keep it. Debbie the manager on duty came over to check on me, which at first I thought was a wonderful touch. At which point she stated to me that the dish was grilled then kept cold and MICROWAVED when ordered and served. I was shocked to hear this, all would have been acceptable with her apologizing but to further explain to me that the meal was microwaved was just beyond me. She did not charge me for the meal but it was too late to save us. The food did not come out in order, one of the members of our party received her meal prior to her appetizer and another member did get the sweet potato fries that they ordered.   Will not go back if I don't have too....",

My favorites are truffle fries, firecracker wings, and onion ring tower. This time we tried ordering something different and got ceviche with tortilla chips and some tacos. Omggggg the ceviche was amazing haha I wouldn't say it's traditional ceviche however, it's more a fusion but nonetheless delicious! The tacos were great as well, they were filled up completely.",

One of my favorite appetizer entree if you will is the Korean BBQ Beef with brown rice and vegetables on the side it's absolutely delicious. Their burgers on a scale of 1 to 10 it's probably a seven out of ten they're ok. The portions are good but the flavors it's okay. My friend had the pastrami sliders which were fantastic he was raving about it the entire time  This place is located in Town & Country Mall right off the highway. The atmosphere is fun and they have a lot of shopping in the area. Again if you're in that area and you want a good environment not too expensive I would hit the Yard House.",

Although it was busy, we were able to briefly look at the menu prior to being seated (to figure out if we really wanted to eat here or not) and when we finally agreed to dine here, we were seated right away. Our waitress was a doll! She was very friendly and attentive to our needs. She also gave great suggestions on dishes to try and was knowledgeable on what was in each dish. The food was AMAZING! I was hella hungry so I ended up finishing my entire plate, plus my sister's plate, had dessert, and still had room for a couple of shots. Hahah! Love it and I would definitely dine here again whenever I'm back in Vegas.",

This tall, male bartender on duty on Sunday, May 15th in the morning is constantly terrible. I've been coming here for years and it always seems like he purposefully ignores me, while moving at the pace of molasses. It's no wonder he gets this terribly terrific shift. I would mention his name, but after being half heartedly served by him on multiple occasions, I can't recall a single time where he smiled at me and told me his name. Normally I would give this place a solid 4 stars. Their food is great and when you get a server who isn't writing it in, every single time, you tend to have a pleasant experience. But this time they, and by they I mean the unnamed bartender, get one star. Good luck with that, Yard House.",

Guacamole is a mix of subtle flavored and textures. This added ingredient is just plain wrong.  The burger I ordered was fine, but without the BBQ or Garlic Aioli. Apparently the server thought that when I asked if the burger had mayo or other spreads, he took it upon himself to have no spreads on the burger. It arrived warm, not hot, likely from sitting in the AC cooled interior of the restaurant.  As for libations, Angry Orchard is still on the menu. My favorite dunkels are gone and apparently never to return.   The sad part about all this, is the state of this poor level of service is consistently prevalent across the chain. For the price of dinner, there are better options. I want it to be better but it just fails in being so anymore.",

The 1 time a month we treat our selves as parents and we get stuck next to a child throwing tantrums and of  course parents not paying attention. i ask my husband if he wanted me to tell the waitress to move us. he said no. by then we have been sitting there for about 5 mins no lie to be greated. we order our drinks and food which thankfully came out quicker than anything.. the food was amazin. the experience not so well. Our waitress was Jennifer and she did not attend to our table at all.     being that is 111 degress out side and not atleast be given water or a \"hey i will be right with you\" and see other waiters and waitresses attend to their tables was sad to say the least. im just here to share my experience. food amazing service not so great. the end",

Probably wouldn't order it again.  Other than that, I'd probably go back to my favorite salad the Ahi Crunchy Salad!  Service was great! Loved that there's all night Happy hour on Monday nights!

I thinking of good place too go hang out have some good food, good beer, television around watch game, and not loud can hang out talk stories catch up. Yard House would be the perfect place although it can be loud. I went on tuesday night so not so bad plus ended up sitting outside on the outdoor cover patio area. It worked out great! =)  I checked in too my surprise the wait was not very long got buzzed less then ten mins. Just first glance the place was packed that night. The server she was great about being patience since cousin guys running late. The first things I LOVE about the YH but at the same time frustrating figure out beer too start the night, The list is so long if there something that not find or something similar too likely would be very surprised. I went with the Kona Brewery Fire Rock Ale. I love my Kona Brewery not only because from Hawaii but good beer! The most common one see is Longboard so saw another one on tap! Hell yay! The rest of the night went with another my favorite Firestone Pale Ale. It another one that hardly see on tap at bars. I love there beer still have since visited Firestone winery.   The food was good as always! It been while but remember the Hawaiian Poke Stack stood out for me. Poke never go wrong in life. I love the way everything balances together. The Poke nice and fresh soy style Poke. The crispy wonton that adds little crispy fried texture plus works out great scoop up all the Poke. The vegetable gives it more depth and flavors too the dish. The wasabi soy drizzle around nice accent too the whole dish. It daunting looking at it start height. Once break down all good stuff. The second app had the bearnaise slider. Honestly not really big fan. I asked the server she recommend as second app. It more miss then hit. The slider meat itself nothing special little dry side. The bearnaise sauce itself nothing special. You combine the sauce with the fried onion on top of the slider and the bun. Ok. Sure pass on sliders plus heavy app start the meal.  I had the Street Taco (Chicken tinga). I wanted too try something different then my last visit. I glad I did! It was awesome. The combination of the chipotle tomatoe sauce plus the feta cheese right balance with spice and cheese. I enjoyed the fact not over stuffed with things in the taco. I added the beans and rice. The rice was tasty stuff. The beans honest never got too because the beers and apps all stuff.   Dessert my cousin and I split a Lemon Souffle off our sever recommendation. She got right on. It was not your traditional souffle. That it would be bursting like ballon out of the dish. It smaller portion really for one. Dessert we were all pretty full but try something sweet. It was just right amount of lemon and whipping cream or ice cream on top. It perfect dish too end the night. Good good, good times, and family!!",

This is a place I plan on going back to repeatedly and would highly suggest it if you don't mind a potential wait.",

Got the Smores Brownie. We ordered 2 and the server only bought out one. He admitted to making a mistake but I actually thanked him because 2 would have been way too much. I ordered it with a side of chocolate mint ice cream. Delicious!   2 stars for the overall seating situation. They weren't that busy (MANY visible tables open) and they took 45 minutes to seat a table of 6. I was disappointed with that.   Overall good experience. I definitely recommend going. Hopefully you get seated sooner to enjoy the good food.",

I will on occasion go to the red rock location if I'm in that area. But town square is the go to.   Every time I come, it's usually always busy. Meaning I've never come on an empty night. Still receive great service and seated within an acceptable amount of time. There are great for large parties! ***side note: if you have a large party, be patient with them some servers look and act annoyed** I've come in with a party over 30 and they always accommodate us. (We come after we  perform in shows)   Like I said I love the reverse happy hour menu so honestly that's the only things I've ever tried... And their dessert! Yummy! My absolute favorite is the Garlic Chicken Noodle!!! I see it more as a meal than an appetizer! Lo mein type noodles with chicken chunks accompanied by garlic flavor, edamame seeds, Parmesan cheese toppings, shiitake mushrooms, chunks of tofu, and sliced asparagus!!! Who wouldn't love that?! It's absolutely delicious and just the right amount of garlic flavor.   All of their happy hour appetizers are a must try. Their half off pizzas are delicious, and my other favorite go to meal is the Ahi-poke Stack. Perfectly lightly wasabi coated ahi tuna chunks stacked on wonton wafers accompanied with carrot and radish slices all lightly coated in the soy and wasabi ginger sauce with slices of fresh avocado on the side!!    When I order just the chicken garlic noodles and the poke stack during happy hour, with tip and tax included I walk out paying $15. Can't beat that!!!   Not to mention to amazing beer selection they have available!! Pear Cider is my go to!   Try everything on their appetizer menu! I promise they do not disappoint",

This place is definitely good for beer but only affordable during the happy hour. It feels like their food has gone downhill.  The shortys are not included in the happy hour. Well you can get them but there it's no discount. I asked our waitress if they were included in the happy hour and she replied \"yes\". We then ordered two to go along with our eats. When the bill came I looked at it and noticed the shortys were the same price as in the menu. I asked our waitress about this b/c of what she has stated earlier. She said \"oh yeah, they are included in the happy hour...But are regular price.\" I was dumbfounded by her answer. Is it just me or does that sound like they are NOT included in the happy hour after all? I'm just saying... Other then that the service is good here, tons of TV's everywhere. Kids can come hang and it's an overall good, fun and welcoming environment. Worth the visit for their massive beer selection on tap. I wish they had done court of stamp card so I could keep track of every beer I've had there.",

We ended up getting sat outside, which we didn't ask for but hey, I was starving so we sat, ordered and food got there in decent time. I ordered the beef dip and is was phenomenal. I got the salad instead of fries and it was actually pretty good. I was expecting iceburg lettuce with an under ripe cherry tomato but it was much better than that. All in all, I'd go back just to sample the beer and grab that beef dip again. I take a star off because it felt too touristy for me...I'm more of a locals only dude",

I ate here on friday night with a mixed tables of locals and visitors- everyone was pretty satisfied with their meal and the dinner was impeccable.  On the other hand, the douche factor is through the roof: tons of ed hardy and ladies rocking the high heels/shorts look.  I think they actually charge a cover on friday and saturday night?  I know they have a similar scene at the San Diego Yard House, but I literally can not fathom why people would come here on a friday or saturday night.",

Since we were starving and wanted to get out of there quick we opted to be split into 2 groups.  If you're visiting Vegas and staying on the strip going here might be a little costly taxi wise because it is a bit off the strip.",

My girl loves cider and enjoy the raspberry Wyders that's on tap. We were here for a friend's birthday party, so our group was pretty large. The service was lacking and they were slow to bring our drinks, food and checks towards the end, but all in all they were able to acommodate our very large group.

The food probably tastes so good because it is really unhealthy for you though, definitely lots of salt or sauces on all the dishes I've ever had. Don't come here expecting culinary nirvana, its just a really good sports bar.  Make sure you hit Happy Hour during the day, M-F 3PM - 6PM and Sunday - Wednesday 10PM - close. You can get appetizers and beers much cheaper, then order your entree right at 6:01. Work the system people!!! It's a recession.",

I used my napkin on my glass and requested a new one.  Our server took our orders. When I ordered (Mac and cheese)2 our server asked if I knew what truffle is. I responded that I do he said \"and you like that?\" in a condescending tone. Again yes, then he said \"ok you'll you  like it then\". After a long wait our entrees were brought out... No appetizers. When I inquired about our appetizers the girl rolled her eyes and left.  Still waiting.... I asked for server. After a bit I saw the manager and called him over. He told me the server forgot to put in the order for the appetizers. That he would make sure entrees were remade.  Finally we got food...it was good. The manager stopped by to check on us but we noticed he didn't stop by any other table.  They did in the end comp the meal but no one ever apologized for our negative experience.  As we were walking out the door the hostess yelled \"have a good one\"",

I ordered the angel hair pasta, my bf ordered the dip with a side of sweet potato fries and our friend ordered a grilled chicken sandwhich with broccoli. When all of our orders came out, I tried the fries and they were cold. I mentioned it to my boyfriend and when he touched his sandwhich, it was also cold. I thought that was a bit weird, but when my friend took a bite if his sandwhich he said his chicken was also cold. I was thinking, maybe because it's a sandwhich, it wouldn't be that warm even though my bf ordered the roast beef dip. So, I took a bite of my pasta and my pasta was dry, bland, and COLD. It seemed like they left it out for a long time because the pasta was kind of stale. It was by far the worst meal I have eaten. No one in my party enjoyed their cold food. The food is over priced and they serve cold food. What I did notice yesterday night because I was sitting in front of the kitchen, was the food was coming out fast, but the food was standing there forever. I saw 4 dishes waiting there to be picked up for roughly 10 min. No wonder the food was getting cold! Not enough runners to even bring the food out. Horrible way to manage a business that can't have enough staff to bring out orders. I will never return here for the food. Like a huge company like this, they should have already gotten their shit together. Horrible.",

Does the fact that it is the first visit or the 115th visit make a difference to them? And why does the server ask if you want another round when we have barely taken 2 sips from the first beer? What's the hurry? Are you running a fast food joint? Who's your biggest competition - Taco Bell? As a whole, the food is great, but the staff could use some common sense and a bare minimum of social skills. I'd say the beer is great, but not to their credit. Anyone can buy a keg and tap it.",

The beers here are magnificently cheap, depending on which you order of course, but its definitely in an affordable range. If you're looking for an adventure to venture away from the general beers of Bud Light and Corona, they have a variety of different beers from different countries... on tap. Yes, you heard me right. On tap.   I only tried the ahi and the flatbread with artichoke dip, which wasn't that bad (flatbread and artichoke is beginning to be a little more redundant for an appetizer meal nowadays, but the ahi was seasoned and seared deliciously!) It was only a Wednesday night and the bar was crowded and lively. This is definitely my place in town to where I want to go for beer that's from different countries and you don't need to feel like you're getting ripped off like you would at other places on The Strip.",

The chicken fried chicken is seriously one of the best I've ever had (and I was raised in Texas) but the Mac and cheese was greasy and gross. Their beer is great but don't buy a cocktail, they are all ice and seriously weak. Truth be told, if I'm going to be eating in town square I'd rather eat cheaper and buy something or get drunk.   It's very crowded on the weekends and not worth the wait. Also, the pizza tastes like cheap dijiorno.   Tl;dr; food's overrated, beer great. Not worth line.",

Save for the fact that they don't have chicken wings :(  I got the steak and shrimp...steak was tougher than shoe leather. Didn't finish it. Shrimp were cooked right and the green beans were good.   Mom got grilled cheese & tomato soup.  Hard to mess this up but I'm sure someone can. She was happy. Tomato soup there is really good.  Dad was the winner, he go the turkey pot pie. Thing was amazingly huge and was very tasty. I'd hate to see the calories in the thing but he was happy.  Lobster mac-n-cheese is amazing there.  Another friend got the thai chicken pizza, it was ok, but was lacking flavor in my opinion. I mean, it is Thai after all.",

But on a normal basis, happy hour is effective from 3:00 PM - 6:00 PM M(maybe Sunday included)-TH, and 10:00 PM - Close Sun - Wed.  Half off select appetizers which consists of most appetizers. My personal favorite is the Chicken lettuce wraps.  Bernaise Sliders for the win as well. Most if not all sliders are $6.95 during happy hour. Pizza is half off as well.  Yard House is a dim-lighted atmosphere consisting of great service from all servers.   I don't normally order my alcohol from here because I prefer to fulfill my satisfaction with food rather than liquor but they have a huge selection of beer and discounted happy hour prices for most liquor as well.  Be warned though, this is not the place to come to if you're on a diet. I feel that they put tons of salt and sodium in all their food. Which is probably why I'm always in a food coma when I leave this joint. But if you're all about happy hour and binge eating, then swing on by!",

Also, we would have to ask for everything!! refills, take empty plates out the way, we would need the check and etc. the most disappointing part about this whole visit was that in the very begging I asked him to please bring a cake out to our table when it came close to finishing up our meal. Not only did it take for ever for us to get to go boxes an the check he forgot about the cake!!! My 9 year old niece understood things happen sometimes (birthday girl), which was ok. but I was more upset at the fact that he asked me right before he dropped the check if we were ready for him to bring out the cake... he never brought it!!!The cake never came out!! Which should've been no surprise because he had an attitude the whole time. I also work in the food n bev industry so I always understand if it is busy how it can be overwhelming for the server. It was not busy when we were dining in at all! Only reason I'm giving it a one star is because the food was actually good. Sergio is a horrible server. With no patience, attitude problem, and lack of menu knowledge. No longer will I arrive to this location. Btw if Sergio doesn't like his line of work than maybe it's time for him to get diff job.

I was about disappointed in the options I was left with as I don't consume much meat but pleasantly surprised they offer gardein food! Not too many places would take the effort in including this in their menu and I strongly applaud Yard House for doing so. That said their food is always amazing and the dining options in door and out door at the Yard House in Town Square is great! The atmosphere is always friendly and I never feel uncomfortable around their wait staff.",

    "text": "We ended up at Yard House because the silly Blue Martini Lounge does not allow camouflage shirts. Frankly, I am glad we ended up at the Yard House because they are one of the most consistent chain restaurants in the business. Plus, they have a 100+ beers on tap which is pretty darn cool. The staffs are usually fast and attentive.   If you like a menu with a lot of variety I definitely think you'll like this place. The menu offers American food, Mexican food, Italian food and some Asian Fusion selections. I ordered the chicken enchiladas and it was very delicious. The combination of the green and red sauce on it was amazing. The street tacos there are also fun to eat and share as an appetizer. I also recommend the beer sampler.   All in all, the food is also consistent along with their customer service. It's also a great location to catch a game or if you just want a quick drink at the bar. I will definitely be back for another round. Thanks, Yard House Town Square.",

    "text": "The unmatched draft beer list is something that always draws me to any Yard House. We used to flock to this location for happy hour at the bar after work. The perimeter of the center bar was roped off like it still is now and we would stand in this roped off area crammed butt to nut, with the entire area around the bar lined with people three deep not able to move or hear any conversation while everyone still tried to act cool.  Nowadays, I just go with my family for maybe a beer or two and for dinner. We came on our most recent visit on Saturday night with about a five minute wait. We sat inside at a booth with a ten top table next to us and an overall very noisy restaurant. Quarters are much tighter in this location compared to others.  We were served by Victor who did a fine job despite being busy, but also taking time to make my daughter and her friend laugh along with bringing the entire table water without request. We started off with the shrimp ceviche and nachos. The nachos were a nice portion and loaded with plenty of chicken, beans, cheese. I wasn't that pleased with the ceviche as the mango papaya salsa was too sweet and overpowered the dish hiding the traditional tart flavor of a ceviche.  For entrees, I ordered two tacos, fish and pork belly, which I preferred the pork belly. And also ordered were a chicken Cobb salad and mini creme brulee for dessert. The Cobb salad was nice sized portion with plenty of ingredients and big enough for my daughter and her friend to split. The bananas topping the custard on the creme brulee were also hit by the torch giving them a bit of candied texture also.  The menu is large at Yard House with some items done well, but nothing exceptional. This location isn't as family friendly as other locations due to the louder environment and with a clientele that favors groups that are there hopping between other bars in Town Square. I would come back to this location with my friends during one of the early or late happy hours to sample the discounted beers and while munching on some food.",

In fact, I was like wow this guy moves quick, but is never flustered, and manages to have such a positive attitude. My fiance was impressed as well.

We arrived around 730 and had a 30 minute wait which I expected considering it was a Friday night.    I started with the chicken nachos which was outstanding!  Chips topped with some kind of house BBQ or picante sauce, shredded cheese. Chicken (cooked well), guacomole, sir cream, tomatoes, cilantro.... Everything you would expect to make a great nacho plate. It was pretty large also, feeds 4 at least.   My entree, I decided to go with the chicken and rice bowl.  It was pretty good, flavorful but the chicken was a little dry and could've used a little more seasoning.  If this dish would've been a little better I would've considered giving them a 5 star.  It was an reasonably priced as well. Those two items totaled to $30.",

    "text": "Yard house is a very reliable choice if you are at Town Square. Town Square is one of the more popular malls off the strip in Vegas and it attracts both tourists and locals in roughly equal amounts with an abundance of shopping, entertainment, and restaurants. Of all of the restaurants I would say Yard House is the one I attend the most.  Environment: The interior of the restaurant is rather large and spacious and you can expect that it will almost always be reasonably full. However despite the busy atmosphere I have rarely had to wait more than 10 minutes to be seated. They have both inside and outside creating as well as a rather large bar, however I usually opt to sit inside taking in account Vegas' weather. My only qualm with the interior would be the lighting which is very dim.  Food: The menu can be considered as American but they do have influences from many different genres of food. Asian, Italian, and Latin influences can be found in the menu so you can enjoy sashimi, pasta, and tacos at your leisure. Some of my favorite dishes are: Poke Stack: The cubes of Ahi tuna are very fresh and the sliced serrano peppers give it a nice spice. Vodka Shrimp Pasta: Very creamy and flavorful with a hint of spice and good helping of shrimp. Fried Calamari: I love calamari and whenever I get it here it is crispy without being overly breaded. They also include both the legs and the rings which I appreciate and a lot of lemon too.  The drinks are also good, whether it be their extensive beer menu, or my favorite cocktail, the Yuzu gin cooler.  Service: Service is typically good, albeit a little slow. However due to the busy nature of the restaurant the waiters try their best to be attentive but they get some slack too.  Overall I would definitely recommend Yard House to anyone at Town Square, they are open late and have a great happy hour too!",

We were seated immediately by a nice hostess without having to wait. Not too long after we sat down, we were greeted by Erika! She was so friendly, fast, and attentive..even with the place being quite busy. My guy got the jumbo shrimp with Indonesian rice and spinach and I got the fish of the day which was the tombo, served with white rice, broccoli, pesto, mango chutney, and another sauce which I don't remember...sorry!  Moving on, the shrimp dish was excellent! The rice had a lot of flavors and the sauce they had for the shrimp was a wee spicy..yum! The fish on the other hand, was over done and came out a little dry. So we informed Erika, and bam! No problem! She was so sincere and I actually felt bad that I had to send it back, but the guy insisted. They actually gave me a new plate with the perfectly done fish and once again, Erika was there to make sure everything was right! She also made sure our glasses of water never went empty! We finished off the meal with a chocolate souffle and as usual, it was deelish! The whole meal cost us 69 bucks and we made sure we left our server with more than 20 percent!   Great food, excellent service, equals a great night at Yardhouse!",

    "text": "...For the record, I have never posted a negative review online...This evening I decided to eat at this Yardhouse location, but the experience was traumatic. Between California and Nevada, I have eaten at this restaurant at least a few dozen times, and general eat the same few options. Getting to the point, upon arrival of the main course, i saw a dark piece of something poking out of the breading of my chicken fingers. Considering I eat these almost every time I eat at Yardhouse, dismantling deemed appropriate. I pulled the breading off and discovered a cockroach /bug type wing and a limb on an insect. The food runner was notified of the incident, and attempted to take the plate back. I denied him, took a photo and requested a manager. The manager (Beau Boskey) assured me it was cabbage, but also denied eating it upon request. At this point, he offered to take that dish off the bill, and shrugged off the entire situation as a misunderstanding. He entirely discrediting my opinion, and I'm a collector of  scientific insect displays. Kind of ironic. Our server came over and apologized about the whole situation. We understood it wasn't her fault, but did let her know that the manager handled the situation wrong(she was tipped). She apparently notified him of my dissatisfaction and conversation of taking this to his upper management/corporate. After Beau, the manager, caught word, he decided to retract his original offer and comp the whole meal. This attempt to appease me was an appropriate gesture, a bit late and an obvious back step. Overall, this restaurant experience will never be forgotten... in a bad way. .........By the way... I looked up deep fried cabbage on google image search and my photo looks very different. gross.  3/22/13 Update- I was recently offered a free meal and assurance that my experience is going to be used as a training exercise. Obviously, I'll never eat at this place again, and hopefully they figure out how to deal with these situations better in the future.",

They also have my favorite beer (hoegaarden w/lemon- if you like hefe-weizens, you should try it).  It can get overly crowded, and there's usually a long wait for tables. The food is good, but the bar crowd will definitely spill over into the dining section.  For the most part the staff is friendly, and more down-to-earth than the average vegas place.",

I wasn't sure where I was at because I was hungover but i quickly was filled with excitement and joy. It doesn't get much better than those three things for a man.   We went here for lunch and the hostess asked us which game we wanted to watch because they seat you where the specific game is being played on their plethora of TVs. They usually try to get you in a spot so you can view most of the games.  We all got burgers and everyone seemed to like them. My mouth was watering from all of those taps behind the bar but my brain was saying no go. My liver would just have to wait until next time to try all of that deliciousness. The waitresses were nice, friendly, and funny and made the experience that much better.  I wish they would put on of these up north but the next time I am in Vegas this is where the night will start off.",

Service is excellent @ the bar, very attentive, Managers were visible & involved w/ every guest.  Excellent location in the Quad courtyard next to O'Shea's.  I need to check out a few more craft beer spots on the Vegas Strip, but so far this one is the best.",

    "text": "I was surprised that I haven't written a review for the Yard House...weird.   Well to sum it up, this latest visit to the Yard House was for a close friends Birthday Dinner. I was only expecting five people or so, but she reserved almost 20 some-odd seats!!! So good to know that the Yard House does take reservations in advance for such a huge party.  The party didn't start off as planned since the birthday girl was nearly two hours late for her own party!! lol. However, thank goodness for the large LCD TV screens plastered on every inch and corner of this place, we were able to kill the time, starting with some drinks and enjoying Sunday Night Football at the same time...so it all didn't go to waste :) The beer selection is AMAZING! They dedicate a whole two pages of the menu just for the beer, I've also seen Beer Floats and I have yet to try one. If you don't want to spend full price on alcoholic beverages, they have Happy Hour from 10pm-Close.   The Yard House...its an interesting restaurant. The ambiance in this place is...well....AMAZING!? ha ha. It's weird, you sit there at your table and the lighting is dim and serene, yet at the same time, with the LCD Screens and the bar smacked right in the middle of the restaurant, it's also like a pub! So...like a high class restaurant/Pub/Sports bar/Lounge? Does this make any sense? Because I'm just typing away and totally going off subject..........  Food! I usually start off with the Calamari, the baby-squid type, not that O-ring type! Yum Yum....and my main dish is always the Crab Crusted Swordfish on Wasabi Mashed Potatoes. Absolutely amazing! The swordfish is cooked just right, every time I have ordered this dish, and not once was the fish over cooked. Its pretty pricey, $23.00 (give or take), but the portion is well worth your money! :) However this time I decided to try something else and a bit lighter. Since i filled my body with a lot of alcohol for the night, something big would get me sick so I decided to order something small. So I figured an appetizer, that's small enough right? I ordered the Ahi Poke Stacker which was $11.95. Ahi Poke is cubed raw tuna tossed in a mix of soy sauce, sesame seed oil, onions, limu, green onions. I grew up on this stuff, so I was quite curious of the Yard House's recipe. I was VERY satisfied. When I received my plate, first layer was ahi poke, then a layer of \"fried something\", next topped with seasoned sauteed Carrots, another layer of  the fried \"crispy something\", topped with more poke. It was light, refreshing, and absolutely delish!!! The taste was just as amazing as its presentation. :) My new favorite dish! Don't forget to finish off with the Kona Coffee Sundae for dessert, it's quite big, so you can share with a friend or significant other!   Usually with big groups, taking orders could be tricky. It makes sense for a group of 14, to assign two waiters to take orders. After that experience, unless the two waiters can communicate good, its not a good idea. Problems such as taking double orders (esp with drinks..) not cool! But it was all squared away with no problems. Other than that the waiters were on their game and totally cool!",

After we had the wrong order sent back it was returned cold !

I am in the service industry and it seriously takes a lot for me to complain or even get on Yelp and write a review but someone who is in management should lead by example! This was absolutely disgusting the way we were treated ! If management can treat guest that way than all employees at this establishment can and that is a disgrace . If you hate your job leave !

I run restaurants and I would hire Adam in a hot second!   I had the garlic noodles, as I always do and tomato bisque soup.  My safe go to meal.  On the table we also had a roast beef sandwich; my mom loved it.  Mac and cheesex2 which my fiance loves and gets from time to time.  The final dish was stacked chicken enchiladas, the looked great!! I was really impressed with the presentation.  There was also 2 bowls of clam chowder and 1 french onion soup on the table, everything was gone by the end of the meal!.   Adam checked on us many times, made small talk and joked with us through out the meal.  He gets 5 stars.  I would give the whole thing 5 stars but the beer we ordered was flat, or it was at the end of the keg. Now not to brag but I know beer, its part of my job to know beer, even the beer tap systems. And it isn't the first time that has happened to me there.  Any-who; Adam did get us a different beer and it was fine.  We will be back, next time for happy hour, they have great deals!",

It's usually always busy around dinner and as for staffing, if you really pay attention there's so many of them! Service is consistent. Sometimes we have a super attentive server or not that much.  Food is usually always slow to come out.   They definitely like to pace out your time. They welcome you ask for drinks and leave. Then they come back with drinks and ask for appetizers. You kind of have to tell them that you're overall just ready to order or not.  Our server was really patient with us. We were just so caught up in conversation we barely looked at the menus lol. Sorry!   Food is always good! Almost everything I've ordered here, I've enjoyed. I love their gardein selection, how amazing it tastes. Just don't look at the calories lol  Pricing is affordable, not too expensive and not cheap.   They do have happy hour which has great selection.  Of course their beer selection is amazing.   If you walk to the bathrooms you can see through the window all the kegs.   My favorites are gardein chicken with buffalo, gardein orange chicken, crab cakes, buffalo cauliflower. My friends really liked the lobster dip and the regular chicken wings.  I know that onion ring tower is massive and the sauces make it yummy.   Overall I always have a great experience here with friends and family.  They made my friend feel special because it was her birthday!",

    "text": "\"Yard House, what you've just served is one of the most insanely terrible things I have ever had. At no point in my failed dining experience were you even close to anything that could be considered a good meal. Everyone in my group is now worse off for having eaten it it. I award you no stars, and may God have mercy on your soul.\"  I have no idea how this place has such great reviews. This was by far the worst meal I have had since moving to vegas and I am going to tell you why. It was busy, which was to be expected as it was Feb 15, the day after V-day so we sat outside. It was cold so we moved tables as soon as the one by the fireplace left which was much warmer! Our server came over and was super nice! He had an east coast accent and took our order for drinks bringing us water right after. We ordered a few apps to share since we were starving.  We had 2 double Jameson's neat, and a double old fashioned. We really were looking to warm up. The drinks came, and one friend joked wow, that is neat, and slim as it look like maybe 2oz of whiskey. I tried my old fashioned and nearly spit it out, it was bad! Then the food started coming... such terrible food. One of my 'mates is the happiest nicest dude in the world and always jokes about me having the worst luck. He thought I was exaggerating until he tried it then agreed that it was a really bad old fashion.  --Chicken nachos- Cold, so cold that the cheese wasn't melted.  --Calamari- probably the best thing we had, since it was average.  --Lobster dip- Bland, and the chips were terribly salty. The best part was the pita bread which ended up being my favorite thing that night, plain pieces of pita bread. --Carnivore pizza- overly salty and generic. Reminded me of those frozen tony's combo pizzas I used to eat in High school  When our server asked how things were I said \"The cheese isnt melted and this is the worst old fashioned I've ever had\" as I was in a bad mood at this point. He went on to talk about different bourbons and my friends were just as confused as I was. We realized after he walked away that he probably thought I was kidding since we had good rapport so far.   The service was actually pretty decent. Our server was great, and a girl with glasses helped on occasion as they were sharing a large party table next to him. A blonde manager in a white blouse did come over to clean up some of the plates but never asked us how our meal was which kind of shocked me. In the end only the service was good and we did hear the table next to us complain about how long it took for them to get their food which one of the other servers said they were having problems in the kitchen. We were at table 132 and our servers name was Robert.   At this point we were freezing and pissed because none of us enjoyed our meal. Then the bill came and it was $117, or 39 each plus an 8 dollar tip. Over 20% because again, our server was very nice and seemed to be having a rough night with the young party next to us. But after that, I realized for $48 I could have treated my group to Denny's, and had a better meal. For $48 each we could have gone to Oyshi all you can eat sushi and had to decanters of large apple sake'. For $48 I could have had like 20 tacos at tacos el gordo! For $48 I could have gone back to Rodizios Brazilian BBQ and had their fresh juice long island again with a full meal! The more I think about how badly I felt ripped off for one of the worst meals I have ever had, the more mad I get. Thanks again Yard House for a terrible dining experience.",

However, I don't know if it was today's cook/chef, but the calamari appetizer seemed a bit overcooked and dry.  The burger I ordered (truffle burger with aioli spread) was cooked medium, which I ordered, but I haven't been to a Yard House where the bun is bigger than the burger. Plus the fries on my plate looked like they were a half order. That has never happened before.  My wife's Nashville hot fried chicken sandwich was smaller than normal as well.   Usually I don't have any gripes with the portions at a Yard House, but for some reason, this particular location was different, especially for the prices being paid.  Hopefully, this was just an isolated incident.  I'll have to come another day when I return.",

    "text": "My husband and I came on a Monday for date night. We chose to come to the one on the strip because we need to cash some chips at the flamingo. I forget how some places can get so packed dinner time in the strip. They told us it would be about a 45-60min wait for a table. I decided to take a chance and scope around the bar. And what do you know, hidden open seats. We got lucky! The bar was packed as well as the restaurant but always check the bar if you don't want to wait.   We order the spicy garlic edamame as an appetizer. It was a little bland. I had to add a little bit of salt. My husband ordered the ahi tuna sandwich but instead of Fries he subbed for a kale Caesar(did not get a photo). I ordered the ahi crunch salad. Omg, the salad was soooo good! We were skeptic about dessert because we have had it in the past and it wasn't great but it was delicious and they redeemed themselves this time! It was a trio dessert consisting of peach cobbler, chocolate souffle, and cheesecake!   If I had to tell anyone to try something it would be the ahi crunch salad and dessert!",

It's my ultimate favorite even though I can never remember the name of it. Haha.  The selections are amazing, especially if you're into beers.  The servers and staff are all very friendly and accommodating, although they can be very busy at times and you may find yourself wondering when they'll visit your table again. The place gets really busy sometimes, so I get it.",

I enjoyed the casual vibe of the restaurant and also had fun tracing the pipes on the ceiling. There's TVs around just in case I don't feel like talking to the people I brought with me.  Overall I would say give this place a try. There's a reason why they're always packed.",

We sat down and were immediately greeted by our server Celal. This guy was great. He was on top of the drinks all night. I never went below half full on my drink. He was very knowledgeable about the menu and was quick to answer any questions we had. I ordered the ribeye steak, medium, with a salad and broccoli. The steak was cooked to perfection and was a delight. The garlic butter really kicked up the flavor of the already well seasoned steak. Other members in my party had the poke bowl and the sirloin steak. No complaints at all. In making the poke bowl keto, the rice was removed. Worried about making sure there was enough food, he offered a side to go with it without charge which was great. Overall the experience was one I wish to duplicate in the future. I will always ask for Celal.",

We waited for about 20 minutes then I called the server again and he said he would check on our order. After that waited for another 10mins, I saw our server taking a group of girls orders. I saw other tables he was assigned too that were seated after us getting their orders. I attempted to get his attention and he once again said that he will check on our order. We then waited for another 20 minutes for our food. Well we didn't get our food so we decided to leave and take our service somewhere else.   We usually do not ask for much as customers, but we do expect just to update us and receive what we ordered. This why I gave this spot a 1 Star. We just wanted to have the server give us our food and communication. We do not want to feel like we are being ignored as we did today.",

No one was sitting near us as we were outside so I'm 90% sure it was a busser and/or server who took them. Manager didn't do anything but take my number and say he'd call me if they popped up. Ridiculous. No where they could have gone in 2 minutes and didn't talk to busser or anything.",

    "text": "Came with a party of 14 for dinner on a busy Friday night in April at 7:00pm. We had two servers, both were great. Ashley serviced our end of the table and she did a great job, we had three kids in our party and the other server thoughtfully took their orders first since the adults were chatting over drinks and appetizers. We were celebrating a birthday and the other server brought out the birthday cake our party brought and Ashley gave us plates and a knife to cut the cake and boxed it when we were done. I'd been to Yard House at Town Square before, and it delivered the same great experience - sports on the multiple tvs, packed restaurant and bar, knowledge staff and great service.   I give it two stars because my dinner entree was incredibly disappointing. I ordered the cilantro lime shrimp with tabouleh salad and will be honest, I was expecting a more substantial portion for $16.00. What I was served however, was five shrimp, a smear of hummus underneath the shrimp and a large scoop of tabouleh salad over two mid-sized romaine leaves. The (luke-warm) shrimp was very tasty and the chilled salad was fresh, but the five shrimps on the plate were not prawns, they were medium-sized shrimp and I was not expecting there to only be five of them. I was famished and this was not the dinner entree I had expected.   Quite frankly, I would have expected such an \"artful nouveau\" $16.00 rectangular-plated item at a different type of restaurant, not at a loud sports bar type joint. (See my picture)  Next time I will stick to their large Cobb salad or Turkey burger with a cup of soup.   Or I wont come hungry or skip the appetizers.",

A few minutes later the waiter brought over a paper bag and said it was in there and ready to go. I got home and realized it was only a couple of spoon fulls. I was shocked.

The past 2 visits, I ordered the Maui chicken dinner, and it's delicious!  The chicken is sort-of bone it, the breast and wing are attached to one another, but the rest of the bones are removed, making it simple to cut through the breast with ease.  The sauce and grilled pineapple skewers on top make this dish a killer!  They offer an excellent selection of craft brews, along with your traditional faves.  Definitely a must-go whenever I'm in Vegas!",

We sat down ordered our food got our soups and appetizers pretty quickly. It was the entrees that took an hour after our appetizers to get to us. We were talking and didn't even realize that we hadn't gotten our food until we looked over and a party of 8 that sat down before us got up and was leaving. We flagged down the server who was very apologetic and he got the manager and they said something had messed up in the kitchen. By that time we didn't even want our food but the manager really made up for it and he has amazing customer service skills  I will definitely be back solely because of Jose!!",

The burger came out really hot and it burned my mouth since i took a fatty first bite.  It comes with mushrooms and baby spinach which i love and the size of the patty was nice and thick.  I ordered it medium and it was perfect.  Sometimes when i order medium rare it comes all too soft and the burger ends up falling apart.    The only downside to this burger is that the bun is a little tough and its a little pricey.  Other than that, it was goooood.",

The first time I tried this restaurant was a few years back, and I absolutely love it.  If you love beer and some great food, you must try this place.  They serve fresh fish every day and it's cooked to order.  We always have the fresh fish when we eat dinner there.  Lunch time is usually something else, like their mac n cheese squared or some sliders.  What I enjoy about this place is their variety of foods, from american to asian.    Want to save money and still eat well?  Their appetizers could be a meal in itself!  They are huge portions and things like chicken strips come with fries, anyway, so you can always order a beer and save money on the food. I really do love eating here and haven't tried everything on the menu yet.  I'm looking forward to more culinary adventures here soon!  Some great tips: always ask your server about their favorite beers, or what beer they prefer from lagers, stouts, etc.  They are well versed in their beer and usually their preference is really good.  Another thing--their portions are big, so if you're a small eater order one dish for 2 people.  Seating can take awhile in the evenings, so coming in around 830/9pm may help seat you sooner.  If you want to eat dinner between 5-7 and you can't find parking, just use the valet right next to the restaurant side of town square.  It's open till the early morning and saves tons of time on finding that open space.",

    "text": "I love The Yard House. It's a sports/beer bar, but it's not tacky, or like some kind of man cave, in fact, the Yard House seems to be able to pull off a super chill, highly relaxed atmosphere that feels classy and fun. Lots of big TVs everywhere, any game you could want to watch, with a dimly light atmosphere. YH has more beers on tap than you could ever hope to drink in your visits there.   Just like their sort of combination feel (nicer bar/restaurant- awesome sports bar) they've managed to do something similar with the menu. Normally, Im a fan of restaurants not trying to do too much, and sticking with a few things that they know how to do well, but this place apparently knows how to do it all well. We came during happy hour and had cheap drinks, and half priced appetizers, firecracker wings, onion rings, poke stack and crab cakes. All were absolutely fantastic. Especially the wings.   Unlike most sports bars, this place has never been incredibly loud, the way most sports bars are. Great atmosphere, awesome food, attentive staff, badass place to watch a game.",

I never seem to make it for happy hour so the bill can get kind of pricey but overall its a nice place to chill, drink, and get some noms.  The biggest draw back to hanging out there is its always LOUD. I don't think i've ever been there and had a normal toned conversation with my guest. The music is usually loud which means the patrons have to be louder just to be heard. It can get almost obnoxious at times.  That's the only reason why they get a 4 star review.

    "text": "I've been to Yardhouse several times. I like that they have so much beer on tap. My wife enjoys the Rose Gaarden (a mix of framboise and Hoegaarden that is really honestly delicious) and I usually go with the Rogue Hazelnut brown.  The food has always been solid. The (mac + cheese)^2 is usually good, the hawaiian poke stack is always tasty (their tuna in general is pretty nice), and they can cook a good burger. So why the three stars?   Well, we brought some guests here and found ourselves sort of embarrassed. To be fair, it was a Saturday night and they were very, very busy, but our waiter (Ryan) stood out as rude enough that our guests actually commented on it afterwards.  Lest you think I'm being unfair, here's specifically what went wrong, in order.  We had a party of six and were seated at a round table set for five. The host said he'd have us an extra chair in \"just a second,\" after which I saw him speak to our waiter. Our waiter looked at us and then, presumably, went off to find a chair. I stood there, waiting, for five minutes while I saw our waiter serve drinks and food to other tables, patiently waiting for my chair. I finally had to flag him down and ask for a chair, again, before I got one. This kind of set the tone for the evening, but I didn't know it at the time.  Finally sitting, we ordered drinks. One of our guests ordered a framboise. That's pronounced \"fram-bwahs\" due to the final E. This is important in a second, so hold on. Our waiter replied \"that's framb-wah.\" My wife, looking embarrassed that our waiter had just corrected our guest, told him that no, it's pronounced fram-bwahs. I know this sounds like a silly thing, but   1. she's right, and 2. she's had people try to mansplain at her that she's wrong before, which is exactly what this dude was doing.  3. furthermore, in what universe does a waiter correct a guest's pronunciation, even if they are wrong (which she wasn't)?  Our waiter gave her kind of a funny look when she said that. Okay, maybe he's just tired or just had a rude table or something. Not going to let it bother me.  Hold on, because this is where it gets weird.  That's when he started blowing us off. We had to ask for silverware twice after our food showed up and sat there, cooling, with us unable to eat it. He passed our table six times (six times! yes, I counted!) without even offering to refill our drinks until I finally had to flag him down. When he did bring refills, he brought them for everyone except my wife.  Explain that. I'll wait.  Look, bottom line, I'm still going to go to Yardhouse. In fact, we went back a couple of days after, if only to wash the bad taste out of our mouths. I'm not going to let this one dude ruin it for me. But if I get sat in his section again, I'm going to ask to be moved.",

    "text": "Until last night's visit to the Yardhouse I was a big fan....now, I'm not so sure, here's why.  A good friend and his fiance were visiting from California and wanted to get together for dinner & drinks.  Since Town Square is located on the Strip, it was a convenient place for us to meet.  Over the past few weeks I've been drinking a lot of IPA's and Chimay and was telling him that the Yardhouse would be a great place for him to give them a try.  Since they don't have a Yardhouse where he lives in California, we were all very excited.  The Better Half and I met them at the Yardhouse.  It was pretty packed for a Sunday evening but we were able to find 4 spots at the bar in the corner so we could face each other and get seated immediately.  After browsing the beer menu, we decided on a Stone IPA.....the bartender said they no longer had it.  Ok, how about the Long Hammer IPA?  Nope...no longer carry it.  He proceeded to tell me they only had 1 or 2 of the IPA's on the menu because they are in the process of switching out the menu......what?  WTF is that?  I understand changing out the menu, but not being able to offer what you have listed until you make the change.....that's BS!  Especially for a place that claims to have 100's of beers on tap!  Ok.....well, if that's the case we asked for a Chimay Triple....guess what?  They didn't have any!  At this point I was a little embarrassed because I hyped up this place as a solid \"go to\" place to enjoy new brews and good food.  We settled for a Ranger IPA and called it a day.  For food we ordered Hot Wings, 4 Cheese Pizza, Jambalaya, and Sliders.  The Pizza was very soggy, even though I ordered it well done....that's the second time we've had Pizza and it come out soggy....we won't order it again.  The rest of the food was good, but not great.  Overall, it was a disappointing night at the Yardhouse.  There are tons of places in Vegas that serve good bar food, but came here specifically for beers that were not available....and that's suppose to set them apart from the rest.  I hope this was an anomaly and not the beginning of a trend.",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times before, but once I turned 21 this has been one of my go-to spots for happy hour because the specials are amazing! The fact that they have mini take home happy hour menus makes it all the more tempting as well.   Allow me break it down for you: Happy hour is Mon-Fri 3pm-6pm, Sun-Wed 10pm-close  Domestic Pints - $3.50, Craft&Import Pints - $4.25-$4.75 Sliders served on a bed of fries  ($6.75): Classic, Bearnaise, Pastrami, Turkey, Veggie. Ahi is $9.95  Half priced pizzas: BBQ chicken, 4cheese, Ham & pineapple, Margherita, Pepperoni & Mushroom, Spicy Thai Chicken  Half priced apps: Crab cakes, Calamari, Cali Roll, Chinese Garlic Noodles, Chicken Nachos, Onion Ring Tower, Wings, Boneless wings, Veggie wings, Hawaiian Poke stack, Spicy tuna roll, Seared Ahi Sashimi, Chicken lettuce wraps, Fried chicken strips, spinach cheese dip, Moo Shu egg rolls  Doesn't that just BLOW your mind? It's like a plethora of cheap happy hour eats and you'll probably get full off of one order of sliders, or 2 of their apps.   So far I've tried: -Bearnaise sliders (Bearnaise sauce and fried shoestring onions on the patty w/ a side of very skinny fries that are tenderly cooked with a very light batter coating which gives them a perfectly crunchy exterior and \"juicy\" inside) -BBQ chicken and Margherita pizzas (They pretty much taste as they should. Sometimes the BBQ chicken is a little too saucy for my taste though) -calamari (Yum. Perfectly fried on the outside and melting on the inside. Served w/ marinara and, I wanna say tartar sauce? I usually go with the red..) -Traditional wings (First and last time I had these, they were so spicy! My bf couldn't even handle them and he claims to love hot stuff, hehe. The thing that I don't like about these wings is that you can't choose how spicy you want them, so you have to be prepared for whatever they give you)  Everything I've tried has been pretty good so far and there is still so much more I have yet to try! I know my boyfriend has been having some sort of frenzy over the happy hour poke stack. He's gone to this location about 4 times in the past month, by himself, just to sit and eat the poke stack, so I can only guess how delicious it must be.   Key points: -Happy hour is awesome here -Traditional wings are hot! (at least for me) -Calamari is delectable -French fries are close to perfect -Great for groups -Service has been pretty fast on the days that I've gone",

My only beef is with the layout of the Town Square.  It is incredibly hard to find places in this area unless you already know where they are.  We drove past the Yard House twice because the main entrance is not on one of the streets.  And when it is 105 degrees out, you really don't want to wander around on foot.",

The happy hour menu consists of various appetizers at half price. I highly recommend the chicken nachos and the pastrami sliders.   As far as ambiance goes, it definitely has a feel good atmosphere and it's a great place to relax and catch a game/sporting event on one of the many TV's around the joint.   The lowdown- Bring your friends, bring a date, eat some good food, enjoy yourself.",

Good to see folks out and about enjoying good food, a large selection of beers, and of course.. sports on the countless TVs that were spread out around the restaurant. It was a bit dark in there for my taste, hard to read the menu. The fact that there was plenty of seats, was great. You had a choice of tables, booths, or the bar. I liked that the menu had a wide selection of items to chose from: soups, salads, seafood, burgers, sandwiches, and comfort foods like mac and cheese. Service was speedy and efficient. We didn't get to the desert menu because we were full. Maybe next time I am at Town Square I'll stop in and enjoy the food, beer, and great atmosphere.",

We came here for the Happy Hour. The amazing thing is that the \"appetizers\" here are nothing short of greatness. We got the classic sliders (protein style), ahi poke, spicy tuna style (2), calamari, chicken lettuce wrap, and ahi sashimi.  The sliders are similar to any other bar food. The ahi tuna, spicy tuna roll style was amazing. Presented beautifully as well. I think the portion of the calamari was huge for $6. The chicken lettuce wrap alone will hit all of your taste buds! Also, the sashimi here is amazing! I can't wait to arrive again!  Our server was Bryan, and he got a great tip to accommodate his service!",

    "text": "I've been to Yard House quite a few times. I often frequent this place with friends or bring out of town guests here because the menu is extensive and there is something on it for just about everyone. Plus the beer selection, as well as the wine, and mixed drinks have the ability to please every palate.   Recently I brought my sister and brother-in-law here based off of those facts. Three people with probably rather different tastes is kind of a hard combo to deal with when choosing a dining spot. Luckily, Yard House did the trick.   There was a wait when we arrived, but it was only about 10 minutes and we were seated in a large, comfy booth, although next to the kitchen and a bit noisy, it was okay as we could all still carry on a conversation without yelling to be heard.   The run down of the food went as following -  Grilled Artichoke Appetizer - delicious! The artichoke was grilled perfectly and served with a garlic dipping sauce. We ate every bite and then tried to eat more. Baked potato chips were also served with it, the perfect appetizer.  Seared Ahi Steak Sandwich - Okay, this was just about the best thing I've had to eat in a LONG time. The ahi was seared perfectly, somewhat cooked around the outside, and deliciously raw on the inside. The pairings in the sandwich were perfect- spinach, Swiss cheese, tomato, and caramelized onions. It comes on a rye bread and with shoe-string french fries. Honestly, this sandwich is worth every penny.   Cuban Roast Pork Dip - My sister ordered this sandwich and it looked very good. It came with a BBQ au jus and shoe-string french fries.   House Salad & Clam Chowder - My brother-in-law opted for this. The soup came out piping hot and he said it was really good. My sister declared it to be good too. The house salad was BIG, much bigger than I was expecting, so kudos to YH on the portions.   Overall I have to give it up to Yard House. This most recent visit was definitely a 5 star affair. Everything was cooked well, service was good, the wait wasn't long, the noise level was decent, and  we were in and out with zero problems.",

This place has a large selection of food and beers to choose from. We've been here several times in the past, but I have to say that last night really impressed us. We came in for dinner and were seated promptly once we walked through the door. Our waiter came by to introduce himself and immediately took our food and drink order. Since we had two growing teenage boys with us, we ordered the onion ring tower and poke nachos as appetizers. I ordered the sesame chicken with noodles, my boyfriend ordered the ahi tuna sandwich with fries, and the boys ordered the Bbq bacon and cheddar burger with fries. Although the food took a bit longer to come out than anticipated, our waiter was proactive in checking on us and constantly refilling our drinks. I really like that because it shows how attentive he was to ensuring that we were ok and never letting our cups get empty. When the food finally came out, we found everything to be delicious. In addition, the portions were extremely huge and filling. I had to get a to-go box for mine.   Overall, this place is amazing! The food is fantastic and the service is on point. We will be back for sure. I definitely recommend this place.",

It's really exceptional or lacking.  As for the beers and drinks, this business offers a crazy part of the reasons I became primarily plant-based is because sometimes I have gotten sick eating the meat here at times.  For the regular menu with the popular dishes.  I could really care less for this place.  The appetizers shine sure, but only on happy hour, even then sometimes those dishes seem pricey.  Beer and tapas/apps are the way to go here.  I prefer the atmosphere here more than I really even enjoy the food.  Service is 50/50  There were times I've had moody ass female servers trying to act more masculine and just have an attitude.  Other times you get service from really heartfelt and genuinely nice folks with professional and courteous encounters.  Every time you get the few that still take their job seriously by being funny and prompt, expressing apologetic and \"I'll fix it right away\" natures.  Yet, each visit, the frequency of great services wanes.  I honestly have to say that with hosts and servers, within the past 6months with let's say, 18 visits.  I only enjoyed the food, the moment, the service, the price only 4 times.  If it weren't for my friends' wanting to come here for a happy hour before going to Blue Martini or the movies.  I probably wouldn't even come here on my own time.  Way back when this place woulda been a 5/5 for me, 2 years ago was a 4/5.  Now it's just a decent place to go to sometimes.  Like the modern Applebee's or Chile's before they went to shit.  Being a compliment and a critical opinion opting improvement using the same word.  Certain the majority will still like it, but the few that have visited often or always looking for improvement in their visits here, along with quality of the dishes and service will notice flaws that have been long overlooked by management.",

We were less than impressed by the nachos we had, but the manager personally came over and made sure that we enjoyed the rest of our experience. To be honest, Yard House had such an AMAZING playlist going. I'm in my early 20s, but they were playing the best songs from the 80s, 90, 2000s.

Asked for water and you would have thought I asked bartender to spit out a kidney. Bar was half empty and still a game of ducking & diving to make eye contact. Thought it was funny that their local six pack sampler is four beers. Their chalkboard series used to be great and now it's sheep micro in wolf macro clothing. Nothing that special. The limited drafts are their contract brewed brews. One of the descriptions for seasonal drafts on electronic board \"rotating selection of craft beer ...\" Too lazy or indifferent to bother updating name or description. Time for less lazy management I guess.",

They have TONS of options on tap, but I didn't order anything. The fried calamari was fried perfectly which came with two types of dipping sauces: tartar and some red sauce (sorry I'm not sure what it was called). They also include slices of batter fried ginger so beware!! The fish & chips tasted great--had a nice kick to them--only complaint would be the batter is a bit thick so some parts can be doughy. They come with thin cut fries and two sauces as well.   I would've given the place 4 stars, but the service is what makes it 5/5. There wasn't a single time my glass was empty. Despite how busy it was, the service was genuine. Justin, you rocked it!! Definitely will be back for Happy Hour $$.",

    "text": "Awesome happy hour at Yard House! It's Mon-Fri, 3-6pm and Sun-Wed 10pm-till closing. Pretty good options for food and discounted drinks. Wonderful thing about it, happy hour does not only cover the bar area, it's though the whole restaurant. I love that! During our visit we had: Four cheese pizza; buffalo wings; spicy tuna roll; calamari.  The pizza was really good, like REALLY good! Fresh, super cheesy with thin crust. We really enjoyed it.  The wings were all Mr's. I usually worry when he orders wings because he's pretty choosy. Well the wing nazi was left satisfied.  The calamari was delicious, it came with two sauces and was in both circular shape and testicles.  The least enjoyed pick for me was the spicy tuna roll. It's a big layered roll that has no rice and soy beans on the bottom. I did not care for it much because I felt like the tuna was not fresh. It seemed like the roll has been pre-made and left in the fridge for when ever needed to be served.  The cocktails were great! I had a Hawaiian mule that had a delicious pineapple flavor and a black orchid martini. The service was really good even though the restaurant was super busy. Our server was fast and attentive.  Our bill was super reasonable too. We had 4 drinks in total (the Hun's had Henny and coke) and 4 apps for about $60. Another bonus? They do not skim on the portions for happy hour! We really enjoyed our meal and will certainly return.",

You're serving a lot of visitors and you should want them to have a good experience with the food.  Having said all that, your servers and staff are incredible. Our server Chris was phenomenal and everyone there is very nice and professional. I  don't even blame the chef/ cooks. They can only work with what they are given.

I had two tacos (chicken and asada) that came with some rice and beans. I asked for a substitute of beans to be without cheese but that never came (wasn't my server whom I asked; no complaints about her as I thought she did a good job). I can't say anything bad about the tacos except they are basically twice as expensive as they should be--wjrh tip around $18 for two smallish tacos and a side of rice. I can get much better tacos for much less money at Bomb Tacos, Tacos El Gordo, and various other spots.  So, I can't quite give it a positive review.",

    "text": "Yard house has always been the spot for my friends and I. We would always go here for their happy hour after our hard exams in college, and we still go occasionally to watch a few sports games  and catch up once and awhile.  Staff/Decor:  This place has it all, from nice lighting and atmosphere to outdoor seating for when Vegas gets one of those few beautiful days. The staff is generally fast and always ready to help with selection or if you have an opinion. The bar area is nice and full of seating. The only downside I could see is sometimes there is a wait, but even then the wait times are not bad (obviously days with sports games going on are busy).  Food/drink: The food and drinks here are pretty good! This place has been a staple since my early college years. We often would get a bunch of food from the happy hour menu (appetizers usually) and share the food because it was half off. This includes pizza, nachos, sliders, and more!! All of which I can honestly say taste amazing. The other times I didn't order from happy hour is the bacon Mac n cheese is awesome, the burgers are good. The drinks range from beer, wine, to your classic cocktails and more which is a extensive drink menu.  Overall it's a great place to catch up with your friends, grab a few drinks, share a few appetizers, maybe kick back watch a game or two and all for a great price, did I mention their happy hour is amazing ;).",

I came here after getting in from a late flight. I was starving and needed something hearty but healthy. This showed up on Yelp and sounded good at the time. It's right along the bus route so I made a stop. The thing is that I didn't know how far back this is. Pretty far from Las Vegas Boulevard. This is in the middle of the Town Square shopping center, which is massive. After finally figuring out where it was and arriving, I sat at the bar. The menu has lots of vegetarian choices. I was pleased they had a Beyond Burger. I was not pleased that it was $16 and there were no good menu options that cost less. This was about the only thing that wasn't fried or had meat so I went with it, and was pleased it was as big as it was.   I could come here again. I'll check for any specials before going the next time. The food is good, it's just not something to get each week.",

Happy hour is where it's at if you plan a future visit to YH! Monday - Friday happiest hour runs from 3-6pm then they have a secondary sesh later in the night for all you night owls! The happy hour menu is actually legit! Everything if not most, is 50% off - with all the usual suspects: sliders, calamari, poke nachos, chicken lettuce wraps ... all being just a few of my favorite happy hour items! The portions are huge, easily can be shared between 3-4 people! My favorite, favorite are the sliders!   I would definitely recommend YH for a chill birthday spot, GNO or kick back date night + movie!",

We ate here pretty late in the night at maybe 9pm and finished a little past 10pm. We could tell he was tired since it's been a long day, but we know he still tried his best to be nice and show some personality. We really appreciated it!   SERVICE 10/10 Bailey was great and super nice. He even split the appetizer my party shared evenly in our bills!  ATMOSPHERE 5/10 It is very dark inside and hard to see anything well really. I had to have someone else give me some lighting to get good food photos for yelp!  FOOD 7.5/10 The food here is good! I always find myself in yardhouse when I'm in town square.   -RECOMMENDATIONS-  -LOBSTER, CRAB, AND ARTICHOKE DIP- get this!!!! It comes with pita bread, regular chips, and purple chips. THE DIP IS SO FLAVORFUL. You can absolutely taste the lobster in it with the cheese and you can taste the artichoke without it being too overpowering. My cousins and I devoured this whole appetizer.  -LOBSTER & SHRIMP AGNOLOTTI- This one is quite pricey, it's over $20 but it's understandable since it's lobster pasta. The portion isn't too big, and I don't think I would be full from this on a regular day without getting an appetizer with it. However, the taste is very delicious! Even though it's expensive I always find myself gravitating towards this item whenever I come here. The sauce is creamy, a little sweet, and savory. It comes with 3 shrimp on top and a little bit of lobster meat. If you're feeling fancy, totally try this!  -VAMPIRE TACOS- My cousin ordered this, and she really liked it! I had a bite and I'm for sure going to try this on my own next time. It's a crispy cheese taco shell that's really the star of the show and makes it more unique than other tacos! The flavors of the tacos mingle well. I'd get this if you're not feeling too hungry because you can choose how many tacos you want to order!!  Overall I had a pretty good experience at yardhouse! It's not a restaurant I would go out of my way for, but I always stop by every time I'm in the area and feeling a little fancy.",

This place is perfect for date night because you can eat here and then cross over to the movies! The best part about yardhouse is you can customize ANYTHING and make it Vegan/Vegetarian.  For vegans I really recommend the gardein strips instead of wings. Ask for buffalo sauce because with the strips you get french fries. Menu hack!!! I also recommend the gardein chicken and rice bowl. Get it with brown rice.  For vegetarians I recommend getting the regular chicken nachos and subbing out gardein chicken. You can sub basically anything out for gardein. I love it so much.  Also they have so many beers on tap. I tried blue moon Mango and it was amazing!!! Probably one of my new favorite beers.  They also carry Shiner bock which is very rare in Vegas.  Shane was our server and he was wonderful. Give him a raise because he works very hard and you can tell he loves his job.  I forgot who the hosts were but the guy and the girl were very nice as well.  We had quick service and were in and out just in time to even put our leftovers in the car and walk back to the movies.  Mall employees: there are no mall employee discounts unfortunately. Maybe they should do even a 10% off as that would make it more appealing.",

We still can't believe we missed out on this place from not coming any sooner but better late than never!! (:",

I've been to this Yard House a few times for HH/drinks so my experience is limited to the bar area only and I cannot speak to a full service meal, however, the bar generally performs as expected: clean, quick, and friendly.   On my most recent visit, immediately as I sat down to the bar, there was a server/runner handling an order and he was very upset and swearing (in general and at his teammates) about a table mixup. Definitely not a welcoming way to arrive and what's holding the review back from a solid 4 stars.   On this visit, I also discovered their Gardein buffalo wings and they were pretty tasty! If I didn't know it wasn't real chicken, I think it would have taken me a few bites to really tell. Great faux product! We also had the chips and guac and the angry grapefruit rose drink which was very refreshing; kinda like a punch but not to sweet.   All in all, I'll keep enjoying their bar when I'm in the area, but I'm not hopeful for more than perfunctory service or encouraged to experience a full meal in their dining room.",

It's a huge plate stacked with chips, chicken, beans, cheese, tomatoes, onions, cilantro, red/green sauce, sour cream and guacamole. And when I say stacked, I mean STACKED. It tastes so bomb.

    "text": "I love the Yard House!!! I have been coming to this location and the one at Red Rock for several years now. I had a colleague come into town from Washington D.C and he wanted to go out for a early brunch. I had recommended the Yard House in Town Square.  Yard House is located in Town Square off of Las Vegas Blvd. You can get here from taking the 215/Las Vegas Blvd, or go straight down the Las Vegas Blvd from Mandalay Bay. It's located directly across from the movie theater.  Inside the restaurant, there is bar seating in the middle, surrounded by table booths. You can also sit outside, which allows you seating in a open area, visible to other restaurants and the town square movie theater.   My colleague and I ordered the following  Vegan Burger Vegan Chicken Fingers Mac N Cheese (2) no mushrooms.  Our waiter was phenomenal. He brought us waters and kept our soda filled all of the time.   It was my first time having Vegan Chicken Fingers and the flavor was amazing. I don't know how the Yard House did it, but the Vegan chicken fingers tasted like normal chicken fingers. The french fries were fried and salted to the right touch.  I had the Mac N Cheese (2) lunch portion. It was cheesy and the chicken tasted great. I would order it again. Plenty of left-overs for another meal.  This restaurant is great. If you haven't been to the Yard House, it's a great spot for lunch and dinner, so, check it out!",

The shrimp had a nice grilled taste and they were decent in size. The spinach mash potatoes kind of through me off until I took a bite and they're now one of my faves.   The broccolini is very good. It had a nice crunch to it and again seasoned well.   $34.95 isn't too shabby considering the quality of the food.   Unfortunately, I can do without the Cobb salad with the browning of the avocado. It looked welted and just not fresh as you can see in the picture.",

This restaurant was tucked away in a corner in the mall. It's a big restaurant inside, and good for big groups and bar seating. They have happy hour, too, which I would take advantage of!  Our server Blake was on top of his game and was very attentive. We all got our food in an ok time. It was crowded though on a Sunday late lunch! Expected that!There were many servers working hard to get to everyone though so no short of servers at this location!  The food was not a disappointment either! I had to get their famous Spicy Tuna Roll! I loved the flavor as it was just the right amount of savory to me! I also liked that there was no rice! I also got a side of their Shittake Garlic Noodles! Yumm!! Just thinking about it, I want to get some again! My hubby got the Lobster Garlic noodles but us also had shrimp in it! Still! It was so good with big chunks of lobster claw meat in it! This is a must have! The rest of our party so enjoyed their food as hunger was taken over for me to even take pics or try their food! Hahaha ...  Unfortunately, we didn't get any drinks as the night before, we had way to much to drink but I'm sure this place has awesome drinks!! Prices are decent but not real cheap either but quality of food was great as their service. We will definitely be back at this location if in the area! [28/100]",

I'm sure for like many, I was there for a movie and went to go grab a beer prior to the show.  We sat at the bar and ordered Ephemer, they didn't have it. (the only reason why I went there in the first place) got the Sam Adams summer ale instead.  Ordered wings but took like 20 mins for the staff to realize the printer was broken in the kitchen. 10 mins later, by the time we actually got the wings the movie was starting in 5min, so we decided to catch the next showing.    For those of you that like only the drum stick and not the wing of the chicken, this would be perfect.  They only serve the drum sticks that are breaded.  I would assume because they had to get it out of the kitchen so fast the chicken was not done all the way.  Still had a bit of pink by the bones.  We did not finish it.    They did take the wings off the check but the service was not as attentive as I would expect in a place where they have such an exotic selection of beers.  For someone that does not know about beers would feel intimidated and inclined to just order a bud light cause of the lack of help.    Overall it was not the best first impression, but they have a great product and I will visit again for the beers.",

    "text": "Boy is Yard House pricey. Good thing for the invention of happy hour. They hold theirs Monday through Friday from 4pm-6pm. My group got there at 4:45 and racked up most of the damage before HH ended, but the last few items boosted the check up by a third.   The well drinks run for four dollars and change, while the beers cost around four to six dollars. All the appetizers are half off and a great deal. If you are like me, a few of them makes for a better meal than any entree.   We got the chicken nachos, fried chicken strips, seared ahi, classic sliders, hummus, a pepperoni and mushroom pizza, and chicken wings. If you come during the designated time, then all of these except the hummus are half off. It is a great deal, but I would reconsider if it was at full price. They are generous with their portions. Both the sliders and chicken strips come in an order of four with fries. This was perfect because it matched the number of people at our table. Both dishes would be worth it at the regular price. The ahi tuna was cooked nicely, but the sauce was too salty. It definitely did not need soy sauce, but I used up all the wasabi. The chicken nachos were nothing special. It is a generous portion, but the salsa looked more like marinara, the chicken was on the dry side, and the guacamole lacked the tang and spice. They were also bountiful with the wings. Asking for them to be cooked extra crispy and having the sauce on the side guarantees for perfect wings. The hummus was packed with sodium and tasted a little bitter. The pizza came out quick, bubbling, and beautiful. Too bad, I was too full by that time, but my friend liked it.    If you ever wanted to try a new beer, but afraid you might not like it, come for happy hour. At worst, you are out a few dollars. At best, you might meet your new best friend.   Another thing worth mentioning, the staff were on their game tonight. It was not that busy, but our server was awesome. Crystal was funny, sassy, and full of energy.   The only reason why I gave them three stars is because I worry about the amount of salt they use in all of their dishes. I know people complain about MSG at Chinese restaurant, but I drank five glasses of water while dining and am still guzzling it now. It was tasty, but my taste buds are on over drive and going nuts.",

    "text": "Wow!  Now that's what I call a Beer Selection.  If you are in Vegas and want to sample some beers, this is a great place to check out.  Unfortunately for me, I came here a day after my birthday and I was still in major recovery mode so I did not really get to take advantage of their abundant beer list.    Their food was just okay for me but then again, maybe me being in recovery mode affected my taste buds too so maybe I'd give them another shot.  Definitely will be back at least to get some beers as I love fresh beer.  Bottled beer does not do the name \"Beer\" justice.    And the service was excellent all around.  Since we had to wait for a table, we actually hung out at the bar for about 20 to 30 mins.  And since they had so many beers, we needed to ask the bartender for advice.  He was extremely patient with us.  And once we sat down at our table, again, the server, was excellent.  She kept coming around every few minutes to check on us and make sure everything was okay.    3 Words: BEER! BEER! BEER!",

I had the best steak sandwich I've ever had in my life!  It was a little more cooked than I had asked for ( I ordered med-rare and I got medium toward the well side), but nevertheless delicious!  And the steak was so succulent and tender I really can't complain. My hubby had the seared ahi sandwich, which was mouth watering delicious.   The service was good even if the waitress was a little bit too fake, but everyone in Vegas is working on tips so I can't blame her. She did let my beer go empty one time though!  Shame on her.  Unlike the location in Long Beach this one seems to be very family oriented, there were tons of people here eating with their children.  Hardly anyone at the bar, go figure.  We'll definately come back next time we're in town.",

That being said, Yard House offers an entire section offering Gardein, a delicious meat alternative suitable for vegans and vegetarians.  HOWEVER, beware because they cook it on the same grill as the rest of the meat.  They were nice enough to cook my meat substitute in a separate pan so that my meal was still vegan, and it was pretty decent.  It was great when we were in a bind for time, as they got us in and out of there as quickly as possible and the waiter was very nice and attentive.  It is really loud and busy there, not exactly my cup of tea.  However, they were able to accommodate me despite the business and I am super happy about that.  I would definitely come back to this location, as many other Yardhouses are not willing to cook the vegan meat separately.",

    "text": "This is a great place to take a ditzy first date because they play the music so loud it's impossible to have any kind of a decent conversation. The reason I come to a restaurant is to eat and maybe have a chat with the person I'm sitting next to. If I want loud, blaring music I'll go to a club. Don't try to do both. Minus one.  Now, on to the food, which is actually quite good.  Seared Ahi Sashimi - It was fresh, but too much black pepper around the edges for me. I also didn't care for the heavy vinaigrette it was sitting in. Fried Calamari - Pretty good although I'd like more rings and fewer squid tentacles, thanks. Classic Sliders - Very traditional sliders, not bad. Fries are awesome. Grilled Korean BBQ Beef - Tasted very authentic, just as good as any Korean restaurant. Spinach Cheese Dip - Not the best I've ever had, but then again how can you mess up spinach dip? Linguini & Clams - I loved this dish. Clams were fresh and the sauce was tasty. Draft Beer - A+  The service was just ok. Our waitress did the bare minimum necessary to keep us happy. I agree the best time to come here is during happy hour. Any other time it's just way overpriced. I mean, $10 for eggrolls, really? Minus two.  Will I be back? Yes, but probably only during happy hour and I would recommend you give it a try if you haven't been here before.",

    "text": "Okay, there are a few things that are going to be brought up and I'm almost guaranteed to get a manager comment on this, but whatever, it's happening.  Went here last night to try the Gardein line here. I was very excited to see that vegan meats have been added to some of their dishes. How cool is that?? But upon doing some internet research before we ordered, I found out that due to cooking methods, ALL of the dishes wouldn't be vegan OR vegetarian. They cook everything on the same grill as the meat. What sense does this make? None. It's like having a black coat and putting bleach all over it - it doesn't resemble a black coat anymore and is tainted. If you mix vegan food with meat, what is the point?   And here comes why it is 2-star. IT IS NOT STANDARD PROCEDURE FOR THE VEG*N MENU TO BE COOKED IN A SEPARATE PAN. You have to go out of your way to ask for this, and even then a manager comes out to explain that it's not going to taste the same as if it were on the grill. Hmm - do you really think a vegan WANTS dead cow mixed in with her food? HELL NO. Granted, Yardhouse has already taken *some* action and put a little dot next to a few items that absolutely will come in contact with meat since these items are fried and have to go in the same basket as everything else. But they haven't specified that ALL the menu items will come in contact with animal products which is not okay. It would be really helpful if people who come here know this right off the bat. If I hadn't had my phone on me that night, I literally would have gotten sick since I haven't had any sort of meat in 6 years.   Here's what I would suggest: just like other companies before you (Chipotle comes to mind), please automatically make all the vegetarian/Gardein items cooked separately from the meat. You don't want a lawsuit a la McDonald's. It is ridiculous that these vegan meats come to you and then you cross-contaminate them with animal sources to make them not even vegetarian. Oh and this isn't just for this Yardhouse, it goes for all of them - trust me, I will be contacting your corporate offices today. Also, it would be nice if you could put a little V next to the items that could be made vegan or are vegan on the menu. Makes ordering easier, and the confusion of your staff minimal.  Anyways, I ordered the veggie sliders that come with fries, and we also ordered a side of sweet potato fries. Matt ordered a thai \"chicken\" pizza. After some back and forth, the sliders couldn't even go on the bread (only the wheat bread is vegan) so I got them protein style, wrapped in lettuce. The sweet potato fries we got as our appetizer were severely lackluster. Very bland, no taste, no toppings like sugar or anything. We couldn't have the sauce since it contained bacon, so I guess that's where all the flavor is. After the aforementioned back and forth with the wait staff, we got our food. Do they seriously only have the meat and the bun (in my case, lettuce) for the sliders? NOTHING else? No tomato or onion or even ketchup and mustard? For serious? The taste of the Gardein patty was wonderful, but for almost $11 for plain patties is ridiculous. The fries were way better than the sweet potato ones, but it just wasn't worth the price. I wish they would have suggested to make my order a veggie burger since that's essentially what they did anyways, was cut the patty into four pieces and pass them off as sliders. At least then I could have had the wheat bun and toppings.   It was very difficult throughout the night to try and signal our waitress. I know it was very busy and that I did ask a lot of questions and such, but she was an expert ninja. Not the best customer service in the world. I also unfortunately don't see this Gardein line lasting here at Yardhouse. Until cooking the items separately becomes standard procedure, I can see a lot of vexed veg*ns. Honestly, what is the point of having vegan meats if they're going to end up on the same grill as actual meats? I just don't get that logic. Yardhouse itself is a bit pricey and I understand this, but at least give the customer the most you can. Plain sliders are not okay. In fact, I don't think I've been anywhere that has completely bare sliders.   Due to the lackluster food, the outrageous price tag and the lack of good customer service, Yardhouse really deserves a 1-star review but I still love that a chain has decided to put vegan faux meats on their menu. The intent is there, but the execution is awful but can be easily improved upon. I might be back since there were other items that looked appetizing, but only when I want to deal with the headaches and the hassle. Until then, I'll stock up on Gardein at Whole Foods and make my own delights at home.",

As for service, I have to give them at lest 4 stars.  The team here always makes sure that your fully hydrated with whatever you're drinking.  As for the food here, I've eaten at plenty Yard House's in Las Vegas and California.  When it comes to this specific Yard House, it's mainly just appetizers and during happy hour.  The calamari, seared ahi, and sliders are mu favorites here. I think prices are inexpensive, especially during HH, and because the service is pretty good, I have to state that I do recommend.",

The hostesses both acted as if they didn't want our business but we stuck it out because we were at Town Square and wanted a sit down meal (plus the food is really good here). The waiter, I think his name was Celal, was so sweet and helpful. His recommendations were spot-on and our food came quickly despite the full restaurant. He looked to be juggling about a quarter of the tables himself, and was always checking on us. The food was amazing. The covered patio heaters worked well so we weren't freezing our bums off and the tables and silverware were spotlessly clean.",

We received our food and additional drinks seamlessly. We arrived around 5 p.m. and were promptly seated on the patio with the heater over head. Tasha was great about turning it on and off if we got too hot.   We ordered the Pepper Jack burger with roasted pablanos and a fantastically tasty garlic aioli. The fries were awesome. I am not a fry person and will typically leave them for last. I am so glad I ate them first because they were some of the best fries I've ever had a perfectly seasoned shoe string fry. I love super thin cut crispy fries.  Ironically the first few beers I mentioned Tasha were not on the menu such as Franziskaner Hefe-Weissbier. Tasha was able to point out a couple of other suggestions but I ended up with my other favorite, Tripel Karmeliet. After living years in Milwaukee I have tried a lot of beers. Yardhouse is great for finding things I haven't had in awhile.   They make a mean turkey club with fresh ingredients the only low note of the dinner or should I say blah moment was the seared ahi tuna that we had for an appetizer. It wasn't bad nor was it great. It was pretty middle of the road and a forgettable part of the evening amongst the great beer and sandwiches we enjoyed.   We will definitely be back several times for the patio atmosphere, great fries and wide selection of beers and drinks.",

    "text": "Yep, I'm done.   First, the dude that hosts late night (Vince?) seems completely and totally miserable. He's been like that several times now, even when my outgoing husband has tried to engage him in a convo, it's just not happening. That dude either hates life, people, his job, or all three. Not a fun way to start the night.  So we ended up there Thursday night just because I wanted the Dunkelweizen. Waitress says they don't have it, they're phasing it out, says she'll bring me a tester of a similiar one. Ok.   Comes back with another dude who says they're not phasing it out, he thinks they're just out but maybe they have an untapped keg in back. He'll go check. Next thing I know a different guy drops off a pint of some other beer. I take a few sips and it's fine, but not the dunkel and I am confused why it was given to me.   I figure I'll ask the waitress and in the meantime our apps are dropped off by yet another guy. Truffle fries tasted fine, but were cold. Hummus was weird. Couldn't figure out if it was old, over-seasoned, or had been dropped in a dirt pile and scooped back into the bowl. Kept finding weird super dark patches, so that's a no.  All this time while we're sort of eating,  I am taking sips of the beer because 1. I'm thirsty and have nothing else to drink and 2. Our waitress has pulled the famous Yard House dissappearing act. She finally shows up and I ask her why I have this beer \"Oh, that's the one I was telling you about that tastes like the dunkel\" I said, I thought you were bringing me a tester? Blank stare from her...I say, I wouldn't have ordered this one...She says \"well, I can take it away?\" I said I've already had half of it while waiting for you to come back...more awkward silence and finally she says I can charge you for a shorty? I say sure, fine and she leaves  Keep in mind we never ordered dinner, and when she was at the table our fries were gone, we are not eating the hummus and she proceeds to dissappear for TWENTY minutes. We sat there, not eating, I'm not drinking (husband was drinking soda which was getting replaced by a busser, I think) and we are desperately staring down every server in the place trying to telepathically beg for the check. That is when I added my not so favorable check in because I was pissed. We finally spot our waitress and practically yell out for the check and she seems genuinely surprised (REALLY?!?!) so I guess she was super clueless about us not having an enjoyable time.   Luckily we had cash, so we could bail without waiting another 20 minutes for a credit transaction, and have vowed to never ever ever go to Yard House again.",

Everything came out fast and was cooked to perfection. Jordan was very attentive and a plus was we were seated immediately despite how busy it was during lunch time.

Clam chowder, duck fat fries, jambalaya, Miso sea bass, orange chicken, Turkey pot pie, macadamia nut crusted Mahi Mahi, all of the street tacos, medium rare rib eye with broccolini, many of the Asian dishes with bok choy and jasmine rice - and plenty of desert options too!

What I do like about this place is their numerous beers on tap. Come here for happy hour and enjoy some good beers at decent prices.

My boyfriend and I decided to order two pilsner beers and we were comped for them, thanks to another waiter who brought out our appetizers.   Our waiter Mikey was nice but we noticed he was handling multiple tables and a group near us was waiting for their meals for a while.

On Wednesday February 1st my husband and I went to Yardhouse for a quick lunch. Our server was Kristyn. All was well with everything until the transaction went through on the credit card and it showed she added an extra dollar to her tip. My husband put a tip down of $3.45 our meal came to $21.00. He normally gives 20% but she never asked to see his ID on his credit card that on the back says \"check ID\" so his rule is thats a big deal to no check ID on a credit card that says check ID so he took a dollar off the tip. Well he sees on his bank statement that instead of $3.45 the charge is $4.45.  Not sure why a server would ADD money to a guests bill when thats not what was on there. The extra dollar isnt the issue the fact of the matter is thats unethical. That is wrong. Just dont want it happening to other people thats all.",

Pretty nicely done, actually, but would be nicer if they closed it off to care traffic. We likely wouldn't have found the place, though, were it not for our GPS leading us straight there on city streets.   Was busy for early evening but we got a table right away. The staff was extra attentive and got us everything we needed. My boyfriend and I were meeting friends and since we had a plane to catch, ordered before they got there. Getting meals at different times and two different bills was no problem for our waitress. What a relief!  Perusing the menu, I was surprised at the selection. Though the Yard House is a brew pub, they have a pretty interesting and appetizing menu that include gluten-free and vegetarian options. My boyfriend got a grilled ahi salad and I got the mac and cheese which is nothing like the usual mac and cheese. It had chicken, bacon, and wild mushrooms in it with a small pasta I'd never seen before. The sauce was made of several exotic cheeses and it was delicious! My friend's four-year daughter shared it with me so though I thought it gourmet and exotic, it was easy enough for her to enjoy as well. I tried the ahi and it was really tasty too. Our friends got burgers with cones of crispy french fries and everything looked delicious.   Overall, the restaurant is a loud and happening place but seems to be a good place to bring kids while still feeling like you're having a night out on the town. Prices were very reasonable and the service was fantastic. I would definitely come back.",

But the beer is always cold and good, the food is always yummy and fast!  Love their lettuce wraps and their poke bowl! Oh man I can go on and on about their food. Oh so yummy:)",

After looking over the menu we decided to stay seeing that everyone was able to find something they could settle with for the late lunch.  The menu selections seemed ok but something you can find almost anywhere. Typical burgers, sandwiches, salads, some steak and seafood options as well.    I decided on the Lamb burger with the feta cheese which gave the burger a different and savory flavor.  The meat was tender and seasoned well.  The fries were these little toothpick looking things that were not as satisfying as they looked.  I guess I prefer a steak style fry something with a little more carbs I guess.    The service was sufficient, a little slow at times but there was a football game on that allowed the time to pass.  However when you have a family the kids do not find equal enjoyment.  We might try this place again, but I am not sure if I would go out of my way to visit.  Maybe for the Happy hour they have tons of beer choices.  I don't care for the big crowds of rowdy people that do not know how to handle their booze.",

I love the bar, bartenders always walk by so you can always find one to get you your cocktail.  I also experiment when it comes to the drinks, there's so many to choose from.  If I'm bored I'll grab their beer samplers and afterwards choose and stick with one while I'm there.    Happy hour makes me happy here too!  But my last excursion here we had Lisa as our server, she was great.  And afterwards we chilled at the bar and Christian took care of us.  It's always a good time but Christian went above and beyond and was always on top of our drinks and service.",

I love coming here every time I am in Vegas. The ambience, the food, the beer, and the service is all great. From what I've experienced, everyone here knows what they're doing, and definitely has patience as you look through their extensive menus.   I am spoiled by the amount of beer and the prices from my home state (Wisconsin). Coming here feels like home, with the 160 or so beers on tap, and the decent prices - especially during happy hour.   The food comes out promptly, no matter how busy, and without any mistakes. It is always beautifully plated and tastes amazing. And! If I may add, adapts to allergies as necessary.   Eric is a fantastic bartender, by the way. Smiling and friendly, and knows how to talk to customers. Taylor is also great, paying attention and making sure your glass is full. Tim is awesome at suggesting beers. And Lauren is on top of it right when you come in, making sure you feel welcome.",

Located in the town square area there is plenty to do around the place.  Vegas is known for stranding places to eat in the middle of nothing if they are not attached to a casino.  Town Square s just the opposite.  Plenty of shopping and a movie theater in an open are plaza atmosphere.  Good for a first dat or to grab some brews with friends, go her if you can!",

    "text": "Our daughter, who lives in Vegas and comes here frequently, took us here for lunch on NFL Championship Game Sunday. It was crowded, but not packed, which was nice since we got a late start. The hostess said 20-30 mins and we were seated in 10. There are plasma TVs everywhere here, so I can't imagine there being a bad seat in the house to watch a game.   If I were designing the perfect sports bar (for me at least), this place would be the model. Start with the beer. The selection is impressive. You can take a beer tour of the world without leaving your seat. If you aren't sure where to start, do the 6 pack taster.   The food?  I think the hardest part about ordering is picking something. All of the appetizers looked delicious. We had the lobster, crab and artichoke dip. Excellent choice!  E, who is a salad connoisseur, had the walnut pear salad.  R had the sliders.  Both were excellent!  I had the BBQ bacon and cheese burger.  That burger is now on my \"top 5 burgers I've ever had\" list.  The meat was full of flavor and juicy and the rum BBQ sauce had a nice tang to it.  The atmosphere?  Nice and clean inside, with an upscale feeling to it.  The clientele was a good age mix, attractive and dressed like they actually cared about their appearance.  Last but definitely not least, the service.  Our server was great.  I think her name was Cyndi.  She was attentive without being intrusive and best of all, when it comes to us at least, she was patient.  The bottom line?  I wish they would seriously consider a location in Northern California.  Might I suggest the Streets of Brentwood Shopping Center?  This is definitely in our rotation of Vegas places to go when we're there.",

Indoor and outdoor seating.  The food is decent.  It's not all stellar but there are some pretty stellar creations.  Their CA roll is a bit unorthodox, but definitely worth a try.  Their ahi sandwich is pretty phenomenal.  As is their Sea Bass.  Their pizzas aren't half bad either.  There are happy hour times with some level of discount.  Favorite beers for me:  Boddingtons (a must try), Guinness, any stout, and yeah that's pretty much it.",

Next to us was a very drunk and rowdy, as well as  extremely inappropriately dressed crew. We were with our kids and tried to shield them from this group as best we could. We never thought to ask to move as it was very crowded. A few minutes later a waitress comes by to say she was moving us. I thought it was a mistake and said \"no. Wrong party\". A minute later our waitress comes up and explains that she is a mom and that we should not be sat next to this group. That we should be in a more family friendly section. She gets us all settled in with our new server. Everyone was so nice and they even threw in a free appetizer. We never asked for any of this. They went above and beyond to make us comfortable, even with a packed restaurant.  We've always loved this Yardhouse. Great place!",

The boy and I are familiar with the Yardhouse in Rancho Cucamonga so it was an easy decision as to what we would get for dinner. We arrived just in time for happy hour and got crab cakes and calamari. Our cousin who is not fond of anything seafood dug right in, which was a huge surprise. Calamari was alright. The tartar sauce wasn't as good as I remembered. It seemed a little bland.  The service for the drinks was a little slow. It took over 15 minutes for the house blonde. For dinner I chose my regular the mac and cheese and he had the grilled chicken and avocado sandwich. Immediately we noticed how dry my food was. It looked to have been sitting under the heat lamp for awhile. I ignored it and dug right in. I had to use salt and pepper to flavor it up (which I've never had to do) and it still tasted bland. We were extremely disappointed in the food but the service was pretty good overall.",

It's delicious art). They are must orders. We ate every bite. They service was pretty good at the bar, but that's because we went on a slow night. I will come back again and I need to have some of those beers. Then I can give it 5 stars, maybe :-)",

    "text": "Hmm I eat here often and a two is the average I have to give it. Sometimes it's a 4, and sometimes a 1. Let me tell you about when I gave it a 1.  We go there, wait an hour right in front of the booth with three attendants (who have had a clear view of us the entire time). After the one hour mark (they quoted 35 minutes) I politely walked up and ask what the deal was.   They then inform me that they activated the little beeper they gave us and no one answered it. (remember we are sitting 4 feet away from them the whole time)  They then proceeded to seat what looked like 10-12 parties ahead of us (from the crossed out names I saw on the waiting list) OK no big deal mistakes happen and it's hard to find good help.  We get to our table. Order some beers. The waitress can't figure out if she is able to use my friend's passport as a legal ID... I mean, my friend is obviously over 21; in fact she is nearly 40, but again no big deal, she leaves and comes back at best 7 minutes later with a manager approval.  We then order our beers and our food.  It takes 20 minutes just to get our drinks. This is just silly because I know they have only 4-5 table sections.    So the beer comes and I did check my watch, it took about 40 minutes to get our food.  The food my girlfriend and our mutual friend ordered came out looking and tasting good, but mine... a simple burger..  came out burnt when I ordered it medium rare. I made a small comment about it and initially refused to have it remade because of time restraints and not wanting to wait another 40 minutes. I then realized it had some ingredients that I asked not to be put in the food. The waitress assured me it would only take ten minutes at best so I conceded to have it remade. Well another 30 minutes goes by and my table mates are done eating and I'm sitting around waiting for a burger that finally arrives... BURNT again.  So wtf.  The manager comes to talk to us for the 2nd time and clearly must be high. It went something like this Manager walks up... and says;  \"oh Man I'm sorry, dang I hate it when that happens to me... ahh *sigh* wow that totally sucks\"  Then; proceeds to just stand there looking upset about my burger until we had to basically console her about it!!   \"ah no worries it's not that big of a deal\"    LOL oh man. So they did infact comp the burger. But hell for a 14 dollar burger you would think you could get it cooked right. I have had good experiences at yard house too btw. But DAMN WTF",

Of the huge selection of 1/2 priced pizzas and appy's, my partner and I tried the Pepperoni and Mushroom Pizza, Buffalo Wings, and the Fried Calamari over two wonderful HH's. My favorites being the Buffalo Wings and Well Drinks! For the price and value of HH at the Yard House, I have no complaints. This will be one of our regular stops in the Vegas area!",

Late Happy hour is after 11 pm til 2 am Sunday to Wednesday.  We recommend the BBQ chicken pizza, Blue Crab Cakes, Jamaican Jerk Wings, Chinese Chicken lettuce wrap, Turkey Slider Not burger, Fried Calamari, Try Most of the happy hour appitizer they are pretty damn good.  Outside of the happy hour menu, the food is pretty good and a little expensive for what it's worth to us.  Beer Seletction here is ridiculous!  Something like over 100 different one.  They have TV all around with sport channel usually showing so this is great for all those that watch sports.",

My boyfriend and I ordered 4 appetizers/small plates and it filled us up quite nicely! We went with the wings (Caribbean jerk - traditional), truffle fries, garlic noodles and poke bowl - all amazing and would definitely recommend!   Great for big groups! We had a party of 16...ordering and paying was a breeze! Our waiter kept the checks separate from the get-go and they were very attentive to make sure we got what we needed throughout our meal!",

It's never taken more than 15 minutes for my food to come out, and the waiters always stop by your table to check on you. I wouldn't bring kids here really considering it is a barstaraunt. My favorite place to go weekends or weekdays, always great prices. I recommend any of their sandwiches or burgers with truffle fries or sweet fries !!",

It is just one of many on their huge list.  The sweet potato fries are a must try! It comes with a delicious maple aioli. We also had the Ahi Crunchy salad with the star obviously being the tuna. The dressing wasn't my favorite but overall the salad was still a success. The peppercorn Gorgonzola is another favorite of mine!  Rebecca was our server last night and she was a sweetheart. She have great service, while still allowing her own personality to shine through. A great experience overall!",

I'm finding their pricing getting to be a  it ridiculous. So I was looking for the Thai Gardein chicken pizza and they took it off the menu... along with a few other items I enjoyed. So that sucks. Service was good enough... what is should be ya know. Since I couldn't get my pizza I went with the Margarita pizza instead. It was ok. I feel like it was over cheesed and their spin on it was different than what I'm used to. Using giant chunked tomatoes instead of slices which was ok, and full cloves of garlic which was Alonso ok. The Gardein chicken fingers are always great. And my favorite is the Gardein Orange chicken. Which is like 18-19$ depending on location I think. And that seems a bit much. All in all... there isn't a ton of satisfaction here these days. But they have some good eats and of course great beer and cocktail options.",

An almost overwhelming variety of appetizers, salads, sandwiches, and even chicken-substitute options among other choices were appealing to my group.  When we arrived at about 6.30 on a Sunday night, there was a very long line which made me wish I had called ahead. However, we were seated within 10 minutes. Our waiter clearly did not think that our 24-and-under table would tip well, a tendency that bothers me since I always tip generously for good service. He was rude and abrupt, especially when we declined to order alcohol. He even took my menu away before I was done ordering.  The food was brought out by a different server, and a pleasant smile and the shocking addition of a few kind words were a breath of fresh air from our server, who was anything but courteous.  The food itself was stellar. One companion had a grilled burger, which had excellent flavor; my sister had the vodka pasta, which was also delicious. My shrimp lettuce wraps were good, but tricky to put together and eat - I wouldn't order that on a first date or business meeting! Overall: great ambiance and location, terrible service, and awesome food!",

    "text": "My favorite bar and top 5 on my restaurant list so far, came here for my 21st! My brother had worked there and said everything on the menu is good. Now i come every excuse i get. Start it off with Truffle fries, with all the unique sauces you can get. Fresh, nice texture, they dont forget to clean the oil. Don't let anyone try your fries or you'll be swatting hands away all night  Sadly they no longer have maple bacon sauce which went good with everything. Ive tried burgers, salads, but mostly chicken. The southwestern chicken sandwich (or maybe its Cajun chicken sandwich?) Is to die for. I haven't tried anything i didn't like or love. If you haven't been here, come here with a friend. Its not the perfect dating atmosphere unless you don't mind having to speak loudly.   The beer gets it's own section.  I check out the brew menu every time.  The outside of the brewery is decorated with the barrels and hoses coming out, tons of barrels. First time you see it its a nice aesthetic. Tons of options.. So far \"Deschutes Fresh squeezed\" is nice for citrusy hop kick. If youre a hop head its a no brainer to get a double indian pale ale (DIPA.) I like \"squatters double IPA\" high on the ABV, and around a 70 on IBU's. Its about 8%. For first time craft beer consumers, ABV= Alcohol by Volume % IBU= International Bitterness Unit. Higher the IBU the more hops usually.  The bartenders and even waitress/waitors are usually knowledgeable about the beer/wine/spirits.  I took it more mild after 2 mugs of Deschutes and 1 of DIPA, so i ordered a \"not your father's root beer\" except for the last sips, tastes just like root beer, but the alcohol becomes more present the further you drink, all was very pleasant. You get your drinks very fast always even when it's packed.   I got crazy with the beer, sorry.. not sorry. I highly reccomend this place to anyone, the atmosphere is loud and usually packed only bad thing i can say about Yard House. So far I have been to 2 locations and they're both nice. Tv's everywhere like you'd expect for a bar. Don't look at them, try taking in the experience. You wont forget it likely. 15 minute wait most of the time, worth the wait. Prices are reasonable.  Eat, drink, be marry, drink, and enjoy Yard House.",

They have an excellent beer selection, which is the primary reason I keep coming back.   A buddy and I hit the Yardhouse for dinner this last Saturday before the UFC fight. The wait was fine, and we were seated a nice corner booth. The young lady who sat me was super friendly and attentive. Once my buddy arrived, we had to wait far longer then usual for our waitress to grab drink orders and refills (which were beers).   The calamari appetizer was on point. I ordered carnitas and pork belly tacos, which comes with a side of rice and beans. When the food arrived, it was cold and I was to hungry to send it back. The carnitas taco was flavorful, but the pork belly (which was a micro portion of meat) was bland, and the fatty part was not crispy, which is how I've always had pork belly served. Couple that with being cold, and I spit the fat out into the napkin. Gross. Maybe the pork belly bao at Fat Choy restaurant has ruined me when it comes to pork belly.   My buddies fish & chips were good, with a healthy serving of fries. I hope the food issue was just a bad night for Yardhouse. In the past, I've always enjoyed the food. I hope they get it fixed, especially with all the close by competition in Town Square. Cheers!",

Believe the hype when people say that Yard House has some of the best foods you'll eat. Not to mention (pardon me for not being of legal drinking age just yet) that they have one of the largest selections of draft beers and alcoholic specials! I've had a few of their salads, a pizza or two, (the best) mac and cheese, and almost all of their appetizers and they are nothing shy of incredible. During their happy hour, they offer a bunch of specials such as $2 select drinks and half of select appetizers and pizzas, can't go wrong! My friends and I will normally come between classes for a huuuuge plate of their chicken nachos during happy hour.  Needless to say, Yard House takes the cake on food and service in my book.",

When we arrived that Friday we where told it would be an hour and a half wait.  Upon hearing this we explained that we had tried to make a reservation earlier without success and a manager was then called in to assist us.  Jason was the manager who was sympathetic to our dilemma and had us seated within 15 minutes even though the rest of our party was five minutes behind that.  Jason handled things very professionally unlike most service workers in this town that treat you like you're bothering them.  Because of his actions we will make Yardhouse our go to when in Town Square.  The food is excellent and we've always been treated well by the staff.

    "text": "We left the sugar factory across the road because I knew that no matter what u order at the yard house the food is always fresh and delicious. Well just as expected we ordered off the happy hour menu, my favorite the poke bowl, chicken lettuce wraps and egg rolls. Our waiter nick, offered great service, and was attentive,  he always had a smile on his face no matter how many times we called him. The yard house is my favorite place to eat because you can be guaranteed you will get a good meal,  and great service,  I prefer this location at town square because the service definitely quicker, especially when one is hungry. It's also a great place to watch the games,  if you want to escape the heat,  inside dining is very cool....w",

    "text": "This is a standard yard house. It has a great beer selection, though it usually doesn't include super rare beers. This location had a beer from Utah, Uinta, which was cool.   I shared the Poke Stack and Fish Taco Plate (includes rice and beans). The food was decent, though nothing exceptional. The Poke Stack had a light wasabi soy sauce and came between a couple wantons. It had a small serving of avocado that was fanned out. This made the avocado on the plate hard to share. The fish tacos were decent, but lacked the flavor I'm accustomed to in San Diego. It could have used something to brighten it up. Perhaps mango pineapple? At any rate, it was lacking that tang that makes fish tacos pop. The beans were also just okay, as was the rice. Actually, the rice was pretty oily. Maybe it was stir fried?    The service was great: it was prompt, helpful, and polite.",

    "text": "After and independent of a UYE, when I join my Yelp friends for socializing at the Yard House, it becomes the Yelp House. The Yard House is a fun place for groups of friends to hang out over beer and good food. The restaurant does a commendable job accommodating large groups. Both times that I went to the Yard House we had no problem getting a large table. The service is precise. And when it is time to pay, we had our own checks. Substitute Yelpers for a gathering of general friends, or a date and the Yard House is everybody's social house.    The Yard House is my choice chain restaurant for beer selection. The Yard House is to beer what Baskin Robbins is to ice cream. Whereas Baskin Robbins features 31 flavors of ice cream,, the Yard House features approximately 600 flavors of beer (I counted the beer listed in the menu). If I were to go to the Yard House one Friday a week to order a flavor of beer, according to my math it would take me 12 years to done this. Or if I were to go to the Yard House everyday to try a flavor of beer, it would take me 2 years to do this. Some of the beers may have been listed under a couple of different headings. The deal is that the Yard House selection of beer is as good as it gets.     There are eleven series of beer. There is the chalkboard series. The cider series is the seasonals. The light beer is less than 5.8% alcohol content. This series includes many of the name brands such as Michelob and Budweiser. There is the Honey Fruit series which includes BBC Strawberry Blonde and Blue Point Blueberry. There is the wheat series that includes Blue Hawaiin Hefeweizen. The Malty series includes Bass Ale and Alaskin Amber. The Dark series includes Big Sky Moose Drool and Bison Organic Chocolate. The bitter series includes Anchor Liberty and Blue Point Hoptical Illusion. And there is the Strong and Effervescent series. The menu lists the alcohol content. Unless I overlooked something, the Allagash Curieux is the strongest at 11% alcohol content. There are three sizes of beer. I went for the middle size which is the pint. For the record I greatly appreciated the Firestone.    This very Yard House features a Happy Hour and Late Night Specials. The Happy Hour is Monday-Friday 3-6 pm and Late Night Special Sunday-Wednesday 10-close. They include domestic pints from $4.25-$5.75, well drinks $4.27-$4.75 and wine by glass $2 off. If you are up to food there are half price appetizers & pizza.    The food is good but I've tasted better. My complaint about the roasted turkey club is that it was layers of sandwich instead of the sandwich I am accustomed to. The classic cheeseburger was a good choice. The fries are these skinny things that remind me of potato sticks. I feel that the Yard House ought to expand their fries selection to include steak fries and just thicker fries.    When I socialize at a restaurant, I am big on the music that is playing. I was won over by the music playing. I heard great music from Led Zeppelin, the Rolling Stones and classic rock era.    The Yard House excells at their selection of beer. Whether it is my Yelp House or social House I intend to return. When I return I plan to try the Blue Point Blueberry beer that is brewed in Blue Point, NY; 5 miles south of where I lived. Gotta be patriotic to my home town.  Daniel. S Yelp 100 Challenge.

I don't like to proclaim myself a beer connoisseur for two reasons: I don't know THAT much about beer and I dont particularly like the term or label. With that being said, this is a great spot for a fan of beer, such as myself. Whether you like all types of beers or not, its pleasant to have the option just incase your preferences change over time (as most of ours do).   The menu is fantastic. I only order \"vegan\" as of late but I've never had a bad meal. The \"rotating\" draft beer board keeps the extensive beer menu fresh for those who are regular visitors. Out of the twenty or so times if been here, I've only recieved bad service once.",

    "text": "This is probably the best restaurant at town square in $$ range for food and drinks. I love going to this place, because its located right across from the movie theater. My friends and I usually go here for a movie and dinner night. Food is amazing at this location.   I am a big fan of chicken nahos, its just loaded with chicken, guac, beans, etc. Its a great starter for a big group. Hungry folks will devour it immediately. If you are going there with just another person, than don't get it. Its too big for both, and you can't take it home cause it will get soggy. My favorite are their ahi sliders. They are just delicious. The fish is fresh and its hint of citrus. Its a must have for anyone who's trying to eat healthy.     They also have awesome beer selection, it could be bit more pricy than other local places, but the variety negates the higher price on beers.   Overall, if you are hungry and if you are anywhere near town square than go here. On weekends, if does get really busy so if you have a big party than you might end up waiting for 15-30 minutes. I am not sure if you can reserve ahead of time.",

Only reason for -1 star... the wait for the food took almost an hour to get to us! I think that's really long! Hopefully if I ever come back under 30 mins would be nice.

I was thirsty and this hit the spot.   For an app, we had had the onion ring tower once before and my husband ordered it again. It was just like our previous version, just fried onion rings served with dipping sauce, it was just okay.   I wanted to try the french onion soup and I could add that to my pastrami sandwich. The soup was really good, served with deep rich flavors of the beef broth and onions all covered with melted cheese and under cover, the french baguette bread. Very good soup.   My pastrami sandwich was served with pickle and fries and had a fair amount of meat. It was served on fresh bread and was a decent size, my husband had ordered the seared tuna sandwich and we decided to trade off, he took half mine and I took half his. I do have to admit, my pastrami was better. The tuna was lightly seared and seemed fresh, but I like my tuna sashimi style without any bread!   We did enjoy the meal, however, I guess it's not an impressive place for eating. Since their focus is on the over 100 beers served, this is more of a drinking place.",

There's honestly nothing better than seeing a million taps in front of you, especially if you're the person who prefers beers on tap over any other alcoholic beverage.  My usual is the house honey blonde, but I do enjoy changing it up for darker beers or different flavors sometimes.  I usually end up sitting at the bar because at a table the service is hit or miss.  This isn't to say the service at the bar is a million times better, but I definitely enjoy the bar more than a table.    As for the food I have my usuals that I always go to.  Yard House to this day still has some of the best truffle fries I have ever had.  Sometimes I've been disappointed with them coming out soggy, but flavor-wise, they're still on point!  I love the queso here as well!  I tend order those two as my meal and call it a day.    Yard House at Town Square is definitely an easy staple in my life.  It is half way between my apartment and my best friend's apartment and we love the beer selection!  Other than the service, there really isn't anything I can complain about!

    "text": "Mac n Cheese Squared!  That's all I have to say.  Everyone else was trying to be healthy by eating a fish dish and salad or soup and salad, but c'mon when in a new place you have to try the signature dishes.  The Mac and Cheese Squared didn't look even close to what you might get out of a Kraft box.  Instead it is a white gooey cheese pasta (not elbows) with mushrooms, bacon (big pieces), and a vegetable (?).  Absolutely delicious.  But wait, one of the most important things....the decor.  You walk in and to your left is an enclosed room full of kegs.  You can see in via the glass and view the lines running from the kegs up to the ceiling.  Then you see huge chrome pipes running across the ceiling through the foyer into the restaurant and across to the center bar.  To add perspective we are taking about a hundred beers.  Dafe",

Being that it's a huge establishment, wondered how the service would be... right off, the hostess was friendly, helpful and attentive which channeled all the way to the waitresses as well. For being quite crowded, service was quite outstanding.  The meal - Order the NY Steak and fries... yes, I am predictable! For not being an actual steakhouse, the steak was quite flavorful and tasty, more importantly cooked to order. Not bad at all. Patricia order the Malibu chicken and that looked great as well. Great in a sense when you see someone elses plate, one remarks 'man, I should've ordered that!' LOL  For appetizers... recommend the Chicken Nachos.... ah there very good.  Overall, great dinner and service and wonderful environment. Again, a place definitely worth revisiting!",

We got a table after a few minutes and instantly the manger Leo came over and informed us that they would serve us all the food we wanted, but we were limited to one drink a piece. We were cut off before even walking in the door because we were a group having fun together. I had 1 martini 2 hours prior and a ton of water, but I was cut off! Unbelievable! I will NEVER be back here. I can get drinks anywhere and the food is mediocre at best. I would rather go to the corner bar with better food. If you are in Town Square and looking for a good place with good food go to McFadden's instead. F this place",

I really loved the atmosphere, low lights, with candles on the tables. Plenty of televisions around the restaurant with sports on. The alcohol menu was unbelievable with all the options of beer, anything you could possibly think of. One that caught my eye which i SADLY did not get to try was an actual Beer Float. MMmm sounds tasty! For dinner I ordered the turkey club, which was absolutely AHHHmazing! My husband ordered the barbecue bacon cheeseburger which he downed within a matter of seconds! The only downside is there is no military discount!! We will definitely be making a second or third or maybe even fourth trip there again! :)",

I has a ceaser salad that was amazing, the roommate had a seafood dish that looked great, and that was paired with both of the daily flights (they have 6 beers preselected and bring them to you on little planks in 8oz tasting glasses). and a few from the menu.  I just moved to vegas and I must say that this place is top notch, a definite for me, I miss the Flying Saucer, luckily I have this place whenever I need my beer fix.  They also have a nice outdoor patio, I haven't been out there yet, but I can see many a night drinking a pint and enjoying the desert evenings there.  I really need to get there during happy hour for reduced price beers, while I do my best to drink my way through the beer list!!!",

    "text": "Great food, huge draft-beer selection. Don't get the house beers as they are just mediocre and there are many excellent other beers to order. My big problem with this place, though, is the beer pricing. If you come during happy hour, fine, the prices are clearly stated on the menu. And actually, during happy hour, the beers are priced fairly, not really cheap, but fair, and the happy-hour appetizers are great deals and delicious.  But if you come outside of happy hour, there are no prices listed for beers. There are hundreds of beers and they all are priced differently. Asking a waiter brings a vague response: \"The most expensive one is $8.50 so most of them are less than that.\" But they ain't much less! It's easy to spend $7 on a pint without realizing it. So...insist that the waiter give you the price of each beer before you order. Or, better plan, come only during happy hour.",

He went back to the kitchen to ensure that the product was purely vegan!  Not only that he was very accommodating with her order.  (She got the gardin spicy chicken sandwich).  She said it was tasty & would come back.  I had the Turkey Burger which was one of the best tasting burgers I've had in a long time.  Since I didn't Want fries Mitch patiently ran down my other options until I decided (on mixed veggies which were crisp & not covered in butter & crap).  My mom got the beef sliders & she was very pleased.  We will all come back again since the service was Fab & they are vegan friendly!",

Happy hour deals are not great compared to many places, and not even a deal compared to some normal prices. You pay for the location and trendiness at all Yard House's, and they are a deal compared to casinos or others such as Tommy Bahama's at Town Square.  I have found all Yard Houses to have poor service, so suggest corporate implement a revamped training and process evaluation.  Seems to be enough workers, so that is not the problem that I usually see. The beers seem warm, and are in warm or room temp which makes it go down more slowly, and when it is gone, if you are not at the bar, it will sit empty for a long time.  The food is only okay for the price.  There are better places including in Town Square.  Oh and lastly all Yard Houses have acoustics that make it very loud, so hard to carry on conversation with a group.",

From the bachelor-pad-sheik decor and numerous large flatscreens, to the cute and friendly waitstaff, and who could forget, the wonderful food and huge beer selection, this place is a winner.  I'm not sure what problems some other reviewers had with the kitchen at this place, but they were on top of their game the afternoon I dropped by.  The Korean BBQ appetizer didn't have as strong a garlic flavor as one would expect, but the meat was perfectly cooked, and the flavor of the meat shone through well.  The rice could have been stickier, though.  The burger I ordered medium was perfectly cooked, and wonderously tender and flavorful.  It certainly goes down as one of the better burgers I've ever had.  The fries were light and crispy, but could have been more numerous.  My friend ordered a very tasty upscale mac'n'cheese which came adorned with perfectly cooked and juicy chicken breast pieces.  The servers were very attentive, and made for a very nice overall experience.  This is definitely the kind of place for you, if you're looking for great food and a relaxed, fun enviornment, but a touch more upscale than that little local hole in the wall.  Whether the goal is after-work unwinding, weekend playtime, or just a nice meal in a comfortable place, the Yard House delivers.",

Umm, yeah that's going to kinda make me a little upset.   I've frequented this location NUMEROUS times, but today was probably a weirder experience. Our server, Jenn seemed very excited to get a nice hefty party of 8 at the table next to us! They seemed like a nice crew, beers and appetizers all around, you know the gang just talking about workflow drama. Our server was definitely more interested in the energy from that table, rather than the quiet somber table of two we had. Don't blame her, make your money girl. I just wish she wasn't so monotone, we are here to get a head change and she's killin the vibe a bit! I couldn't take her recommendations of food seriously because she didn't seem enthusiastic about anything she was naming.   This used to be THE happy hour spot, but lately I've found other hot spots to hit up! The portions have definitely changed over the last few months, which I should have asked if that was a major difference on the menu since my last visit. I enjoyed some skinny margaritas, because I've taken months off of drinking to focus on my fitness so I didn't want to drink my calories in alcohol! They were okay! I definitely felt a buzz but I just wish the drinks came at a consistent pace to keep the vibe going. Other than that, the lemon drop was alright but the skinny cosmo martini is one of the better ones, in my opinion.   The appetizers have changed so much, I'm sure the other reviews have pointed that out as well. I enjoyed the Hawaiian pizza and spinach dip(to die for!) The poke nachos & fried calamari are on such a big plates, I'm not a seafood eater so I felt bad my poor date had to chow all these seafood apps by himself.   Other than that, I feel sitting at the bar provides you the best service!   UPDATE: 10/2 I just checked my credit card app & it looks like my lovely server Jen changed the numbers on my tip to leave herself a nice $21.46 tip! Man, was I generous or what?! HAH! good thing I caught this talking to my friend about credit cards and debt and stuff haha. Wow, I feel betrayed, however the manager Allison definitely took charge on this one.   I'm still in disbelief that someone changed the numbers on something I AUTHORIZED to an amount they DESIRED. I'm very sad one of my favorite locations would employ someone that could potentially do this on a regular basis. Please double, if not TRIPLE check your receipts before leaving! I'm still in shock. I'll be doing a survey, contacting corporate and going down later this week to verify my signature and speak with management in regards to this.   Wow...",

    "text": "Okay folks! Been busy with school and haven't had a chance to write a review. My apologies for that. I think I am back now. My son was leaving for boot camp and we took him to the Raiders building in Town Square and showed him our seats. We were hungry when we finished looking around and were trying to figure out a place to eat. We all decided on Yard House since we usually have wonderful food and service at the one in Red Rock. Sad to say this was a HUGE disappointment and definitely no where near as good. First off the service was just bland. Not bad and not good. It was like they just didn't care about our table. Let's get to our orders since food is very important. We ordered the chips and guacamole for apps. I ordered the Vampire quesadilla, my son ordered the El Pastor tacos and my wife ordered the carne asada salad. Ugh......all of it was just bad. Guacamole was just bland and the chips were the cheap store bought fake brand that is super thin and breaks when you breath on it. The Vampire Quesadilla was just gross....it was a bit chewy and I think they tried to fry the quesadilla with parmesan cheese which was an EPIC FAIL and talk about no flavor. My son said they were the worst tacos he has ever had. My wife hated the steak on the salad as it was chewy and no flavor. For $70.00 you would have expected more. I just could go on and on about how bad overall it was. Then as we leave the manager gives us the half hearted \"Hope everything was great\" type of comment. Now it has been awhile since I have to been to Yard House but if this is what they are now I will be done with them.",

I ordered just ice water and the turkey sandwich with no tomatoes and no mayo but chipotle ranch instead on it. Food came out and half the sandwich was tomatoes(which I didn't want), bacon was barely there, avocado was mashed and probably a teaspoon on the whole sandwich as well as the turkey was thick (like ham), not sliced. Not sure I would recommend this to someone else. If I hadn't eaten all day I would've gotten up and left.",

I love the Spicy Tuna Roll the most.  It comes out like a layered cake instead of a sushi roll.  I ask for extra Sriracha or course & I love the dehydrated mushrooms on top.  It's shareable!!   The Lobster Garlic Noodles & Chinese Garlic noodles are phenomenal.  Korean Street taco is tasty & I love the chili threads on top.  Pizzas are good & on happy hour.    Hawaiian Mule is our favorite similar to a Moscow Mule.  For beers, if I don't get one of their many different beer flights, I'll get this Watermelon beer that's 10%!  It's nothing like a framboise, it's only a slight watermelon aroma, but taste like beer.  There's also a flight that's usually has it on the list to try.   Ambiance is similar to any sports type bar.  I always sit at the bar & located next to the movie theater so perfect spot!    Cheers!",

So we walked around the bar and meantime, I counted 17 open tables of 4-6 people, not counting outside tables that were open. All 17 tables were ready for someone to seat them, but 5 minutes later, they still didn't seat anyone. We got a spot at the bar and when I returned my buzzer, they only sat one couple at a 6 person booth - speak of inefficiencies.  Sitting at the bar, there's at least 6 open tables within spitting distance of me, still open after we've been seating at the bar for the last 10 minutes. And two more tables waiting to be cleaned. I'm shocked their wait was that long and they've only seated one party of two since we arrived.",

It was not presented until the check came, so it was not a factor with regard to the service we received.  My previous review gave YH 4 stars, with the only problem being slow service, especially when it came to getting the check.   Tonight, it seems as though my input was taken seriously; all the issues are no longer issues! The meal was very well timed, with the drinks, appetizer and main courses arriving as we needed them. We got the check at the same time our dinner plates were bussed, so we were able to pay it and then relax for a few minutes before leaving (my biggest complaint before was that we were often held hostage for a while after the meal because of the check not being presented quickly). All in all, great service!  As per usual, my seared ahi sandwich was AMAZING. The kitchen gods smiled upon me today and I ended up with TWO tuna steaks in my sandwich, instead of the usual one. Loved it!",

I was here this past weekend 3/12 with a group of about 6-7 girls and our server was an older gentleman named \"Chris\". First of all, he had the worst attitude on this planet. We were waiting on a couple girls to join us (they were literally minutes away) and him and his boss (who I don't know his name) kept asking us if they were on their way, after several times of telling them YES THEY ARE PARKING they must of got the hint. It literally took them an hour to bring out our food, we hardly even ordered anything besides appetizers and drinks. My friend ordered a Lemon Drop martini and it was barely filled to the top WITH NO SUGAR around the rim. Was this for a kid, perhaps? Baby size Lemon Drop Martini. I think they finally got it right the second time around...mind you these drinks are not cheap but they sure are cheap as far as the amount they give you. So, we were on a time crunch and finally our food comes out. My pasta was absolutely DISGUSTING. It's like they took the pasta, chicken and threw in a can of some type of creamy sauce. Had no flavor to it whatsoever!! I always order this meal at the Yard House at Red Rock and it's always so amazing. NOT THIS LOCATION. Our server Chris, was terrible. His attitude was so rude, like he was rushing us but as soon as we asked the status of our order he seemed to have tude. It definitely seemed like he hated his job. Don't work in this industry or high pressure environment if you can't handle it. If you're going to work in the food industry and serving people make sure you fix your attitude or take your damn happy pills. This is not the first time I've experience terrible service here. I will never go to this location again. Save yourself time and avoid this place at all cost.",

First off, our server Zack, waited a very long time before he even came to our table, and when he did, he complained about the amount of tables he already had. My friends and I then order the chicken tenders requesting bbq and hot sauce on the side his response was \"can you remind me when the food comes out? The kitchen won't do that, I'll have to do it.\" Why don't you be a little proactive and get it so our food won't get cold while you're fetching the sauce we orders ahead of time. My friend order Korean short rib tacos, a dish she has had many times. When the food came out she questioned it and the severs argued with her telling her it was correct. One even told her to take a bite to double check. They sent out a replacement taco, which looked completely different from the original. Zack still continued to argue it was still correct after the fact, we requested a manager to come over. As soon as the manager looked he said that is a pork belly taco, we then explained out concerns of the entire evening. He then confirmed that the tacos were entered wrong and that he removed them off the bill, he also took 50% off the tab. The manager did a nice job at trying to recover the service, but it will be a long time before I return to Yardhouse, a celebration turned into many issues after another.",

It's a great place because it's not just a bar so coworkers under 21 can still come but for anyone who would like a drink it's perfect. Plus if anyone wants to stay later and drink the bar is right in the middle. Will always be a favorite.",

I can't even count the amount of times I come here.  Our new faves we've discovered:  Tortilla soup (the bf loves loves loves he gets a whole bowl) and the turkey burger.  That turkey patty is fricken delish!  I would do it protein style and its just fricken good. Just wish there's was better phone reception here (any att local knows it just sucks). LOL",

    "text": "I admit it, I'm a Yard House whore.   I seriously love this place. The restaurant has such a chill and laid back vibe. It's huge and has ample seating. They have nice cushiony booths so if you and a date come by then you can have a semi-romantic dinner on one of those. Want to sit outside? They have a nice patio area in which they have heaters for the chillier days. They have TVs all over the place with different channels. Games are on most of the time. If you want to watch a specific game on a specific TV, all you have to do is ask.  I'm not a big beer person. But Yard House is the one place I will indulge in a glass (or two...or three...). My favorite beer is the Lindeman's Framboise. A Belgian lambic beer, it has the perfect cidery raspberry taste. They serve it in some sort of champagne glass - it makes me want to pinky up because I feel almost sophisticated drinking it! I also love their fruit ciders, especially their pear cider. The Snakebite is also divine - it's a blend of the pear cider and harp. Besides their beer, they have pretty good specialty mixed drinks. One that comes to mind is their Pomegranate Margarita. Tart and pomegranite-y with a pretty presentation!  Their food awesome! My faves are listed below:  [Before i list specific food items, I'd like to say that Yard House has really really good fries. They're super thin and super addicting. If you're into the thick cut steak fries, you won't find them here]  Appetizers - Seared Ahi Sashimi: About 6 pieces of seared tuna covered in soy vinaigrette is served next to a small bed of red cabbage also covered in the vinaigrette. I really like this dish when it's made right. Sometimes they over-drench the sashimi pieces and the dish becomes ultra salty. - Onion Ring Tower: Literally, the name says it all. It's apparently beer battered and comes with a chipotle ketchup and ranch dressing.  - Spicy Tuna Roll: If you're expecting a typical sushi roll, then don't. This is served without rice and as a stack. Bottom layer are edamame and cucumbers. Middle layer is your tuna and the top layer is the avocado. It's a pretty dish. Very innovative.  - Sliders: Specifically the bearnaise or ahi sliders. Four sliders plus a handful of fries. They call this an appetizer, but the portions are not appetizer-like!  Entree - Mac & Cheese squared: Chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. Can't go wrong with this one. They use wild mushrooms that elevated your boring mac & cheese to the next level.  [This is it for entrees. I usually stick with their appetizers.]  Dessert - Chocolate souffle: Small souffle good for one. Scoop of vanilla ice cream on top with mint garnish. Do not leave without trying this. I'm seriously serious.   Yard House has great happy hour. 3 PM - 6 PM Monday - Friday and 10 PM - close Sunday - Thursday. Drink specials and half off on a lot of their appetizers! Their sliders are discounted as well. Perfect late night meal.",

We were a party of 6 last night and we sat out the patio. The service was very quick and friendly, although the place was mostly empty. Our waiter was a bit of a low talker so it was very hard to hear him throughout the meal.   We sat outside on the patio and I ordered the BBQ chicken salad which was excellent, little spicy but oh so good. This place is a great place to have a nice meal and a few drinks, while watching a game on TV.   Def will be back for more.",

We were seated promptly but I wish they would get rid of the tables and just have booths because sitting at a table makes you feel like you are on display! The beer was excellent as usual but this is the first time in probably 40 times we have been here that the service was really bad. I think everyone was having the same problem because I watched some people get up and go to the bar to order their own drinks or chase down their waitress. Perhaps they were understaffed that day or they just had a bunch of retards working! The food was slow but good. I had the fried chicked and my wife had the fish taco plate. Both were cooked to our liking - even though they came to our table on the slow boat!  I'm sure the service problems were just a one time thing so we'll be back again for another review! I hope they can get back to 5 stars because I really enjoy this place when everything is working as intended!",

After a good 10 minutes, I finally got my drink and, at the same time, mi amigas showed up ready to eat.  As crowds started to pile in for dinner, my very bright red disco-light pager thing went off. We were seated in one of their very long booths, that can take forever to get out of if you're sitting by the wall.  We had the pleasure of having a waiter who was training a newbie (shadowing).  It's cool to train new staff, but it seemed like our \"veteran\" waiter had difficulty multi-tasking with serving, remembering small stuff, and training.  Other waiters were gracious enough to help out.     The large selection of beers, happy hour, and the fact that it's located in the new Town Square mall, away from casinos, inspires me to come back.  My new favorites at YH are the mouth-freakin-watering Ahi dishes (ahi crunchy salad and seared ahi sashimi appetizer), lettuce wraps, and the lobster-crab-artichoke dip.  Mi amiga's grilled rib eye steak was not cooked to her specs, so she returned it.  Next thing you know, the general manager personally serves her a new rib eye steak done right...on the house.  Now that's the way to do it!",

Tons of TVs, great, varied menu, and obviously TONS of beer.   The highlights: *They offer 6 packs (6 shots) of beer where you can try mini portions of a few - that looked fun, I'll have to try it next time *A sports bar with healthy food! HELL YEAH. 250 calories for their Crunchy Ahi Tuna salad. It was tasty and satisfying.. and guiltless ! I paired it with a light beer for a great dinner.. yum. *as many have said - hot clientele! And from catching passing glances of the IDs flying around it appears most people are locals.   ** - 1 star for the sub par service. Even at the bar it was hard to get a beer.",

    "text": "Strike 2 against Yard House.  My last review wasn't exactly positive, which is to be expected when you get moldy bread on your sandwich and don't notice (due to your hunger) until after devouring HALF of the thing. Yuck.  After that experience I received an e-mail from the manager apologizing and offering a free dinner.  I never responded and hadn't been back since.  I don't want free things, I just want your kitchen to send out non-moldy bread!  Anyhow, my Mom and I were in the area and decided to stop in on a Sunday night for dinner.  It was pretty crowded, but we were sat immediately and approached by a friendly server, who took our drinks/appetizer order.  I have to add....if you know anything about beer, the list is nothing but long.  There is really nothing exciting about it.  Anyhow, our beers came out quickly and our server took our order.  I figured our app should be out any minute, but instead we sat there waiting and waiting and waiting....until BOOM! Our entrees came out.  We told the food runner that we never received our app, and he said he would be happy to take our food back and have our app sent out, or he could just make sure we aren't charged for it and leave our dinner.  Uh, no....we are hungry and ordered an app, we want it.  So he takes our food back and I start worrying that I am going to either end up with moldy bread again, or our entrees were going to sit under a heat lamp until we were ready for them.....I saw our server talking with a Manager, who then came over to our table to apologize for the error and that our crab/lobster/artichoke dip would be out momentarily and that she would ensure our meals were made fresh. (Also that the app would be no charge) Once we received it, the dip was really good and it disappeared quickly.  Our entrees were fresh when we received them, and I did not have moldy bread. (WHEW!) Our server also apologized and said that it was his error, which I know isn't easy.  Now, all of this may not seem like that big of a deal, but after my previous experience and having not returned to the restaurant in over a year after the moldy bread, it is just really disappointing.  I used to go to Yard House almost every Sunday with a big group of friends, and we loved the food and service.  Now it seems like both have gone downhill and I am not sure if I will find another reason to go back.  It was very generous of the manager to comp our app, but I am not looking for free food.  I just want my order to come out correctly, in a timely manner, and without mold. Is that too much to ask?  Apparently so.  Unfortunately, I think that Yard House has gotten lost in the shuffle of getting tourists in and out as quickly as possible....  Just an FYI....I was a server in college and I understand that mistakes happen.  Our server still received 20% tip after this debacle, as I only thought it was fair to tip based off what the check would have been, if the appetizer would've been charged.",

Shrimp Ceviche - 3.5 Stars - Normally full of shrimp and fruit, but this time the shrimp was lacking, so to me it was more of a fruit ceviche. Still full of flavor and seasoned well, just lacking on the main ingredient.  Shrimp Caesar Salad - 4 Stars - 4 Jumbo Shrimp cooked perfectly. Nice and tender and full of flavor. Perfect amount of cheese crisps and croutons, only lacking was the amount of dressing.   Spinach Cheese Dip - 5 Stars - Always awesome and full of flavor. The chips work so well with the dip and the portion size is perfect.  Angel Hair Pasta w/ Shrimp - 5 Stars - Pasta cooked perfectly. Sauce is on point and full of flavor. Large amount of shrimp. Portion size is perfect for sharing.  Turkey Pot Pie 3.5 Stars - First time having this dish here and was expecting a little more from the dish. The puff pastry was underdone, so it was greasy and not very edible. There were far too many leeks in the dish, so it tasted like turkey and onions which is not bad for me since i love onions, but it was just lacking in other flavors. On a positive note, there was a ton of turkey, so that was a huge positive.  Salted Caramel Pudding - 5 Stars - Can never get enough go this dessert. Always good, just wish it was a bit larger of a portion.",

We had a group of 18 and didn't make reservations, the manager got us seated as soon as possible. Our servers took our drink and food orders quickly and made sure the little kids got their food first. Everyone was pleased with their meals and one of our servers brought over a free habanero beer sampler for my brother. The staff were patient with us as we were a large group and didn't seem to mind all the kids running around. The service here was great and I really appreciated that.",

However, some of their other food doesn't quite live up to that standard.  Burgers are ok, but not great.  Sandwiches are ok, but not great.   All in all though it's a fun place to hang out and drink beers and eat decent food.  Kind of heavy on the douchebags on Fri and Sat nights but honestly that goes for most of Town Square.  What's with that?",

I love the atmosphere and the one draw back is that it seems everyone else always has the same idea to go when I do.  So my only suggestion is to arrive to be pleased, have fun, and above all patient to be seated or find a spot at the bar.    My most recent excursion was for an ill advised late night snack that had me succumb to the delicious Calimari.  I do love to order this dish in many places but I always love how here it's prepared fresh and hot, and rather quickly and accompanied with the spicy tomato and tartar sauce.  I love the plentiful dipping sauce and attentive service for more on request.  I also appreciate how this is a place that serves fresh brewed ice tea for those of us in a hiatus from imbibing the many beers available on tap.   So if you're a drinker, have plenty of hungry friends, love ice tea, and just want a fun time, check out Yard House.",

We sat at the bar cause there was a half hour wait for a table our bartender was Juan, after ordering drinks we ordered our 1st appetizer, boneless wings with barbecue sauce. What we got was wings in hot sauce so after waiting for someone to check on us they reordered the correct wings only to still come with hot sauce. Juan said at least we are consistent. At this point Jon took over and offered us a free round of drinks only find out at checkout he only gave my girlfriend a free drink and charged for mine. We didn't order anymore food after that. On top of all this an NFL game was on and they kept changing the station. Not cool for a sports theme at the bar. I work near Town Square and have lunch there at least 3 times a week, but I'll be taking YardHouse out of the rotation.",

Unfortunately, there aren't many good* experiences we have at Yard House. Bartenders aren't very hospitable here, we rarely have an experience worth coming for. Kat is literally the only warm bartender we enjoy who has ever been nice to us and not waited like 10 minutes to greet us.... even just give us coasters + acknowledge us! I hate being so quick to judge when in the industry, but when MORE THAN 3 strikes have been given because \"we understand\".... no, that's just unacceptable. Especially when, and don't take it as we're cheap by any means, we're paying about $11/cocktail-- that's an awful lot for cheap service. We'd so much rather go to Miller's for a $4 drink and get better attentive service.... especially from those you KNOOOW are going to take care of you. Many people tell us that the staff at Yard House comes across as awfully snooty and as if they're \"the shit\"-- alas, I understand their point of view. Too bad they have freakin good food and late night happy hour haha we will still come, it's just a matter of what kind of service we're in the mood for and if the food is worth that kind of service haha. Food, Yard House will always win. Drinks, meeeehh.... can't get a friendly bartender here =/",

At first they messed up our drink orders.. we shrugged it off.. no big deal.. Then they bring half the table their food and just never came back with the other half. After having to get up to find a manager we still had to wait 15-20 minutes for it. Then they bring out the completely wrong food.. So we send it back.. then another 20 minutes goes by and the first half of the table is done and ready to go.. Then finally they bring out the food. Two of which items were burgers that were ordered medium rare and came out burnt.. To make matters worse the server never came back for drink refills and we eventually had to find someone to do that for us as well. It was embarrassing especially since I made the recommendation to go there (having been there only one time before just to drink)  Just about everyone at the table who was a first timer said they would never be back, and I dont blame them.",

But when I have one of those \"ah screw it\" moment I get the mac and cheese squared. I think it only has 398,000 calories which 397,456 are from fat but how can you resist? Different types of cheeses, chicken, bacon, mushrooms, truffle oil. I think i may be bold enough to say its one of the best macaroni and cheese dishes you may have.  I think everything I've had here has been decently good, when i try and eat healthy I'll order their chicken and veggie bowl. It probably has enough salt to flavor a sunflower seed factory but for it being somewhat low in fat and full in veggies, its pretty good. All in all not too many complaints, bad for my cholesterol levels and liver but hey we can still be friends Yardhouse.",

We ordered drinks, I had a half yard of Anderson Valley Wild Turkey Bourbon Stout and my girlfriend had a Pineapple Express cocktail, both delicious! We started with the chicken nachos, really good, they used poached chicken, kinda weird, but still delicious! She had the lamb burger and I had the blackened chicken torta sandwich! Both equally awesome! If the food and service wasn't good enough, the manager, I assume based on his outfit, stopped by the table to check on our experience! Level 5 service right there!

The Ahi Poke bowl I'd give a thumbs up. Don't get the burger though , it's was underwhelming. As for their beer selection , it's really something.

Our server was very nice and apologized for the long waits for food. Maybe as a bar this place is better for customers but I wouldn't go again for the food.",

I gave the yard house 3 stars rating the food items.  Everytime I've come here the food is OK. It looks appealing but I feel that it really lacks flavor or any excitement. I had the spicy tuna roll which is a nontraditional roll. It has avocados and edamame with spicy tuna in between. It sure looks and sounds good but the flavor was MEH. I also tried the ahi sliders and they just weren't good.   See for yourself.   3 stars because the beer selection is obviously fun but other than that I'd honestly go some place else for my carb in a cup fill to at least get some decent food to complement it.",

One caution though:  make SURE that if you order the super-yummy Gardein Orange Peel Chicken that you specifically say you want the VEGAN orange peel chicken.  They also serve this dish as a regular menu item and you don't want to make the mistake of getting real chicken thinking you are eating vegan.

The lobster/burger combo was fantastic, it may not be the best burger I've ever had in my life but I would say it gets an honorable mention. I ordered mine with sweet potato fries that came with a maple bacon sauce, can't go wrong there. I also had a bite of the Garlic Chicken Noodles, it was also great.",

So my boyfriend waives Jason over as he is walking and was just asking about the cake. And Jason just shrugs his shoulder and said \"i don't make the cakes here, they are preparing it.\" Jason comes back with the cake, lights the candle, drops off the cake and then walks away. Maybe he was having a bad day..I just thought it was really awkward and rude to say he doesn't make the cakes..I mean obviously he wouldn't be a server if he was making the cake. He could have been nicer about the situation, like a thumbs up, or \"it will be here shortly. \"",

I like this specific Yard House as it's in the Town Square plaza with plenty of the \"Outdoor Experience\" atmosphere surrounding it. And once your meal wraps up there is so much to do.   Parking is easy as it's in the TS lot.   Food is awesome. The Rib Eye, burgers, and onion rings are probably my favorite. Service is prompt even when they provide you with a pager.   The number of beers on tap they have is insane. I forget exactly how many (triple digits maybe?), however, they are as plentiful as their TV screen setup - tons of these too!",

I got to try a lot of things, including a blue crab cake hoagie with house ranch salad (lunch menu), chicken nachos, onion ring tower, fried calamari, and chicken strips w/ fries (disclaimer: didn't double-check the menu, so not all names of food items may be accurate). For some reason, out of all of those, I found myself munching on the fries and dipping them on the honey mustard that accompanied the chicken. I guess the fries were just in the sweet spot of crunchiness and fluffiness, and the honey mustard was way too addictive. I can't speak for the beer, but everybody at my table seemed to enjoy theirs and they have a huge selection. Finally,  gotta love a place that plays some Beatles and some George Harrison.  I also wanted to add a tip for finding this place. Gotta locate it before you can enjoy it, you know? It's kinda hidden if you're driving along most of the streets, so locate it on a map of Town Square beforehand or else just park somewhere and walk around. I think it might be best if you park near H&M and take the alley that starts off with the sushi bar and Yogurtland, then walk past the \"clearing\" in the middle. You should see it on the right.",

We had a few questions about different menu items and he was very informative and helpful!  Plus he had a great quirky personality that makes him a great waiter!  Since it was Happy Hour, they have many 1/2 price appetizers and deals on drinks.  We decided to split the Chicken Nachos and Bearnaise Sliders.   This was a fantastic deal as our nachos ended up only being about 5.50 and the sliders were around 6.50.  The chicken nachos were delivered on a huge plate!  This plate alone would have actually been enough for both of our stomachs to be filled.  They had a great combination of ingredients with plenty of chicken spread throughout the nachos.  Fabulous!   The sliders came out with 4 on the plate and a side of shoestring fries. I didn't see that fries were included so that was a bonus.  Plus I love shoestring style french fries.  Yum.  The sliders were just ok.  I almost wish we ordered the classic style sliders.  Yes I did love the bearnaise sauce that accompanied the sliders on the side but the burger itself was very plain.  It still enjoyed them.    Their dining area itself is spacious and roomy.  There are plenty of seating inside and on their outdoor patio.  Everything was kept very clean and tidy! It doesn't hurt to see their keg room when you first walk in...  puts a smile on my husbands face!  It is a great place whether you are visiting or a local.",

We always came as a big group (between 10 and 24) and the staff was always accommodating from putting tables together to separating each and every single check.   Their happy hour menu features quite a selection. Their chicken nachos were always popular for the guys in our group. The serving is huge so it can definitely be shared by 4-6 people. Onion ring tower is delicious, it comes with ranch and some other sauce. The other sauce is delicious, I just don't know what it is. The garlic chicken noodles is my favorite thing on their happy hour menu, it has a lot of flavor and is definitely good enough for a meal even though it's listed as an appetizer. My friends have ordered almost all the pizzas their and they're nothing special. Although I am from New York so I'm a pizza snob lol. Spinach dip is also yummy but very rich.   Our favorite drinks are the ciders especially the pear and raspberry ones. My friends have ordered  many different kinds of ales, beers, etc and have enjoyed each and every one.   Recently, we came for lunch and I ordered their lunch special. It consisted of either a pizza or sandwich with soup or salad. I had the pastrami sandwich with clam chowder. The pastrami sandwich lacked cheese and mustard but did come served with jalapenos. It was good but not quite what I expected. The clam chowder was yummy and I wished I had just ordered that by itself.   All in all, it has decent food and definitely a nice place to hangout with some friends.",

Good job Jordan!!",

The staff is super friendly and was always open to helping with anything we needed.  However...  The food was not on par. I tried the hot chicken and a friend friend the southern fried chicken and hubby had the seafood omelette. We all shared the lettuce wraps. All of our food was cold ... My hot chicken was not temperature or spiced hot... The taste just felt it was missing something...  For happy hour I've heard it's worth a deal but our meals at dinner were not worth $16+ a pop...

    "text": "My friends and I stumbled into this place. We were deciding on what place to eat in Town Square and found that this place had the best menu.   Ambiance: 5 - This place had a good energy all around. The host greeted us and was helpful by explaining the happy hour menu. In the center of the restaurant is a bar and all around the room are TVs playing sports. At sunset, they added tea light candles to each table and I thought it had a very nice touch. I highly recommend going to this place if you're looking to watch a game or to have a date night here.  Service: 5 - If I could give higher stars than a 5 I would! Our waiter was incredibly helpful when we were ordering. There were times when it would take a while to get our food but he would make sure that we got our food hot and ready. I definitely would want to have him as my waiter the next time I eat there, if only I could remember his name haha.   Food: 4 - I ordered the Hawaiian pizza and parmesan truffle fries. The Hawaiian pizza was a pretty large size and I was really satisfied with it. The only thing I didn't like about the pizza was it was very thin crust and soggy. I like to have my crust a little fluffy and if I do order thin crust I would like for the bread to have a crisp/crunch to it. The truffle fries were heaven!!! The portion was pretty decent and definitely worth paying for. It wasn't too oily, it had a little crunch, and the parmesan was added just right. I highly recommend ordering the truffle fries!  The next time i'm hungry at Town Square, I will definitely visit this place during happy hour. Great food for an amazing price!",

I think our server told us they have over 300 to choose from. Not being a beer drinker, I was equally impressed with the cider selection. They carried a Woodchuck Autumn blend which can be hard to find in specialty stores let alone a restaurant. They also have many different wines and a full bar so no worries if you don't prefer beer.    The food has always been great. On past occasions I've tried the fish tacos (yummy), Cobb salad (had a twist to your traditional Cobb with edamame beans and corn on it), and blackened salmon with a mango salsa (excellent flavor). There can be a bit of a wait to sit outside but there's usually a spot or two at the bar where you can wait it out and imbibe. Service has always been outstanding and prices are on par with what you'd spend at a trendy Microbrewery.",

She really knows her stuff and seems to genuinely care about answering the questions correctly or going to find out more info. My friend is vegan and every time she asks a questions she seems to get varying answers, which is a little frustrating. But overall this place serves me just right  I usually stop by here on my way home from work or before a night out.  They have a great Happy Hour. Mon-Fri 3pm to 6pm, and Sun-Wed 10 to close. My favorites are the Fat Cat wine and Spicy Tuna roll, even if they ask me if I've ever had it EVERY TIME. Some other favorites are the Mac and Cheese, sans bacon. I know! I know, the horror!  Calamari is also pretty tasty, as well as the chicken appetizer with peanut sauce. I'll also often order a cup of clam chowder (with Tabasco, of course)  I usually end up at the bar, but the patio is also nice.  I rarely sit at a table, but keep in mind there always seems to be a wait.  Also, I'm not much for deserts, but ordered this salted caramel butterscotch pudding desert once and it was amazing. I seriously could not stop eating it. Beware, it's addicting.",

I ordered the Hawaiian Poke Stack which consisted of shredded carrots and ginger, piled onto the poke which was stacked on top of crispy wontons with a side of sliced avocados. It was very delicious but I still prefer the tradition ahi poke with the bits of nori and chopped onions. The portion was kind of small especially for $13! But thank God it was happy hour.   My friend ordered the chicken nachos which is more than enough for 1 person. You need like 3 people to help you finish it. The nachos were very crispy and warm and loaded with cheese, tomatoes, beans, salsa and guacamole on the side. We didn't even finish the whole thing, that's how big it was.   Overall the atmosphere is great, service is great and the food is great. They also have a huge selection of beer :) this is definitely a good get-together spot.",

Service was good and they sat us at the table immediately. We made a reservation beforehand.   We ordered a bunch of stuff so I got to try a little bit of everything. The sweet and sour \"chicken\" off the vegetarian menu was so good!  It's made out of soy but it's crunchy sweet and sticky. I also enjoyed the texture. I got to try the truffle burger and garlic fries. Liked it both. It was good, nothing really special but definitely a solid burger. The fries are cut thin and they were generous with the garlic. I got the angel hair pasta with all kinds of vegetables and olives in the half size. Portion is a little small but I wasn't that hungry so it worked out. I enjoyed it but it wasn't my favorite dish. I kept eyeing other people's food. I think there's too many olives in it.  I also liked their Korean steak dish with rice. It came with sauteed spinach that were delicious.   Since it was a birthday they were nice enough to give the birthday girl a free dessert. Ice cream and a brownie. They also split the check for 20 people. That's amazing!  Love it when places can do that so you don't have to worry about calculating it and splitting the tips and tax. Saved us the headache!  Will definitely come back for their happy hour.",

    "text": "Undoubtedly one of the best Happy Hour specials in Las Vegas, when considering quality and price. Sure, you can go to the neighborhood bar and find $1 beers on tap at odd hours...but the quality offered by Yard House is seldom seen in combination with their prices. Expect to pay $4-5 for a delicious imported beer, $4 wells, or $5-6 for one of their signature martinis and cocktails.   On top of that, their food is delicious. And by delicious, I mean I've never eaten anything there that wasn't. Generously portioned half priced appetizers will undoubtedly keep you satiated to the tune of $6-7, or you can enjoy their sliders or pizza selection for similar pricing.   I rang in my 21st birthday here in 2009, and my friends had a blast exposing me to all sorts of fun delicious drinks - I can give Yard House some credit for the eclectic taste in spirits I have now. Take me seriously when I say, they have beer for EVERYONE. If you hate beer, THEY HAVE BEER FOR YOU. If you love beer, they have 250 of them! If you think beer is tolerable but haven't found one you love yet, get in your car *right now* and go to Yard House. I'm serious. My personal favorites are Goose Island Matilda, a Belgian style pale ale that tastes a little bit fruity with a lot of kick, and Stone Ruination IPA. They always card - ALWAYS - which I also enjoy ;)  The reason they lose a star isn't even really their fault, but it does deserve to be said - cell phone service is RARE. I've received many angry text messages and voicemails after being unreachable for the few hours I spent enjoying my Goose Island Matilda and Ahi Poke Stack. No bueno. However, although Yard House doesn't provide WiFi as stated on this page, Town Square does and I have been known to bring my laptop with me for a working lunch here.   With both afternoon and late night happy hours - you can't lose. Unless you hate food and alcohol and prefer to live in a cave chewing on cardboard. In that place, you should probably get off Yelp.",

I went here with a friend and my boyfriend and we loved the sliders and the sweet potato fries. The few times I got burgers they were pretty good; no real complaints about the burgers. But I wanted to try something new (big mistake) so I decided to order the Ahi Tuna Crispy Salad (something along those lines). Our server was great, which made not enjoying the food kind of a flop.   When I received the salad, the tuna was sliced into maybe 1/4 inch pieces and the edges of each piece was covered in pepper. I do not like a whole bunch of pepper so that was a big disappointment for me. Also, they saturated the salad in salad dressing. I had to send it back because it made it very difficult to each and extremely unappetizing. I tried to enjoy it after they fixed the drenching of the salad and put the dressing on the side, but it was still difficult to enjoy the food. I was highly considering asking them to change the salad into the sliders but I  didn't want to wait even longer to get my food because we waited a while to get my salad and my friend's burger. I was very disappointed and would not recommend getting that salad. I almost did not want to pay for the food because I felt that I did not enjoy the food and I wasted the tuna :(",

    "text": "This is my first time visiting this Yard House location. I can't say I was too pleased with the experience. They not only messed up my tables drink orders but delivered an entirely incorrect meal to one of us. The first server assigned to us had a horrible attitude and seemed bored and impatient. Just a little positivity goes a long way. The young man who relieved him though, he was gracious and very humble. Overall, it wasn't a bad enough time or meal to make me not want to visit this location again but it did leave a bit of a bad taste in my mouth.",

The first time the waiter was rude and didn't even acknowledge us for 20 minutes and then we paid the bill with a giftcard and he almost kept the giftcard! (it still had a balance on it.) we had to ask him for it back which we shouldn't have to do. Both times though it took forever for the food to come out. I ordered the lunch special (pizza and tomato bisque.) and both times half of the tomato bisque was spilled on my plate. I just think this yard house just needs to weave out there bad waiters and they will be fine!",

The first time I ate there I sat at the bar, ordered the lunch special Margherita pizza with a ceaser salad. It was GREAT!  The second time was last Saturday and I ordered The grilled shrimp and was Very disappointed at the small amount of food I got on the grilled shrimp plate (for 15.00) but it was very good.  I went back the next day, ordered Chicken nachos for 12.00 and the plate was HUGE. The food tasted very fresh and every bite was delectable!  Their beer selection is incredible and I can tell they clean their taps often.  The waiter experiences were good 2 out of 3 times.Its hard to find good food that tastes fresh in Vegas and this is my new addiction",

    "text": "This has by far been one of the best happy hour menu's.  They have their sliders, pizza's, and popular appetizers at a low price.  Well, if you bring a big group or if you're sharing for 2.  You can get about 3 to 4 dishes for almost $13.00.    The atmosphere of this place is ok, if you like that fast paced and loud noise ambiance.  It's tolerable, and I have yet to experience bad service.  The servers are quick to get your order, great with drink refills, and the food comes out in less than 20 mins.  (*QUICK NOTE: NEVER EAT HERE, NOT UNLESS IT'S HAPPY HOUR, otherwise you'd be paying $10 - $15 for appetizers and entree's*)   Things to Order:   - Chicken Lettuce Wrap - Ground chicken sauteed with diced mushrooms, onion leaves, and spices, served upon a fried wonton bowl accompanied with 8-9 lettuce wraps.  There are three types of sauces, I think regular, mild and spicy?  I'm not too sure on that, but the regular sauce is my favorite.    - Fried Calamari - Nothing too special, but a definite must have for a vast mix.  The calamari is always fried to a crisp, tossed in a salt a pepper mix served with tartar sauce and a marinara sauce I think?    - Hawaiian Poke Stack - For some reason the fish tastes very fresh, as opposed to other restaurants who try their hardest to execute a poke dish.  Yardhouse I'd say, prepares it well.  Ahi poke tossed in a Hawaiian style marinade, served upon two wonton crisps with soy & sesame oil bean sprouts and carrots.    - Onion Ring Stack - An onion tower served with two types of sauces: ranch and chipotle.  I personally like the chipotle sauce.  The onion rings are fried to perfection, the onions doesn't slip out of the fried batter.    - Chicken Nachos - MMmmMm, a huge plate of nachos served with the toppings of a mexican nacho.  The cheese sizzles when served and the chicken is quite succulent, although the pieces should be chopped up a little more.    - Spinach Dip - My very favorite, spinach and cheese mixed together in a hot mix (not spicy).  Served with largely cut toasted bread instead of chips!  What's even better, they lightly top the bread with parmesan!   This a definite must go to if you're having a get together.  The food is good, and so is the experience.  Another pro to this, is that after eating you can go watch a movie.  Since the movie theatre is in fact right across the building.",

I've been to a few of these and the cool thing is that depending on where you are you can taste a few of the local beers along with staples like Stella, Sam Adams Seasonal, etc.   As far as food goes, this is far from simple bar food. I had the Cuban with tomato bisque and my cousin had the spicy tuna roll. When she ordered the waiter asked, \"Have you had the tuna roll here before?\" she knowingly shook her head yes. The tuna \"roll\" came and let me just say, \"Fabulous!!\" It's shaped like a huge can of tuna not a roll. It has all the ingredients of a spicy tuna roll except for the rice. Instead of rice it sits on a bed of edamame. A delicious red wasabi sauce wraps around it. It's one of those dishes that make you look at your plate and get immediately sad because you didn't order it. Don't get me wrong, the Cuban was amazing but if you like sushi, make sure someone gets that spicy tuna roll! Service was great and there were a plethora of screens for football. Did I mention a yard of beer?",

It's a natural antibacterial cleanser. * Scan Life avail. for those with Smartphones... its on their coasters !!    Okay, this place is another one of those places where service is not really a concern.  Service was a bit slow, but what do you expect from such a busy place during happy hour?  The food is good, especially the Bernaise Sliders (comes with fries).  I found it disappointing that there I wasn't asked how hot I wanted my wings.  I guess I've been spoiled with Buffalo Wild Wings.  I didn't get a chance to sample the pizza, but my friend ate up every last piece and had no complaints.  Happy Hour selection is pretty broad.  The prices are a bit higher than most happy hour menus, but the portions make up for it.  Other choices include Ahi Poke Stack, Domestic pints for $3.50, and Calamari.  A great place for late night eats with friends/co-workers. I'll be back for more for sure!",

    "text": "This is my second time going to Yard House. First time was in Los Angeles & second time in Las Vegas. I came here with my family (big party). We were readily seated outdoors. It wasn't hot (Vegas weather) since there were mists to keep us cool. However, when they turned it off, the water kept dripping and splashing us.  We were irritated so we placed napkins on the area the water falls to prevent from splashing us. We informed our waiter about it and he said that it's been an ongoing problem and it's still in the process of being fixed.  Dj was our waiter for the night. He was very nice in the beginning. Yard House is known for their beers on tap. I wanted to try something new. I asked Dj for a recommendation. He served me 2 tasting beers. Unfortunately, I only remember one of them, Leffe Blond. When I asked Dj what it was again, he was unsure and couldn't remember the name. I was a little confused since he was the one who recommended the beers to me but yet he forgot the name of it.  Yard house is very pricey. Luckily, we were there during happy hour. I ordered the Pastrami Sliders ($7) with Sweet Potato Fries. The sweet potato fries were delicious! It took very long for the food the come out. Once the food came out, the sweet potato fries were hotter than the sliders. The sliders were very disappointing. I was expecting much from the sliders, but it only had pastrami and cheese. The sliders were also cold!  My sister also ordered dessert (Souffle & Creme Brulee) togo. Everything was paid for already. Dj never came back to check on us to see if we received the dessert order. Instead, we had to ask one of the busboy to check on our to-go order. Keep in mind we were waiting for 30 minutes already & we ordered the dessert before we were done eating. The busboy followed up and said that they were packing the dessert. After another 20 minutes, we finally received our order from another waiter & not Dj. Dj never came back after we gave him the money.   I was very disappointed with the waiting time and the service from our waiter. It felt like our waiter didn't want anything but the payment & his tip. His service was not consistent.",

I believe there are over 160 beers on tap. A beer lovers paradise!  Bartenders that actually give a shit and servers that aren't on their phones all night, meaning they actually do their jobs, and do it well. Perfect ambiance for a quick drink and a bite, or a nice date night. Damn, now I'm hungry!",

    "text": "An evening of shopping can create quite the appetite. In a sea of restaurants big and small, we managed to stumble across a real treat. This place is nestled in Town Square between Guitar Center and Rave Movie Theatre.   Some may sleep on this gem because of its location. When you think of dining inside of a shopping area and you are not shopping, it can be a deterrent. It's no fun to push through crowds and fight for parking just for a drink or meal. Yard House sits in a class by itself and begs you to push beyond that way of thinking and here's why. Valet parking is available. There's great food choices for every palette and an extensive drink menu that's should be categorized as the winos bible.   This place is huge. But apparently, not big enough! We pushed our way through a crowd waiting for tables to the bar area. After all, why wait when you don't have to. The bar area offers the perfect view. It sots in the center of the room. It was rectangular shaped with tons of TVs and plenty of seating. Upon sitting, we were immediately greeted by Mitch. Before he could slid a coaster, I inquired about a cider on tap. To my surprise, there were at least six to choose from. Mitch did a good job of describing the makeup of each one which was very helpful. While sipping, I decided to look at the menu (while I could still see). It was huge! .... And admittedly, I am somewhat skeptical of places with tons of options. But, again, Yard House delivered. For starters, we ordered the lobster and crab dip. It was served with a sea of pita bread and chips. The dip was blended with just the right amount of cheese. Each bite was packed with lobster or crab and it was seasoned. More cheese please! I ordered the Mac n Cheese House Favorite (chicken breast and bacon filled pasta served in a mixture of cheeses). It was delicious. Too much to eat in one sitting. If you are not sharing, I would recommend the smaller portion. My compadre chose the street tacos which is served a la carte or as a meal with spicy rice and beans. Mitch pointed out they could be prepared various ways (i.e. on lettuce) and you could mix them up. We went with the pork belly taco and vegetable taco (something Rojos). Notice I said we. After reading the descriptions, we agreed it only made sense to share. Both entrees were worth seven stars easily.   I topped my evening off with a sparkling wine specialty beverage. It was infused with  Chambord which happens to be one of my favorite liqueurs.  If that wasn't enough, I also tried another cider. Shots out to Woodchuck for the Raspberry Cider. It was perfect. Just like the evening. Yard House, rock on!",

The tuna tartare stack or california roll (a stack of avacado, edamame and raw spicy tuna) are great.  Their thai chicken pizza is a great beer food item.  Chicken nachos is also good if you can handle the portion.  I used to go to Blue Martini upstairs a lot more but since they changed the menu Yardhouse just became a better choice.",

Sporting an impressive amount of beers on tap with a few rarities rotating in and out, Yard House is a beer lovers dream.  Alongside their massive beer selection is a suprisingly delicious selection of food. Ranging from Korean BBQ to Jamaican Jerk. I have never tasted a dish I did not enjoy at Yard House. My personal favorite being their (Mac + Cheese)2. Take your typical mac n cheese, replace the elbow macaroni with some campanelle pasta, throw in some chicken, bacon, truffle oil, mushrooms, and breadcrumbs, and you have the makings one of the best mac n cheese dishes I've ever had.  It can be a bit pricey at times and it is almost always busy (I've seriously never seen this place have a slow day), but good food and a great beer selection keep me coming back",

The food took a little time to come out, but honestly the place was packed so I understand.  For dinner we ordered the Mac and cheese and the applewood smoked bacon burger. Both entrees were piping hot, and delicious, which satisfied my disappointment over my last visit. Heather took great care of us, and because of her I will be back.",

I can't really comment on the menu outside of HH, but this was enough for me to give this joint 5 stars.  Over 100 beers on tap that really make it both a challenge and a goal to try each one.  During Happy Hour the place does get pretty busy, but service wasn't the least bit slow for me while I was over.  In fact, our server was constantly attentive and made sure we got all of our food and drink orders in.  I ordered a Miami Ice Martini ($6) and my friend and I shared some buffalo wings and seared ahi sashimi.  The drink was strong, the wings were bangin' (much better than the Hooters ones) and the sashimi was fresh and tasty.  Definitely a great start to an evening of drinks and fun.",

I will say that I wish the happy hour was earlier but then again they would probably be a lot more crowded so it's not too bad.  I'm really a fan of this place and this location.  I've been to the one at the linq and that is pretty cool as well, it's just a lot harder to get to and a bit farther away so this is my go to spot.

The mac & cheese is a must-order for any new comers, and the poke nachos are great for groups. If you're regularly near Townsquare, chances are you've been to Yardhouse and chances are you love it.",

Our experience this evening was one that we wish had never happened. The service was unlike ANY service we've ever experienced in all our visits to the restaurant. The service was not there, AT ALL. We had to ask someone after sitting down for five minutes to take our order, we put our drinks in, and waited for the server to come back. She never came back in our whole time dining. We flagged down another employee and put in our food to them. Once we got our food, we waited a couple minutes to be asked how it was, if we needed any Parmesan cheese or peppers for our pizza, NOTHING. No one made eye contact with us for a couple minutes until we finally asked A THIRD person behind the bar for sriracha and peppers. By the time we ate the pizza it was cold and we were ready to go. I was just about to order my second beer when I saw the same bartender who got us the sriracha swipe her finger over another persons beer to get the foam off. That's when we had to ask another server to just get us our bill. I hope management takes a look at this. Unsanitary and horrible customer service. Not like any experience we've had at yard house.",

If you enjoy real creme brule don't bother here.  The chicken nachos are more then enough for 2 people to share as an entree and the chocolate souffle was just ok.

Ordered Apple juice took awhile. Opened napkin with silver wrapped in it napkin had dried food all over one corner, silverware was sent back for clean set up. Meals were good other than my wife's Pepperoni Pizza was terrible,  like cardboard. She never complains. I'm a person who feels if your going to Bitch you better praise. I do write reviews praising great service great food. Wish it were True at the Yard House, especially for the money spent for my daughters graduation. I'm always interested in seeing if anyone ever calls about reviews 702-860-2398. Thank you for your time,",

They were also very knowledgeable about what was considered vegan and altered things to make our eating experience wonderful. The manager even came over and triple checked our order and everything. It was legit awesome. We will definitely be returning!",

Had the opportunity to visit last evening and the was over the top brand in the best possible way because of Jordyn. If you go there, do yourself a favor and sit in her section if you can,  and you will be in for a True treat. On point, ingratiating, informative, knowledgeable, and an honest pleasure to share the dining experience with. She is the absolute best, I promise you!

    "text": "So you're tired of eating on the Vegas Strip and just want to grab a sandwich and relax at a great place with reasonable prices. This is a great place that is located fairly close to the Strip.  It is very easy to get here by car or taxi too.  Yardhouse has a decent selection and it's good for meals or just snacking with their Snacks Menu. You can also choose from appetizers, Salads, Pizza, Street Tacos and their Gardein vegetarian selections. Whenever I come to a Yardhouse I like to choose from the Grilled Burgers, Sandwiches and House Favorites.    We ordered the Ruben sandwich on rye, grilled chicken with avocado and the grilled cheese with tomato bisque.  I tasted all of the sandwiches and I thought that Ruben was by far the best.  When I ordered the Ruben I asked if it came with rye bread and the waiter was not sure.  He was going to check and come back.  It took him some time but he returned and let me know they had rye bread.  A Ruben isn't a Ruben if it's not on rye bread!    When the food was brought to the table I was talking so I didn't check my sandwich and the bread was not rye.  It took me a while to flag down our waiter and he finally noticed me came over and took my sandwich and fries and replaced them very quickly.  According to the waiter, it seems that the server took the wrong sandwich to the table and mine was sitting there.  It did not seem as warm as the original sandwich they sent out but if I was going to ask for them to exchange it again then everyone would be done with their meals and I would still be eating. So I ate a not so warm sandwich but it had a nice taste to it. I think it would have been an awesome sandwich if it was fresh out of the kitchen.    The chicken and avocado sandwich was delicious.  The avocado was very fresh and the flavors went really well together.  The chicken was juicy and not overcooked.  The grilled cheese sandwich had tomato on it and it was good. The tomato bisque soup tasted fresh as well and was served at the perfect temperature.  The fries that came with the food were good with one of the orders but not with mine since they must have been sitting around a bit.   If you are a beer fanatic this is the place for you.  They have a huge selection of about 200 beers.  They rotate some beers so they don't always have all of them available. There are even beer blends, beer floats and beer cocktails. As far as mixed drinks they also have mixed drinks including martinis, cocktails and mules.  They have plenty of wine as well and even Sake.  I only gave the place three stars for serving a sandwich and fries that were not at the right temperature.  Our waiter was professional and polite.. When I'm with my sister we make each other laugh a lot and the waiter was very patient with us.    I would come back.",

    "text": "You go to Yardhouse expecting good beer, better-than-average bar food and lively atmosphere. The last dozen times I've been to Yardhouse I know what I'm getting and it never fails to deliver. You go here to catch up with friends, watch a sporting event or sip some good booze. For what it does, it does it right and I love coming here. It's usually my place to go when I have friends or relatives visiting from out of town.  For appetizers you have to try their fairly new poke nachos. It's so Yardhouse to have a traditional bar food like nachos with their own twist (what's hotter than poke right now) but I am a fan! It's probably my new favorite appetizer now. If fresh fish is not your thing, the fish and chips are pretty good. I am not a fan of fried fish but hey, it's not too shabby. If fish is not your thing at all they have their fail-proof wings. Tastes like the type of wings you can expect from any urban bar eatery-greasy, spicy and all deliciousness. For entrees, their steaks and ribs are pretty good. It isn't steakhouse quality so it wouldn't be my first choice. In fact I'll probably order more appetizers the next time around. I feel like Yardhouse shines in their appetizers menu and they are more of a tapas bar to me with beer. Oh the beer, they have a wide selection of beer-local, domestic, international, you name it. My personal favorite right now is the Moose Drool.  All in all, this is a solid choice to catch a game, have a good time with friends or relatives. You really can't go wrong. Show up early because the place is always packed!",

We met with a couple of our friends for drinks and dinner on a Friday. We were quoted 25-30 minutes, and were seated in 20. They were pumping people in and out of there quickly and turnover was efficient to say the least.   Service is always excellent. Our server this time around was the perfect blend of attentive without being annoying. Despite being incredibly busy, we couldn't tell because he never skipped a beat, never made us wait long for anything, and never seem rushed/hurried/dismissive.   Food is surprisingly good here. The exception being the calamari was rubbery and definitely overdone, and the two dips were rather bland (one was a marinara and one was some sort of jalapeno something or other). I have had ALL of their pasta dishes, and for a place you would expect to only have \"bar food\" the pastas are DELICIOUS! They are willing to substitute different types of pasta in each dish if you want (I subbed the penne for angel hair). Food prices are $1-2 too high in my opinion.   Drinks: One of the reasons I like this place so much is the beer selection is MASSIVE. I have never had the same beer twice. Only like ciders? Well they have several to choose from of those as well. Beer flights here are also a great idea and affordable.   Definitely will be back! Especially as it warms up to sit on the patio.",

She was really on top of things even though I'm a horrible person and can't remember her name yo give her credit.   But soda was always filled, checked up on us often but not overbearing, gave us a bag and containers to take out leftovers home without us asking and just had an awesome attitude.    We went during happy hour and go a disgusting amount of food.    Onion rings- we liked them and they give a hefty portion.  Would only get again if I was sharing with a few people ($5)  Traditional wings- really enjoyed them.  Gave us 10 medium sized wings.  Would definitely get them again ($6)  Fried Calamari- not good IMO.   Texture of the squid was a bit too squishy/tough and not feeling the breading.   Should have known not to get the seafood.  ($7)  Blue Crab Cakes- you get 2 decent sized per order.   They were decent but not intending to get again.   I'll pass, and for the money you can do better here.   ($7)  BBQ chicken pizza- better than what they serve at California Pizza Kitchen.  Nice sized.  You can share with 3 people easily as part of your order and won't get sick of it.   For the money, it was well sized and tasty.  ($7)  Overall would go back during happy hour but know to avoid the crab cakes and calamari.  Gonna be on the wings and pizza like white on rice.",

In my case Marcoes was my waiter bartender.... His first recommendation was a New Holland Dragon Milk Stout from New Holland Michigan a wonderful tasting beer. we talk story for a little while and about the food and I ordered  a poke nacho style appetizer.... Poke (tuna) with avocado and cilantro, serrano peppers, green onion, thin dried Nori and homemade crispy wontons... The wontons were amazing thin and Light. They made a sauce similar to a Korean sauce that covered the dish.... This dish was amazing is incredible the different flavors everything was perfect. The noodles were very light not what you expect from wonton.  So incredible choices of draft beers and  after a while I had a second appetizer that he recommended the grilled Korean BBQ Beef kalbi over rice and spinach it's pretty ono... I saw many local families with kids enjoying meals and I also saw groups of friends and couples so just a nice place with relatively easy parking available and good food plus a variety of little shops around to walk off the meal afterwards as long as you don't go into the many sweet shops.",

During happy hour most appetizers and pizzas are half-priced so it's always great to share a couple with some friends. They also have a great salad, sandwich or soup combo during lunch for a quick bite. Oh and they probably have the best Moscow mules you can find in Vegas!

Looked good, HUGE!  I was disliked the nachos, the chicken looked as if they boiled it.  It had no flavor, no color.  Yeah, I have had way better nachos then this!  The waiter was great, but it wasn't his problem.",

I door and outdoor seating available.  The best part are all of the VEGAN options on the menu marked with a green  V. I love the spicy Edaname. There are HUGE portions so go hungry.   As for the signiture cocktails, they have a great balance selection of sweet, bitter and just strong. The bar is best known for their huge assortment of on tap drafts, a specialty for them!  Service is really on point, and what makes me go back. I have never had a single issue in all the years I have gone here for various occasions. That consistancy is one of the best parts of this awesome local spot!",

    "text": "Finally reviewing my favorite chain restaurant! Read below for reasons why it's my favorite..  The service is always near perfect. The hostesses are super friendly and always smiling. The waiters and waitresses are prompt with orders, refill your liquid very regularly, and when sitting at the bar, the drinks are poured strong and fast. The bartenders are even great at fake laughing to my horrible puns and observations..   The atmosphere is amazing here. They have huge, comfortable booths, outdoor seating with heaters/mist-ers, and normal bar/table seating. Plus people watching is great if you're single. So many hot/pretty girls and good looking dudes to look at and flirt with (well, for me, the girls). Haha. It's a very hip, modern, FUN place whether you're 21 or 51. Not recommended for he families with kids, though..  The food is the reason I keep coming back. The Ahi Tuna nachos, cheese curds, Tuna Poki Stack, Beranaise burger sliders, salads, soup, and basically everything here is awesome tasting. My only gripe is they switched their awesome shoe-string fries to average, unoriginal typical fries.   Pro tip: Get the Coconut battered deep fried cheese curds. Holy crap, they're great!",

What I really enjoy about YH is the consistency in the establishment other than the host staff it's a great experience.   Beers are always on point with a great selection although they could put some more thought into them and use some local Vegas breweries versus the mainstream and it would add more local flair to the place.   Food is always decent but never great at least you know what you're getting when you go here. I had ordered truffle fries (no truffle oil flavor rather tasted like old dirty fryer oil) and a chicken and avocado sandwich (menu nor the waitress lacked to inform me that it was a bland puree of avocado. I would have preferred just sliced if avocado and called it a day) which lacked any integrity in making such a simple sandwich.  Needless to say I don't goto YH to be wowed by the food but at least try a little bit harder to have a decent pallet.  Service was great and the waitress was on top of her tables. She was super friendly and really open to any suggestions and answered all our questions to the best of her knowledge.",

Beer:  they have house brew beers, just tell your waiter about you preference, you will get some good suggestions.  Food:  Guacamole and chips: taste super good, guacamole taste so fresh, I cleaned up the bowl with my chip.  Spinach and cheese dip: the cheese is real deal, great amount of cheese that can give you extra cheesy taste. The homemade chips are amazing!!! Extra thick type of chips.  Kale Caesars with steak: amazing dish, I chose median for the steak, they cooked it perfectly. It contained different texture cause they added some nuts and dry fruits.  Service & environment: the servers were really nice and polite, my friend had allergic to coconut, they gave her lots of carrots and celery to ate with spinach and cheese.   The prices were little bit high but reasonable, the services and food they provided definitely worth the price!",

I've definitely had my ups and downs with the chain but my experience is more so on the positive side for this location.  For the most part, the food is pretty good. Majority of the menu (food wise) seems to be reasonably priced and you get what you pay for. I like how they have a slight variety in their menu but still isn't too large of a selection.   What I ordered was the black truffle burger and chicken nachos. The chicken nachos were delicious! They're served hot on a large plate, have a lot of chicken chunks, and give you both guacamole and sour cream. It's definitely worth ordering for yourself or for the table. The black truffle cheese burger was very flavorful upon first bite. The toppings were placed sloppily and I had to scoop them up from the plate, but it was good! All burgers come with fries (truffle fries for an extra dollar).  The service I received was truly exceptional. I was able to sit exactly where I wanted, and change the channels for multiple televisions so everyone at the table could watch comfortably. The waiter we had was very attentive and was quick to ask if I needed anything. My burger wasn't cooked the way I asked but it wasn't that big a deal for me this time. The waiter didn't wait for a complaint; he asked me if it was what I asked for and didn't hesitate to offer a correction. I appreciated his hard work throughout the night and it made my experience that much better.  I'd be willing to comeback to try and overwrite any negative experiences I've previously had.",

Samantha was our first bartender. She had given us a second to look at the menu, and when she came back, my boyfriend had ordered a drink while I just ordered water because I didn't know what I wanted yet. She never brought out a water. I wasn't a fan of the spicy mustard sauce for the pretzel. Way too strong. Also, would have liked to seen a simple cheese dip, a fan favorite you can't go wrong with. Hofbrauhaus still has the best sauces. Sliders had a great savory flavor! When it came to refill one of our beers, she had brought out the wrong one. She quickly realized and apologized, in turn brought out the right one. Desiree [might have spelt it wrong] was our second bartender. She was very sweet and easy to talk to. I asked her for a water and she promptly brought one over. When it came to our second course of apps, we had to wait a little to receive silverware/plates. It could have been lack of awareness or lack of communication from the first bartender, for instance if Desiree wasn't aware we had more food coming since she did clear our first set of plates. On our way out, all the hostesses acknowledged us leaving and said goodbye.",

    "text": "On the table lay the following entrees: ahi sashimi, deviled eggs, traditional wings, and  fish n chips with truffle fries. Different chains of the food group... what a great mix of texture, flavor and taste. It was a sword fight of tangy, salty, and spice! Wash it down with some hefeweizen and it completes the taste experience!   Let's not forget dessert! I indulged in the mini trio sampler comprised of lemon soufflet,  peach apple cobbler, and chocolate soufflet. The benefits of sugar is the rush of taste and the adrenaline that comes with it. I received my second wind after the \"ittis\" and as Tony, Toni, Tone sang \"It feels good!\"   Experience makes great memories when it is satiated with the good company you keep. Thank you to my dear friend for treating me to this fine meal.",

First off, the wait time is well handled. We only had ten minutes to be seated and that was on a Saturday night. Next, our server, Marshal A., was charming, accommodating, and super knowledgeable about the menu. Our food was timed perfectly and he anticipated our needs like a seasoned veteran.  The food was very good, but seemed to lack a little depth. I had the miso sea bass. Usually the sauce has more depth. I'm not holding it against them though and will order this yumminess again. VGK had just lost and everyone was a little effected. My husband had the fried chicken and adored it.  My daughter would like the gruyere back on the grilled cheese and tomato soup item. Blue cheese just doesn't rank and that item was why we chose Yardhouse in the first place. Overall, a good memory in a reliable and yummy place.",

Their fries are absolutely delicious! The BBQ sauce on the burger is very sweet. I think the waiter said it is maple BBQ sauce.   The food was pretty good but the restaurant is kinda loud.

On  Friday I showed just before 5 pm, during happy hour, and the place was packed - not even an empty seat at the bar to have a beer while waiting for a table. I had to wait 25 minutes for a table. Once seated, the service was very friendly but slow and not too attentive. My Korean tacos were satisfactory but otherwise unimpressive.   On Saturday I showed for lunch about 11:45. Plenty of available seating and once seated the service was fast, friendly, and attentive. My beer this time was the Belgium sampler. Again the house Belgium was the best of the bunch. Lunch was lamb burger and fries. Much better than the Korean tacos the night before.   Popular place for sure. Fun atmosphere, excellent selection of beers, but only average service and food. Still, the beer alone justifies a return trip.",

Being someone who loves rice this bothers me. I really enjoy soft rice with my dishes. It does add a texture and it does prevent the dish from getting soggy but there needs to be a happy medium. The bok choy was cooked well and is roasted. these were so delicious. I have to admit the miso sauce on the rice was pretty salty. It complimented the lightness of bass.  I also had a taste of the pan seared ahi tuna. this was an interesting one. The ahi was cooked to perfection but the bean sauce was exxxxxtremely salty. Unfortunately the individual I was with came to the same conclusion. I have to say that the fish was cooked to perfection and was fresh.  Environment was extremely loud and packed. Personally not my cup of tea. For the food it was worth it though.",

For drink refills, I was practically choking on my food before she came by to give me watered down ginger ale. Waitress kept trying to give our food to another table, and even when standing next to her, our whole table telling her to put the food down, she still moved to put it on the other side of our table. Only after she put it down and three of our group picked up the plate to move it did she grab it and put it where we initially wanted it to go. The food is WAY to salty. I may as well lick a salt rock.  The calamari was great. It was tender and not overly fried. Excellent flavor.  The dessert I had was the peach apple cobbler. The mini creme brulee was bigger than the three spoonfuls of pie and hunk of ice cream. The crust was crunchy and the ice cream was dripping a little more than I cared for by the time it got to me. The tart fruit slices were met with an insane amount of sweetness at the bottom. The ice cream's taste was nice, but I'm not sure where in the dish the caramel came from.  It was more appetizing than the steak.  Bring a jacket. No matter where you sit, once they open the door, everyone is freezing cold.",

Our server brought me samples of the different types of cider which is awesome because I got to pick which one I like. I'm usually very picky with ciders because of the artificial tastes but when he gave me samples, I got to pick which one I like better.

Beer - The selection of beer on draft is amazing.  Who knew about a yard glass of draft could be what the doctor ordered.  Not the cheapest beer, and a bit slow to make its way to your table.  However, very nice selection.  2. Food - A very large menu.  Plenty of Vegetarian dishes, Gardien substitute dishes as well as your Hamburgers, Pastas, Meats/ Fish, Pizzas and plenty of other items.   3.  Service - Great service, attentive and friendly.  4.  Music - Kind of loud atmosphere.  A little too loud to have great conversations, however,  you can cuddle up tighter if need be!  5.  Waiting time - Takes a bit of the food and lots of time for the alcohol to come out and served.  Also, why not serve the food together rather than waiting 10 minutes for food to dribble out and then some getting cold?  6.  The price - Very pricey this place is.

    "text": "Had lunch today with my friends and I've been here couple of times and only good things I have to say at this location of Yardhouse.   Lets just say the food was awesome!!!! I ordered Cobb salad sans avocado with grilled chicken, and my friends had Gardein vegan burger and Mac&Cheese along with mimosas. The mimosas were a little too strong for me but I like it anyway. For desert we had mini chocolate souffle cake & mini creme brulee.   Our waiter was SUPER awesome! She was very attentive and super nice! And so does the food servers! Because we requested outside seating, we were told it's a 15 minutes wait. But honestly we probably wait like 5 minutes or so and we were seated outside. It was super hot today and unfortunately we were seated under a heating thing. So we asked to move to the next table because 70 weather and heater over your head, I didn't wanted to be an oven roasted turkey. There was a slight delay with our food. I think it's because of the lunch time and today being a Saturday. We ordered couple of dishes to go and surprisingly our to go orders came first. But anyway we had such a fun time and the food was amazing to go with a good date with your friends.",

If your looking for a place to have a beer and watch a sporting event on their many tv's - sit at the bar and enjoy.",

We had the macaroni and cheese with gardein chicken with truffle sauce so yummy! My favorite!   Our only disappointment was that my bf's burger didn't have a bearnaise sauce.  And on the menu it says Bernaise burger. It was just a reg burger he got. He was hungry so he just ate it. We didn't even tell our waiter.",

After thinking it over for about a week, we decided to go to the Yard House at Town Center.  Now, I have been to a couple of Yard Houses in So. Cal. and I liked the idea.  So, I called and made a reservation for the 10 of us.  Here is my experience:  Like I stated before, I called to make a reservation.  And, I talked to Bo, one of the managers.  He was extremely helpful as I told him my needs.  Which were, a table to fit all of us and a T.V. to watch the game.  He hooked us up and explained up front that there was to be an 18% automatic gratuity added to our bill.  Which is policy for groups over 7.  We were fine with that as I'm sure we tipped out more.  Our waiter and waitress were awesome.. they were friendly, attentive and speedy.  I should have gotten their names but, I forgot.  They truly made the night.    I saw food and drinks come out and everything looked good.  I don't think that anyone had any problems.  I can only comment on the Pizza and beer that I ordered.  I was really happy with my order.  I can't complain at all.  So, I give Yard House 5 stars because we all had a great night with great service, great drinks, great food and even better company.  Side note: The Angels won! and that was just the icing on the cake.",

Some of the food we ordered: Fried calamari: it's pretty good, it was crispy and breaded well.  Crab cake: it's okay, i don't really like the sauce they put. It was too sweet.  Spicy tuna: it was good portion of food. It was a little spicy but enough to be content,  and it has a little vegetable. It was good!  Strawberry Field martini: it's sweet and vodka is a strong but it was the bomb! Southern belle: it was so good!  Southern punch: it's amazing!   Overall, the happy hour here is excellent.

I knew today I'd be enjoying a great meal with the service we received at this location! First off, Jesse(the host) was sooo very kind and respectful. As soon as I walked in the door he had a smile on his face,stopped his conversation and greeted me. The table he was told to put me at wasn't ideal for me..sorry but I'm short and I don't want to see at a lower booth. So with out hesitation he placed me in a better spot. As soon as I sat down, our server ...Zach.. I believe was there to get myself and my guest waters while I waited for her. Once she arrived he gave us just enough time to look over the menu so that we could enjoy the happy hour!  He helped me remember a dish that is now \"off the menu\" and made sure that it was exactly what I was talking about. Garlic chicken noodles .... try it.. it's amazing. Food tastes amazing. His humor and personality through our whole stay was nothing but amazing and we appreciated it! Yardhouse isn't usually the first place I think of to go to but my experience today has definitely put them right there in my top 3!",

I just don't understand why you would promote vegetarian or vegan when you would cook these vegetarian foods along with equipment you cook animal flesh on. I will be contacting peta to take them off the list for vegan friendly restaurants. This is absolutely disgusting. They even use the name GARDEIN on their menu and GARDEIN is a brand that is completely vegan but because this company refuses to accommodate vegans non of their stuff is vegan except for one item because they have to cross contaminate the food with animal flesh. I will also be contacting GARDEIN because this is unacceptable. Why would you use a completely vegan product and not live up to their standard.",

    "text": "This place is good, however overrated. Very expensive if it's not happy hour, Crowded and quite slow service, it's good food and you probably won't be disappointed but there are a lot of places for the same price where you will have a larger selection of food and a more relaxing experience... If your at town square try Brios, if your at red rock hotel try Lucilles smokehouse. The yard house needs to lower their prices , they think they are the only good food joint in town. They better be careful, this is Las Vegas not Grand Rapids, MI... There is serious competition here, I predict the redrock Yardhouse will start to lose biz because of the new Lucille's , Only thing that will save them is to offer More specials.   Another thing is their bartenders are typical Punks, and me as a local do not feel welcome there, I feel like just another touristic foreigner. I won't go back, This place is for tourists whom don't care  About the cost  Goto Lucille's, amazing all around, stop supporting overpriced mediocre restaurants like the Yardhouse",

    "text": "Lets preface how I even ended up here:   I was having a bad week (I got sick with a stomach virus, sick boyfriend, dog got sick from ingesting cat litter pellets, water heater broke, fought with my mom on her birthday call, neighbors stole my trashcans, my iPhone broke) so the Yelperazzi got together to try to turn things around. It's a real Yelp success story....We came as strangers and discovered friends. I mean I adore a lot of people on Yelp, but I'm particularly lucky to have met Jieun L, Anthony M., Elnino F, and Andy T who cared  enough to get me out of the house and get me out of my birthday funk.  My BF reads my reviews and he also turned everything around with the small things. Thank you guys and I love you all.   Beers are here so I have a hard time not liking this chain...with the circumstance above though I was in that kind of mood to almost hate everything because I'm reserved to being \"done with\" today. It's extra kudos to the Yardhouse reliable brews, decent food and our server that I still enjoyed the restaurant. Yeah there are setbacks like any spots but drink selections make me happy so it was a good choice to turn around any bad day. Our server (Mitch) was pretty good in service, had good beer recommendations and he also brought me a happy birthday brownie sundae (yay!). Nachos were pretty good and loaded with stuff. Sweet potato fries maple bacon sauce was delish that I want to pour that on just about every breakfast item. Ceviche spoons were fresh and light. Chicken garlic noodles- good but go for the plain garlic noodles. There was chicken, tofu, mushrooms, edamame, asparagus, chives, garlic, cheese and it's too much at once. Simple is better with garlic noodles.  BF found a favorite beer worth mentioning- Rogue Dry Hopped Red. Smooth with a bit of hops...a good choice to baby step into the IPAs and DIPAs. He liked it much so that we went back 4days later to order this beer again...we never order twice since our goal is to drink down the whole list (past halfway).   A few drinks and plates in we were laughing so hard that I was snorting. I mean, I like never do that unless I'm really fighting hard to stop laughing. Anthony has awesome one liners. Jieun makes funny beer faces. Elnino is a violent funny drunk. My BF coined some T-shirt worthy terms at the table. Andy is just a G and always for a good time.   I expected to go home from work, eat lunch and stay home alone until my BF can get off, head to dinner and go sleep and forget about the day even being my birthday.   Everything is alright when you have good company to make you smile.",

For happy hour all craft beers are $4-4.50 which is great for a lot of the obscure and hard to find beers on the menu.

That's the first time I've ever gone out to celebrate a birthday and they did absolutely nothing but a snide remark. This was a family affair. The waiter was insensitive. We probably should have called a manager. I've been writing for TripSheet Magazine for 15 years and will let the know in my dining and entertainment column. Some 12,000 cab and limo drivers will know not to take birthday parties to The Yard House. My wife was in charge of organizing and both my wife and daughter reminded the waiter. He still got a good tip. We are loyal customers of this establishment. They sent me a $25 gift certificate so my wife and I came back for a late night dinner. I was between the full rack of BBQ ribs and the rib eye steak and the waiter try the steak. It was juicy and delicious. It came with broccolini with too much salt, mashed potatoes and I guess they forget the creamed corn. My wife had the turkey burger which was good. This place was packed on a Thursday night.",

    "text": "The Yardhouse is a nice place to go if you're tired of the same old brews on tap. They have a fantastic and interesting selection of beers available, even if their staff sometimes can't offer much help! In their defense, though, the beer list is quite lengthy.  This particular location has a pretty nice patio with a fire pit outside that makes for some great people watching. I find that every Yardhouse I've been to is always incredibly loud. Maybe it's the cement floors that just ricochet the sound throughout the restaurant, but it makes for the main reason I stay away from these restaurants until a friend drags me along for happy hour.  The food is decent and I'll give them props for having a wide variety of tastes that goes well beyond your typical bar food. Unfortunately, everything is only decent. People rave about the truffle fries, but for me personally, I've never been into the white truffle oil thing and think it tastes like gasoline - fresh truffles are another matter entirely.  The ahi tuna poke bowl is fresh and my favorite thing to order here- light soy sauce, rich avocado, a little bit of crunch and sesame oil.. great success.  The ahi tuna burgers on the other hand- which claim to be fresh ahi tuna that is hand chopped - automatically comes cooked well. Who.. in their right mind.. cooks fresh ahi tuna well?! It's madness I tell you, and made those burgers that were once great, completely below par. If you decide to go this route - make sure you specify how you want them done! The deviled eggs were a little sweet, but definitely a fun and unusual choice for a restaurant. Ahi tuna caesar salad- exactly what you'd expect. French onion soup - decent, but nothing to rave about. A small bowl with provolone melted over the top, a little lighter broth than most places, the bread was okay. Just okay.  Overall, a good happy hour with something for everyone - even a fire pit!",

The crab cakes were \"o-k\" and the pizzas were what I expected.. but wow those lettuce wraps. I highly recommend them. They have beer \"tasting\" flights, which 2 of our friends ended up ordering. If you are a beer drinker, this place is heaven! I didn't care much for my martini but I think it just wasn't for my taste.

It's a must. The best/worst part about it is when you get towards the bottom of your beer the glass acts more like a beer bong. The liquid just shoots down your throat. I guess it makes the experience more fun.   The food was good. We just got a bunch of appetizers.   Sliders: Theses were okay, not out standing.  Asian glazed chicken wings: YUMMIE! They were my favorite but a bit spicy.  coconut shrimp: You get like two shrimps.. okay maybe three and they weren't that good.  Mac and Cheese: Yummie! I liked it but I couldn't really taste any truffle oil.  Pear and walnut salad: I liked this dish a lot. Almost finished all of it myself. Chicken Lettuce wraps: Ehhh... like any other wrap.   All in all go for the beer. I'm sure they'll have your favorite!",

Yard House was the answer.   The whole experience was wonderful starting from Amy, the hostess (she was very bubbly and genuinely cared about how my day was going) to Tracy, our server. She quickly brought out a Mac N' Cheese 2 for the kids (such a blessing to get quick food for little ones). We tried a bunch of different plates...like the ahi tuna poke bowl, spicy tuna roll, deviled eggs (which I didn't have...wasn't feeling it today), truffle fries, a burger with no bun, a steak sandwich with sweet potato fries drizzled with some honey sauce that made me want to scream with delight.

And if you still aren't convinced, imagine big delicious portions and an amazingly generous happy hour menu. Two friends and I recently enjoyed a late evening dining experience: Chicken Nachos, Margherita Pizza, Bernaise Sliders, Tomato Bisque, 2 beers and a martini = under $50 with tip.   Great atmosphere and plenty of TVs for those who want less conversation and more game time. When the weather is nice, grab a seat outdoors and enjoy some people watching. Even when the weather isn't so nice (just for a few short months in Las Vegas) there are conveniently located outdoor heaters, as in they are out of your way and you won't burn yourself after stumbling out because you sampled all 150 beers.  To my not-so-crazy-about-beer-people: take it from someone who doesn't care for beer. Do you like juice? Carbonation perhaps? I highly recommend giving the Lidemans Framboise or Strawberry Fruli a try. I promise you won't even notice its beer. If that doesn't work out Yardhouse has a great selection of mixed drinks and martinis. Try the Gobbstopper Martini or the Black Orchid Martini.   And remember people: always drink responsibly :)",

I explained to him what I ordered and what was in front of me where two completely different things. Now I've eaten this exact meal before, at this same location. I know what I'm expecting.

And LOUD, but in a good way. The music is fun. Their menu for both food and drinks is HUGE!! you could spend an hour just trying to figure out what you want. I always start with the Hot and Spicy Edamame! It is a must try!  They're also open late. I believe they close at 1am. I would recommend getting there around midnight just in case they take a last seating.",

Favorite dish hands down would be the Spicy Jambalaya w/ linguini! (Not on HH)  For dessert you can't go wrong with either the mini creme brulee or the berry rum macadamia nut crumble.",

    "text": "How have I not reviewed Yard House yet?! It's been a while since I've eaten here (usually we just come for beer) so we decided to stop by yesterday for happy hour, which is Mon thru Fri 3 to 6 PM. Happy hour features half priced appetizers, $2 off glasses of wine, and $4-5 beer. Since I never know what kind of beer to get, I looked at the menu until something sounded good...Ok, I'll have a Spaten Oktoberfest...isn't this beer only seasonal though?   We ordered some appetizers to share: onion ring tower, spicy tuna roll, bernaise sliders w/ fries, and chicken lettuce wraps. Our favorite were the lettuce wraps, where the chicken was perfectly cooked and the sauces provided went well with it, especially the sweet and sour that had a little kick to it. The onion rings were a little over cooked and brown/over crispy but were still ok, especially when dipped in ranch. The sliders are always delicious, topped with fried onion strings and 1 of my favorite items on their menu. I didn't have the spicy tuna roll since I don't eat fish so I can't comment on that dish.  Yard House is one of my favorite places to grab a drink or hang with friends, especially this one since it's located right in Town Square and near the movie theater, making it a good place to drink before catching a movie. They also have a large number of TVs, so it's a good place to catch a game although I'm never on this side of town on football Sundays...They also have plenty of patio seating which is perfect on those spring and summer nights",

I enjoyed the dark and modern theme this place has, along with the simple outdoor dining area as well. The poke nachos are a unique twist and were my favorite. Along with the macaroni, it had a bunch of different and unique tastes and textures that I haven't had before in macaroni and cheese. Yard house would be the place to go for a nice dinner with a group of friends. Right across or at least a little farther down is game works, amc movie theatre, or the grass area. This was placed at a good side of townsquare n everyone needs to try out this place at least once in their life!",

The first few times I went I ordered their Chicken Caesar Salad, Chicken Rice Bowl, and an Ahi Tuna dish. The salad is veryyyy tastey so I kept ordering that the other times. The third time I came here I was ordering vodka martinis and they were made perfectly. So funny story, I started noticing that on the third drink, the bartender had given me three olives so I was like lol.... Then the fourth one he gave me four olives so I was really laughing at this point because the drink looked ridiculous. I asked the waiter what the hell the bartender was up to and at first he thought I was complaining but it turned into a big laughing session. Thank you for making mine and my date's night Mr. Mysterious Bartender. Highly recommend this place!",

She kept our glasses full of water and made sure we always had a beer available if we wanted one. We munched on truffle fries while we waited and they were the perfect mix of warm, salty and a bit of a crunch. Our entrees were also excellent: my husband ordered the Nashville Hot House Chicken and I had a chicken stir fry which was light and so flavorful. I wasn't expecting that from them!  Then we returned, this time during happy hour, and we're strongly encouraged to order from that menu. I wish we hadn't. The quality of the food just wasn't the same. Everything tasted like reheated frozen appetizers, from our egg rolls to the nachos (which the chicken on it was dry and overcooked). My husband liked his wings and onion rings though. Next time, I'll just stick to an entree, regardless of how cheap their appetizers or small plates are during happy hour.",

    "text": "I won't lie. I had the lowest expectations of Yard House after having been to so many lackluster ones. Luckily for Vegas, this one is a winner, winner. Now all I'm missing is a chicken dinner.  But there's a lot more to be had. Like all Yard House menus, the variety spans from Americana to Asian in one giant menu. It's like Cheesecake Factory, but pricier and vastly higher quality. If there is a place to enjoy a killer selection of beer, while ordering everything from Hawaiian Poke to Korean Kalbi to Shrimp Ceviche, let it be here.  As a venue, this Yard House is stacked. A robust wait staff, plenty of seating all around, with TVs lining the ceilings and corners and game audio for a crowded Monday Night Football viewing. Who ever said this side of Vegas (Town Square) was boring? Certainly not I.  My hungry and tired of group of frenzy eaters ordered a plethora of random stuff, just as their menu intended:  Chicken Lettuce Wraps ($12) Kung Pao Calamari ($11) Seared Ahi Sashimi ($14) Boneless Wings ($13) Hawaiian Poke Stack ($14) Turkey Club ($11) Spicy Tuna Roll ($13)  All in all, everything was decent. The chicken lettuce wraps were fresh, tasty, and abundant. Wasn't the biggest fan of the kung pao calamari, but folks looking for a different take on fried squid ought to try it once. While the turkey club, boneless wings, and spicy tuna roll (which looked like mofongo!) were somewhere in the middle, the seared ahi and poke stack were the surprising winners of the night. Extra surprising that it tasted like fresh fish all while in the middle of the desert? Most definitely.  While I'm not one to frequent chains, I can see myself coming back to this Yard House with beer loving, sports seeking, hungry, good company. Lastly, it's a solid spot that is  within 2 minutes away from McCarran International Airport.",

I do have to say you have a few options there. I believe there are 3-4 each of soup and salads to choose from. I chose classic Caesar and clam chowder. Both were awesome!!!   Everyone ordered something different. I saw fish, sandwiches, meatless chicken wings, meatless salads, Asian, tacos, all sorts of stuff. Everyone enjoyed their meals.

    "text": "This is a standard restaurant for us. A staple in our rotation. A \"it's convenient\", \"it's reasonably priced\", \"the happy hour is good\", \"I'm not craving anything in particular\", \"let's just do something easy and casual\" restaurant.  It's a good place. It's just not a great place. Everything is pretty solid. But nothing is exceptional.  The bartenders are very nice and helpful. They will give you a free sample taste of any of the draft beers. And it's a decent list of beers.  The service has always been good. Even when it is crowded and very busy, we've never had any issues with the service here.  One of my favorite go-to items on the menu is the bernaise sliders. The sliders themselves are very good. Good burgers and good buns. The bernaise sauce comes on the side. It is definitely not your standard bernaise sauce and would never hold up on a steak. But on a burger, this particular bernaise is delicious. The shoestring fries that come on the side are also great. Just the right amount of crispiness and salt.  The pizzas have also always been pretty good. Along with most of their menu items.  The wings, though, have been somewhat of a let-down. They are your typical cheap tavern wings, except they aren't cheap. Poor quality meat and not that meaty. The firecracker wings have a great sauce. Very saucy and flavorful. The buffalo wings, though, while there is a decent flavor to the sauce, is a very oily sauce. The ranch dipping sauce is well above average and pairs nicely with the wings.  The atmosphere is ok. The space and decor works. It's definitely a family-friendly place, often filled with strollers and small children. The bar area can be quite full during happy hour. Seems to be popular with both tourists and locals alike.  If you are expecting culinary greatness, you will be disappointed. If you are looking for a decent lunch or dinner after a couple of hours of shopping or before hitting a movie, this place will hit the spot. And the happy hour deals are great.",

Both the beer and food selection is great. I always find myself trying out a new beer and appetizer/entree every time I drop a visit. And for a franchised restaurant? It's pretty darn good. Their take on classic bar food exceeds expectations with a touch of quality for the price that you're paying.  The ambiance is great too. The energy's always there making it effortless to have a great time regardless of what the occasion might be. Everyone's in a great mood eating good food drinking good booze while socializing like there's no tomorrow.  Knocked off a star since the times I do grab a table, I realized that I would much rather sit at the bar after receiving slow service- but I do understand how chaotic this place could get. Aside from that, I still love you Yard House. Always and forever.",

    "text": "Friday night was alright! Went with our friend from out of town because of the famous over easy egg on a burger! We did have to wait 30 minutes on a Friday around 8pm, not bad since it was packed-at least they knew what they were doing getting it moving. We sat outside since it was a nice night. We ordered the bearnaise burger (bearnaise sauce, fried onions) with garlic fries, the pastrami benedict burger (roasted tomatoes, fried onions, swiss, bearnaise sauce, fried egg) with onion rings and the kids chicken teriyaki with fries. The bearnaise burger was ok nothing special and a little drying( bland and I wouldn't recommend ) The pastrami burger was really good but a mess to actually eat- my man lived it though and will be getting it again. Our son also loved the chicken and fries, his also came with a drink and a rice crispy treat at the end in cookies and cream. He loved it and for only $7 seemed like a great deal! The waitress however was a nightmare, she didn't seem like she wanted to be there and was annoyed after every question I asked. Maybe she had a long day but I felt like I was bothering her. Ps they also charge $1 extra for garlic fries which was a regret since there was soooo much onion in it, and for a $1 total scam! The onions rings were a dollar more too but very good, I'd pay $1 more again.",

    "text": "***Disclaimer - REALLY long review in regards to late night Happy Hour not being honored on St. Patrick's Day  Came to Yard House at Town Square to celebrate my birthday with my husband and I was very excited to order quite a bit of things on the menu, both food and drink.  However, I was VERY disappointed to find out that happy hour was not being honored.  My birthday is on St Patricks Day and the server informed me that there was no happy hour because it was a holiday.  I informed the server that it's not a national holiday and there happy hour policy on their menu does not state that holidays are not included.  We were not informed when we entered the restaurant that there was no happy hour.  We were also not informed when we were seated and our first orders were taken that there was no happy hour.  If my husband had not inquired if a certain beer was on the happy hour menu, I believe we would not have been informed that happy hour was not being honored.    My evening was ruined because there was no happy hour.  I did not want to order as many items as I would have liked because there was no happy hour.  My husband did not want to cause a scene that evening so I did not ask for a manager that night.    The food that we did order was good for the most part, but it wasn't great.  We ordered the spicy tuna and california roll.  The spicy tuna was good but the california roll's rice was hard and undercooked.  The hummus lacked flavor.  The only really good thing I ate was the jamaican jerk wings.    The next day I called other Yard House's in Las Vegas and the one at Red Rock informed me that they honor happy hour on holidays, it just depended on which holiday.  They said it was at the manager's discretion.  They said that they had happy hour but only from 3 p.m. - 6 p.m. and not the late night happy hour.  I also called Blue Martini, McFaddens, and Buffalo Wild Wings who said they had happy hour on St. Patricks Day.    I then called the Yard House at Town Square and asked to speak to a manager.  I spoke to Leo and he informed me that the policy for no happy hour came from corporate.  He informed me that customers were being informed at the door that there was no happy hour and I informed him that was not the case with us.  He explained there was nothing he could do for me because corporate sent that policy.  He informed me that no Yard House in the country had late night happy hour on St. Patrick's Day.  I asked him for the number to corporate and thanked the manager for his time.    I then called four other Yard Houses in the country and three out of the four said they had happy hour both early and late, even though it was St. Patrick's Day.  I contacted corporate and left a message since it was after hours.  I waited 2 days but heard nothing back.  I called corporate again on Friday, March 21 and spoke to customer service who researched the information for me.  He was first unaware of the policy so he said he would contact the Yard House in Town Square and give me a call back.  After calling back he informed me that there may have been some miscommunication and that he was new and that is why he may not have heard of the happy hour policy for St. Patrick's Day.  He asked if the manager at Yard House did anything for me and I informed him that he did not.  In the end, he said he would do more research and send me some gift certificates in the mail.    As of 3/28/14.  I have not received them but he did say they would take approximately 7-10 business days.  All in all, I was just very disappointed with the way they went about the happy hour policy.  They should have made a sign out front or placed a note on the menu, or trained ALL STAFF to inform EVERYONE before they were seated.",

We waited and sat outside. We have our kids and it was a beautiful night so we figured why not? It is also fairly loud inside, so outside was best for the kids. The tables inside and out are extremely close together and I felt like the ladies sitting next to our table should have just joined us because we heard everything they said (or they could have just been being really loud, but we were very close). The service was only okay we had to practically grab our server's arm just to get refills. The food was pretty good, but the selection of items were not fantastic. Not to mention I felt the pricing was much more than similar restaurants. While the food was good we probably won't be back because there are other places just as good with much better pricing.",

    "text": "This place is good for BIG parties and I mean 20+ people. We had my bf's and his friend's birthday dinner few weeks ago and had so much fun. The servers were very friendly and accommodating. Everyone ordered the yardstick($13 for 2 glasses of beer) while I drank my water since I wasn't in the mood to drink. I ordered the steak and shrimp which I rarely order but since we were splitting the check, it wouldn't be fair if I paid $66 dollars for a pizza or a chicken pot pie. Which by the way, the chicken pot pie is HUGE!  Overall, the restaurant is spacious for big parties.  Met up with my friend last night. Ordered the calamari since I wasn't that hungry. I must say, not really a martini person since some bartenders make it really strong. But my friend introduced me to the Georgia Peach and Hawaiian sunset and absolutely LOVED IT! Not too strong but a creeper, so beware.  My bf ordered the lobster burger and it was surprisingly delish!  We also had the same server from a couple of weeks ago which she also was fantastic!",

Half off most of the appetizers. Don't miss this one peeps!  The food is somewhat more than the average price but well worth it. About 15 dollars on average for an entree.   Our order:  Coconut Shrimp: About 13 dollars for 4 large shrrrammmppss. Yummy coconut crunchy goodness. 13 dollars worth? Eh. I would have liked it a bit cheaper. Garlic Noodles: Not your average garlic noodles. It was more buttery than garlicy. It's not what you taste in most Chinese restaurants. Sliders with sweet potato fries: decent. To me, they were just a bit average. But nonetheless, good.  It's a bit dark inside. Sets the mood. :op  Yardhouse, I like you. Yes, I truly do.",

    "text": "Not sure what's more embarrassing: the fact that the other day before going to see the Master at rave (two thumbs up!) that I spent $120 on dinner for 2 at Yard House, or the fact that I thought it was worth every penny.  This is not to say that the average opinion on the Yardhouse is low, but I do think it's typically thought of as a place to grab some cheap happy hour appetizers and some beer and not a place to spend $30 on entrees.  Well I did that, and I was damn happy with the results.  We arrived shortly before happy hour ended and I started with a Black and Tan and we also ordered the seared Ahi Sashimi appetizer which I was pleasantly surprised to find half off on the happy hour menu (which also discounted the price on the beer a bit).   I've had the Ahi appetizer here several times and it's almost always a winner.  I'll venture to say it's the best of it's kind among chain restaurants.  For entrees my dining partner got the Pepper crusted Filet Mignon and I ordered the Ginger Crusted Norwegian Salmon.   Both were accompanied with Wasabi mashed potatoes which I've always enjoyed for that slight hint of wasabi in every bite.  My salmon was a little masked with all the toppings (namely carrot strings, the ginger crust, and the sesame vinaigrette).   Usually I would find this to be a negative, but I''ll be damned if all of the ingredients really work together here.  I've been known to sneak a bite of the salmon on it's own from time to time anyhow and found it to be nicely cooked.  The one issue with the entire meal was the filet which was ordered medium was a little inconsistently cooked.  Some of it seemed cooked Medium well (little to no pink) while some of it did seem cooked as ordered.  I was able to taste a little of both sections and found them both tasty, though the one with some pink was more to my liking.    Service was great throughout and we ordered several jack and cokes once happy hour ended and they were constantly being refreshed.  When we informed the waitress we had a movie to make she made sure to bring the check to us quickly.  When the check first arrived I was slightly taken aback by the price (and the amount of alcohol we'd consumed), but realized it had been worth it.  It also made me appreciate that I could go into the Yardhouse and make a choice on whether to have a great $30 experience of a couple of drinks, an onion ring tower and a sandwich, or go all out and have a great steak or piece of fish for extra.  You can't do that (or much of anything else) at Applebee's folks!    Later on in the theater while everyone else was fleeing for the exit midway through, we sat content.  I initially blamed this on poor movie taste by the others, but in retrospect perhaps it was the contentedness of the meal beforehand that transferred over to our cinema experience.",

My friend ordered a beer I asked if I could get a sample of that same beer. She said okay and came back with 1 full glass and said you can just sample out of hers! Seriously! who says that? I ordered my beverage she gave it to me and walked away.. And never came back we sat there for 15 minutes until someone else acknowledged us and took our order. When I asked for my check she still wasn't very friendly and just had this worst attitude. I had the happy hour noodles! It was absolutely ridiculously delicious! For being something so simple and great portion size too! At least my food made up for the lack of service I got.",

This location can get really packed during Thur-Sun night and being located in Town Square that's fairly common with the establishments they have here with the exception of Kabuki.  They have a big selection of beers on tap in Yard House.  But with the way I am I don't  take advantage of trying out other selections. I'm a Guinness and Bud Light guy. The setting is like any other Yard House and the pretty friendly crowd.  No complaints here except at times its hard to catch the Bartenders attention.  If you're not looking to party but just want to hang out with friends to drink, eat, and watch sports, Yard House is the place to be in Town Square.",

The place reminded me a lot of BJ's restaurant, although this place had more of a different twist to their menu.  They also serve a ton of beer!  The display of all of the beer kegs right when you enter is quite impressive!  Since I'm not much of a beer drinker, I opted for the fruitier belgian drink called the Lindeman's Framboise.  It's seriously an alcoholic juice...very dangerous!    As for food, I think our eyes were hungrier than our stomachs!  We ordered the Truffle Fries (shredded parmesan and herbs) with a hint of garlic.  It was delish!  Then we ordered the Ahi Poke Bowl with some fried wontons that were also quite tasty.  Then we ordered Pastrami sliders which did not meet my standards.  I have had better pastrami burgers and this one was on the salty side.  The hubby also ordered Moo  Shu Egg Rolls (no good) and Chinese Garlic Noodles.  Maybe I was delusional to think that the garlic noodles would come close to Thanh Long's.    All in all, if you want lots of beer variety and a good atmosphere, then this place is for you.  Just don't expect them to excel in the food department.",

I went to LV for the first time last weekend and some local friends took a few of us non-local folks out for dinner Saturday night and boy did they pick a great place! We had a group of 6 and the wait wasn't bad for a busy/packed restaurant. They said it was their favorite spot and I'm sure glad we went off the strip to grab a bite to eat because they were right, this place really is great!  Their beer selection is huge, the food all sounds great and I definitely had a hard time trying to narrow down what I wanted. If only my tummy could consume as much food as my eyes could! We got several rounds of drinks, some appetizers (the sweet potato fries with sauce are soOoo tasty!), and then I chose the Crusted Parmesan Chicken with sun-dried tomato and mushroom sauce. I don't really even like mushrooms but I was a member of the clean plate club here! My husband got some garlic noodles and they were amazing! Mmmmm!  The server was super friendly, helpful, quick, and fun! We watched some games on tv's, laughed for a while, and had a great time. I wish that my hometown had this restaurant! The prices are great, the food presentation and quantity is awesome, and I would highly recommend checking this place out.   Cheers!",

    "text": "Yard House-- in the middle of the street-- Yard House!  A spin off of BJ's, but without the family feel to it. It's probably one of the biggest and famous chain of restaurant slash bar slash sports bars I know of. They're not really known for anything else but the different draft beers that they serve here but since I don't drink alcohol, I wouldn't be very helpful in that department. The atmosphere right when you walk-in is of most restaurants similar to BJ's or Alehouse. You'll find your singles at the bar watching sports, the flock of females in booths wooing loudly because they're in Vegas or locals that are pretending they're tourists and still wooing loudly aka Woo Girls (c) How I Met Your Mother. And sometimes, you'll catch the party of 15 or more in the middle of the room trying to celebrate or have dinner with friends. That's us.  Yard House is pretty good about taking care of large groups. We celebrated my brother's birthday here and their service wasn't memorae but it wasn't horrible. They took our orders, gave us our food, checked on us to refill drinks, gave the check, and thanked us for coming in. Nothing out of the ordinary though. The happy hour menu (Sunday-Wednesday, 10pm-close) has a wide range of different eats! I highly recommend the garlic noodles, sliders with Bernaise sauce on the side, and the chicken wings! Superb! For something not on the happy hour is the New York steak salad. I'm not too sure how I feel about red meat on a salad because it's kind of a culinary oxymoron, but the way Yard House throws it together leaves me with some belief that there are chefs and cooks that know what they're doing in the kitchen! Comforting isn't it?   Last notes: Call ahead if you have large groups. The weekends are extremely busy!",
