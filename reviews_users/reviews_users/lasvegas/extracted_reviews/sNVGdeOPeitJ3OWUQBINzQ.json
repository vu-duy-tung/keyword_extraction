    "text": "Outstanding breakfast at an awesome price.  DW and I got off the strip and had one of the best meals of the trip for breakfast.  I had the loco moco which was outstanding and I can not wait to go back and have another one.  DW had an omelet which was good and I ate her short stack of pancakes which were also very good.  Service was awesome and the price with coffee and tip was under 30 bucks.  Compare that to the cold waffle I had the day before in a casino cafe (which cost 15 bucks) and you can see why I am so high on BabyStacks.  Once again if your in town visiting do not let the off strip location keep you from one of your best meals and values.",

We tried the Kahlua Pig Benedict (smoky goodness), BYOB. (built  my own omelet - egg whites, bacon, spinach, cheese, topped with green sauce - HUGE), Adobo Fried Rice (wasn't a fan, but a staple for everyone else), Spam, Eggs, and Rice and Corned Beef Hash and Eggs (need no further explicative needed), and they all came with pancakes. Not your everyday buttermilk Bisquick pancakes, but pancakes the BabyStacks way. Represented in order of deliciousness, we had Butterfinger (peanut butter batter, seriously... yeah), Orange Creamsicle with cream cheese sauce (really... yeah really, that's what the ice cream man said), Almond Joy (get a glass of milk for this chocolate, coconut wonder), Smores (build me a campfire, cause I'm eating), Banana Cream (\"What's that behind you?\" as I finish your monkey stack), and White Chocolate Macadamia (stick to this in cookie form). All-in-all, a great way to start your day (afternoon in Vegas) is at BabyStacks.",

    "text": "I went to brunch with a few friends last week. It came highly recommended by 2 of them, so I decided to make the out of the way drive to check it out. The wait was quoted to us at 20 min, but we waited closer to 45 min. The staff was very friendly though, and its not a very big place so you could clearly see people just hanging out at their table after eating. After the long wait I wanted to order everything on the menu!! Which was pretty decent size, a lot to choose from. Of course the red velvet pancakes were a must try, but I'm more of a bacon and eggs kinda person. I got the Piglet omelet (bacon, sausage, ham, and cheddar cheese) and red velvet pancakes, they charge a little more to get specialty pancakes but that's normal. The omelet was decent (not the best Ive ever had) but the pancakes were to die for. They serve pretty big portions though, so the pancakes are more like a breakfast desert. Which worked out well because i could only down a couple more bites of food at that point. All in all it was good, i would recommend it to friends, don't think ill be making the long drive to eat their too often though.",

    "text": "Always looking for a new place, and this one had some good reviews. We came here for breakfast last weekend. The menu looked awesome, tons of options, affordable prices. I was quite disappointed, however. As a girl who loves her breakfast meat, I decided to give the corned beef hash a shot. It came with 2 eggs, hash browns, and a short stack of pancakes. The atmosphere was comfortable, service was quick, and the food was out pretty fast. But when I got my plate, the corned beef hash looked more like a flattened out, dry piece of scrapple (PA Dutchies will know what I mean, or someone from the northeast:) AND. It didn't taste much better. Plus, the whole breakfast was cold. Well, luke warm, I guess, but not as hot as it should have been (cold eggs are gross).  The pancakes looked promising.  I went with the Cinnamon Bun (it was a compromise because I was sharing). But they were dry, and not hot either. And waay too sweet for my taste. I should have gone with my instinct and tried the bacon or carrot cake.  I was not disappointed to the point of not going back. I understand off days, and I don't get all in a huff about stuff ( watching people flip out in a restaurant makes me feel embarrassed for them). It was still good service, and had good conversation with surrounding tables. I may have just been unlucky that morning.",

The wait was not long enough :P as we didn't even get to finish our argument about what science experiments I could keep in the house :) and the food was delicious and abundant. I had the 2 egg plate (scrambled with just egg whites), hash-browns and a short stack of Carrot (pan)Cakes. They were flipping fantastic, especially with some hot sauce (which they brought without me asking, before my meal arrived). My guest ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes which only come in one size (fits all) and I tried some of it and we both agreed they were a triumph of breakfast food. The service was attentive and positive the whole time; except that they didn't bring us our check once it was obvious that we had finished our meals, which I've heard is polite but I prefer efficiency in my dining experience :P",

We came in yesterday (sunday 3/18) around 10 of course it was packed, we were greeted by 2 hostesses, 1 of which didn't really smile at all, the other had a huge smile on her face, she was the cashier, her name was Jordan. Cashing people out wasn't the only thing she was doing, i saw her running food, bussing tables, seating people and cashing them out. If you want a hostess she's one to have on your team, she was amazing, and i didn't see a flaw at all in her work, i'm sure there was and if there was i never saw.   we've come in a few times and have been greeted by her and i just think she's great. never rude, always has a smile on her face, friendly. she's someone they DEF need to have out serving people.",

Upon walking in the door, the hostess just kind of looked up and I had to initiate conversation. Ok, fine I wont judge the restaurant based on her. She did warm up when I was paying, but who doesn't like money? Now on to the most important part: the food! I had spam, eggs, and rice with furikake. Pretty standard, can't screw that up. It was good, nothing to write home about. But what I will rave about are the Cinnabun pancakes! Wow! It still doesnt beat my favorite banana brown sugar at Hash house, but these are also amazing.  My Dad had the Banana Cream Pie pancakes and those were also delicious, but I like cinnamon so I preferred my own.  This place is pretty solid, and the locals think so too cause this place was packed on a weekday! I would eat here again, no questions asked.",

We wanted to have breakfast together at the same time.  It was not busy.  Don't know if it was waiter or kitchen, but is was not an enjoyable breakfast.

And since we decided to sit at the bar, we cut the hour-long wait! Now I love my pancakes, and I love red velvet, so when you put the two of them together, I don't think you can really go wrong. And their red velvet pancakes were oh-so right! I ordered the country fried steak with the babystack of red velvet and my boyfriend ordered the adobo fried rice, also with the red velvet -- SO SO GOOD! ESPECIALLY the pancakes! It tasted like fluffy clouds of red velvet goodness in my mouth, topped with delicious cream cheese syrup! I almost forgot I ordered anything else, my steak was so neglected! The adobo fried rice was pretty awesome too! Super flavorful and wrapped in egg like a burrito -- I ate most of my boyfriend's plate. I only took off a star because after we finished eating, we were kind of neglected and had to wait at least 20 minutes for our check. But don't go here without ordering their red velvet pancakes! You will absolutely regret it!",

My boyfriend got the pig blanket omelette (not sure if name is correct) with hash browns and upgraded his stack to a special stack they called \"orange dream\". Now I'm not a rookie when it comes to Portuguese sausage so I must say that these were pretty good. Juicy, crispy on the edge but not overcooked. The eggs were eggs. Nothing extraordinary but still good. Now the breakfast potatoes, bland with no seasoning not even salt. They did come out hot so I'm sure I could've sprinkled salt on them but I didn't. Ketchup did just fine but I'm pretty sure I'll be getting the hash browns next time around. The red velvet pancakes actually tasted like red velvet and they were good. I remember my first visit when they were called babycakes and their red velvet pancakes were bleh. The kitchen must have finally perfected the recipe because they definitely are worth going back for. Now, as for my boyfriend I can't say that I tried his omelette but I can say he finished it all, so that must be a good sign. His orange dream pancakes...OMG they are to die for. Anyone who reads this, please do yourself a favor and stop by for an orange dream stack.",

However, I am a huge fan of creativity, and I definitely appreciate how they've married many desserts with classic pancakes.  Red Velvet Pancakes // WHAT?! Okay. I do have to admit that I have tried other better similar concoctions (i.e. red velvet waffles at Larchmont in LA and red velvet pancakes at the Grand Lux in the Venetian), but I was first introduced to these here at BabyStacks... so I have fond memories of this item!  Cookies n Cream Pancakes // I tried these babies for the first time today.  So good! I'm an Oreo lover, so I'm surprised I haven't tried these. I would definitely go for these rather than the Red Velvet from now on. I haven't seen these anywhere else before!  Biscuit & Gravy, Loco Moco, and Kalua Pork Benedict are some of the other items I've tried. Honestly, I wouldn't order any of those items again.  The pancake selection is awesome, but the pancakes themselves could use a little more fluffy... Still, a must-visit when in Vegas!",

Food was amazing. Country fried steak was juicy unlike many dried up ones that I've tried. I understand with this amount of business a lot of tables would be ideal, but it feels a bit crowded. Nonetheless, great breakfast joint. One of the best in South West Vegas.",

    "text": "I've been here a number of times already and I must say that I have been absolutely satisfied each and everytime I have been here.   The name is BabyStacks Cafe, so you can assume that they specialize in pancakes, and specialize they do! The front page of their menu has a list of different kinds of pancakes they serve. The red velvet is supposedly the most popular, and it is delicious, but my favorite is the cinnabun personally. I personally wouldn't recommend ordering plain pancakes here since they have so many different specialties, but if that's something you like, I don't think that'd be a bad decision either.   I usually order a skillet or omelette with a side of pancakes. It cost more to order specialty pancakes with your omelette or skillet, but you get the best of both worlds that way. I treat the pancakes like a dessert/side dish kind of thing because most of the pancakes are sweet. You get the main dish with eggs, meat, and maybe potatoes and then you have the pancakes on the side that that is just the perfect combination!  On the weekends, it gets kind of busy, so expect a wait unless you go fairly early and the service can be slow at times, but you can't expect every place to be overstaffed with people waiting to serve you when you come in. They do the best job they can. I remember I came here with many of my family members and we didn't get one of our orders of pancakes and they have us a free short stack of a random specialty pancake. I'm glad they made it up to us for not bringing our order in time because that showed me how much they care about their customer service.   I recommend going here if you want to catch some breakfast or lunch. I personally won't go to any other breakfast specialty place in Vegas while BabyStacks is open for business.",

I think this is my new favorite place!  The server was very sweet and helped us make our choices.   I got the bacon and eggs and they were delicious. My mom got the corned beef hash which she thought was a bit dry. She also ordered the sweet creme crepes with banana and they were PHENOMENAL! The pancakes were fluffy and delicious. I recommend trying the crepes the next time you come here!!! Definitely check it out :)",

We didn't mind the wait because we were a party of 10 but the hostesses were just rude and didn't seem to care to be there.   She calls our name and not even a second later calls it again all annoyed like us having to pick up my nephews car seat was such an inconvenience to wait a second!  Our server didn't help the situation either.  He didn't introduce himself,  was getting irritated because 3 of the party of 10 wanted their pancake toppings on the side.  To top it off he goes ahead and decides to make it so that everyone gets their pancakes toppings on the side..  So we got the joy of having to spread Nutella on 4 kids orders of Nutella Pancakes and do the red velvet pancakes as well as.  If it wasn't for the food being so good this place would have gotten 1 star honestly.  Got checked on by the server once and never got out water refilled...  The food was delicious, but I definitely will not go back to this location.  Adobo Fried Rice (Adobo Omelette) was on point.  Perfect rice to adobo ratio and the egg was not to thin or thick just right.  (It was colder then I would like but it wasn't the cook who decided to mess up my kids orders.)  Kids Nutella and Red Velvet Pancake orders were both great but they might have just been bomb because we put the toppings on ourselves haha.  Naw seriously though the batter mix was good it wasn't overly fluffy or too thick it was perfect.  Great food (5 stars),  not so great service (1 star because I don't think I can give a 0)!",

Eggs were cooked to perfection.   Only real complaint I have for this place was that I found a small hair in my pancakes, but this didn't bother me too much.  When the servers came around with the food. The plates are held on top of the food and touching the food. The bottom of the plate is touching the food, which could potentially impose a health problem. The bottom of the plates sit on dirty counters, so seeing that they stack the plates on top of the food that is served to customers disgusted me.",

Their hand written note on the register rudely states \"NO EXCEPTIONS!!\"  My coworker and I sat at the bar to have some lunch. I asked the waiter if he could take our orders separately so we could pay separately. I was looking for a loophole in their ridiculous policy. He states that they cannot separate checks. I replied I understand that for the tables but we are sitting at the bar. He explained that we \"came in together\" therefore we could not pay separately. My coworker said \"Then what if we sat here and didn't know each other? Would we still have to pay together?\"  The waiter begins to look around and under his breath he slyly tells us \"Well they are separate seats so I guess I can take your orders separately\". He took our orders and commented a couple more times about it.  I have no problem with the waiter. He was a nice guy and he was following policy. My problem is with management who apparently doesn't realize that a restaurant is a customer service based business. Coworkers are a large portion of lunch business and less people carry cash as time goes on. We are on lunch from work, not on a date and have our own methods of payment.  This was my third trip here with the same payment hassles. I will not be back.",

It will change your view of Loco Moco forever! Go with the garlic rice, too. A must!  **Kalua Pork Benedicts-Disappointed! The flavors didn't work well together and it was so bland. I only had a few bites and gave up...I was tremendously unsatisfied that I had to order another Loco Moco to fill in that void!    **Red Velvet Pancakes-BOMB! It's better to eat this fresh so if you plan to eat this for dessert like me, order the pancakes when you're halfway through your savory dish. The cream cheese syrup is just amazing and not too sweet! Try not to add too much of the whipped cream in each bite so you can really enjoy the flavors of the pancake. For me, the short stack is just the perfect portion.   **Lemon Ricotta Pancakes-Just wonderful! It's light, fluffy, and simply refreshing. The citrus flavor of the lemon is really enhanced with the cream cheese syrup. There's no short stack option for this so plan to share because it's huge.   **Portuguese sausage sliders-Not impressed. Hawaiian rolls with Portuguese sausage and eggs scrambled with green onions. It's good but it's something you can make yourself at home..maybe better!   Servers here were so attentive and friendly. We came here for Mother's Day brunch so it was really busy. That didn't stop them from giving us good service. Will definitely be back!!",

They do have a big menu but I was fixated on the pancakes.  (There are egg dishes and ... Oh Yea... Spam dishes and Adobo Fried Rice on the breakfast menu... but I just couldn't order it all in 1 sitting .... Must Go Back!)  So... I had the Bananas Foster French Toast.  As you might expect... it was sweet. But Oh So Good!  I did wipe most of the whipped cream off of it.  And I should have asked for the syrup on the side rather than have them slather the whole plate in syrup.  Next time... I'll know better.  The bananas foster was good but like I mentioned to my friends... needed more rum.  :)  LOL!  That's just how I roll though.  :)  I did like it a lot though.  My girlfriend had the nutella pancakes and she pretty much licked the plate clean too.  So... all in all... a success.  My other 2 girlfriends opted for egg dishes and they enjoyed their breakfasts too.  None of us had a bad thing to say.    The ambience is diner-like... small and tables are kinda close together. There's usually ALWAYS a wait on the weekend.... so be prepared to wait.  They do have a lunch menu too... who knew?!  But I love breakfast and would probably always order off of the breakfast menu.  :)",

We ordered 2 breakfast \"skillets\" and pancakes (peanut butter & chocolate and rocky road). The skillets are not skillets at all. The veggies are not cooked with the eggs & our veggies were raw. The serving sizes seem smaller than the other location. Pancakes were still delish!! Service & the 'cakes are what pushed this from a 3 to 4 star. Might add this to our breakfast rotation, but we have to figure out their down times for sure.",

And let's not forget about their pancakes, delicious.   The only downfall would be the waiting time. I mean if you go right when they open you're good. But if you go a little past their opening time. Chances are you will probably have to wait. But I honestly think it's worth the wait.   P.S the one of Diamond wasn't as packed and we didn't have to wait at all.   Please extend your locations to California. Maybe LA?:)",

They were waiting for the full party of 2 to get there. A little silly, but whatever. I wanted food.   I was pretty indecisive about trying a new type of pancake, but my friend convinced me to try the banana cream pie pancakes. I had the country fried steak with an upgrade to the banana cream pie pancakes for $1.50 more. My friend had the Portuguese sausage & eggs with garlic rice with an upgrade to (I want to say) rocky road pancakes. (I was distracted by my own food I don't remember. Fail. :/)Both of our entrees were delicious! I loved how crispy my steak was & the gravy was savory. As far as our pancakes.. both tasted exactly as they are described. Definitely some good stuff!   Whenever I want red velvet pancakes I have to go to Babystacks. Now, I have a new favorite: banana cream pie pancakes! YUM!!",

It was probably around 10am on a Wednesday or Thursday and they were still surprisingly busy. Almost every table full, but we didn't have to wait. The restaurant is small and it got a bit warm with all the food and people but our experience was still enjoyable. My husband got the Piglet Omelette and a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. The omelette was good, but felt like it'd be better with peppers and onions added. The Red Velvet Pancakes tasted just like your eating a cupcake. I wanted something different and ordered the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and a side of bacon. The bacon was ordinary but the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes were amazing. The portion is humongous! The pancakes are thin, moist and lighter than most pancakes but they were just as filling. Service was a little slow but we give them a pass because they were busy, but everyone was friendly and helpful. I look forward to going back and trying more of their pancake flavors.",

There are several unique items on their menu you won't find at other breakfast places (like Portuguese sausage). The pancakes-- as mentioned in just about every review here, the red velvet pancakes are amazing...but honestly you can't go wrong on any of their specialty pancakes. I will say that the service is not great and a few of their policies aren't the friendliest (no seating until your whole party has arrived, no splitting checks), but these drawbacks are more than made up for in the food, which is my ultimate reason for going to a restaurant! I will gladly put up with mediocre service so long as the food is great, which it assuredly is at Babystacks.",

The many Hawaiian influenced plates are some of the best, though they are obviously well known for pancakes. I tried the Kalua Benedict with a short stack of banana cream panacakes. Pancakes were lovely and hit the spot. The benedict was tasty, larticularly with the smoked pulled pork. However, my hollandaise had the same typical taste and texture you would find at any cheap breakfast joint (as if it came out of a jar), and the poached eggs were overcooked. The yolk did not run at all which is a sin when serving benedict or even just poached eggs. It showed a lack of detail and commitment to the food they serve. It seems a shame as they clearly have some nice plates and flavors but without the execution you are only just slightly better than an ihop or dennys. My wife's skillet was alright but she didn't finish it. Service was alright but overall the experience wasn't enough to really bring me back.",

The wait wasn't too long and the servers were excellent and very polite. The menu has a very large selection so it took us a bit to order. We finally decided to try the skillets and pancakes. our table was very wobbly and as I uncrossed my legs I bumped the table and coffee went everywhere (great morning so far). my cup had a smear of lipstick on it and when I mentioned it to a waitress she told me it was okay (as if I had made a mistake) and asked another waiter for a \"fresh cup\". I'm really hoping she just didn't hear me. That waiter got me a fresh cup and put some sugar packets under the leg of the table to even it out. I finally get to try my coffee and it's very bland. As I set my cup down I notice some pink stuff on the side and I scraped it off with my nail- it was crusted on- great just great. So, no coffee for me. If you've ever been to an Ihop this is no different. Maybe they were having a bad day. Oh and my husband mentioned the women's bathroom was out of order so everyone had to use the men's and he said it pretty messy. Needless to say we will not return:(",

Kids chose short stack of smores and rocky road.  Smores tasted just like smores and moist, rocky road was a little more dry bc pancakes were chocolate.  I had Huntington omelette which was ok.  Not very much flavor or cheese.  Great service, but did have to wait 30 minutes to be seated but that is expected on Sunday @11 in Vegas!  Would go there again.",

I ordered the Country Fried Steak and Eggs w/ seasoned potatoes and side stack of Red Velvet cakes.  YUM, YUM, YUM! I decided long and hard after mulling over the menu that I needed to have my savory and sweet! Country gravy was made with real ham and not at all heavy.  More creamy and just the perfect amount smeared on the steak.  The potatoes are so good! Like little steak fries! And probably the best part was the Red Velvet Stacks! So incredibly light and tasty, just like a cupcake except topped off with homemade whip cream and dusted with some chocolate shavings! OUR mistake to not include the cream cheese sauce it arrived with was disheartening but I may go without again.    Hubbs ordered the massive Rick's rice and Egg omlet and it was HUGE! Super tasty too! Never thought that combo of rice inside a massive omlet could be so good. I think that the macaroni salad tasted almost like kimchi and so I could not wrap myself around it.  I was very impressed with the selection of brunch items and the array of stacks that they offer.  I will be back and probably never be able to lose weight because of you, BabyStacks!",

Wish they had groupon or living social deals to make it affordable and then I'd come 2-3x a week vs once a week.  Weekdays are not as busy.   Weekend be prepared for a wait.  You gotta come here.

So far I've only had the Piglet omelet which consists of sausage, ham and bacon with seasoned potatoes.  I've also had the eggs with portuguese sausage which was really good too.   But lets face it, we come here for the pancakes!!  These things are phenomenal!  The first time I tried the Red Velvet short stack which was incredible.  On my second visit I had the Carrot Cakes and holy hell where they awesome!!  It was like eating carrot cake which I love, without the consistency of the cake, but the softness of the pancake!  The only reason I'm not giving this place 5 stars is because the regular breakfast, although good, is just regular breakfast.  Nothing to special about it.  But like I said, its all about the pancakes here, and those get 5 stars!",

The place looks nice though so kudos for that but the food is a whole different story. Not worth the $40++ price tag most definitely. My husbands plate was so sad with the corned beef looking so unappetizing, taste was boring. My Portuguese sausage plate wasn't much better either, the egg was slimy and gross. The only saving grace was the garlic fried rice which was pretty good. I order the Lemon Ricotta pancakes on the side with the cream cheese syrup, normally that's my go to but for some odd reason that day it had a weird uncooked batter aftertaste to it. Service was ok, a little bit of a wait as can be expected given the place gets super busy.   I'm rarely impressed with island style breakfast places and this just solidifies it. I'll stick with making my own macadamia nut pancakes, Kimchi fried rice, corned beef, and eggs the way I like it at home. I don't see the appeal of this place anymore, I don't think I'll be back.",

I enjoyed the \"island\" feel of the decor and coziness of the restaurant.  Ordered many dishes off the menu which my girlfriends and I shared. Had the Red Velvet Pancakes which was moist and tasty. A great dish if you like Red Velvet.  Also shared the Bananas Foster pancakes which tasted just like breakfast version of the dessert. Had the Cinnabun pancakes which were deliciously sweet and reminded me of a Cinnabon. Definitely on the sweet side but I'm a fan of sweets.  Also ordered the Loco Moco and I thought their gravy was good. Lolo Ricks Adobo Fried Rice is winner and a must too order. It's perfect with the egg it's wrapped in.  Overall, we had a very enjoyable breakfast which was worth the drive off the strip.",

    "text": "First, I've gotta say that I love the Babystacks in mountains edge. We go there every week, and it's fantastic.   The AC was out today, so we decided to come here.   Big mistake.   Service was marginal. The place was kinda busy, but still; it shouldn't take more than 5 minutes to be offered a drink.     Then it took a while for the drinks to arrive so we could order.   I ordered rancheros (which I've had many times). It took forever for our food to arrive.   When we got it, I found out why. My eggs were hard as a rock. I think they put them in a panini press they were so over cooked.   When I flagged our server down, I just told him to take it away. He was going to just take the eggs and redo them, but since it took so long... we just didn't have time to wait for it.   And seriously, why didn't they make me another meal?    When I told him to take it way. He didn't. He just left it there.   As we were leaving, the hostess asked, \"how was it?\"  I said, \"terrible.\"  She giggled.  Then Shae looked at the check and said, \"you have a comp.\".   So we're clear, it's not a comp if you didn't get to eat it.   It just means I didn't pay for something you didn't get.   That's like saying Amazon comped you a shirt they never sent you.",

Ok upon arrival we were lacklusterly greeted by a woman who I think may have been the manager ( kudos to having a female management staff at all their locations), she seated us at a almost clean but sticky table and crumb ridden seats, we were greeted by an ok , waitress who I don't think even gave us her name or was so average that it was forgotten quickly , we ordered and didn't get refills of water , and food was delivered I ordered the Mexican skillet , with carnitas and country potato that were warm at best , my over medium eggs were over hard and pancake side was barely warm , the butter congealed rather then melted , my roommate created his own breakfast with ala carte items including the carrot cake pancake which was good but barely warm , the only standout was his side of bacon which was thick and salty , delish !! All in all a very un enthusiastic meh !! Probably won't be back !",

These pancakes are a little thinner than the regular pancakes. The pancakes are flavored with a hint of lemon, making them slightly sour. The pancakes are dusted with confectioners' sugar and has a sweet and tangy lemon syrup that you drizzle all over the pancakes. This syrup is surprisingly sweet and just slightly tart. The contrast of sweet and tartness gives the pancake and the sauce a wonderful flavor that meshes well together. I highly recommend trying this dish!",

Probably, the only reason why I didn't give this place 5 stars. However, what stood out was the red velvet pancakes which were amazingly delicious. I am not usually a big fan of pancakes, more of French toast type of a guy, but this place changed my mind. My goodness, I would come back to place to order more pancakes. It was so fluffy, light, airy, and the sweetness was perfect. It wasn't overwhelming nor was it void of any kind of sugary taste.",

Kalbi & Eggs came out really good! $1 extra to substitute your white rice for garlic fried rice!!!!  Lastly the large variety of pancakes was impressive, although I only got buttermilk.

Some of the people looked like they didn't sleep at all with their dresses and New Year's eve hats!    I needed to go to a Hawaiian breakfast place this time because what I was craving you would not find in your local IHOP. I decided to wait the 30 minutes even though I was super hungry.  I ordered the Kalbi (beef short rib) , upgraded to the garlic fried rice and an over easy egg. I like to mix the egg yolk in my rice. (Learned habit from childhood) . It was delicious and just what I needed!   I figured while I was there I would also get a side of their Lemon Ricotta crepes. It may  sound weird but spritz them with some lemon and drizzle some of the white sugary topping and you are set! I haven't encountered any crepes like this anywhere else in Vegas so I made sure to have some since I don't come here all the time. I also had the white chocolate/ macadamia nut pancakes . You can upgrade from a buttermilk pancake to one of their specialty cakes for a small price.     The service is great even though it can get really busy .That being said please allow around  30 minute wait time .",

My friend Jeff ordered the Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, upgraded to garlic rice (additional $1.00), and had a side of red velvet pancakes - must try!!  I ordered a veggie omelette; there's one already pre-selected on the menu or you can build your own. The omelette comes with a side of fruit or breakfast potatoes and your choice of toast.  They have a big selection to choose from on their menu and their portions are big. This is a great spot if you're a local. You're taste buds will thank you!!   Just a little FYI: They won't seat you unless you're entire party has arrived and they don't split checks.",

I demolished my strawberry pancakes and I only ate half of my Spam scramble. My cousin got the adobo omelette and he prefers the one at Baby Stacks over Aloha Kitchen. At Baby Stacks, they use fluffier egg whereas at Aloha Kitchen, they egg looks skimpy.  Food was good. Parking was plenty. Oh, and they don't split checks here! And you pay at the register!",

    "text": "Baby Stacks is a breakfast spot, with a generous selection of \"yummy\" pancakes and a strong Hawaiian influence. Their portion sizes are smaller than other restaurants, but their prices are higher. I've eaten here a few times, but never been blown away with the food or service.   They appeal to the Hawaiian/Filipino market specifically, with staples like garlic rice and Portuguese sausage. FYI, if you plan on interacting with ANYONE after eating here - do not order the garlic rice. You could murder a vampire with your breath.  The \"star\" of this joint are the pancakes, which come in short stacks. They have a myriad of flavors and toppings, most of which carry an artificial candy-like flavor. Do not expect leftovers, as stated before the portion sizes are significantly smaller than what you would expect from the price.   I'm not an advocate of huge portions, quite the opposite. But i am a cost sensitive consumer, who can see value in quality or quantity. Neither of these metrics are met to justify menu pricing here.  Baby Stacks is a classic example of current Las Vegas local cuisine, shameless appeal to a niche market and no single item is exceptional.",

My family and I, visiting from CA, decided to visit  original restaurants rather than the typical food provided by the venues of the Strip. I was craving pancakes and searched up this location which is a good 20 minute drive from Downtown Las Vegas.   This Filipino-Hawaiian restaurant did not disappoint. We arrived at the peak of lunch and did not wait too long until we were seated. The venue displayed a unique style which I enjoyed. Additionally the service and the employees were delightful and kind!   The food was exceptional. Whether it was their vast selection of pancakes, omelettes, or more...there was definitely options for everyone. My family of 5 ordered different plates and were all satisfied! The food did take a while to arrive at our table, however. But the taste was original and great for individual portions!   I will definitely be back soon! Mahalo & Salamat!",

So we sat down and waited. About 5 min into waiting another couple came in and they are seated immediately. At first I thought maybe they had reservations. But no, they have a big sign on the front counter that says they don't do reservations it's first come first sever. The two girls at the front were just sitting there gossiping and having fun. Didn't think twice to seat us or that we were waiting. ( very unprofessional, especially when they are the first people you talk to at the restaurant ). When we do get seated we get seated in the very, I mean VERY back of the restaurant right next to the storage closet and bathroom! The table was barley big enough for one person... The food here is mediocre, not worth the horrible service.",

It tasted fairly close to an actual red velvet cupcake.  I hate pancakes but this one it was good.  However wish they had a smaller stack bc we couldn't finish it.  It's not a meal, it's more of sharing with everyone for couple bites and your good.    Galbi with garlic rice, oh the rice was good. It didn't have too much flavor but it was good.

    "text": "Being from LA baby stacks was introduced to us by our good friends who live locally. Our first visit was at the Henderson location and from what we remember it was exceptional. Coming from there we expect everything to be the same. The dining area is clean and dare I say hip? The staff is friendly and accommodate to their customers and that's always important to us as patrons. The wait time for us was quick although we arrived 1hr before closing so we caught the tail end of people leaving.    We ordered the usual breakfast items with the exception of the abobo omelette which I'm sorry but Aloha kitchen is far better. It was rather small and the taste wasn't anything to write home about. I think the biggest disappointment was the original pancake and that was a big surprise considering they are called baby stacks. It was super dry dispite having butter and being drenched in syrup. I literally couldn't swallow it and end up spitting it out which was the 1st time ever! Congratulations on becoming the worst pancake I have ever had in my 40 years of life. They did remake it and it was a little better but I now know I truly dislike pancakes that are cake like. On the flip side we also had the red velvet pancakes which was more palatable and pleasant to eat, I'm guessing it's because red velvet was originally meant to be a cake. I don't think I will be returning to this location. Seriously if a normal pancake won't pass muster then we're pretty much done.",

Service has always been great for us. I have nothing to complain about with BabyStacks.  One note: Go in as small a group as possible. The wait is usually long if there's more than 3-4 people in a group.",

Once you visit, you'll already be planning your next stop because our bodies aren't capable of eating all the brilliant selections they've put on their menu.  Where to start? Kahlua pork eggs benedict. Red Velvet pancakes which the family always shares for dessert. But you can never go wrong with any flavor of pancake which catches your eye.",

My boyfriend and I wanted to try a little bit of everything, so I got the carnitas omelette and upgraded my pancakes to the banana's fosters pancakes, and he got the ranchero omelette and upgraded his pancakes to the caramel apple pancakes. I don't know what spurred me to get the carnitas omelette, as I rarely if ever eat meat, but it may have changed my mind on that front. The eggs were fluffy, the meat was tender, and the taste was above and beyond what I was expecting. The pancakes though...the pancakes are what really blew me away. I'm obsessed with pancakes, and I get them wherever I go, and I have never had better pancakes in my life. Fluffy, tender, with unique flavors, these pancakes are making me consider driving all the way back down there just to try another flavor. Obviously I tried my boyfriend's dishes as well (I AM a woman) and they were equally out of this world. The service was top notch and friendly to boot. If I had one complaint, it would be that the interiors of each location are pretty small and crowded, but again, totally worth it.",

These combined with a cup of coffee = heaven.  The bf ordered the HM1 Skillet that to our surprise, didn't taste like any old skillet, it actually had flavor! And lots of it!

But now if I'm hungry and can muster up enough residual energy in the morning to get all they south on Buffalo to their new location I can have a great breakfast and nearly immediate seating.    I've had pancakes, I've had adobo fried rice, and I've had the regular breakfast fare in past visits and have been satisfied with all my choices.  This is a place I like since my coffee cup never goes empty, I leave just full enough, and everything looks like it would in a picture menu, made with care and ready to be devoured.    So if you want a varied menu with unique breakfast items along with traditional favorites and varying twists, then this is certainly a place to visit.  The northern location has limited seating but this location on South Buffalo is far bigger with the same greatness as the original.",

After about 30 minutes, we were finally seated. I noticed a few things that they could improve on right away. The hostess was rather cold, when people are waiting for extended periods of time for a table, kindness and a smile go a long way. They also have a very small counter area, which I assumed was an option when you placed your name on the list. To my surprise, two couples walked in and went right to the counter! They didn't even tell us that it was first come first served, you don't have to add your name to the list for counter seating! Again, they need to get better control over that because we were not the only group that was upset when we realized this. We waited 30 minutes and two couples walked right in and sat down.They should have everyone add their name to the list and then offer the counter as it becomes available.  Now, onto the food! I got a short stack of their famous red velvet pancakes! As stated by many other yelpers, they were so dreamy! They were moist, delicious, and the cream cheese syrup was divine. They are a little sweet, but not so much that you feel like you are eating cupcakes for breakfast. The short stack was the perfect size, I cleaned my plate but I was definitely full. I was also able to sneak a bite of my husband's banana cream pie pancakes, which were just as tasty.  I was also lucky enough to try their Kalua pig Benedict. The hollandaise sauce was out of this world and worked very well with the rest of the dish. The shredded pork and cabbage were fantastic and overall the dish was very well balanced. They also have delicious seasoned potatoes and hash browns that seem simple but are a really flavorful accompaniment.  Overall, the food is fantastic! I love the way that they designed the menu, almost everything you order comes with pancakes. Unfortunately, they have a few kinks to work out, but the food is so worth the wait. I wish they would open a location in Henderson so I could work them into my weekend brunch routine!",

It's a must order for any Baby virgin. 6 pancakes come in a full stack.  We also ordered the Portuguese Sausage and Eggs. For less than 2 bucks, you can upgrade regular pancakes to specialty. We got the carrot cake which were yummy but the red velvet trumps them all.  Be sure to take advantage of the current Yelp deal - 15 dollars for 7 bucks.

Was not in the mood for breakfast so had a sandwich it was still very good. I do want to come back and try the breakfast out. Service was friendly and quick. Will be back",

Four of us arrived an hour before we were given a table bit that us NOT the reason why this establishment deserves NO stars. It is because their manager says, \"fuck you, get out\" after we asked to be moved to a different table since we were split into two. What kind of hospitality is this? Surely this establishment should be out of business.",

It's like an explosion of flavors in your mouth! The red velvet pancake is to die for.   I'm from Hawaii so it was a surprise to see Hawaiian dishes served here.  To all the Hawaiians in Las Vegas this place give Cinnamons Restaurant HARD RUBS! Plus they serve Zippy's Chilli here!!! I tried the Adobe Fried Rice Omelette and the Kailua Pig Benedict! A+ in my books!  The staff was wonderful! Very friendly and very prompt.  They filled our drinks when needed and provided a smile every time they came by.    I know this is random but their water was so good! Very Cold and tasted fresh! That is also a plus for me when checking out a new restaurant as you know you don't always want to get drinks. So rest assured if you want water here your gonna have a good one.   Price is very reasonable for the taste your are going to receive.  The portions are more than decent to get you full and possible end up taking some to go!  I had a great overall experience as a first timer.  I don't live next to this area but with the results of having a friendly staff, amazing food, and decent prices I will not hesitate to take a drive to eat here again!",

I had the Cinnabun pancakes with a side of bacon crispy.  Everything came exactly as I ordered it and the bacon was the perfect amount of crisp without being burnt.  Unless you're sharing the pancakes, a short stack is plenty.  I wound up bringing half of my full-stack home with me.  My only complaint is that when I reheated the pancakes, the salt taste really came out and they tasted horrible reheated.  They were delicious when they were fresh, but I don't know what happened between the restaurant and home.    If you're an indecisive eater, this is not the place for you.  The menu has sufficient options to keep you trying to decide for days.  It's great for those of us who like to try different things each time though!",

My wait was only about 10 -15 minutes-ish, which is fine for me.  Was sat down and ordered the scrambled eggs with diced spam and furikake on rice. I know, so Hawaiian of me. My friend ordered biscuit something and something egg. I didn't care, I was just eggs-cited for my egg. Haha, pun intended.   Got my food and took a bite of of the scrambled egg and spam. Eh, it's alright. The egg was still runny as if it wasn't cooked enough OR not scrambled enough. The spam was still pink as if it just came out of the can. Oh yeah, especially the rice. I'm Asian and I know what rice is supposed to taste like. It was really undercook, kinda hard and very dry. It wasn't great, it was just undercooked.   Been here once before and the food was amazing. Now, I really wouldn't come back on a busy day knowing that BabyStacks Cafe wouldn't be able to maintain the quality of their food regardless of the traffic.",

For a tiny container of whipped cream! I sat others at the tables eating with more whipped cream on their pancakes than what I was asking for. I dont understand how that is at all fair in the owners eyes.

If you like pancakes and Filipino breakfast then this will definitely hit the spot. Our group got a bunch of different pancakes and breakfast foods but I got the corned beef hash with hash browns. I shoulda gotten rice but I upgraded my pancakes to red velvet pancakes which were sooo tasty. I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes and they were light and the sweet but sourness of the lemon cut whatever overload of savoriness I got from my corned beef. My friends also loved their banana pancakes so I'm sure any pancake you choose, you'll love!   There were 9 of us (mostly dudes) and a little rowdy/inattentive but our server was really patient and sweet (haha she spilled one of our waters as punishment... just kidding!!) Our waters and coffee were always topped off and checked if we needed anything despite how busy it was. We didn't catch her name but hopefully we can extend our thanks!",

Their g-rice was very good. The only thing was the patties were a little tough.  My wifey got the corned beef hash-  with g-rice! Nice portion. One egg yolk was running out of the sunnyside up though.  I'll go back to try their pancakes and spam & eggs next time.",

    "text": "Ok this review is definitely overdue...like...5 years overdue.  We come to BabyStacks every time we're in Vegas and it does not disappoint. We've even gotten takeout from here when we can't make our way to the physical restaurant.   Things we always get: - Loco moco; always ask for the garlic rice upgrade. I think like 2-3 people in my party always end up getting loco moco even though we think we won't. The gravy is so savory and delicious and I personally always get the mac salad which helps add a different flavor. - Red velvet pancakes; ok so I could pay for the upgrade for the pancake side, but I tend to order the pancakes by themselves. There's no pancakes like these red velvet ones. It's actually heaven in your mouth that's a perfect marriage between sweetness and fluffiness. Definitely ALWAYS get these. - Other favorites: adobo fried rice, chili loco moco  We haven't had a bad meal here before. This location is also larger than the others and it is usually faster to get a table, but quality wise, all locations are still great.",

    "text": "Heard of this place through a friend that really wanted to go try their loco moco. So we went on a Thursday around 11, on a little time crunch. Thankfully we were seated right away and immediately took our drink order. Since everyone in here talked about adding the garlic rice ( extra $1) with the loco moco, I followed their advice, and chose scrambled eggs and man, was it a good idea! First of all, the brown, sauce on top was so thick, and flavorful, anything that it touch on my plate gave it the extra flavor and made the food so much better! The meat itself was so soft and tender that you can cut it with a spoon (my friend likes to not use the knife if he can), and definitely enhanced the flavor. The garlic rice was good and I was able to taste the garlic, but it wasn't overpowering. And last but not least the egg. I like it scrambled but I guess the usual way is to have it be sunny side up. It does a good job blending all the other parts of the food together to make it cohesive. The only downside I have to this is the hash browns. The inside looked like mush and the sides are crunchy.  Overall, I would encourage people to go try this place and even come back too! Next time, I'll even go for the chili moco and maybe even the pancakes, since it's the name of their restaurant!",

My date had the loco moco which I thought was good but the gravy was a little bland and flat. The red velvet pancakes are a must as well. The service was also great. The place gets really packed and prepared to wait for a bit for a table. Also, I know that it's a breakfast/brunch place so it would make sense they'd close early, but I just wish they opened all day. That's just me, though, for when I get craving for some Portuguese sausage. Other than that, great place and definitely worth coming back to.",

    "text": "This is the breakfast place to go to if you want friendly service and ethnic/old-fashioned American variety of food. They have everything from pancakes to omelets, spam, adobo fried rice, furikake, and other choices. The interior has a casual vibe, and when you walk in, you feel like you are in a Hawaiian diner. The servers are quick to come to your table once you are seated, and they hand you your drinks and food promptly. They don't rush you when you are taking your time deciding what to order!  My boyfriend and I ordered the chili loco moco with garlic rice and breakfast potatoes on the side, a side of onion rings, and the kalua grilled cheese with a side of red velvet pancakes.   The chili loco moco was this gigantic mountain of all around yummy savory ingredients. On the bottom was a bed of garlic infused fried white rice (cost a little bit extra than normal white rice), then a thick layer of chargrilled hamburger meat sitting atop. There is an option to upgrade to kahlua pork for an extra charge. You have the choice of sunny side up or scrambled eggs as the next layer. Our scrambled eggs were soft, fluffy, and enough to balance the hearty texture of the hamburger. Then 2 slices of melted velveeta cheese are placed on the egg. The meaty, beany, tomato-ey chili was the final touch to this dish, topped with some diced raw onion. If you are looking for something heavy, an eating experience with multiple textures, or are planning to nap after your meal, I recommend eating this.   The breakfast potatoes had a crisp, lightly spiced exterior with brown edges! This was a good juxtaposition to the soft inner potato. I ate these with some ketchup. As for the side of onion rings- they were huge! The onions were soft, but not flavorful. The batter was crunchy, but this also lacked flavor. I probably won't order onion rings here again.  The kahlua grilled cheese had a juicy serving of pulled pork in between stretchy layers of yellow cheddar and muenster. The sour dough bread was buttery and toasted well. I really enjoyed each bite of this - the cheese was gooey, the pork had umami, and the bread was crispy. My only complaint was that it felt a little greasy on my tongue.   My favorite part of the meal was the side of red velvet pancakes. As pictured, there is a dollop of whipped cream on top (waitress asked if I wanted more whipped cream so you can do that too, free of charge). Crumbled chocolate oreo cookies are sprinkled on the whipped cream, and in a small container is some cream cheese syrup. These red velvet pancakes were chewy, fluffy, and slightly doughy in the middle. They actually taste like red velvet, and the batter isn't overwhelmingly sweet like some other places. The bright red was so aesthetically pleasing that I felt bad eating the pancakes lol.   Overall, Babystacks is a family-friendly breakfast food chain that offers multiple types of food and good service. I wouldn't get the onion rings because they aren't too flavorful. I highly recommend getting the red velvet pancakes (cliche for a reason)! If you are craving something savory and heavier, the kahlua grilled cheese and chili loco moco are good options.",

I work in the industry so I understand but at the very least you should let your guests know it's going to take a long time for their food to come out. The food was good and the host at the front was really kind but that is not how the situation should of been handled. Let your guests know ASAP of the situation and keep them updated. If it were my establishment I would of offered guests a free entree or a % off for the major inconvenience. Sucks I probably won't go back. Such a simple mistake could of been avoided.",

We usually come after 7am cause we knew it gets busy. Not to our surprise it was. Anyhow, there was a party of 12 or more and their whole party wasn't even present so it held back customers who were all their in time. Not to mention they have a sign that says all parties have to be present. Well, their sign doesnt mean anything cause hostess still waited on the party and kept asking them when are the others coming so one of the family members called and said they are parking..yet it took 10 minutes for them to arrive. My fam n I been a loyal customer cause we love their food. Anyhow,  I think I'll stick to coming in when they first open to avoid things like this. They need to truly stick to their signs. Happy eats!",

Today, I ordered the tocino pork belly they gave 4 small pieces of meat with rice and eggs.  I would say that it was delicious but the problem is the portions are very small for the $12.95 price that they are asking.  I told our waitress and she said that other people feel the same way about the portions and price ratio.  I usually give 5 stars but given small portion and price I downgraded to 2 stars. I told both the waitress and the cashier, but it appears, they don't have a manager to deal with this complaint.",

In a sort of run down strip mall and all the signs (on Xerox paper with highlighter) plastered all over their doors and hostess table are very off putting. The signs pretty much say one of two things: they will not seat parties until the entire party arrives and they will not split checks. I don't really have a problem with the first (lots of places only seat entire parties) it is more the way they convey the message. Just kind of rude/bossy. But the no splitting checks thing just baffles me. I can't remember the last time (ever?!) I've been to a place that won't do it.   The menu is huge. So many different types of pancakes! Every flavor under the sun. They have savory items too, but really the pancake choices seem like what 9/10 people order. Normally I am not a huge sweet breakfast fan. I much prefer savory, but, when in Rome...   So I got the short stack of Red Velvet pancakes with chocolate crumbles and cream cheese syrup. Definitely could qualify as dessert more than breakfast! The pancakes were very good! Fluffy and had a great red velvet flavor. Surprisingly, I enjoyed them more than I expected. I couldn't even finish the short stack though because they were pretty rich.   Service was fine. Nothing bad, but nothing memorable either.   I think just maybe classing up the way they convey their (kind of annoying) policies could bump them up to 4 stars for me. A little more polish could go a long way.",

My man was surprised I smoothed my plate way before him given that I'm normally the slow eater. I may have been just super hungry that morning and that's why I was so glad I ordered the German Chocolate Babystacks as included in my order. It's chocolate pancake smothered with coconut flakes with drizzles of pecan and caramel AND chocolate syrup. I was in love in an instant! I got to try the red velvet as well.

I know the world is a rough place  at it's nice to get served by folks that know they are in a hospitality trade  The place wasn't packed at all but it took a long time for the coffee to arrive. My benedict arrived Luke warm. The potatoes were scraps which was dissapointing. The server was good - a decent fellow. Also they have televisions playing which I personally find horrendous but that's just me. Anyone who is free from the filth that is television knows how awful it is to be around them.",

We drove away from the strip to eat before we went to the Rise Festival - definitely had this place in mind because we were thinking \"big breakfast\" before spending hours in the Mojave dessert. It seems to be the local's favorites and outsiders (like myself) have come to take over and create longer lines.   LOLA CORA'S CORNED BEEF HASH AND EGGS - served with your choice of the following: (2) buttermilk babystacks or toast and steamed rice or potatoes, and eggs of your choice. Upgrade to garlic rice $1, Upgrade to your favorite babystack (extra charge). I tried to upgrade to their special that had rick's adobo fried rice but was declined and therefore I settled for garlic fried rice. MUST upgrade the buttermilk babystacks to RED VELVET. The corned beef hash is house made, not greasy, and had a nice corn beef flavor without it being too salty. It's hard to write a review about cornbeef and garlic fried rice.  Sorry, I'm not posting my pictures... it was challenging to take a pretty picture of corned beef hash.   Until the next bite....",

AHHHH!!!! *DROOL* I am so glad they are not close to my house because I'd easily be there everyday.  We also ordered coffee, orange juice, and chose to share the BYO skillet with Portuguese sausage, mushroom, spinach, pepper jack cheese, and scrambled eggs. The eggs were super fluffy with a delicious garlic flavor. The plate also came with side of sourdough toast all buttered up.  MMmmmmmm... We will definitely be back when we're in the area!",

Got the Cowboy skillet and subbed the ham for turkey sausage and the TLC pancakes (toffee and caramel pancakes), the weekend special. The skillet was a big portion, and tasted like you would expect but nothing very special - delicious cheesy potatoes and egg. Can't really go wrong with that. The real star of the menu are their pancakes. They're soft, fluffy, and come decked out with a bunch of toppings. I also had some of my friends tiramisu pancakes, another weekend special, that had coffee batter and mascarpone whipped cream, and the red velvet pancakes, which would be a good choice if you like really rich and sweet breakfasts. Overall, a very good value for your money!",

Here are my thoughts on Baby Stacks:  The Good: Holy moly, their breakfast was so good!! They specialize in pancakes, of course. They have a wide variety of just about everything you can think of to mix in to pancake batter. In fact, there were a few specials of pancakes that weren't even on the menu.   I had an egg white omelet with a side of rice instead of hash browns. In addition, I ordered a mini side of chocolate chip pancakes. SO GOOD!  The Bad: It's hard to eat healthy in this type of breakfast place. Most all of the pancakes and breakfast items are for sure going to be high in calories. But, sometimes you have to treat yourself every once in a while.   Oh, also their tables are a bit small for their plate sizes. Other than that, Baby Stacks was great!",

    "text": "About 15 minute drive from the strip.  it was a full house during breakfast/brunch time (weekend).  Be prepared to wait.  When we left at about 2pm - there was no wait.   Tip:  Look at menu & also the specials on the board while waiting. Then when you're seated..BAM - you're ready to order. Efficiency! Time is of the essence in Vegas :)                                            THE SCOOP:  KAHLUA PORK EGGS BENEDICT:  pork was tender and seasoned well.  Not too salty, which is a PLUS in my book.  I asked for hollandaise sauce ON THE SIDE.  You might want to request this too.  B/c once you break the egg yolk it can get pretty rich & heavy.  And if your benedict is drenched in hollandaise sauce too...idk!  Can you say heartburn?  This dish was pretty good.   PORTUGUESE SAUSAGE w/ garlic rice & eggs PLUS your choice pancakes (2 cakes).  This dish is simple, but AWESOME. The garlic rice is good & homey, but NOT ENOUGH (portion size is about 1/2 bowl of rice).  Us Asians like our rice.  Sausage was tasty and plenty.  As for the pancake - i ordered Banana cream Pie.  A bit bland and dull for me.  Like all some of the other reviews say - if you like Banana cream pie...you would like this. However, it was BLAH.  I even ordered CREAM CHEESE syrup on the side.  The syrup wasn't as good as I envisioned it to be.  Tasted more like a sugar glaze w/ a hint of cream cheese.    ADOBO FRIED RICE: Egg omlette w/ pork adobo rice inside. Sounded pretty unique...had to get it (to go).  It was good, but nothing too special.  Meat was tender and well marinated. i would go w/ the Portuguese sausage combo dish rather than this.   SERVICE: friendly waiter.  Food took a LONG time to come out.   Overall, I liked the food and the wide selection on the menu.  I LOVE the idea of  Hawaiian/Filipino mixed with american breakfast.  What a great FUSION CONCEPT :)",

    "text": "Loved this place.  Best food we had in Las Vegas this trip, hands down.  I had the basic breakfast with bacon and eggs, and upgraded the pancakes to the german chocolate.  I don't normally care much for pancakes, but these were fantastic, better than some german chocolate cakes that i've eaten.  Highly recommended!  My dining companion had the lemon ricotta crepes, and the lemon sauce was really, really good.    We liked Baby Stacks so much, we came back our last day on the way to the airport.  Rather, we detoured to get here, since it was in the opposite direction.  Great food, you can't go wrong.",

Depends on your expectations haha   All in all decent, not sure I would go out of my way to come here again though",

The second cafe is bigger than the first and there was no wait, but I'm sure that won't last long once word gets out that the new joint has arrived.  I'm happy to report that we received the same great customer service and the same delicious food.  My regular order of Cinnabun pancakes, scrambled eggs, and hash browns arrived at our table in no time at all.  Bob Marley was blasting as I savored each delicious bite--what more can a Yelping gal like me ask for except...more?  Keep it up, BabyStacks crew and mahalo!",

The pancakes were fluffy and ever so lightly crispy on the edges. Had a very light but distinct cocoa/ vanilla flavor. Comes with a side of condensed milk like sauce instead of syrup.  Adobo fried rice was interesting with the egg wrapper.  The fried rice was very good .. not too greasy but did feel the egg flavor was a bit overwhelming. It was done well, too  -- but maybe one less egg yolk would've done it a world of good. =)  They also have other interesting items like s'more pancakes, banana cream pie pancake, etc etc",

Plenty of parking is available, and the cafe seems to be pretty busy on the weekends.   When we arrived around 11 on Sunday, we were told it would be up to 45 minutes before we could be seated. Lucky for us, the wait turned out to be only half an hour.   The specialty here is clearly pancakes, red velvet, orange Creamsicle, pumpkin, strawberry and all the usual suspects are on the menu. I had the pumpkin pancakes which were served with whipped cream and cream cheese \"dressing.\"  Although yummy, my pancakes were a bit dry, the waitress offered to bring something else, but I was almost done with my meal at that point. Overall, the service is friendly and the food was good I would recommend this place.",

Came in with a couple of friends and the place was pretty busy. I didn't know that this location existed, but we were quickly seated. They have alot of the traditional breakfast fare, but they also have a bunch of hawaiian/asian food options as well.  We checked out of course what everyone gets: the red velvet pancakes! and the white chocolate macadamia pancakes! These things are more of a dessert rather than a actual dish, pure sugary sweetness. I liked the white chocolate ones but my friends thought they were waaay to sweet. But I think they jus have poor taste. the Red Velvet ones were exactly that, red dyed pancakes, with a interesting cream cheese syrup which sounded out but worked out well. I liked the red velvet, they were good, but I don't think they live up to the immense hype that I heard of.  We also ordered another dish, I think Huevos Rancheros or something, but it was obviously forgettable. To be honest, the place is my opinion is good, but it's not as amazing as everyone else makes to seem. The red velvet pancakes are good, and I liked the food, but there are much better breakfast places in town. I would return and I am not opposed to eating here, but its not something I am gonna get excited over either.",

Everything was hot & very good. I think I am giving it four stars because I had heard so much hype, maybe my expectations were too high. The service was good. My family (4 people) all ordered the same with variations on the omelette & pancake flavors. The bill with tip was $71.00. I tasted my daughter's red velvet pancakes & that were delicious. My husband had the blueberry which were more on the traditional side. Overall a good experience & we'll go back. Just wish it hadn't been talked up so much!

Also my husband ordered over easy eggs but one of them was just really uncooked. It had all the clear goo stuff coming out. It was kind of gross. She apologized and gave us another one.",

    "text": "If you plan on coming here, don't arrive an hour before they close. The servers don't seem to care at all if you're waiting to be greeted, what I would like to drink, and most of all... take my order and get my order right. I waited nearly over 20 mins. to get my drink order then I literally had to stand up and see all the servers hanging around the cashier laughing and not giving a damn. I said *out loud.. Can I pleeeeease order? The next reaction just stunned me. All three just looked away and looked down as if they were checking their phones and counting money?!??? Seriously??? After one server was finished with whatever bs she was doing, she walked up to my table like nothing and asked me what I want to get. At this moment, I'm already disgusted by the service here. I told Felisha, my server a short stack of Macadamia Nut and Carrot Cakes.. also Portuguese sausage and eggs.. for an extra charge, I substituted with egg whites. From how things are going, I also asked for two to go boxes, because I wasn't going to stay much longer. Waiting is Riiiiidiculous here.  My pancakes came and unfortunately both were tasteless and dry even with all that syrup and cream cheese toppings. Then my server brings the egg whites separate and the Portuguese sausage separate.. I'm like.. you have to be kidding me right?!! Does she not know I came here before and order this very dish to know she messed up on my order. Since she never came around after dropping off my food I waved down to catch another server/busser? and asked him... doesn't the Portuguese sausage and eggs come with hash browns??? He looked so puzzled and slowly said yes..... yes \"wait\" a minute. Then another five minutes later my server comes by and said oh I thought you wanted them separate. I told her no I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs entree. It does come with hash browns right? She goes.. yes here you go and was about to turn around and walk away... Not so fast... I told her.. Excuse me... she turned around and I go, since I ordered the entree.. it includes a side of pancakes doesn't it?? She goes.. yes it does. I look at her and she looks at me like yea so?!? I told her.... Soooo am I going to get a side of pancakes or ??? She goes well what kind you want? I'm like whatever kind comes with this entree. She goes well we have buttermilk or for an extra charge red velvet. I told her I just want what comes with the entree. If I didn't say anything, she wasn't even going to bother correcting my order and think I haven't dined here.. more so think I don't know what this entree includes. Not that slick sweetheart. I'm going to get what I'm paying for not half ass. That right there was wrongly done. Not nice to treat a repeat guest or any guest for that matter. The hash brown was semi-cooked, portuguese sausage was over cooked and extremely dry like burned wood chips. The only thing that came out good out of this experience was the eggs whites. I can't believe the service here and the worst part is it WASN'T even busy at all. Unacceptable.  Thank goodness I asked for my to go boxes, it came in handy and again, I had to ask a different server/cashier if I can get a container cover for the syrup and cream cheese. This place should be called Long Wait that Stacks Up, because obviously that's all I experienced here. And of course the sneaky server Felisha that tried to get away in not offering me the pancakes that came with the meal. Lazy. Even though it's the last hour, you should always treat the guest as if they are your first, middle, or last. They are still your guest!!!",

But hey, it was a Sunday and anywhere breakfast spot it going to be busy.    I ordered the macadamia nut white chocolate pancakes and a side of bacon.  The pancakes come in a reg stack which is 6 or a short stack which is 3.  The three is plenty for me and I usually can only eat two. The pancakes are full of macadamia nuts and sprinkled with mini white choco chips.The side of bacon is three nice, crispy, thick pieces that aren't greasy.  Just thinking about this is making for hungry.  My bf ordered the red Velvet pancakes the first time we went and they were pretty good.  He loved them, but I'm not the biggest fan of red velvet.  This time around he ordered the corn beef hash, which hash browns, and he upgraded his pancakes to the Almond Joy ones.  Man those pancakes were so yummy.  Chocolate pancakes with a ton of coconut in them.  Who wouldn't love those?  The service is always friendly, the food comes out pretty quick despite them being always busy, and I can't wait till our next trip to Vegas so I can eat some yummy pancakes.",

The sandwich had no flavor. I attempted to add flavor by adding ketchup to the first half which was gross and then I added Cholula to the second half which was also gross. Maybe, I'm ignorant to the style of cooking Kalua Pig, but it just tasted like plain meat. The Cinnabun pancakes were served with some icing drizzled and crumbled pecans on top, but there was so cinnamon. I guess I was expecting a cinnamon roll in pancake form. I did get a taste of the S'mores pancakes and those were really good. I suppose I would have to visit again and try another item on their menu.",

On my first Friday at work I wanted to treat myself to a big breakfast and chow down but I could only come up w/IHOP. But here is what I've been looking for. I had the short stack of their best selling red velvet, Ranchero chili chicken omelet w/hash. The pancake had a nice crisp on the outside w/a nice fluffy interior and very good chocolaty flavor. All the the whip cream and cream cheese  syrup complimented it very well. My wife had the baby chix skillet w/fresh veggies and a nice garlic flavor. They also have a filipino/Hawaiian option which is a plus when I entertain guests since that's what they like.",

    "text": "Listen to your YELP friends, people. This place is good for one thing and one thing only: PANCAKES.   My girlfriend and I got here after waking up late on Sunday morning with an epic sweet tooth. She was craving chocolate cake so I figured this would be a great spot.   It was semi crowded by the time we got there. They told us it would be about 15 minutes, but we were given the option of sitting at the dining counter within 5 minutes. We aren't picky, so we took it! (One star here for under-promising and over-achieving. BabyStacks does a good job of over estimating wait times and then having you seated before your estimated wait time expires. This is great, in my opinion. Nothing bugs me more than being told 15 minutes and waiting 40.)   Ashley ordered the red velvet pancakes. She knew what she was getting before we even got there. I ordered the eggs and bacon with white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes ($1 upcharge for their specialty pancakes - well worth it).   Let me say this: the rest of their breakfast foods aren't all that great. The bacon actually didn't taste very good and the eggs were nothing special. The only reason I ordered them was because I figured I should get some protein in me. However, in all honesty, if you're coming here, you should be coming for pancakes and not expect much else. The home fries or breakfast potatoes were also pretty bland, as if they came from a frozen bag.   However, I'm still going to give 5 stars because I have never tasted better pancakes in my life. Ashley's red velvet pancakes came with cream cheese type syrup. They were UNBELIEVABLY MELT IN YOUR MOUTH DELICIOUS. My white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were also good - not as good as hers - but still very soft, delicious, and with white chocolate morsels that were half melted into the pancakes. MMMM.   So, seriously guys, when a restaurant names themselves after PANCAKES and specialize in PANCAKES, don't order something other than PANCAKES.   :)",

The omelet was pretty good, not great but not bad. The seasoned potato's turned out to be small pieces of deep fried steak fries, absolutely no seasoning. I got four halves of toast with just enough butter that I could barely see it with my reading glasses on. Don't expect any jelly or honey for it, \"they\" don't offer it. Last, the coffee was not bad just only warm when they first brought it out. I was not impressed, just amazed that they can stay in business. There are many much better places to go for breakfast people. Try them. Needless to say my first trip is also my last trip.",

Baby Stacks caught my attention since it's close to my house and have good ratings. This is a small joint and when we came here, it was packed. We had to wait for 20 minutes to get seated.   There were so many options on their menu (Hawaiian and Filipino cuisine too) and they all sounded so good. I ordered Cora's Corned Beef Hash with garlic rice and a side of Banana Cream Pie pancake. My bf ordered a full size Banana Cream Pie pancake (ordered this since we saw a lot of people raving about it) with Portuguese sausage on the side.   Corned beef hash was good but the garlic rice was a disappointment. It had more onions than garlic. I hardly tasted any garlic in it. My banana cream pie pancake was good at first until I came across some uncooked batter at the bottom.   My bf didn't like the banana cream pie pancake since it was too dense for him. We both like fluffy pancakes. The Portuguese sausage was very good but it tasted like the ones we buy packed at the grocery store. It was not made in-house.  Maybe next time we will try something else if we ever come back.",

    "text": "Yess! My favorite breakfast place is now on the south side of town making it easier for those who don't want to travel all that way up to the northwest. This location is a bit bigger than the original, but of course all the food especially the pancakes still taste the same. I've been here on 2 visits and my most recent I ordered something other than my usual selections of kalua pig benedict and red velvet pancakes. They had a dry erase board with new menu selections and it had things like kalua pig grilled cheese and breakfast sliders. Both sounded delish, but after reading the description of the breakfast sliders it seemed like it was something I could make on my own making me choose the kalua pig grilled cheese! Loved every bite of it because it had a good amount of pork in there and meshed well with all the cheesey goodness. I've heard from friends and from my own personal experience that the other pancake options cannot compare to the red velvet, does anyone know of another pancake they offer that is just as spectacular?  P.S. they over estimate the wait time because on several occasions I have been seated sooner than the original time they told me.",

I have tried the red velvet, lemon ricotta, banana foster, and banana cream pie so far. I like them all! If you are looking for something less sweet, I would recommend the banana cream pie and the lemon ricotta pancakes.   Enjoy! ( I sure do)",

    "text": "HYPE? Yes. WORTH TRYING? Yes. COMING BACK? Hell Yes.  RED VELVET PANCAKES: Don't lie. You know of Babystacks because they're home to the red velvet pancakes. And red velvet is hipster. But that's ok, that's why I came here too. I'm not a lover of pancakes,  but I am a lover of these. They're tastier than regular pancakes and topped with a house-whipped whipped cream and chocolate chips. And who can complain about a cream cheese \"syrup\"? Its painfully sweet, but in a good way. Order it alongside some savory items and you will have the perfect meal to please your palette. Get a full-stack if your hungry, short stack if you wanna nibble.  KAHLUA PIG BENEDICT: I love me some eggs benedict. And when its mixed up with some creativity I'm all for it. This was pretty good. Not great! But I was happy with how it tasted. The shredded pork and cabbage mixture could've used a little more flavor though. Spices are your friend Babycakes... Cheese and Egg yolk alone cannot flavor up a whole dish. I finished the leftovers the following morning. It tasted even better to-go once the flavors had settled and melded together!  VARIETY: The menu is quite large. All the usual breakfast combos and classics like loco moco are orderable. So many dishes look so delectable!  I'm very particular about paying mark-ups for breakfast food. But this time, the restaurant lived up to the hype. This new Spring Valley location isn't too far from my house so I'll be back!",

They called our name before the 25-30 minutes were up. We were still at Walgreens. But, when we showed up they sat us as soon as possible and it was very quick. My daughter got the banana pancake kids meal and I got a Hawaiian  chili omelette with red velvet pancakes. I have to say the red velvet pancakes are not overrated! I am not big on sweets and I couldn't get enough of them! I did get extra cream cheese sauce and they do charge you for it, but it was so worth it. It was so delicious! My daughters banana pancakes were very tasty as well.   The omelette was good, too. But, I do believe the pancakes are the way to go. So yummy! Service was good, even though they were busy. There were a few mistakes, but they were rectified promptly. Will definitely return! It was one of the best breakfast I've ever had.",

It turned out to be more like 50 min & we were there later -- maybe around noon. The waitress was cold and to the point. There was no \"where you guys from\" or anything like that. I had the banana foster pancakes (not listed on their menu). It was an upgrade to the 2 egg breakfast with potatoes. Two pancakes with cinnamon & caramel sauce and bananas. I asked for no whip cream. The pancakes were good. The other people at my table didn't like theirs as much (red velvet & s'mores -- was dry). If you're ok with the wait, then maybe visit them.",

I actually prefer to go alone because it's easier to get a chair at the bar type area than wait for a table.    I will say though that the times I have gone with a group, more specifically - my daughter in a wheelchair - the service was great.  I am so appreciative of their wanting to ensure her comfort level & actually acknowledging her existence vs. giving strange looks & talking to me about her in front of her (happens at other restaurants all the time).  The servers are wonderful. Seriously.  As for the food - oh.em.gee.  I have sampled almost every pancake flavor they have & I can't think of a single negative thing to say.  The friends & family I have taken with me who have tried other dishes were just as satisfied by what they had.    The prices are great, the food is amazing, the service is great...the wait sucks but hey, at least they're busy enough to stay open so I can keep going back!  If there was any suggestion I could give - it's to find a way to have a shaded area outside the building where people can sit/stand while they wait for a table.  The accessibility of the restaurant is often compromised because of the people standing around blocking several areas.",

I like the menu options with the standard breakfast fare and a large selection of Hawaiian fusion breakfast items like the adobo omelette, loco moco, spam omelette, kahlua pig eggs benedict, and portuguese sausage.  They also have a large variety of pancake options, all which are cooked perfectly.  Babystacks has breakfast food down to a tee....I've tried both the adobo omelette and loco moco and I'm a fan of both!   So if you are ever in need of a good brunch place, this is a must try type of establishment...and don't forget to order the FULL stack of the red velvet pancakes...it's like the Lay's potato chip slogan, betcha can't eat just one!...so probably best to order extra so you can share.",

Al dente, hard on the exterior like its been sitting out too long and not appetizing at all.  Get potatoes. You're better off.  As for the rest of the food, I had a spam scramble - not enough furikake. Pancakes were good and fluffy.  Please just fix the rice!!! Trust me it's gross.",

    "text": "Stopped in at about 7:15 on Saturday morning, after a ridiculous lack of sleep, and my darling husband saying, very suggestively in my ear at 6:45 am:  \"I WANT PANCAKES!!!!\"  I'd heard great things about Baby Stacks, and I really liked the place.  It was pretty empty when we arrived, but quickly filled up as more reasonable people started waking up and coming out for breakfast.    We ordered: The veggie skillet:  2 eggs (I ordered mine over medium), cubed potato, spinach, peppers, onions, and tomato.  I upgraded my short stack to the hazelnut pancakes (instead of plain buttermilk)  The country fried steak with hashbrowns and bacon pancakes.   A word about portions: Really smart here.  The skillet was the perfect size.  I was able to eat all of it, AND most of my pancakes without feeling stuffed, or overly full.  Fella's portion was a bit bigger, and he had a little trouble finishing all of his food, but he was a trooper.   The food is REALLY good here.   As with most breakfast places I've eaten at here, the food is NOT aggressively seasoned.  I had to add a bit of salt and pepper to my skillet.  Not a big deal.  I'd rather have to add some than have the food be too salty to eat.  The eggs were PERFECT.  Firm whites, runny yolk...I'm drooling a little remembering how amazing it is.    The hazelnut pancakes were great too..although they were a tiny bit dry,  but I find that most pancakes are unless I drown them in butter and syrup.  These were full of flavor though, and the dryness went away with the whipped cream.   Fella's food was great too.  I tasted everything. ;)  all in all, it was a great visit!  The service was excellent, and they had reggae music playing, which is also a win for us.    We will most definitely be back!!",

I had the PB and chocolate pancakes.  I will say they were tasty but the peanut butter flavor was not very strong.  They tasted more like regular buttermilk pancakes.  But I did enjoy them.   My mom was hoping they would have waffles but settled on French toast instead.  She had the honey French toast.  She said it was pretty good and a big serving.  She also got a side of bacon which only had two pieces on it.  She would have liked 3 or 4 pieces which is what you usually get on a side order.  Overall this place was good.  Definitely a good pancake house if you are craving that.",

    "text": "What a great way to end our Las Vegas weekend!   Some friends of ours decided to take us to \"Babystacks\" before we departed LV Sunday afternoon, I'm so glad they did! I've actually NEVER heard of Babystacks till that day but now I might actually make a pit stop whenever I'm in town! Babystacks as you've probably guessed is primarily known for their variety of pancake options.. I'm not much of a pancake fan so I opted for one of their signature dishes \"Chili Loco Moco\" along with a side of small order of macadamia nut pancakes to try. A friend of ours is an LV local and she suggested we order the Chilo Loco Moco with the adobe fried rice substitute so we can try 2 signature dishes into 1. Hence, our order was \"Can we have the chili loco moco but instead substitute the regular rice with adobe fried rice, hold on the onions, replace the burger patty with kalua pork, and also upgrade the side to a macadamia nut pancake?\" The waitress (so sorry I didn't catch your name) looked at me in shock and said \"Hold on, let me see if we can do that for you\" and came back 10 seconds later with a thumbs up! I was so happy they were able to accommodate to our complicated order LOL.   It took awhile for our food to come (25 minutes or so), my assumption is because of our complicated order haha. When our food finally arrived, I was surprised to see the GENEROUS portions! As in, the food was falling off the plate because it was THAT MUCH! I'm so glad we sub'ed the regular rice with adobe fried rice because it definitely added some texture/flavor. I'm also a sauce person and the loco moco gravy was heavenly. The kalua pork was perfectly shredded and flavorful, at a heaping generous portion as well. Subbing the side dish with the macadamia nut pancake is highly recommended because we were able to try what the pancakes are all about! It was a bit overcooked (stale and dry) but otherwise sweet and delicious. Even with both my boyfriend and I sharing, was more than enough because we still had left overs to go! I'm so glad we were able to try Babystacks because I will definitely be back!   Tip: Restaurant closes at 2pm on the weekdays and 3pm on weekends so plan accordingly!",

There is a large selection of pancakes to choose from; red velvet, cookies and cream, orange creamsicle, and s'mores are just some of the many choices you have. If you want even more food (which I always surrender myself to), you can order the entrees that include the pancakes of your choice. I've had the adobo fried rice omelet (holy moly it's big), spam fried rice with garlic, and chili moco. Everything on the menu is so much like Hawaiian style food, so you definitely get Hawaiian vibes when you dine here. There are three locations, and I've been to all of them. Service is usually consistent. Make sure to come when they first open, because the restaurants can get crowded.",

There are a couple other good places to check out in this little strip mall area including 'Komex' and 'Off The Hook'.  Service and food are consistent between here and the two other locations I have been in. It is a Filipino-Hawaiian influenced cafe. I noticed the big set of wooden knife, spoon, and fork hanging on the wall (a favorite wall hanging in many Filipino homes).   My favorite is Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice platter. I usually add one of their signature pancakes (usually the red velvet pancakes). I have sat at their dining bar when I am alone as well as at a table with family/friends. Staff is always friendly and efficient. Food comes out in a timely manner. Wait time can vary depending on time of day. We have waited as long as 20 minutes. (Please note, when you reserve a table, your entire party must be present in order to be seated).  The place is usually busy no matter which location I have gone to but wait times have been tolerable or move quickly. All in all, a great place to have breakfast/brunch whether ny yourself or with friends/family.",

The seasoned chicken with mushroom, spinach and runny OM egg topped with my substitution of pepper jack cheese was a good choice.  It was on the high end of garlicness but that wasn't a negative.  I was even more amazed at the red velvet pancakes!  Light and fluffy topped with chocolate crumbles and whipped cream.  Pour the cream cheese syrup on top and it's like eating a cake!  Definitely a must try there!  We also had a friendly server who took good care of us.  I would return the next time I'm in Vegas.",

    "text": "Actual rating 3.5.  The best advice to Vegas on a budget is to eat off-Strip if you can. Not only does eating out become much more reasonable, you would be surprised of the variety of options. Considering that most locals avoid the Strip if at all possible, some of the real hidden gems can be found.  To a lot of locals, this restaurant is one of those gems. Most plates are less than $10/order, which is unheard of on the Strip. Not only that by eating here the plates can feed you for at least half the day. While there are no reservations and everyone in your party must be present, if you can wait 30 minutes to an hour, the meal would be worth it.  The menu features quite a bit of Hawaiian and Filipino plates, so when eating here try one of the plates and upgrade to a short stack of pancakes if you can. My order consisted of the homemade corned beef hash and eggs over medium ($10.95) with an upgrade to garlic fried rice ($1.00) and red velvet pancakes.  - The corned beef is similar in texture to the corned beef found in the square American cans which are commonly given as gifts when people visit the Philippines on vacation. Personally I like the Australian corned beef found in the bigger round cans, but this is hard to come by and only one restaurant I know served it like that. Still delicious. - Garlic fried rice has an interesting note - \"contains onions\". I can taste more onion powder than I can the garlic. Also still good.  Pancakes are good, but I was more impressed by sight than taste. The pancakes look quite fluffy and I like the toppings, but the pancakes just by themselves are plain with a slightly bitter aftertaste due to having too much baking powder. The toppings really do make the pancake taste a lot better, which was the case with the red velvet (cream cheese) and the hazelnut (Nutella).  My family likes to go here for breakfast because you can get full here for the same price as eating out at IHOP or a little more than Denny's. Despite some of my minor issues I would still recommend eating here as you get good value for your money.",

In addition to their huge selection of breakfast items, they also serve lunch and other entrees. My favorite is the spam and eggs served with garlic rice. It's simple to make, but let's be honest, I don't cook often. I would highly recommend this dish if you're looking for something not too heavy. It also comes with a side of shortstack pancakes of your choice!   The prices aren't cheap here, but the portions are generous. Ample parking outside. And the service has been wonderful every time I've dined here.",

We ordered the adobo fried rice, chili moco (chili version of loco moco, carrot cake pancakes, macadamia nut pancakes, cookie butter French toast and Kailua pork Benedict. The adobo fried was good and a decent portion. The ingredients in the chili moco went well with each other but the chili tasted a bit cold. The carrot cake tasted better than the macadamia nut pancakes. There were carrot in the carrot cake pancakes. The macadamia pancakes were just regular pancakes with the syrup and white chips on top. The cookie butter French toast was ok. I felt like it needed something else. The Kailua pork Benedict was good and the pork was moist.",

My hubby, who's not really a fan of banana flavors even ended up sharing my pancakes over his white chocolate one. Definitely worth going back, but I may try a different rice dish or bring some kind of chutney or Sriracha to pair with the adobo fried rice omelet next time.",

They serve delicious pancake varieties from red velvet to macadamia and white chocolate but what we usually get is their chicken fried steak with perfectly cooked eggs and the loco moco. BabyStacks serves Filipino-Hawaiian style food alongside traditional American favorites, but if you're feeling adventurous why not try their Filipino-inspired \"Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice\", made with traditional Filipino Adobo consisting of marinated shredded chicken, fried rice, green onion garnish, all wrapped up in omelette style eggs! It's a local favorite that you shouldn't miss!",

I'm not sure if this was supposed to be a Hawaiian food cafe, or they just happened to serve Hawaiian food, but it definitely didn't taste like the food from back home. The Portuguese sausage tasted more like hot dogs, the adobo fried rice that my friend had wasn't vinegar-y at all. My boyfriend who had the kalua pig Benedict liked his food, but other than that, it was alright. I needed to add pepper, salt and ketchup to my hash browns, because it had no taste. The banana pancakes were just pancakes with slices of bananas on it, nothing special.   I probably wouldn't eat here again. I feel bad for writing such a sad review, but this is just my opinion.",

    "text": "Locals-type diner for some Hawaiian fare, but mostly for pancakes that are a bit on the sweet side.  To be quite honest, IHOP fare might be comparable.  People really like Babystacks, though.  Business seems good here.  The room was full.  The Red Velvet short stack was comprised of three extremely red pancakes.  Rather heavy-handed in the food colouring, even for RV.  Cream cheese syrup goes very nicely with them.  The combo tastes exactly like a Red Velvet Cake.  It was pretty good, light and fluffy... if a bit on the dry side for a pancake.  I prefer hotcakes with more butter or moisture in them.  Babystacks offers interesting variety of pancake flavours, including Carrot Cake.  Loco Moco was tasty.  Poached eggs, cooked medium, were still runny enough over the meat patty and scoops of rice.  Portions could be bigger.  Prices are low.  Service was alright.  Restroom was clean.  I really wanted to like Babystacks a lot more, but it was just okay.  Maybe stop in if you happen to be in the neighborhood, but I wouldn't necessarily make a special trip.",

It is our go to breakfast place. We come the first day in Vegas and right before we leave. There is nothing like babystacks in Cali. So now you know why we always come. Not only do  We bring family and friends, but tell the others to come when in vegas and the are always make sure to stop by when in vegas. Not only is the food amazing but the service is great. All the staff is super nice and attentive. Today we had Amanda as our server. She was great super friendly! The food: OMG AMAZING. The pancakes are bomb love the flavors and choices. The mocha chocolate chip bomb glad its on the full menu, red velvet bomb, carrot cake bomb, peanut butter and jelly bomb, cookies and cream bomb lets just say all of them are BOMB haven't had any that were not. the omelettes: the Mexican is the best as well as the cowboy. Who would have thought to put carnitas in an omelet? Babystacks that's who. If you haven't been here STOP BY! trust me won't be disappointed!",

We had an issue with the hostess since she ignored us and didn't even greet us. We waited for awhile until I stopped a server and she was professional and greeted us. Then when I went to pay for our bill, hostess left after she saw me walking towards her. Instead she took someone who just walked in the door while I was standing before her. Edgar alleged that he is the manager and was really rude towards us. He kept saying he will address it and basically just rush us out the door while Elsie (unsure of spelling) the hostess was smirking and smiling. I even told Edgar. Wow. Really? I hope he is not the manager because he clearly didn't care. I rather go somewhere else with better service.",

The food is tasty. Low table tops so expect a wait, especially on the weekends. But there is another location, just sound on Decatur about 10-15 minutes from this Smoke Ranch location on Flamingo & Decatur.   I did have a squab with the hostess one day, but whatever - didn't like her, still don't like to see her there, but it is something I can overcome just as long as she doesn't include in any part of my service. - tip RUDE Hostess. Without the customers, you wouldn't be employed.   The servers are always attentive and great.   ONE Suggestion would be that they should be some local coffee to go with the morning grind!  Love this place. Can't compliment it enough.   Try everything its great and don't be shy about asking to sub something out that you don't like. They're pretty good at accommodating.",

I have been countless times and have never left unsatisfied.   The signature Red Velvet pancakes will bring more meaning to your life. They come out sprinkled with a chocolate crumble, slightly melted whip cream and a side of cream cheese syrup.  You may think the short stack won't be enough, but it is PLENTY.  Only order the full if you plan on sharing (prices are more than reasonable btw.)   The Lemon Crepes, and the smore's pancakes are a couple others I've tried.  If you're indecisive, this place might stress you out but just know -- everything is delicious.  I usually order seasoned potatoes to go with the sweet portion of the meal, because you can't have sweet without salty :P   The service is always bomb too and the place has never felt dirty.   If they added a brunch Mimosa special -- I would probably be there every weekend (and weigh 20 lbs more.)",

I highly recommend their \"Huntington\" omelette upgrading your sides with their \"Cinnabun\" pancakes.  SO GOOOOD!  Will be back again for more, thanks gang!",

    "text": "Me, my husband, and my father showed up here on Christmas Eve for some delicious pancakes. We wanted to take my dad out to breakfast, but since we're not from Vegas and he's only lived in Summerlin for a couple years, we turned to Yelp for help. And of course it did no disappoint.   We started at the original location, but the line was crazy long so we drove down the street to this location. There was still a wait, but we offered to sit at the counter so we were seated immediately. And our service was great, BTW. Sometimes the counter gets forgotten, but we never were.  I ordered the bacon and avocado skillet with a side of red velvet pancakes. My husband ordered the carnitas skillets with a side of lemon ricotta pancakes. And my dad ordered the carrot cake pancakes and a side of potatoes. We were all blown away with how delicious everything was! My skillet was perfect and those red velvet pancakes -- well, you can read all about them in the numerous other reviews. Let me just say, they were everything they were cracked up to be. I think I actually prefer red velvet pancakes to red velvet cake now. That's right, I said it. Oh, and their salsa is all homemade and delicious!  The winner of the morning, however, was the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were more like crepes and they were absolutely PERFECT. So light and fresh. We couldn't stop talking about them, or the restaurant in general. So much so that even a month later while having dinner with some family back home, we mentioned the place and my aunt (who isn't visiting Vegas for months) made me send her all the info for BabyStacks so that she could go eat those pancakes during her visit.   Well done, BabyStacks. We come back to Vegas at least once a year and I know where one of our stops will always be.",

I ordered the steak & eggs with hash browns and upgraded my original pancakes to the red velvet pancakes. Two of my friends got the red velvet pancakes as well. We absolutely loved them! They are soo delicious. They're the perfect combination of a bit of chocolatey flavor & cream cheese. They were also very fluffy and light, but the edges had a little crispiness to them which was good.  The hash browns and eggs were yummy as well. The steak, however, wasn't all that. It had a very charred taste to it. I ordered it medium rare and there was very little pink to it. It was also very tough and hard to chew. I could have done without the steak.  The ambiance of the place was nice. It was very clean. I don't think they turn on the A/C though, which I didn't mind much but my friends did. They had ceiling fans running but I guess with that many people in one place, it tends to get a little warm.   We waited for about 20 minutes to get a table because it was so busy, this isn't a bad thing.. just shows how good this place is. Our server was very nice and friendly.   I'm docking a star only because of the steak. I LOVE steak and I'm not even usually picky when it comes to it. But theirs just didn't cut it. Other than that, everything was amazing.

Carbs, carbs and more heavy carbs!!! I mean I could make the omelette an egg white omelette but it's an up charge and I like eggs. But the eggs did come out the way I like, the rye toast was good and the fruit salad was a good variety!  Grapes, berries and melon was nice. He got the full heavy breakfast deal as he wanted hash browns and he was quiet and smiling so was happy. The customer service was great as our waitress was attentive and friendly. Nice little set up and didn't have to wait long. Good little place but for the type of breakfast I like it's average and I'll probably stick to other places.",

Lemon ricotta was good but nothing special to rave about. Omelette was smaller than we imagined, probably due to the close up pictures here on yelp.  Eggs were super fluffy but flavor was bland.  Pb pancake was dense and flavorful - even though it was small it was very filling.  Hash browns were typical, small in size.  Oh, also had coffee and grapefruit juice - I wouldn't order the grapefruit juice again.  It seemed water down.  Service was nice and so was ambiance.  I hear the line gets ridiculous so I consider us lucky for not having to wait in line to sit (went around 11 am on a Sunday).  Having eaten there now, I don't think it's worth a wait.  I would come back to try the red velvet everyone keeps raving about but otherwise I'd rather go to OPH or Hash Hash.",

The service was fast as well!! And the tables were almost filled up too so I was surprised that the food came out so quickly.   The food was the same quality as their other location.  The red velvet pancakes: chocolately red fluffiness with a dollop of sweet whip cream and chocolate. That cream cheese frosting is not overly sweet  (to me) so it went well with the pancakes.  My other favorite: adobo fried rice omelet. Goshdamn, it's good. The rice was highlighted with pork adobo and wrapped in a thin scrambled egg.   Le sigh. I love this place!!!!",

I had the Portuguese sausage and eggs with the red velvet pancakes. There is plenty of hype about these red velvet pancakes. It pretty much tasted like a cupcake in pancake form. I enjoyed them. But I do have a sweet tooth for things like these. The rest of the breakfast didn't really stand out to me. It was okay.   As much as I have a sweet tooth, this place is just okay. I would probably come back just to try other kinds of pancakes.",

    "text": "The first time I tried this place, it was probably close to two years ago.  Back then I was expecting some amazing mouth watering experience since all I kept hearing about was Baby Stacks (baby cakes back in the day) and read a spread about it in the Seven Magazine.   We had a party of 6 which i understand there was wait since the location is extremely small with only about 10 tables.  I ordered the Huevos Rancheros (corn tortillas layered with refried beans, seasoned diced chicken, cheese, two eggs, and covered with their homemade fresh salsa) thinking that it should be good though yes, i understand that the is place when raved about was on their pancakes.... When the food came out it was okay... I cant really say it was good because it really lacked a lot of flavor.  I had to pour a ton of hot sauce and salt on it to make it taste like anything!  My boyfriend ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict (Toasted English Muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke flavored pork, topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce).  His choice was so much better! The hollandaise sauce was rich and creamy, the pork was flavorful, the english muffin had the right amount of crunch that gave the dish an added texture! I ended up eating half of his dish cause it was so much better then mine!  Red Velvet Pancakes (topped with their fresh whipped cream and chocolate crumbles ans served with cream cheese syrup).  So this is supposedly what they are known for.  I THINK NOT! Yes, it tasted like red velvet cupcake but it also tasted like I was going end up diabetic.  The cream cheese syrup was the topper for me on spitting the piece out of my mouth.  I just couldnt swallow it because it tasted like it was only made out of powdered sugar...   Today was my second time coming here.  We waited for 30 minutes which is okay since our party of 3 expected it on a Sunday.  During that time, I figured i'd look over the menu and make sure I'm careful this time and pick something that ends up being at least good.    WRONG!  I decided to go for simple this time and ordered the Spam and Eggs with the Garlic Rice upgrade.  Spam was heated on the flat top and gave it a hard exterior which made it almost chewy and not what I want in spam.  The garlic rice had no flavor at all and I actually thought it was just plain rice and didnt give me the right order until I noticed a big chuck of onion at the bottom of my plate and I thought \"Oh i guess they did get the order right, but this doesnt taste like anything!\"    The buttermilk pancakes that came with the dish wasnt bad (which i'm glad cause I really hope nobody would be able to mess up regular pancakes especially a place known for their pancakes).  However the pancakes were cold... which is pretty strange since the plate it was on was a little bit warm.  Normally I would understand this if I left it on the table for a while but once the waiter put it down, I checked cause it looked cold.    I think the only thing they got Truely right on my order was my over easy eggs...   My boyfriend ended up getting the Biscuits and Gravy.  The gravy wasnt too bad with the help of salt! The order comes with 3 small biscuits that are hard.  I take that back, only 2 were hard and the last one couldnt even be cut when you stabbed it with a fork.  Yes, he did try to do this and the fork amazing stayed completely vertical in the air.   When we asked if the biscuit were usually like this, the waiter said no but in that hesitated tone that made you think somebody knew but hoped the customers didnt noticed...   I will never come back to this place.  One time, shame on me, second time, shame on them!",

This past weekend I tried the lemon ricotta pancakes (not a big fan of lemon, so...not a big fan of these), Bananas foster pancakes (my new fave!!), and spam scramble (delicious, but trying to cut my meat intake ;). Other great pancake dishes are the White Chocolate pancakes and cinnabun, both super delish, but I do have a huge sweet tooth so I may be biased.",

Prices are very reasonable (never paid more than $25-30 for two people) and definitely worth the quality of the food. They have some policies you might want to be aware of if going with a group... they don't split checks and all members of a party must be present to be seated. On weekdays, I've never experienced a wait longer than 5 minutes. I have yet to attend on a weekend, though.",

    "text": "This diner is only open until 3pm, and when I walked in, the place was full of people. I ate at the counter and had the spinach eggs Benedict - an eggs Benedict that uses bacon, spinach, sauteed mushrooms & onions. The spinach, mushrooms and onions were fresh and good quality. I was in the mood for eggs Benedict, but the last couple places I ordered it, they made it with some sort of ham instead of Canadian bacon, and I didn't want to risk that again (fool me once, shame on you...). I was also impressed by the perfectly poached egg - probably because that is a skill that continues to elude me. The coffee was fresh and had a good flavor, albeit a bit too weak for my liking.  The Hollandaise sauce was also fresh, plentiful and had a good consistency, but it wasn't seasoned properly. I couldn't taste any lemon in the sauce, which was disappointing, and I could tell that there wasn't any salt in it whatsoever. Perhaps this was to counterbalance the bacon (and I'm not a fan of oversalted food), but if you don't put any salt in it at all, it's not going to taste like anything. The low-point of the meal were these country potatoes. They were very dry and clearly frozen, and my mom's are much better. They do, however, give you several options for a side, and the obviously correct choice would have been the pancakes, which is what the restaurant is known for.  Overall, I was impressed by Babystacks Cafe. If I hadn't ordered coffee, the meal would have come out under $10, so it's definitely a good quality for the price. I'll certainly be coming back and next time, I'll order the pancakes as my side. Babystacks Cafe is worth the trip.",

If you know me then you know that I expect a couple things under these conditions:  a) some damn good food b) a lot of it c) food has to live up to the yelp hype since I researched the shit out of this place.  I walked away a little disappointed for the following reasons:  1) small portions 2) waited 20 minutes for a table at 2pm (popular place, i get it) 3) mediocre quality 4) I really wanted to like this place based on the reviews!  Here's what we ordered:  Kahlua pork grilled cheese (2/5) - bland and sandwich wasn't thick, very thin and unsatisfying  spam and eggs w/garlic rice (3/5) - while this was good (its very hard to screw up spam and eggs), the ratio of garlic rice to spam/eggs was low on the rice side. I asked if I could get more rice since there wasn't much of it and the waitress replied that to get a side of white rice it would be another $3. REALLY? That's ridic. I didn't eat all my spam for this reason...  red velvet pancakes(5/5) - very good, as expected since this is what everyone raves about. I did enjoy this but not enough to make up for the main breakfast dishes.  If you like pancakes for breakfast then come here otherwise i think other breakfast joints would serve you better.",

I ordered the Mexican omelette, minus the carnitas, which you can do if you don't eat meat or don't like an ingredient in their put together omelettes. My bf ordered the breakfast burrito, once again without the meat. The Mexican omelette was a 7/10, which is pretty decent on my scale. I'm the spicy type of person, and so I had to soak my eggs in Valentino (which they provide, yippee!). The Bf definitely enjoyed his breakfast burrito, which came with a side of potatoes as well (seasoned or hashbrowns)...but I think he liked the Mexican omelette more too!    The omelet also comes with a side of potatoes and 2 babystacks, so it's like getting a WHOLE meal and more.   I'll be back ;)",

I was expecting a chocolatey tasting one. Their whipped cream is so goooood! I forgot to task if it's homemade. We tried the lola's chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in so much egg.. I thought it was way too much egg. If I would make it, I would add more rice and less of the egg but probably they had to make it that way to be able to wrap the rice well. Service: Good customer service, friendly staff. Ambiance: Fair (uncoordinated decor) Price: $$ Food: Good! Huge serving. Sharing recommended.",

Yes there is quite a wait but my friend and I were catching up so it went by quickly.  From the looks of the menu, I wanted to order everything.  Being part Filipina from Hawaii, it was refreshing to see the food had that same ethnic vibe.  I ordered the corned beef hash, eggs, & garlic fried rice.  I really didn't like the texture of the corned beef hash.  It was too processed, and like another Yelper noted, reminded me of dog food.  The garlic rice was good, like my mom's.  I also didn't care for the pancakes.  They tasted very strongly of baking powder.  I can't remember what my son ordered but he ate it all without complaints.  My friend, also from Hawaii,  ordered the Loco Moco and ate all of hers.  She ordered a short stack of the red velvet pancakes.  I tried them and again, the taste of baking powder was overpowering.  The cream cheese syrup was good.  My son ate the rest and liked them.    I am not completely turned off by the place and want to give them another try.  Perhaps the pancakes were just bad that day?  I want to try other items on the menu.  I think it's great there are Hawaiian-style breakfast items on the menu even though the owner is not from Hawaii.  Oh yeah, we were told that the chili on the menu is Zippy's chili!!!  I will be back here and hope to upgrade this review.",

After about a 15 minute drive and 5-10 minutes wait, we ordered short stacks of the banana cream pie pancakes that I so enjoyed on our last trip.  The batter must have been too thick because our pancakes were noticeably thicker and drier. A big disappointment.",

    "text": "I can't believe I haven't reviewed this place yet. Babystacks is a great, consistent breakfast choice for anyone living in the Spring Valley area. I've been going here since they opened and I've tried most of the things on the menu (except the lunch stuff). They have tons of creative pancake flavors, many of which can be an upgraded side for other breakfast entrees. I recommend the red velvet, lemon ricotta, and the strawberry pancakes. The red velvet pancakes come with a cream cheese syrup and a whipped cream on top. The strawberry pancakes have a strawberry syrup, fresh strawberries, and whipped cream on top. Then the lemon ricotta is a thin, crepe-like pancake with lemons and powdered sugar.  I highly recommend getting a skillet or the adobo fried rice, then upgrading the side to your favorite babystack for an additional fee. It's worth it to have both if you're hungry then just take home any leftovers. The adobo fried rice is something I've never had at another restaurant. The fried rice is wrapped in a big omelette, probably like 3-4 eggs if I had to guess. The rice itself is flavorful and I love that you can taste a bit of vinegar in it with the meat.  The staff here is always friendly and attentive. They'll refill your water or coffee before you even need to flag them down. The prices are great, with most things hitting just under $10. When you're ready to go, they'll hand you the check and you go up to the front register to pay when you're done. They have a big parking lot in this plaza so there's more than enough space. Just try to avoid the weekend brunch crowd, when the wait can sometimes be 30+ mins. Other times, you'll be seated almost immediately. There's bathrooms in the back, always clean. And they have a very homey interior with TV's usually playing news or sports.",

We either hit up Babystacks after our long drive into the city, after a long night of drinking, or a fill up before we head out. Every time we've visited it has not disappointed. The general feel and vibe of the place is homey and friendly. The goats and servers are great and very helpful. They offer a variety and range of breakfast, brunch, and lunch items to cater to any tastes or cravings. One of our favorites is the loco moco with the garlic rice. We also like all of the various skillets they have. They are definitely known for their vast selections of pancakes. I think we're unconsciously working our way down flavortown to find our favorite, but believe me, all of the ones we've tried so far have been fantastic.   The flavors and portions are large so come in hungry.  This place will continue to be a favorite spot of ours and the tradition will continue as long as we visit the beautiful city of Las Vegas. I have and will continue recommending Babystacks to everyone I know.",

    "text": "Stacks on stacks on stacks!  I used to love coming here! I was first introduced to a Babystacks cafe (a.k.a Babycakes) by a friend but we used to go to the one over in summerlin. Once we moved, this one became our favorite.  This place, like every other location is always busy! Which isn't a problem, just be prepared to wait about 30-45min depending on how big your party is, especially on the weekends.   Ever since this place started expanding and opening up more locations, the service went downhill. The food is still pretty good depending on what you order. My favorite of course are the red velvet pancakes. They are soooo worth the long wait. They have a variety of pancakes you can choose from. But they also have everything else; omelettes, crepes, French toast, burritos to name a few.  I've tried quite a few different dishes, they used to do so much better. The food used to taste delicious and the prices were reasonable. But it's been a few visits where the food had to be returned. For the most part I stick to just ordering their pancakes.  I was so excited to bring my mother for breakfast, she had never been and I had hyped it up. But it was such a disappointment. The steak was so tuff the fork wouldn't even go in. Her whole meal was a disaster. We waited almost an hr to be seated and almost another hour after ordering. So by the second time they messed it up my mother had lost her appetite, and the waitress at the moment was so rude a decided to get an attitude and argue! Smh..  The service can be a hit or miss, but for the most part it's a miss. It's never consistent.  On a different occasion we showed up around 1230-1pm, after being seated and placing our order I started to get a strong smell of ammonia. They had already closed off one section of the restaurant, which to me was weird since they were still opened for two more hours.   Once our food arrived, the smell of ammonia was so strong that I could practically taste it as I was eating. They had actually started moping in the area where we were siting as well as other customers and left the bucket sitting there without them using it. They had already mopped the area that was closed off so that's where the smell was coming from in the beginning. So I nicely asked my waitress if they could please at least wait till we left, but I was ignored cuz they kept on going.   If it wasn't because of their red velvet pancakes, I wouldn't come back..",

I got the Sausage Biscuit Benedict and the Orange Creamsicle Pancakes. Both were great, but the pancakes were amazing! IT was citrus-y and sweet (not too sweet) with a orange syrup and cream cheese sauce, just like a dreamsicle. It would be hard for me to go back and pick a different pancake, although there are so many to choose from! Must-try when in Vegas!",

Ordered two eggs over medium with sausage links, garlic rice and short stack of buttermilk cakes...eggs were cooked correctly but were cold; garlic rice was heavy with oil and too much onion; pancakes arrived to the table three minutes after the eggs and were undercooked, still wet in the middle.  Not a good visit this time; seating is still uncomfortable as I'm a big guy and was seated at a small table ...anyone passing by me couldn't do so without bumping into me. Managed to eat half my breakfast before I gave up..the aftertaste of the garlic rice oil still heavy on my tongue...",

I'm a local girl that is used to making the rice plates at home, so thats my take away from my rating.  I've seen how small their omelets are and giggled to myself.  If they know people from the islands, that's a pupu size portion.  Pupu as in appetizer.  Their carrot cake pancakes, bomb.  I can never make up my mind between having eggs or pancakes, so I go for the combo.  I do the Portuguese sausage, or cornbeef hash, eggs, and garlic rice with an upgrade of carrot cake pancakes.    I've tried the Kalua Benedict.  Eeeeeh, its okay.  I say that because if you have had Cinnamon's in Kailua, its hard to get that anywhere else.  My Kalua Pig always seems to be dry.  Like its been sitting under the heat for too long.    Like most breakfast joints, this place gets very busy.  So if you do come with a large group, you will find yourself waiting for awhile.  Same like the bathroom, there is only one.    Will I return, yes.  I crave their carrot cake pancakes.  Oh, don't forget to look on the board. Sometimes they have specially made pancakes for the day/month.",

I cry even more when thinking of the kalua pig omelette.    We went for brunch on Friday at around 11:30 AM.  There were a group of 6 before us but other than that, not much of a wait.  We got our seats within 10 minutes.  Love that they had Hawaii-an food selection.  i ordered the kalua pig omelette while one bff got a crepe and the other bff (who i'm mad at), got the red velvet panackes.   The crepe, was just a crepe.  But the pancakes were warm and delicious and so much like a red velvet cupcake.  A perfect accompaniment to my slightly salty kalua pig.  The kalua pig was perfectly salted and made me miss home just a bit.  The portion was generous; if I were going home after brunch, I'd save some to eat for later.  But I wasn't so I went ahead and ate most of it.  My crepe-bff ate what I couldn't finish.  I can't wait to come back to Vegas for this place!  Slots/gambling/clubbing, I'm not such a huge fan.  But this place, is worth flying back for.",

The restaurant was mildly busy, with a large group of 12 just having sat down minutes before me....which might be the reason for this review.  I had the lemon ricotta pancakes. They were not cooked well, in fact two of the 3 weren't cooked all the way through. This was very disappointing to me. Service was great again, food arrived on time (after the party of 12). Just not cooked well...and that is not expected. I might give them one more try but I expect better.",

My boyfriend likes a specific combination for breakfast and they actually were able to accommodate with him & didn't deny what he wanted. He got the homemade cornbeef hash with poached eggs on biscuits and drizzled with hollindaise sauce. ( Irish Benedict ) he was happy they accommodated what he wanted.   I was impressed with their omelette! I got bacon, cheese, spinach & mushroom. Everything came out hot, which is good! The hash browns were a little bland, definetly needed seasoning & we wish they were more crispy!   Red velvet pancakes were on point!!   We will be coming back for sure :)",

The young woman at the front desk estimated we could be seated in about 25 minutes. I was incredulous. And I was wrong. They had us seated faster than that. The menu is incredible, with many very interesting crepes, pancakes, burritos, omelets, and even sandwiches. My wife and I decided to share a short stack of hazelnut pancakes and the cookie butter French toast. The French toast was amazing. It had cinnamon, cake crust crumbles, and Nutella drizzle all in one breakfast dish. YUM! If I had eaten the whole thing by myself, I would have gone into sugar shock. But it would have been worth it. Best French toast ever! By comparison, the pancakes were a disappointment. Yes, it had Nutella on top. It also had a huge mound of whipped cream. Even with the Nutella and the whipped cream, the pancakes were somewhat disappointing. Maybe if we didn't have the French toast to compare it to, it would have seemed better. My daughter had the breakfast burrito with a side of two chocolate chip peanut butter pancakes. She loved the whole thing. All of this delicious but decadent eating and no dish was over $10. Good food, reasonable prices, an excellent service. I will definitely be back again",

I ended up ordering the, \"build your own\", omelette; which comes with a short stack of pancakes (or toast) and potatoes. For all 12 people ordering, our food came out in a very timely manner. Everyone's plate looked great. Personally, my food was okay. I enjoyed the omelette (nothing special). But my pancakes tasted very bitter and like card board =\\. For some reason, the plain ones are just not very appetizing. They were tough. I'd totally recommend ordering a specialty stack of pancakes . Those were flavorful and delicious (as I tried my husbands and friends red velvet and banana pudding cakes - very delicious) .",

I was prepared to have my mind blown, ready to have a foodgasm from the supposedly amazing pancakes.   Is it in yet? Unfortunately, if I have to even ask then we have a problem. It's not like there was anything wrong. It was actually pretty good (albeit a bit too sweet and heavy) but the price is what made it just ok. The prices for the menu in general are a little on the high side compared to other breakfast places. However, the short stack is perfectly filling for me.  Service is decent and decor is bland and could use an update, especially when compared to the northside location.",

They were so fluffy, tasty, and just the right amount of sweet. Absolutely amazing. They have many flavors to choose from, and they all sounded great. Can't wait to get back and try some others! I saw they had seasonal flavors too! It's a cozy place, but you get your food quickly and it does not disappoint. Can't wait to get back here!",

We got two orders to share among the two of us. One was baby chick omelet and the other was red velvet pancakes. Us two don't eat much so it was perfect. Might be not enough for those who eat a lot.   We ordered short so it came with 3 pancakes only. Full order would be 5. I don't like cream on my pancakes so I asked for it on the side. I'm glad I did cause the pancake was sweet enough by itself. The powder was different from most pancakes. More moist? But I love it!!   The omelet was not bad either. I forgot what topping was in it but it was flavorful. I love their seasoning potatoes! Just perfectly crispy and not too salty.   Service was a tad slow but they were busy also. Definitely friendly people though! I guess this place could replace my breakfast at Hash House A Go Go after all.",

I decided to try the cookie butter French toast. Omg so good! I was a little hesitant because it sounded like it would be too sweet for me, but it was perfect. It was French toast with cookie butter in the middle of the breads, drizzled with Nutella. It was a little crispy on the outside and soft on te inside. If this was anything like the rest of their menu, I'm definitely going to be back!",

It appears to be a family owned establishment, and that showed by the warm, genuine welcome we received upon entering the front door. On a Sunday, BabyStacks was packed, but we were able to snag a table in about ten minutes.   BabyStacks has a reputation for a robust menu featuring every pancake flavor you can think of, in addition to hearty breakfast classics that come with a unique Filipino touch. I wanted both sweet and savory in my belly before the journey home to San Diego, and, therefore, opted to have the Kalua Pork Benedict and a small order of the Carrot Cake Pancakes with cream cheese icing.   The Kalua Pork Benedict was amazing. The pork was succulent and flavorful. Loved the potatoes on the side. Unless you're a vegetarian, I challenge anyone to have a bite of this dish and not walk away happy. I enjoyed the Carrot Cake Pancakes, but I regretted not picking a different flavor. The pancakes were very good, but they weren't as moist as I was imagining them to be. On my next visit, I'm going to have the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes.   My breakfast companion opted for the Adobo Rice Omelette. An imaginative dish that worked on every level. I snagged a bite and would have equally been pleased had I ordered it.   So, make BabyStacks part of your Vegas itinerary the next time you're in town. It's charm will undoubtedly warm your heart.",

The seasoned potatoes on my dish were lightly seasoned but still satisfying. I didn't try the hash browns but from the plates I've seen they look good.   The red velvet pancakes were delicious! Very very well made and had a good flavor. We had to order an extra cream cheese syrup for the pancakes.   Overall this a really good place to go for a Hawaiian style breakfast off the strip!",

    "text": "So disappointing! We have been waiting to try this place, but there is always a huge line. Finally we got in early on Monday. The pancakes - which should be the best item on the menu considering the restaurant name- tasted so strongly of baking powder that I could barely eat them. To top it off, one of them was totally raw in the center so I ate a mouthful of raw batter. The coffee tasted like acid and was not good at all. The Zesty Chicken skillet was lean on chicken and heavy on potatoes- though it was fresh and flavorful. The restaurant layout is not relaxing at all- you feel like you are in the middle of the server station. One positive- the service was excellent.",

    "text": "Stopped in for breakfast because wifey's never been, and its a favorite within the Yelp Las Vegas community.  Not only is it my favorite meal of the day, but I almost always have to get a savory item AND a sweet item. Wifey kept it simple and ordered Cheesy scrambled eggs and hash browns with an upgrade of Rocky Road pancakes. I had the Adobo Fried Rice Omelette, substituted the macaroni salad (but still got it anyway) and  upgraded to their famous Red Velvet Pancakes. I love banana pancakes and banana cream pie, so  I had to try their banana cream pie pancakes as well.  I KINDA SORTA FORGOT two important words though.......  Short Stack.........DOH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! (Must've been a sign of hunger!)  I killed my omelette and  we both preferred the Red velvet pancakes as the rocky road ones sounded better than it tasted. Out came the Banana Cream Pie Pancakes, and that plate of 6(or was it 8???) pancakes was enough for 2-3 people! I dug in and wow! were they good! It felt like I was eating dessert for breakfast. I also kinda wish they would've toasted the almonds for added flavor though, just sprinkling them on raw didn't do any justice.  Anywho, although I didn't kill it, I did some serious damage leaving just one pancake  left. \"Whoa!, you really put a dent in those pancakes!\" A table next to us said...\"Are you a competitve eater?\" \"No, but I did have 80 pieces of sushi in one sitting, and put away a 12 scoop bucket of ice cream with the works in an hour.\" I replied........ALOHA!!!

The hazel nut is a Nutella lovers dreams.  The cream sickle was like....well...a cream sickle. We left filling full and wanting to take a nap.  In fact we didn't even have lunch!

Filipino fusion breakfast food. Amazingly delicious.  Our table ended up ordering the same thing - Cora's Corn Beef Hash & Eggs $10.95. You can choose to have it with potatoes or hashbrowns, 2 eggs any style, and it comes with regular pancakes.  I got mine with eggs over medium, garlic rice (extra $1) and nutella pancakes (extra $1). My friend got it with eggs over medium, hashbrowns, and macadamia nut pancakes. My other friend got it with eggs over medium, potatoes, and lemon ricotta pancakes. There was no talking at breakfast. And every morsel was eaten. So incredibly flavorful and delicious!  They also bring you a smorgasburg of hot sauces with your food - you don't even have to ask. The menu is extensive and they have all sorts of pancakes and specialties (our neighbor table got the Kalua Pig Benedict and the Loco Moco and was raving about it).  Service was great! Restaurant was super clean and a chill, mom and pop ambiance. If you make a reservation, they won't seat you unless your whole party is there -so respect the rule. They weren't busy when we arrived at 9am, but other reviewers say the place gets packed so be ready for a wait if you aren't there early!",

My husband ordered the chicken fried steak meal; the chicken fried steak was thick but cooked thoroughly, their gravy was delicious. His only complaint was the eggs and hash browns were  bland.   I ordered the white chocolate macadamia nuts pancakes (short stack) and only finished two out of the three. It was delicious, but I wish there were more white chocolate and powdered sugar on top and more nuts in the pancakes.    Overall, we might go back after trying a few more local breakfast spots.",

It took awhile to get to the cinnamon- for awhile I felt like they were just regular pancakes.  The service was friendly, and coffee was refilled frequently. They do very brisk business, so you'll likely have a wait if you visit on a weekend. Prices were very fair- 2 people can eat well for $20.",

The real star here though are those red velvet pancakes... they are perfectly balanced between pan and cake. So moist and decadent but also light and airy.

It's unfortunate that we weren't particularly hungry when we visited, because so many flavors looked good.  We were very sad to only try two of them.  However, the two Babystacks we did have were fantastic.  There was some wait at the restaurant but it wasn't terrible, particularly in consideration of the fact that it was a weekend morning.  We were told that they're soon opening another location nearby, which should help move people through a little faster in the future.  The service was great; our waitress was good humored and offered several suggestions.  After much discussion, we chose red velvet pancakes and orange Creamsicle pancakes.  Both were amazing.  After trying each flavor, I couldn't believe that more restaurants don't use flavored batter.  It's really a brilliant idea.    If I ever make it back to Vegas, Babystacks will be high on my list of places to visit.  Their unique and delicious pancakes are definitely not to be missed!",

They didn't have chili today so they got chicken strips. My other son for spam scramble, always good too! My hubby usually gets either the Kalaha pork sandwich,  he likes that too.  Today he tried the Adobo fried rice. It was yummy. Lots of eggs but the filling was good.  We Co e here every visit to Vegas.  So worth it prepare for lines,  usually 20 to 25 mins. Packed waiting room area. They don't split check or seat incomplete parties. No reservations.",

I will definitely hit this place up again next time we are in Vegas, make it a place to go to on the way back home. If anything, just to come back for that red velvet cupcake.",

    "text": "Food - 4 star average  Chicken adobo fried rice is like an omelette with rice inside. Srircha makes it taste amazing. - 4 stars. The loco moco was more like a 2 star dish for me. The meat tasted old, like it had a stink to it, like dirty fridge stink. The meat was also pretty pink on the inside. Not bleeding red, but I don't really like my ground beef on the medium rare side. It definitely set me off and I had to force myself to finish what I had. My brother ordered the same thing, but he said his tasted fine, if not great. He loved it actually.  The house potatoes were DELICIOUS! - 5 stars!  The buttermilk pancakes were buttery and fluffy. Definitely will order again. - 5 stars And last but not least... The red velvet pancakes - 5 stars. I've been dreaming of it since...   Service - 2 stars.  The service here was lackluster. We (party of 9) came the day after Christmas and boy did we come at the wrong time. They weren't necessarily busy, but we did have to wait a bit. A party of about 20 went in just before us and it was a HORRIBLE idea to stay after that. The host said he'd separate us, which we didn't mind because we already waited about 30 minutes and our party sat on opposite sides of the restaurant, again no problem. But here's the kicker. The party of 20 that came in before us wiped out the kitchen service as there were only TWO cooks that day. We waited over 45 minutes for our food and by the time the food came, everyone was extremely upset. Our server DID notify us 25 minutes into the wait that they were short on staff in the kitchen. But he never checked on us before or after that notification. We should've left after that, but since we saw the food coming out for the party of 20, we waited. Still, we waited a LONG time after. No compensation made for being there for almost 3 hours. 3 precious day after shopping hours.   TIP: EVERYONE NEEDS TO BE THERE IN ORDER TO BE SEATED.",

We used to travel clear across town to their location on the north side of Vegas just for their amazing Red Velvet pancakes. When we found out there was a new location on the west side of town and just minutes from our house we were sooooooo happy! From the Red velvet pancakes to the zippy's omelet, everything we've tried there has been amazingly delicious. Only drawback is the dining space is small and there is usually a wait, but some things are just worth waiting for! Try this place out. You will not be disappointed.",

I had to get up and ask a bus boy for drinks since no one would even glance at us. I again had to get up and ask for someone to take our order another 5 minutes after that, which he got mad about because he said it was not his section. The other tables all around us got immediate service the whole time. I found out our waitress was supposed to be Cassandra. When I asked her for help, she was extremely rude and gave me a ton of excuses of why she didn't help us. She never came back to the table after that. Our food was delivered by someone else and we were eventually checked on by a different person. I realized that we were the only white people in the entire place and it's extremely sad to think that this is why we were ignored and everyone else was helped.

The best part is being able to order a short stack of pancakes and customizing it to be Hazelnut which came with nutella on top. What a treat! For my side, I ordered a garlic rice which was a nice option that isn't available at typical breakfast places.  Can't wait to come back and probably go to the Enterprise location as I am located in South Henderson now. Would love if they had a location near the M resort or bicentennial and sun city :)",

    "text": "Ah yes my 100th review goes to Babystacks. I have been here at least 4 times since I've moved to Las Vegas. And I only moved this year!  So coming into this restaurant, it feels like your quick breakfast dining experience. Coming up to the host/hostess we were immediately greeted; getting seated was fairly easy. We usually never have a long wait. Ive sat both at the dining area and the small bar.   I have tried a few things at this restaurant. I've enjoyed the adobo fried rice omelette, the corned beef and the loco moco. While I've enjoyed the adobo fried rice, I would say that they can add a bit more adobo flavor. The omelette sort of neutralizes the taste so adding that extra bit of adobo flavor would truly add to this dish.   I always upgrade my pancakes. I've had the red velvet, mocha chip, choco chip, banana foster, macadamia nut and even the plain one!  They are all very delicious!!! and no, I have tried all these because I would take a bit off my friend's plates haha. They're so helpful in these reviews.   Anyway, the pancakes are so delicious. Not to mention, they are quite the beauty. They're not only good looking--they truly are yummy. I would refrain from adding syrup to the pancakes as they are already pretty sweet.   The staff here is always so friendly and they actually give you recommendations because they have tried the food. I'll be back for sure babystacks :) Thank you!",

I swear there must be some sort of cake mix in these because they are so sweet and fluffy. The flavor is in the actual batter (rather than just sprinkles on top like other pancake places) and plus the beautiful coconut frosting/syrup. It's unreal! And such a hearty portion. I will be back to also try the s'mores pancakes and banana foster pancakes.   For my main dish I had the corn beef hash. It was such a hearty portion. The perfect amount of salty with corn beef. It mixed perfectly with the potatoes and eggs. Don't overlook this dish.. it's excellent!",

They sat us towards the back which is probably why it took so long for someone to come take our order. My friend and I ordered to share, we ordered the popular fried rice and upgraded to the oreo baby stacks, we also go a short stack of the red velvet pancakes, and a side order of sausages.   The fried rice was enclosed in an omelette and comes with a side of potatoes. We thought it was a pretty dry dish, not one of our favorites. We had to use a lot of ketchup and hot sauce. The pancakes on the other hand were delicious! My favorites were the red velvet, it wasn't too sweet and it was very fluffy. The dipping sauce was so good. The oreo ones were a bit too sweet for me, but still very delicious. The sausages were a good choice as well, it was spicy and salty. It helped compliment the fried rice very well. Overall a pretty decent breakfast spot!",

We arrived a little early on a Saturday and there was a line, but he wait was maybe 15 minutes, so not too bad. Once we were seated, our waiter continued to check on us throughout the entire meal - great service!   We ordered an omelette, the honey toast (french toast), and got a babystack of the bananas foster. Everything here was good. Everywhere I go, I always get french toast, and the toast here was solid. However, I would suggest, if you come here you MUST try their babystacks. The pancakes here are just to die for.   Next time I visit vegas again, I'll definitely be coming back.",

And this is my kind of place!  They definitely serve hotcakes! Their pancakes are literally little mini hot cakes, and there are tons of choices. We had a hard time deciding, because there must be over 25 choices of pancakes! We went with carrot cake and German chocolate pancakes, upgraded onto our entrees. They were amazing, like you deconstructed a cake right out of the oven. (I'm definitely a dessert person, and proud of it!)   The entrees were good as well. I had the Portuguese sausage & eggs, with chunk potatoes. Next time I would order the hashbrowns, to help soak up my eggs. The potatoes were ok, but not super exciting. Everything else was great. My friend ordered the cheddar, bacon, & avocado omelette, with hashbrowns, and ate every single bite of it.   The place is very small, so I imagine it's a nightmare on weekends for wait times. We were there on Tuesday at 11am, so not bad at all. The parking lot is shared with a few other businesses in the small shopping center, so parking might be difficult at peak times also.  The prices were reasonable,  especially for such exotic choices. Anytime I'm in Vegas, I'm going to have to work my way through the menu. Chipping off a little bit at a time. Bucket list, try it all.",

The Portuguese sausage breakfast omelet is packed with white rice, it was okay as usual and almost enough for two.  If it was drenched in Zippys chilli this will be the best omelet ever! The side of Portuguese sausage was delicious and works in pairing of any meal, spicy just delicious. The homestyle potatoes are delicious if you like the Hawaiian infused flavors with Western style homestyle potatoes, white onions and the cheese is married beautifully.   The prices are where your IHOP is at and if I remember the pancakes are perfect here.  Surely, you do have to give it a shot.",

I had a strawberry lemonade and ordered the spam and egg meal with an upgrade to their garlic fried rice - which is a must.  To top everything off and to ensure I was full of carbs, I chose the simple pancakes with maple syrup.  My wife and a more colorful choice which included avocado and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. They tasted as good as they looked.   I can see why this place has won many awards within Vegas. They'll be opening another location in April further south near Henderson so waits so start to drop.   If you're in Vegas and not feeling a buffet for breakfast, this place is for you.   You'll come hungry and leave full without breaking the bank.   Can't wait to come back again.",

My first tome here was 02/14/2017 I had just moved her and wanted to take my 8 mo preggo sissy to breakfast to show her my love and appreciation. She choose the place and it was PACKED. And there was a wait. Fast forward i only had eggs, bacon and taters because my pancakes didn't come out until a day later when we were asking for the check. Wasn't a fan of that. I didn't understand why they wouldnt have made them prior to the items that took 4 mins to cook. Anywho, later that day i finally had the carrot cake pancakes that i ordered that morning as an afternoon snack and OMG I feel in love.  I instantly knee why there was that wait lol. Although I still believed they should've make my stacks first, I gave them a second chance and needless to say this has become my favorite  breakfast spot.  I love the pancakes(and I'm  a waffle girl), I adore the cookie butter french toast, and that veggie skillet is one of my absolute favs in Vegas.  Also try the huevos ranchero ! Basically anything on the menu will be good, just expect to wait a while.",

It's also usually a 30 min wait.   Since we came so early, we were seated right away. Carlos was our server. He was very nice and polite. I ordered the corn beef hash with garlic rice, over medium eggs, and red velvet pancakes with no whip cream. My mom had the senior breakfast. Our order came out promptly. The corn beef hash was crispy on top and the over medium eggs were perfectly cooked! I couldn't finish that because I wanted my pancakes lol. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and the perfect amount of sweetness! I also couldn't finish that cos I was pretty full. So they have pretty decent portions.   Our server made sure we had the condiments we needed and always refilled our drinks! Will definitely keep coming back.",

Craving blueberry pancakes today so I chose to brave babystacks on a Sunday for my fix. The wait wasn't too bad and my server was amazing (Berniece I think).  But the pancakes. The people on either side of me had piles of happiness for pancakes. However, my full stack didn't have a single pancake with more than two blueberries(I just uploaded photos of them on here) . Then it was topped with maybe 10 defrosted frozen blueberries and a shake of powdered sugar.   Didn't even finish. I paid for them and left.  Never thought I'd say this but I think I'll drive to IHOP to get a better breakfast.   I might give it another try but feeling burned today.",

The eggs were cooked perfectly, I ordered them over medium and the yolks were perfectly runny and whites were fully cooked.  The potatoes were seasoned really well and the bacon was super thick cut. Way better than dennys or ihop offers. The pancakes are fluffy and the cream cheese syrup is delicious, not overly sweet. The melted whip cream on top adds a nice freshness. It only took about 5 minutes for my food to come out. My waitress made sure my coffee cup was full at all times. Just a few tips: make sure to check out the specials board, if I had I would have ordered the chocolate bliss pancakes instead of red velvet  (since one is limited and the other is permanent). Another one, they have this posted everywhere, you cannot split guest checks so if you come with a big party just be prepared! I will definitely be coming back!

(5 stars for Summerlin location)  We arrived at about 12:50PM today, more than an hour before they closed. Our server wasn't bad but the food took 30+ minutes. Maybe it's because there was a party of 16 ahead of us.  By the time our food got here, our milks were warm. My friend told the server and he got him a new one, which was nice.  I've never had a problem with the food here but this time my red velvet pancakes were dry on the outside. So were my friends' strawberry pancakes. And our bacon was burnt to a crisp. I don't like to complain and we had already said something about the milk so we didn't say anything.   I'n still a fan of BabyStacks. This one's closer to our house but we decided that we would make the extra drive next time. I don't know if we will be returning to this location.",

Also you can upgrade your pancakes to a specialty pancake which I did.. The waitress recommended the special of the day.. The Banana Foster.. It was good but a little too sweet for me! But I'm sure folks with a sweet tooth will love it!",

I'd say that's a good sign.  We put in our names and were seated within 5 minutes.  We sit down, look over the menu and our waitress comes over to take our drink order.  Then comes back and takes our meal order.  She ordered the 2 egg breakfast and I got the Country Benedict.  Everything was great.  The gravy wasn't smothering and overpowering.  The hashbrowns were crispy as well.  That's all I was looking for in breakfast.  So, I was happy with BabyStacks.",

    "text": "This is definitely a highly recommended breakfast spot.  It had all the makings of a great place--great food, great service, comfortable seating, etc.  Both locations are a bit of hump off the strip, but are great places to hit up after a weekend of binge drinking and other unsavory activities up to and including: donkey shows, midget lap dances, dice games at the MGM west wing alley way entrance, passing out nudie flyers.  I had the adobo omelette and shared a short stack of the red velvet pancakes with the lady.  Besides creativity, the omelette was pretty spot on.  No surprises here with the chicken adobo fried rice wrapped in an omelette.  Just good eats.  I could make a recommendation of trying to use pork instead of chicken next time.  The omelette also came with what could possibly be the best macaroni salad I've had in my life.  Rich and creamy with a possible hint of garlic or something magical, it left me wanting more and licking the tiny bowl the serving came in.  For the piece de resistance--red velvet pancakes.  Seems like a great idea in theory and even better in practice at babystacks.  The pancakes had a perfect melding of  cake and pancake texture while maintaining that subtle red velvet taste.  The cream on top was absolutely phenomenal and I would definitely consider that as a bath water substitute.    All in all, great place with great food and service. Like I said, it is now a Vegas tradition of mine and you might want to consider making it one of your as well.  Unless, your leaving Vegas tradition is something like midget lap dances.  That sounds way better...",

I wasn't in the mood for super sweet so I went more traditional breakfast with blueberry pancakes, eggs, bacon and potatoes.  Pancakes were too heavy on the blueberries for my liking... can I have some pancake with my blueberries? The potatoes were very boring with little to no seasoning or flavor. I would think they would mix some more in there.. where's the chopped peppers and onions or something?? The eggs were eggs and the bacon was bacon.  Some of the other dishes I saw come out looked pretty good so I'll have to come back and try it. Maybe the red velvet pancakes are that good that I'm an idiot for not ordering them.  Service was fair from what I remember and I was happy that it didn't take as long to get seated as they quoted us. TV at the little bar area had on CNN which I thought was pretty strange. Who wants to watch that?",

RED VELVET PANCAKES oh yaaaa   Red Velvet Pancakes: 4/5 I'm not a big pancake person because I'm not much of a sweets person but my boyfriend is. He loved them! practically inhaled them. The velvet pancakes were very soft and fluffy and you could definitely taste the red velvet especially topping it with cream cheese icing. A little sweet for my taste but my boyfriend loved it.   Bacon Spinach Eggs Benedict with Hollandaise sauce: 5/5 I've never had eggs Benedict but I was looking for something on their menu that consisted my favorite's for breakfast: eggs, cheese, spinach, bacon, sausage. Closes thing they had was the spinach eggs Benedict. I was iffy about the hollandaise sauce because its a buttery sauce but it complimented the Bacon Spinach Benedict perfectly. The hollandaise sauce kind of taste a bit cheesy to me.   Pastrami Sandwich: 3/5 My boyfriend ordered this, he said it was a bit salty but that's pastrami for you. There wasn't anything special to the sandwich when I took a bite so I'm rating this average.   Coffee: 0/5  I was actually disappointed about their coffee, I don't know maybe I was \"expecting\" too much? BUT When I hear \"cafe\" I think of coffee's & espresso's. Yet all they had was regular coffee and black. This place came off to me more like a DINER than a CAFE.",

I took in the ambiance--soothing music that suited the mood, wooden tables and chairs, TVs in good positions, and overall, it was a comfortable setting. The wait for my food was never too long either. These factors also held True the second time around. Now, here's what I've got to say about the food:  - Red Velvet Pancakes: Now this, this is what a lot of people like to come for, so I had to try it. It really is a delicious stack. The ratio of whipped cream, to pancake, to cream cheese syrup is the key to the perfect bite of this dish! I do have a comment on it's consistency though. I prefer pancakes that are fluffy and melt in your mouth. These pancakes have a little bit of a chew to it but not enough to be drastically inedible. In fact, my peers didn't even notice. Otherwise, this alone is a great reason to come to BabyStacks! - Adobo Fried Rice: I love it and I couldn't stop eating it. It is flavorful and some might say it's a little salty, but that's just how I like it! - Country Fried Steak and Eggs: Nothing special, but still very tasty!  BabyStacks is a great place to eat and definitely offers a lot of variety. Bring everyone with you!",

I would say that if there is a wait on a Thursday morning and they close at 2, it is most likely worth my time. The waitress was very nice and easy going. My husband had the club which was something he was craving and he was very satisfied. I have the blackened chicken sandwich and I was very good. The chicken was tender, the lettuce was crisp, the cheese was perfectly melted and the bread was just the right amount of toasted. The fries that came on the side were the ones that you would get at an old soda shop. They were thin but had a great flavor that I didn't need salt for.",

I was very impressed with the brunch so I had to write about BabyStacks while it was still fresh in my mind.  I went to BabyStacks today with the Camilleon and her Uncle Kai. I'm already a fan. I know I will be coming here again.   I needed to carb up for a cootie-tag session at town square and BabyStacks somehow crossed my mind. OTW! It was 1 o'clock and the place was packed. A very good sign. The hostess said it would be a 15 to 20 minute wait. We were seated in 10.   I order the steak and eggs over easy with hash browns, and opted for the upgraded two stack red velvet pancakes. Uncle Kai gets  some kind of avocado sandmich and fries with a stack of banana cream pancakes. The steak and eggs meets the standard specifications of steak and eggs. Nothing was left on the plate. I did not sample the avocado sandmich so I can't comment on it. Let's get to the pancakes. I did sample the homie's banana cream pancakes. I had one bite. It was    AIGHT. Now to their Red Velvet Pancakes. \"OH SHIT! LOOK AT THE MOTHAPHO'KIN WHEELS!!!\" I finally get to try these things. It came with cream cheese syrup and topped with whipped cream. Hmmm? Where's the syrup? I can't eat this without... I go ahead and take a bite. DAMN SUN!?! I tell Camille's uncle to try the pancakes. Both of us were instant fans. Needless to say, all of my plates were cleaned off.   My brunch started off good with a solid steak and eggs and ended off great with DEM RED VELVET PANCAKES SUN!!!  BabyStacks...EYE LIKA CHU PEOPLES!!!",

I also tried the lemon riccotta pancakes and they were good and light. It sound good right now as I'm writing. YUM!!!",

This is my second time coming here and I'm only here for one reason, red velvet pancakes! I'm not a huge fan of pancakes, but these are amazing!! They are just the right amount of fluff and melts in your mouth. My daughter loves the cookies and cream pancake, which she remembered from years ago from our first visit. Other than the pancakes, everything else is average. I would only recommend coming here for their pancakes. Because they are so busy, the service isn't up to par. The waiters/waitresses are not very attentive. The food also takes a while before it comes to your table, so don't come if you're starving!",

I'm not too much into eating sweets or pancakes for that matter, but I can tell you this, this place was good and so were their red velvet pancakes. Also got to try their rocky road pancake and i'll tell you, it was better than the red velvet pancakes that's for sure. I think it was just better to me because it's just my kinda taste, I prefer chocolate over red velvet any day, but I highly suggest getting the red velvet pancakes anyways, because every here seems to like it. Overall having breakfast here was good, they have different stuff to choose from other than pancakes such as bacon and eggs and stuff. If you decide to come here, do be prepared though to wait awhile, this place seems to always be packed.",

I love the island music, the tvs on sports, all the local people that come in, the staff is so friendly and personable.  I totally feel like I'm home and it's always nice to see people in there that are obviously not from Hawaii.  Just talking about it now, I think I'm going to head on down!  It's only a block from my house which is always great.  Anyone who lives in Vegas knows westside is the best side! Oh! The only reason I didn't make it 5 stars, is one time I ordered for take out and when I ate it at home it didn't taste nearly as good; my garlic rice was weighed down and my Kalua pig was just whatever.",

I ordered the short stack version of the bacon pancakes b, and yo' I thought they tried to play me son!  So they gave me the short stack, 3 pancakes nahmean?  I'm like cool, and then they had 2 ripped pieces of bacon floatin' on top yo like somebody bit my bacon and left me the fat part.  The FAT part son!  I'm like, yo I thought the menu said bacon infused pancakes b!?  I didn't see no bacon bits creatively infused into the pancake son, matter of fact, I'm glad I didn't complain off top!  Because they did have bacon in the pancakes but it was one whole piece per pancake like as if they cooked one side, waited 3 minutes, threw a piece of bacon on it, flipped it, then cooked it another 3 minutes.  And my bacon was mad chewy son! C'mon son!  If it's Filipino inspired, you know we like our shits crispy b!  Almost burnt to the point where it gets a little ashy nahmean!?  It felt like I was eatin' rubber pancakes with a toy piece of bacon I got from my youngn's fake stove, you understand?  Anyway, I ate it all, cause I was hungry.  Good thing my main event came through tho.  The Chicken Adobo Fried Rice Omelette was right on the money.  I wish they gave me more macaroni salad tho son, they gave me a baby scoop b.  I'm 26 years old fam!  You can't give me the baby scoop with the adult main event son.  I ate that shit in one bite and had nothin' else to off set the adobo flavor.  But yo, I ain't even tryna play this place son, because I saw some other shit on the menu that was probably way better than what I got.  I'm also Filipino, so grabbin' some Filipino food probably wasn't the best idea because my moms be makin' that shit since I was 3 yo, so I'm not really impressed by it nahmean?  All in all, if you tryna impress a shorty yo, do NOT take her here unless you don't care about her or you live 5 minutes away and she says \"If you buy me breakfast, I'll tickle your fancy\".  That's the only time you take a broad here yo.  Anyway, yo the waiter was cool, had my water filled up before I had to ask so you know I was pretty satisfied.  But overall I give this place a 3 out of 7 rating b.  #MoochEats",

Gravy from the chicken fried steak could have stood a little more cook time as it still had that flour taste.  The steak part though had nice flavor and was tender.

He said it was one of the worst breakfast's he has had. The other person upgraded their pancakes to Banana, but was brought regular instead. Waitress never asked if we needed more hot water for our tea. Another thing that drives me crazy is the 2 tables we had pushed together were 2 different heights and 1 of them wobbled like crazy.

For a breakfast joint it is definitely hopping so you want to get here earlier if possible. I always tend to order the same things when I go to breakfast. In this case, the corned beef hash is my go to. The corned beef hash is nothing to write home about I guess. It kind of looks like the stuff from the can so sometimes it doesn't look the most appetizing or appealing. The taste is hit or miss as are the potatoes. Of course the saving grace is always the pancakes which I definitely like the red velvet or the blueberry. The last couple of times I decided to just order to go, because it is easier with a toddler in tow and I really just wanted pancakes. The blueberry pancakes were good, but there were barely any blueberries. I do like that they put fresh blueberries on top, but the ratio of blueberries to batter should be a bit more than what I've seen lately. Overall, breakfast items are decent, but their winners are their pancakes.   P.S. They do a really good job packing to go orders with foil lined boxes so it stays hot on the way home!",

    "text": "Babystacks, I've given you many a go. Inconsistent dishes, mediocre service, but two of the tastiest breakfast items I've had to date.  Babystacks is know for its fluffy pancakes and its Island inspired breakfast items. Adobo Fried Rice. I don't know what this stuff is made out of, but it's so addictive (so probably crack)! On a previous visit, I overheard a guy ask for the rice as a side and the waitress said, of course. A big pile of fresh adobo fried rice arrived with his order.  On my last trip I asked for just a side of the rice and was denied. Being in a large group and not feeling particularly bratty, I let it slide as a friend said she'd take my eggs and I could have the filling. When the food arrived, the rice was delightful except for how crunchy it was. Starving and because the rice was so damn tasty, i plowed away. I was insatiable. To this day, I still find my self muttering Adobo Fried Rice in my sleep...  The rest of the menu is hit or miss, including the pancakes. Most are simply pancakes with dope toppings, but the pancakes aren't anything spectacular. The most delightful I've had were the Cookies N Creme pancakes. Diabettttus for breakfast, but heavenly.  I don't hate, Babystacks, but I don't love them either. Very middle of the road. It's a coin toss and the same can be said for your experience there as well.",

They do have a Few Hawaiian Dishes on the Menu as Well...Such as the Adobo Fried Rice Omelet (My Favorite), and the Kalua Pork with Cabbage Benedict that is Very Tasty as Well! Most of the Items on the Menu do Come with your Choice of Hash Browns, or 2 Other Sides, which are listed on the Menu! Portions are Enough for One, but Could be Shared by 2 People!   Crepes are Also on the Menu, My Sister got the Nutella/Banana Crepes...and they were According to her...Awesome! lol  The Workers are All Very Nice, and Check on You Often! The Cafe is a Little Small, but the Wait Time isn't that Long! There is Ample Parking, and The Overall Look and Feel of the Cafe is Hawaiian Themed, Very Clean, and Tables are Cleaned Very Quick!

    "text": "My best friend is always raving about this place and we were nearby on a Sunday morning, starving of course.   Pulling in I saw a long line, I was thinking about leaving since I was on a tight schedule so I walked in an asked how long the wait time was, for two people it was only 20 minutes so I decided to stick around, for others with larger groups, the wait time was an hour, eek. In the end I only ended up waiting 10 minutes.   I felt a little bit claustrophobic walking in, it was really packed and all of the tables were very close together. You could lean over and eat off of your neighbors plate!   Our waitress came out quick and took our order. For my drink  I decided to go with coffee, blah! It was gross. The coffee tasted watered down like they prepared it, dumped half of it out and refilled it with water, I could get a better tasting cup at McDonald's. For my breakfast entree I went with Cora's corned beef hash, eggs over medium, and substituted the buttermilk pancakes, instead I got the red velvet pancakes.  Food came out quick as well, the corned beef hash was seasoned well, tasted great, but my eggs came out over easy instead of over medium. The red velvet pancakes were mighty tasty, very fluffy and a little crisp on the outside. They were topped off with whipped cream, which went well with the cream cheese syrup. After our food came out the waitress disappeared, we were to never see her again. We were never asked how the food was or if we wanted any refills. We are very generous tippers when we get great service, on this occasion I was thinking of not even leaving a tip but I'm not that rude, she got $3 for her disappearing act!   Honestly, if it weren't for the food, I would have rated this place two stars, but since the food was great (minus the eggs), they get four from me.",

Hunnie Bunnie got the short stack (3) of chocolate chip pancakes and she LOOOOVED them.  I ordered the breakfast plate of Portuguese sausage and eggs. It comes with buttermilk pancakes which I upgraded to the Red Velvet pancakes and potatoes or steamed rice which I upgraded to the Garlic Rice. Obviously. I LOVE me some garlic!!  Everything was GOOD! The Red Velvet pancakes are served with like a cream cheese sauce and whip cream on top. I didn't eat much of these cuz I was concentrating on my sausage and eggs - we boxed up the pancakes and then I forgot all about them so I had to throw them out! BOO!!! I loved the rice though and everything else was NOM too!",

Red velvet was perfect: not too thick on the flavor and not too light, fluffy in the middle. Comes with icing and whipped butter which complemented perfectly. Highly recommend.  Cinnabun pancakes were very sweet and tasted like a donut. If you like sweet pancakes, this is your pancake.  Portuguese sausage were on point: nice flavor and goes well with eggs and hash brown. Highly recommend.  Overall great place and will come back!",

    "text": "My friends totally hyped this place up, even though I'm not a huge fan of pancakes. Then again how can I NOT try the famous red velvet pancakes? Too tempting.  This is a super popular place for breakfast or brunch, and their targeted hours (closing at 2PM or 3PM everyday) make sure they are ALWAYS packed. If you come with a group, make sure you don't have any lagging friends, because they will only seat you when your entire party is present.  I tried the limited edition Chocolate Peppermint Pancakes, which were tasty for the first three bites then were too sweet. The pancakes themselves are chocolate, with peppermint pieces cooked into them. Good thing I only got a small stack! I did try the red velvet pancakes, but they just tasted like flat red velvet cupcakes, as expected.   The wide variety of food at BabyStacks is a little overwhelming, but I guess you could say they have something for everyone. The service is decent (not outstanding) and it's just a hectic place to eat with all the crowds and TVs and bar area and AHH it can get crazy. Definitely an iconic restaurant to check out but nothing special.",

The Cafe seems like it's Filipino, ergo Adobo Fried Rice, with American and Hawaiian influence.  Red Velvet Pancakes -- Fluffy red pancakes topped with chocolate chips and whipped cream. It's served with their absolutely delicious cream cheese syrup so you can flavor to taste. Typically, I get the pancakes without whipped cream. IMO, everything is perfectly sweet without it. The cream cheese syrup is to die for. It's a perfect pairing with the semi-sweet red velvet pancakes.   Rick's Adobo Fried Rice -- Shredded chicken with rice wrapped inside an egg and green onions. Simply incredible. The saltiness of the chicken was just right. Add some hot sauce (Cholula or Sriracha) to give it a kick. It's a hearty portion but it's so dang good I usually finish most of it in one sitting. It also comes with a side of mac salad. You can hardly taste the mayo. Probably one of my favorite versions of mac salad to date.   Service has always been on point. No complaints here!",

    "text": "I had a yearning, a longing. Something was missing during our trip to Vegas. What I needed was......   ***RICE***  Why do I have to be Filipino? Why couldn't the numerous restaurants and huge variety of food on the Vegas strip satisfy my tummy?   I looked up Filipino restaurants on Yelp and found a couple of them (many were off the strip). But I hesitated, afraid I'd be disappointed by the lack of quality in the dishes and I did not want to take such a risk. I searched further as my tummy growled and mumbled \"rice, rice, rice\". Then I hear my toddler say, \"Mommy, I want wice!\"  Then I see it. BabyStacks Cafe. I browsed through their menu of delicious goodness. Kahlua Pork, whaaaat? Red Velvet Pancakes, whaaaat? Garlic Rice, whaaaat? Can you just imagine a big plate of those three dishes and a cup of joe? I was so excited, my mouth watered. I said, \"Screw you, food at the Strip! I'm takin' my tummy elsewhere!\"   This cozy, little restaurant was very welcoming and we were seated immediately. Of course it was only 8:30am in the morning but there were already many people there. We ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which was wrapped in eggs, like an omelette. The hubby loved it. There were so many dishes to choose from... I decided on the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs with GARLIC RICE and a side of buttermilk pancakes. The corned beef was very, very good. Usually when I order this item at other restaurants, it was ehhh but I was really pleased here. As for the garlic rice, it was a little bland for my taste but still delicious. For me, it's all about the stanky breath after eating garlic nawmean!! The red velvet pancakes were fluffy and warm.  Just down all these dishes with a cup of coffee and you'll find yourself in a happy place :)   We have decided that whenever we visit Vegas, BabyStacks will be our breakfast spot.",

My wife ordered pancakes with bacon and I ordered a Mexican omelette with a side of the orange creamsicle pancakes.  I had thought the pancakes were going to be super sweet but these orange creamsicle pancakes were really good. They are served with an orange icing to top the pancakes and the whole meal was enjoyable.  I would effeminately visit this place again since they have a wide selection of dishes.",

It was a lemon pancake topped with strawberry drizzle, whipped cream and fresh strawberries.  Served with a side of house sweet icing.  How could I not get this... I LOVE Strawberries and Lemon!!! My husband got the Kalua Pig Benedict.  So much on his plate that he couldn't even finish it. My daughter ordered the Red Velvet pancakes which was perfect!! Her boyfriend had the B.Y.O.which again was such a huge portion that we had to take the rest to go!! The bacon was crispy, they Portuguese sausage was good but the seasoned potatoes  lacked the seasoning.  Service was just ok but the food made up for it.",

I didn't realize at the time that there was another location or that the street address was the same. Anyway, I visited this location on 04/13/2013 and it was just as great as my previous experience!  Between three of us, we ordered the BANANA CREAM PIE PANCAKES (Bananas in buttermilk batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, sliced bananas, drizzled banana cream sauce, and topped with crushed pie crust and almonds), SPAM AND EGGS BREAKFAST WITH GARLIC RICE, KALUA PIG BENEDICT (toasted English muffin layered with our slow-cooked shredded cabbage and smoke-flavored pork, then topped with poached medium eggs and hollandaise sauce) with seasoned potatoes, and MEXICAN OMELETTE (marinated carnitas, sliced jalapenos, fresh pico de gallo, pepper jack cheese and topped off with sour cream) with hash brown.  Everything was soooo yummy! And I LOVE finding places that make me feel like I'm back home (in Hawaii) eating breakfast at my favorite local spot! Very well done. I love the ingenuity and execution of the different exquisite pancakes as well. I can't wait to try another flavor!",

    "text": "After browsing through the yelp reviews we decided to get the most popular: Ricks adobo fried rice and the kalua pork eggs benedict. Also got a short stack of banana creme pancakes.   Best choice was the pancakes! Omgahh. The banana cream on those things was heavenly. It was just like eating a piece of pie and they fluffiness of the pancakes really balanced it well. Overall it was not too sweet which made it easy to keep eating. They also give you a heaping amount of whip cream.  The other two dishes were kinda meh. Im not a huge fan of egg things so thats my fault really. The adobo fried rice was good on its own but the egg it was wrapped in had no seasoning or flavor so I had to pick it apart. The eggs benedict were not poached very well and was a bit overdone and the huge glob of hollandaise sauce on top made me stop after like two bites.   Overall if youre going to come here stick to the pancakes. They are heavenly. Next time I think ill try the red velvet pancakes everyone is raving about.",

Everything was hot and fresh and the strawberry lemonade was so refreshing. I would truly come here over and over. I did not like how they do not split the checks. My girls and I had to calculate and split the totals up ourselves which was quite a pain. Other than that it would have gotten a 5, instead I gave it a 4. Definitely check it out for breakfast or brunch.",

I am referring to ( you guessed it!) the Country Fried Steak. Since eating this dish at BabyStacks, I haven't touched it at any other restaurant because it just will not compare.   The pancakes are phenomenal and fun as well because of all the different flavors. Makes it feel like you're at an ice cream shop for pancakes. Or a cake shop...........  Love bringing my tourist family and friends here because it's fair prices, off the strip and literally a slice of heaven, literally ;) I also come here a lot with local friends. When you walk in you see that it's the community here - all of them happy because their tummies are full of yummy eats. Impress someone and show them this restaurant, it's fantastic.  Now for the nitty gritty: it is absolutely crowded on the weekends. You will wait up to an hour sometimes to be seated and it is well worth the wait! Customer service is great. Food comes out quickly. Don't be daunted by the crowd - take it as a good indication.  Every location is fantastic!! I've been to three and had the same good experience at them all. Enjoy :D",

Decent sized breakfast/brunch spot.  Only open til 2p w wait times I hear that can grow to almost 2 hrs. Luckily, I went here with my best-friend's older brother before the crowds and didn't have a wait!   Food:  Adobo fried rice omelet was very good! Not greasy like a lot of Filipino food. Rice, meat, and egg were all cooked perfectly. It really worked well. Who would've thought Adobo in an omelet?! We also ordered the White chocolate macadamia nut pancakes! This was a little overkill for me since I'm not a big pancake or sweets guy. If I remember correctly, I finished only half of the split dish.  Service: No issues with the service. Great, attentive, and we were checked up on more than once. Greeted very warmly when we walked in and immediately were shown to our table.  Overall: I'd come here again to try a different pancake dish that's not overkill on the sweets. The Adobo omelet itself is worth the trip back and dare I say, even worth a wait if you happen have one!",

Got to try a pretty good array of dishes because we were a group of four and very willing to share a bite of everything.   The pancakes are obviously what people come in for, and they are phenomenal don't get me wrong -- but I actually really loved the zippy's chili skillet. Chili on breakfast seems so obvious, but for whatever reason I would have never thought to put it together -- it was hands down the best thing we ate there that day.   I ordered the spam scramble, which was just meh, but I probably should've figured that since no other Yelpers really mentioned it at all.   Lemon Ricotta Pancakes & Carrot Cake Pancakes were our babystacks of choice, and boy were they good!   Get yourself off the strip and try this place -- it's totally worth it.",

Other people must know this since there was about a 30 minute wait when we went on a Saturday.   The biggest draw may be that they have about 18 different types of pancakes on the menu (bacon, orange creamsicle, hazelnut, you name it). They also have regular eggs, omelets, french toast, etc. I presume the owners are Hawaiian as that seems to be the theme for some things...and there is a hefty Spam presence on the menu.   I got Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which is basically a chicken fried rice burrito with omelet egg as the wrapper. Cool but not too exciting...I had to drench a bunch of hot sauce on it. Pancakes for me next time.",

They have two girls at the front. I was quoted \"15 mins.\" 35 minutes later I'm still waiting for a table yet I saw 6 open tables. I ask one lady at the front if I should leave as there are empty tables, and people that came after me were seated first. I'm a party of 2 mind you. She said \"you need to wait for the hostess that seats people.\" So - baby stacks - what's the point of her if she can't help your guests? Once I said I was leaving the hostess said \"okay fine go!\" That's how they treat their customers on a Thursday morning at 10:45. The waitress I had came over and said I could sit at her empty table. Her service was spectacular! The only part of my dining experience that was awful was with the rude hostesses. When I asked to speak to a manager they ignored me. All in all- come in for the red velvet pancakes but don't expect friendliness from the staff.",

    "text": "Pancakes-decent. Service- No, just no. Wait time- Not worth it...  The first time I came here I was blown away by the Red Velvet Pancakes. The second time I came here, I realized this place wasn't as amazing  as I originally thought, and considered it decent.  After that, I tried to steer clear from here, but of course everytime someone wants to have brunch- they and their neighbors always want to meet up here, so I go, but not by choice. Like I said- their food is decent, but the wait time is annoyingly long, and not worth  it for the service you get. Even after waiting 45 minutes for a table, the server took 10 minutes to take our order. She came back missing 4 out of 8 drinks, and gave us the wrong 4 when she came back...ok, maybe she was new or having a bad day, but with 3 servers and not that many tables, someone should've helped her out. Another 30 minutes later (no exaggeration here, I promise) she came out with our food.  But wait- The cream cheese syrup is what MAKES the Red Velvet Pancakes decent...no cream cheese syrup?! Guess what happens next? Oh right, I wait...AGAIN, this time for a HALF filled syrup cup!!! I ask, nicely, maybe she'll fill it up a little bit, since it's half full and I server says ,\"it'll be another 75 cents extra.\" Okay- in my defense, I read that it would be extra for the syrup, but I just wanted her to fill up the syrup cup included with my pan-cakes-puh-lease!!!   What in the hell?!?!?  I would've given this place 3 stars if it weren't for the extra hour and a half used in waiting for seating and food...and the syrup!!!",

It seems like the owners picked their favorite dishes from restaurants in Hawai'i & put it all on their menu along with the usual all-american favorites.  We (4 of us) ordered the Kalua Pig Benedict with potatoes, Portuguese sausage with Garlic rice, Banana Fosters pancakes, Adobo Fried rice Omelette, and Red Velvet pancakes. Everything was delicious, with the Kalua Pig coming out as our favorite.  The hostess needs to get to know their dishes to better answer questions at the door, but our waitress was nice along with a timely waitstaff. The only reason they are one star short of perfect was because I felt sick right after & threw up. And continued to feel sick the rest of the day.",

The service here is A+ as well, keeping coffee and water cups full at nearly all times. At this point, you might be wondering: from whence did this four star review come? First, I'd rather give a 4.5 star review. Second, I admit that I've been spoiled by some outstanding breakfasts in my lifetime. Also, I can't order sweet breakfast every time I go out. My only knock on this place is that their savory breakfasts, while still very very good, don't knock my socks off. Again, I haven't had a bad experience here, and I doubt I ever will.

Many of there breakfast items come with buttermilk pancakes on the side, but spend the extra $1.50 for these. You can also order them as a main breakfast plate, but I find that can sometimes be a bit much as far as an over-sweet experience and on the side you get just enough to experience them firsthand.   Some of the things I usually get is the breakfast burrito with Portuguese sausage or the Adobo friend rice, both tasty and winning dishes. Service is quick and they will continue to come by and refill your coffee or water without having to ask or search around for assistance.  The location at Smoke Ranch is by far the best, but that being said it's almost always packed with people and there's a wait. If you go to the other by Flamingo, it's MUCH less crowded. They have one other location and I also heard a Henderson location is on the way.  They do ask for ID if you are paying by debit or credit, so just to be aware.  Good stuff....yummy goodness!",

I finally made up my mind and got the cookie butter french toast (which was absolutely amazing by the way), the red velvet pancakes, and the Rick's adobo fried rice. As I was eating the adobo, I couldn't help but to notice the egg-to-rice ratio. There was simply too much egg for it to be considered an omelette.   I've always been sketchy about breakfast food but after my experience with the French toast, I've decided that brunch is a must for me every weekend. If you let the whip cream melt for a bit before eating your french toast/pancake, it is definitely worth it!   The one thing I wished for was that the location was bigger. There was a tremendous amount of people waiting and it was about a 45-minute wait for three which is pretty excessive for a brunch place.   Overall, I was highly satisfied with BabyStacks and can not wait to come back on my next trip to Vegas! YUM!",

The menu is that perfect pokemon inducing length where you absolutely want to try everything, and that seems like a totally achievable goal.  I had the Orange Dreamsicle Pancakes, which were actual orange flavored, and just lightly sweet. The cream cheese syrup and fluffy homemade whipped cream made them a real treat, and rounded out the flavors. I got a side of bacon that was crispy, flavorful, and perfect, and a nice bottomless cup of coffee, as brunch requires.  My mom had the Cinnamon Bun Pancakes, and from the taste we swapped, they were amazing. My dad had the Strawberry, and would not take a break from inhaling them to answer any questions. He also refused to share. High praise indeed.  I'll be back to Babystacks soon, and often. YUM.",

    "text": "I love me a good brunch, especially after a night of heavy drinking in Vegas.  Babystacks is a good option if you have a car and want to get away from the Strip for a second.  I came here after one such night in Vegas last month, and a delicious fusion brunch was exactly what I needed.  The wait for our party of five wasn't too long, only about 20 minutes or so (compared to our epic wait the night before at Bachannal, this was easy peasy).    I ordered the adobo fried rice, which comes out wrapped in an omelette.  The dish normally comes out with macaroni salad, but they let me change it out for the breakfast potatoes.  I liked the fried rice, but honestly I thought the entire dish was a little dry.  The breakfast potatoes were lightly fried and cubed, so it was hard to go wrong with these.    Since there were a few of us, I was lucky to try some other things too.  The loco moco was amazing, hands-down the best dish we had at the table.  The sauce was on point and the beef was so good, especially for the hungover.  The Kalua pig benedict was good, although not super impressive.  While everyone at the table raved about the white chocolate macadamia nut and red velvet pancakes, I personally thought they were both a bit dry.  Of course, you can dunk the red velvet in the cream cheese dressing on the side, but that's just a bit too sweet for me.  Maybe it's because I'm not really a sweet tooth, but I'd come back for the loco moco.  Service:  Pleasant and friendly.  Ma-and-pa local run kind of place.  Bottom line:  You know those dishes where you try a bite of your friend's and you wish you had ordered that dish?  Loco moco.  No regrets.  And if you have a sweet tooth, try the red velvet or one of the other pancakes.",

We had a great experience, she and the other servers were constantly at us with refills and always made sure we had everything we needed. Amazing service, I wish every restaurant had service like Babystacks!  We had a beef hash with rice, and the breakfast burrito, with a share of pancakes. The beef hash was solid, however the breakfast burrito could have been better, not much meat and the red sauce that it came with was too sweet to pair with it. The hazelnut pancakes were AWESOME.   Long story short, good food, great service, we will be back!",

Undoubtedly a place where kitsch finds prominence but where classics and good diner-service also stand strong it was admittedly with much debate that decisions were made on a menu where no less than a dozen sweet selections and numerous interesting savories plus specials reside but with coffee free flowing a plan was eventually hatched - two sweets, one savory, yes bacon, no potatoes, and much sharing after a short wait.  Beginning savory and progressing to sweet I must say things started shaky with a small plate of $4 bacon and surprisingly bland pork lost to buttery bread and cheese but progressing to \"dessert\" the story turned one-eighty, the thin pancakes fluffy and rich but brought in check by light citrus while the French Toast pulled on no reigns, a full display of decadence with supple egg bread surrounding a slathering of Speculoos and drizzled with Nutella plus a half cup of whipped cream...more than enough to share and impetus for a trip to Centennial Hills to visit Babystacks III soon.",

Bananas, whipped creme, drizzle of some kind of brown stuff on top..yummy!   But taking one bite, I was confused.  The toppings and the pancake didn't work together and the pancake definitely lacked a punch.  I've had great banana pancakes (Bruddah's in Gardena, CA) but these were kind of disappointing.  Blueberry pancakes - same batter as the other pancakes with some blueberries pushed inside and topped with fresh blueberries as well.  Kid will devour anything with blueberries so she like them but once again, the pancake doesn't deliver.  (Stacks in Dana Point, CA - now thats a blueberry pancake!)  Chili skillet - this was very tasty but I wish it had more chili.  One more scoop of that delicious chili would have made me much happier.  I wish the potatoes were swimming in that stuff!  Combine that with a sunny side egg... ono.  Cornbeef hash - this was ok.  Just a plain ground cornbeef hash patty with rice and eggs.  Not too spicy but could have been burned just a little bit longer on the skillet.  Service was good and seating was faster than quoted.  Also noticed the tables were promptly cleaned after someone leaves.  Kind of far but its a decent alternative to an expensive weekend brunch on the strip.",

I got to try the loco moco, corned beef hash, adobo fried rice/omelette, garlic fried rice and the red velvet pancakes. The loco moco, corned beef hash and garlic fried rice were good in their own respects but could be passed on. The adobo fried-rice/omelette on the other hand... delicious. Would love to see over easy eggs on top of the adobo fried rice as opposed to a solid scrambled/omelette piece.. in which I shall note for the next Vegas trip. But what really stole my heart were the red velvet pancakes. I'd break my diet and lose dem gainz anytime for those wonderful pancakes.   Other than that, the service was spot-on and was rather exceptional.   A slight trek from the strip, but quite the delicious hangover cure none the less.  Easy 5-stars.  - Mark InocentesTM",

I ordered the Banana Cream Pie pancakes and they were delicious. I could have used some more whipped cream but they were really good. I also ordered a side of hash browns and omg there aren't words to express how good they were. The hash browns were the perfect combination of being crispy and soft without being burnt or undercooked. If we weren't in a time crunch for our flight,I would have ate a lot more.

ZOMGGGGG ALL CAPS BECAUSE IF YOU GO TO VEGAS AND DON'T GO THEN YOUR LIFE WILL BE WORSE AND YOU WON'T EVEN KNOW.  All right, so the food. I am a huge eggs benedict fan, so after reading the great reviews, I went with the kalua pork eggs benedict. Wow!!! It certainly did not disappoint. Smoky and savory and melt-in-your-mouth tender - mind-blowing. I was torn between wanting to savor it slowly and wanting to shove it all in mah belly at once. My boyfriend had the adobo fried rice, and the second he took the first bite, he had to close his eyes just to take it all in. I tried it too, and I don't even like rice, but I almost wanted to trade mine for his. Almost.  But, the best part of the meal was the pancakes.  We shared an order of Butterfinger pancakes. Let me repeat - BUTTERFINGER freaking PANCAKES. The lady asked if we wanted them made with peanut butter batter and we said yes... best decision ever. They came warm and awesome with candy shavings and a huge scoop of really thick and amazing whipped cream. I'm telling you guys, the noises we were making while eating were downright indecent.   I wish I could paint you all a better picture of just how incredible this food was. Mostly I just want everyone to go there so they can get lots and lots of business and expand to SoCal, because I have been craving it ever since. Yes, it's off the strip. Get over it. It's beyond worth it.  If I were to take off stars, it would basically be because no breakfast can compare and now that I know food this good exists I will forever be a spoiled brat saying, \"Well, it's good, but it's no BabyStacks...\"  Thanks a lot for ruining my palette for life with your deliciousness.",

My girl mentioned how cold it was to the waitress but being a robot she barely acknowledged we were at the table much less what my girl had said. Weird vibe aside, for the price this was average food. Almost remarkably average actually. The pancakes were ordinary and the eggs were very well done almost plastic like (you know the type). Bacon was also burned. The wait was short for the food but once the food came the experience was further \"enhanced\" by the sound of the woman behind the counter throwing what must have been every piece of silverware they had into a bin. Tranquil.  She looked so pleased too while doing this (smell that, that's sarcasm). Waitress came back once to bring the check and finally ask if we needed anything, had to track down someone else before that for a coffee refill. Wanted to like the place, close to where we live, my girl thought the name was cute, just didn't live up to expectations much less the average corner diner experience.",

I had the carrot cake pancake stack (short - I have no idea how hungry you would have to be to consume the full stack!) and a side of the Portugese sausage.  The pancakes had a great flavor, not too sweet, and the cream cheese syrup was also great, but I wish there was more of it as it didn't cover all three pancakes in the short stack.  The Portugese sausage had good flavor (and was a generous portion) I am not sure it went with the pancakes I ordered, but I wanted to try something unusual - the sausage is kind of like kielbasa I would say, or perhaps a chorizo.  The prices of the pancakes were very reasonable and I would go back and try some of the other options on the menu.",

Again, they were all very good, but they don't really live up to the hype... but then again, how could they?  The burrito was also good but nothing special.  I will say that the serving sizes were much smaller than they appear in all the pictures. Not that important to me, but just thought that that was interesting.  Service was excellent.",

The garlic rice is quite something, but you better LOVE garlic because it's strong. Like I said- I'd try it again and would probably get something more characteristically Hawaiian- like some sort of spam scramble. I suspect that they get that right.",

It was about 10 minutes away from The Strip and BabyStacks is a small casual cafe in a local plaza. There were so many choices to choose from, but I had to try their famed Red Velvet Pancakes. I'm usually not a huge fan of Red Velvet since I've had enough as a dessert and I find it usually a bit too sweet with their cream cheese frosting. I was a bit afraid that it would be too sweet for pancakes, but I was wrong. BabyStacks Cafe was the first and perhaps the best red velvet pancakes I have ever had. The pancakes was not too sweet and its syrup was just right that didn't left me feeling like I already indulged a load of sugar for the morning. I got the short stack which was enough for me for 3 pancakes. It's affordable with entrees costing less than $10! BabyStacks Cafe is a casual cafe that seems to be known within the locals, so it didn't felt like it was all touristy. Their service was great and the waitress welcomed me as a newcomer which I thought it was a pleasant experience at BabyStacks. BabyStacks is definitely bookmarked for my future visits to Vegas!",

From my husband: While the Red velvet pancakes are a novel idea, the Juevos rancheros cannot be eaten without a fork and a knife (it would be nicer to have the tortillas on the side). The hash browns could be more crispy.  Five stars for presentation and service .",

The Husband and I were very excited to try this place given their good reviews and their amazing sounding menu. When we arrived, it was pretty empty, but I guess that's expected on a Monday and only a couple days before Christmas. We were seated and I must have spent 30 minutes trying to make up my mind on what to get...it was a pretty big decision after all. Finally, I decided to get what the Husband called 'the coward's breakfast' (since I just avoided making a decision by getting one of everything) which consisted of 2 eggs, rice with garlic/onion stuffs, and 2 hazelnut pancakes (I couldn't make up my mind....I call it the Most Winning Breakfast...but that's me!). He got the orange creamsicle pancakes. The pancakes were tiny, but filling. Mine had got od flavor, but were served kind of cold. The rice was not as delicious as I thought...it was garlicky, but didn't have any flavor beyond that. The eggs were cooked well. The husband liked his pancakes, but I didn't care for them. The service was attentive. Overall, it was fine, but definitely not deserving of the raves I had heard....just another breakfast place IMO.",

There was only one dish that wasn't as good as it could be, but that was probably how I ordered it.  You can tell that the ownership is Hawaiian by the menu and the decor.  Red Velvet pancakes:  TO DIE FOR!  The cream cheese syrup is super sweet so use sparingly.  They are so wonderful though!  Carrot cake pancakes:  Very good, but tough to live up to the red velvet that every other review praises.    The chicken and chili omelet:  very well balanced, but a bit larger then I really needed with the pancakes, we can not finish both and always have extras.   Honey toast: flavor very good, this is a good version of french toast and I would recommend it for anyone who is looking for a sweet breakfast dish.  I can not remember the exact name but this is what I ordered incorrectly: the skillet of eggs, potatoes, and pork with salsa on the side was a bit dry. This can be either ordered as a skillet or as an omelet (opt for the omelet).  the ingredients were good.  Overall, these were great meals and I have recommended BabyStacks to friends in the culinary industry.  This is a big compliment.",

I got a skillet, husband got a benedict, neither one of us got pancakes since we try to eat low-carb these days.  The portion size was just adequate for me, husband left hungry.  I felt like the plating was designed to hide how little meat was on your plate.  The coffee was not bad, but I noticed they are quicker to refill at first than later, they pretty clearly were trying to get people to finish eating and leave quickly.  Even though there were empty tables around as we were eating, and nowhere near closing time.  That, along with the spartan, crammed-in atmosphere, tacky signs, and lack of warmth, is a bit off-putting.  I would probably come here again, since the food wasn't bad, but there are so many decent cheap breakfast places around the neighborhood that I might never bother.  Rather eat somewhere less stingy.",

There was a soda lid on the floor by our table and a fly that kept landing on my arm, but let's be honest, you're not here for the ambiance, you're here for their amazing selection of pancakes.   Those babycakes...whoa. So good. I would suggest starting out with a short stack bc the sheer amount of sugar in these things will start to get to ya, but holy is it worth it. These bad boys are delicious. I had the pleasure of taking down a few cinnabun style today and I'm thinking of going back for more. Sweet icing on the top, cinnamon sprinkled throughout and just a few crumbled nuts on top, it was just like eating a cinnamon bun (Costanza style), but you get to dip it in syrup. Win.   Not a sweets person and looking for eggs? Yea, they got that. They omelets are pretty standard and the hashbrowns are crunchy and not over-salted. You won't be wow-ed, you won't be disappointed. You WILL get jealous of your friends eating amazing pancakes.",

The waiter made sure our cups were filled w our coffee. The place was clean, my party didn't wait long. We came early to beat the crowd.

The menu is just the right size with enough diversity to please most everyone, but small enough to ensure high quality with every dish.    Keep in mind they won't seat partial parties.  The original location on north Buffalo is very small so plan accordingly.  If you love breakfast, definitely give them a try!",

My daughter got a breakfast with hash browns, eggs, red velvet pancakes and bacon. Both dishes were awesome + priced very reasonably. We both ate there for $18 including tax and 25% tip.    Our waitress was awesome and service from all staff was amazing. Can't think of a single thing to complain about!   Can't wait to go back and get the chili!",

Although, after we got seated and placed our orders, we did not get our drinks until 10 minutes later. My friend and I were wondering why it took so long to receive waters all around.   After waiting for 25 minutes we got our food. I ordered the Baby Chick Skillet for $7. It wasn't bad but it wasn't that great either. The potatoes were a bit soggy. I ordered over easy eggs to go with it and they were pretty runny. I probably won't get this again.   BUT, Babystacks is known for their pancakes so I thought I'd get some. Their pancakes are the reason why I give this place 4 stars. I ordered their new \"Cookies n cream\" pancakes. They were amazing! The chocolate pancakes were cooked just right and were even better drenched in sweet cream sauce! My friend also gave me her lemon ricotta pancakes and they were refreshing! These crepe like pancakes with powdered sugar and sweet cream sauce were awesome.   Overall, I recommend sticking to the pancakes over the food! I bet you'll enjoy them!",

I got lucky on my first visit and only waited a few minutes, but on my second visit, we waited nearly an hour :(  Between the two visits:  Highlights were the red velvet pancakes (yum all around), adobo fried rice omelette and corned beef hash w/ garlic rice  Be warned, the garlic rice isn't just a hint of garlic, it's full force garlic, which was fine by me.   Lemon ricotta pancakes had great flavor, but the texture was soggy, which is why I probably wouldn't order it again.  Being from Hawaii, I love places that remind me of home, which Babystacks does. If you are able to visit them on a weekday, do it! Or have a snack before trying them on a weekend/holiday.",

We showed up @ about 11:00 am on a weds & the place was already humming.  When we left an hour later, there was a sizable crowd waiting for tables...the weekends must be a mad house here.  I had the Kalua pig Benedict @ $9.75 and it was delicious.  My friend & I shared a short Red velvet pancake ($8.95 full, $5.75 short).  We loved the food.  Our server was fantastic.

The cowboy omelette was just ok to me but the tarimisu pancakes would be perfect for the less of a sweet tooth. Oh and by the way go with their home potatoes instead of the hash browns or fries.

Haven't tried their two other locations in Vegas but hopefully they are just as good food and service as the Flamingo/Buffalo location.",

    "text": "I finally got around too trying more of the menu at BabyStacks Cafe and again not disappointed! I tried me some Adobo Fried Rice and course had too get me some Red Velvet Pancakes. If not going too BabyStacks getting some Red Velvet Pancakes that borderline atrocity too pancake nation! lol! The Adobo Fried Rice was awesome! Who would have thought just roll out almost crepe like consistency egg batter load it up with delicious fried rice, fold it like burrito, and dam you got breakfast burrito from heaven. The fried rice has SO much flavor no need too add anything else and it huge size not getting cheated out of anything. The fried rice by itself could have big bowl everyday its that ONO! The pancakes no need too review that one. If never had it need too get some...  The service is always great my server was punctual came too asking for my drink order, and return soon after taking my breakfast order. It does get busy but tend too go places odd time beat the rush. My drink was never empty. It not often go out for breakfast but by far my favorite place for some good breakfast.",

    "text": "Came here looking for a decent breakfast in Vegas, and was not disappointed.    I had the chicken fried steak and eggs, with bacon pancakes.  The CFS had a good texture.  The gravy was good.  The eggs were a little underdone for \"Over Medium\", but that's up to interpretation.  But enough of this.  This is a pancake joint, so let's talk about those.  The bacon pancakes were very good.  They had bacon in them, and on them.  They were springy and resilient without being tough.  Not too soft or hard, but just about perfect.  They were flavorful, and very tasty.    The service was good.  The waitress pleasant.  Everything was pretty quick.  The cost was decent.  Were I a local, I'd probably come here often.  About the only thing that I can ding them on, and the reason this isn't a five star review, is that the coffee is not great.  It's on par with the other places I've been in Vegas, but not great.  I'm a coffee snob, and can't handle what tastes like something that came pre-ground in pre-measured bags.",

Soon as we got seated, our server approached us with our drink orders.  Then a few minutes later, our food orders.  All in all, I would say the service was okay. Not too bad, but not the greatest either. He got all of our orders correct, and even left a few napkins here and there. Considering the fact that they were busy, I could understand why he looked a bit flustered. The food was really good, like always..which is why we come here. I would say I would come back, I love their banana pancakes and Orange creamsicle pancakes! Those two are definitely a must!",

    "text": "Popular breakfast place in town, best known for their variety of pancake styles.   Take note ! They only seat after ENTIRE party is there. And they get pretty busy during breakfast or lunch time (only open for breakfast and lunch, for obvious reasons)  Been here a few times. Various friends and family. So got to try different things.   Like a normal breakfast place, they offer a variety Omelettes, pancakes, etc. They have a slight Hawaiian influence so you'll see things like kalua pork, or bbq pork, or Portuguese sausage on the menu.But the most talked about, and hyped, is their Red Velvet Pancakes. For those who dont know, red velvet is more known for the cake. Bright to dark red cake flavored with cocoa with a cream cheese icing, So essentially, simply a chocolate cake, without the overload of chocolate.   My first time here, was with one other friend. We had tried the red velvet, as well as the banana cream pancake. Prior to this, i had been very sick of pancakes because one year, my friends and I decided to go around to different iHops on international pancake day, and eat free pancakes.... that killed it for me for a few years. So traditional normal pancakes, definitely a no go for me ! I was eager to try these new pancakes with different flavors though.   At BabyStacks, they offer their pancakes in full stacks or half stacks, and their pancakes are smaller than the normal ones you see.  Maybe like 4-5\" in diameter vs the plate sized ones.   Red Velvet Pancakes - As said before, its red, but essentially a lighter chocolate pancake with cream cheese icing and whipped cream. Its pretty good. Not what it was hyped up to be (maybe im not much of a dessert person anyway) but its not bad. I still do recommend people who hasn't tried it, to try it. Light chocolatey flavor with a not too heavy cream cheese icing.   Banana Cream Pie Pancake - Traditional pancake with what you'd find in a banana cream pie so sliced bananas, a banana cream, and whipped cream. The first time i tried it, it was surprisingly amazing, Originally being a lover of banana cream pie (to the extent of not being a dessert lover... if that makes sense), this had sparked my interest in pancakes again.   Overall, nice place to go for breakfast. Variety of stuff to order, not only pancakes.",

    "text": "Nearly 7 months since my last visit to this specific BabyStacks. So, an updated review was in need.   Whether you're local or visiting, you have to try Babystacks at least once.  My opinion, still one of the best breakfast joints in town.  You can still get your eggs, bacon, and hash browns at BabyStacks.  But let's be honest, it's all about their stacks.  You can't go wrong with most of their pancakes and it's their Red Velvet that they're known for. Other favorites for me include their Portuguese Sausage, Loco Moco (IKR?), Garlic Rice, Biscuits/Gravy, Macadamia Stack, and their Adobo Fried Rice.   Regarding this specific location, I have to say it's the best one to go to if you're looking for less of a wait and a bigger location.  At this location, you're almost seated immediately.  However, I still think the North Buffalo location is better.  Maybe I'm biased, maybe I'm just loyal, but I think the food taste just a tad better at the north location. But please, continue to go the south location so that I don't have to wait as long at the north one.   TIP:  On my most recent visit, I did something that I never do. I got a full stack of their Red Velvet pancakes. A short stack is usually good enough, especially if you're just complimenting a main dish.  I don't believe in wasting food so I cleaned my plate. I don't think I ate for at least another 5 hours after.",

    "text": "PANCAKE LOVERS UNITE!!!!  So so many different delicious options for pancakes! There are a ton of unique flavors of pancakes offered such as banana cream pie, cinnabun, etc. Our table ordered full stacks of red velvet and s'mores pancakes to share. In my opinion, the red velvet pancakes were a little overrated because they were kind of dry unless you covered it with whip cream and cream cheese frosting... But the s'mores pancakes were delicious especially the part of the batter that had chocolate. It was like having dessert for breakfast. Those of you with a sweet tooth will be especially pleased. :)  I'd definitely recommend taking the drive off the strip to come here if you want some good breakfast! Friendly and attentive service. They're only open until three pm so they specialize in breakfast foods and you can sleep in a little and go get brunch after noon.   Babystacks has savory breakfast items, but I think you MUST order pancakes here at least to share with everyone at the table. My friends had been here before and did not recommend the adobo fried rice that seemed to be a highlight in many other yelp reviews. They said it was gross. This place has a lot of islander (Hawaiian) inspired breakfast items such as a spam scramble or loco moco. The boyfriend and I shared the kalua pig benedict and it was tasty! It was the favorite entree among everyone at our table. The pork was super soft and cooked perfectly, and it went well with the muffin, hollandaise sauce, and poached egg.   I can't wait to come back. There's still so many more pancakes and entrees that I want to try!",

There was a party of 2 ahead of us and one party of 2 that came after us. Both parties were sat before us. We sat on the bench and waited. We were eventually sat at a table right by the lobby. A homeless man came in and ordered fried rice which was fine. He sat at the table we were eventually seated at to wait. He was asked to wait in the lobby. We sat down and looked at the menu. The host came by and offered beverages. I asked for a glass of juice and never got it. We were still ok until the homeless man got his fried rice, ate it in the lobby and then put his dirty container on our table and left it. The host did pick it up but didn't wipe the table.  I finally was able to get someone's attention. I explained to her what happened and she let us move tables because the man asked for more rice. She did move us, and then we did get our order taken. I ordered bacon and it never came but was on the bill. We just paid for it. It was busy and we wanted to leave. The biscuits and gravy were some of the best I'd ever had but could have been warmer (flavor was spot on though), red velvet pancakes were amazing. My friend had the veggie skillet and loved it. Side of Kahlua pig was amazing too. The food came out in stages but it was busy, it was very good and our server was extremely nice and accommodating. Host needs some serious work!!! We will go back but to be honest we will try a different location!",

Super delicious make sure you order milk though because they are super sweet.",

Also had a skillet, which was very good as well (although it could use a little less salt).  And just as important, the coffee is nice and strong.  A good reason to go back to Las Vegas.  Please open a store in Dublin, CA (we sure could use a good breakfast joint here)!",

They quickly came to deal with it and still charged me for my meal. My total bill was $10, I can't believe that they actually charged me after finding a bug in my food. I did not cause a scene and I immediately stopped eating and my daughter did as well. The manager didn't even come to me  about the bug rather another waitress, when I went to pay I calmly and extremely quietly stated I was not paying for it and the manager then came and disputed me paying for this meal. The waitress we had was very good. Needless to say when they handed me the bill I then made a fuss. Gave them a chance to remedy the issue without me causing as scene but I feel because I was so calm about it they tried to take advantage of it. I'm sure this rarely happens but be careful what you bite into at this location!",

When i go to breakfast places, I try to steer clear of ordering stuff i can make at home...spam and eggs, Portuguese sausage and eggs, etc etc.  I always try to go for stuff that I can't make or would take too much effort to make.  Pancakes are not hard to make but the creativity that baby stacks has come up with forced me to order them, lol!  We had the velvet pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the corned beef hash.    red velvet pancakes: they were good, not spectacular like most people here say, but definitely good.  They came with a cream cheese sauce and I noticed most people were pouring the entire thing on their pancakes, lol.  Yeah, they were good but all of it was too sweet for me.   The banana cream pie pancakes were really good.  banana slices, a banana type sauce, almonds and a whipped cream that tasted like it was infused with banana.  If they only added some chocolate too! mmmm.........  The corned beef hash said that it was homemade on the menu but it looked like and tasted like the canned stuff.  I think the best corned beef hash still belongs to Black Bear Diner...  Overall a great experience and we will be back.  We're looking forward to trying the kalua pig benedict, chicken adobo omelet, etc.    p.s. for any Hawaii Peeps out there, their banana cream pie pancakes tasted exactly like the banana mac pancakes from BOOTS N KIMOS in Kailua!  I think the chef here used to work there or something, lol!",

We had actually planned on going to the donut shop next door, but their selections was lackluster to say the least.   The restaurant was PACKED when we got in there.  Every table except one two seater was full.  It was too crowded to easily walk through, but in had a pleasant vibe.  It must be said I DO NOT like pancakes.  My husband ordered cinnabon pancakes and I ordered pumpkin pancakes with a side of homefries.  Ordering was a challenge as the employees were standing in front of the specials board and we couldn't read it.  Breakfast came out in a timely manner.  The pancakes were smaller than I expected for the price.  The syrups that came out were also very small.  We bother requested regular syrup on the side.  The white icing style syrup that came with mine was AWESOME and the highlight of the trip.  My husband was disappointed with his meal bc the pancakes were too small and stacked poorly on the plate so the syrup ran off the side.  The homefries were good, similar in flavor to the Egg and I.  We are not likely to go back to this place...  just not a good value for the money",

The wait was 20 minutes or so on a Saturday afternoon which wasn't too bad, and for once, we were at a restaurant where my in-laws being white, were the ones who were outnumbered!! Muahahahaha.   The atmosphere is very casual, and not bad for a brunch place. I ordered the Huntington omelette and I wish I heeded Alana's review saying to stay away from it. It was pretty miserable. Everyone else at the table loved their food, but mine was by far the worst. An omelette with probably 2? or 1 1/2? pieces of bacon cut up into the omelette with nearly non-existent cheddar cheese mixed into the eggs, and half of an over-riped avocado slices on top. I will NEVER order that again. I got the specialty Almond Joy pancakes & I guess this was my fault, but I didn't expect a chocolate batter, because I am not a big fan of chocolate cakes or chocolate pastries, but obviously, this came with chocolate pancakes, with slices almonds, coconut, and whipped cream. They weren't THAT sweet, but I wish I ordered something else.  My husband got the country fried steak which I tried a piece of and was very tasty. He ordered banana cream pie pancakes which were the best of the table. My children had s'mores pancakes which came with marshmallows and graham cracker crumbles. I didn't try them, but they were engulfed in seconds since I try to limit their sugar intake. This was certainly a treat for them. They also had the breakfast combo with eggs and bacon. The bacon was great! Thick and perfectly cooked to a crisp. The carrot cake pancakes that my mother in law ordered were a flop. WAY too heavy and cake-like rather than light and fluffy like pancakes should be. I don't know if I would be back as I already have a favorite brunch spot, and we seldom go to brunch, but I can see the appeal of specialty pancakes and I would say to stick to those, and stay away from the Huntington omelette.",

The cream cheese syrup is perfect. I'm excited to come back to try the country benedict and the cookie butter french toast.  One thing I tried but wasn't crazy about was the s'mores pancakes. The whole unmelted marshmallows on top were obtrusive, and the crust crumbles on top didn't taste right. I'd rather see graham crackers incorporated in the batter with lots of chocolate chips, and marshmallow cream on top.  That aside, I thought it was a nice little diner with plenty of interesting delicious food to try. A great break from the strip.",

Thats pretty normal here to be busy so expect a slight wait if you have parties of more than four.   Lets get to the must orders: Pancakes - Red Velvet (if you like it, not my favorite but a guest favorite, get sauce on side if you don't like things too sweet) - Banana cream Pie - LOVE IT, but I always get the sauce on the side since its too much for me - Chocolate Chip - LOVE IT Crepes -Solid Choice, but you can also get at buffets so, usually I pass on this one Adobo Fried Rice Omelette - Delicious! Must try Loco Moco - Good gravy, not as good as in hawaii, but you can add garlic rice here which I recommend!  They also have usual breakfast items like Ham, bacon, corned beef hash, etc. These are all not bad items, but also you can also get them anywhere and they do a find job of making these dishes. I only talked about the ones above because they're my favorites and you can't get at too many other places.  The plan of attack is to SHARE a shortstack and something else, unless your meal already comes with pancakes, in which UPGRADE them to your liking.",

    "text": "On my family's \"annual\" trip to Las Vegas from Cali, we stopped by this place on glowing recommendations from my sister before we headed out of town...we figure we might as well get some good food before losing the rest of our wages.  It was late Friday morning and the place was doing brisk business. We waited for about 10-15 minutes (party of six) and were seated with our drinks taken care of somewhat promptly. All was well...then we placed our orders...that's when my frustration with this place grew. I base my reviews on the quality of the food first, then the service, then ambiance. With regards to service, I want to see that my glass of water is refilled before being emptied and not having to summon a waiter to refill the glass...and for a breakfast place to ensure my cup of coffee is promptly refilled. Well, the coffee wasn't refilled before I could see the bottom of the cup. On top of that, the waitress got our orders messed up once the food finally arrived after a 35 minute wait! 35 minutes! Waiting for our food for 35 minutes from the time we ordered! Unacceptable. The only redeeming quality was that the food was actually pretty good. Everyone on our table liked what they had and were willing to overlook the long wait...I wasn't. If it wasn't for the decent food, I would have given this place 2 stars or 1 star. Our party tried Rick's Adobo Fried Rice, Portuguese Sausage and Eggs, and Velvet pancakes, among other things  Really, BabyStacks...35-minute wait for breakfast food? What, you had to coax the chickens out back to push a little harder for some eggs?",

    "text": "Been meaning to try BabyStacks for sometime, but we finally got over there to give it a try on Saturday afternoon. We were seated at the counter since the tables were full. We didn't mind it. We looked over the menu and the husband chose the Mexican Skillet ($9.95) with Red Velvet pancakes ($1.50). I went with a short order of Banana Cream Pie pancakes ($5.75). Everything was really delicious. The skillet was the perfect blend of savory flavors, the red velvet pancakes followed like dessert and the banana cream pie pancakes weren't overly sweet - thankfully, I was nervous. It was a nice treat. Our server was new and still learning the ropes, but very friendly and attentive. We'll be back.",

Red Velvet pancakes are perfection every time and I don't usually like sweets in the am but these are the exception! Also love the Huntington skillet with avocado yum as well as the Portuguese sausage which is a little spicy but yummy! Can never go wrong with spam and eggs either lots of favorites you should go!!! The only reason I give 4 Stars and not 5 is because this location has terrible air flow in the summer I don't like to Go to the flamingo location! Beside all that the food is always on point...you may have a long wait on weekends and also they won't seat incomplete parties so make sure everyone's on time!!!",

Don't worry, despite the diverse nature of the menu, you can still order traditional pancakes, bacon and eggs, and regular omelets...but why would you want to?? With dishes like the adobo rice omelette and the Kalua pig benedict you should definitely give your taste buds something to write home about. Visit this place and you will not be disspointed.  Hot tip: if you come here for breakfast, be ready to wait a few minutes for a place to sit. This place is always crowded",

    "text": "Flew into Vegas and my Cal pal suggested we have brunch at BabyStacks Cafe. What's this place? Yummy, delicious breakfast food! I had the Nutella Crepes with half strawberries and banana with fresh whip cream with a side of Canadian bacon, and my friend ordered the Honey Toast with a side of turkey bacon. My crepes were not thin, more pancake-like rolled into what looked like a crepe, and my Canadian bacon was way too salty. However, Katrina's breakfast was to DIE for!!!! The honey toast, or (aka French Toast) were two humongous thick slices of sweet bread with a large dollop of whip cream sprinkled with cinnamon. I actually wanted to eat her breakfast instead of mine! LOL The portions were large and hearty. Their overall menu selections were abundant, from pancakes, crepes, omelets, eggs/bacon, lots of sides, and a few Filipino dishes.  I decided to take my family there before we left Vegas, so my second trip was just as good as the first. This time I ordered the Honey Toast (delectable!) and my family ordered: red velvet pancakes, strawberries and cream pancakes, and corned beef hash with garlic rice and an over easy egg. The garlic rice was so-so as they put too many onion slices in it. Be prepared to order a full or half stack of pancakes if you're hungry and a sweet tooth.  In terms of service, we arrived at a busy time, around 11:00 AM so we had to wait 15-20 minutes before we were seated. The waitress was very pleasant and replenished our coffee mugs. The restaurant is small and gets very busy, so if you go, go early. Their hours are Mon-Fri 7:00 AM - 2:00 PM, and Sat-Sun 7-3PM. Their prices are a bit steep, but makes up for the quality of the fresh food. You must eat there!",

The food was amazing, and we ended up taking some of the extra pancakes home for breakfast the next day.  Might have gone overboard on the number of short stacks we got, but it was definitely worth it.  There was a long wait for parties more than 2 or 3, but since it was only my wife and I we got seated right away (got lucky, I guess...).  Only down side was that they were pretty expensive (after tip our bill was almost $40 for breakfast), so this won't be an \"every other week\" place for us, but more of a \"once a month/every 6 weeks\" kind of place for us.  4 Stars for this breakfast establishment.  PS--We would pick this place over IHOP if that is any help in comparison of food quality.",

Hubby got the Portuguese sausage, eggs, garlic rice with a side of buttermilk pancakes and he loved it! I got the eggs, sausage links and upgraded my buttermilk pancakes to bacon pancakes. I wouldn't get the sausage links as they were greasy and nothing special. Bacon pancakes were ok but I would prefer bacon waffles (at Hash House a go-go). I would try a different kind of specialty pancakes if we ever make it back here. My daughter got the S'mores pancakes and she loved them! Prices are decent. Overall, a pretty good experience!",

However, we didn't have to wait 45 min to get a table and it was on a Saturday around 10ish. Since I was on this side of town and had a groupon for this place...why not? It only took 10 minutes to get our table. Good thing we came at the perfect time because the people started to arrive and the wait was 30 to 40 min. The place was a little bit larger than the other location.   It took about 15 minutes to be greeted by our server. I ordered the ranchero omelet since I haven't tried it, with the red velvet pancakes. My daughter ordered the LJ's scramble with the red velvet pancake. Her pancake took an additional 10 minutes to come out after we got our food. The ranchero omelet was pretty good with a kick of hotness due to the green salsa. The red velvet pancakes is still my favorite because it's not too sweet...dessert for breakfast is just the perfect way to end your meal or start it.   Other flavored pancakes to try is the Rocky Road, S'mores, and White chocolate macadamia, Lemon ricotta, and Strawberry. They are all very yummy and will not disappoint you.",

The pancakes it seems are their speciality as they have everything from whole wheat pancakes to red velvet.  And the food portions are HUGE!  The pancakes were great.

Amazing, the eggs and the pancake dishes we tried were awesome. The red velvet looks like it would be too sweet, but was not.  Delicious. The bananas foster pancakes were a bit too sweet for us, but still delicious. We will be back!!!",

I found this place a few years ago before a trip to Vegas, and let me tell you this the only place we come for breakfast.  This is our first stop when we come to Vegas and our last stop before we head home. This place is worth the drive all the way from Cali. Everything we have tried we have LOVED! I have mentioned this place and brought our friends and family and they keep on going back to babystacks. Their specialty pancakes are to die for from the red velvet to the peanut butter and jelly. They are all amazing. And who would of thought to put carnitas in an omelet?? Everyone is so friendly and very attentive. If you come to Vegas make sure to stop by Babystacks you will NOT be disappointed and you will want to keep going back (just like me )",

They are the best in town, I have had them at a few other places and they don't measure up to the ones here, not even close!  But why the 3 start rating do you ask? The pregnant waitress is completely rude. My boyfriend casually asked \"Can you split the check please?\" We were with a group of friends. And she says \"No, don't you see the multiple signs up? We don't split checks\" What the hell! I have worked in customer service for 6 years of my life and I would NEVER talk to a customer like that. The proper way to answer the question is \"I do apologize but we don't split checks, I am so sorry for the inconvenience.\"   If you hate your job or don't like people you should get out of the customer service industry. People need to learn to treat customers with more respect and speak to them with MANNERS!   That last time we ate here she left a bitter taste in my mouth. I probably won't return to this location ever again, I hope the other locations have the decency to hire people who have manners.",

On top of that its very unprofessional. Its not my fault you signed up to work at job you don't feel like doing.  Aside from an unwelcoming rude greeting from the waitress sitting at the bar during work hours..our waitress Ally was nice and helpful.   Food was good we had their red.velvet pancakes and the huntington which  was bomb!! Price is worth it! The red velvet with the dipping sauce was perfectly sweet.

Excellent customer service, reasonable prices and delicious food. A unique concept that is a nice break from your traditional diner food cafe. They offer Filipino and Hawaiian style breakfast and lunch specialties, along with American breakfast classics. They are also known for their Red Velvet Pancakes and Adobo Fried Rice.   I went in for breakfast and I had the eggs with Portuguese sausage and home fries. The sausage was well cooked, the fries were crispy with a good  amount of seasoning, and my eggs were cooked perfectly to my specifications of over easy.   My special came with butter milk pancakes or the option to upgrade to a specialty pancake. I decided to indulge and went for the lemon ricotta crepe style pancakes. Oh my...so darn good!! They were served with a lemon glaze syrup sauce and dusted with powdered sugar. Perfect size, not too sweet and the lemon glaze had a nice tang to it.   I will definitely come back, as I would like to try their bananas foster pancakes on my next visit. They just sound so heavenly and my waitress highly recommended them.  I highly recommend BabyStacks Cafe. They have several locations throughout the Las Vegas valley. I dined at the Buffalo and Durango location.",

Then the waitress refused to take our food order and only wanted our drinks because she had \"other tables she had to take their orders first\". She wasn't able to refill coffee in a timely manner. Our food took a really long time. I was so embarrassed.  I came back with my aunt hoping they just had a bad day and it happened again, they sat down a bunch of people that walked in after us. Her toddler was hungry and getting cranky. Finally a nice family that clearly seen us sitting their before them was about to be seated and told the host to seat us first because we were there first.

They're always busy, and there's never a time when we came where they weren't. They don't seat incomplete parties nor do they split checks so be prepared (there's always Venmo or Cash App). Anyways, the wait is usually anywhere between 10 to 30 mins, which really isn't that bad. The wait gets us quite excited because just thinking of what we will order from the many different items on their menu can take a while to decide. But overall, whatever you choose.. This place will definitely fill you up! The servers are quite attentive, sometimes there's a rush so once in a while you need to get their attention, but other than that, you'll feel satisfied after taking those first couple of bites of food.  My friends and I always order something savory and upgrade to one of their specialty short stacks, which is definitely plentiful.  Lastly, we love the island fusion and music! Having lived in Maui for a few years, and having a step-father raised on the island of Oahu, it definitely brings me back to a sunny day at the beach.",

Chocolate pancakes with a slight coffee taste, chocolate syrup, almonds and whipped cream. It was so good!  My daughter got the Nutella crepes and they weren't great. Messy to eat and the Nutella was so thick it was just too much. My hubby got the chili loco moco. I was hesitant about that. But the chili is very tasty. I would order that next time.

You're going to ruin your shirt or need to wear a bib, but then again I am a messy eater so you can't take me anywhere nice and my clothes get ruined fast. My brother visited me and he had the bananas foster pancakes, he thought they were great! I have tried other pancakes they have, lemon ricotta are strong runner up. Myself I don't like red velvet that much, but it never fails that I see someone order them and they always seem to be in the middle of a foodgasm. The staff is always friendly!",

The service was friendly, the place had a good islander vibe (reminded me of Hawaii), and the menu had something for everyone from many varieties of pancakes, French toast, omelettes, and breakfast combos. As for the food, well let me just say it was amazingly delicious!!!   I ordered the spam, eggs, and potatoes with pancakes. And of course I upgraded those bad boys to the banana cream pancakes. My eyes were definitely bigger than my stomach and I wasn't able to finish. But I had to try both. The spam juicy and cooked just right, the eggs were done the way I like, and the potatoes were yummy. Everything had good flavor and paired well together. The banana cream pancakes was so rich and like a dream you don't want to end. It tasted just like pie, with a buttermilk pancake crust. Sooo good, and worth trying.   My wife ordered the shredded pork and rice omelette with a short stack of rocky road pancakes. She loved it and couldn't finish her meal as well. Had some bites and I must say what we both ordered was flavorful and a good filling breakfast.  Good portion breakfast plates, delicious pancakes, good coffee, friendly service, and worth trying.",

Not only were the toppings on the pancakes delicious the pancakes themselves were warm and fluffy while melting in your mouth. The service was great as well, the ladies there are all kind and professional. I ended up coming here two mornings in a row because I couldn't get enough. Make sure to get there early right when they open or later before they close to avoid the crowd. Will definetly be coming back here when I'm back in Vegas.",

She could've smiled once or even made eye contact. She did the bare minimum.   All in all, my past experiences here have been great and that outweighs this one time. Everyone has a bad day I guess.

The pancake itself is not overly sweet or thick at all, has amazing flavor (really tastes like red velvet, and has incredible delicious whipped cream with the most satisfying chocolate shavings that's  sprinkled on top. SO GOOD!!   I also ordered the Kuala Pig Eggs Benedict with hash browns, but i just thought it was just okay. There wasn't really much flavor than I have expected.  My boyfriend got their Kuala Pig Grilled Cheese with hasbrowns and it was okay as well imo. Just a regular grilled cheese with Kuala Pig.   But yeah, overall definitely stick to the pancakes because it's soo delicious!!",

Let's start off with the service...I personally did not find the workers to be friendly. The hostess was very pushy when asking where the rest of my party was when they were right outside of the door! I only found one waitress to be friendly (I forgot to ask for her name) As for the food we got the red velvet pancakes, adobo fried rice, and Mac salad. Their red velvet was just ok, I honestly think IHOP's is better. It just seemed a little cakey if you ask me. The adobo fried rice was just ok and a bit on the salty side. As for the Mac salad it had no taste, it was bland. I would rather have Aloha kitchens Mac salad. So with that being said I won't be going back anytime soon.",

It was a bit distasteful and didn't make the best first impression. No split checks, no seating partial parties, no this, that, and the other. So many rules everywhere it distracts from the ambiance of a laid back breakfast/lunch cafe. Anyways. The food looked great that they brought out to everyone else but I guess I ordered the most lackluster dish on the menu, a turkey club and a side salad. It was something I could have made at home and made better at that but it was good. Just nothing even remotely special or unique to their menu. It was literally deli turkey, avocado and a tomato on two slabs of sara lee. I guess next time I give them a try (I am not opposed to trying it again) I will have to order one of the skillets, or pancake creations it seemed like those were served up with a bit more pride and creativity. Service was adequate but nothing that stood out or made me have a positive reaction to the service portion. Just average across the board.",

Also, we both never eat just sweet things for brrfst, so he ordered country fried steak and eggs w/ hash browns and coffee, I ordered bacon/eggs/hash browns with coffee. I usually won't order something like country fried steak unless a place is known for it, but after I tastes his, i was sad i didn't order that. Mine was good, but his was awesome. So round two (we've been twice in 2 wks-bought groupon NOW deals both times)-this time i got the special-orange creamsicle pancakes with corn beef hash (another thing I typically won't order unless they're known for it)...hubby got an omelet with red velvets again :) My pancakes=TDF. they tasted like those pillsbury rolls in a can you twist to pop open then cook in the over...comes with a orangey frosting? these taste like those!!!!  My corn beef hash,sadly was eh. whatever i just won't order it next time!  Btw-this place has a bit of an island theme to it-they serve kahlua pork, side of steamed rice as substitute for toast, potatoes, etc, and various other islandy things. If you dig breakfast joints, don't miss this one, or its counterpart baby cakes. they are both on buffalo, just one north and one south!",

But def not! I coulda made the garlic rice waaayyy better at home! It was like it was drenched in oil and they just threw it on the plate...as for the \"so called\" red velvet pancakes shit is disgusting tastes like pure flower which be covered in their \"cheese syrup\" if you want the REAL red velvet pancakes i suggest going to Rise & Shine...nuff said",

    "text": "As far as I'm concerned breakfast is the best meal of the day. I love funky spots like this one. I've been here a couple of times and have tried a savory dish and a pancake dish every time. THE GOOD: the pancakes are amazing! Not only are they cooked flawlessly, but there are some creative toppings. Red velvet, banana fosters, cinnamon bun & s'mores. Hands down best pancakes I've had in years. THE BAD: service isn't that attentive. There wasn't any sugar on my table and it took almost 10 mins to get the attention of a server. Also we weren't pressed on how we liked our half uneaten entrees. Which leads me to... THE UGLY: neither anyone I've gone with or myself have ever gotten a savory dish that was good. The Kailua pig Benedict's sounded great, but I was eventually grateful they don't give you much pig. Pretty flavorless. This last time I tried the chili loco moco special. Horrible! Hamburger was dry, egg over cooked and it was served over dry jasmine rice. Why would you ever do loco moco over jasmine rice? Bottom line if you want pancakes come here. If they had been average I would have given this place 1 star.",

If you can withstand the wait, you will get seated very closely with other customers. We like our privacy when eating, not listening to our neighbors conversations.   Then I wasn't very hungry, so I saw the kids meals were available. It never stated anywhere on the menu that you are not able to get a kids meal over a certain age or anything. So I thought, what a great idea to get the perfect amount of food since I wasn't that hungry. Well, the waitress was very rude and would not allow it, despite me even showing her there is nothing showing an age limit. I settled on just a drink and small side item.   The food is good and prices are alright. Service once seated took a little while as well. I will not be returning, to this location at least. It really struck me badly when the waitress would not allow me to order what was on the menu. If you don't want me to order kids meals, put something on the menu stating that only under 12 or something.",

The favorites at the table We're the Cinnamon Roll pancakes, red velvet pancakes and the savory meals with Portuguese sausage were a 10 too! Very large portions for everything. The breakfast classics are served with rice/potatoes and pancakes/toast. The music made me feel like I was on an island,really chill vibe. I definitely love this place and will be trying to the one closer to me on Flamingo. Also in advance if you're with a large party know that you won't be seated till the whole party is there and they don't do split checks. There is a max of 2 cards allowed to be used. Just some tips if you plan on eating with a large party!",

    "text": "TLDR; Filipino/American breakfast. The food is alright and the place can get pretty crowded and hectic at peak hours.   Our car was trying to head back to San Diego at a good time so we opted out of eating a buffet and found this restaurant. Large amount of reviews and it's Filipino food? Sounded like a good idea. We managed to come closer to closing time so the place was empty and we were seated immediately.   There's a lot of food on their menu and it seems like they're most known for their pancakes since there were so many variations, it took up half of a side of the menu. But we weren't feeling sweet food and went for savory.   We ordered the corned beef hash and eggs and the Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice.   Corned Beef: You have the option of choosing rice or potatoes and toast or pancakes. You can even get garlic rice for an extra buck! The corned beef wasn't what I was expecting...usually I've had mushier ones but theirs was crispy! It had a good flavor and it was salty. And normally that would be a bad thing but the garlic rice wasn't salty at all and the corned beef helped with that. The pancakes were whatevers to me though. It wasn't very fluffy...more stiff than other restaurants.   Adobo Fried Rice: So this dish pretty much is a fried rice omelette. I don't think the adobo meat pieces were apparent but you could taste it. Because you were eating it with the egg, there wasn't as much flavor too since I don't think the egg was salted much.   Overall, it's not a terrible restaurant but nothing gave a wow factor.",

Anyways, their other pancakes r super fluffy and yummy, like I've tried them before and they're good. But they ain't no red velvet pancakes. I mean. RED. VELVET. PANCAKES.   now you may be wondering: this girl is crazy and why is she so obsessed with red velvet pancakes?  They're not too sweet, like it's a perfect balance. The syrup makes the already fluffy red velvet pancakes so moist. The chocolate chips on top add a crunch that just adds so much more texture in every bite. The whipped cream even is sweet and fluffy and cold which goes so well with the warm pancakes. The pancakes are just. So good.   If you read all this, I'm honestly impressed.",

Filling was something like tomatoes, onions, bell peppers, and... mushrooms? Normally topped with Swiss cheese, but you can sub another type (I asked for cheddar, got pepper jack, and said it was fine. Waitress knew and offered to take it back.)  - hash browns: standard. Not really crispy, so if you like the crisp, maybe ask for well done?  You can choose toast or two pancakes, with a slight cost for anything other than your standard buttermilk pancake.   - lemon ricotta pancakes: thin, like crepes (which is what it said on the menu), and just ok. Kind of my fault for not getting something popular. Not much ricotta or lemon. Comes with cream cheese syrup which was quite good.   - red velvet pancakes: straight dessert. Very tasty, with the red velvet pancakes True to taste for a red velvet. With lots of whipped cream and the cream cheese syrup, all in all a heavy dessert, sweet and delicious.  Service was wonderful. Personable and friendly.   Parking- easy.   On a Monday morning- no wait.",

I always order the skillet with avocado, cheese and bacon and it's the perfect amount of food for one person. Every time I go there is a bit of a wait ranging from 15 minutes to an hour if you go during weekend brunch times. Their entire selection of pancakes are really great but the red velvet is simply the best if you like red velvet flavors. It's not too sweet and after you finish a stack, you kind of want more, that's how good these pancakes are.",

Personally, I am not a fan of Las Vegas. Let me rephrase that, I am not a fan of the strip. There's an unmistakable wafting quality of False pretense that is dressed so glamorous yet you can still see the brown stains running down the back of the pant leg. The parts of Vegas I enjoy are the un-glamorous, non-glitzy, wear your shames and your fears and your mess on your sleeves and your face. BabyStacks is beautiful, though -- like a diamond surrounded by rubies incased in coal.   The Kalua Pig Benedict was a darling -- moderately juicy yet brimming with flavor but also tasting like every good eggs benedict you've ever had in your unremarkable but brilliant life. I also tasted two different omelettes, and if I ever learn how to do an omelette right, it's over for you (no specific 'you' just the entire universe, like 'the snap'). If you order a tre tre (entree for non-Tom Haverford people), get a baby stack or short stack, whatever it is. Don't go full stacks, people! It's too much for you.  I really don't like food waste.",

Try the Kalua Pig Benedict for a twist on eggs benedict - the combination of Hawaiian shredded pork and cabbage really makes the dish. Or, if you're a fan of pretending to be British and having afternoon tea, order the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes.  They're crepe-thin with an elegant lemony flavor, and the sides of fresh lemons, cream cheese syrup (way tastier than it sounds,  trust me) and powdered sugar are served prettily arranged on a delicate lacy plate.  You'd expect to pay extra for these fun dishes, but the price compares favorably to chain brunch places, with most entrees items in the $8-12 range.

We loved this place so much we came here twice during our one week vacation here in Vegas.   On both of our visits the place was crowded, but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Service was friendly and fast. From the time we placed our order to the time we got our food, probably was only about 10 minutes.   Everything we ordered was soo good! The spam scramble w/garlic fried rice, cookies and cream pancakes, adobo fried rice, bananas foster pancakes, kalua pork grilled cheese and spam and eggs were all equally delicious!  Whether you are in the mood for sweet or savory, you can't go wrong with any of the dishes.   Just to highlight on a few: 1) The garlic fried rice is quite tasty!  Just like how my mom used to make it. Lots of garlic flavor, just enough salt and even some bits of the rice is crunchy. I like my rice like that, brings back childhood memories.   2) The Kalua pork grilled cheese was delish! The pork was smoky and had the perfect amount of saltiness to it. The Muenster and cheddar cheese made this grilled cheese oozing with cheesy goodness.   3) Bananas foster pancakes - saving the best for last! My mouth is salivating as I'm writing about these pancakes!  The pancake alone is fluffy and has great flavor. The brown sugar butter combo serves as the syrup in this dish, thank goodness. It has the right amount of sweetness and the bananas was caramelized perfectly.   I could keep going on, but you must try this place out for yourselves!!",

We ended up going with an entree and upgrading our side to a baby stack so that we could try out some flavors.   The adobo omelette was tasty and a good sized portion. The red velvet pancakes we got as it's side was also really yummy.  They were moist and the cream cheese syrup wasn't overly sweet. All in all we were very pleased.   Now our second entree was ordered later (since I couldn't decide what I wanted) and ended up coming out just as we finished our first dish. We were severely disappointed this time around.   The chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes were alright...they didn't taste too bad, but they were pretty dry. The two pancakes instantly soaked up all the syrup we poured on them and texture was dry, sticky, and all wrong. Not enjoyable at all, but at least they didn't taste disgusting.   Then came the baby chick skillet. The eggs we ordered over easy were cooked perfectly, but the entire dish lacked flavor. The chicken was microscopic because we literally found one piece that was smaller than the potato cubes. And to top it off, I found a piece of hard packaging plastic in my second bite.   We stopped eating and brought it to our waitress's attention. She took the plate back and somebody else came out to talk to us about it. This lady inquired about where we found the plastic and when we told her, she  said that was weird because everything in the dish is freshly made and not packaged. That's exactly what I thought, but there is no excuse for foreign objects to be found in food and it wasn't cool how accusingly she spoke to us, as if we were the ones who put it there.   Then they tried to give us a 20% discount on the meal instead of taking the skillet off the tab completely. This was very upsetting considering we only had three bites in all and left the rest of the dish untouched (including that tiny piece of chicken that was only found after thorough inspection). It was only after my boyfriend insisted they take the skillet off that they proceeded to do so. We still tipped our waitress $5, but I left extremely unhappy about how they handled the whole situation.",

I couldn't decide between the famous red velvet pancakes and white truffle with macadamia nut pancakes, so I got a small order of both. The white truffle pancakes was good, but red velvet pancakes was so much better!!!   We also ordered Kailua Pig Eggs Benedict with seasoned potatoes, and I can only say \"Yummy!\"   We went there on Sunday morning around 9:30, just to avoid the rush hour for brunch, and we got seated within 5 minutes. The waitress was nice and patient. The price was good considering the portion that you get. Definitely worth the 15 minutes driving from strip!",

They have friendly wait staff always delicious meals. It's never a hit and miss. It's always very good and consistent.

Thankfully, we finally got in at the bar counter.  I did the BYO omelette, which is cool cause you can add one of the specialty pancakes for, like, a dollar or two.  I added the lemon ricotta pancakes.    The omelette was good but I found myself adding a ton of salt and pepper.  The pancakes, however, were awesome!  The cream cheese syrup was SO GOOD.

    "text": "Gotta love babystacks! When I miss Hawaii, and their awesome breakfast. I would come here to just satisfy my soul. With big portions, and great Hawaiian offerings, how could one go wrong here for breakfast? Oh, but I come for the panclocks! I had a morning date with my favorite 8 year old man Vince. Plus I owed him a good birthday breakfast so I had to make it count! The wait wasn't long at all. We were seated at a small table for two, but they were so accomodating to move us to a bigger table when my sister dropped in for breakfast last minute.   Vince ordered their orange creamsicle pancake (figures since his favorite color is after all orange.) After sampling a few bites, I would say that it tastes a lot like an orange creamsicle. The pancake is also orange. It is a fun choice for kids. the cream cheese and orange syrup was pretty delish and made for a good mix with the pancakes.   I however, ordered the lemon ricotta. It is served with three crepe like thin pancakes and fresh lemon slices with cream cheese syrup. If you are a sweedish pancake fan or even a fan of tart and sweet...THIS IS THE PANCAKE FOR YOU! Oh..it was amazing. the pancakes were thin and soft, and the tart and sweetness combo made it just the right choice. the portions are big so you will get full fast.  I also took bites of their nutella crepe which is loaded with nutella and are huge! If you love nutella or nutella crepe for that matter. do recommend theirs as well.",

The pancakes tasted like they were from a mix. I liked my banana cream pie pancake very much. Sweet with lots of bananas and other sweetness. The macadamia on the other hand was just pancakes with white chocolate chip. Macadamia nuts were missing on her plate.   The staff is friendly and the drinks server was attentive.

They have nice music playing that reminds me of my visit to Hawaii last year. The servers were cordial. Since the hotel food was soooooo expensive it was a welcome relief to see their pricing.  As far as the food. We ordered burritos, pancakes and also the Spinach Benedict. I had some of each and loved each item.  Funny... they don't bring pancake syrup with some of the pancakes. The sauces seem to be enough to dress the pancakes but we asked for syrup anyway.  If your in Vegas and want a place to eat breakfast I recommend this place. The menu is extensive.",

I love to go off strip to find hidden gems and Baby Stacks is defiantly one. Very rare you find SPAM and eggs on the menu. But Pancakes is were they shine the banana cream pie pancakes were off the chart. I had to come back the next day to try the Red velvet pancakes and the Almond Joy Pancakes. i didn't get to the Orange or the lemon ricotta pancakes but i will be back.",

    "text": "Hawaii in Las Vegas?! I was Airbnb-ing nearby, and before heading out to Red Rock, it was only smart to fill up my belly first. Found this place on Yelp, apparently known for its pancakes. Not that I'm a huge pancake person, but I was with someone who is picky and flapjacks is one of the few things he eats, so pancake house we went. We were there before 9am on Saturday and got ourselves a table right away. I saw a few seasonal pancake specials on the board (ex. Pumpkin pancakes). I was trying to get into a pancake mood... but then I realize I may have stumbled on something special. But before I got too excited then highly disappointed, I asked if the ENTIRE menu up for grab that morning, AND the waitress said YES!   My friend, they have Spam Scramble served with rice and a side. SPAM SCRAMBLE! There was no need to even consider anything else. I decided to try their garlic rice instead of plain white rice. I chose a side of macaroni salad. I even ordered a side of their \"country gravy\" (think thick brown gravy).  Best $7.95 (plus $1 for garlic rice and $0.75 for gravy) ever spent on breakfast. NOW - be warned, they aren't messing with the garlic. I could have fought Dracula himself with the amount of garlic I had on my breath. But it was good. The eggs were fluffy, mixed in were chunks of Spam-goodness. They sprinkled a little of furikake all over. At the end I mixed in some of the gravy with the rice. It was legit. Highly recommend this place, and by gosh, not just for the pancakes!",

Let me say that the service was great. No problems in that area. I ordered the carrot cake pancakes.  Came with some icing to serve as a syrup.  I was like okay this is different...it should work.  It would have worked...if the pancakes weren't as dry as cardboard.  I felt like I was eating a carrot cake flavored notebook! I like syrup since it soaks in and helps in the event that you jack up and overcook the cakes.  The icing just sat on top and did nothing.  It was rough.  I'm not saying this place is bad.  I would give it another chance when I'm in town.  Maybe they just had an off day (with my plate).  With so many choices in pancakes, I would try it again.  Next time...better be on point tho!",

I have to... eat different egg benedicts... you know???  Back in the day there was a ton of hype for BSC, all my friends were uploading pictures of their glorious pancakes. Now that hype is over and being an egg making master I've become disappointed with the eggs. The previous visits I've always had eggs that are overcooked, makes me sad. The portions have gotten smaller and isn't exactly the cheapest spot in the neighborhood. These days my tooth isn't as sweet anymore to devour their variety of pancakes. I've always thought $3 for a smaller glass of orange juice is a bit high.   While BSC does have an array of Hawaiian breakfast items, it just doesn't scream excellence or cause any cravings. However if you are determined to have your first meal of the day at BSC, my favorites were the kalua benedict, the Huntington skillet, and carrot cake pancakes.   Service has always been fine, water gets refilled, no problems with the bill, and orders are correct.  Au revoir BSC!",

    "text": "Used to frequent this place regularly back when I first moved to Vegas but I'm glad to come back about four years later to see that everything remained great as usual!   As expected there was a wait but even though we were quoted about 45 minutes, it ended up being only a 25 minute wait! Service was great, it was hectic but the servers and hostesses kept their cool. Major props today since it was so busy because of the holiday.   They have a wide selection to choose from on their menu. On the front, you have what you would expect from breakfast/brunch joints such as egg and meat entrees, omelettes, pancakes, and skillets. On the back, you have a variety of Asian-fusion choices.   The portions are quite large and most entrees come with potatoes or toasts on the side. When you're trying this place out for the first time, definitely get the Red Velvet Pancakes because the hype is real for those suckers. They're so fluffy and tasty! The Spam Scramble is also a must try. It looks like something your mom might make at home but Babystacks makes them with a such a tasty twist by adding Furikake.   Don't know why I stopped coming here regularly when everything is so great but I guess I shall be back soon!",

The fried rice was good but not the best I ever had so it was just okay, nothing super special that I would come back for. The potatoes was actually pretty good - well cooked and well seasoned. The hazelnut pancakes were nice and fluffy and not too sweet which I really appreciate since most places tend to dump a whole jar of sugar in their pancakes. I think it went very well with the wiped cream on top with no additional syrup.  Overall Taste 3/5 Serice 4/5 very friendly Price: 4/5 reasonable and worth it Parking: 4/5 plenty in the lot",

My husband and I came at 730am on a Tuesday and there were already about 12 people in the restaurant. You're welcomed by the host right when you enter and we got to choose where we wanted to sit.   Service - the waiter was soft spoken and aided the kick back feel of the restaurant. She gave us some time to look over the menu after taking our drink order. Once we put down the menu she knew we were ready to order and came back to our table.   Menu - it's a big menu. In order to figure out what you wanna eat, you gotta choose what category you want to attack. From there...good luck in choosing just ONE.   Price - at first glance the prices are...pricey BUT it's because it comes with pancakes. Yes, you can have hash browns or potatoes, but don't. Upgrade your pancake!   Order - I got the Hawaiian Benedict with the cookies n cream baby stack. My husband got the Kalbi ribs and eggs with the German chocolate baby stack. Whoaaaa. The portions are pretty big and we never are able to finish our pancakes. *Con - prepare yourself to struggle eating the Kalbi ribs, but the taste is worth it!  Overall - you can't go wrong with anything you choose. You'll come back to try something else. And if you're not feeling spam, Portuguese sausage, or kalbi ribs...they have traditional choices also. But don't do that to yourself",

BabyStacks is a neat Filipino American joint that serves up a mean baby stack (or full stack!) of pancakes. Went there this morning and it didn't take too long for two of us to be seated. The service is on-point! Iced water and coffee served quickly, and the waitress came back around quickly to get our food order.  I ordered the Lolo special of adobo fried rice and an upgrade to a babystack of Oreo pancakes (aka the Cookies and Cream pancake stack, that is served with a little dish of cream cheese drizzle). Pancakes were yummy, reminding me of chocolate cake batter and came with crushed Oreo's on top of the whip cream. The adobo fried rice came wrapped in an omelet looking get-up. I'm not mad about the adobo fried rice, for sure. I think the eggs might need some pepper, salt, and/or hot sauce. Good thing they bring hot sauce and ketchup to the table, so that helped!   I'm looking forward to returning and trying other pancakes and other Filipino American food. Gotta rep!",

But I'll tell you that there is more than just pancakes and they do well because the breakfast/brunch food here is a real draw.  And it is more than just buttermilk pancakes as the specialize in really unique flavors and toppings.  I remember making cheap tin can versions of corned beef hash for dinner as a kid, this one is made with a much better quality of corned beef and a very pleasant balance of potato and onion.  There is onion in it and I don't like onions but this one did not taste onion-y.  I liked the kalbi short ribs and eggs and all of the pancakes were really good.  The only thing about this place that keeps me from going more often are the hours, otherwise I would probably go here for 'breakfast for dinner'",

I tried the corned beef hash and eggs with a side of blueberry pancakes.  Very good!  The hash was tasty and flavorful without being ridiculously salty.  The potatoes were fairly standard.  The eggs were cooked perfectly over hard just as requested.  The pancakes were fluffy and moist though didn't have quite as many blueberries inside as I would have liked.  Some blueberry compote on top would've made a nice finishing touch also, but it did come with some fresh blueberries placed atop the pancakes.   Overall this was a very enjoyable and satisfying meal!  Keep in mind it is strictly a breakfast/brunch place as they close fairly early in the afternoon (I think around 3pm).",

We came in a hour before closing, so there was spacious seating available! We were promptly seated and provided drinks.  We ordered the following off of the Babystacks menu -  Kids Meal: Egg, Pancake, Sausage, (Substitute potatoes for a biscuit) Chicken Fried Steak with Scrambled eggs and Sourdough Toast Mochi Pancakes (Special)  All of it was prepared within 20 minutes upon placing the order. My daughter ate her entire meal! She thought it was delicious. None of her food was overcooked or under-cooked.   My chicken fried steak was cooked appropriately. The gravy was flavorful and not too oily. There was enough gravy on the chicken fried steak where it wasn't too overpowering of the meal. The scrambled eggs were cooked and didn't taste like processed eggs. The Sourdough toast was drenched with butter, just the way I like it!   The Mochi Pancakes was actually delightful. I wasn't sure what to expect, but the Mochi flavoring was on-target. The whip-cream that was on-top of the pancakes was just enough. I only had a few bites from my boyfriend's Mochi Pancakes, but those few bites tasted great! It was quite filling. I would order Mochi pancakes again from Babystacks if they put it on their menu, instead of just a special.  Great food, great service! I'll be back to this location again!",

Our server, Loreal, was very friendly and attentive. My friend ordered the steak and eggs, which were good. I ordered the adobo omlette and upgraded to the banana cream pancakes for $1.50, which is a pretty decent price to upgrade to their signature stacks. The adobo omlette was yummy. I just wish the omlette to rice ratio was better. There was much less adobo rice compared to the omlette. If I'm ever in the area again, I'll for sure come back!",

If you are looking for the perfect pancake, I'm pretty sure this is the restaurant that makes their pancakes look as good as they taste. Every time I order pancakes at a breakfast place, I'm always hesitant because I am not a fan of dry pancakes. Babystacks definitely has mastered the art of pancake making, their pancakes are soft, moist, and sweet. Highly recommend the Red Velvet pancakes. If there is anything you go here for it's the pancakes! Their omelettes here are pretty tasty too. Also, if you've never tried a grilled cheese sandwich with pulled pork - it is a must!    This place can get pretty busy, so try to come here on non-busy days such as the weekday. It's roomy, so don't be shy to come here with your brunch group.",

I love eggs, bacon and toast with jam. But once in a while I love to switch things up, get an omelette, some pancakes.   Today I tried the ranchero omelet, a little chicken some cheese and a great green chili sauce. I loved the omelette, hash browns looked great but had only one crispy side and a bit mushy on the other. But the real star was the red velvet pancakes!   They are so good, rich chocolate with whipped cream and cream cheese frosting syrup. Almost too sweet. Overall, a great meal!",

I come away with to-go containers for later. Like maybe 10 minutes later! Today's orders were equally generous and delicious: Portuguese Fried Rice - omelette with sausage & mushrooms. Did I see some Spam cubes? Winner!  And Bananas Foster. Yes, you can have your fruit and pancake, too!.  Attentive service is always courteous and comes with a smile. Thank you, Amanda & Alejo.

As far as the Omelette it had a nice amount of flavor with plenty of fried rice and meat inside . It was very good. BUT the star of the show were the bananas fosters!! OMG!!!! I want to curse but I'm going to \"keep it classy San Diego\" who would've thought to do a bananas fosters pancakes! There were pretty AmazinG! Great recommendations by one of the servers.

The Kalua Pork Benedict was also a favorite at the table. I would also order it again! My husband and I shared this with the pancakes and it was the perfect mix of savory and sweet.  We ordered our kids a full order of s'mores pancakes to share. Don't get me wrong, they were delicious, but didn't compare to the other two. My kids devoured their plates though!",

The establishment was a decent size, and it took less than 20 minutes for our party of 9 to be seated. Mind you, we got here pretty early, probably around 9am, so it might be busier later in on the afternoon. The servers were very friendly and efficient which made the experience a lot better.  The Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice is one of the local's favorites, along with the red velvet pancakes so that is what I ordered. They have so many different pancake flavors it's so hard to choose which one to try. I definitely wanted to try them all! The red velvet pancakes were delicious! The consistency was perfect! The pancakes were fluffy and they're a good size for one person. The icing that is served with it makes it super sweet so I recommend only using a little bit. I must say, I was kind of disappointed about the adobo fried rice. It comes as an omelette that is stuffed with the adobo fried rice, it was good, but it wasn't great. I feel like the flavors were pretty bland and not that enjoyable.   Overall, I would definitely come back to try more of the pancakes that they have and I recommend people try this place out as well!",

He wanted pancakes and I went along because I figured they don't have Only pancakes, right? Right!  I ordered the \"HM1 (FMF)\" (pork, bacon, green onions, cilantro, Swiss cheese; $9.50). Not sure why it's called that and neither did our server lol. Whatever though, because it was delish.  A cool thing about ordering is how easy it is to customize. My HM1 could come as either an omelette or skillet, egg whites upgrade, or even an upgrade to their signature babystacks. I went with this last option because, why not? I chose the red velvet and, wow... I'm a fan of pancakes again!  Came back again this morning as it is my birthday. I took my friend here so I could have a Babystacks as a breakfast birthday cake lol. Great spot and I look forward to trying all the flavors.",

The pancakes are delicious and creative, but a lot of places have delicious and creative pancakes. You will never show up here and not have to wait a minimum of 30 minutes for a table, so the sole reason that I suffer the wait is that it's the only place I can get garlic rice. And it's GOOD garlic rice. Today I joined a few friends for brunch. We met at 12:30, were seated around 1, and unfortunately got the table next to the window. And the air conditioning was apparently broken. It was 108 outside and at least 150 inside. At one point, Satan stopped by our table to ask how the food was. Ok, I may have hallucinated the Satan part, as I was in full on heat stroke. It was difficult to enjoy the meal with all the sweat that was dripping into it. I couldn't help but feel sorry for the employees back in the hot kitchen. In the Las Vegas summer, you have to put more effort into temperature control. If I'm waiting 30 minutes for a table, I expect you're bringing in enough revenue to invest in a couple fans at least. I don't feel so well after sitting there sweating.",

I wanted to switch things up and so I gave BabyStacks a shot. Definitely not disappointed.   This location was a fairly small little spot, but the wait wasn't terrible. Like many diners, people get in and out at a good pace. I spent most of the wait with neck breaking turns left and right to stare down people's food as it came to the tables.   I ended up choosing Rick's Adobo Fried Rice and just loved it. A good amount of food at a reasonable price and I can see why it is considered to be one of the \"local's favorites.\"   Also had a chance to taste the Cinnabun pancakes. If you're not concerned about your blood sugar levels, then get after this. The short stack (which will set you back all of $5 and some change) comes with 3 pancakes and trust me when I say you better be famished if you think you're going to finish a full order.    So many other items on the menu I'm looking forward to trying. I'll be back soon.",

Unlike Jamms, they have \"3 locations\" you can visit and if you are out of towners, they have a closer location.  Now I can't recall what my other half order but I can for sure tell you what I ordered...because of the pictures, duh!!!  LOL.  The red velvet pancakes were moist and literally melts in your mouth once you engulf it into your mouth.  The bacon was crunchy on the outside and chewy on the inside.  Hash browns where soft and fluffy to eat and of course they fixed my eggs just the way I like them!  Besides the long wait, it is definitely a place to repeat!",

    "text": "I went here with my cousin after she picked me up from the airport. She recommended it to me, as it is the original BabyStacks Cafe in Las Vegas.  I ordered their Banana Cream Pie pancakes and the Hawaiian-like combo order, which I don't remember the name of, that consisted of Spam, eggs cooked to order (I got my usual scrambled), white garlic rice and furikake (rice seasoning of Japan). The breakfast definitely reminded me of what I typically eat for breakfast, as I really love Spam! Spam was good, although I should have asked to have them cooked longer to brown them - my Spam was just cooked and hot (which isn't particularly bad). The rice could have been made better as it was more moist than I usually have white rice. The pancakes were really good, but the bananas weren't as fresh - soggy, brown was how they were presented to me. I think that the pancakes were definitely sweet enough to go with the banana cream pie part and didn't require any syrup of any kind.  I also tried my cousin's red velvet pancakes with the cream cheese syrup. It was VERY red in color (I don't think they should put that much color in there), but it turned out to taste really well and not have an artificial taste. Usually with a bright color, I associate that with artificial taste, but this was not the case for the pancakes.  Overall, I would definitely come back here again, so I can try all the other flavors of pancakes they have! The price per person was definitely matching the quality and portion of food! I recommend this place to anyone visiting Las Vegas, or any locals!",

This place is small, but it makes you feel like you're at home.  We came around brunch time, and it was packed!  We only had to wait about 30 minutes and trust it's worth the wait.  I'm a lover of breakfast/brunch food, and gosh after reading the menu over and over I seriously just wanted a small portion of EVERYTHING! haha. But finally decided on Rick's Adobo Fried Rice. Lord have mercy!!!! Super super delicious, and the portion of this omelet stuffed adobo fried rice was insane!  I really loved the fact that the fried rice was served with egg because I was thinking about ordering a side of eggs, welp, sure didn't have to! It was divine, I don't know how else to explain it but dude JUST GET IT!  My bf ordered the LOCO MOCO and that was another nom nom nom dish!  The gravy with the beef patty was glorious AND served with eggs, uh hello?! SCORE!  He also ordered the RED VELVET PANCAKES, since we kept seeing on other yelpers review that it was a MUST, and let's just say it was the BEST red velvet pancakes I've ever had!  The cream cheese syrup was absolutely delicious!! My new favorite way of having syrup! Genius!  Alright, stop reading this review and go order already! This place is great and I'm definitely coming back whenever I visit!",

The red velvet pancakes were sweet and rich, not too sweet. The wait however can be long, so expect that. The server checked on us a few times, but we did have to ask for water. The flow of the cafe was not good, it was cramped and the seating was not enough room for all 7 of us (we are not huge people,) but we made do. I am rating this a 3 because although the food was good, service and space provided could of been better.",

I had Portuguese sausage eggs and rice. That was pretty good. My wife had the pork adobo fried rice omelet. She said the eggs was a little over cook and dry but she enjoyed it. But the red velvet pancakes was awesome. It's a little small but I ordered the short stack so maybe that's how it comes. But it was really good and the cream cheese syrup just tops it off!! If you ever in Vegas you gotta stop here and hit up those red velvet pancakes. I would definitely come back to baby stacks when ever I'm in Vegas",

I tried their Rick's adobo fried rice, which comes wrapped in an omelette-style egg, and the loco moco, which has two eggs any style you want on house made burger patty on top of steamed white rice slathered in their gravy. Both were really good, although definitely a bit heavy for the morning. I opted to spend $1.50 more to add on their babystack pancakes as a side. I tried the red velvet which was delicious with the whipped cream but the cream cheese syrup was too heavy for me. The smores was okay. It didn't have much  chocolate chips and marshmallow in the batter and the toppings were lacking. Wish I tried the banana foster instead.   My boyfriend liked the baby chick and omelette and the build your own omelette option. He also usually doesn't like pancakes but he actually enjoyed their cookies and cream pancakes.  Service was a hit or miss depending on how busy they are. We went weekday mornings so we didn't have to wait long but both times it was busy, although one day was definitely more bustling. It took a while to get their attention",

We were seated right away and I couldn't decide on what I wanted to try this time.  Decided to go with the Corn beef/hash with the upgrade on the pancakes and the rice (garlic). The corn beef hash was nothing special. It was good though. I had some of my sisters Adobo Fried rice and it was good! Its adobo fried rice that is in an omelette. I'm getting that next time.

Upon coming here we did take notice that they are known for their pancakes and their adobo fried rice. We order those in addition to the S'mores pancakes and their breakfast 2 egg special.   The 2 egg special wasn't too special I thought. The potatoes as well as the toast  look and tasted like something you can get anywhere.   The adobo fried rice in the egg wrap lacked a bit of salt but was quite good with a touch of hot sauce. Oh yeah, you know this place is Asian owned because they give you some choices of hot sauce in advance before you get your food.  It's tasty but I did wish the fried rice wasn't nearly as soggy.   The S'mores pancakes are just regular pancakes with marshmallows, choco chips, and regular syrup. It was good but not excellent good.   We also got the Kalua Pork benedict. The Kalua pork was juicy, smokey, and so good! I did wish the eggs were hotter and more runnier. I am picky about my benedicts but together, they were still really good.   But the best thing we got undoubtedly was the red velvet pancakes. Slightly crisp on the outside with a dollop of cream and the cream cheese syrup on top. The syrup DOES make the pancakes come alive!  By the bathroom, it shows how the owner wanted to make cupcake flavors into pancakes. I have to say, she did a wonderful job transforming it. Babystacks are regarded as one of 50 US must try pancake locations. I totally would agree with this statement. They have locations in San Diego and Las Vegas.   I thought the service was great overall. I did wish the hostess was friendlier and more outgoing. She seemed like she had a bad day and it was only morning.  So great breakfast choice when you don't wan to eat in a casino when coming here to Vegas as a tourist. Just make sure you come early because there will be a wait here!",

Of course, I ordered it to see what it's all about and I am so glad I did! It has to be one of my favorite things to eat and one of my guilty pleasures! Ever since then, I always opted to go back, but because it was too far from where I lived, going there was usually only on very special occasions such as friends or relatives from out of town and they want a \"local fav\" breakfast joint.   After BabyStacks being so successful, they finally opened a new location right across from my old high school! I frequent now at the Buffalo/Flamingo location because its so close and convenient. Come early when they open because lines will get long!   My typical orders:  Red Velvet pancakes Peanut butter & banana pancakes Rocky road pancakes  These are my top three favorites. They are so good and more dessert like. I usually order my pancakes last because I need something fulfilling to eat at breakfast rather than sweets.  Build your own omelets- I'm a sucker for omelets. I love the option of building my own only for less than $10!  BabyStacks is a Hawaiian/Asian style breakfast joint so a lot of the dishes have rice, spam and macaroni. It tastes a lot like home to me. The portions are huge and very fulfilling!  If you are a local or even from out of town, I recommend this place if you haven't had it yet!",

We love Portuguese sausage and was impressed the menu has Hawaiian style food as well. The garlic rice was different but needed a tad more seasoning. All well prepared and enjoyable.  Better than the other breakfast place we tried.   Need to try some other pancake flavors and more of the Hawaiian specialties next time!",

I always leave Babystacks feeling like I have a food baby... Lol.",

Neat, clean, not a lot of decoration but the food makes up for it, Hawaiian breakfast items and benedicts have become the hot trend here in Vegas so put this little cafe at the top of your list. I love Banana pancakes and the short stack of 3 (couldn't finish) was chock full of bananas both inside and out.  I opted out of the powdered sugar sprinkle.  My hubby got Huevos Rancheros with a side of nicely browned hash browns.  He almost finished it.  It was not too spicy which was fine with him. Our neighboring table got beautiful Kahlua Pork sandwich with fries and the gentleman got some substantial Eggs Benedict. Prices are reasonable.  Hours 7-2 during the week.  Unknown during the weekend. Great little place.  You may wait for your order a bit longer than normal, but you will enjoy every succulent bite",

Just that this has become a regular stop on our travels to Las Vegas... Especially for my kids... We were all the way over in Mandalay Bay and my kids wanted nothing but babystacks for breakfast...  Our orders consisted of s'mores pancakes, Cinnabon pancakes, Rocky Road pancakes, and cookies and cream pancakes... Throw in some seasoned potatoes and one slide order of eggs and all four of us were taken care of... Not to mention, my mother-in-law accompanied us and she is a strict vegetarian... The chef made a very nice skillet for her consisting  of potatoes and cheeses and a multitude of vegetables in a spicy sauce that kept her very happy as well... Thank you for accommodating that!  Our orders were delicious, tasty... Sinfully good!  My one big question is how come you don't find this chain in one of the big Resort Hotels? I think it would be a grand slam... The masses who wander the strip on foot have no clue what a great little place this is!  Better yet, keep it our little secret ;-)",

Their locations are far too small to keep up with the demand. On the days I am craving spam and eggs, my personal favorite, I make sure to wake up before the crack of dawn and get there when they open to avoid any rush. The fact that I do this at all should state how good their food is.   It's my every once and while breakfast treat. If you don't like crowds and you refuse to wake up early, probably hit up the next breakfast joint on your list.",

One pro is that I like how their pancakes are small, easier to eat and cute too",

But this location must be a secret still because we were seated right away, so I'm not sure if I should spread the word or be selfish and keep this to myself!!   So of course we split the red velvet pancakes, it's like dessert for breakfast. I would recommend getting the short stack and splitting it between the table so everyone get a taste, don't know if I could eat an entire plate b/c it may be just a tad too sweet. The adobo omelette was also shared and that had really good flavor, but my absolute favorite, what I got up early for on my day off was the lemon ricotta pancakes (more like a crepe) sweet baby Jesus these brought tears to my eyes, ok maybe a little dramatic but they are so good I need to emphasize how good. So light and refreshing, I just add a tiny layer of butter and sprinkle powdered sugar and dip a bite at a time in the sauce it comes with. If you have a love for lemon like I do, you have to try these. And an added bonus for coffee drinkers, they serve half & half, not non-dairy creamer!! It's the little things in life, I know.....",

MmMmMm...came with a fluffy dollop of whipped butter and side of melted cream cheese icing and sprinkled with chocolate chips crumbles.  I'm normally not a sweets kinda person when it comes to breakfast, but this was absolutely delicious.  It paired well with the Kalua Pig Benedicts.

I understand that the hostesses can't magically make tables appear or kick people out, so I figured- we waited this long- what's a few more minutes right??? but finally after 50 minutes total- we were able to sit down. The waitress came to take our order and someone else came to drop off the food- but when they dropped off the food we got our eggs first, then pancakes later then bacon last... Nothing came at the same time LOL! When we needed silverware, napkins, our missing coffee that never came, and water refills we had to flag down people.

It tasted off to me and it kind of reminds me of lemon Pine Sol, even tough I don't consume household cleaners.",

Great logo and menu layout was good.  Service was good.  They play Pandora which is great.  It is also in my hood so an after-brick workout (swim, bike and run) will make this a fav place to replenish.",

We arrived about 10:50 on Sunday morning. It was a short 10 minute wait for a table. Two of us had the red velvet pancakes and our friend had banana pancakes (not banana cream). We all enjoyed our meals and had boxes to go. OMG! The red velvet pancakes were awesome. I didn't have the chocolate chips on top because that wasn't appealing to me. The service was good and fast. The restaurant is small. The only negative I have is that it is 12 miles from my house. Oh well...that won't stop me from returning.",

Try the strawberry Belgium waffle if you want a light and fluffy well grilled waffle, with fresh strawberries and strawberry compote. This is a spot worth driving to.

I'm not usually crazy about pancakes but these may have made me a pancake convert. They were light and fluffy and not too sweet. The flavours were great without too much syrup. My steak was a little overcooked but the taste made up for it. The hashbrowns were nice and crispy. Wonderful meal; I will be back very very soon!",

I love this take on Hawaiin and Breakfast Food, definitely something different and the pancake variety is crazy good. I personally do not care for pancakes but here, they are irresistable, super moist and fluffy and pretty much any topping you could wish for. One of my favorite dishes tho is the spam omellete, omg... I really don't understand what spam is, nor do I want to, but fried... it is one of the most amazing meats(?) ever!! I love the little sesame & seawood stuff they sprinkle on the rice, what a unique breakfast. The prices aren't too bad either, for the food, I think its worth it, something off the strip and outside of the box.",

It was no coincidence that I found this restaurant, it can only be explained as destiny and a yelp app.   I was in Vegas for a weekend for some friend's birthday and I wanted pancakes for breakfast. Not the tacky boring stuff your face buffet kind but some quality flap jacks.  So where else do I turn to but my yelp app. Thanks people of yelp for steering me and my boyfriend to this neat local spot! I was seriously delighted by the selections and the portions are just right. They have red velvet pancakes, lemon ricotta pancakes, honey wheat, and even strawberry shortcake. I ordered the Portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of bacon pancakes (A slight increase in price for the upgrade, totally worth it.). And my boo ordered the regular sausage and eggs with the banana cream pancakes. He and I both agreed Portuguese is the best way to go because the sausage had a little spice to it that the other sausage could not compete with. Good service, we got our food quickly, and our tummy's were more then satisfied with the portions. We are definitely making this a regular stop on our future Vegas trips.",

Babystacks, listed 3rd, was our second choice but won out because it was closer and I loved the name. So, here we are; first in the door and i have my coffee, so far so good. The sweet sounds or reggae make us smile and relax. The places has quickly filled up as i patiently waited my PB & J pancakes and portugues sausage. My cousin and her friend are anticipating equally exciting combinations including garlic rice (yummy!). ... .. ...(insert smacking, laughing, &enjoying here). The ambiance was perfect, the food devine.  Not that it mattered after an absolutely satisfying meal like this, but the prices were completly affordable. The entire staff was on top of their customer service with pride.  I will def be back next time im in town, which is hopefully Sooner rather than later.

Our server Jonathan was very attentive and friendly with a sense of humor so that was a plus. I ordered the banana pancakes (forgive me I'm not really much of a risk taker when it comes to pancakes) with turkey sausage and eggs with, get this, pepper jack cheese. I was surprised they even had pepper jack cheese so thats another bonus in my book :) I dont't know if my friends and I were just super hungry or they really were taking awhile but the food eventually came to the table.   Im from Los Angeles and here we have a small restaurant chain called Pann's were the pancakes are just YUM! After visiting Baby Stacks I feel they need a new recipe lol. The turkey sausage was good along with the eggs. Although I'm not a huge egg fan i felt they could have shown a little more love (given me more eggs) for my side.  All in all my friends and I really enjoyed our breakfast. Next time I visit Vegas i will definitely return for breakfast.",

    "text": "On Thanksgiving morning, my husband and I wanted to enjoy a nice quiet meal before joining his family this afternoon for the Thxgvn festivities. As an out of towner, we relied on Yelp to find a decent breakfast place and avoid the typical gross joints such as IHOP or Denny's.  With limited holiday option, we decided to check out BabyStacks Cafe.  I been to the first location years ago and was pleased with it. I pleased to see they have done well to open a 2nd location.  Upon arrival, we were warmly greeted and was seated immediately. This location certainly has more space, but it does not have the same 50's style I recall the first location had.  The menu is about the same and I noticed they are offering more \"Hawaiian\" style breakfast which I didn't remember they've had before.  No matter, they still have their famous pancakes.  My husband an I ordered the whole wheat french toast coated with corn flakes cereal.  My husband went with a BYO omelette with a side of Oreo cookie pancake.  When our order arrived, my french toast looked amazing.  They were so thick I decided it's best to eat it using my hand like a french toast bar.  However, my husbands BYO omelette looked less than appealing to me.  The side of hash browns looked dry as if it came out of a frozen package hashbrown.  The omelette is just uninteresting. The Oreo cookie pancake came shortly.  My husband thought it was ok.  It was essentially a chocolate cake not even a pancake with whipped cream; well....not a total lost, the whipped cream was tasty.   My French toast was really good. I also ordered a side of Portuguese sausage so I have a sweet and spicy combination.  It was a good call; the combination was very good.  Overall, I think the place is ok.  I think there are other places that offer a more well rounded offerings here in Las Vegas.",

How could anything cookie butter not be amazing?! GET IT!  The white chocolate macadamia nut pancakes were alright. And the kalua grilled cheese wasn't as flavorful as we were hoping. And the steak and eggs were standard.   Seems like the breakfast entrees are pretty regular but I can't wait to try some of the other pancakes!

The \"s'mores\" pancake had no marshmallows in it, the \"mocha\" pancakes were very bitter.  They also nickel and dime you for everything... skimp on toppings and charge extra for more sauce.  Not impressed when a restaurant does that. Also, waitress barely came around.  When a restaurant skimps on things, it leaves a very negative impression.  I will not be back.",

This is a good option to take out of town guests to since they have a lot of Hawaiian breakfast plates and sweet pancake/dessert options, but I don't want to waste my weekends in line here. The staff does their best to accommodate everyone, but they easily fall behind tasks (providing checks, refilling drinks, condiment requests, etc) since there is so much going on. They also have their location on N Buffalo, so make sure to clarify the location you are meeting people at. You can call ahead for the wait time, but that can change at any moment. Will only come back if I'm feeling lazy.",

I sent her a few Yelp links and she picked BabyStacks Cafe.  I have smart friends!  We met just before 8 this morning.  I have eaten at the other location where I had the red velvet pancakes.  I had studied the menu several times before going and changed my mind as I was ordering.  I got a short stack of the Rocky Road pancakes.  The menu describes it this way:  \"Almonds and marshmallow in chocolate batter, topped with fresh whipped cream, more almonds and marshmallows.  Lightly drizzled with chocolate syrup and cocoa powder.\"  How's that for having dessert for breakfast?  The cakes were excellent!  Very flavorful with lots of good chocolate flavor and the sliced almonds added some nice texture.  Our coffee was refilled quickly.  This was a great place to meet a good friend, have some good conversation, and enjoy some tasty pancakes for breakfast.  There are so many other things on the menu you try, that I'll have to return!",

Not now, not ever. I'm not sure what other one I'll try and I really haven't tried their other breakfast dishes since I feel like going through most of their pancake flavors.

I came here for breakfast this morning to redeem my Yelp Deal. I have been to their first location in the past and was excited that they opened another location closer to my home.   We came in around 10am, and as I have experienced at the other location, the wait was pretty long. Unfortunately, as with the other location, they underestimate the wait time as well. I just like to know what I'm getting into before I decide to wait or not (don't worry, I'm done venting about that).  We were finally seated and the service was friendly and efficient. I ordered the ham and eggs with hash browns and upgraded to the lemon ricotta pancakes. My fella ordered the chicken omelet with homestyle fries and upgraded to the red velvet pancakes. The food was solid, although I was not a fan of the canned ham they served instead of ham steak. I was also a little disappointed that despite asking for my eggs and hash browns well done, the eggs were runny and the hash browns were really pale, not well done by any means. The food was still good though. I'm a big fan of the flavored pancakes, but the lemon ricotta really weren't doing a lot for me. I wish the curd were slightly more tangy and lemon-y, it was just a little too sweet. The red velvet were just right however. I also wish the pancakes had a fluffier consistency, but the flavors are still really nice.  Overall, a good dining experience and I'm still interested in trying more of their menu items.",

    "text": "Red velvet pancakes are GREAT here! However the price to portion ratio is a bit steep. We ordered the red velvet pancakes (short stack), spam sliders with seasoned potatoes, cowboy omelet with hash browns and banana pancakes.  I only truly loved the red velvet pancakes. Everything else was mediocre. The spam sliders were a letdown. It's was mostly egg with small bits of diced spam. We barely tasted any.   Service was decent. And they were fairly quick with our food considering how busy they were.   The restaurant itself is not that big. But it's definitely a bit more spacious than the original restaurant.   I recommend trying this place for breakfast and ordering their red velvet pancakes. I'll definitely come back when i'm in the mood.  However be prepared to wait at least 30 mins during peak hours.",

    "text": "Had to try this place out after seeing all the different kinds of pancakes they offer.  We arrived around 11 on a Monday morning and even with a rush at that time there was little to no wait and it quieted down later that hour.  *Note: Your whole party must be present to be seated and parties of 2 get seated more quickly.  I ordered a b.y.o. omelette (I ordered mine with Swiss cheese, spinach, and mushroom) which came with potatoes (you can order hash browns instead) and a short stack of omelettes.  For a small charge I upgraded my pancakes to the banana cream pie pancakes.  Everything I ordered was very tasty!  I had some of the white chocolate macadamia pancakes as well and must say I liked the banana cream pie pancakes better.  So glad I went with them after much deliberation!  It's a fairly short drive if you're staying on the Strip and there is ample parking in the lot.  They've got a couple of TV's inside which kept us entertained as Chippendales was on the morning news show that was playing ;)  Definitely worth checking out for a tasty breakfast!",

We were able to get seat right before an entire softball team came by.   I ordered the Kalua Pig omlette. The BF ordered the adobo fried rice omlette. We barely spoke to each other because it was that good. I don't know why we thought we can order a stack of pancakes to share because both of these dishes were overwhelming. The BF usually can eat up a storm but he even had to take half of it home. If you came to eat then this is the dish for you. I had the Kalua Pig Omlette and the pork was cooked perfectly. It just melted in my mouth!   Good service, great food, what else can you ask for!",

On the weekends, they are open from 7am-3pm.  WHAT: I cannot believe I have not yet written a review for my ultimate favorite breakfast spot ever!!!  Whenever I am not at work, or wake up early enough to eat breakfast, this is the first place on my mind! I am so glad they are opening up several new locations (this is the 2nd location) because the lines were out the door!!  As everyone recommends, the Red Velvet pancakes are always a hit! Personally, my favorite pancake is the Banana Cream Pie pancakes!! There are so many to choose from, and I bet they are all great. Hmm. I just thought of a new goal.. TRY ALL THE PANCAKES ON THE MENU!  Along with the dessert, the food is undoubtedly WONDERFUL! From the Adobo Omelet, Kahlua Pork Benedict, Kahlua Pork Grilled Cheese, to the Portuguese Sausage and Egg, you cannot go wrong with anything you decide to get. EVERYTHING IS DELICIOSO!!!  So take the time off and bring your family here for an amazing Breakfast/Brunch! Not only will the adults love it, the kids will have a blast from all the stacks of pancakes you will be getting, since you will probably all be TRYING ALL OF THE PANCAKES ON THE MENU! ;)",

And then the FOOD happened, & it was all over:  Steak & Eggs - I chose their oniony, garlicky garlic fried rice instead of potatoes - SO GOOD with my poached & runny eggs.  The steak was perfectly rare, & my side of hollandaise made me happy.  AND - I upgraded the plain pancakes that came with to:  Red Velvet pancakes - not the best textured pancake bc it was a little on the dry or overdone side, but the chocolate shavings & fresh whipped cream & cream cheese-y syrup that came with it made each bite yummy!  The small stacks are two small pancakes, which are the perfect size to try them yet not stuff yourself silly.  Chicken Fried Steak & Eggs - I had a bite of this & it was damn good!  The crispy battered steak & the gravy were really good.  Hash browns were kindof basic, but the upgrade to these were SO good:  Banana Cream Pie pancakes - another short stack of two perfectly textured, light & fluffy little pancakes, topped with vanilla pudding, sliced fresh bananas, & fresh whipped cream.  These were THE BEST!!   Their selection of unique kalua pork menu items (grilled cheese & benedict) as well as fried rice rolled into an omelette make me wonder why these guys don't come to LA!!  This is one of the best breakfast places I've been to.  Definitely a must if you're in the area!!",

Watered down and not a lot of tea flavor.  For main course I had the Cowboy Omelette with cinnabun pancakes. I also tried the carrot, red velvet, and wheat pancakes. Ranked from most to least favorite: Cinnabun, Carrot, Red Velvet, then Wheat.  The cinnabun pancakes was flavorful and not overly sweet. I would highly recommend this pancake. The carrot pancake was good but couldn't taste the carrot flavor. It was very mild and it basically looked like the wheat pancake but a little sweeter. The red velvet was fairly dry and the melted sugar overpowered the red velvet.   The cowboy omelette was okay. The eggs were overcooked but there were lots of ingredients in it. I would have preferred the eggs to be a little more watery and the vegetables a little less overcooked. The fried potatoes were okay. It was not overly salty and not burnt at all.  Overall, I would give this place 3.5 stars. This place is good for breakfast and I would come back here again. Portion size was excellent. They do give a lot for breakfast. Unfortunately, it just missed the mark on certain things. Service was excellent. Pancakes here are excellent. Next time I'll try their french toast and another egg dish to test.",

The kitchen lacks the talent and skill to create and execute traditional breakfast plates. My omlette was made like a pancake, then folded over in half and topped with sliced cheese. The eggs were cooked like a crepe and tasted thin and secondary. The ingredients did not have any interesting or fresh flavors. The meal tasted processed and assembled. BabyStacks should only focus on the pancakes because the other breakfast items are a fail. A waste of money.   The staff is adequate and the decor is pleasant, but there isn't anything special or inspiring about this place.",

All the components put together, with the whipped cream, chocolate chips, & cream cheese syrup, it's 3000+ calories of fantastic goodness for 'breakfast'! The menu has lots of choices, it's asian style of course, with typical Hawaiian and Filipino style breakfast items, and also has the boring American style stuff for my white husband, who does enjoy the adobo fried rice omelette though ;). It's super busy on weekends, but we live nearby so we do pick up all the time. Loco Moco with the garlic fried rice upgrade is awesome. Wish I could eat like this everyday, but then I could see why some Island folks look they way they do, and my blood pressure probably couldn't take it either. You gotta try this place if u havent already. On another note, not sure why Yelp 'filters' my reviews as not real reviews. Your auto computer filter programs can suck it!",

One thing I did notice it things were somewhat disorganized.  I saw lots of open seating, but they were too slow to seat people, even with the 15-30min wait list that was quite long.  What I found odd was the counter seating was not available for walk-up, but rather had to put your name on the list.  I am curious to try other dishes next time I'm in the area.",

We came in on Saturday for brunch and our party of four was seated in about 30 minutes. We each ordered some dishes and shared the sides:   [1] Loco Moco - upgraded to garlic rice topped with a beef burger patty, two eggs over-easy and covered in gravy. I'm a big fan of loco moco and get it any time I can. The garlic rice was a nice upgrade and the dark gravy was delicious.  [2] Lolo Rick's Adobo Fried Rice - adobo fried rice wrapped omelet style and garnished with green onions. This was in a special golden box on the menu and I had my doubts, it was good but a little dry, and not amazing IMO.  [3] Banana Cream Pie Baby Stack - bananas and buttermilk pancakes topped with whipped cream, sliced bananas, and banana cream sauce. Definitely a banana cream overload, but not overly sweet.   [4] Red Velvet Baby Stack - red velvet pancakes topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and a side of cream cheese syrup - this is a stack for all those sweet tooths out there, it's very sweet and the cream cheese syrup just adds to the decadence. Great to share, but I don't think I can conquer a baby stack by myself.   Overall we had a great experience, the service was excellent and the food was great. Kalua pork benedict... I'm coming back for you.",

Before we could even ask for our own they grabbed it from another table of two next to us and just placed it on ours... it was kind of awkward.   They gave us loads of condiments that we didn't need and which such limited space on their tables it was very cramped. But forgot salt and pepper... I have been here before and I thought it was good but this particular visit was not a good one. The steak and eggs I ordered was undercook when I asked for medium one side was burnt, the other side of the steak looked like it had never touched the pan. It was super pink once cut... The eggs were overcooked for what I asked for. My boyfriend had a pretty decent eggs Benedict. I probably won't be here for while... but at least their pancakes are still good.   Also avoid this place if you don't like lines outside the door... the line was crazy! Not one single server offered any guest waiting outside in the sun for 30 minutes plus any water.

My all time favorite pancake flavors would be banana cream, banana's fosters and white chocolate macadamia! Best thing to get is a breakfast combo with eggs & your choice of meat, then get the garlic fried rice and substitute the regular pancakes for the specialty flavors. A couple extra bucks makes it go from great to amazing!",

So I thought I've never been here before, but once I entered the restaurant, I was like ok I actually remember coming here before. I came with my family and they all said the same thing. At that time though, I was more of a savory breakfast type than a sweet breakfast type.   When I first saw the menu, I had a really really hard time choosing. Ive never seen such a large variety of pancakes to choose from. I wanted to get the Cookie Butter French Toast because I LOVE Nutella and cookie butter, but I also really craved Banana Cream Pie Pancakes because I LOVE banana cream pie. So, I just couldn't help it and got both. My mom ordered from the Specials Menu, she got the Toffee Lemon Caramel Pancakes (TLC).   We got short stacks for all the pancakes, which prices vary by type of pancake, but in this instance the banana cream pie pancakes were $5.75, the French toast was $9.50.  The Cookie Butter French Toast was really really good. It had a slight crunch and not overly sweet, just perfect. They used crunchy cookie butter which was just delicious. I would totally get it again.  So for the pancakes, I was expecting banana cream pie pancakes, but it tasted too artificial and nothing like banana cream pie. I was pretty disappointed in that and for the TLC pancakes, they were an even bigger disappointment. They were barely sweet at all, so we asked for some maple syrup.   I would give this place 3 stars if it wasn't for the French toast. It was love at first bite, I instantly fell in love with it. So that boot the 3 to a 4 star.",

It was probably sitting there the whole time, but they were too busy and confused. Asked for crispy bacon and it was chewy, and the bacon in the biscuits and gravy was RAW. The worst part was the customer service chaos though. If you've paid for your order they obviously have the order details, so they shouldn't have to ask three more times exactly what you ordered. And the cashier handling money shouldn't waste time opening each box to have you check it. This means they probably mess up to go orders all the time, so management makes them do it this way. So backwards. They need to come up with a new process and find a balance between their morning rush diners and to go customers.",

The menu is quite extensive and has various options, all full of so much flavor and epitomizes the idea of breakfast soul food! They're open 7 days a week, but only from 7:00am till 2:00pm, meaning wait times can vary -- I once was told there was a 30 minute wait, once immediately... it's just the luck of the draw. But easily it's worth the wait!  FOR HER:  - I ordered my usual, a full stack (6) of WHITE CHOCOLATE MACADAMIA NUT PANCAKES. Infused with so much goodness and topped with powdered sugar and more white chocolate chips. (I also love their RED VELVET PANCAKES w/ cream cheese syrup too!)  FOR HIM: - If I don't order this, he will: LOLO RICK'S ADOBO FRIED RICE OMELETTE. A tradiational filipino dish of marinated shredded chicken & rice wrapped in an egg omelette, garnished with green onions. Comes with a side of homemade macaroni or seasoned potatoes (these are so good!) -- or you can upgrade to your choice of pancakes!",

We went to this BabyStacks because it was closer - menu and quality is the same. This time around, my boyfriend got the corned beef hash because he enjoyed it so much when I ordered it last time. And I decided to try the Hawaiian chili loco moco. Although I had intended to reorder a stack of strawberry pancakes as my side (because the strawberry sauce is to die for), I decided to get the hazelnut pancakes with fresh strawberries. My boyfriend got red velvet with his order.  My Hawaiian chili loco moco was delicious, everything was perfectly seasoned. My hazelnut pancakes were a little dry, it wasn't dry enough to make them not taste good, but it kept crumbling every time I tried to pick it up with a fork. The red velvet pancakes were fluffy, the texture reminded me more of a cake than a pancake which made it great!  I love BabyStacks, I just wish they had one in California so I could eat it more often :-(",

The famed red velvet pancakes are literally a flattened red velvet cake with whipped cream AND cream cheese syrup. Sugar with sugar on top of sugar. On my quest to give myself type II diabetes, this certainly could do the trick.  I could definitely see myself coming back here, but maybe for some more savory fare. I felt sick to my stomach after eating about half the short stack. It's like when you're a teenager and you think that Mike's Hard Lemonade is a) good and b) a good way to get drunk. I've graduated to getting drunk off classier items (Zima) and should have graduated to something less sugary for my midday meal.",

    "text": "I am a huge breakfast person, and this place delivers on that characteristic of mine. It makes me feel at home for two main reasons: the first being that the only red velvet ANYTHING I have liked is my Mom's cake, until I tried Babystacks' pancakes, and the second being that they play local, Hawaiian music.. and I'm Hawaiian :)  After that initial impression, I kept coming back. I discovered how much I love the rest of their unique pancake flavors and the variety on their menu. They have very traditional breakfast/lunch platters, mixed with some dishes you'd only expect to see in Hawaiian restaurants (like Loco Moco or an Adobo Fried Rice Omelette). Whatever you choose, I hope it lives up to your standards as it has for me. It's affordable, the space is cute and quaint, and the staff is very friendly and attentive with every visit I've had. There is usually a wait time, but never one that is unbearable. If it's ever more than 30 minutes until you can be seated, they'll take down your number and call or text you when there is a table available.  The only downfall is if you don't live in the Summerlin area. That is my only real complaint, if you could really call it that. It's quite a drive for me, but each time I've gone it has been worth it.",

I would have to say my overall experience was hardly worth the wait at all.   As for the food, I tried the Red Velvet Pancakes and had bites of the Kalua Pig Benedict. I felt there were flaws in both dishes. I loved the crumbled chocolate on the red velvet pancakes but I have had better ones. It seems as if reading \"cream cheese syrup\" on the menu is supposed to hook you in but I felt that it was nothing more than liquidy cream cheese icing, hardly a syrup really. Plus, there was way too much food coloring in the red velvet pancakes because the color was beyond a deep red velvet and more like an unappetizing shocking red color. The Kalua Pig Benedict didn't stand a chance with soggy english muffins. The \"seasoned\" potatoes were bland and tasted like they were straight out of a frozen bag.     Service here was mixed for me. The hostess was friendly enough considering how busy it was, our waitress was very friendly but the girl at the cashier, the one person actually taking our money didn't provide any customer service at all. A real let down at the end of the meal.   Super random but every time I look at the BabyStacks Cafe logo, I think of the little people from that Facebook game, Restaurant City haha.",

No matter what, ask for their cream cheese sauce. Amazing. As for entrees, my personal favorites are the adobo fried rice (being Filipino) and Kalua pig eggs Benedict. I also ventured to try out the Mexican skillet. Wow. Yeah, leave your diet at home and don't ask for nutritional facts. You are here for the food coma.  They are really five stars, but I deducted one for the long wait. FYI: it is usually a 30-45 minute wait on Saturday / Sunday after 9am so bring your coffee, iPad, knitting project or newspaper to help pass the time. You will be pancake hoarding in no time. They have a few TVs in there for watching football games ;)",

I've eaten at this location recently a few times and I've left feeling happy and full. I really enjoy cafes that only serve breakfast and/or brunch like this one, because they do it right!   If you've ever been to Hawaii and miss those nostalgic eats, like spam, Portuguese sausage, eggs, & rice, Kalua pig Benedict, or some fluffy white-chocolate macadamia nut pancakes, you've found your place that serves all that and more. I haven't tried some of their more creative creations, like their Spam Scramble. Spam, eggs, rice, furikake, with homemade macaroni salad?! Or the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice or classic Loco Moco? It all sounds ono, doesn't it? They also offer omelettes, skillets, burgers, and even Zippy's Chili! If that wasn't enough, their pancakes or babystacks as they call them, are delicious! Classic toppings like blueberry and buttermilk, but their unique flavors like Orange Dreamsicle, rocky road, PB&J, S'mores, Carrot Cake, Banana Cream, even Bacon pancakes are sure to catch your eye. They are most known for their Red Velvet, however the rest of the selections sound just as delicious, I think. Recently, we tried the Cinnabun and Hazelnut w/ Nutella. Light, fluffy, and delicious, as pancakes should be! Their garlic rice, which are sauteed with onions are amazing, which many people substitute for the plain steamed white rice.   Another thing I love is the way BabyStacks lets you substitute anything, some for a small up charge. Garlic rice? Egg whites only? Lemon Ricotta pancakes instead of regular buttermilk? I appreciate restaurants like this that'll make your breakfast the way you want it! And the prices are very reasonable. Their highest priced item I saw was $11.95, and that's for a full breakfast entree, which you get a big portion of meat accompanied with rice or potatoes AND pancakes or toast.   I've had great service on each of my visits. Waters filled, food delivery fast, and servers are friendly and helpful.   Honestly, the only thing that makes this place less than 5 stars is probably the wait to be seated. I've been lucky not to have waited very long, but my servers told me there's certain weekdays that can go an hour wait for a table. See...the food must be good!  Check it out if you haven't already...and go hungry!",

I still prefer the ones from the Grand Lux cafe, but these are a very close 2nd. I also got a veggie omelette, which was good but not amazing.  I was impressed by the variety on the menu. I would definitely come back again to try other items on the menu and have the red velvet pancakes.",

Its about 10 minutes from the strip and usually a line out the door, but worth the wait.  Stop by early and you won't have a wait, but who wakes up early in Vegas.  Try any of their pancakes or their Adobo Fried Rice Omelette.  Enjoy!",

We went on a Sunday morning and were met by a crowd and an hour wait to be seated with 6 people.  It was however totally worth the wait.  Being from out of state and not having a chance to try everything we ended up sharing bites of our food choices around the table.  Everything was delicious.  Lots of fun flavors like red velvet and orange creamsicle.  I also got to taste the crepes which were just the right about of thin and tender with yummy fresh fruit in them.  I ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice which is an egg omelet of sorts with salty meaty fried rice wrapped up in it like a burrito.  It was the perfect amount of savory to go with all of the sweet pancakes.",

On a Sunday morning, the wait time 30-40 min was pretty standard.  The place was small and packed full of people which was a great sign! We were seated at the bar and impressed by the variety of pancakes. They sounded more like different pies or cheesecakes.  One dish caught my eye: homemade corned beef hash + eggs + rice + pancakes! Ii wasn't a fan of their homemade version because it didn't have enough potatoes and wasn't cooked enough, so it felt like dog food. I think I would have preferred the canned corned beef hash.  My sister got the Spam version. We had to. YOLO.  The rice was a nice touch to breakfast. Reminded me of being at home. I wasn't too impressed by the pancakes, my sister got carrot cake and cinnabun pancakes. They were a tad too sweet for my taste and also I prefer a fluffier pancake.  Overall, this was a cute place. Service was friendly and you can tell this place is a hit with the locals and tourists.",

I always get the same thing and each time I get the two egg breakfast I ask for my sunny side eggs to be cooked a little longer because it's kind of unappealing and disturbing when your egg can jiggle and I don't like my eggs like that yet they don't cook them longer :)) Whenever I come I PRAY I don't get this one lady and I always get her sadly. Her attitude is horrible she rolls her eyes the last time I was here I had to ask another server to go and get my waiter  because I was ready to order and she came out and once she saw me and my friend she rolled her eyes faked a smile and walked over to help us. Each time I come in I have to ask other people to help us because she doesn't check up on our table. I'm sitting her now and I had to ask someone else for the check and another worker had to ask if we wanted a re fill on drinks because they were empty and have been like that for a while because she doesn't check up on us. On the bright side Jordan is a very good worker and very helpful. I hope I don't get this lady the next time I come in she really deserves to be fired because it's honestly ridiculous how horrible her customer service is. Also as i'm sitting her someone else had to bring me my check. FOOD IS GREAT BUT THE LADY WITH THE FLOWER TATTOO ON HER CHEST NEEDS TO BE FIRED",

While in Vegas, we noticed a common theme, all of our best meals were off the strip, and Babystacks was not an exception.  The touristy thing would have been to stay on the strip for breakfast, but after seeing all of the pictures of red velvet pancakes, i couldn't resist.  I applaud Babystacks for providing a half and full stack option, there is nothing worse than feeling full and sad for wasting all of that food.  I ordered the half stack and i love how they embodied the essence of  red velvet cake.  They could have been lazy and served the pancakes with maple syrup, instead they came up with a genius way of incorporating the cream cheese element into a sauce.  When it arrived to the table i was unsure of the look of the sauce, but after tasting it, it was delicious, a wonderful accompaniment to the lightest pancakes. I also ordered a side of turkey bacon at it was fab.   Overall, Babystacks is a very humble restaurant serving dynamite food, and i look forward to coming back and trying more pancakes on my next visit.",

    "text": "Second visit - and glad I did. First visit service was kind of horrible so it distracted from my overall experience. Took family visiting from town on a Saturday morning - a party of 6 and the wait was reasonable.  Everyone raved about the pancakes - red velvet 5 stars, orange something - not my fav but they rated them a 5, banana cream pie ( my favorite!)   The Kalua pig eggs Benedict - 3 stars, and although everyone raves about them, I wasn't :(. My muffin was soooooo soggy which made the entire thing just a big wet mess.   Service - improved over last time- but this place really needs to step it up a bit - engage your patrons and discuss the uniqueness of the menu.   I can't wait to try another round of pancakes!",

He sampled a bit of everything and didn't find one thing he didn't love.  He is Hawaiian and the menu was very island 'ish!  Portuguese sausage and Kalua Pig all over the menu!  Pork Lovers Delight!  He LOVED the Portuguese Sliders, actually said they were the best breakfast item he's ever eaten!  My \"build your own\" omelet was okay, a little think with the eggs and I didn't love the chicken.  I'm not a pork eater so my meat selection was slim.  The Red Velvet pancakes were delicious but one and a half was enough for me because they are SO sweet!  Jamie was a great server!  I will be back and my husband is trying to figure out what time he has to leave for work so he has time to drive across town to get breakfast here!",

    "text": "BabyStacks Cafe helps to remind me that you can still get great breakfast grub in the city that never sleeps. The only miss on 5 stars is the cramped seating, but I understand their need with their long wait times.  We first ate here on a Saturday morning, and almost turned away because of the wait, but I'm sure glad that we stuck around for the 15 minutes, because it was well worth it. While their seating area is small, and crowded in some places, the overall feel is great, and the attention to customer needs in flawless.  The big pull factor for me is their food. I've been there three times, and each time I've gotten different flavors of pancakes. I've always gone with their Mexican Skillet, which is tasty, salty, a little spicy with some fresh Jalapenos, and the perfect portion. I like that they offer the option to upgrade all the buttermilk pancakes that come with a breakfast to the \"premium flavors\". I've had the red velvet, orange creamsicle, pumpkin, s'mores, and carrot cake. (I go with my wife, we each get a different one and share). They are so good, I could order these for desert after a meal!   All in all, a great place. We've had all three locations, and there are no flukes, the food and employees are consistent. If you're looking for a great place, and you love pancakes, this is right up your alley!",

Always nice to get away from the strip and check out a locals place.   There were many tasty sounding options and it took me a while to decide! It's cool to be able to order a skillet or omelet and have the side as a specialty pancake option.   I chose the Piglet skillet: crunchy potatoes, good melted cheddar, eggs cooked as ordered, sausage, ham, and bacon. Pancake choice was rocky road short stack, which I didn't love (but it was still good) because the chocolate overpowered the almonds and marshmallows.   The coffee was a basic weaker brew and the tea only green or black. So for a breakfast place, found myself wishing for better hot drink choices.   Good friendly service was appreciated.   The bathrooms are a bit grimy.   Overall would try again because several pancake choices caught my eye and I would like to give them a try.",

    "text": "Okay, right off the bat I need to state that I am a Goin-Out-TO-Breakfast fiend. It is my favorite meal to eat out. It's simple. It's relaxing. It's friendly. It's a uncomplicated. A good breakfast joint still offers value, a sense of community and belly full of warm yummy goodness.  I learned to appreciate the beauty of a great breakfast joint at a place called the Red Hill Coffee Shop in Rancho Cucamonga Ca. Side note; It used to be just Cucamonga but then the powers that be got together and decided that tacking a Rancho on the front made it sound less looney tunish...... Nice try. So Red Hill Coffee Shop is the breakfast that all breakfast joints are judged by in my little world. And one of the things, among many, that place it on that oh so lofty pedestal are the hashbrowns.  Their hashbrowns are the shredded variety. Wonderfully crispy and brown on the outside and tender and moist on the inside. Each bite giving you that beautiful contrast of textures and when you get a little bit of the egg or syrup in that bite an added dimension of flavor. Another thing that makes the hashbrowns at RHCS so noteworthy; they don't hold back on the portion.  And that brings me to the point of this 2 star review. I live right around the corner from the S Buffalo location of Baby Stacks. I've seen the yelp and other reviews that have praised this place. I've noticed that it's fairly busy. But in Vegas I always take user reviews with a grain of salt. And that grain of salt gets bigger the closer you get to Summerlin. After all, this is the town in which the readers of the RJ consistently name PF Chang's the best Chinese restaurant (?).   So I stopped by BS this morning and ordered a side of hashbrowns to go. I didn't have time to sit down and eat a full breakfast. I figured a side of hashbrowns would be a good bell-weather for me. And I have to say it was. You ever go to a Denny's, which I haven't done in 20 years, and when the food comes you look at the hashbrowns and think, \"Really?\"?  Well in the case of the hashbrowns I got at BS this morning \"Really?\" would have been a stretch. It was a $3.18 smidgen of fried shredded potatoes. My 16 y/o called them an \"epic fail\".   I'm not usually an overly anal person. Obviously I love my hashbrowns but I felt I needed to quantify the ridiculousness of this order of hashbrowns, so I weighed them. With the togo container they weighed in at an anemic 2 oz. $3 for 2 oz of hashbrowns? Really? That's $24 a pound. This review has gone on way too long already to get into the millions of prepared foods that I can get for less than $24 a pound.  BS, I'm sure all your food is as wonderful as your many customers point out. I think it's great that you are a mom and pop business making a go of it. That in and of itself is praiseworthy. But come on, potatoes are cheap. The griddle is always running. It takes little effort to keep the hashbrowns flowing and plentiful. They are a low overhead item that makes people say to their friends, \"Great breakfast joint, and you should see the hashbrowns.\"  Long after the trendy red velvet thing has passed, people will still love going out to breakfast.",

The restaurant is pretty tight, as in it was a little small. We arrived around lunch time so there was a good amount of people when we arrived. We were seated, however, right away which definitely deserves an A+. Our waitress was super friendly and attentive the entire time. Food came out pretty quick so A+ for that as well. On to the food... first the red velvet pancakes.. was I expecting red velvety battered goodness? Yes. Did I get it? No. They were pretty much pancakes with red food coloring topped with whipped cream and sprinkled with mini chocolate chips. Nothing mind blowing. The cream cheese syrup tasted like the icing you would find in a store bought cinnaroll can. Once again, nothing special. For me, total fail to the excitement I had before I actually tasted them. Now on to the saviour of this review... the adobo omellett. It was a hefty size. I was expecting more egg than filling but thankfully I was wrong. It was chockful of yummyness! The rice tossed with the adobo sauce and shredded chicken were delightful for my taste buds. The creamy side Mac salad was a great addition to the dish. All in all I had an ok experience. I chose 3 stars based on the fact that I was expecting to have my taste buds blown away... but all I got was a fizzle. Maybe red velvet TASTING pancakes are like the loch ness monster... just a myth.",

    "text": "\"Waaaaaiting is the hardest part.\"    Tom Petty says it best, when he sings the chorus to his song \"The Waiting.\" This also sums up the experience you'll have at BabyStacks.    There is no doubt that BabyStacks has the biggest selection of creative pancakes in town.  The panacea of pancakes changes often, but expect to find staples like Red Velvet, Lemon-Ricotta, and S'mores on the menu when you dine.  Besides lots of pancakes, BabyStacks also stays True to it's Hawaiian roots with breakfast grinds like Loco Moco, Spam fried rice, and Kahlua Pork omelets.    The place is very small, and can feel cramped, especially during a busy weekend rush.  If you don't have the sweet tooth of a five year old, you may want to pass on the pancakes, and go for something savory.  On my last visit, I kept it simple, and went with some scrambled eggs, potatoes, sausage, and toast.  Everything was good, not great, and for the 30 minutes we waited  to get our food, after waiting about 20 to sit down, and another 10 for our coffee, it just wasn't worth it.   Breakfast doesn't need to be a whole production, and the food isn't good enough to warrant the wait and the potential cramped seating.    BabyStacks is worth trying, but not frequenting.",

My husband had the strawberry crepes and he said it tasted good but he wished there was fresh strawberries inside the crepes too instead of just on top of it. The wait staff was also friendly. I would definitely go back and try something different.",

I decided to mix things up and get the corn beef hash which turned out to be a mediocre meal. Remember to upgrade your meal to get the speciality pancakes for about $2 is totally worth it. Dont forget to upgrade to garlic rice if your meal doesn't include adobo fried rice. They have a great selection of specialty made pancakes but known for their red velvet pancakes. I'm a big chocolate fan so I'll try to get a chocolate based pancake.   Fyi it's a breakfast place and they normally close at 2 pm!! They will not seat you until all of your party is present and will split credit cards checks.",

All the other people in the restaurant were either white or asian and were all served before us. The table next to us who ordered about 5mins before us was served, paid their check, and the table was cleaned and set up by the time HALF of our food finally came out at 950am. I told the server we would no longer be eating there and it seemed like she could care less. She said she would get the manager and we waited for 5 mins before getting up and walking out.

I don't like this temporary new earlier schedule of ours. Having breakfast at breakfast time really sucks with the wait times and dampens the mood.  We had zippys chili omelette on the specials white board. It's pretty decent and a bit different. I never really thought about chili on eggs, but it makes sense.   I did a make your own skillet - potatoes with your choice of toppings (1 meat, 2 veggies, 1 cheese) and you can add additional toppings to the base price. I did carnitas, peppers, onions, pepper jack cheese and asked for green sauce on the side. It was decent, but different from most skillets that seem cooked together, this is more thrown on top and put in the broiler to melt the cheese.   We got our babystacks that come with our breakfast upgraded to their two new flavors on the white board. We did butterfinger which was rather nice and the butter finger pieces slightly melted were more peanutty in flavor and some parts crunchy. The creamsicle was decent, but I don't know if I'm just not a fan of orange flavored baked goods.   Service was alright. It took a while for someone to come see us and order but once we did food came out pretty quickly . Server and host were both friendly.   Yep. Same consistency of food as the original which is good. Sometimes it doesn't happen that way with new locations. Same food with possibly less of a wait!",

Yeah I took a bite out of everyone's plate around me. :D   The service was great, my water was never empty, and I tend to drink a LOT of water at places. Loved every bit of food I had tasted and cannot wait to try more!  Oh the short stack really filled me up, I was extremely hungry, but for some reason I felt it was better to go on the lighter side, and I still felt full, albeit  I had a few extra bites of other things as well.",

The chicken adobo fried rice and garlic rice option for breakfast specials (Sinangag in Filipino) made me and my galpal feel right at home!   I honestly can't believe we waited this long before hitting Babystacks. It's an all-rounder, service and food were both wins! And even better, the lines weren't hauntingly tedious like we dreaded them to be. Took us less than 5 minutes to be seated but don't buy our case as fact. I have a feeling that certain days will be busier than others, seeing as people come in families, not just in pairs/singles.   Due to unavailable table seating (yep, they had to re-arrange tables to accommodate parties of 4-6), we were led to the bar where we tuned in to the morning news. I don't remember us waiting long before we ordered. We were pretty ready to rock & roll and devour! Servings are pretty decent (I'd say large for us, Asians) and we shared the Corned Beef Hash with Sunny Side up Eggs, wheat bread and the savory, buttery Garlic Rice, also known as Sinangag in Filipino.   On top of that, we figured it would be a waste to not try one of their specialty pancakes. As Hazlenut/Nutella lovers, we debated whether to get the Hazlenut pancakes or the more well-known Red Velvet stack. We ended up with the former and beamed as they got to our counter drizzled with nutella, crushed almonds and whipped cream. Holy moly, were they pretty - and I don't know if you could use this word for pancakes - chunky! A whole spoonful would take a while to chew on and swallow without the help of a drink. Milk did the magic. Soon enough, we had to stop before the they filled us up to our throats.   Babystacks impressed me, especially since one would not decipher the cultural fusion that occurs until you get a glance at the menu!",

It's got a unique / filipino flair to it with their Portuguese sausage, adobo omelette thing (side note: it's not really an omelette). They had a special Kalua Pork Sliders or something like that when I was there.  Nearly everything comes with pancakes and they have a ton of different kinds from S'mores to Rocky Road to Banana Cream Pie to Red Velvet, etc. The list goes on, but your stomach will not. It's only $1.50 to upgrade your regular pancake order to one of their fancier ones...and I'd recommend that if I were you.  I got the Mexican omelette ($9.25), which was awesome. It comes with 4 eggs in the omelette. It also has the option of either seasoned potatoes or hash browns...I opted for the hash browns on a spur of the moment decision, but I think I'd go for the seasoned potatoes next time. They're not huge pieces of dry potatoes, but really crispy, smaller pieces that make them perfect. I made that mistake, but you live and you learn. My friend got toast with her omelette...not sure if it was a side of toast or somehow it came with her meal, but when they give you toast, they don't mess around...she had 6 1/2 bread slices (so 3 whole slices for those not good at math). And they're huge pieces  Anyways, it's about 5 miles off the strip, but definitely worth the drive for something a little more local and delicious and different.",

Can't miss the signage outside tho. Totally feeling their logo.  For a Friday, there was a lunch rush especially since it closes early. Wait wasn't too bad, took about 10mins which gave us time to check out their menu.  Everyone's been raving about their red velvet pancakes so we got that. Not bad, wasn't as red as I was expecting, a bit dry but the cream cheese frosting/syrup saved it. Someone in our party got the chocolate chip pancakes but they were underwhelming --nothing special.   For my main meal, I got their version of the loco moco. Maybe it was my fault for getting it with egg whites but something just wasn't right about it. I did like the fact that I had the option of getting it with garlic fried rice tho. Probably won't get it again.   For so far off the strip, not sure if I'd come back unless I was with people that are dying to check it out.",

If you are going to splurge get the Red Velvet or Cookies and Cream.    Only three stars because they are just pancakes and the other items are average.",

The OJ is completely overpriced, so grab a cup of coffee and prepare to feast on some of the most incredible cakes to ever cross your lips.   Great, now I want some :D",

I expressed that I don't need them to open the containers and they STILL do it. Smh! After all the theatrics I would expect nothing to be missing like utensils or syrup for my pancakes but that's not the case. Make sure to remind them of what you need to eat your meal. I have tried several items on the menu and they hit on really good quality about 3 out of 5 times hence the rating. I keep going back for convenience. Favorite dish is the honey French toast when it doesn't come soggy. Thanks for reading.",

    "text": "Before we finished our Babystacks from yesterday, it had already been decided that we would be making a repeat the following day. The only thing that changed was the location. The food at Babystacks is so good that it haunts you in your dreams. It also causes memories of happy times spent eating to dance around in your brain. If you are not a foodie it will convert you into a foodie. I was already a foodie though. Today's line up consisted of 2 Loco Mocos, Baby Chick Omelette, Seasoned Potatoes, 2 Banana Foster Short stacks, and Butterscotch Short stack. Once again it was all a hit. I tried to deviate from the loco mock and was all set to order the Portuguese sausage and eggs but I couldn't sit back and watch my friend enjoy her loco moco. I needed my eggs coated in savory gravy. Seriously, next visit I am trying other stuff because it is all guaranteed to taste good anyway. I swear they have baby angels in the kitchen sprinkling little dashes of heaven on the plates. The baby chick omelette and butterscotch pancakes were great as was the seasoned potatoes. It is always good when a restaurant can add just the right amount of seasoning without making the food taste salty. Now you maybe wondering why 4 stars instead of 5...let me catch you up to speed. The service: 5. The food: 2375. The 4: a result of this location charging for every little thing and refusal to split checks. For the baby chick omelette, my friend asked for salsa and was told it would be an additional charge. The location yesterday did not charge and brought 2 different types for her to use. Even IHOP provides free salsa as does any other restaurant I can think of. Also, what is up with not splitting checks? People dine out all the time and split checks. Not everyone carries cash and these days mostly everyone has a card. Not allowing the option to split checks is an inconvenience. Alright I have said my 2 cents.  In conclusion, Babystacks is addicting. You have been warned.",

I have heard a lot of good things about BabyStacks (especially that they have Filipino/Hawaiian dish for breakfast) but they are always busy. The few times I tried going, the wait was over an hour.   So Saturday morning, I woke up at 7am and made my way to an awesome breakfast. If there is something worth waking up to early on a Saturday morning, it's BabyStacks.   Let me just say, they have the best red velvet pancake I have ever had. I am not super sold on Red Velvet altogether but I fell in love with their pancakes. It was moist and delicious. It was just pure perfection. I also ordered the famous Lolo Rick's Adobo fried rice with a side of Portuguese sausages. It was good but I thought the adobo would taste like the adobo I used to eat growing up. I guess I set myself up for my own disappointment. I still liked it and I think it is worth the try.   I would definitely be coming back to BabyStacks. I might even give the place right next to them a try if the next time they are packed. I saw that they the offer traditional Filipino breakfast, so excited for that. I can't wait to come back!",

Our waitress Cassandra was the absolute worst server we ever had at this restaurant and one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had. She served 3 out of the 5 people at our table while me and my little brother waited for food for about 10mins. While the others were half way finished she passed our table about 3 times without checking up on us or letting us know what was holding up. Finally she decided to come check up on us and fix the issue. When my brother received his food it looked like she just had told the cook to make it due to it being hot off the stove and the pancakes I got were disgustingly cold while everyone else at the table got theirs hot. After we got our check she had mentioned she discounted my pancakes because I didn't touch them because I was so upset to the point where I had lost my appetite! While we were cashing out we had asked to revise the check because she charged us for a side plate we ordered and didn't receive. Then I had asked for a manager and she stated she was the manager and knowing damn well she wasn't I still had told her about my experience and she said I'm sorry but I don't know what to say. WHAT TYPE OF RESTAURANT MANAGER HAS THIS LITTLE PROFESSIONALISM?! I will never go back to this location again. It was not worth the 20min wait for seating and the disrespect I received after today.",

Although the food was good, the service was lack luster. I had to ask the server (who was barely ever seen) for things such as butter, syrup, and more water. That's one of my biggest pet peeves, when a server drops off pancakes and doesn't leave any butter or syrup! It's a pancake!! Butter and syrup is crucial. Although my red velvet pancakes were tasty, the service was enough to ensure that I won't be coming back.",

The restaurant was so hot and stuffy and people were blocking the entrance, you couldn't even pay your bill if you wanted to just go. A bunch of us waited forever before we can get to the cashier. WON'T be coming back and making sure the word gets around. VERY DISAPPOINTING VISIT. Food is not good anymore like it used to be.. SUPER OVER RATED.

I also enjoy their seasoned potatoes! I always get them when I go there. The loco moco is delicious as well as the adobo fried rice stuffed in an omelet. SOO GOOD. Their skillets are also pretty good. I tried my boyfriend's one time. It was a little spicy because of his tabasco sauce but obviously that is something that can be controlled.

Usually I can see why, but not this time.  If they weren't so small they may not have the rule of not seating until your whole party is there. I knocked off a star for that.  The crepes are delicious. They have made me a Nutella fan. I have fought for years against it. Then I tried it with strawberries, and then bananas. Both set it off nicely.  The rest of the menu is varied with some specialty dishes I've never seen. Everyone raves about them, I've had some bites. They are very good, but I'd have to give up a crepe for them, so a bite or two do me just fine.  If you get there before nine there's no wait. After nine you will wait 15 to 20 min.  The waitresses are ok, nothing to scream about. They keep the tasty hood coffee coming, sometimes after a wait of 5 min or so. To me that's unacceptable. So another star gone.  That being said we've been there every Sunday for almost three months. Lol",

The servers were very attentive and food came out at a decent time. The food was so delicious! If you're a person who doesn't always finish your food (like me), get any short stack pancakes for only about $6. I decided to get the Cinnabun pancakes and they were *italian finger kiss* really good.",

I really love restaurants that are local and not just another chain restaurant which is what Babystacks is; a great local place. This place is always busy so if you don't want to wait make sure you get there early; especially on the weekends! The pancakes are amazing as well as the omelettes and skillets. My favorite pancake there has to be either the infamous Red Velvet or Butterfinger. It's two hard to decide between the two! My goal is one day try every single pancake :) The great thing about this restaurant is you can still get an omelette or skillet and still be able to have a side of their delicious pancakes. My favorite skillet is the Mexican skillet. If you like spicy this is a must try! I would recommend this restaurant to anyone who is a breakfast food lover and wanting to experience delicious food and great service!",

I just HATE the fact that this delicious breakfast place is literally ONE MINUTE from my house while I'm on this dreaded diet! Other than that, it's also love that it's so close.   From the outside, this place doesn't look like much. In fact, I was never curious about what this place was until my bestie invited me here for breakfast. BUT, as soon as you step in, you seriously feel like a character on Animal Crossing. The inside is SHO CUTE! It has an adorable and homey ambience that I just love! The service was also great and friendly!   If you're looking for a great breakfast/brunch I suggest opting out for the skillets! They have so many combinations and possibilities for them. They also come with pancakes that you can replace with special pancakes for only ONE DOLLAH! I know that everyone talks about their Red Velvet pancakes, but I'm not a huge fan of chocolatey goodness first thing in the morning (ironic I know). Instead, I am in love with their CARROT PANCAKES! Give them a chance! They are delish! I always ask for the cream-cheese syrup on the side. They are fluffy and cooked to absolute perfection. Their BANANA CREAM pancakes are also delicious! It tastes just like an actual banana cream pie (amazing I know).   As a huge fan of french toast, I'm definitely looking forward to trying it here on my next visit! If you're looking for a great little breakfast place, BabyStacks is the way to go! I always leave here with a food coma!",

    "text": "If I had to rank the meals in the day, Breakfast would be dead last for me.  There are a few reasons for this:   1) My lactose intolerance limits a lot of the cheesy/milky items I would normally want to order, and I don't like starting my day with an angry tummy.   2) I usually don't have time (weekdays) or motivation (weekends) to really go anywhere to grab something.  On this Sunday, I had to drop off a friend who had a little too much to drink last night as well as a tux rental to Men's Wearhouse, and decided it seemed like a good day to try a breakfast place I'd heard a lot about.  You know, carpe diem and all that.  Upon walking into Babystacks, I wasn't surprised to see a large crowd sitting around waiting for a table, and we signed in and were told it'd be a 15-25 minute wait.  Quick sidenote: While we were seated near the door, my friend pointed out a black widow spider crawling along the floor that went underneath our bench.   I did the good Samaritan deed and promptly stood up and switched seats.  It looked harmless, really.    Once seated I ordered an orange juice which I'd forgotten was so expensive when eating out.  I naturally ordered a full order of Red Velvet pancakes, because if I'm going to blow up my insides with lactose goodness, I'm going all the way.  A short time later I was presented with a beautiful plate of 6 huge, red pancakes with the fixings.  The first bite was heaven, and 15 minutes later, the last bite was heaven.  I can't really add anything that probably hasn't already been said about them.   The rumors are True, the hype is justified, the pancakes are freaking delicious.  Next time I would switch it up and probably just get a 1/2 order with some side order of something savory.  The couple next to us ordered some sort of skillet or plate with some lovely pieces of cooked animal flesh that were really disarming to me as I continuously shoved my mouth full of candy in pancake form.   Yes, next time I need bacon with my candy.  Service was fine, though it did take a little while for the waitress to take our order after we got our drinks.  Obviously it was packed so I was understanding of it, and once the food arrived, no complaints.  The prices are very reasonable.    Now I just need one closer to my house that delivers, and breakfast can be making a strong case for being #2 after dinner.",

I had tried BabyStacks before with my sister and found it mediocre. Part of my distaste was due to their lack of proper staffing and attention to their guest. With an additional location, it reduces the wait time and the business for both locations.   Our server, Mikey was nice. Came around, took our orders, refilled my water. Another girl came around and offer me refills when she saw my cup empty. The service is not the focus of my dislike of this place. It was the food.  I got the Red Velvet Pancakes as my meal. A full stack of these hot cakes is overkill. They come out with six large disks topped with chocolate chips, whipped cream, and their cream cheese frosting. A few bites in and my teeth were feeling achy. The syrup was unnecessary since the pancakes are already too sweet on their own. I finished two of the six and was done. My friend was insistent on getting a half order of pb & chocolate chip pancakes and a eggs and sausage plate. The pancakes are heavy and the savory items are just average. Their eggs are executed well and the hash browns had a nice golden crisp.",

I had a skillet combo and upgraded to banana foster pancakes. I had the same problem with my eggs also being cold and I found the skillet to be rather bland. You could tell that the pancakes had been sitting out for a while because they weren't very warm and the whipped cream on top was pretty much a liquid by the time I got them. To top it off they don't split checks so that was a bit of a inconvenience considering none of us carry cash. May go in one day just to give it another shot, but I doubt it.",

Our waitress got mine and my boyfriend's order wrong and we told her that we wanted the adobo fried rice with a side of hash browns because we couldn't do a full stack of pancakes as a side. Instead she gives us all of that and a side of two pancakes. We said we didn't order that and she had the nerve to argue with us saying we did order it and she did ask. She couldn't even be nice enough to take it away but instead made us keep it. She also impolitely told our table that they don't split checks and it was posted on the door. Sorry your handwritten small sign wasn't enough to catch our attention. I don't understand why this place doesn't split checks when I used to before. I don't plan on coming back anytime soon.",

We came around 1 in the afternoon, so we avoided the typical breakfast/brunch/lunch rush hours. We were seated immediately and received good service throughout. Nothing super, but solid.  As soon as I looked at the variety of pancakes on the menu and on the specials board, I got excited. So many choices! I ended up going with an omelette with chili verde on it to go with 2 peanut butter and banana pancakes. The omelette itself was OK; it had all the elements of an omelette, but wasn't particularly fluffy. It was solid. The pancakes, though, were great! I am a sucker for both peanut butter and bananas, so maybe it wasn't that hard to impress me, but nonetheless, they were delicious. I also tried my friend's pancakes banana foster, which were one of the daily specials. He had ordered a large stack of pancakes (6 pancakes) and was overwhelmed by what came out. Those pancakes were pretty tasty and were pretty much like dessert.  What really interested me when I went to the restroom was the spam sandwich on a sweet roll that I saw in a newspaper review of BabyStacks. I'll be coming back, and that will most likely be what I order.  Solid breakfast/brunch destination; I'll definitely come back when I'm in Vegas.",

I had the Spam scramble which was good.  The Furikake on top really cut through the saltiness of the Spam.  The scramble came with a side of pancakes, I got the white chocolate macadamia pancakes.  They were good but the white chocolate macadamia part of the pancakes was on top and it was difficult to get a perfect bite.  Otherwise they were just regular pancakes with toppings.  My friend and I shared the red velvet pancakes and OMG they are to die for!  I woke up in my bed in Sacramento the next day craving those pancakes.  The cream cheese syrup wasn't too sweet.  It was just right and the red velvet pancakes were so fluffy.  I wish I had just gotten those pancakes by themselves.  GET THE RED VELVET PANCAKES EVERYONE!",

    "text": "Las Vegas Yelpers, you guys rock for sharing about a great place like Babystacks!  We're from the SF Bay Area and we've had a few visits to Las Vegas the past year.  We're so over the usual stuff and just wanted to find a good breakfast that wasn't on the strip.  We Yelpers know that some of the best food can be found off the beaten path, right?  So my trusty Yelp App not only roped me in with an eye catching menu that had pancake choices like Smores, Banana Creme Pie, Red Velvet (cue eye pop here) but it also told me that this place is about 15 minutes from our hotel.  Sweet!  Off we go in our rental.  Probably because we went on a weekday, we didn't experience a lengthy wait as mentioned in the other reviews.  During the 5 minutes we did have to hang out, I noticed the clean, casual & laid back surroundings with a bit of an island touch.  Cute butterflies everywhere.  I also saw the specials on the board and I knew I was in for a dilemma.  Almond Joy pancakes?  Orange creamsicle pancakes?  I asked for a menu to have an early look but by that time we were ready to be seated.  I got the Lemon Ricotta pancakes.  It only comes in one size, and the order was HUGE.  The cream cheese syrup made each bite delightfully sweet and really went with the lemony, fluffy pancake. My leftovers: <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RIYUD4i-_sPDH597B92DXg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The huzbeau ordered the Kalua Pork Eggs Benedict.  I liked my pancakes, but I was coveting his plate the whole time.  The pork was tender and nicely salted with perfectly poached eggs.  I've never had this rendition of Eggs Benedict before and its a work of genius!  If it were me though, I'd throw in some spam in there (which I did order on the side; comes with two slices).  Note to self for the next time.  And I'm definitely getting my own. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=wgy9HFmRWyhY8IupO76RHw&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>  The Keikis enjoyed a short stack of Almond Joy pancakes (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?select=RziSeEnGuGZ-SfEMFhZXrg&userid=6b-xMDKuXglIDVRf08eKJg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>) and the combo meal that came with bacon, hash browns, eggs and a red velvet baby stack (no picture, sorry...my little girl inhaled it).    Everything was delicious.  We may have ventured off the strip, but we made our own smorgasbord here.  Service was sufficiently friendly and there is plenty of parking.  We will definitely be back when we visit this area again!",

If they call you in 15 minutes and you're not waiting right there, you're out of luck.   Once we got sat, they rushed us to order. The food arrived cold and burnt; kind of an oxymoron. We had to ask for the additional items we ordered that we never received. We still never got our complete orders but were certainly charged for them. They drop the check with the food and that's where the service, or lack thereof, ends.  While paying my bill, the girl asked how everything was. I noticed the big sign at their host stand that said, \"be nice or leave!\" so I decided to not ruffle any feather since mine already were. With a sign like that, they don't care in the first place.  Oh well. We'll find another place more deserving of our time, money and business.",

It is the place I take friends and travel companions when in town and to a person they are pleased with the meal. That is because the staff members are all pleasant, the food is tasty and prepared quickly.  While everything is good, I recommend ordering the lemon ricotta pancakes (there are enough to share with the \"friend\" you met last night, or flew into town with). The coffee is always hot, fresh, smooth, and your cup will never be empty.  Don't be put off by the simple exterior and location.  This place has the feel of a family run restaurant (and probably is) and they make everyone feel comfortable and welcome. Oh, and did mention I love this place because the food is oh so good.  So, if you are a Vegas local, give it a try.  If you are a visitor to Sin City, make a tiny extra effort, travel west on Flamingo and turn south on Buffalo.  It is on the corner just south of a drug store in a strip mall.  Pull in, walk in, enjoy. There are two locations in Vegas, but the one on the corner of Flamingo and Buffalo is the location I am familiar with.",

    "text": "BabyStacks is one of my fave breakfast joints.   It's right up the street from our house so it could be super convenient. I'll touch on that later.  The main thing I love is the creative selection of their pancakes and that they have specials of them occasionally too! The Red Velvet made them famous and for good reason but I urge you to stray away and try some of the other yummy pancakes! The second thing I love is that you can get a full breakfast platter for under $10. The works, a little bit of everything. Eggs, potatoes, toast, SPAM :) and pancakes. An up charge for a special flavor but it's not much. I like when I don't have to choice my favorite breakfast components or spend a fortune on getting all the additional sides.   They opened a location on South Buffalo because this location became so popular and it is super small. Which comes to my gripe with BabyStacks, not because there is a wait but because every time I go or call ahead to check the wait time, it is ALWAYS off sometimes in my favor, sometimes not but it drives me crazy. You may be busy but you are also turning people away. Get your table times in check. It's breakfast your table time should be about an hour, hour and half for a chatty table. You should be able to quote tables based on that time frame. I'll still visit but it is definitely not as often as I would like it to be because of this.   Maybe another location on the East or Southeast side will spread the love out.",

They're pancakes are way better than Stacks n Yolks and I feel they have a bigger selection. The lemon ricotta pancakes are so ono (delicious...I'm from Hawai'i) One of my favorites, as well as Lolo Rick's adobo fried rice.",

    "text": "I heard amazing things about babystacks and was finally able to try it today. There was a 25 min wait for a party of 4 around 1 PM. When we left around 2 PM there was no wait and the restaurant was pretty empty. Service was good, waiter checked in on us and refilled our waters without us asking.   My friend got the fried rice adobo which was too salty for her but she said the egg and some ketchup and hot sauce saved it. She also added the smores pancake on the side for $1.50 more. I got the kahlua pig Benedict with hash browns and it was definitely lacking some flavor. I had my friend try a piece and she agreed that It needed some hot sauce and salt.   Portion sizes are big, especially if you're adding on a pancake! It's about the same size as their normal orders but instead of 3 or 6, you get 2.   Brunch for 4 was $50 which isn't bad at all!  I know babystacks is known for their pancakes so it was probably a mistake ordering things that weren't pancakes. We will stick to pancakes from now on.",

I've always liked red velvet cupcakes/cakes, but cluelessly had never thought of it being made into different forms of carb goodness.   Baby Stacks is a normal looking breakfast joint in a normal looking shopping mall, but what lurks inside is NOT normal. The food here has a bit of a Hawaiian influence that results in an AWESOME party in your mouth ;)   We each ordered from the \"Breakfast Favorites.\" The hub had the \"bacon and eggs\" and chose hash browns and buttermilk babystacks. I had their \"Portuguese sausage and eggs\" and chose rice and their specialty RED. VELVET. BABYSTACKS. The hub said his breakfast was good, but you can get what he ordered anywhere else that serves breakfast. My order on the other hand was absolutely FANTASTIC! There's no way to describe the joy and utter elation I felt when those red velvet cakes hit my tongue *cue foodgasm noise.* Done deal, 5 stars! As soon as those stacks hit the table I pounced and I pounced hard! Oh man, I can't wait to have them again. They're perfectly done and when you add the cream cheese icing/syrup with the gorgeously whipped cream, it's utter food heaven.   So, what have we learned? Don't come here for a \"normal\" breakfast and get here fast because this place fills up quick! And please, please don't say I didn't warn you when you fall in love at first bite ;)",

(IMO anyway) :p   Friendly staff and lots of Hawaiian inspired dishes. I just love the aloha vibe here which makes sense since Vegas is the 9th island. Zippy's chili (If you've been to HI before then you already know what I'm taking about), portuguese sausage with garlic rice, macadamia pancakes, spam & eggs, adobo fried rice omelette, and the list goes on. It's easy to see why baby stacks stands out from the pack. So Ono!   Another notable mention are the red velvet pancakes. But my all time favorite are the bananas foster pancakes. OMG!!!

While the gravy was okay, the biscuits were hard, the gravy was under-seasoned, the hashbrowns were not appetizing at all, and the eggs tasted like they came out of a box. The coffee was not even that great.  I would honestly pass on this restaurant and if you're in a pinch, head to an IHOP. At least you'll get a more appetizing meal than the one you'd get here.",

    "text": "Service is horrible!   We came in and waited patiently to be seated and another party of four walk in and they seat them right away. I say something to the person who sat them and he said I didn't know you guys were waiting. My response was I just randomly sit in a restaurant not trying to eat. And he said well I can't ask them to get up since I already sat them.   But we were just super hungry so they sat us at the bar. Our waitress took our order and then we waited for 45 mins before some of our food came.   My friend ordered steak and eggs and my husband ordered country fried steak and my other friend ordered red velvet pancakes. All of which came out before my salad did. When our waitress brought out their food she said the salad was going to be right out. Fifteen mins later my salad still didn't come out. So I asked our waitress what happened to my salad. And her answer was I don't know the kitchen is all confused back there.   So I told her if it's not coming out now cancel it I'll just eat somewhere else because everyone else I am with are basically done eating.   When we got our bill you figure she would have discounted something for the issue but nothing. Then when I went to pay in front and the guy asked me how everything was she still didn't say anything.   The food was okay nothing amazing but I don't think I will be coming back! Horrible was terrible",

Considering we're in the city that never sleeps, after a good night of fun we were all famished the next morning. By word of mouth, we made a visit to BabyStacks and they did not disappoint! My girlfriend and I ordered their most popular dishes, the Loco Moco and the Adobo Omelette with a side of Red Velvet Pancakes. Everything was so tasty!! My friends also ordered the Banana Pancakes and that was filling, but flavorful as well.",

There is quite a wait on weekends, so arrive early or not terribly hungry! It's worth it though, I promise. The service is great - servers always attentive and friendly.   My regular order is usually the spam scramble with garlic fried rice and a side of specialty pancakes. I know it's kind of basic, but I can't help it - it's such comfort food! The furikake sprinkled on top of the rice and eggs is such a nice touch. You also can't go wrong with the pancakes. I've tried many of them (my own and bites off other people's plates) and they're always fluffy and delicious. I believe it's two pancakes you get when it's a side to another entree, which I think is just enough without making you TOO full.",

    "text": "The reviews for this place intrigue us to check it out while we were visiting LV.  This place is in a strip mall and had a line out the door.  This is what I like to see.  That means it's worth the wait. There was only two of us, so our wait was shorter than most.  The hostess told us it'd be between 20-30 minute wait.  We waited maybe 10.  Reviews insist you upgrade to the garlic rice.  I love the Hawaiian breakfast -- loco moco.  For those who don't know what that is, it's rice with a hamburger patty covered in brown gravy and topped with eggs.  I prefer mine over easy.  Gosh, I love loco moco so I was excited to see it on the menu.  Because of the garlic rice recommendation, I decided to do so.  Hind sight, I would've just got straight up rice.  Garlic rice was too strong for me, and I'm a garlic lover.  Other than that it was delicious.  They also asked if I wanted toast or pancakes to go with my meal.  I chose toast, I knew I was going to have plenty to eat!  Toast was cooked perfectly golden brown.  A pet peeve of mine if it's not toasted correctly.    My husband by the recommendation of the server ordered the corn beef hash with pancakes.  21 flavors to choose from on the pancakes--yes 21 flavors!  Hubby ordered the banana fosters and it was delicious!!!!  The corn beef hash was top notch as well.    We left full and satisfied.  Service was fast and friendly. Will definitely come back for breakfast next time we are in Vegas!  I will have a place to get my loco moco fix :)",

    "text": "SO cheap and absolutely delicious food. Highly recommend making the drive out for some tasty bites! Babystacks is a cult favorite and I'm so glad my AirBnB was close enough to this place since I rarely ever make the drive off the strip if I'm always on it.   * PARKING * Located in a plaza with plenty of (unshaded) parking.  * WAIT TIMES * On a Sunday brunch session, BabyStacks is certainly quite busy but none too much that we didn't get seated for longer than 15 minutes. The restaurant itself is rather small which is what largely amounts to the wait time but as I said, I went during peak hours and still got seated quickly.  * FOOD *  Strawberry & Nutella pancake stack: DELICIOUS!!! There were so many options that I wanted to try out but I'm so glad I ordered this because the pancakes were fluffy, the strawberries were a-plenty, the cream was soft, and the drizzled hazelnuts certainly made for a wonderful dining experience.   Bacon eggs and cheese omelette: my boyfriend had this and quite enjoyed it as well. The omelette is cooked with the cheese melted over it and comes with an additional side (hash browns for him) and your choice of toast as well. Overall nothing spectacular but not a terrible choice either if you're looking to have this plate.   * SERVICE * Our server was sweet but doesn't seem to do her job very well when she's stacked with a full section. Our friend had ordered plain rice and she still managed to serve him garlic fried rice. Even after acknowledging the mistake, she still charged him for the garlic fried rice even though she said she wouldn't... Also, it took forever for us to receive our check so we didn't find it in our interest to argue our bill.   * OVERALL * I certainly enjoyed my meal here enough to warrant a second visit. And because babystacks is located off the strip, I know it won't ever get as busy and I can always pop in whenever I please. This is definitely a must for your visit in Vegas, so consider adding it to the bucket list!",

This time I came with my mom since she wanted to try a different place that wasn't on the Strip.    As much as I loved their Adobo and Rice Omelette last time I was there, I wanted to try something different this time, however I wasn't in the mood for their pancakes since I wanted something more savory.  The Hawaiian Benedict definitely caught my eye on the menu so I ordered that while my mom decided on their Kalbi Beef & Eggs.  Hawaiian Benedict -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vLHkJQ&s=d959f7626e510024cb950efabf5ab67cd51bf892d3cec9bae9742ef64c47546d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vLHkJQ</a> Hawaiian Sweet Rolls, Spam, Eggs, Brown Gravy, Furikake This was like a loco moco but with Spam on top of Hawaiian sweet rolls and it was really good!!  I loved how everything was smothered in gravy and how the runny egg yolks oozed over everything as well.  Made for a very comforting meal.  I'd definitely order this again.    Kalbi Beef & Eggs -- <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vLshQl&s=04bf42066a25b16a91bf51b097c61be065b68e715f56e0f4a9c6e8c982071bdd\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vLshQl</a> This was what my mom ordered and she enjoyed it as well.  She gave me one of her kalbi short ribs to try and I thought it was marinated very well and not overcooked.  Great portion size though.  BabyStacks once again delivered as a great breakfast spot.  I'm glad I took my mom here and showed her that there are other great places to eat breakfast off the Strip.  Maybe next time I visit Vegas, I'll stop by again and try their famous pancakes.",

This was our 4th visit here, and we finally figured out how to get the PERFECT meal- order the Loco Moco, and ask for a side of the adobo meat underneath the rice. Trust me, you won't be disappointed. When they ask you for your side? Ask for the lemon ricotta pancakes. We've also had the Kahlua grilled cheese and the cookie butter French toast- both amazing. But, the perfect meal is the loco moco (oh, upgrade to the garlic rice), adobo, and the pancakes. The staff is always super friendly, very helpful, just awesome.",

    "text": "Adobo fried rice wrapped in egg! Sign me up twice. Okay, it's simple. You're from out of town visiting Vegas. You are looking for the breakfast place but do not want to spend all that dough because you want to use most of your money on the craps table. Get in your car and drive a few miles west of the strip.   My bro and I showed up about 9:30am on a Tuesday morning. It was a full house but we were seated immediately. FYI- there is one small table in the back next to the restroom; avoid at all costs. We were almost seated there. I spoke up and we were given another table. You can also sit at the counter. I noticed a few large groups dining together, so they will accommodate. Also, they do not split checks. Time to bust out that calculator and do some arithmetic. If you have that cheap friend who never chips in for taxes or tip, you may need to throw in a few extra bucks.   Menu is full of pancakes on one side. The other side offers their specialties. The first two items listed are the adobo fried rice and loco moco. There was no way I was going to leave that place without ordering both. Each item comes with a choice of potatoes, hash browns, etc. Went with the hash browns. Small order of pancakes comes with the loco moco or you can upgrade to the specialty pancakes for about $2. My bro had the white chocolate chip macadamia nut pancakes and said they were some of the best he has ever had.   The adobo fried rice was excellent. It was interesting to have it wrapped up in egg. I felt like there wasn't a lot of the fried rice inside of the egg. I should have asked for the loco moco with the adobo fried rice. I asked after the meal but they do not serve it that way. The gravy for the loco moco was rich with flavor. The rice was a bit soggy. The hamburger patty was thick and I think they used two eggs.   Overall, food was great. I could have used more of the fried rice and the white rice was a bit soggy but the excellent flavor cancelled out the downfalls. The service was great and to top it off was the price. It was $29 for 2 with drinks and all that food. Give them a try, stuff your face, and then head back to your hotel pool and strut your six-pack. Happy eating!",

Every time I go, I want to try something new, but there's some items on the menu that I ALWAYS have to order! I always get their Strawberry Lemonade (which is refillable) & their red velvet pancakes! I've had red velvet pancakes at other restaurants, but no one does it like BabyStacks! It's not too sweet, and it'll leave you wanting more. The cream & syrup they use is honestly so perfect.   I've ordered everything from omelettes, skillets, crepes, to loco mocos and every dish was just perfect to me. If you're looking for a spot for filling, and great tasting breakfast/lunch, this is where it's at!",

Im not from NV so when we come to visit we always stop by Babystacks in Henderson but this time we were closer to this location so we came and it was underwhelming. The pancakes were just ok which was such a disappointment because that's why we come. I had the white chocolate chip macadamia pancakes. At the Henderson location you don't even really need the syrup but here the pancakes were plain and just stuffed with mac nuts and topped with white chocolate chips but I feel like the one in Henderson is infused with flavor from top to bottom so it was kind of disappointing. That being said it's still a good place If you want some breakfast.",

I'm glad we did because when we were leaving around 10am, there was already a line out the door.  We were greeted and got seated right away.  We ordered the following:  Portuguese sausage omelet with a stack of Red Velvet pancakes ($12).  It had rice, Portuguese sausage, bacon and mushrooms.  Man it was so good!!!  The flavors exploded in my mouth.  I need to find a place near me that can serve this omelet.  The Red Velvet pancakes were so soft, moist and fluffy.  It comes with a cream cheese sauce that was devine.    My daughter ordered the Frankie's Mini Breakfast ($6.25) -it had 1 egg, hash brown and 1 bacon.  My daughter enjoyed it.   We are looking forward to going again.",

Portions are massive (great for sharing) and have a great Hawaiian and Filipino flair with spam, garlic rice and Kalua pork on the menu.   The french toast was spectacular, omelettes were massive and stuffed full of veggies. The entrees all game with great sides, you can even upgrade to a stack of your favorite pancakes! They had all kinds of appealing pancakes, we tried the German chocolate which had nice coconut on top.   I also liked their BLT and the fries had Cajun spice on the top. Bacon was super thick and good quality.   Thanks for the great breakfast!",

The food is delicious but I give them a super low rating cuz I'm tired of the fact that there is an upcharge for ANY modifications, and they NEVER tell u about it. It feels like they're being sneaky. Most other restaurants will tell u when u ask for a substitution or whatever. They will say \"Sure we can do that, it will just be a small additional charge.\" or something like that. Also, it's super busy a lot of the time, so there's a 50/50 chance that you will get good service. So I'm thinking maybe it's not worth it to wait outside or in the cramped waiting area if I'm gambling on the service anyway.",

(I'll go back with her again in case it was just a bad day!)  I was thinking the great reviews would be due to home cooking, light fluffy pancakes and great service.  It was super busy yet I have no complaints about the service.  The food was a whole other thing.  I'm pretty sure the corn beef hash was canned. (think Dinty Moore)  I was surprised the offered potatos with hash and now I know why.  You needed  them to kind of cut the salty mush.  Eggs were fine.  Pancakes came late but the server told me \"they would be up in a couple minutes\".  I figured that would be a bonus because then my pancakes wouldn't get cold while I was eating my eggs.  Nope.  The pancakes came cold.  They were not light and fluffy.  They were also the same size as the plate so with non-absorbant kind of leathery pancakes, the syrup just rolled off on to the table.  I couldn't cut them with a butter knife on their plate so I transfered them to my eggs plate and attempted to get some syrup on them.  It would not soak in. I finally got one pancake cut, dipped a piece in a pool of syrup and a  few drops stuck all the way to my mouth.  Another \"meh\".  cold, flat, tough pancakes just don't do it for me.  Basically, I had two eggs over easy and some frozen hash browns with two bites of \"corned beef\" and a bit of pancake then feigned \"I'm so full\". (not!)",

Ive always wished to find a place where the banana in the pancake doesn't taste fake. I love it. The pancakes come out warm with sauce and whipped cream right on top. The adobo fried rice is so perfect! It's not too salty and it's great with a little bit of ketchup!

I fill up on the red velvet pancakes which I can't find anywhere else or at least can't find it as good as they make it here , even the cream cheese on top of it is excellent. The loco moco is also excellent. I wish I could try everything they have to offer here. Come down you won't regret it !",

    "text": "I came in this morning. Brunch. Servers name was Gerardo. I decided on something different. I usually order breakfast with the cookies n cream pancakes, an Oreo type pancake which is so sweet it needs a side of insulin (that's not a joke). If you order them, get an iced tea, hot coffee, no sugar to offset the sweet.   I had the chili moco which really was perfect for the time of day for me. It's hamburger, eggs, rice, \"Hawaiian\" style chile with onions. I upgraded to have the lemon ricotta crepes. It should come with two slices of lemon to give a nice kick with the icing. I had a glass of water as well. Felt like a perfect brunch. Delightful atmosphere with the bustle of a nice Monday morning.   My boyfriend had iced tea, western skillet, ham, onion,bell pepper, with potato and two eggs over medium. Served with an indifferent salsa, nothing was special very mediocre. No spice. Nothing.   That came with bananas foster pancakes. Bananas needed a bit more time cooking but was enjoyable. They don't need the whipped cream, already rich by themselves. But if you want a sugar rush, scratch that sugary itch, here ya go.   I had a great time as I always have and today was wonderful. Thank you.",

I was intrigued by the red velvet and was super excited to eat it, but it was too buttery for my taste.  Way heavy so I was only able to finish 1.  We got potatoes with our eggs Benedict and everything was good.  Egg was perfectly cooked/runny and the potato bites were crispy.  The only downside was there was too much cheese for my taste.    I've got to say... Most restaurants I go to have funky smelling/tasting water (like they just run it from the sink) but the water here tasted fine and didn't smell at all.  The waitress was also super nice and attentive.  3 stars for food, but an extra star for the water and service.  Plus points for me!",

Today I was there at 9:00 am, the rest of the party was about 15 minutes late.  They would not even take my name and within 15 minutes, we had a 30 minute wait.  Then 7 of us had to walk out and go somewhere else.  I do not plan on ever coming back.  The 7 of pick a place to meet up every month and we will NEVER go back.

    "text": "Wow!  Thanks to Ardie Y, my friends and I found a new breakfast place to eat in Las Vegas.  We came on a Sunday morning and the restaurant was busy; I believe we waited 45 minutes.  Echo the hostess welcomed us and asked for our name.  In the front, there are benches so you can sit while you wait for your table.  I was looking at the menu and there were a lot of tempting breakfast items to choose from.  The pancakes that caught my attention were, carrot, bacon, hazelnut, cinnamon, banana cream pie, orange creamsicle, rocky road,  white chocolate chip macadamia nut, and cookies & cream.  We ordered Rick's Adobo Fried Rice (comes with one side), Portuguese Sausage & Eggs, and Cora's Corned Beef Hash and Eggs.  Then we got pancakes, Banana Foster, Cinnabun, and Red Velvet.    ::Food:: I was curious about Rick's Adobo (traditional Filipino dish) Fried Rice.  The way they served the adobo was creative.  It was wrapped in an omelet, inside was shredded chicken, rice, and garnished with green onions.  I like the concept but the flavor tasted different.  Also, there was more rice than chicken.  The Portuguese sausage and corned beef hash were good, they both came with poached eggs.   (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=xq3LDYJwORo0sqzbVxoN4A\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=qZjei1WxCXIys7U0e88SlA\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=aoK8mlcAZsamPcjWcBaCrg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  ::Highlight:: The PANCAKES!!  The Banana Foster is my favorite.  It was topped with caramelized bananas, whip cream, and cinnamon sugar.  Next is the Red Velvet (best seller), the color of the pancake was bright, it was topped with whipped cream, chocolate crumble and came with a side of cream cheese.  Then we also got the Cinnabon pancake.  It had sweet icing, crunchy pecans, and dusted with cinnamon and sugar.  I would get the Banana Foster, Red Velvet, and Portuguese Sausage & Eggs again!   (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=JElMDZVy-L2K1ZYQVCq3dw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=Kvop5h2qJN_SPR3cM3ygUg\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_local_photos?userid=NO5e0WtLAOYcjheLU6OEVg&start=200&select=VDGIzpViJvGTOL_yE-AaLw\">yelp.com/user_local_phot...</a>)  ::Customer Service:: Echo was very friendly.  We didn't know which pancakes to order but Lilly was very helpful by answering all our pancake questions.    ::Tip:: Remember all parties must be present to be seated.   ::M's Notes:: -Arrive early, it gets busy so anticipate to wait especially on the weekends -Parking lot -Inside seating",

    "text": "I came here ready to stuff my face with the glories of awesomeness. Yeah, I think I went a bit overboard, but it's okay. I can always start dieting tomorrow.   Red velvet pancakes- 5 stars. I still drool thinking about this pancake, because it's like eating cake but in pancake form. The texture is more like a muffin cake rather than a chewy pancake, but it's SOOO GOOOOOOOOOOD. For a sweet tooth like myself, this is heavenly.   Adobo fried rice omelet - 4 stars. The flavoring inside with the rice and adobo is good. I think it could have been a bit saltier, and I think I'd enjoy it more as a fried rice rather than in an omelet since the egg outside dilutes the saltiness inside, making it a bit bland for my taste. I was confused if I'm supposed to put ketchup outside and eat it or should it have been tonkatsu sauce? Maybe that would be more genius.   Side of portugese sausage- 4 stars. Who don't like sausage? OINK OINK. My belly does. I'm no Portuguese sausage connoisseur, but I love a fatty polska kielbasa and this sausage did the job.   Some healthy bacon and all kinds of stuff omelet with avocado on top- 4 stars. I never order omelets at restaurants, because I can make a pretty legit version in my own kitchen. SO, I don't know what to say and how to rate this omelet. It was good, but not something I'd order.   I'm coming back for VELVET PANCAKES!!! WOOOOOO!  Service- 7/5 stars. It's off the charts. I can't even believe how fast my water was filled at quarter point every time. The dude was working real hard and he deserves major credit for it. Stellar service for sure from start to beginning.",

Atmosphere: Warm home feeling, Service: Awesome Prices: reasonable I can imagine this spot being crowded on the weekends, thank goodness it was only Monday. Salivating til our food comes out, I hear my favorite Island tunes. Why can't we have restaurant like this in the bay? (insert sad face)  White Chocolate Macadamia pancakes-OMGEEEEE were so delicious, fluffy and light. Huge portion btw  Kalua Pork eggs benedict-A little too saucy but the pork was on hit! tender and juicy.  Adobo fried rice omelette-Star of the show, and my favorite. Concept is a great idea, I felt like I was eating a huge burrito but we were totally satisfied with every bite.  Amazed with the sweet & savory foods, I would recommend this spot for breakfast!

We were there around 10:00 and it was busy, but I don't think that's an excuse. My food was practically falling off my plate and it wasn't because there was tons of food. It looked pretty unappealing. See picture. I will be back, but I'm hoping this was only a one time thing.",

    "text": "If you are looking for a good breakfast joint that caters to carnivores and sweet toothed mammals alike...look no further than Baby Stacks.  I believe the original location is on Buffalo and Smoke Ranch.  Although, the location that I frequent is the expansion branch on Buffalo and just south of Flaming-O.  Baby Stacks, to me, falls into that Island-Style breakfast category that you can find at Cinnamon's and Boots & Kimo's on the Windward side of Oahu, nestled in beautiful Kailua.  This style consists of the normal comfort breakfasts including spam or pocho sausages with rice and eggs your way in addition to loco mocos, an island favorite.  But specialty benedicts and an elaborate pancake menu is now a common theme in island breakfasts.  I usually get the kalua pork eggs benedict but opted for the grilled cheese kalua pork sandwich on special.  The sandwich was good, but more appealing to the eyeballs than the taste buds.  Also, I have this unquenchable appetite for Tabasco, sue me, and tend to douse my kalua pork and manapuas in it, I'm talking drowning...lol.  If it weren't for my spicy little friend, the meal could have been much worse.  A banana cream pie stack was added and by far my favorite aside from carrot cake pancakes so far.  The white chocolate mac nut is again more name than anything.  My lady went with the zesty chicken omelet and like most onomatopoeia, was exactly that...zesty.  The place is a hit, both locations, so be prepared to wait if you aren't there before the rush.  The place reminds me of home with smiles from local islanders, but, I know for a fact that a lot of mainlanders aren't big on it and the culture, so beware.    Otherwise, decor and ambiance is good and staff is friendly and attentive.  The check out dude has a Filipino accent and a little rough around the edges, so bare with him.  Parking is plentiful and although, not quite on the level of Cinnamon's, the place is definitely worth a look.  The sad thing is that there is no seafood related items on the menu, such as lox and the the like.  I know breakfast is not synonymous with fish, but I came here on a Friday during lent, and my selections were limited.  I had to settle for a spinach omelet and a short stack, but it didn't quell the monsters in my tummy.  So if you want some island style mornings grinds, craving for traditional breakfasts, or just looking for some sweets, this isn't a bad stop.",

    "text": "Nothing like CAKE for breakfast!!  We ordered the Kahluah Pig Benedict and the Chick Skillet with Red Velvet Pancakes. The service was good. The server was prompt and polite, always there to refill coffee. The food came out quick enough, the portions weren't enormous like many breakfast places do. The Benedict was good enough, the pig was tender, cabbage just slightly crunchy. The poached egg was poached hard (Not runny) which I like a little more runny, but that's ok, and I could always go for more hollandaise! haha! As I had seen mentioned in another post, the hashbrowns suck. They're a thin layer of potatoes crisped on the top side, mushy on the bottom. Meh.  The skillet sucked terribly. The \"chick\" aka, chicken, was in the form of 3 small pieces. VERY disappointing! (Mentioned it to the server, and it was taken care of, but besides the point) They did not skimp at all on the benedict, but the skillet was a wash.  The Red Velvet cakes were amazing. But then, who doesn't like eating birthday cake for breakfast? Because seriously, that's what it is. Sugary mess of yum.  And honestly, not impressed. I can nuke some birthday cake in the microwave and call it a day.  All in all, I don't plan on returning, thanks anyways!",

    "text": "Well, let's start off with the location: it is away from the hustle and bustle of the busy Las Vegas Strip and not too far that it's too close to the mountains. I love it!  Next, well, it's a small cozy nook so I expect that parking is minimal.. It's located inside a commercial complex so parking is not bad.. We just had to circle around once to find a suitable parking for our truck.  Being that it is a cozy little nook, of course waiting area is a bit packed when we got in. Cashier is also right there by the door so you have people trying to get out and people trying to get in at the same area.. One plus, there are benches where you can sit while you and your party waits. My only biggest comment would be that, I wish the hostess would smile. She doesn't look happy at all.. All the while, there's a sign that says \"be nice or leave\".. Well, how do you expect people to be nice and friendly when your hostess does not acknowledge the guest at all let alone smile? Even after I said thank you after she sat us at our table.. Still no smile. Don't get me wrong, she wasn't rude or anything.. But just please smile!  Our server on the other hand, Jamie, is very friendly and accommodating. All smiles and cheerful! She made sure my drinker are re-filled all the time.. She's very attentive. Great service! Good job!  Now, my favorite part of the review.. FOOD! Being a chef, this is where I tend to focus on. We ordered the Rick's Adobo Fried Rice wrapped in omelet. That was bomb!!! So tasty and fluffy! Absolutely delicious! As a side for it, I ordered Rocky Road Pancake. That was good too! Our server suggested to get that instead of the s'mores pancake. I'm happy I did! Then, we also ordered the Kahlua Grilled Cheese Sandwich. My fiance said it was really good but if only the portion is bigger for the price they sell it for. And lastly, I ordered Loco Moco. That was amazing! But it wasn't enough rice.. Lol. I had to order an additional side of rice. Now, the macaroni salad that came with it, it was a bit bland. Could use more mayo and salt & pepper. Other than that, food was better than expected.. Service was amazing.  I would absolutely come back at Baby Stacks! Perhaps try the other food choices they have.. And hopefully when I come back, I'll be greeted by a hostess with a big smile on her face!",

I usually go for drinking and gambling, so it was nice that I could wake up before 9 AM to try different food places.  We know pancakes can be filling, but we were determined to try the food. So we ordered 2 different pancakes with eggs and bacon. Suffice to say, my wife and I didn't finish our order.  We ordered the red velvet pancakes (so good) and the pecan pancake (can't remember the name). Very satisfied with the meal. We ordered the Portuguese sausage as well. It's good, but it taste pretty much the same as the ones you can buy from the super market.",

I get the place is your relaxing breakfast dine, but to have your guest sitting for 7 to 10 minutes after being sat and then only taking our drink orders and then bringing it to us five minutes later and then having us flag down our server is irrelevant.   This isn't my first time experiencing this here, but being that I work in the food and beverage industry I always try to give chances because I understand the inside and out... However, that isnt something I should have to get use to. It's annoying especially when you are hungry... the management needs to teach them that.

Cabs can be expensive so we normally spend 95% of our time on the strip.  Now that we have family in Sin City, we are starting to venture out a little bit more, and it's the one of the best Vegas decisions we have ever made.  We were talking with our family about where to go for Sunday Brunch.  We found buffets ranging from $17.95 to $90 per person on the strip.  Then I hopped on the internet and found BabyStacks Cafe.  They have 4 locations in town. We liked the description and headed to the one off of Flamingo blvd on Buffalo Drive.  This restaurant is owned by a woman who dared to ask herself one crazy question:  What would happen if you take cupcake flavors and turn them into pancakes?  The answer, pure AWESOMENESS! We were a party of 4 and waited for about 30 minutes to get our table.  From what I read, this is pretty normal for the restaurant.  The capacity is a little over 50+ people, and the demand is high, so be prepared for a little wait.  Once in the restaurant, we found it to be clean and the service was spot on.  We ordered quickly.  Here is what we decided on:  Red velvet pancakes German chocolate pancakes Lemon Ricotta crepe like pancakes Orange Creamsicle pancakes Bacon pancakes Biscuits and Gravy with sunny side up eggs and hashbrowns Mexican Omelette Egg White Omelette  The menu is full of great sounding cupcake flavored pancakes, as well as traditional favorites.  They even have Hawaiian specialties with pulled pork and spam. If the other dishes are anything close to what we ordered, you can't go wrong.  Every single dish was delicious.  We all shared what we ordered and all any of us could say was, \"WOW!\"  Personally, I thought the red velvet pancakes were the best, but it was so close to call that there really was no clear winner.  I have never raved about breakfast before.  But I just had to write about this place. BabyStacks Cafe is by far the best breakfast I have ever had. Here is the kicker...the total cost for all 4 of us was $70!  We all ate until we were stuffed and every bite was wonderful.  I guarantee that you can't find anything like this on the strip.  I would suggest that if you are on the strip and you don't have a car, Uber, Lyft, or cab-ride it to this restaurant.  You will be happy you did!",

I ordered the Adobo Chicken Omelet, and boy it was amazing! Definitely did not expect that. Load it up with a bunch of Cholula or Tapatio sauce (it's not the same with Sriracha), and I could eat this multiple times a week. The egg was fluffy and the rice and chicken had great flavor, but adding the sauces totally takes it up a notch.   And I couldn't pass up on the famous Red Velvet Pancakes, so I ordered a small stack as well. It was extremely fluffy, and tasted similar to Red Velvet... but not quite there. The cream cheese sauce definitely made this pancake one of the best pancakes ever. It provides a different kind of sweetness, and you don't need too much whereas with pancakes from Ihop, I generally have to smother it in syrup.   I hear there can be a long wait sometimes; I was lucky enough to have gone on a weekday during lunch and waited only for a table to get cleaned up. Even if I had to wait... this place is worth it!",

Everything was so ono (delicious!). The best part... When the bf asked for shoyu, they gave us the best kind, aloha brand. We got seated right away, the service was great, food was amazing. If I were to ever move to Vegas, I would have to come here frequently, it feels like home.",

There were so many good choices my wife and I were not sure what to get but we had a lot of suggestions from family and friends that have been here before. I had the corned beef hash and my wife had the Adobo fried rice we were both happy with our food and it did remind us of our favorite spot back in Hawaii. I will definitely recommend this place to all of my friends and family!",

    "text": "Babystacks is a great place to start off the day - great food and reasonable prices.  Me and the hubby usually get eggs and bacon, which also comes with potatoes (I would recommend the hashbrowns) and toast/english muffin.  They have a kids menu, and for about $6 you get a small pancake, egg any style, potatoes, and a meat (sausage or bacon) - that's a pretty good deal for kids.  The pancakes usually look pretty good - if you like decadent pancakes, they definitely have those here!  I would recommend getting there early though - none of their locations are really big, so if you get there too late, you'll end up waiting.  Oh, and I think they have pretty good coffee too - most restaurants I think have really strong and basic flavored coffee, but I've always thought that they have decent coffee here.",

    "text": "I'll admit it, I hate giving out 5 stars.  I'm just so stingy, I think 5 out of 5 should be  reserved for near perfection.  I had no choice Baby Stacks.  You left me no out.  5 out of 5 it is.    The people have spoken.  And they said they want red velvet pancakes from Baby Stacks Cafe.  So who am I to argue?  For my first trip to this highly recommended breakfast stop, I got the velvet short-stack along with a side of scrambled eggs and a glass of milk.  Very basic.  FOOD:  The short-stack was 3 smaller thick pancakes, which was just right for me to feel full but not disgusted with myself.  I've never had red velvet pancakes, but why haven't I heard of this sooner?!  It's one of the most delicious things on earth.  The perfect sweetness, texture, toppings - man, I just can't do these things justice.  Trust me when I say they are straight from heaven.    SERVICE: The only thing sweeter than my short-stack was my server.  \"Yvette\" I believe was her name, a young Hawaiian-looking girl with the happiest attitude without a hint of fakeness.  She was smiley, quick to greet and take my order, always asking if there was anything else she could do, checking up on me just right.  And my food came out ridiculously quick.  I was pleasantly impressed!  DECOR:  The restaurant is fairly small, but cozy, clean, refreshing, and new in appearance.  You can tell someone took pride in it.  The small bar style seating area was neat.  There was a TV.  Soothing, light, uplifting music.  Very nice colors, plants, decorations, new furniture (tables and booths) and overall just extremely well taken care of.  I honestly can't find a single negative thing to say.  It was such a nice breakfast.  They really earned my stingy 5 star rating!  I wish it was next door to my apartment!",

The last time I went, I got the almond joy pancakes. They were chocolate pancakes with almond shavings, coconut, chocolate syrup, and whipped cream. I thought it was reeeeeally good because the chocolate pancakes weren't TOO chocolately as you would expect, I think it was the perfect amount of chocolately goodness.   Everyone thinks the red velvet pancakes are amazing.. I beg to differ. They are just \"bleh\" to me, nothing special. I think the hype sells them.   My usual is the honey whole wheat pancakes. These pancakes have a different texture from the regular pancakes which I really enjoy and they're supposed to be more healthy.. hence the whole wheat --so it's the one I typically order.   The orange juice taste fresh squeezed.   Expect 30-45 min wait times before being seated because this place is always busy!",

My four friends and I ordered different items and we were all upset and unimpressed because the food wasn't as tasty as it would seem. I got sausage and eggs with red velvet pancakes, and my friends got the breakfast burrito, corned beef with eggs and blueberry pancakes. For me, the sausage and eggs wasn't tasty at all. The quality was really cheap tasting. I can tell what a quality egg tastes like and these were flavorless and the sausage was just salty tasting, no flavor. I could make this same meal at home and it would taste way better. The red velvet pancakes did taste better than I expected, but all-in-all the whole meal was disappointing. It's also expensive for what you pay for.",

    "text": "I have never heard soo many great reviews as I have heard about this place.  When I got a text from my friend last night before that they were going to Babystacks for brunch, I jumped on the moment to tag along.  Boy am I glad I did!  ***Please be advised that you may have to wait a while before you get a table.  The hostess advised me that it could be upwards of up to 45 minutes.  We ended up waiting a little over 30 minutes.  Speaking of the hostess, I would like to share the only reason why this place got 4 stars for me.  This morning, there was a young girl in the front, taking everyone's name for the list.  She was definitely not as pleasant as I hoped for.  Maybe it just wasn't her day.  She showed a lot of irritation and no patience for anyone in front of her.  When it was time to pay, I noticed a jar that said, \"Tip for hostess,\" and realized why there was only a SINGLE dollar in there...  Ok, I'm done with my negative rant.  I want to talk about the AH-MAZE-ING food known as Babystacks!  Here's what me and my friends got:  Spam and Eggs for $8.25- It came with 3 slices of fried spam, eggs the way you like it (I got it scrambled) and either potatoes, hash browns, garlic rice for an extra charge and pancakes (any kinds of specialty pancakes for an up charge as well).  I chose the garlic rice and the bacon pancakes to get a versatile meal.  The rice was regular white rice with some kind of garlic infused oil drizzle over it with onions.  The only suggestion we had was maybe having caramelized onions in the future, but the rice was good.  The eggs were eggs and so was the spam.  Here's where this dish blows your minds...WHEN YOU COMBINED THOSE FLAVORS IN ONE BITE! That combination in one bite just made this dish worth it for me.  The pancakes were buttermilk pancakes with strips of bacon in the batter.  I really love eating breakfast meat with maple syrup so having that bacon in the pancakes made it AMAZEBALLS for me!!  Kalua Pig Benedict for $9.75- Now this is the dish that will keep me coming back!!  Let's start with the most flavorful seasoned potatoes cut into small cubes.  Then my friends, then there's the main attraction!  Toasted English Muffin, layered with a smoked Kalua (shredded) pig with cabbage, a medium poached egg and topped with hollandaise sauce.  I can't tell you how AH-MAZE-ING this dish is.  You'll just have to try it yourself.  Just know that the pork is super juicy and smokey, the English muffin is toasted by still soft, the egg is perfectly poached and the hollandaise is...well, let's just say that I'm going to dream about that sauce for months to come.  My friend had the short stack of Red Velvet Pancakes for $5.75- Start with 3 red velvet pancakes, topped with chocolate chunks and whipped cream and served with a cream cheese syrup.  I had the opportunity to try this and boy was it good!!  Super moist, super flavorful and such a great concept/reality!  I will be ordering a full stack the next time.  My other friend got the Portuguese sausage and eggs for $8.95- He had his eggs over easy, got the hashbrowns and chose the banana cream pie pancakes for an extra charge.  The Portuguese sausage is very familiar to me, being from Hawaii and it looked like the eggs were perfectly cooked.  Although I didn't try his meal, I know he was very satisfied by it, especially the banana cream pie pancakes.  His pancakes had bananas in the batter and as a topping.  These pancakes also came with sliced almonds, whipped cream, crushed pie crust and drizzled with a banana cream sauce.    The place is small.  Super small.  There's a t.v. in the joint, contains bar top seating and a couple of butterflies as it's decor.  I'd consider this place a contender for Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives.  The food is that good!  If it wasn't for the hostess with the bad impression, this place would have gotten a 5 star.  Mark my words though.  The food itself will keep me coming back!",

We were looking forward to the Red velvet pancakes and all the hype about them so we shared a half order of them. Unfortunately they did not live up to all the hype, we were both expecting red velvet pancakes but got pancakes with food coloring we were pretty disappointed. The pancakes were not fluffy goodness but yet a weird texture not to tasty and the \"cream cheese syrup\"  tasted like that frosting you would put on those cinnamon rolls you get at the grocery store.   Now on the flip side I ordered the Huntington omelet which had cheddar cheese, bacon and avocado which came with your choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes i got the \"seasoned potatoes\" which were not seasoned one bit and i also got an english muffin which was good but how can you mess that up. The omelet was pretty tasty how can you go wrong with cheese bacon and avocado , nothing that great but it was good.   Overall it was an ok experience I was pretty disappointed I expected it to be way better because of all the reviews on yelp. I probably wont return here because there are better breakfast places out there.",

    "text": "i'm a bit torn about writing this review, but after reading the recent ones, i feel like i have to chime in, too...  we were visiting vegas from la this week and wanted to eat at some off-the-strip (read: cheap) places. babystacks actually reminded us of cici's cafe and ninong's cafe here at home in that they offer lots of crazy yummy creative pancakes, plus homestyle classic filipino dishes and are small family-owned businesses. unfortunately, the similarities end there.  red velvet pancakes, hazelnut pancakes, and banana cream pie pancakes were all fantastic. we liked how you could get just a short stack of 3 instead of 6 - who can really eat 6 pancakes anyway? the banana cream pie ones, especially - the banana slices in between each pancake plus the banana pudding on top... wow! the chicken adobo fried rice omelette dish was really good, too, and I'd definitely order it again.  now the reason for two stars: the corned beef hash was spoiled. like totally rotten, could smell it before tasting it. whoever cooked it should've been able to tell it was no good. we eat out (for breakfast, especially) all the time and this is the first time we've ever been served spoiled food. EVER. the worst part was that when we told the waitress that the corned beef hash tasted off, she didn't even seem surprised!!! she just asked if we wanted something else. only when she brought the new dish of bacon and eggs did she apologize. it was all quite shocking, actually. or maybe the sugar/carb high had us all foggy and unable to react faster. she did remove the dish from our bill without us having to ask her to - which was cool, but again, she didn't seem too fazed or apologetic about it.  when the hostess (who i'm guessing is the main proprietress?) asked us how everything went as were paying, i didn't have the heart to say anything about the corned beef. i certainly hope the waitress did, though, or at least brought it to the attention of the cook! after she took our plate away, i kept an eye/ear out to see if anyone else ordered it, but no other orders came out.   so, two stars with reservation because the pancakes were so good, but really should be one star for serving spoiled food. thankfully my senses are in overdrive from the pregnancy hormones so that it only took one tiny bite to know the corned beef was bad, which i promptly spit out anyway. future customers, beware! or just stick to the pancakes!!!",

    "text": "Me: I love going out for breakfast. My dear hubby doesn't. He mostly hates the smell and idea of griddle fry. Don't blame him so this weekend, a holiday weekend, he asks, \"Wanna go to breakfast?\" Um, YEAH! So off we go to wait somewhere for breakfast. I chose a no-egg-in-title-ergo-no-griddle-fry, breakfast joint, for this rare occasion. Been to Babystacks a couple years ago before the name change. It was good but mostly crowded, and we were suckered into ordering the red velvet pancakes. As pancakes go, they were good, but honestly, it was a mistake to order because not particularly a fan of red velvet because of the systematic abuse of red food coloring and fake chocolate flavor that occurred as a result of the trend that been red velvet in the last decade, as opposed to the light cocoa flavor it's supposed to have. This time, however, we partook in the Hawaiian-style brekkie (Moco Loco and Portuguese sausage and eggs w rice) as well as a skillet and of course many sides of many non-red velvet pancakes (banana cream pie, cookies and cream, lemon ricotta) plus a Nutella crepe. Suffice it to say, everything was delicious, not greasy, no odor of the dreaded griddle fry, and despite all the food ordered, we all left satisfied and not overly stuffed. There was a wait, but turn-around was efficient and quick as could be. Place was clean and friendly and did we mention no griddle fry? Btw, their red velvet pancakes are, in fact, good if you still like the trend, er...flavor.   Him: The pancakes were soft and delicious. I ordered cookies and cream pancakes. They were so chocolatey. They came with cream and glaze, but I didn't even need the glaze. Also, I loved the skillet. It wasn't a scramble, just over-easy eggs on top, so there were sauteed veggies underneath and they were so good. I couldn't stop eating them. There were potatoes, onion, peppers and mushroom and cheese. There was a wait but it felt like forever (it actually was about 20 mins after told 30). That is how good the place is: everyone wants to eat there so we had to wait forever. It was worth the wait. I would wait again millions more times for their pancakes and veggies.",

But after coming here a few times and not being satisfied with their serving portions on the pricier meals i have to rate it mainly on that. If im going to pay $12 for a meal then a $1 upgrade garlic fee then i expect to get a little more than a half cup of rice with my meal. Its seriously like 4 bites and my rice is gone. But i guess i can pay another $3 for another 4 bites of rice...?  The flavors are amazing. I have had the corned beef hash, the country fried steak, the Adobo fried rice and an omelette. All very tasty. The pancakes are ok. They are not light and fluffy as i would like them but if u pile a bunch of their toppings on them theyre not that bad. The cashier was rude and server was nice. I dont know if i will return again...maybeeeee one last try....",

Sometimes when you get red velvet food it doesn't taste like red velvet...Its not just chocolate dyed red people!  These were on point.  We also got the piglet omelet, huntington omelet, smores pancakes, banana cream pie pancakes and the kids scramble.  Everyone enjoyed their food.  We went on a Friday morning and there was no wait.  Service wasn't the greatest.  Our waitress was very nice just not very attentive.  Drinks were never refilled, not once, needed a min to look at the menu didn't come back for over 15 min while others were seated, got drinks and ordered.  Still she didn't come back.  They weren't busy so it was a little surprising.  My tip: don't say you need a minute.  Took quite awhile to get the check.  The busser had cleared our table and we still sat waiting for the check.  Kinda hard when you have little ones who are ready to go.   Overall, the food was worth the service issues.  Looking forward to trying the carrot cake pancakes next time.",

They definitely get slammed on the weekends, which is to be expected, so sometimes you feel rushed by the servers to turn your table as fast as possible.    The decor is quaint and perfect for the establishment and it is a pretty small restaurant overall.  The menu has a decent selection and something for everybody.",

It's pretty normal.  They had pancakes, and omelettes and other normal breakfast item.  I ordered the eggs and sausage that came with pancakes and seasoned potatoes or other items.  I paid $1.50 upcharge for the specialty pancakes.  What's the point of going to Babystacks to get regular pancakes.  I ordered the s'mores which were really good.  They have white chocolate chips, marshmallows and little bits of graham cracker shavings.  I usually like to have toast with my eggs because I like to dip my bread in the yolk.    All in all, it was normal for breakfast.",

The interior is fairly large -- much larger than the first location, I'm told -- with several large TVs scattered around the room. For single diners, there's a bar to sit at.  The red velvet pancakes that everyone talks about is as good as advertised. Rich, chocolatey, cakey, but not too dense or sweet to make you think you're eating dessert at 8 in the morning. Apparently, it's a home-made recipe not a prepackaged mix. Topped with whipped cream, chocolate shavings, and cream cheese syrup, it's one of the better breakfast items I've had.  As much as I'd like to order it again, there are so many other delicious sounding items on the menu to try. With this place just minutes from my house, I'm sure I'll have the opportunity to make my way through all of them.",

The sign was simply to inform customers that they will not split checks.  So if you want to split the check, get over it. They do one check per table. Also they only seat you if your entire party has arrived. This didn't apply to us since we were paying and arriving together.  We were seated immediately by a very kind waitress. The menu has a good variety and their pancakes are so good. A short stack (3 pancakes) can easily fill you up for less than $5. We decided on the Bananas Foster and Red Velvet with sides of sausage and hash browns. The food was served very quickly. It was fantastic and surprising.  I highly recommend their pancakes and hash browns. They are the best I've tried in the Vegas area.  We ate at a relaxing pace and there was attentive service. When we asked for our check, it was ready immediately and we paid at the cashier. They cleaned our table before we were out the door and had it ready to seat new customers. I think we were out of there by 9:20.  If you are looking for a quick, delicious meal at a great price with excellent service, then this is the place! Thank you BabyStacks!",

Sent him to pickup for me since I had the flu, and they even didn't have an order - my food ticket was \"missing\"?   They eventually found it, and it took much longer since there was a big order ahead of me now (no longer the 10-15 min wait time, and he even arrived in 25 mins since it's consistently never ready when promised!)   Also, if you use a cc - expect them to ask for your tip at ring out on take out orders... it's really awkward, and horribly worse when you get home and it's the wrong order!   By the time he got home (now 1 hr later), I found out it one of the two orders had the wrong meat...If you call in a takeout order, have them repeat it back to you & check it at the counter...because when I called them, they argued with me that I ordered it wrong. I have never in my life eaten turkey sausage (which apparently are scary dry patties).   After I said there's literally no way I ordered something I've never heard of, they did replace it, but I drove to get it since he was already really pissed off from the first pick up delay and the nerve of them to ask for a tip when they lost the ticket and he got stuck waiting around 30+ mins.    I wouldn't have even written this if they lost the ticket but we're sorry about it and made some sort of effort to try to get it out asap...but the expected tip and the wrong food is just too much to ignore.",

My boyfriend's cousin spoke very highly of this place, so we had to give this place a try, especially since he told us that some of the dishes are Filipino inspired.  Since there were a lot of us, we all tried to order something different so we could try each other's food if we wanted. The food here is AMAZING!!! The red velvet pancakes are a piece of heaven on a plate and the Portuguese sausages are delightful as well. They also have delicious garlic fried rice, which is basically a comfort food if you are Filipino. It honestly gave me my rice fix since I was having withdrawals on this trip. For bacon lovers, like my boyfriend, there are bacon pancakes that are mouthwatering. My sister's fiancee had Rick's Adobo Rice dish, which was very delicious and was large enough for two people. All of the dishes are reasonably priced and they do give you good portion sizes here.  The service that we had was on point as well. Our waitress was very attentive to our needs and refilled our drinks when she saw that we were running low. A+ in my book  Overall, this place will not disappoint! There are a wide variety of pancake combinations and the other items on the menu are also a wonderful treat. I'm looking forward to dining at this place again in the near future.",

The pancakes were perfectly cooked. I also chose the \"Bacon & Eggs\" under the Breakfast Favorites section. Came with exactly what it says (3 huge bacon strips, eggs cooked any way u want) plus your choice of side (crispy potatoes FTW) [$9] I upgraded to the special pancakes so no toast (extra charge). Mmm everything tasted excellent and was very filling. I tried a bit of the \"Orange Creamsicle,\" tasted like ice cream!   The wait was less than 15 min on a Sat afternoon (1-2pm) at this location. Our waitress was so nice and respectable.. I want to come back and try their other pancake options as well as their other menu items.",

    "text": "The reason for 4 stars is because I believe this location is too small to house that many people. You notice this as soon as you walk through the door, there was an inadequate area where people were supposed to sit and wait for tables but that section gets overrun with people within 5 minutes. They should have a designated host/hostess to seat guests. The second reason for only 4 stars is because we knew our server was busy but he didn't refill our drinks the entire time we were sitting there and he didn't great our table for approximately 7-10 minutes. It was busy and I understand that things get lost but I believe management should hire more servers for this venue.   Let's get on to the food!  The food is great! I ordered spam and eggs and everything was cooked to my liking. I ordered a side of hazelnut pancakes! Those were also excellent. Family of 4 was happy aside from the drink part. But the food is really very good! Just a few fixes in hiring and this place would deserve 5 stars.",

Strawberry shortstack was just a shortstack with strawberries and whipped cream. Plain and expected but it was still delicious. (But you can kinda get something like this somewhere else) Mocha chip pancakes felt like it was a bit too much for me. Just really sweet and really heavy. Didnt like it. But I wanted to give 4 star rating because of their friendly service. My coffee was always filled by our observant server. Thanks. Overall, decent food and great service.

It's uncomfortable to say the least- hoping we'll be able to enjoy the food.   We asked if the AC is broken and were told it's just how it is here in the summer. Apparently employees have told management repeatedly but to no avail.   I'm hoping to be able to revisit and give more stars next time.

    "text": "I cannot convey in words just how delicious these damn pancakes are.  My boyfriend is not a pancake person.  He doesn't enjoy food like I do, and pancakes are pretty much at the bottom of his breakfast/brunch list. He always finishes these pancakes.    This breakfast place works great for a California- Hawaii couple like us.  They have an awesome selection of Hawaii \"comfort foods\" like corned beef hash, Portuguese sausage, eggs, and rice, loco moco, etc.  But, they also have awesome Southwest/Cali/Mex breakfast foods like huevos rancheros.  Favorites: - Red Velvet pancakes are a MUST try.  They're light, delicately chocolately, and covered with REAL whipped cream- which really makes the dish superb. Pancakes are a normal size, not hujangez like Hash House a Go Go, and are slightly crispy on the outside, and warm and spongy on the inside.  - Bananas Foster pancakes:  YES... quite decadent for breakfast, but definitely worth the calories... no wait... I don't want to know how many calories there are in this... Again, the whipped cream really ties the dish together... along with fresh bananas foster.... warm and caramelly. Next time, we'll try the French toast.  - Adobo Fried Rice:  My favorite [non pancake] item on the menu so far.  Pork adobo is cooked to perfection, and combines well with the rice in a savory- slightly tangy (from adobo vinegar).  Next time, I may ask for the rice with the egg done over easy.  I enjoyed the fried egg wrap, but I think it may taste better with an egg yolk cracked over the rice.  - Kalua Pig Benedict:  Awesome... although, I've done this myself at home with some leftover kalua pig, English muffins, and eggs.  Their hollandaise sauce was definitely better, though.  - Loco Moco with garlic fried rice:  Pretty typical.  I would recommend adding the garlic fried rice for an extra kick, though.  Traditional brown gravy, and well prepared hamburger patty made it feel like home.  Gravy was a bit saltier than usual though.  *TIP: Go on a weekday if you can.  Weekends are just nuts.  The boyfriend and I both work from home, so we've been going on Tuesday or Wednesday mornings and usually have no wait for a table.",

Never again will I make this sort of mistake. I still can't get over how good food is off the strip!   We came during the breakfast/brunch rush and were seated at the counter. I was surprised that the restaurant was so full. It seems like a hit with the locals. I'm not sure if it was the business of the restaurant, but we had to wait longer than usual for even our waiter to take our order. After ordering though, he was pretty attentive so I can't really complain.   Now, I'm a HUGE breakfast and brunch fan! Their extensive menu is mostly geared towards breakfast food, with just one page dedicated to their lunch menu. At first I thought it was just your regular American type of Breakfast and Brunch place, but they also have Hawaiian plates such as Loco Moco and Spam Scramble. Apparently they're known for their pancakes, or \"BabyStacks\". There was such a huge variety that I felt pretty overwhelmed. I wanted to try everything! Thanks to Yelp, I just had to order the Red Velvet short stack. Seriously, this was pretty much a dessert party in my mouth! Probably one of the best Red Velvet pancakes I've had. The pancakes had whipped cream, chocolate crumbles, and this amazing cream cheese syrup. It was amazing! We also ordered the Adobo Fried Rice, which is adobo fried rice that's stuffed into an egg omelette. The rice had so much flavor and adding sriracha really brought out the flavor of the dish altogether.   Overall the food met my expectations and I can't wait to come back during our next trip and try the other food! Gracias! Salamat! Mahalo!",

    "text": "we had a party of 10 but 2 of them were meeting up with us there. The wait for that size group on that Sunday morning was 30 minutes. since it was plenty of time for our 2 stragglers to show up before then we put in our name for a table, but those 2 were running a little late. We were brought in and seated and the man hosting who sat us at a table kept asking where the rest of our party was, we insisted they would be arriving shortly. But he kept nagging us about them and spoke to is VERY rudely and with bad attitude and a facial expression to match said to us \"You better not get me in trouble\" and he walked away. Ewe, he disgusted me and his behavior made me lose my appetite. Even my sister said she'd be happy to walk out of he was going to be a dick about it & Baby Stack's Cafe would lose out on good business and since it was our first time we could have been potential regulars. Instead we called the pair and asked them not to show up because the. Man hosting couldn't wait another 5 minutes before acting like an asshole towards us.   Our sever (I wish I heard her name) was super sweet. She was so nice with such a pleasant attitude and very accommodating.    The food was yummy, good enough to redeem the poor behavior we had endured from the douche of a host, but still I wish we didn't have to encounter that man before trying to enjoy a nice Sunday breakfast with my family and our blessing babies and toddlers.   I ordered the honey French toast but it didn't come with anything g other than the two slices of toast so I had to order a side of breakfast potatoes. The French toast was great, I appreciate non-soggy toast since I'm extremely picky of food textures. I also decided I wanted to try the sweet cream crepe and it wasn't anything special, still tasty, but maybe if I had order extra topping for an extra charge I might had been more impressed.   A couple people in our party tried the red velvet pancakes and swear it was the most delicious pancakes they have ever tried, it was so good they had a hard time trying to explain to me just how great it was, all they could say was \"it was amazing\".",

I arrived with my daughter and said we had 5 altogether. They said I had to wait til all were there at first and I was fine with that. My sister and her boyfriend arrived 5 mins later and I said we were ready. The waitress replied \"So theres only 4 people now?\" I said no my brother is parking. Instead of seating us she said they could not seat us until ALL were there. Today is THANKS GIVING and the restaurant was half empty with NO LINE. Being in an industry that deals mainly with customer service I understand their are certain policies all companies have but there is COMMON SENSE when to bend the rules.   For being a smaller cafe they sure can't afford to deny business especially for only being a local spot. They have 2 signs which were pretty negative from the get.  1. Be nice or leave 2. We can't sit incomplete parties. (Which is understandable is they were BUSY)  Both signs just deny business. Morons!!!!",

Went with a large party, as a group we ordered nearly half the items on the menu, and then I stuffed my mouth with (stole) off every single plate that hit the table-- it was all amazing. I had the portuguese sausage and eggs with a short stack of red velvet pancakes (I could drink the CREAM CHEESE SYRUP by itself).   Pros: HUGE variety, so many creative pancake choices (red velvet, carrot cake, white choc macadamia nut, rockry road), clean environment, trendy (yet unassuming) atmosphere, friendly and attentive staff, reasonable prices.  Cons: They don't have a location in Southern California.",

    "text": "So my mom and I were looking for a great, inexpensive brunch spot on our way out of town. We read all these reviews on yelp about the pancakes. So we chose this place. It was also my mom's birthday... I love everything red velvet and had to have the pancakes, however the Cinnabon ones were also ones we wanted to try. So we got short stacks of both. In addition we split the Spinach and Bacon Eggs Benedict. The Benedict came with a choice of hash browns or seasoned potatoes. I am pretty sure that most of the food is typical Sysco food, I'm not even sure the hollandaise is freshly made. With that said however, the Benedict was delicious. I ate one potato and pushed them aside, should have ordered the hash browns. We did have a ton of food though so it wasn't like I was starving for more food.  Now to the pancakes. I made the mistake of not telling our server to put everything on the side as they put so much whipped cream(fresh homemade) and powdered sugar and some chocolate dust. I removed all the toppings and went for the bottom one. I liked the pancake, it was cooked perfectly, super fluffy and warm. I was not so thrilled with the \"icing\" it needed more of a cream cheese flavor because it settled at the bottom. I liked it but I didn't love it. I had a bite of the Cinnabon pancake, although too sweet for me I liked it better. It didn't need any syrup because it had the icing already on it and the pecans made it crunchy and perfect. Again it was a perfectly cooked pancake.  My mom would give this place 4... And a 5 just for the pancakes. I can't. Looking around at the egg dishes, they looked so generic and again, like Sysco food products.  I'd say if you want fantastic pancakes go there, but if you want eggs then pass.",

    "text": "This place reminds me of Ken's pancake house back in Hawaii, with many pancake choices and Hawaiian food here and there. This new location has a shorter wait than the original store on weekends and it's much roomier so I prefer this store.   I was the one who wanted to go here, but my friend who has a sweet tooth started getting more excited than me as he perused the menu. No surprise since the pancakes sound more like desserts than breakfast food. We ordered a few to try - red velvet tastes like dessert with marshmallow whipped cream and cream cheese syrup, while white chocolate and the others taste just like normal pancakes with fancy toppings. Also, the kalua pig benedict didn't taste like normal kalua pig so I wouldn't recommend it.   Stick with the red velvet pancake here. Expect it to taste like dessert. And a short stack is more than enough for two people, trust me.",

Well my order was placed and told that I can pick them up within 20 minutes. Well i always give an extra 5-10 minutes when i place \"to-go\" orders just because not all the time are these orders ready. Well keep in mind this was my first time choosing to eat here and when i arrived the place was PACKED, but this is expected on a Sunday right? Anyways i paid for my order to only find out that my order was STILL not ready after me arriving 35 minutes later. Well the girl working the front registar went and checked on my order and said they were still working on my order. No problem. Well after about 10 more minutes she checks again and brings out 2 boxes of somebody else's order. Pretty annoying now at this point i've been waiting 45 minutes for what was suppose to be a 20 minute wait. She apologized and said my order would be right out. Well 15 minutes later my actual order came out and at this point i was basically over this whole pancake experience. They gave me a $10 gif certificate for the wait time. Nice gesture.. i guess.. The pancakes are Okay... Red velvet's were the best and the banana cream pie ones i could have made myself.. Not sure if I'll return.",

The pork adobo fried rice is also really good.  It's wrapped inside a scrambled egg.  The flavor of it is perfect.    I also got the scrambed spam one time; and it's just okay.  I don't think I would get it again; probably just stick to my favorites.    I just wished the restaurant was bigger.  Because sometimes we have to make sure we get there early enough to beat the morning people planning to have a LONG breakfast.  Staff is really friendly also (oh, and I have probably mentioned this before in my other reviews; where we have noticed that when a restaurant is not busy it seems like you get bad service.  Bad meaning...slower?!  People hanging out at the back or by the bar.  Well, we had this incident once at BabyStacks since we went early.  My husband was waiting for a refill on his coffee and did not get it until 15 minutes later.  Weird, how that works; seems like a place has to be jam packed for people to keep moving).

We were a group of 4 and we ordered a variety of dishes  - bacon, scrambled eggs, fried eggs, Portuguese sausage, and pancakes.  I had the banana cream pie pancakes and they really tasted like banana cream pie.  If you like banana cream pie, you will love these pancakes.  My friends had carrot cake, cinnabun and bacon pancakes.  They were all well received but the bacon pancakes had a complaint that they were lacking a bit in the bacon department.   I didn't not try them, but they did not look like they were super infused with bacon as they should be.  The only major complaint we had was service.  When we first arrived we asked if they had fresh brewed iced tea and the woman taking our drink order said no.  We saw a pitcher of what looked like iced tea sitting on the counter top.  We asked our waiter when he came to take our order and he said that was indeed iced tea.  Apparently the woman who took our order did not speak english very well.  Hmm...that's a bit problematic.  We also had to ask twice to get coffee refills.  Other than those small flaws, everything was delicious and we left stuffed and happy.",
