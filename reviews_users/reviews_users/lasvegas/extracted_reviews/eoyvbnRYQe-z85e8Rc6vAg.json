Jeff even went out of his way to check on some info for me about a city I was interested in going to in the future. We had already ate, so had a few drinks....excellent. From what I saw the pizzas look good, have a few more days in Vegas, hope to try one.",

But what really got me was their wine special...was really wanting a very good glass of wine on this last night of our adventure.   Never did get their pizza, although I seen it pass by a few times...Ordered their lemon Veal, and it was simply amazing. could cut through it with your fork. The waitstaff here was spot on, and the atmosphere and decor of the restaurant was beautiful...felt like you were in a little eatery in Italy. The prices are right...you get a good size portion - didn't order any appetizer...although they did bring out this very fresh, warm bread...which hit the spot! Was so hungry!   the wine was brought out in a little glass canister, and was enough for two glasses.  Really enjoyed my dinning experience here, and I ate alone. Just sat back, relaxed and people watched.",

In the fifteen minutes that he was gone, not a single person came to check on us or clear our plates.  The bread was good and that's it. UGH!! I ordered the lasgna and honestly it ididn't even look, smell, or taste like real meat.  I sweat it looked like some kinda of mystery meat and it smelled terrible after i scooped it off the layers and set it to the side.  I felt sick after eating and all I had was the layers of noodles and the cheese.  My friend had some kind of pasta and said it was too sweet.  Poor service. Terrible food.  Overpriced.  I will not be going back. Stay away. Try Trevi at Caesars--way better!",

This is located inside the Golden Nugget in Downtown Las Vegas. it was a set dinner course I had the breaded chicken with penne (can't remember the name) w/ a Caesar salad and dessert Strawberry cheesecake. Service was excellent here we had 4 people catering to us and all four of them were outstanding my other Aunt and I were the special ones at the table cause on my meal i didn't want mushrooms and artichokes mixed with the sauce on my chicken so the guy put the special order for me and my Aunt didn't want the Strawberry cheesecake or the chocolate cake that we had to choose from so the guy brought her ice cream instead. Another thing was i dropped one of my med pills it was a very small white round pill so as i looking under the table for it with flashlight and all the girl waitress came over got on all floors to look for it way beyond the call of duty we couldn't find it luckily i had extra. She was a trooper going underneth the table and all. I would definitely come back here to eat again. Overall great food and great to see family that came from Ohio, Texas, and Hawaii. Sorry no pics i chowed down my food so fast lol.",

I went to the bar and asked about happy hour and the bartender said I had to wait a few minutes.  So I decided to wait.  He did not however say anything about having to eat in restaurant.  After waiting, I went back and tried to get a pizza to go.  I got the receipt and the pizza was $18 - full price.  I asked about the happy hour menu and was told I had to eat there.  I was not in the mood to argue or sit there so I just took paid and waited for the pizza.  All I got was a plain pepperoni pizza.  It was pretty good.  A little salty and the sauce made the crust a little soggy because it was pretty thin.  Not really worth $18, but I guess that's what I get after gambling all day and forgetting to eat dinner.",

We walked around and decided to eat at the Golden Nugget because that is what we were closest to. The Golden Nugget has a 9 different restaurants inside and Grotto happens to be among them.  My boyfriend and I were sat immediately. Our waiter was very punctual. He got our drinks quickly. He gave us enough time to look over the menu. We received fresh bread with an olive oil blend, which I loved.  My boyfriend ordered their 4th of July drink special. It was a margarita that was red, white, and blue. It was $7.99; there was quite a bit of alcohol in it, and the price wasn't bad. For our entrees, my boyfriend ordered the Meatzza and I ordered the cannelloni. The cannelloni looks somewhat like a pasta burrito. They use a homemade pasta shell that's flat like a tortilla but fluffier and airier, then the pasta shell is rolled with chicken and spinach in it with bechamel (white sauce) and marinara (red sauce) on top. The Meatzza is their signature pizza that is topped with pepperoni, homemade meatballs, Italian sausage, and pancetta. It was good, but I thought my cannelloni was better. :)  Our server was probably one of the best servers we have had. He was on top of it and his accent made us feel like we were in Italy. We just wish we could remember his name so everyone on Yelp could ask for him if given the chance to eat here.",

My husband has never been a fan of Italian food, but after eating the lasagna here, he's found his new favorite of all time. The prices are modest when you consider the quality of the food here is on par with any high end Italian restaurant you'd find in major cities like NYC or Chicago or even anywhere in Italy. I highly recommend Grotto to anybody who appreciates truly delicious food.",

    "text": "Hubby and I stopped in here last night for a simple dinner. We don't do the fancy steak houses when in Vegas. Grotto seemed \"ok\" at first. Not at all crowded (the Rams game was playing) most people were in bars elsewhere. We asked the Hostess (dark hair, about 25) what she'd order and she described a few entrees as if she were a chef. How they were prepared, etc. We KNEW we'd found the place for us. Mouths watering we told her, \"Yeah, yeah we'd like a table, please.\" Our water and bread came quickly with a nice garlicky olive oil. I knew what I wanted thanks to the Hostess, but the hubby wanted to know if they could do a simple pasta not on the menu. He asked our server, a woman about 50, short light hair, and she immediately knew the pasta dish (aglio olio), suggested a pasta shape to go with it and the hubby was IMPRESSED! We decided to grab the stuffed mushrooms as well and I'll never eat another stuffed mushroom again without comparing them to these. Seriously, if you're ever in Vegas, do yourself the immense honor of going to Grotto in The Golden Nugget, get the mushrooms. Before they're delivered, get ready. Cleanse your palate. No seriously fruity drinks or breath mints (dear God, no!) and realize that your \"stuffed mushroom life\" will change forever. We went on January 12, I hope all that worked that night get a special thank you from us. We recognize that to put together a meal like this takes a team. Hats off to all of you!",

Italian is not a cuisine we usually have much luck with since pretty much everything has onion. We asked the waitress, a very lovely woman I cannot remember her name, what didn't have onion to narrow down the sizeable menu. She went to the kitchen to check with the chef whom came to our table to speak with us. Not surprisingly Chef Paul (I believe was his name. Many cocktails were had that night lol) informed us essentially all dishes were made with onion and since it's in the sauces there wasn't an option to make them without. BUT if there was anything she wanted even if it was off menu to let the waitress know and he would oblige. My mom ordered a Shrimp Scampi with Linguini and she could not stop praising the flavor! She was especially grateful for the understanding.  As for the rest of us, we all thoroughly enjoyed our meals and the desserts were phenomenal.",

Other empty glasses from wine and soft drinks were never picked up. Not even after the bill arrived. The empties just sat there.  Our server was loud and sorta cocky. Which actually can be an asset in some cases. But this guy couldn't pull it off...and, based on our experience with him, he had no justifiable reason to be so self-confident in his style.  Food, though slow to arrive, was pretty good on the whole.  Half of the table enjoyed salads and they were quite flavorful, particularly the mixed greens with beets, pears, and pomegranate dressing. Very nice.  The cannelloni was out of this world good. The portion was only two noodles. I could've eaten a thousand. Fantastic!  The least successful entree at the table was a pizza, which had a droopy, limp crust, sparse toppings and little cheese. If  you go--and that should be a BIG \"if\" in my estimation--take a pass on the menu's pizza section.  After such good food, I was ready to forgive the lackluster service. But that's when Mr. Cocky Server came back and took our final drink orders: a couple of wines, a coffee, and a refill of Coke. \"Got it,\" he said, \"two Merlot, a coffee, and a snort of coke.\" WHAT? Who says that? I wanted to kick him in the nuts for fucking up a perfectly good meal with friends.  The good food is not worth the awful service in my book. I'd rather go to an Olive Garden. At least the server there wouldn't cap off the evening with narcotics jokes.",

Their bottles of wine are cheaper here compared to other Vegas restaurants. Cakebread was $84 instead of the usual $100. I didn't really compare prices on the rest of the bottles.   I got the ravioli alla vodka, which was $16.99. For how much I got it seemed a bit high in price to me. However, my husband got a fettuccine dish that was huge and only cost a dollar more. So, I guess the value varies depending on your dish. Both dishes, however, we're delicious.   Our waitress was very nice and checked on us regulalrly. She was also knowledgeable about the menu (which is quite extensive).",

We had one drunk person in our group who was having a lot of trouble ordering (and comprehending anything). Our server handled it amazingly. He pointed out something he recommended so we ordered it for her. When he brought it, he let us know he would bring something else if she didn't like it. Luckily she LOVED it! The bread and dipping sauce was amazing. I had the spaghetti Bolognese and it was just okay.   The only time the service was noticeably slow was when we were waiting for our checks. The restaurant seemed to also get busier (around 8pm).   There was a walkway splitting the restaurant, so you do get some sketchy people walking by. But we didn't have any problems.",

Our waiter came to our table within minutes of sitting down, explaining the daily special and taking our drink orders. The busboy brought the bread almost immediately. It was delicious. It came with olive oil. He also brought a flavored butter that was excellent. I was disappointed that the restaurant only had two beers on tap. However I was able to order their Sin City Amber. It was excellent. We started with their Italian chopped salad. It was just ok. We had it with their bleu cheese dressing. The bleu cheese dressing was just tasteless. For the main course, we had the chicken cacciatore. This was also fairly devoid of flavor. There was a small amount of vegetables that came with it. Again, almost without flavor. Overall, five star service brought down to a three star rating because of the quality of the food. I don't think I will be back.

Every dish that you try explodes with flavor and freshness. I have been eating here for over 10 years and it is consistently 5 stars every time.  The grotto is not a good restaurant for downtown; it is easily one of the very best restaurants in all of Las Vegas.  They blow away most restaurants that are more than double the price.

Hard to find staff to assist, direct or seat people even with 3 behind the bar, so i checked with the hostess in back dining area.  She directed me where to sit (Happy hour specials only good at the bar.)  Pizza was large, enough for two as entree, or three if having other foods.  Sadly, my pepperoni pizza was full of olive oil and grease.  Service was lacking, I had to go grab bar drink napkins to soak up the oil/grease mess and had to wait for drink refills.  Note I wasn't drinking their happy hour specials, I had a soda with my meal.  Again waited for my bill to come, my server just seemed to disappear!  Asked for my bill after 12 minute wait (I timed it) and a gentleman who appeared to be the manager asked how I enjoyed my pizza.  I showed him the standing grease/oil on my pizza tray and the 5 or 6 bar napkins that were saturated.  He comped my pizza for which I was very appreciative, as I wasn't going to be there to give it another shot a different day.  Server indicated they do put olive oil on the crust to help brown it, but mine appeared to have more than a 'touch' on it.    Give this place a try.  Nicely priced happy hour specials and flavorful food but don't expect to be wowed with service.",

I NEVER would have considered eating at the Golden Nugget. c'mon its reputation (to me) was an old dumpy casino in old dumpy downtown Vegas, but a co -worker recommended it so we gave it a try.   We sat at the bar, ordered a nice chardonnay and were happy to find out it was \"happy hour\".  for 7 bucks we had the most delicious  \"Roasted herbed chicken and garlic, mozzarella, basil, caramelized onions, roasted tomatoes and goat cheese\" pizza!!!  DELICIOUS.  I DEFINITELY WILL go back to GROTTOS!!",

We were received by a friendly hostess and seated a nice table overlooking the pool area (night-time).  Mark our waiter was very friendly, funny, and helpful.  He answered any questions about the menu and was particularly helpful with the wine list, noting several affordable options available from a recent event, not on the list.  Service was great throughout the meal and the food was very good.  We mostly had pasta dishes, which were all delicious. I'd definitely recommend it and will go back next time I'm staying downtown.",

    "text": "I rarely hit up the Nugget, but not blind to the fact that it's probably the best hotel casino north of the strip.  My visit with a homie was due to a small wedding reception dinner at a nearby chapel.  Can you say elope?  Congrats to the love birds Moses and Bree!  Unfortunately, we missed the wedding reception by more than an hour, but made it for the dinner...you could say that we was behaving like we was really related to the bride and groom, lol.  So I played the role of that uncle that just comes through something on everything, and when everything is all \"ate\" and done, it's deuces! J/k...   At first glance, I thought this was just your average casino diner filed with transient d-bags, bit not at all the case.  A look at the menu, and a brief Yelp review, quickly changed my mind.  The use of space is efficient and doors a good job with separating the restaurant from the casino floor.  A view of the pool and shark tank was a pleasant surprise as well.    My buddy and I opted to split the chicken herb pizza since it was a small informal dinner with the bride and grooms closest associates.  There is also a full bar and local brewery beer selection.  That alone can make this man happy.  The pizza was astounding, anything with goat cheese is a major plus for me, bit the overall pizza was scrumptious nonetheless.  Although, our late arrival prevented me from peeping out everyone else's offers.  I love marveling over others' orders to plan my next attack, lol.  I did see some oversized meatballs and pasta specialties, enough to know there are some good stuff on the menu.  A return trip is in order the next time I'm downtown.  I would have to give this experience an overall 3.5, making it a 4-star review.  The pizza was superb and the drinks were flowing with attentive service.  Exceeding my expectations definitely played a part in the rating.  Mazal Tov!",

The chicken was moist and cooked beautifully, just not blackened enough for my liking.  Overall the service was prompt and responsive.  For an appetizer, an entree, and 2 waters of this caliber I would expect to pay between $15 and $18.  Our bill was $28.    Again, I say you are paying for the service and location, not the quality of food.",

She answered all my questions - and was very clear about how much things would cost. We reserved an area of the restaurant that is near the pool that is their Atrium. Although we had to \"buy out\" the space - it was worth the money.   On the day of the dinner, the service was amazing! We had a pretty large party consisting of 40 people - the waiters were on top of refills and getting the food to everyone at the same time. My guests also really loved the food (I did too)!  We paid extra to have a wedding cake and did it through the Golden Nugget's bakery. It was so delicious! We ordered the carrot cake and honestly it is one of the best carrot cakes I have ever tried.   The Sales Manager Jennifer was amazing! She even offered to meet me in person the day before so that if I had any more questions I could ask her in person and so that my husband and I can see what the Atrium looked like the day before.   As a side note - they also allowed us to bring out own centerpieces so it could feel more like a real wedding reception!   I really appreciated how accommodating the Grotto was to my needs for my special day! I highly recommend this place for a wedding dinner or large party because of the amazing service and delicious food.",

The cocktails were just as good.  They have lots of fruity martinis which is my thing.  They put a bar munchies menu out at HH that seems to be regular pricing.  Portions are huge.  We were expecting smaller plates but they were full size (goes with pricing).  From the bar munchies menu we ordered Bruschetta, Bacon Mac & Cheese Bites, Spicy Chicken Sliders and Gorgonzola Fries.  Food was good but a little overpriced.  I would prefer smaller portions for HH.  It wasn't too busy on a weekday afternoon.  Our bartender was friendly and kept the drinks coming.  Works for me.",

The bread was delicious, but that's where it ends. The chicken piccata was dry, tasteless, petrified pieces of chicken. The caprese salad had green tomatoes and no balsamic vinegar.

My boyfriend found the Grotto online and we saw it had great reviews, so why not give it a try?  We had reservations at 5. We got there and the hostess told us that she could seat us but if we wanted to sit at a table in the bar area, drinks pizza and other apps were on happy hour so we gave it a try.  Turns out, we took the gamble and it paid off. Mike was our waiter and second to none. He was the only server In our area and took exceptional care of us. I think a lot of people forget that servers are people too and they aren't your servants (like other tables we're treating him), so we grabbed his attention, got to know him and I could not have asked for a better server.   Mike was personable, kept the drinks flowing until happy hour was over and provided amazing service. The food was delicious (one of the best pizzas in Vegas) and drinks were on point.   When I come back, I will most definitely visit the Grotto again. Great food, great drinks, and great people. It's in the middle of the golden nugget, so it's convenient and has a great ambience. Stop by and check it out - and remember, don't be rude to your server. They are people too and deal with a bunch of rude people, so don't be one. Ask for mike!",

We made her feel good and tried it out. My daughter and yelp were dead on. Great food, great service and a spectacular view of the pool & shark tank aquarium. We highly recommend Grotto. I would have given it 5 stars but it's  in downtown Vegas inside the Golden Nugget off Freemont St.",

    "text": "Let me start this review off by bragging on the bread. Holy shizballs, the fresh baked bread with the basil and garlic infused olive oil was the bomb. I could have eaten that all day. I wish the other food was on this same level.  So, my first experience with the Grotto was ordering Chicken and Goat Cheese Pizza. The crust was just okay, but I loved the sauce and the goat cheese. The chicken unfortunately tasted boiled versus grilled so it gave a weird one note texture experience and almost blandness. I think I would have enjoyed the pizza as a vegetarian option better. Also, the price I paid for it made me shake my head. Vegas is overly expensive for no reason.   On day two, I was really wanting brunch and their brunch options caught my eye. I HAD to have the Ossobuco Hash. It sounded way amazing. So I ordered and I think it confused the waiter that I wasn't drinking. Look, the prices I've ran into have turned me almost tea totaller. Plus, watching drunk douchebags over the past 24 hours have turned me off.   So I order my food and I'm just people watching while trying to figure out if I can eat my food without choking on the fumes of cigarette smoke- because obviously it's 1995 vs 2015, and my food comes out, I look down and I'm immediately disappointed. I don't see any of the rich colors associated with Ossobuco. It just looks like shredded, boiled beef. Also, I was failing to see the hash part. But the biggest sin were the two petrified volley balls sitting on that plate masquerading as poached eggs. No cook with pride would serve that. No line runner worth their salt would approve that. No waiter paying close attention would let that mess make it to me. They were boiled eggs. For the amount of time I waited (and I'm an easy, easy going person to wait on) and knowing how many hands had to touch that plate, I was kinda livid. Well, more insulted. Not all of us are so drunk that everything looks awesome. I had to track down my waiter and tell him what was wrong and it's like he knew! I'm like WTF, if you knew the eggs weren't poached correctly, WHY would you serve them to me?! With no other moisture in the dish, it hinged on the runny yoke.   So he takes the plate and I wait some more. Finally a woman brings it out and she's cordial enough but something about her gave an air of agitation. Well excuse me doll face for having a sense of culinary pride. I thanked her for my order and was happy to see things looked right. I broke the eggs and was very pleased as the yoke ran beautiful on my plate. I tucked into the meal and it was okay. There were missteps pertaining to layered flavoring and again, the key ingredients of Ossobuco. It definitely wasn't bad, but it wasn't really good or great either. It was just okay.  Do I think I'll eat her again? Nah. I never want to return to Vegas again!",

Though, I usually appreciated open quality of all the restaurant casinos in Vegas, this spot was a little too open to the guests moving in out of the Golden Nugget. It's no shocker when people are havin a good time in Vegas. Even being drunk at 2pm is a normal circumstance. I guess it's just not always appreciated while you're trying to enjoy a nice midday salad. Especially when you are there at the restaurant to escape the craziness that comes in out of the casino.  Don't get me wrong, I realize I need to stop by belly aching. It's Vegas after all: I just need to get used to it or get out; however the interruptions were incessant. If the restaurant was just a tad more closed off, it would be a quaint restaurant with actually very delicious food. In fact, the pizza sizes are generous and the Italian Chopped salad is topped with a lot of grilled chicken. The server was incredibly nice and patient with my parents who can be a tad overwhelming with requests.",

We started with Stuffed Mushrooms...always a perfect start.  We ordered a bottle of Reisling Wine...can't remember which brand but it was good.  We both left with a little buzz and that was even after we ate so much.  Next we moved onto the Tomato Caprese Salad...delicious.    For my main course I ordered the Penne Diavolo and my friend got the Seared Sea Bass.  Both dishes were superb.  And what meal wouldn't be complete without a little Creme Brulee to top it off.  Our service was excellent and the food was wonderful...by far the best meal I had my entire stay in Vegas.

The bolognese sauce was on the sweet side and the meatballs were pretty bland.  I suppose if you have an aversion to heavy amounts of garlic or cheese then this is ideal.  Prepare to augment with grated parmesan or even salt and pepper.   Despite the negatives I brought up, i would hit Grotto again next time Im in the area.",

They were one of a handful of restaurants that weren't diners or fast food that still open after the concert we went to was done.

Then waited another 15 to have one (bottled) beer brought to the table. Since finishing our meal, we have now waited a grand total of 39 minutes to pay our bill. It looks like they just don't have enough people on staff because these two girls are hustling, but it appears that they are the only two servers on the floor. Hire on some extra help guys! I don't mind waiting for food (it actually came out fairly quick once we ordered) but to have to wait this long for service is kind of ridiculous, especially during happy hour.  Again, super sad to say this because the food was great, but I definitely would not come back :(",

Since we were staying at the Golden Nugget, my wife suggested going here for dinner, and, after reviewing Yelp food photos, we decided on Grotto as much to avoid going outside in the heat as to appease the appetite the pictures generated.  First if all, consistently throughout our dining experience, Jeninne, our service specialist, took very good care of our table of four. She kept our glasses filled without being intrusive. Our order was correct and delivered correctly to each party member. We had the Calamari appetizer which was tender, lightly breaded and lightly crispy. Not only delicious but plenty for our table. Lobster bisque and Tomato bisque very, very good. Ceasar salads were both completely consumed. Our table made a custom entree request for Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo, not on the menu. This was received by the staff as \"Of course! No problem!\" and the dish was reported to be very tasty. Also ordered was the Mahi, Piscatore and Spaghetti and Meatballs. We were offered a second basket of bread without asking. The only small criticisms were some dishes needed salt added and there was no Cannoli on the dessert menu. We took dessert back to our room for later as the meal was so tasty. The total tab ran about $50 per person but you could easily spend less here and be well satisfied for dinner.",

We sat in a part of the restaurant that is separated from the rest by one of the resort's pathways. In some ways, that was nice, because it felt a little more private, and at the same time you could people watch. On the other hand, service may have been slowed just a tad, due to location. The food was good, and the cocktails were nice. The tiramisu was OK. I did enjoy the dessert cart coming over to show us what we could choose from. Nothing very outstanding, but nothing bad either.",

We had to wait a really long time at the Host desk to be greeted and seated and there were only 3 or 4 tables eating in the entire place there was really no excuse for the hostess to be MIA.  From there we got seated with a great view of the pool and we were introduced to our server. Great experience from there on out!  They brought out some ridiculously good bread with some oil and basalmic. We ordered a Margharita Pizza and a Casaer Salad to split and everything was incredibly good!  Great service and beautiful food at a decent price,  I will definitely be back!",

After reading reviews we tried the meatballs and weren't disappointed.  My husband thought they tasted like mine, which he loves !  Our entrees were two pizzas as we love east coast thin pizza and it is hard to find.  This pizza was great....the crust was really thin, almost cracker like on the edges and so delicious.  I loved the flavor of the cheese.  Save room for dessert because the cheesecake is like we had in NY and they have a yummy angel cake with strawberries.  We were happy to take home half of our pizzas and half of our desserts.  Seating was comfortable, warm bread served when you are seated...a really first class experience !!",

We were driving without a destination, with only the mutual purpose to find a restaurant somewhat near Cashman Field before Beau S. and went to the game. Remembering the wonderful smell wafting out of the Italian restaurant at the Golden Nugget two weeks prior, we ended up at Grotto.  At close to 5 PM yesterday (4/18/11) the place was empty. I don't know why but almost every time I go out to eat, the restaurants seem to be completely void of life. Our waitress took a bit to come take our order. Beau ordered an appetizer of fried ravioli after I noticed how small the $13 antipasti platter was that another table ordered. They were decent, but came with 8 pieces. I'm unsure of the exact price, but I know they were overpriced.  Beau ordered the chopped salad ($15) and I ordered the lobster bisque ($9) My soup was good but a bit small of a portion. Beau salad was more of a pulverized salad. The lettuce was chopped up into lady bug sized portions and he ended up eating the cheese out of it and leaving a bunch of salad still on the plate when we left.   The waitress was neither good nor bad. I think she forgot to bring us the bread basket and more refills would have been nice. Honestly, for $38ish, I think we could have gotten better food somewhere else.",

One of us had an order that got mucked up but the waitress handled it beautifully and got the right one to us within about 10 minutes.

    "text": "If the service wasn't TERRIBLE, Grotto would have gotten 4 stars because the food was delicious, but I am holding a grudge because of the service.  Located in the Golden Nugget on Fremont Street in DTLV, it is an upper-scale Italian restaurant.  I got the chicken parm, which was disproportionate with the pasta to chicken ratio...you'll be able to see in the attached picture.  There is legit one scoop of pasta and a chicken the size of my head.  It was still v good despite this.  Also got the calamari and lobster bisque for appetizers, also tasty.   But now for the airing of grievances:   I had to probably wait 20 minutes after the rest of my party's food came with no apology from the wait staff for my meal. The service all around sucked, if I'm being frank. Our water glasses were always empty.  The waitress forgot to bring out the lobster bisque soup, so we got it after dinner was served - isn't soup the appetizer (???!!!)  Took forever for our cocktails and not once did they check up on us.  It was a Friday night, so I would give them the benefit of the doubt if it was busy, but it wasn't...we were a party of 6 and ordered over $300 worth of food and beverages and got the worst service ever.  We will not be back here and I would advise you to chose a different place if you are in the area visiting.",

    "text": "First, the positives:  We were a large group of 20 people visiting Las Vegas for work, and we were able to get a reservation on short notice.  The restaurant itself is quite spacious and overlooks the hotel pool, which is a nice change from the usual dark and windowless spaces of most restaurants in Las Vegas casinos.  Second, the highlight:  Our waitress, Janine, was absolutely fantastic!  She handled our large order with courtesy and efficiency.  While the person who took our reservation on the telephone said \"that there was no way they could do separate bills,\" Janine did it without any fuss.  If the restaurant knows what's good for them -- i.e. excellent customer service -- they will give workers like Janine a well-deserved raise, promotion or bonus.  Now, the negatives:  The food at Grotto Ristorante is all right.  In fact, it was a bit bland.  I know Italian food very well, its flavor comes from fresh high-quality ingredients and just the right mix of oils and herbs.  That was not the case at the Grotto.  Finally, the major negative for us was the awful attitude of the restaurant manager.  A couple of us went to talk to him to put in a good word for Janine, and all he gave us in return was \"attitude.\" He did not even face us while talking to us [i.e. he needs to learn some basic manners], and when we highly recommended our waitress's excellent work, all he could say is \"I hope you come back!\" as if he had not even heard what we said.  Very unprofessional attitude!",

Things just are not the same.We still go there because it's convenient , edible, and fair pricing ,but I have yet to find a go to item on the menu.I used to love Grotto.The thing is, once you are downtown, the restaurants available are either $$$$ or $$ or $.I can recommend Triple George for $$$.They have three different areas for dining and a nice menu.May want to check it out.",

We make sure to have a meal here whenever we are in Vegas, and we always stay downtown so it certainly makes it a no brainer.  We haven't had anything that we didn't like.  I am especially fond of the chicken raviolis, the roasted red pepper cream & herbed veloute sauce is just to die for.   Definitely make sure not to fill up on too much bread before your food comes; it is very easy to do.  From appetizers, to the main course, and then on to dessert you just can not go wrong here.  The service is fantastic and the pricing is very reasonable.  Do not deny their goodness, and SAVE ROOM for dessert the Italian Wedding Cake is a must.",

We were welcomed right off and seated at a table with a view of the pool area. It may not sound like a view you would enjoy, but let me tell you it is better than any Vegas show. What a hoot watching people. Really a nice original 50's pool area. Our knowledgeable server, Robert, was fantastic. He has mastered unobtrusive pampering. Explained the food offerings and drinks and most importantly made us feel welcome and appreciated. We wanted a light lunch and a good white wine and he recommended the pear and cargonzola pizza with the house Pinot. Both were excellent. The manager paid us a visit when we were done and sincerely expressed his appreciation for our visit and for being Landry Select Club members. What a great fun experience we had. Definitely will keep going back.",

The Grotto is located inside of the Golden Nugget and is a little hidden. You have to actually go through the whole casino and walk towards the pool with the sharks in the large tank.  Service is wonderful, the food was alright and prices are a little higher then you would get a say Olive Garden and such. I was with a largish group, but that was no problem for them as they were able to get some tables together quickly. Joan, our waiter, was very attentive and could answer any question you could have about the menu including her awesome suggestion of the waffle fries for the kids in our group.  I ordered the homemade roasted chicken ravioli which came with soft polenta, mascarpone, roasted red pepper cream & herbed veloute. What half of that means? I have no clue, but it was not too shabby. Before my meal was brought out we were served some warm bread with oil. It was bread, it was good, no complaints there. As far as the raviolis... I was expecting multiple small ravioli's, but it is really just one big ravioli. The flavors went well together and created a nice warm meal on a cold Vegas day.  Overall it was not too bad, would I go back? Maybe if I was in the mood for non-fast food and or I wanted to get away from the hustle and bustle of the Fremont Experience.",

    "text": "During one of my last work trips in Las Vegas, I found myself stationed here at the Golden Nugget and feening for some food after an incredibly intense happy hour.  I learned of the Grotto by accident really - I was busy sipping glasses of wine and attempting to order bar food, only to learn that bar food was a delicious array of Italian fare.  Perhaps it was the alcohol doing the talking for me, because everything I had was inhaled in minutes.  The Montel Wrap, a parmesan crusted Chilean sea bass married with roma tomatoes and lettuce was better drunk food than the burger and fries I was initially fantasizing about.  Another winner was the lasagna and the margherita pizza was deceivingly tasty.  I managed to go back to my hotel room in a pseudo drunken food coma, a condition best experienced in Vegas.  I decided to come back during another night for dinner, this time sober and just as hungry.  Having witnessed the dining room for the first time, I realized it was easy to miss this place.  The Grotto doesn't stand out and the tacky decor wasn't going to win any awards either.  When examining a menu for a second time, it was clear Grotto's was a Italiana Americana restaurant, more than it was anything more authentic.  Service was good, almost too good for a downtown casino establishment.  They were courteous, professional, and prompt with everything.  I had a stellar recommendation in the very tasty ($9) lobster bisque, not too fishy and just a tad of creme.  Another solid dish was the linguine pescatore, but felt overpriced at $27 for a medium portion.  I also was able to try their herb crusted pork loin ($25), juicy and hearty, with a nice seared crust, had a nice flavor with it.  The yukon mashed potatoes were a nice touch but tasted like they were whipped with butter and sour cream.  Finally our table of hungry hippos decided it would be a good idea to order the sausage and peppers pizza.  The crust was a little charred, too much to a point where it was dry and mediocre.  I would give this another shot, especially since I've heard more former colleagues rave about this pizza than any other entree on their menu.  The Golden Nugget has a mini gem here with Grotto.  For downtown standards, this is a decent and semi-reasonably priced Italian option in an area where good food is hard to find.",

Service was a little spotty at first, but got better as the meal progressed. The fresh bread and seasoned olive oil was excellent. I had the Pollo Francese, which was just slightly overdone, but still good. My wife had  the Shrimp Griglia, which she liked. Just enough garlic to require a stick of gum after, but not enough to taste the next morning!  The best deal of the night was a Rigatoni Bolognese special for $10. Two of our friends ordered that dish, and they both felt they got their money's worth.   One disappointment is the inability to order a side salad with dinner. One of our party asked, and she was directed to the main salad menu, starting at $10. Missed opportunity, folks. You likely would have sold several salads at $5, but instead we kept asking for the free bread.   If you're looking for an easy, somewhat upscale alternative to standard downtown fare, the Grotto is a nice go-to in a pinch.",

The night starts with us arriving and the hostess giving us a wait time of an hour and forty-five minutes for a table of 5. Their was plenty of tables available to sit us and the other families that they were turning around with children. They tell us the wait was long due to a large party they had coming in of 18 and 20. Long story short the manager Neill seats us and our waiter Santos were the highlight of our service. Santos was johnny on the spot along with numerous other waiter that was walking around the resturant. The food was excellent, it was the best authentic Italian food that I had since I left Italy. The wedding party of 20 that was making everyone go elsewhere to eat was late and we ate, paid our check and leaving before they sat down. Will I return it depends on if the dirty blonde curly haired hostess is still their. The Manager Neill OUTSTANDING job for taking care of customers.",

I have been to the Golden Nugget, where this restaurant is located many times, but never ate here. Oh man, I was pleasantly surprised. I went in expecting typical Italian fare, a la Olive Garden, but I got much more. The calamari appetizer was amazing, tasted fresh and not too over fried. I ordered the chicken parmigiana, while my boyfriend ordered the Chicken Marsala. His came with an Italian salad, which was also pretty good for a salad. When our meals came we were amazed by the portion sizes. If I wasn't starving I probably could have saved half for another meal, the chicken piece was about the size of my face. Not even kidding. The boyfriends Chicken Marsala was about the same amount of chicken, just cut up and laid over a bed of mushroom risotto. Everything that I tasted here was amazing and the service was on point. I will for sure be back next time I come to town.",

From the warm bread they brought out in the beginning, to the meatball appetizers, then on to all of the 4 mains courses we had at the table...  DELISH!!!  One person had the lasagna, another had a rigatoni dish, another had a spicy seafood dish, and I had the Veal and Fettuccini dish. My stomach hurts and my mouth is still watering thinking about it. It was ALL so good!!!  Can't wait to come back for dessert :-D",

Service was fast & friendly and several people stopped to make sure we were satisfied & our glasses were filled.   Side Note: my husband left his credit card with the bill when we left. Our server turned it in to security & we were able to retrieve it. We are so thankful for the honesty of our server as that situation could have turned out much differently",

We went to a highly rated, celebrity chef owned/supported Italian restaurant just before visiting Grotto and man did Grotto restore my faith in the quality of Vegas food.  The pastas were perfectly cooked with delicious sauces. My pizza was soft, well appointed with toppings, and had awesome cheese. Our server almost seemed insulted when each of us said \"stop\" for our fresh grated Parmesan (I promise I had plenty on my pizza).  All the servers were wonderfully friendly and helpful. I do wish that they had done a bit better job cleaning the table (some splattered sauce specs were still visible), but it was not terrible considering we were at bar seating. The prices were reasonable for the amount of food and even though there was a wait we were accommodated in the bar area fairly quickly!  Definitely would return here if I needed to know I was getting a good meal in Vegas. Sadly there are just too many options to just pick one.",

A client told me about the Grotto and swears by the rigatoni, but after finding the late night happy hour i couldn't resist. 10:30-12:00 Sunday-Thursday you can get any of the pizzas on their menu for $8. Great sized pizzas as you can see in a number of photos, and tasty as well. The first time out i had the Meatzza which was fantastic. I then went again and tried the Spinach, pear, and gorgonzola and i honestly didn't care for it much (my fault for trying something different). I can't speak for anything else other than the happy hour which was enjoyable and finds me likely to return. Service was straight forward and the location was relaxed for being inside of a casino downtown so thumbs up.",

The bartender, Rich was extremely helpful in selecting food and sharing local stories.   We started with stuffed mushrooms topped with five cheeses in a light tomato basil sauce. I followed this up with the tomato basil soup which was very nice with a cream base.   We shared a rigatoni Bolognese. It was served  with large tasty meatballs and a tasty chopped salad. The Italian bread - crusty on the outside - came with a very nice olive oil garlic mix.   Everything was absolutely delicious!! We had way too much food, and took some back to our room for the ride home.   I almost forgot to mention their famous peach Bellini's. They are made with a mixture of vodka, Pinot Grigio, peaches, peach schnapps, A peachy syrup and of course champagne. It's sweet for my taste but everyone else would just love it. It is made fresh daily.  We will have to try to re-create this without the sweet stuff.   This place was just like going back to eat in Waterbury, Connecticut where they have great Italian food. Made me feel at home. I miss the good southern Italian cooking from Connecticut.",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times for decent italian fare. Stopped in for a pizza and beer on on a Friday afternoon. The pizza is a thin crust cooked in a wood fire oven, and is delicious, and the beer selection is decent. The service, however, is where we have a problem.  I found our server to be inattentive, scatterbrained, and borderline rude, all in one service. I've beed served by her before, and noticed some of these attributes previously, but this time, I'd had it. My wife and I ordered a beer and a glass of wine respectively. These took what felt like an eternity to bring to us. Once we got our food at the table, she flat out ignored us, failing to check up on us once. I'm sure the manager would be unhappy to know she lost 2 more beverage sales as a result. I know we weren't a high ticket table, but that doesn't mean you can give bad service. What was more annoying is we got to overhear how personable she could be while serving the two ladies at the adjacent table. When check time came, she dropped it and vanished like a vaudevillian magician in a puff of smoke before I could hand her my Landry's Select card. When I gave it to her, she acted as if it was a huge pain, and I should have told her sooner.  How could I? She was damn near avoiding interacting with us!  Now, I know there are two sides to every story. Usually when I read complaints about servers, I am open to the possibility that there is a reason the reviewer got bad service. Perhaps they were rude to the server, smelled bad, who knows. Let me tell you, I was raised to respect what a shitty job waiting tables is. I say please, thank you, and appreciate the grind. My wife is the same way. So I can honestly say that the attitude was totally unwarranted and from left field. As a result, I left an appropriate 15% tip and bailed. I will be sure to not be seated in her section again.",

With that said this authentic Italian restaurant was so good I had to create a Yelp just so I could share.   What we had: Lobster Bisque = 5 Stars rich, creamy with chunks of fresh lobster  Meatball Appetizers = 4 Stars original Italian meatball, very good, I would of liked more herbs and spices but still a delicious meatball Cheese Tortillini = 5 Stars beautifully plated, delicious pesto sauce, pasta cooked perfectly   I agree with another yelper about how it's openness in the hotel allows for whoever to walk in and out so you get people who may already be intoxicated walking up to have a cocktail (we had a somewhat loud table near us) but hey it's Vegas and we chose to sit in the bar section....I'm not complaining personally just stating. Didnt take away from the decor and food though.  Excellent service (Tony) who was knowledgable about food and drinks, friendly, and attentive. Even brought out the desert tray at the end but we were full. If your in the area definitly check this place out, worth the $",

My friend ordered a saffron risotto, and I made her send it back as it tasted like an old dish rag.  They made a big fuss about our complaint and two different people came over to the table to discuss why we didn't like the risotto.  They insulted us by insinuating that we didn't know that saffron has a different taste, whatever......it was still bad. When we received the bill it was taken off, all $4.99 of it. You would have thought it was a big ticket item the way the restaurant was reacting to our complaint.          We did enjoy the beer that was micro brewed there, I believe it was called Sin City.          After gazing around the room, I think the hot item in the restaurant was pizza, ah hindsight.",

Soup was simple and perfect, not too acidic and basil played nice side kick to it. Pizza had so much flavor, I rubbed my tongue many times just to taste everything in my mouth. Very satisfying.

I ordered the Seabass, and was thoroughly enjoying it, until I found a cockroach on my plate.  A COCKROACH ON MY PLATE!  The insect was incorporated in the sauce.  The waiter and manager on duty both offered sincere apologies, and comped the table.  I expected the chef to offer an apology, but he seemed too busy since it was a Monday...? The real fail here is the response I got from the GM after I emailed him about my experience.  He explained that his restaurant has policies and procedures to guard against things like this from happening.  I believe him.   He also told me nothing like this has ever happened at his restaurant in the past.  I am not so sure. As I was telling another co worker my experience (I too am in food service, so this experience served as a good training tool), she informed me of a well known roach infestation at the Golden Nugget.  I did a quick Google search, and found several news articles about the roach problem at that property.  Employees of the property have been complaining for YEARS.  As recently as Dec 2012, restaurants were closed as a result of the infestation.  Yet this was the first time there has been an issue at Grotto?  Possibly... While comping a table of four is gracious (and expected under the circumstances), it certainly isn't enough, knowing what I know now, for me to give ANY restaurant at the Golden Nugget another try.",

The Grotto is a decent, physically darker version of Olive Garden-type resto partially open to the casino floor.  The waitstaff was friendly and swift, but they did seem rushed as there always seemed to be a wait to get a table.   The bread served before the meal is soft and doughy; comes with a chili-garlic olive oil for dipping. The bruschetta was awesome - long buttery, crusty oblongs of bread lightly drizzled with balsamic, topped with a fresh garlicky tomato tapenade. The bf and I gobbled that shit up quick. I ordered the rigatoni with meat sauce, very good with that comforting feel, and the bf had the chicken canneloni which he apparently loved (none left) and I thought was ok (one bite). Prices weren't dirt cheap but so much less than eating at a comparable hotel eatery on the strip. One day, Mario's, but on this day, Grotto fit the bill just fine.",

I grew up eating my way through North Beach w/my Grandmum, so we are a bit snobbish and jaded when it comes to our Italian food. I was surpirsed to find something this good in Downtown Las Vegas. I love sitting in the extended dining room area so I can check out the pool!   ;)",

It took another 45 min to get our main courses.  The salad was fair, the soup was dishwater, the main courses of encrusted Mahimahi was testless, the pasta was overcooked, the other main course, chicken, was covered in a sludge sauce.  Skip this restaurant.  There are other good Italian restuarants in Las Vegas",

We had set our stuff down at a table and never saw a waiter so we assumed we had to order at the bar. I left my purse on a chair and went two steps away to the bar and magically a waitress appeared straightening chairs. Well..she joked that my purse was at one of her tables, but I got the distinct vibe I should move my bag. So...we sat at the bar and had a great time.

We ordered a pizza (chicken with goat cheese and other things...can't remember the exact name) and entree sized salad to split among the two of us and I had a glass of wine.  The food was excellent and even though we were stuffed, we had to finish the pizza!  The only negative was that it took our waiter forever to come to our table.  We waited probably 10 minutes for him to even come take our drink orders...when he came, we quickly put in our whole order.  It also took a while for him to come at the end of the meal.",

The atmosphere is very nice and the service is fairly good. They are especially attentive with the water for some reason!

    "text": "Had a nice lunch at Grotto the last time we were in town. We were meeting my junior high school classmates for lunch. Our flight got in a little before lunchtime so we made our way to Downtown soon after retrieving our rental car. Grotto is located inside the Golden Nugget Casino & Hotel. I'm very familiar with the Nugget having stayed there in the past but had never dined at Grotto. One of our classmates is a Vegas local and suggested dining there. It was definitely a good call.   We ordered calamari for our table and I went with the grilled chicken panini minus the mozzarella. It also came with roma tomatoes and mayo. The sandwich was very good. The grilled chicken was tasty and not dry. The chicken was also cut into pieces and I was real happy with it. The waffle fries the panini came with were very good. I really liked them. Nicely seasoned and went well with the panini. Good sandwich. I would get again in the future. The plate came with a small bowl of ketchup for dipping the waffle fries. I liked that.   Other entrees ordered at our table were the portabello panini, pizza and pasta bolognese. Everyone was very happy with their individual orders. The calamari was great. It came with marinara dipping sauce and lemon to squeeze accordingly. Great appetizer.   Service was good. Water for everyone. A moscow mule. sodas... All brought to our table with a smile. Manager on duty was very personable and we enjoyed our meal at Grotto for sure. Definitely a place to check out when at or around the Nugget.",

    "text": "Staying in downtown Las Vegas on Fremont Street tends to offer a wide variety of food as well as entertainment. Searching on Yelp for something not visibly available from the street level view, my husband found this wonderful place.   We came in with a preset menu (pizza, of course) and ordered. My husband ordered a local beer and I just had some tea. The tea was good, however it only comes in unsweetened so that you may add your own sugar. I guess that's ok, but I am used to getting sweet tea (as I am from the South).   First thing to arrive was the bread and garlic infused oil dip. It was hot, fresh with a crispy crust and a hot, light, airy center! I could have made a meal just from the bread! In order to enjoy our main course, I elected --reluctantly--to have only one piece.  Pizza arrives and it is hot and fresh, the waiter-Jose- grated fresh Parmesan over half of the pizza since my husband prefers to have red pepper flakes on his half. The crust was very light and so thin that you could read the newspaper through it. The sauce was perfect with just a hint of sweet to it. The pepperoni was tasty and not overwhelming on the sauce base. I will definitely return.  A shout out to our waiter Jose and the pizza maker himself-Joe: Jose, thank you for being so helpful and friendly, it was a pleasure to make your acquaintance. Joe, this is one of the best pies I have ever had in Las Vegas! Please be assured that we will be back! Thanks for a great meal, gentlemen!",

    "text": "WARNING TO ALL VEGETARIANS - This restaurant adds MEAT to dishes without any warning!  We went last night - I ordered Vongole - listed on the menu as containing 'Linguine, clams, lemon, garlic, pinot grigio broth, garlic parsley crunch\".  I started eating the dish and then realized that there was prosciutto in it!!!! I told the server - he said he would get a 'manager'. After quite a wait, a female manager came over. She seemed entirely unbothered by the situation and did not really seem to understand how big a deal it was, adding pork to a dish and NOT saying this on the menu!  Her reply was simply 'we have noted your concerns and will pass this onto upper management', like she was reading a standard 'how to respond to customers who complain' script! When I asked if maybe the chef had simply made a mistake and added prosciutto when they were not meant to - she said that actually no that was not the case - the recipe for this dish was changed recently.... When I asked her how long ago 'recently' was, she said last JUNE!!!!! So let me get this straight..Last June (8 months ago) you decided that you needed to add prosciutto to your Vongole, but nobody thought it would be a good idea to say this on the ingredient list on the menu? I mean you list that the dish has 'garlic parsley crunch' , but you dont think its important to mention that this seafood dish has pork in it!!!  The worse thing about the situation was that the manager was entirely unapologetic. She didnt seem to care about the fact that I had just eaten pork for the first time in my entire life, and didn't really see it as a problem at all. She acted like it was no big deal at all. She honestly just seemed bothered that we had even brought this up - like she was thinking 'oh big deal - you ate a little bit of pork - get over it!' All 4 of us at the table are non pork eaters, so by now we were all grossed out by the entire meal. I mean who knows how many other dishes have pork added to them, seeing as the restaurant seems to be in the habit of adding pork to dishes and then not telling you on the menu. TLDR Do not eat here unless you are okay with having prosciutto randomly added to your dish!",

    "text": "I visited on a hot Saturday afternoon for 1:45 PM late lunch.  My friend was fiending for Fettuccine Alfredo and we were in the Downtown area for the day.  Service: 2/5 Our waitress tried her best, but didn't keep the drinks and water filled on a very hot day.  For lunch they sat us across in a dining area across the walkway of the main dining room which was very warm because of the glass walls right by the pool.  The food came out timely but we had to find her on numerous occasions for drinks and to eventually close out the bill.  Food: 3/5 The calamari portion was large and very good,  Tasty and cooked perfectly.  My rigatoni was very good.  The sauce and the pasta were great and complimented each other well.  My friend ordered the chicken fettuccine alfredo and she added shrimp to the dish.  The shrimp and the chicken were fine but the sauce and the pasta were average at best.  The sauce didn't have enough cheese and the pasta seemed liked something you could buy at the grocery store and unfortunately didn't meet our expectations.  The Cheesecake topped with strawberry sauce was excellent.  Big slice and was the perfect amount of creaminess for a cheesecake.  Value: 3/5 The lunch chicken fettuccine alfredo was $16 and adding shrimp was an additional $9.95.  If the sauce and pasta were better, I might be ok with this as they gave good portions of shrimp and chicken.  The Rigatoni at $18 was fine but I've had better for similar pricing.  With so many great Italian food options in Las Vegas, they're falling a little short in terms of what you pay for vs what you receive.  Tito's and Tonics were $10.50 a drink here.  Ambiance: 3/5 The Main dining room looked nice, but they sat all but two parties in the area across the way by the pool.  I'm sure it's a different ambiance in the dining room at night but I'm rating on sitting in the hotter area by the glass walls overlooking the pool.  Summary: I feel like this is one of those restaurants where their best performance comes out in the evening.  If I'm in the area for an evening and I'm feeling Italian food, I'm willing to see how the dinner experience is as compared to their average mid-afternoon lunch.  Italian food downtown as in life, timing is crucial sometimes.  Enjoy... =)",

    "text": "Came here looking for something sit down and a bit \"nicer\" as we were staying at the Downtown Grand. Both the ambiance and the food was just okay to me. Service was great, we had a nice view of the pool and tank, but I found the food at Maggiano's better and probably cheaper too!   We had the prosciutto wrapped sea bass over veggies/potato - the veggies were really good. I think my husband had the mistake of of asking for his fish more well done than seared coz then the prosciutto was over done (and kinda tasted burned/fuel) and did no justice to the fish. I just had crispy risotto and meatballs. Both were good but nothing to write home about or something I couldn't make myself.   The service really makes this place stand out. With so many places to try in Vegas, I don't think I'd come back here anytime soon but it is a safe choice if you're pressed for time and are in the hotel.",

If your next stop after Grotto is within walking distance, fine, but it's certainly not worth getting in a cab and driving downtown from the LV strip.   It literally took 35 minutes to receive our fried calamari appetizer unfortunately, it wasn't worth the wait since the dish was  overcooked (rubbery) and extremely salty.   For my entree, I ordered the Veal Kickerillo. The menu description read: Parmesan-crusted scaloppine with mushrooms & a touch of lemon served with fettuccine Alfredo. What I received was 4 small and paper thin medallions all the exact same size with 1 slice of a mushroom on top. I honestly believe there was more breading than veal.   The highlight of the evening was when a homeless women approached our table for money. Right in the middle of the dining room.",

    "text": "We hadn't been down to the Golden Nugget for awhile and so we decided to head over and have dinner at the Grotto.    We were quite surprised how busy the whole place was for a Sunday night,  Good for the hotels bottom line, but it was just too busy and a bit too noisy for our liking.  We were seated fairly quickly, (we'd made a reservation) and the hostess was pleasant and provided good service.  It took a bit of a wait for our waitress Carol to get around to us, but when she did, she provided good, friendly and courteous professional service.  The only negative we experienced is that my wife found her dish the Mahi, to be a bit off putting since we hadn't paid attention to the description on the menu.  We called over Neil the manager on duty and he explained the fish was wrapped in angel hair pasta.  (Who ever thought up that idea in our view has a screw loose!  It made the fish yucky to look at and taste). Neil kindly offered to make up a new order without the pasta and it came back perfect.  Much nicer to have a nice piece of fish cooked simply with sauce rather than some sort of pasta concoction wrapping it.  With the pasta it covered the quality of the fish, without it the fish was quite nice and very well done.  Neil, also offered us a comped dessert which we took him up on after we spent some time in the casino.  The tiramisu was yummy and Neil came by and greeted us again, which was quite nice.  Overall, I'd rate our whole experience a B+ on a grading scale.  Quite pleasant, with some minor room for improvements.",

She was knowledgable about the wine and food pairings and recommended great dishes.  Antipasti- 5 stars Cannelloni Di Pollo- 4 stars Chicken Picatta- 4 stars Tiramisu- 5 stars But what blew me away was the Margherita Pizza. Wow. Thin, crispy crispy baked in a stone oven. Just wow.

I asked if there would be a plate sharing charge, the waiter says, no, we just require a smile.  They split the bisque into two smaller bowls and they did the same for the dinner.    Everything tasted great and the service was as expected.  They brought out the dessert cart, which included chocolate cake, a cheese cake, a 7 layer strawberry wedding cake and espresso with biscotti.  We had to pass because we were full.  Next time we will get you, dessert cart.  Next time.",

    "text": "We went because of the many reviews and it was near the hotel where our friends were staying. Pleasantly surprised by the pretty interior and our table had a wonderful view of the pool & shark tank.   None of us had starters but a basket of bread was brought to the table along with some olive oil. NOTHING special about the bread-it could have came from Smith's or Albertson's...   I had the Cannelloni (17.99) which was stuffed with chicken and spinach, with bechamel and marinara sauce. The plate was served with 2 cannellonis which were delicious. My husband had the Filet alla Griglia (34.99), a center-cut filet with Italian roasted potatoes and asparagus topped witha rich Borolo demi-glace. He enjoyed every bite & said the asparagus was cooked perfectly!. One friend had the Fettuccine alla Campagnola(17.99) which had chicken, mushrooms, peas, mozzarella in a sugo rosa sauce. She said it was very good. Our other friend had the Rigatoni della Sansoni (18.99) which had a meat sauce and is normally topped with homemade meatballs but our friend asked if italian sausage could be substituted instead , which they did with no hesitation or extra charge.   The staff was very pleasant & attentive without being intrusive.   That said, I can only give this restaurant 3/5 stars.  There is no way we would go out of our way to eat here again given all of the italian eateries in town and given the price, nothing we tasted was \"out of this world\" and portions were very small and only a few of the pricier entrees came with sides (albeit very small portioned sides).",

We held meet & greet social to allow our out of town friends to visit with us before all the busyness of the wedding.  Mark was the ideal server who made food and wine suggestions that all 12 of us enjoyed!  The pasta dishes here are excellent but the pizza is definitely the star! All of them are good so choose your favorite with confidence!  The meatball appetizer is also fantastic with its scrumptiously seasoned interior complementing its crunchy exterior - my husband highly recommends this to accompany any dish.   The Grotto Bar was one of our \"go-to\" spots when we done sightseeing and wanted a good drink in a nice environment.  They have a full bar and an excellent wine selection.  The big screens were nice as well and during one visit we were able to chill and watch a Giants game!  :D   As stated earlier, we had several other meals here during our stay (lunch and dinner) and each time the food was outstanding and the service was friendly. You can't miss with Grotto!",

My son's pizza was very inexpensive ($5?) and he loved it.  My other son's penne with red sauce was also inexpensive but a very small portion.  I ended up spooning my side (noodles) over to his dish; we were both full and happy.  The strawberry cake was also huge and to die for, delish, really great.  Service would be my only complaint.  Our server was REALLY quite, or he hated us, one or the other.  He would hardly acknowledge or speak to us, we were not sure if he was really shy or what but our food made up for everything.  I would say that I was not impressed that once we left the table he ran over to check the bill/tip, a bit cheap in my eyes, especially for such a nice place.  Make a reservation if you can, and go ready to eat.  Enjoy!!",

Anyway, we expected Grotto to be an expensive version of Olive Garden, but we were pleasantly surprised.    First of all, our waitress was wonderful.  She helped us choose entrees, and suggested that we split a salad.  Hubby had a sea bass encrusted with a pasta-type coating.  He thought it was terrific.  I had a veal marsala, which was very good.  Our side dishes were also very well done.    The desserts were the best!  When you're done eating, they wheel out a dessert cart.  Naturally, everything makes your mouth water.  We shared a cake layered with cream and strawberries.  Light and decadent!    The atmosphere was okay -- we got to look out into the pool and fish tank area.  My only complaint would be the noise.  Like most restaurants in Vegas, the restaurant is open to a corridor with people constantly walking through.   If you're downtown and want to eat at a nice Italian restaurant, I would highly recommend Grotto.",

Our server offered to take it back and have them make a fresh batch of the stuff after he saw we had hardly touched it.  The pizza I ordered was really good...and really BIG! Do NOT order one of these for yourself, they are big enough for two. The margherita pizza was delicious and really hit the spot. Also had a glass of their house red to go with it.

Food.. well it was pretty good. I had chicken and it was tasty.. Not the best in the free world but it was good enough to go back. I liked the servers who were pretty cool and on it with drink service. I got tons of water refills and vodka tonics one after the other.. So overall I would return",

My husband and I come here all the time because the food is phenomenal, but if we are not spending literally several hundred dollars on dinner we have noticed they could care less about us. Every single time we go there to grab a quick pizza or some bruschetta and a cannelloni and a drink we are ignored until my husband finally says something. (If we are having a full course meal with drinks and our bill reaches several hundred then its a little different.) It's very unfortunate because that's becoming the last place we go especially when we have company.  The ambiance is lovely and again the food is wonderful but whether im spending 100 dollars or 300 dollars it would be nice to get the same well rounded service.",

I was in a group of 4 and we decided to do family style and get a pizza that was great and chopped salad for an app and then two entrees--chicken parm which I get at almost every italian place and it was excellent and we got the garlic shrimp that was just fair.

    "text": "Top notch service, good food, and beautiful atmosphere make this place a WIN at the Golden Nugget!   Went here for a 'romantic' dinner during happy hour on a Tuesday. The bar tender was the best server we had on the whole trip. He recommended we sit in the bar to take advantage of half price pizzas and $2 off drinks! Thanks, man! It was a completely affordable delicious meal. Their pizzas are wood fired with top shelf ingredients. We also ordered the meatballs, which were garlicky and good, plus the ravioli alla vodka, which tasted fresh and well balanced. Overall, the service put it over the top and we were very happy we happened into the Grotto.   When our party of 11 decided to go downtown for Christmas Day, my boyfriend and I suggested Grotto to the family for Christmas dinner. We were glad we did! Everyone was impressed! The service was amazing, again and the food was well prepared. Everything was on point. The appetizers were priced at $8-$15. Bruschetta was excellent. Fried ravioli was a touch overdone. My favorite dish I tried was the chicken francais. I ordered the chicken marsala accompanied by fresh fettuccine Alfredo, which was good, but not the best I've had. The ciabatta bread was soft and hot and the dipping oil was really well flavored. Desserts looked amazing, but I was stuffed. The favorite of the table was a ricotta cream and strawberry bombe, which was beautiful.   This was by far the best family meal we had in Vegas and I would recommend Grotto to anyone looking for perfect service and good Italian food!",

They lived up to my expectations and exceeded.  First off, Hugo was our waiter.  He was very attentive the entire time and very friendly.  I didn't have breakfast that day so I was wanting more of a larger lunch, so I ordered the Grotto spaghetti and meatballs.  Salad and bread first came out.  Salad was good, but the bread was amazing.  Very crusty on the outside and pillow soft and warm on the inside.  Then the lunch came.  The noodles were perfectly al dente, and the two meatballs on it were huge and very tasty and tender.  Perfectly done.  Probably one of the best pasta and meatballs I've had, all for a price that's not overly inflated like a lot of the other restaurants in the downtown area and strip.  I would recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal at a reasonable price around Fremont St.",

    "text": "OLD VEGAS ITALIANO   Came here with a group of my co-workers to celebrate the MARCH BIRTHDAYS.   The resteraunt is located right next to the hotel pool & they have an awsome view of the shark tank too. The decor make me think of how an italian resteraunt looked like back in the days. There were also cool looking blown glass chandeliers. The lighting was dim & the place was packed.  We had a party of 5 & the host seated us quickly followed by our server to greet us. I wish I remembered his name because he is what made this review a 5 star. He was very professional & informed us about the specials for the night.   We started off with some cocktails that came out quickly & he gave us a few minutes to look over the menu. We were given hot fluffy bread at the beginning and with some garlic infused olive oil.  TOMATO CAPRESE $12.99 - we ordered 2 and they split it up for us and also added one more mozzarella-tomato-basil & so each dish got 2 pieces which was nice but we couldn't even eat more than one because they were so big.   LOBSTER BISQUE $9.99 - it was nice & delicious but definately cannot have one serving to myself  SPINACH & ARTICHOKE DIP $9.99 - can't really go wrong with this appetizer   PENNE CON GAMBERI AL LIMONE $20.99 - this was the dish I ordered & I have to say that it was just okay. The pasta it self could have used more flavoring because it was a bit bland... the shrimps had a lot of flavor though.  PROSCIUTTO-WRAPPED CHILEAN SEABASS $29.99 - it was delicious... presentation was a little plain but it was gonna be eaten regardless. The seabass was cooked to a perfect medium temperature.  CIOPPINO $35.99 - this was a flavor packed dish. Lots of different seafood from clams to crab claws with the flavorful broth it comes in.  ITALIAN CHOPPED $17.99 - the dressing was tossed in & there was a bite of every ingredient of tomato.onion.feta.kalamata olives. Grilled chicken. The chicken was also juicy & not dried out.  CHICKEN PICATTA $19.99 - didn't get to try this one ahhahaha  COCONUT CREAM PIE $7.99 - OMG it was just filled with cream but there was just enough toasted coconuts on the outside to give a little texture & flavor along with the pie crust.  TIRAMISU $7.99 - you could taste a little bit of the alcohol which was great & it literally melted away the moment it touched your toungue which is exactly what I look for in a tiramisu! The decor presentation was cute too.  CREME BRULEE $7.99 - simple but the least of my favorites out of all the desserts but only because it just tasted like a really good normal creme brulee. The sugar crust on top was perfect & the creme inside was creamy soft perfection.  STRAWBERRY CASSATTA $7.99 - my first experience & the light angel cake on the inside was amazing with the cream & fresh strawberries with strawberry sauce... DROOL  CAPACCINO $4.50 BOTTLE OF ARGYLE PINOT NOIR $65  The fact that he lit up a candle for every single one of the desserts was a very awsome touch to the whole dinner. One sad thing was that they didn't offer anything little for dessert which would have just been a nice touch.   ALL-IN-ALL service was great... ambience & decor was wonderful & fun... food was delcious... didn't really realize timing for everything because we came to dine & enjoy ourselves so you don't realize the timing on anything. But i know we were there for over 2 hours!!! =]",

So I told the server it was my husband's birthday hoping that that would get him a free dessert because one of the other restaurants said that if it's your birthday to let them know and that they would accommodate you for such things in Las Vegas. Well not the case here but it was worth it to spend the $8 for dessert we had that Dome cake thingy that has whipped cream and strawberries it was very delicious the restaurant put Happy Birthday in writing on his plate. The pasta was very good and so was the chicken that I had and my husband Seafood dish I forgot what it was called but he loved it. The chef came out to ask if we were pleased with the meal and yes we were. The prices are not bad and the quality is very good. Just don't expect a free be for your birthday or any occasion the waitress said They don't serve freebies for such occasions.",

    "text": "I was excited to try this place out, lots and lots of great reviews; the place is within the Golden Nugget and right across from the shark tank.  We had a reservation for a party of 14, and they were able to accommodate us, our server Denise was chatty and friendly, she asked where we were all from, it was an even split between California and Arizona. She even remembered most of our names, and she told us she was 63, man she didn't look it at all! Life has been kind to her.  After glancing over the menu 1st thing that caught my eye, damn this place is pricy, for a bowl of spaghetti and sauce was 20 bucks, that stuff better be amazing!  Also on the table they brought out fresh sourdough bread and oil with spicy herbs, that was pretty tasty too, the bread was delish!  So after the sticker shock, I went with the Pollo Romano and small Caesar salda (additional 4.99 charge). The Caesar salad had crisp romaine lettuce, garlic croutons, a great tasting Caesar dressing and was blanketed in Parmigiano-Reggiano cheese. It was a great tasting salad,  The Pollo Romano, on the menu had great potential, it Romano-crusted chicken scaloppini with artichokes & Roma tomatoes in a white wine sauce served with penne sugo rosa for $19.99, I guess I should have really pay attention to the scaloppini part of the chicken, man my chicken was small, almost to the point of not being there, it was 2   pieces about the size of a half dollar and as thin as a sheet of paper, super small, piled on top a heaping mound of spinach with 1 artichoke heart cut in half propped to make the chicken appear bigger and to the side of this was a huge mound of pasta with minimal sauce, so very disappointed in my dinner, did it taste good, yea the 2 bites of chicken was great in flavor, the white wine sauce was thin and sparse, the mound of spinach felt like it was never ending, and the pasta was cooked all the way but was very dry. I do not feel this meal was worth the price. Everyone was under wowed by their meal, but had a great time enjoying everyone's company.  Sometimes you can't believe the hype of a place, and I feel this place falls in that category.",

    "text": "My husband took me here in August 7th 2016 for our anniversary dinner while visiting Vegas. It's located in the Golden Nugget casino.    They start you with bread and dipping oil. The bread was house made and had an amazing garlic aroma and flavor, perfectly warm and soft inside and that nice crisp crunch on the outside. The garlic oil complimented this wonderfully.    My husband ordered a chicken Alfredo dish that was out of this world. The flavor and consistency of the sauce was spot on and the pasta and chicken were cooked perfectly. The dish was beautifully presented.    I ordered a sausage marinara dish, which again flavor, presentation and food were spot on. By far the best Italian food we've had.      For desert I ordered the tiramisu and my husband ordered the cheesecake. Both were very good and had we not ordered the cheesecake we would have raved about the tiramisu, but we DID order the cheesecake and well we needed up being the tiramisu home and took our time delighting in this AHmazing cheesecake. The consistency was perfect and the best creamy texture and taste. We're big cheesecake fans and my husband is a cheesecake \"snob\" and we were both blown away with this one!    The service was equally as great from hostess, waiter and the gal who kept filling up our waters. Smiling pleasant and went out of their way to make out night special! Well done grotto!",

Sometimes I will take a crew member or two with me. Last Saturday I had the Italian Chopped Salad with some hot bread. His the spot and priced right. I am told they have a great happy hour.

The spinach dip was one of the best I've tried and the Meatzza was very flavorful.

A friend and I decided to go to Fremont street to look for souvenirs and see the lights so we decided to look up a place on online/yelp. I found grotto ristorante had pretty good reviews, didn't look extremely pricey, and we wanted to see the golden nugget anyways so I thought we'd give it a try.  I don't have a bad word to say about this place but my expectations weren't that high either. I got linguine pescatore and it was AMAZING! I loved that there was so much seafood piled on that I couldn't even see the pasta at first. The service was excellent and I loved that we got seated by the pool where we could watch people go down the slide and watch the Sharks/fish swim. My friend and I also stayed for dessert. She got tiramisu and I got orange creme brulee. I got to taste her tiramisu and both desserts were amazing. This ended up being my favorite meal in Vegas!",

Even when we tried to engage our waitstaff in conversation, they acted like they couldn't be bothered. Of the 9 of us, 5 ordered different pizza's. When the food was delivered, there was 1 pizza missing. It appears the waiter either didn't add it to the ticket or it was not completed in the kitchen. I had the spinach & gorgonzola pizza and it was horrible. It had nice flavor, but the crust was not cooked enough and it was soggy in the middle. My sister had the sausage & pepper pizza, and it too was disappointing - only 1 slice of bell pepper, and the sausage tasted horrible. Even at the end of the meal when the waiter was clearing plates, he asked how I liked my pizza. I told him what I said here, but no apology offered - it was like he really didn't care. There are many other restaurants in Vegas - I'd skip this one!",

The Italian bread in the bread basket was okay.  So were the two meatballs that I had for an appetizer.  One was medium and the other medium-well in doneness.  The mild Marinara Sauce that accompanied the meatballs was quite good.  And, a Half Caesar Salad featuring chopped Romaine Lettuce was nice and cheesy.    My mushroom-covered main dish of Veal St. Pietro in a very tasty cream sauce was nice and hot, and very good.  Sauteed Spinach and Roasted Potatoes accompanying this dish were also tasty but warm rather than hot.  Service was very good and on target throughout my stay.  This dinner ended on a high note with an excellent tasting, large slice of Mezza Notte Chocolate Fudge Cake and Vanilla Gelato for me, and excellent Tiramisu with Vanilla Cream for Diane.  Both desserts were very rich and decadent!",

Once we had drinks, our server didn't return for a loooong time after that to take our order.    Now all this being said, he was very nice and our service from placing our  order to the time we were finished/paying was good.  Not great, but good.  The food was very good and there was not one complaint there.  We ordered bruschetta, salads, meatballs, ravioli and rigatoni.  All were delicious.    I am certain had we been able to sit in the dining room, the service would have been better.  We were at a low table so even the bartender couldn't really see us unless she was right at the edge of that side of the bar.  We were overlooking the Casino hall/walkway, so probably not where people would want to put their focus.  Overall, after the initial slow service, the food and experience was good.",

We ate there without looking it up beforehand so I'm honestly shocked to see it has so many rave reviews.  Food was unimpressive. Neither myself or my boyfriend cared for what we ordered. Restaurant was practically empty but we were seated in a side section across the hall, looking out at the pool area. I loved having a direct view of a bunch of women in super revealing swimsuits, and women tanning with their tops undone, while at what was supposed to be a romantic date night dinner before a show on the strip. Of course, it took a while to receive our food so we got to enjoy the view for a while! Despite the wait, the waitress didn't check on us between taking our order and us getting the food or I would have asked to be moved. I expect to see nearly naked people while outside - it's Vegas! But it is not what I'm looking for when we are dressed up and eating at a nice sit down restaurant. It was just not a pleasant experience and did not start off our evening as I'd hoped.  Some people might not mind the view - I wouldn't care earlier in the day for a more casual lunch atmosphere. But the food truly was nothing special and neither was the service. There are so many amazing food options in Vegas, I wouldn't waste your time or money here.",

Loved the old fashioned east coast restaurant style here (giant wheeled around desert tray - the size of a hotel luggage cart), and the food was cooked to perfection with care with beautiful presentation. Great location with easy access to Fremont St, yet a nice break from the chaos of Fremont.",

I sat at the bar and first asked which pasta is fresh. The server just explained how they drop in in water. No big deal. So I order chicken Marsala and ask to substitute penne or rigatoni with marinara for the side. I'm next served bowl of rigatoni and thought nice they even bring the pasta first!  Nope wrong meal...they told me I could try it but then promptly took it away when my actually meal arrived. Pasta was mush, Marsala tasted like it was from a jar, marinara was way too sweet. I mean they are trying but definitely not worth the money.",

    "text": "This was a great find near Fremont Street.  All of the nicer \"sit down\" restaurants were booked solid and require a reservation.  There seems to be a big gap between the really cheap fast casual type places and the actual fancy sit down places.   Fortunately, there's Grotto to fill the gap perfectly.    Six of us were looking for a place to eat with no reservation and we couldn't get in most places until late.  Someone recommended we try the Grotto and we were able to sit at a high-top near the bar after only a 15 minute wait.  It was perfect.  The pizza is really good.  I was surprised at how good the salads were and the service was really excellent.  I agree with the comments about the Venetian dessert, it's worth saving room for.  Overall, this is a great place for a nice casual sit down meal in the otherwise crazy world of Fremont  / Nugget.  I was really glad we ate here",

Too sweet for me to have more than one and should have had it for dessert but still tasty. Drink specials were decent but the $10 pizza was a steal! All pizzas in the menu were included. It was probably 8 decent sized slices with a nice crisp crust. The toppings were plentiful and we were glad we didn't order 2 because the size was large. We did order a spinach artichoke dip that was served with toasted bread slices. This tasted fine but was a very thin consistency. Not expected at all. Hence my 4 star rating. Our service was great. The server even came right before HH was over to see if we wanted more drinks before prices went up! Would definitely give this place a try if you are down on Fremont street.",

I know its just water, but it really made it taste great.  Surprisingly, it didn't even taste like desert tap water to begin with.  The bread is tasty and comes with a garlicky, spicy olive oil.  Yum!  I had a creamy pasta with regular and spinach noodles, prosciutto, peas, and lots of parmesan.  My sig other had meatballs with marinara and a caesar salad.  Those meatballs were somethin' else.  Crispy on the outside and delicious on the inside.  A great meal.  The best part of all was the desserts.  They brought out a tower on wheels that puts the term dessert cart to sham.  An unbelievable good looking chocolate cake, Italian wedding cake, four flavors of gelato, tiramisu,  spectacular strawberry cheesecake, and a few others.  I went with the pistachio gelato and I'm glad I did.  It was so delicious and a perfect pick for this gelato lover.  They even make it right there in the restaurant.  There is a row of tables on the outside with a view of the fish tank/exhibit.  Make sure to get a reservation if you want one of those tables.   I would have if I had known.  I also saw them hand making the pizzas.  Nice touch.  The service was very good.  Ciao!",

Honestly, Carrabas is better.   The price of this joint was ridic. I spent $44 bucks on some bland and mushy mussels, a plate of soggy calamari and a meh salad. I realize seafood might not have been the hot ticket, so I tried my friends dishes. More blah. Where did the flavor go? Ive been to some amazing Italian places, at prices from $ to $$$$. Price doesn't usually indicate quality, but here at this price I expected a lot more. Hell if it was half what I paid I would've been sorely disappointed.  Case in point, we ate at Brio in a mall on the south end of the strip before we flew out. Again it was a meal of seafood appetizers and salad. WITH a bottle of wine it was only $60 bones, and it was phenomenal! and a chain! Seriously, WTF.   Thankfully Vegas has some amazing food... just. not. here.",

    "text": "Thanks to past influences by the likes of Wynn and other corporate big shots, the Golden Nugget is truly the shining yellow star of the underrated downtown Las Vegas scene, and the Grotto Italian restaurant is an example of why the Nugget stands out, be it a little overpriced.  Location is nicely tucked next to the casino without the distraction, and next to the beautiful new pool and fish/shark tank area, and we lucked out by getting a table with a tank view.  Another plus were that they were very accommodating to my kids. You don't often get a kids menu and crayons at a place like this, and my five-year-old could stop watching the sharks.   I had been told the veal dishes here were the highlight, and my veal dish didn't disappoint. Nice sauce, just the right tenderness and tasty. But it didn't quite taste like a $28 dish to me.  Decent wine selection, and the apricot iced tea needed no Splenda.  Desert (chocolate cake) we all share was good, though nothing special. Had about as good at several of the local cheap buffets.  Overall, might have been closer to three 1/2 stars if the option was available. Food was very good, but not worthy of a five-diamond mention and you lose a star for being overpriced.  Best eats downtown remains the Main Street Station buffet, and you can get that for less than half the cost of Grotto's veal.",

But they sat us and took an order, so I expect the service to be normal. Anyway, waitress was polite enough, but didn't know when to leave the table, just carried on chatting. There was an occasion when she called over another waiter and they both stood there while we are trying eat. Quite uncomfortable. You have to know when to leave the table. Pasta sauce was WAY TOO SWEET. When I mentioned it to the waitress she just said it has to be that way because the recipe is set by the owner in Texas. All his restaurants have to do it the same way. No apology or understanding. I was going to order a bottle of red wine, but when I saw the prices I nearly choked. There was a wine I like that I can get (1500 miles away) in my home town for $11 at the local liquor store. In this restaurant it was gonna cost me $55. No way man. It aint a fine wine, and it's only from California NOT ITALY). Wife's margerita pizza was okay though, but a little soggy. Stuffed mushrooms were good but again, a little sweet on the sauce. Overall, not a pleasant relaxing experience. Too many different staff serving the table. I am Italian, and the food is not very authentic.  Do some homework, find where local Italians eat and get a cab there, the money you spend on the taxi will be made up for by the meal.

Don't know for Vegas but I've had better Italian in Seattle.  The house red was tasty though (pino noir blend).  I do agree with R.J's comment about the food being over seasoned.   Seriously, a little rosemary goes a long way",

    "text": "As far as downtown restaurants go, I think Grotto is pretty good.  Located inside the Golden Nugget, the bf and my good friend and her bf and I went there for Valentine's Day dinner.   Now, mind you, my 4-star rating does not mean this is a 4-star restaurant, similar to the ones on the Strip.   For the price, they give you a good amount of portions - definitely not trying to gyp you.  We shared the antipasto, stuffed mushrooms and the calamaris as appetizers.  All three were really good for what it's worth.   I had the seafood pasta, which was very delicious.  I tried a couple slices of the pepperoni pizza, and I thought that was worth mentioning as well.    I originally ordered the Aqua di Mare cocktail.  It was in the color of Windex, and it tasted like Windex to me (no offense).  I asked our server if I could change it, and he was very nice and was happy to change it for me.  They took the cocktail off the bill, and I was happy to make up in tips for that.    I cannot give Grotto 5 stars because it was more on the lax-side as far as the clientele.  It could have easily been a 5-star restaurant experience, but most patrons dressed too casually for my taste.  However, if you don't care about these things, then go to Grotto!  Have a relax night out in downtown Vegas where everyone is just there to enjoy themselves!",

If I was judging this based on food alone, Grotto Would get ten stars.   It takes forever to get a table. But it's Vegas- I get it. However, we had one waitress in particular who walked over to the table twenty minutes after we were sat, and instead of saying hello, said \"I hate people from Boston.\" Well, one member of our party is from Boston and found it especially rude. Later in the meal the waitress was ranting about the zombie apocalypse. Again, I understand this is Vegas, but it's still a 20$ a dish restaurant and people are trying to have a good meal.",

We sat at the bar and were treated as though we were an inconvenience. We are both service industry and were annoyed to receive brush off service. But that's ok, we understand that everyone has off days. I know that sometimes we both do. Our shrimp cocktail came out and we asked for extra horseradish. The woman who brought our food out acted as though we were asking for the moon. She said in a panicked voice that she would ask (I didn't feel like it was too much to ask?) and then she never returned and we never got the extra horseradish. Our pizza came out burnt, and I could see that the people on either side of us got pizza that looked crispy and delicious but the bartender never came to check on us so we didn't have an opportunity to point it out. We were planning on coming back down for a sit down dinner but after this afternoon I don't think we'll be back.",

So as far as being located in Vegas downtown I think it's a great venue for celebratory occasions.  I only tried three items, the bread, artichoke & spinach dip, and the Cannelloni di Pollo.  It would have been nice to have vinegar on the table along with the oil for the bread.  I thought the artichoke and spinach dip was okay.  I found it to be a little watery for my taste.  I enjoyed my Cannelloni di Pollo.  It was only an an appetizer portion but after stuffing my face with bread it was the perfect portion.  Being that it was a large party I was pleasantly surprised that the waitress gave us all separate checks.  I know none of us were expecting that as we were prepared with cash.    Will I go here again?  Probably not.  There is just much better Italian food in Vegas at a much better price point.",

They had found it online and were very much looking forward to eating at a restaurant with an aquarium.  Upon arrival, they were so disappointed to find that the restaurant had just a distant view of a very small aquarium in the pool area.  It was nothing like they had expected.  For our meal, we ordered 2 Grotto salads to start (very basic chopped lettuce & tomatoes with a vinaigrette), a margherita pizza (just ok), a bowl of soup (very bland), a chopped salad with chicken & the half rotisserie chicken with roasted potatoes & sauteed spinach (the chicken was very dry and I only ended up eating a few bites of it).  We declined dessert, though those looked really good.  All in all, the meal was very mediocre and we woud not eat there again.",

First our iced tea orders were taken and we were brought some slices of standard Italian bread with a container of olive oil for dipping.   I ordered the special of the day, a risotto with lump crab.  My wife ordered the Pollo Romano, a chicken breast--\"Romano crusted chicken scaloppine\" and served with penne in a sugo rosa.  My wife's chicken was very good but there was more of a breading taste than romano to the chicken.  The penne was very bland.  A little salt helped that along.  My risotto was good and there was a fair amount of crab meat.  We shared a slice of mezza notte chocolate cake.  It's very rich and very good.  Lots of chocolate drizzled with chocolate.  Service was good.  Iced tea was refilled and the server took my Landry's card early and linked it to our order.    While you can sit along the windows by the pool, I didn't push for that.  The one table remaining along the window had a large man with a tattooed back almost pressed against the window.  Needless to say, that wasn't a view of the pool I wanted to have.  The place is quite noisy from both music, table talk, and people walking through this way to go to the Rush Tower or back the other way.  It wasn't a detriment to the dinner--just an observation.",

The bread on the table was warm and fresh. The customer service is very good and our waiter was awesome (sorry I don't remember his name). It did take 45 minutes for our main courses to arrive. It's incredibly loud in this place and it's hard to understand what anyone else is saying at the table so you will find yourself screaming or constantly repeating yourself and we had six people in our party. As the restaurant is adjacent to the pool if you sit by the window you might get your appetite ruined by having to look at a sea of obese people in their bathing suits, such is Vegas. Each one of was was happy with the main dish we ordered. Pizza rocks and Iove their Ceaser Salad and their cheesecake!",

Now this is not a review on Fremont Street, but wow, that place is crazy. I was hungry. I looked around and all I saw were more hotels. But by now, I've realized, everything to do in Vegas is in a hotel. So we walked around, walking in and out of hotels looking for food. No, I didn't use Yelp to guide me this time. However, I was not disappointed.   We ventured through a hotel and saw that there was this little Italian restaurant. I'm always down for Italian, so I convinced my dad that we should eat here. We walked in and were greeted and seated immediately. We sat and began looking over the menu. It was dark in there. Dad had to pull out his phone's flashlight to read the menu.  I ordered the rigatoni with meatballs. I liked my selection. It was pretty basic, but that's how I like to eat. The meatballs were crumbly, I guess you could say. My dad said that's from bread crumbs they use within the meatballs. Fancy.   As we were finishing up our meal, we saw the table next to us had the dessert cart next to it, and they were being told their options. We listened in and decided we must get dessert. I get my sweet tooth from dad. I ordered the chocolate cheesecake with Oreo crust. It was definitely the best part of my meal. Yum. They had tons of dessert options, so whatever your preference, I'm sure you'll find something to satisfy your sweet tooth as well.   Overall, I had a great experience dining out with dad here. The food was good. The service was on point. They had a wide variety of entrees and desserts to choose from. I would recommend this place to others in the area!",

The bread was strong (bread is important). If you're into people watching, this is your spot. Just sit on the bar side.   If you go outside to Fremont St, be prepared for what you might see.

The reviews were decent and the menu looked good.   I was greeted and sat down promptly. My waitress was very friendly and gave me some good suggestions on which shows to see.   The 1st experience of this place was going good. She brought me out some warm bread and some oil that had garlic and herbs in it. It was delicious. I thought things were promising. I decided to order the Mahi with shrimp, asparagus and instead of the potatoes I asked to sub them for angel hair pasta, which they did with no issue. The fish was cooked well and wasent dry and the shrimp was not over cooked. The reason for the lower rating is the sauce that smothered it. It was a weird tomato sauce that I feel really ruined the dish for me. The sauce and my taste buds didnt agree. I would have preferred the dish without it.  If you order ask for the sauce on the side instead. Then you can be the judge.",

Self park and valet was completely full so we were a little late for our reservation but the hostess' Veronica and Cara were so nice about it and sat us right when we got there.   We ordered an app, main courses, and desserts, everything was so delicious. Our waiter Santos was the absolute best! He was very welcoming and knowledgeable about the menu. He answered any questions we had about the menu and gave us recommendations of what to try. He was always on top of if we needed anything- our water/bread was never empty. If we visit again I will definitely request Santos as our server and anyone who is reading this should too!!   *Bruschetta - super fresh  *Penne Con Gamberi al Limone - this pasta was so good, had lots of flavor and the shrimps were huge!  *Chicken Marsala - my boyfriend ate every last bite of this, it comes with a side of fettuccine alfredo *Strawberry Cassata - this dessert is so light and fluffy, just melts in your mouth!  *Grotto's New York Style Cheesecake - can you ever go wrong with cheesecake??",

The restaurant is situated across from the pool, so if your seating is in that area, your able to watch the shark tank as you feast.   There is lots of table seating, an extensive wine rack plus modern art on the walls. Very nice atmosphere.  Today we took advantage of their $15.00 (2) course menu, plus dessert, and hot tea ( which comes in a box for you to select )  We ordered the Lasagne Forno, Tomato soup ,Rotisserie Chicken, Caesar salad,  Lime Gelato, and Strawberry Cassatta ( their signature dessert)   The food was wonderful in taste, I especially loved the Cassatta you can taste the almond in every bite.   Our server was very personable and accommodating. I thoroughly enjoyed this meal and would recommend.   Location is The Golden Nugget- parking is garage, street, or lots.",

    "text": "Grotto Ristorante is inside the Golden Nugget in downtown Las Vegas. It is a weird place, a throwback to \"old\" Vegas. It feels like it's a place where \"everybody knows your name,\" so it is quaint and old school.  The seating is either inside the restaurant proper (more likely at night), or in a limbo state of a hallway lounge (which is not as bad as it sounds) during the day, for lunch.  The hallway lounge area has carpet, comfortable vinyl seats, and faces the hotel pool.  It is orange and beige and very surreal.  Squinting up at it near the window in the restaurant, you feel almost that you are in a cruise ship.  It's fun! It's odd.  The vibe is very 80-year old golfers, but SO uncool, it's inverted hip.  You can't beat the lunch deal.  $15 for 2 courses! The first course we selected was the DELICIOUS tomato soup with basil and dill.  Yum, yum, and yum.  The second course I got was the Scallopine with spinach.  (Not on the menu, but an adaptation because I divulged to the very nice waiter that I was on a \"keto\" meal plan.  Ordinarily, this dish comes with a side of mouthwatering pasta--I know, because I saw a nearby dining neighbor get it, and I resisted the urge to grab a fistful of spaghetti and run back to my table).  My lunch partner ordered the lasagna, and I was seriously fighting food envy, and cursing keto.  It looked boss! And by the way she was devouring it, (albeit politely, no elbows on the table), I KNEW it was good, without her having to say so (though she did).  The portions were generous, and both of us had to take doggy bags.    Now this is not my normal food foray.  It's not hipster bro, trendy, foodie fabulous, exotic epicurean, or deep comfort food.  It was perfect to open my eyes and broaden my downtown horizons.  The hostess and our server were excellent.  But the whole experience was a little weird, almost like I was having a lunch at a quality nursing home cafeteria with a very excellent chef.  And you know what...? I think I like it.",

Walking into the Golden Nugget we found this restaurant located right next to the casino that looked promising. The restaurant wasn't busy at first so we were sat right away. I was surprised that I couldn't smell smoke since the casino was right next door. Staff was quick to greet us and bring bread with a sauce dish with olive oils and chopped garlic; very tasty but it would have been nice to have a bigger dish for the olive oil since all we got was olive oil bread since the garlic was at the very bottom. We ordered the Bruschetta and it was so yummy. (Sorry guys I took no pictures; I was so hungry we just dug into the food) and then came the food... presentation was beautiful and matched the taste. We decided to share all meals. I chose the lasagna $18-mine was the favorite of everyone. My sister chose the Chicken Marsala $21- I truly enjoyed this one, I'm not a fan of mushrooms but everything mixed very well that you didn't have that potent mushroom taste. My mother chose the Chicken Parmigiana $21- also very tasty, the marinara sauce was delicious. The food was so good I really paid no attention to the service but now that I think about it food was out quickly and staff worked as a team to clear empty dishes and refill if needed. I will definitely come back here again the next chance o get.",

Imagine warm, soft on the inside, slightly crunchy on the outside bread, dipped in an olive oil marinated with basil, garlic, and red peppers.  As you scoop up some of the fresh basil still in the oil you will thank me.   My oldest son got the 12oz New York steak special.  It came with Alfredo, and asparagus. (Also comes with bleu cheese on top but he declined it). He practically licked the plate clean, and raves about the steak the whole time.   My younger son got the Alfredo, and devoured every bite.   My husband got the salmon with shrimp and said it was very good. The salmon cane skin one, which he loves, and the skin was still crispy.   I got spaghetti, which was fine, but not as good as my bread. My son finished it off with their dark chocolate cake, which smelled like heaven, and from the look all over his face, tasted like it too",

Seriously, I like sweets to a certain point but I was politely told to leave some for the rest of our posse. Sorry, I kinda lost control of myself. Lol. The food and service is high quality. And fun! It might seem pricey but the quality of the meals, preparation, skills of the kitchen, wait staff, management, is absolutely worth having a wonderful dining experience at this wonderful establishment.

The chicken with mushrooms and lemon garlic sauce was was so flavorful. I also had the tropical sunset which I loved as I enjoy sweet drinks. My boyfriend had the tomato basil soup and lasagna dish and loved every bit of both. We both cleaned our plate leaving nothing behind. Waiter and service was excellent. I highly recommend.",

    "text": "Let me preface by saying the 3-stars came strictly from the food and the amazing table we had.  After the Lillie's Noodle House BS (see review), we were irritated, flabbergasted, and hungry. We weren't in the mood to head to the Strip, nor were we wanting to search Downtown for a place to eat. We happened upon the Grotto and snatched up a seat. We put our name in and were told it would be 20-30 minutes, not too bad. We all needed a drink and decided to head to the bard for drinks and maybe an appetizer. We sit down and look over a dinner menu. The same blonde, short-haired, older lady kept sprinting by us. After a few times, she said she'd be right with us. After a few more times, she stops by our table to ask if we were waiting for a table in the restaurant, we said we were, and she said, \"Oh thank God, that's the best news I've heard all night\" and goes back to the Indy 500. She laps us multiple times before we flag her down to order. She took our order and began her foot race all over again. Within five minutes we had our alcohol but no water. She gave us the excuse, \"it's hard to get water around here\" and continued her sprints. I felt bad for her because it seemed she was the only one working as a bar server and she was running around frazzled and stressed, but come on, it's not that hard to get water. She ran by at least three more times with the same excuse. I paid the tab, gave her a pretty good tip, and it was time for dinner. We never ordered our appetizer.  My brother walked up to the hostess station and mentioned that it had been about twenty minutes. One of the girls said she could seat us now and then grabbed four menus and walked off in the direction of the table, leaving my brother in the middle to make the decision to get our attention or to follow Speedy Gonsalez. He followed her and made it to the table with just enough time for to thrown down the menus and mutter, \"Enjoy\". We eventually caught up.  Our table was against the glass overlooking the beautiful pool and shark tank, which was lit nicely for the evening. In need of a other drink and dinner, we checked the menu and decided what we wanted to eat. Silent Bob, our waiter, walked past the table multiple times, never acknowledging us. Finally, after the bus boy brought us water and set down the bread and olive oil (very good), our order was being taken. I think the waited maybe said four words to us. The pattern of passing our table continued until our drinks and appetizer (bruschetta) were ready. The bruschetta was amazing!  Dinner came out about twenty minutes later and was delicious. I can't recall what we ordered because I was so appalled by the whole evening. First, we're basically told that we're not wanted in Lillie's and then we're basically ignored at Grotto.  The food here was good, deserving of a full five star rating. Too bad service counts in my book, this restaurant barely deserves my generous three-star rating.",

    "text": "We came on a Friday night for dinner, and booked a table through Open Table. And we are also Landry Club member. So we would think that it would be a nice dinner. It turned out that the dinner was an upsetting experience because of a very bad server.  We ordered a Capricciosa Pizza and ONE caesar salad. When the salad came, we were given 2 half salads. I was already feeling weird about it. When we ordered, we did say A caesar salad. We didn't say \"two half caesar salads\". And we weren't asked if we would like to split it too. But it came out split. So I wasn't sure what was going on. I didn't even know that we would be charged more for comsuming the 2 half salads. We just thought that maybe they were nice enough to split it into 2 portions. We weren't asked at all so and the menu didn't even state any option of half salad of splitting salad. So we didn't have any clue that we should have asked about it before putting the salad into our mouths. Besides, the server was very not attentive to us while she was attentive to every other tables she served. So we were like \"what's wrong with her?\"  At the end the check came, we were charged for 2 half salads instead of 1 full portion of caesar salad. 1 full portion of caesar salad costs $9.99 but 2 half salads cost $11.98. So of course we were upset about it! The server was being unfair to us to make the call of splitting the salad without even asking us first. I feel that she should be the one paying our meal because of how she treated us (see below).  We are really upset with the server. The server always attempted to take away our food while we were still working on it. When we were working on the pizza, when there was still half a pizza left on the pizza plate, the server attempted to take away our pizza and said \"you are all done?\" We said \"no, we are still working on it. What kind of manner was that?? She could have asked if we are still working on the pizza without any action done first. She did the same when we were working on our dessert. She was so off, way too off. I was nice enough to write $2 as tips for her at the end. She really didn't deserve any tip as that's not called service. She doesn't deserve any gratuity when she was trying to rush people out of the restaurant. But I did observe and she was nice to all other people. And I really had to come down to a conclusion that she might be a racist! We got so upset. And I was very hungry and tired that night so I didn't have the energy to think what I could have done while we were still at the restaurant. So after taking a shower that night, my mind got clear and I was able to think. Then I realized how stupid I was as I should have brought it up to the manager, and I shouldn't have given her any tip (It's not about money, it's about teaching her a lesson, if she is going to have tip with such a horrible manner, she is going to continue doing that as she thinks she's entitled). So the other morning, we went to the restaurant and spoke with the manager about how unfair it was that we were charged for 2 half salads while we didn't ask for it. And we were upset at the server rushing us. The manager felt very sorry about it so she treated us lunch afterwards. We got a lasagna and a caesar salad again for lunch.  The food is worth 4 starts honestly. The pizza, the lasagna and the salad were worth 4 stars. The dessert Strawberry Cassatta was worth 3 stars, it was not bad tasting, just not surprising either. We were just so upset with the server so she made the whole experience 2 stars. The manager was worth 4 stars as she was nice, sincere, was very reasonable and understanding us. I just feel bad for them to have a bad apple being a server, who has the potential to ruin the reputation of the restaurant so badly.  We are giving 2 stars for this review because of the bad server we had for the dinner.   The lunch that the manager treated us actually deserved 4 stars, we also had a different server for that lunch too. We accepted the apologies and will still try Grotto again in the future when we visit vegas, especially because we really like their pizza and lasagna. We will just have to make sure that we won't have that bad server ever again in the future when visiting Grotto, and probably ask for another server if we unluckily get another bad one in the future.",

    "text": "This is actually 3.5 stars  The good:  This is one of those places that has been a \"must\" whenever we go to Las Vegas!  I absolutely love the spinach salad.  Since I am a creature of habit, once I find something I love I kinda get it again and again.  I've had the spinach salad consistently for years.  Yep, i love it that much!  The pasta dishes are excellent and the pizzas are delicious too!  Never made it to dessert so one day I'll have to try some.  What you might not know:  This place is part of the Landry's Select club and you can accumulate your visits to earn those $25 rewards.  Also in the Golden Nugget is the another Landry's restaurant, a steakhouse, Vic and Anthony's.  Delicious!  The review on most recent visit:  I would've given this restaurant five stars except for my most recent visit...  Let me start by saying that the wait staff is usually excellent, attentive and professional.  However, on our last visit in July, our salad was delivered to the wrong table by a man who appeared to be a waiter and we had to wait a while to have one remade and brought to our table.  Mind you, we were there at least fifteen minutes before the other couple.  Let's just say, we watched as the other couple enjoyed our salads and continued to wait.  Finally, our salads came... No apology from our waitress except oh, it was delivered to the wrong table and that was the second time he did it to her that night, fourth time overall.... Hmmm...ok, so she was having trouble with another employee...she acted like she was irritated by him and the victim of the situation.  The only ones who got any benefit that night was the couple who had our salad for free. Can't blame the other couple though, it was their first time there and they thought the salad came with their meal.  I think for our inconvenience, we should've been comped a salad too, or  at least been given dessert after our pastas for our inconvenience and having to be put between what seemed to be some sort of problem between two employees.    I'm just glad that this wasn't my first time there or I would be missing out on some really good food, cause I would not go back.  This type of experience would be the type of incident that would keep first timers from returning.  If this type of incident was to keep occurring, I would seriously think about making it a \"must\" on future visits to Las Vegas.  Vacations are supposed to be fun and relaxing, not irritating and an inconvience where you're sitting around and waiting for your starter for over half an hour.   So, minus one star for waiter/waitress discrepancy and another half cause lots of time was wasted and were not given an apology, but an irritated excuse.  Any other restaurant where something like this happens, patrons are valued and given something comped or at least an apology instead of excuse.  We were done well after the restaurant closed, and should've made an attempt to speak to a manager, but hey we were on vacation and so much precious time had already been wasted.",

After spending the day at Hoover Dam and really needing some refreshments when we returned to the hotel we decided to just stay in and eat in house.  First of course we had to spend time at the bar and quaff a few (ok, way more) cold ones, enjoy the ambiance and a nice guy bar tender named Andy.    Andy even provided some bread with olive oil dip later on (I guess there's a name for it, but all I know is it hit the spot after much beer) when we decided to make a reservation and just eat there.  After an hour or so wait (and more beer) we sashayed (ok, stumbled) into the main room to enjoy some delicious Italian food.  Excellent shrimp cocktail followed by (by me) some spaghetti with meatballs and sausage, ( I wanted old school), were served by Arturo our waiter, in a friendly and efficient manner.  We even had some GREAT cheesecake and other deserts, which on top of the beer and food made me so happy later on that the wife remembered to pack the bottle of Tums. Andy the bartender even stopped by to say hello and say he enjoyed talking to us while we were getting bombed at the bar.  A great experience all the way around.  Staying at the Golden Nugget is always fun for us, but being able to eat and drink (to excess even) and have such a great time and excellent meal at the same time and place made it even better.  Looking forward to next time.  Thanks Grotto.",

One actually stood at the bar chatting with his friends. Seriously? After 6 minutes of being ignored, we left. There are lots of restaurants around, too bad you don't care to pay attention to us.",

The service was great because my friends mom and grandma had to go to the airport at 7:30, so she asked if they can get our orders out quickly and they did.

    "text": "With faux-Tuscan arches accented by whimsical Italian maxims (Due Piedi Non Possono Stare In Una Scarpa--\"Two Feet Can't Fit In One Shoe\") and fanciful chandeliers, The casino-side Grotto doesn't promise anything remarkable. So it's all the more impressive to discover it offers many common dishes uncommonly well done.   We got off to a good start with soft Italian bread with garlicked olive oil...Calimari Toto promises that you're getting all the octopus--authentically Italian--fresh but flavorful pieces of the tentacles and head, in a light egg batter that makes it hard to stop eating... meatballs come two near-baseballs to an order, a thin crust protecting the piping hot, almost pate-soft inside (which they claim is all flavorful beef chuck, though you'll suspect more tender veal). The Italian Chopped salad balances proscuitto, bacon, egg, with Gorgonzola and provolone cheeses with iceberg lettuce so deftly that the thin-sliced grilled chicken breast on top seems unncessary.   Chicken and seafood are clearly the strengths here (though they also make their own fresh pastas)...particularly the Roasted Herb chicken, a half-bird rotisseried with rosemary over white oak and nothing less than tender, savory perfection.   But the pizzas deserve equal attention, especially considering how few and far between are good pies found in the city. Grotto's hand-tossed rustic rounds, cooked in a wood burning stove in the middle of the dining room, taste just like you'd expect from a street cafe in Napoli...but maybe a bit better. Our margherita, hitting the table in a cloud of aroma, didn't have a chance of survival.   The garlicky sweet marinara sauce that accompanies many dishes is the kind of recipe you could easily crave, fresh, simple yet deceptively complete.   A small wine list offers a baker's dozen reds and ten whites by the glass, including their own robust chianti-esque Rock N Roll blend, totally acceptable.  Beware that huge dessert cart--it will call you, with the signature featherlight wedding cake, dense and deadly chocolate mezza notte, respectable tiramisu, and certainly not least of all, a solid New York cheesecake with strawberry cream, impressively authentic.  Lunch diners get a voyeuristic view of action at The Tank pool deck, and a limited selection of their most popular items, augmented by some creative panini, and an old school \"Nugget\" salad.  I think they have good deals on the pizzas during happy hour.",

Still wanting Italian, we took a quick walk down to The Golden Nugget and quickly got a seat at the bar at Grotto. The atmosphere was pretty cool at the bar since you got to watch them make their pizzas. I had the seared mozzarella appetizer which was delicious (especially the tomato sauce it was in.) The veal scaloppini in the main dish was very good as well. The highlight of the meal was the strawberry dessert. This was about two weeks ago and I can't remember the name of the dessert, but just get it. It was delicious. I tried to replicate it as soon as I got home and it wasn't close. Ask your server, they will know what it is. It's almost cake, cream, strawberries, and magic I think. The only complaint was that the service was a little slow.

Then when she did bring our drinks, or should I say drink, she forgot my wife's wine. Fine, we told here to just make sure that it was not on the bill.  We ordered a pasta plate, and a chicken margarita pizza. Pasta, well, to be honest, was so, so, but not bad. The pizza, oh, the pizza........ it was absolutely the worst thing I have eaten in a long time. For me to spit out my food in a restaurant, wow, something has to be horribly wrong. Well it was. The chicken tasted like it was 2 weeks old. No joke, no exaggeration, old chicken has to be one of the worst things you can put in your mouth. Now imagine a piece of pizza you had just bitten into being covered in it!!!! We informed the waitress, who must be an out of work actress, because she said that she could not believe what we were telling her and that she would look into it with the chef.   So we waited for some kind of response as to what may have gone wrong, after about 15 min of waiting, the manager comes over and tells us that he cannot belive that the chicken was like that and that the chef was looking into it. Then he just walked away. No joke, no apologies, no comping the meal, nothing, he just repeated the same thing to us that the waitress had told us 15 min earlier and walked away!!! My wife and I were going to walk out, but, unfortunately for us we have ethics. Finally we were able to get the attention of our waitress and got our bill, paid for the food we had eaten and left.  Please don't ever eat here, I don't want you to have to find out what old chicken, and I mean really old chicken taste like, the way that we had too. Also, to be treated so cold by the manager, and a forgetful waitress is absolutely unacceptable. In today's economy businesses need to appreciate any and all customers who walk into their establishment.  Never, ever again.",

I gotta say the drinks and apps were good, but the sarcastic wit and personality of the bartender is what made this such a memorable spot.",

We arrived at 10:30 am and was told breakfast was over but could still order an omelette..my husband did but all I wanted was toast and coffee.. Omelette was ok but toast was cold, limp and soggy. Come on!  Can get toast right.  For some reason I let my husband talk me into going back for dinner.. I ordered the veal house special. I asked the waiter about it and he said it was the highest quality veal and his personal favorite. At $24.99 a dish I figured it was worth it to get the highest quality veal.  Omg.. It's came out of a freeze for sure. I received 4 tiny medallions all the exact same size with 1 slice of a mushroom on top . It was so breaded that any veal that might have been in it was lost forever. I would beat it came out of the freezer.. It was cold and the worst piece of something I ever ate. My husband ordered the pasta which was the smallest portion I have ever seen ($20.00). I was soooo disappointed .. The waiter knew I was not happy and did offer to replace my meal with something else. At that point I said forget it.  If I could give a negative number review I would.",

So we decided to go to Grotto, boy we were glad we came here.  We ordered:  - fried calamari comes with their yummiest tomato sauce (i never like tomato sauce but this one is so delicious i ate it clean), the calamari was dry not oily like other restaurant.. very good. - lobster bisque ... very good. the best lobster bisque beside the one i tried at the four seasons hotel san francisco. They gave a good chunk of lobster meat.. so delicious. Just don't order it to go because i liked it so much i ordered it to go and they didn't give the lobster meat at all.. so disappointed. - chicken alfredo linguine.. good, the white chicken meat is good but it is not grilled like what i expected, i think it was sliced roasted chicken but the overall is good because it is not greasy not too much butter and i didn't feel bloated after that.  Their bread was good, served warm and so yummy, one of the best bread but you have to ask because they won't give out the bread unless you ask for it.  The only thing that was off: the food took a while to get out, we had to wait for each of the food to get out and the restaurant was not even crowded.",

    "text": "This is a very pretty atmospheric place with great service.  The food was okay, nothing to  write home about but passable.  The bruschetta is a really nice appetizer, although it apparently was inconsistent from one time to the next, as my out of town relatives were disappointed that the bread seemed to be different from their previous visit. Nonetheless, it was quite tasty.  The Tiramisu dessert unfortunately really missed the mark...I've had much better and it didn't taste at all of coffee or any type of liquor, more like caramel or something.  So, that was the main downpoint.  Eggplant parmesan was okay, could have used a bit more seasoning as the eggplant flavor didn't come through in the dish itself, but hey, it was still good, a large portion (for me anyway), served hot and fresh..... and for the blend of atmosphere and very attentive service you get here, you could do worse than coming to The Grotto for dinner.  If I came back would try other things on the menu, maybe the pizza, as I'm sure there are some stand outs that are quite good.  Have fun! You won't be disappointed in this place unless you're looking for top of the line Italian...it's an enjoyable overall place to hang out, especially for out of town friends and family.  (the fish tank and waterfall/pool  area while a bit noisy is all part of the action and fun of Las Vegas!",

    "text": "Where do I begin? First and foremost, it was my wife's birthday so I had high expectations for dinner. I couldn't have been more disappointed in literally EVERY dish. We started with a couple appetizers (calamari and meatballs). Awful. Both dishes were obviously frozen prior and were served room temp. The calamari had a mushy breading and the squid itself was rubbery. All dishes were seemingly ordered from Cisco or Costco. The meatballs were  tragic. The sauce tasted canned and was very sweet. The meatball itself was flavorless and unseasoned.   For our main courses, my wife ordered her favorite cut of steak, filet mignon medium rare. It arrived totally raw in the center and in fact was cold on the exterior indicating it was also, tragically, frozen. I ordered a 4oz New York steak ordered medium well and it arrived on a scalding plate but was cold in the center. Unfortunately, the heat lamp the dish sat under for some time wasn't able to heat the meat through!  In addition, we ordered a ravioli dish that was quite simply, another Costco purchase. Rubbery, flavorless and served with a dated presentation style. Peas as a garnish, no need to go further on that point.   All in all, the service was not memorable but not bad. The staff clearly had no integrity in their craft which I found just plain sad. We paid for dinner and didn't want to cause a scene complaining to staff. They were kind enough to take the appetizers and steak off our bill seeing that we didn't eat them.   It was a total disappointment that took several after dinner cocktails to forget about the experience.   Do yourself a favor and don't bother dining at Grotto Ristorante",

The pizza is excellent and only $8 at happy hour every day (I think).   The wedding soup is absolutely my favorite and has chicken meatballs instead of beef, perfectly seasoned and easy to slice with your spoon. Light broth, super flavor, soooo Yummy!  I don't eat beef/pork/veal, so my menu choices are limited by my own preferences, so I haven't found an entree that I love yet. The lemon is a bit heavy in their lemon/butter sauce, but the rosa sauce is tasty. We like to grab appetizers and soup at the bar usually anyway, and have never left the Grotto disappointed or hungry!   The seared mozzarella appetizer is a warm version of caprese (same basic ingredients but cooked and prepared very differently) and we loved it!",

    "text": "Let me begin with how shocked I was once I entered the Golden Nugget. I did not expect it to be so nice. A couple of friends and I were going out for lunch. I was early, so I took a stroll around the property and was blown away by how modern and clean everything was.  At first, I was apprehensive about the separated dining area. During peak hours, crossing traffic to get to the part near the pool must be similar to playing Frogger with a banquet tray. The weather was gorgeous and the pool is beautiful, so I understand why they seat this area first. As the first party there, for lunch, we got a central table near the window.   October is pizza month. They are running a chef's special for $9.99. The special is a basic cherry tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil pizza. It was delicious and easily shared between two. So why in the world did we get bruschetta, chicken fettuccine alfredo, and lasagna? Both pastas also comes with an Italian salad. It was was overkill. Yet, it was also a death I am willing to experience again. I am not a huge fan of cream sauces, but I even took a few bites of the pasta. The lasagna was my favorite. It is a bit more saucy than I normally like, but the flavor was good. The pizza is a thin crust style that I was thankful for because I could not handle any more carbs. By the time all three of us were finished we had enough to send someone home with leftovers.",

    "text": "The Stawberry Cassata dessert at The Grotto is the entire reason I planned our trip to Vegas February 20th. We had previously eaten here in 2007. My husband does not typically go for dessert, sweets, cakes or much breadish items in general, but he loves strawberries, so the first time here he ordered it, and has talked about it for years!! I have called several locations trying to have a cake shipped to me around his birthday with no luck! So this year I thought \"I'm just taking him to that cake!\" One we arrived for our 7PM reservations we were offered patio seating for our special occasion and the gorgeous weather! It took a while to be greeted by our server, but we are typically leisurely and understanding at restaurants, especially on vacation! Another server made sure we were okay and insured that we had been helped by someone. Another table was a little more displeased and vocalized it to us. Having worked in food years ago, I'm more patient and understanding, especially when it seems someone is \"in the weeds\". All in all our server was great, food was delicious! The manager directed me to the restroom, and helped me have this cake brought out to my husband with a candle. We hope the next time we're here is much sooner than 7 years!",

    "text": "Fourteen of my friends and I had dinner at the Grotto tonight on Fremont Street.   The service was fabulous although we only had one waitress and she handled it well.    PROS:  The chopped salad was great and there was a huge plate of it, enough for 6 of us to share.  The Spaghetti Bolognese was good but just good, not great, not memorable. At $19.00 per plate it SHOULD have been better.   The Chicken Piccata was also a good choice with lots of lemon and loaded with capers and served with a generous helping of angel hair pasta and asparagus.  A few in our party ordered the cannaloni appetizer ($9.00 each) and loved it.     CONS:  The thin crust pizza fell apart under the weight of the large amount of cheese, sausage and peppers.  The crust tasted more like crackers than pizza dough.  The flavor of the pizza topping was very good, but hard to handle.  We shared all of these  dishes among 6 of the 14 so we ordered 4 extra meatballs along with the two that came with the Spaghetti Bolognese.  The meatballs were huge but we felt that $4.00 for each meatball was a little over the top.    The dessert cart is very interesting to look at but the coconut cream pie (a huge slice) was almost all whipped cream.  I would have liked a little more coconut cream.   At $8.00 per slice it was hard to swallow.  LOL.  The restaurant itself is loaded with Italian atmosphere and very comfortable but noisy.  Some tables face the awesome aquarium at poolside so try to ask for a table there.   Probably won't go back there again and that's too bad since we're locals and frequent the restaurants on the Strip and Fremont Street.",

    "text": "While staying at the Golden Nugget and consuming all of the gluttonous food and beverage that Fremont Street has to offer, my friend and I decided we needed a nice big salad for lunch.  The restaurant is right next to the beautiful pool and the awesome shark tank & water slide.  We were lucky enough to sit by the window and it felt like we were sitting on a patio on a perfect sunny day (which it was, but we were inside).  I decided on the Italian chopped salad and was very happy.  The salad was great and I couldn't believe I ate the entire mound of chopped delicious ingredients.  I did get the dressing on the side, so I'm not sure how much they would usually put on the salad.   We brought the boys back for the end of happy hour so we could check out the pizzas on special for $6 (happy hour is from 2-6). They were a great size for the price, thin crackery crust, and delicious toppings.  The drink prices were not great on happy hour, but I've learned that is pretty consistent for The Golden Nugget.  Then again, it would make sense seeing as how it is a step up from the rest of the hotels on Fremont.   The server for lunch was very nice, however the bartenders for happy hour seemed a little less than happy. I know it can get crazy in a small bar area with everyone wanting to order, but when your working for tips a small smile every now an again won't hurt. I promise your face won't crack!  Overall, I'm a fan of Grotto and will go back for delicious food anytime I'm on Fremont.",

On the first occasion I shared the house salad, Chilean sea bass and strawberry cake dessert with my fiance.  The kitchen split up our meals which were the perfect portion.  I'm not a fish person but I really enjoyed my meal.  On the second visit I went for happy hour and had a margarita pizza - yum!! Great drink specials too.  Finally I had my wedding reception here with 26 guests and Grotto delivered amazing service and food.  I definitely recommend this venue if you are looking for an affordable (about $40-50 per person), intimate restaurant with various dinner options.  Guests were able to choose from 2 salads, 3 entrees and 2 desserts - all of which were very tasty!  Upon first visiting Grotto, I was a little considered about privacy because they don't have a private dining room.  Our party was set up against the back wall of the restaurant and luckily it still felt like our own special event.  I'm so happy I went with this restaurant!  I basically planned my wedding using yelp reviews and if there's anyone needing a lovely setting for a large party, nice dinner out or decent happy hour, I strongly advise considering Grotto!",

And since I am a fan of Olive Garden, consider that a compliment.  But unlike Olive Garden, they do cater to the Vegas casino crowd by being open early for breakfast. This was first meal of the day at Grotto ... stumbling back into the Golden Nugget after a marathon session of brews and Sigma Derby at The D. Looking for something sweet and decadent, I ordered the cheese blintzes. I received four delicious, ample-sized blintzes with a side of fruit compote. I was happy and headed to my room for three hours of sleep before checkout.  My flight out of town wasn't until late that night, so after check out, I hung around Golden Nugget. After getting some additional rest and nursing my hangover poolside, I decided I needed some carby comfort food. So I went for round two at Grotto and settled on their Chicken Fettuccine Alfredo. It came with an ample portion of salad and bread - both good. The menu advertised homemade fettuccine, and the noodles were pretty darn good. The chicken was cooked nicely and tasty. The Alfredo sauce was a bit on the thin side for my taste, and could use a bit more cheese flavor, but it was still enjoyable. At $15, this was a pretty good deal for lunch from a casino.  The dining at Golden Nugget tends to shade towards pricy and upscale - what else would you expect from the parent company of Morton's? And the dining at DTLV tends to be either high-end or divey. Grotto is one of the few \"in-between\" options - they offer a reasonably-priced sit-down meal that is both tasty and a good value for your food dollar.. If you are looking something between the spectrum of fine dining and Fried Twinkies, Grotto is worth a try.",

The italian home-style salad was very good and the fettuccine alla campagnola was delicious. one of best italian dinners i have ever had. Service was impeccable and the decor of the restaurant is very nice, even though you are surrounded by the casino on all 4 sides. the bread with the olive oil was to die for also. LOVE it.",

    "text": "This is a upscale Italian  restaurant  with wide range of dinner options . The wife and I split a Caesar salad , one othe best I've had and the wife.agreed. Then we had the calamari app very good served with a red gravy ( marinara ) We then had a wood oven pizza that was delicious but this is we're the the only negative I have to report on. We order a proscutto pine nut and artichoke and got a  chicken goat cheese. You think You would notice right away but the red onion and shredded chicken impersonated proscutto and artichoke at first take.  Long story short the waitress knew it was the wrong pizza and asked if we wanted another pizza . We said no that this was fine. We thought  they would have comped the pizza on our bill which they did when we told the waitress she should do something abouther mistake. I know she asked us if we wanted another pizza and we said that this was fine . We were simply being accommodating and didnt want to wait for another pizza to cook .   So caesar salad $ 9.99 , calamari $11.99 wrong pizza $17.99 total bill $ 99.59 oh yes there was four alcoholic beverages  involved. Why has Vegas decided that a martini should cost $15.00 bucks. I guess because we the insipid consumer will pay for it. I'm just saying we are collectively the problem with over priced booze concert tickets sporting events etc...  Summary, the food is delicious the service was good  and the booze over priced. They have happy hour mon- fri 4 to 7 with half priced pizza and $4 beers . Good time to go..",

    "text": "We came to this restaurant on a whim after hanging out on Fremont Street, and it was one of the best impulse decisions made. The service was stellar -- even though we happened to show up while there was also a large party being served, the staff was very attentive to us as well as the other smaller tables. The food was excellent -- warm loaves of bread with garlic and basil infused olive oil for dipping are provided to every table, and we followed it up with perfectly tender calamari. Every person at my table had excellent reviews for our entrees, and understandably with a very large party ahead of us, the food was slightly delayed coming out, but honestly I've been to places like IHOP and waited far longer. Because of that little delay though, the manager provided dessert for free.   Which comes to the highlight of the dinner: the strawberry cassata. If you come to this restaurant you cannot leave without trying this Italian wedding cake or you're simply wasting your time. So light and fluffy and moist, I can confidently say it was the best dessert I've ever had. Every future trip to Las Vegas for me will include stopping at the Grotto for their strawberry cassata on my itinerary.   Special shout out to Carol of the wait staff, such a lovely and enthusiasticand funny woman!",

This was located in \"Old Vegas\"  and right inside the Golden Nugget, short walk from the hotel lobby.   There are two sections of seating and one is \"inside\" the restaurant while there is an outer area that hugs the huge glass walls, where you can look into the pool and aquarium / slide! It was really nice to zone out and have a nice view.  We ordered a salad (big enough to share between 2 or even 3), bruschetta, mushroom caps, and almost couldn't eat it all as we scarfed down the warm bread that came to our table shortly before.   Everything we ordered was to our liking and even with one member of our dining party being extremely rude and cranky (sorry!!) the wait staff was ever so gracious and patient.  Located super close to the Fremont experience, will definitely add this place as a must stop for a meal while in Vegas.   Valet parking is free and tip based so make sure to tip them.",

We saw a lot of sights, went to see the Million Dollar Piano concert featuring Elton John.......gambled, drank and ate at a bunch of restaurants.  By far the best food, drinks and service we received over the course of our time in Las Vegas was at The Grotto.  The Grotto is an Italian restaurant in the Golden Nugget Hotel and casino in downtown Las Vegas, right in the heart of the Fremont Street Experience.  Before I go any further I want to recognize our server, Ricardo.  WOW!!  Ricardo provided perhaps the best service I have experienced at any restaurant in my 50 year lifetime.  Super friendly, super accommodating, knowledgeable and efficient.  A perfect gentleman, and helped make this night memorable for all in our party.  Drinks were ordered (with Ricardo's help/input), and they were all amazing!  Dinner was ordered (once again with Ricardo's helpful knowledge and suggestions/flexibility), absolutely no complaints about the food.  In fact, once the entrees came our table became quiet for the first time as everyone was eating, and trying each others selections.  Complete satisfaction!    My sister in law apparently had told Ricardo that it was my birthday, so after the main course, here he comes with a piece of an amazing dessert which featured angel food cake and whipped cream (and much more).  We all tried it, and although no one was really very hungry, we ordered two more desserts; a piece of cheesecake and tiramisu for the table.  The cheesecake was the big winner of the three, by the way.  Overall, a huge shout out to The Grotto for providing an unforgettable evening.  Another huge shoutout to Ricardo.  I am positive that you should be recognized by your management for being such an outstanding server/employee.  I know that when we visit Las Vegas in the future, we'll be dining at The Grotto, and asking if Ricardo still works there.",

    "text": "Oh boy.  Where to begin.  We came here for dinner before the 3 Doors Down concert and did not have a pleasant experience.  We ordered a bottle of Querceto.  The first bottle was corked and our server agreed.  We got a new bottle and this one was corked as well.  At this time the GM came over and presented a \"special bottle\" he had.  It was Match Chardonnay.  You could just tell by looking at the bottle it was nothing special.    The dinner was OK.  Food was nothing special but our server was definitely trying.  We then got the check and the manager said he would just \"price match\" the Chardonnay to the $44 bottle of Querceto.  I thought this sounded suspicious as I didn't think the Match bottle was $44.  We then asked for a menu and sure enough \"Match Chardonnay\" isn't on their menu.  The GM then came over and said he would do their \"house Chardonnay\" price and on the new receipt it said \"Match Chardonnay\".  I work in F&B.  I know how menu items and button requests work.  The Match Chardonnay on the receipt said $33.  The unethical GM was trying to nickel and dime us when we had 2 bad bottles of wine.  Is this real life?    We are foodies and have met several other foodies out and about and have shared our story at any chance we get.  As a general manager or ethical human being your job is to wow the guest and to turn around negative experiences - not to rip the guest off hoping they wouldn't catch what you're trying to do.  This same bottle of wine is offered at Pizza Rock at GVR for $36 or so and they have half off wine night and their wine isn't corked.  Everything about the experience was \"meh\" but the experience with the GM was absolutely ridiculous.",

We were totally full but wanted to try the strawberry cheesecake, so we got it to go. Wow! Great way to finish a great meal from our hotel room.",

They serve complimentary fresh warm bread that was addicting  and this  infused dipping oil that tasted like it was made with Italian love and care.   We ordered the appetizer Shrimp scampi and the veal dinner with capers and lemon butter AMAZING! Honestly...one of the best!!  I have ever had of both items!!  Delicious!!!  The only reason I did not give a 5 star was the waiter forgot about us a couple of times, but he was pleasant and funny.",

The food is ok, not great however they will substitute eggplant for any meat, so it's a nice option for vegetarians. My veggie pasta was $19, and I thought that was a bit pricey and bland.  However my coworker loves the veal ($25). So it must depend on what you order.  Since it's an open floor plan and right off of busy hallways and next to the casino it's really noisy.   My favorite thing about the Grotto is you can order anything to go at the bar, enjoy a drink while it's cooking and take it up to the room.",

    "text": "Grotto is an excellent Italian restaurant kinda tucked away deep inside the Golden Nugget. I've passed it so many times on my way in, out, to the pool, to the check-in counter, through the casino - wherever. But I had never stopped in before during my six years of downtown tripping.   And I seriously regret that now.   Came in on a Thursday evening by myself, having just wrapped up a conference. Seeing no one in line, I first asked the hostess for a menu so I could spot something I liked. She happily obliged. Everything looked good to me, so I went in and sat down at the bar area, which is large and wraps all around a huge brick oven. I was pretty much the only one there, since it was so early (like around 6 pm).   A kind gentleman came out and provided a menu and a water. I looked it over and decided I was hungry enough to do an appetizer and a whole pizza. I asked if he had a favorite appetizer. He immediately pointed to the Three Cheese Ravioli, so I ordered it. I also ordered the Herb Chicken Pizza.   But first, let's not forget that ravioli. It was amazing. I mean really good. And really filling, too. I could have (and should have) made a meal off that dish alone. It was deep fried, covered in some outstanding spices, and the cheese inside was very tasty. I'd order two next time, eat both, then go buy some new pants.  And I just recently started asking servers for recommendations prior to ordering. And so far, I've been impressed everywhere I've done this. So I think I'll continue that trend in the future.   Now back to the meal. The Herb Chicken Pizza was not bad, just a little runny. I think it may have needed a couple more minutes in that authentic brick oven I sat across at the bar. Oh speaking of which, if you're going to sit at the bar, that's the best place to sit. I got to witness a myriad of interesting-looking (and attractive) pizzas coming out of that thing.   Based on the parade of pizzas, I think I'd go with the pepperoni next time. I noticed a lot of those coming out and they looked pretty good.   Customer service here is outstanding. I'm about as low-maintenance as they come, but I noticed my server constantly looking out for me. Kept the water glass full, cleaned the dirty dishes up quickly, and so on.   And he took it one step further when I went to pay. I had a $50 food & beverage credit from the Golden Nugget and wanted to use it when I paid. But for some reason, it didn't open up when I checked into the hotel a couple days earlier. So my server got on the phone, called two different people, and in about five minutes got it all cleared up. I think that was above and beyond.   And so was his tip!  So I really do regret not coming here earlier but plan to make it a regular stop on all future visits.  If you like Italian, I know you'll enjoy the food and atmosphere, too.",

I showed the server it's lack of warmth and it's lack of crispiness - he apologied and took it away, only to bring the same pizza back it's now too-hot-to-touch plate.  They did not redo it, but warmed it, making it more limp.  Tried to eat a few pieces with knife and fork.  Not too bueno.",

Our table had one of our party personally fetch the water pitcher for refills. Considering a slow Tuesday night, the lack of attention was disappointing.   The appetizers choices of antipasti and calamari were both excellent. A careful fork full of baby purple onion and blue cheese from the antipasti platter was the killer combination, if you're a fan. The calamari came crisp and tasty.   Entrees included a great Chicken Parmigiana; however, our server was confused with the Chicken Parmesan $10 monthly special we ordered. This was later corrected. Paglia e Fieno was expected to be lathered in a rich Parmesan cream sauce but ended up rather bland. Similarly, a less spicy version of Fettuccine Campagnola was served.   Tiramisu was an excellent desert choice. While a nice gesture to add a birthday candle on a desert we ordered, it was given to the wrong person.   A nice stop in Fremont but likely not to return.",

We walked in looking for something for dinner and were torn between this place and RAW (sushi). We know we made the right decision. The bruschetta was wonderful! And it's large. Really more than enough for 3+. We split the most comparable thing to a dinner salad, which was more like a chopped salad. It also was more than enough. It would have been too big for one if ordered with a meal. Finally we shared one of the house pasta specials (the name escapes me) with roasted peppers and sausage. Again, it was great.

The patatoes were way overcooked had no seasoning, looked burned and tasted old. The fish had a very bad taste to it. I had mahi before so I know how it tastes. The 3 piece of veggies that came with it didnt wow me either. If you charge $30 for a fish meal then deliver a $30 worth of a meal and not fast food style frozen food. The whole meal tasted like they took frozen fish warmed it up in the microwave and served it. Not fresh at all. Overall very disappointing experience for the money spend.",

The view was nice with a good look at the shark tank (unfortunately during pool hours views of overweight swimmers are also seen but after pool hours the view gets amazing)  We were brought more than enough bread which is the furthest thing from bad. The apps were brought hot and quick, along with our food. The penne was delicious and hot. I would give 4 stars but having this place but 3 and a half stars is much under the credit it deserves. I highly recommend going after 7:00.",

My friend and I ordered a Margarita pizza which had super thin crust, almost like a cracker. We asked for more sauce as it needed it, but the sauce was good.  And we shared a salad. We also had a glass of wine each. It was really quick. I saw other tables had bread, but we didn't. Another table order what appeared to be a meatball appetizer, don't get that, it didn't' look good! Couple other folks looked like they were picking up pizzas to go, which might be a great idea too.  They also played nice jazz music, which was odd since it was an Italian restaurant, but who am I to judge.",

They offered to take my cell # and call me when our table was ready.  It was ready right at about the 15 minute mark.  We received bread and water almost immediately after we were seated.  Kimmie, out waitress came over and introduced herself and took our drink orders.  I cannot say enough about Kimmie.  The restaurant was very busy and Kimmie was a dynamo in action, but she took the time to answer all our questions about the menu and keep our drinks full throughout our meal.  We started with the bruschetta and it was delicious.  My had the spinach, pear and bacon salad and the chicken piccata .  I had the tomato basil soup and the veal kickerello.  The soup was outstanding.  Creamy with a ton of tomato flavor.  The veal was tender with a touch of lemon served with fettucine alfredo.  The salad was good, my wife didn't care for the balsamic dressing, but Kimmie was happy to replace it with the house Italian.  The chicken piccata was very good as well.  It came with angel hair pasta and sauteed asparagus.  The asparagus was a little tough, but tasty.  I don't remember what is was called, but we had the angel food cake with strawberries.  It looks impressive and tasted out of this world.  I nice finish to a great meal.    The tomato soup was so good we had to come back and try it again along with one of their pizzas for lunch.  We split a pizza and a meatball panini and both had a cup of the tomato basil soup.  The soup again was great.  The pizza was thin crust and crisp on the edges, but just slightly not as crisp as I would like in the middle.  The meatballs were tasty, but I would skip the panini next time as it was just OK.  Service again was outstanding.  I wish we had a location of the Grotto near us as we would be regulars.",

We had a very large group for dinner on New Years Eve without a reservation. The restaurant seated all 10 of us in 15 minutes.   The food was really good and I had to stop myself from eating my pasta and sausage before I got too full. The house bread was soft and the dipping oil perfect. We split 2 orders of artichoke dip and it was cheesy goodness that didn't last.  Many diners got the manicotti like pasta roll which looked like a smaller portion than other dishes, but no complaints.  They very efficiently split the checks and cashed us out in time. And they were very very busy.  Only negative is that my husbands dinner was last to arrive by more than 10 minutes. I guess the kitchen failed the checkpoint-twice.   We would return, especially to sit in Denise's section and with this large group!",

I asked for a special order Margherita Pizza - I wanted the tomatoes added after baking with the fresh basil. It was Delicious!!  Thin crispy crust too!!

Unlike the pizza joints you may find on ever other street corner this pizza is a real treat! The crust is thin and light so you don't feel like you have a tummy full of dough when you leave.

Mix the oil around before you dip and you'll taste the fresh garlic -- mmmm!!    Worth every penny (entrees were $19-30) and drinks were ($6-10, beer, wine avg).
